            "content": "Some films are so bad, they're good. Meaning \"fun\" or \"entertaining\" or at least \"interesting\"... But few films can claim to be so dreadful, you actually feel physical pain while viewing them. So bad are these damned few that you don't experience them or watch them: you \"endure\" them. This is the mother of all such films!\"Manos the hands of fate\" is without a doubt the most inept and atrociously awful film ever made. Its poorness is so extreme that of itself it is the film's strongest selling point. The script is non-existent, the acting makes Steven Seagal look like a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the editing could have been less horrendously botched by a blind Eskimo with no arms. It is also painfully slow. This film makes might barely last 70 minutes but you will feel like you've aged ten years by the end of it. That's what makes a film truly bad: the fact that despite its overbearing weaknesses it isn't even entertaining!Many people look back at the sixties and think, with obvious resentment for today's cinematic output, that \"they don't make them like this anymore!\". Watching \"Manos...\" would cure any breed of hardcore nostalgia.In the end I can not advise against this strongly enough. This is for the masochist in you (or the sadist if you insist on showing it to friends). Any other part of your person can only feel pained or offended by such extreme trash!",

            "content": "Every so often, someone comes onto IMDb (or a similar forum) and declares that such-and-such a film is, and I quote, \"THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!!\" Usually the culprit is the latest big-budget, little-story extravaganza, or some popular work receiving its expected share of backlash. I always laugh a bit when people do this. Clearly, these innocent souls have never seen an episode of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000.\" Specifically, they have never been exposed to the horror that is \"Manos: The Hands of Fate.\" Sure, plenty of movies are bad, but usually if you look hard enough, you can see some evidence that someone on board had at least a vague idea of how to make a film work. Not \"Manos.\" There is not a single shred of competence to be found anywhere in it. It fails on every conceivable level: direction, acting, script, cinematography, sets, costumes, effects, sound, music. Throw in some of the most irritating and idiotic characters you'll ever see, a lot of disturbing sexual subtext, and the result is this pile of cinematic excrement.The story...well, I guess it's supposed to be one of those \"innocents get lost and stumble upon supernatural evil\" deals. Actually, it's more like an \"irritating family gets lost and stumbles upon a group of vague cultists and their creepy hired hand Torgo\" deal. Anyway, things happen, arguments go in circles, the mom of the family yells for her husband so much you wonder how she ties her shoes in the morning without him, the husband makes so many wrong decisions you wonder if he'd be any help with the shoe-tying thing, and the female cultists get into an extended wrestling match, revealing that under their diaphanous Grecian robes they're wearing modern bras and underwear.There's much more, of course, but \"Manos\" is like a train wreck, or a natural disaster: I could describe it to you, but you'd never understand the full level of horror unless you witness it for yourself. So go ahead, watch it, I dare you. At least you can take comfort in the knowledge that, after you've seen it, nothing else you watch will be quite so bad.",

            "content": "Upon release, Manos: The Hands of Fate swept theaters throughout the world, causing mass hysteria, panic, and power outages as theater-owners tried to keep up withe the endless demands for more power to power more projectors and sound equipment. Concerns for the general health of the world's population kept it shelved for several years, but now, finally, the greatest film of all time has been unleashed upon the public. With a score by John Coltrane and Frank Zappa (who also appears as \"The Master\"), direction by Martin Coppolla (illegitimate son of Mr. Scorses and Francis Ford...), and a script written by Stephen King (at the age of 14), Manos is as legendary as it is brilliant.Not.There really is no sense in beating this poor film into the ground any more than it already has been. What I find sort of amusing is that after a third or fourth viewing (yes, I admit it, I'm a masochist), is that it's sort of grown on me a bit. Like a fungus!Manos is about a small family of yankees who get lost in the southwestern US and end up in a place from which nobody can leave, in an Inn overseen by a twitching human-goat hybrid named Torgo (who steals the show) and owned by the enigmatic \"Master\" - a worshipper of Manos who collects wives through trapping them at his inn. I guess you can figure the rest of the film out pretty easily. This ends up being a horror film with virtually no horror, an action film with the most poorly shot action sequences I've ever seen, and an artsy jazz vehicle with such poor acoustic sound quality that it would have been much better with just the groovy soundtrack and no dialog.The biggest problem with Manos is what we call \"Production values\". To cut to the chase, there are none.There is too much wrong with this film to list it all out, so instead I will list what's right with it. The acting is not entirely awful - but the sound, editing, pacing and camera work are so bad that the actors all look totally ridiculous at all times. The script is not the worst I've seen, but it is lost in the jerks and irks of the pace (dramamine recommended), and finally, the plot is no worse than some of the recent Hollywood horror catastrophes I have seen, but it to is swept up in the maelstrom of maleficence emanating from the director's chair.The result would make a great object example for a film production class in \"what not to do\". Most people will find this film tedious, idiotic, and unwatchable. The average person, I think will turn it off after the first 5 minutes of countryside pans during the opening driving scenes.Some would argue that my rating of 2 is too high. I won't argue that point but I will explain that I reserve \"1\" for those truly aggravating films which do more harm then good, serve no purpose, and do nothing to expand the boundaries of contemporary film-makers' and cinema-goers imaginations. Most of these are commercial Hollywood romantic and sex comedies and horror films. Manos, at least, occupies an important place in film-making history, and should really be seen by would-be film-makers and participants. At least it didn't cost much to make, and at least it does no real long lasting harm. Can't say the same for, for example, \"American Pie\". For these reasons, I reserve the rating \"1\" for such truly harmful films. The distinction is best made through an analogy. If you buy a refrigerator for $3000, and it breaks down immediately upon the expiration of the warranty, that refrigerator has done you some harm. If you buy one for $300, and it does the same, you should count yourself lucky.",

Not because it's poorly done, because there are movies, like \"Monster A-Go-Go\", that are more poorly conceived, acted, directed, filmed, and edited. But \"Manos\" stands out because it is so incomprehensibly bad. It is SO bad that it is hard to imagine it was done by accident. It often seems like they film is supposed to be bad, and that the director is actually brilliantly creating a horrible film, because this kind of badness doesn't usually come from apathy or a lack of talent and money. This is worse.The film is also very icky and very dull. Almost nothing happens (certainly not anything interesting) and if you survive the first ten minutes of driving around the countryside you'll just want everyone in the film to die.However, because this movie is so brilliantly and incredibly bad, I suggest everyone watch it just to know it. Everyone should see \"Citizen Kane\" because it is the watermark for all good movies. Everyone should see \"Manos\" for the same reason. It puts all other bad movies to shame. I do suggest though, that it be watched ONLY as the MST3K version, since the team does a good job riffing the film. Even they seem to be too caught up in the film's reeking badness at times that they are just stunned, but they still do a good job. I also doubt you would find a regular version of this movie, since I doubt anyone would be crazy enough to have one.Interestingly, the guy who plays the mean, stupid, and totally useless husband wrote, directed, and produced the film, and the guy who plays \"The Master\" did the art direction. They both failed in all their work. No one in this movie has ever done anything else. Thank God.",

            "content": "There are many, many awful horror movies out there these days, especially with the dominance of DVD technology, 'direct-to-video' releases and the new Renaissance of 'microbudget' horror movies. Not since the days of the triple bill dusk-to-dawn drive in have there been so many craptastic movies clamoring for the viewer's attention.Still, even in this new era of \"Troma\" productions and legions of \"Z\" level horror movies, \"Manos\" is the champ. Sure there are worse written and directed and performed horror movies available (\"Rock And Roll Nightmare II: The Intercessor\" and \"Existo\" come to mind immediately), but \"Manos\" is special. \"Manos\" is different.\"Manos: The Hands Of Fate\" isn't so much a \"bad\" movie as it is an \"anti-movie\". Not one scene, not one shot, not one line of spoken dialog, works as cinematic entertainment. To put the metaphor another way, it isn't even that the photography, writing, costumes, etc are \"incompetent\"...it's more like the whole film was done by people who didn't seem to realize they were supposed to be making a *film* instead of an 8th grade dramatic production of \"Helter Skelter\".Again, there have been flatter performances and worse actors captured on film; Roger Corman alone is responsible for 30,000 lines of dialog that ring more false than what we hear in \"Manos\". But there is a decent, spooky film trying to get out from under the ruins of the screenplay here, and that dissonance makes the experience even worse for the viewer. For instance: the actor playing Torgo truly looks emotionally damaged, like someone you'd find on the floor of a bus station rest room, but his speeches are circular, exasperating and delivered in a shaky, badly mixed alto that makes me wish he'd just SHUT UP. There's a nasty little moment where Torgo is sacrificed so his master can create a totem device called the \"Hand Of Glory\"...but it's staged with all the panache of a salon wash-and-set. The whole movie is like that. I feel badly for the director - he obviously had a nice little Lovecraft/Derleth style horror story he wanted to tell, and some evocative Satanic ritualistic vibes he wanted to convey. But every single artistic judgment he made here - how long to hold the shots, how to pace the speech rhythms of the actors, how to stage the lingerie wrestling scene with the wives, how to mix the dubbed vocals, how to end the film...every single aspect of the film was wrong-headed and bad and irritating.Every student and connoisseur of bad horror films should see \"Manos\" and get their horizons broadened about how wrong-headed and ill-advised it is possible to be when it comes to making a film. You may see films that are technically worse, but I can guarantee than it is \"Manos\" that sticks in your memory long after you've forgotten the others.",

            "review_title": "'Manos': An Enigma of Celluloid",
            "content": "When I watch a film for the first time it is generally quite easy for me to establish an initial opinion of the film at hand. At times I will come to this very website and submit a rating of the given film or perhaps I will turn to a friend and give my thoughts of the film (which tend to be quite clear). Well, after reading quite a few extremely hyped reviews and discussions throughout the internet, I decided to try my luck and buy the alleged worst film of all time: ''Manos': The Hands of Fate'. Let it be clear that this review does not pertain to the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of the film; rather it applies to Hal P. Warren's original, cut-and-dry, El Paso-born version of the film. ''Manos': The Hands of Fate' may very well be, one of the only films of which classification is painstakingly difficult to near-impossible. The film leaves a quaint, surreal, and indecisive effect upon the viewer which is what leads to the formulation of this strange conclusion.Warren's film opens on a vacationing family traveling through El Paso, Texas. The family consists of little Debbie (Jackey Neyman), Margaret (Diane Mahree), and Mike (played by our very own Hal P. Warren). Surely enough, the travelers are soon found lost on the way to their vacation site. They eventually turn onto a long dirt road marked by a sign promising a \"Valley Lodge\". After a great deal of aimless meandering throughout the backwoods of El Paso, the vacationers come across a mysterious Lodge run by an awkward and deformed Satyr named Torgo (John Reynolds). Seeing as it is getting late, the visitors ask about staying the night only to be deterred by Torgo's ominous words \"The master would not approve.\" After some pressure from the family, Torgo folds and allows the newcomers to stay. As the visitors enter the lodge they are welcomed by a mantel full of strange hand-like pagan icons and sculptures, accompanied by a strange portrait of presumably The Master and his hound. As Michael and his wife Margaret observe the strangeness of the portrait and their surroundings, a strange howl is heard from outside in the desert. Soon strange happenings begin around this lodge of sins, as Michael and his family's fate is determined by \"the hands of fate\"To be blunt, the film is simply quite technically limited. Supposedly the film was shot entirely on one camera which was only capable of shooting 60 seconds of film at a time. To say that this hurt the film would be an untrue, if anything it helped the pacing of this little low-budget flick. Hal P. Warren was a director with literally no experience or conceived directorial abilities; he had no knowledge of pacing or camera work (if he had any it was most likely limited to home videos). The acting for the most part is quite dismal, the only exception being a wonderful character conceived by Warren named Torgo. Reynolds' portrayal of Torgo is supreme; although having no professional training or profession acting experience in cinema he creates a one of-a-kind character, which has been quite unparalleled in cult-cinema. No matter how much one hates this film, they will always remember the timid and tormented Torgo, uttering his infamous line: \"The Master would not approve.\" The music featured in the film is quite repetitive and amateur, although at times it does add to the feel, aid the pacing, and promote the overall camp-factor of the film (which was sometimes delightful). The cinematography is certainly not note-worthy, nor is the lighting. The editing seemed to have been done with haste and is one of the key factors which seems to have earned this film its reputation. One thing however, which is not widely criticized by viewers is the plot. It is a plot with great potential that was realized by Warren; at the time it would have been quite fresh. Interestingly enough, it could vaguely be seen as a blundering, early version of 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' (not to say that Tobe Hooper drew any influence from ''Manos': The Hands of Fate').Well, this is widely considered to be the downright worst of the worst \u0096 the bottom of the bottom. As stated earlier, I cannot place this film on a scale of one to ten, yet I can argue that this is a false statement. Almost every aspect of the film is done poorly, yet as odd as it sounds, the movie generates a charming and enjoyable little atmosphere; it simply does not feel like the worst one out there. There are plenty of films which are far less enjoyable to watch than Manos. Technically speaking the assumption can be made that it is the worst, but then again there are films with far more dismal lighting, far more sloppy camera work and far worse pacing. One could contend that the acting is downright dismal and corpse-like in every respect, yet there are films with worse acting and absolutely no memorable or quotable (Torgo - whether it be mocking or homage) characters. Hence, in many respects Hal Warren's single 1966 production isn't the worst piece of celluloid out there, yet at the same time it possess many, if not all of the qualities which could be attributed to the worst film of all time. However, the goal of this review was not to debunk the position in cinema history ''Manos': The Hands of Fate' has achieved, but rather to offer a little insight into what this film has to offer. In all fairness, I enjoyed it in a wonderful, campy, and surreal sort of way... after all, what other film is out there like this? What film is there that was made on possibly the lowest budget of all time, featuring the work of the most cinematically inept individuals, yet despite these obvious flaws has kept people talking about it for years to come?",

Not only is it riveting edge of your seat entertainment, it also boasts a psychological depth unequaled by any other horror movie, achieved mostly through John Reynold's Oscar-worthy, divinely subtle performance as the tormented, tragically misshapen caretaker Torgo. Part Quasimodo, part Hamlet, this gentle soul's noble end, in which he is massaged to death by a group of terrifying succubae in luscious robes, is unarguable one of the most poignant in motion picture history \u0096 it is both a tragedy and a triumph of the human spirit. Oh, was I alone with a tear in the eye at the end!Indeed, Hal Warren's masterpiece achieves the perfect balance between the heartrendingly sad, the refreshingly sardonic, and the chillingly satanic. The Master and his hellbeast are as much evil personified as Margaret is the embodiment of goodness and chastity. In a way, this is the definitive modern-day equivalent of Goethe's Faust, though even more sublime in the simple poetry of its dialogue. When Torgo describes his master as being `not dead the way you know it' and `with us always' he is speaking for all of us, how we truly live on through the memory of our words and deeds in the minds of those who follow us, be they righteous or malevolent.Hal Warran not only changed the face of the Texan film industry by encapsulating such a grand story in less than 75 minutes, it also helped usher in a whole new perspective of looking at film, discovering different forms which never would have been conceived. Also, it's obviously a very personal film for Warren, who allows us to share his love and devotion to the project, and it is a truly moving, cathartic experience.It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and maybe \u0096 just maybe \u0096 you'll learn a little bit about yourself.",

Manos is morally the true winner here in that respect.Not much can be said that has not been said already about this movie. I would know, since reading the IMDb comments, getting a load of laughs from them and feeling a complete sense of empathy with other poor souls who dared to watch this movie, knowing exactly where they are coming from, is just about the only good thing I have gotten out of MTHOF.Yes, the movie was an eyeopener. I had no idea how bad movies could be before Manos. Ed Wood movies at least provide laughs and something coherent to look at, even though the realization is shoddy to a humorous magnitude. A so-bad-it's-traumatizing movie is an entirely different league from a so-bad-it's-good movie.In Manos we basically have: driving; boredom; more driving; more boredom; a feeling of being mentally raped within the first 15 minutes (not many movies can do that, you know!); more driving; some rather purposeless necking; (did I mention the driving?); Torgo, our favorite strange person with deformed knees; a family, in whose creation Darwin's laws of natural selection seem to have been completely ignored, gladly deciding to spend the night in \"the master's\" house; a touching display of affection through holding hands (or is it?); a bored kid; a dead dog, i think; some melodramatic \"hand-waving\"; a puzzlingly out-of-the-blue all-out wrestling match amongst the ladies, thoroughly making me question my previous enjoyment in watching such activities; how massaging someone to death would look like and last, but quite least, the absolutely tasteless ending, complete with a subsequent cast introduction to give it a \"campy\" feel.

Sure, I thought, it'll be a laugh to investigate the claim that this might be the worst film ever made. Why, if its that bad, there must at least be comedy value in its awfulness? And in consolation, it is only an hour long.No, the warnings are true and serious, this is bloody terrible.After twenty minutes, I had stopped sniggering at the unimaginable ineptitude. I only realised that twenty minutes had passed when i flicked on the timer on the DVD; I honestly thought it was closer to forty-five.After forty minutes I was shifting uncomfortably in my chair and I wanted to cry.After an hour, I was submerged in despairing, pointless anger. I was angry with everyone involved in the film, angry with my cup of tea, my flat, the world, even God Himself (or Herself).You will lose faith in humanity watching this film.Imagine any conceivable measure for any possible aspect of film-making, and Manos still gets zero out of whatever. This \"film\" fails so utterly in every way, you'll wonder if anyone involved in its creation had ever seen or even heard of films or television. No, more than that, you'll wonder if they'd ever even spent a day on this planet. There isn't one single moment that you forget that these people are standing in front of a camera, ineptly executing one of the most awful scripts ever imagined.I've never been so insulted by any form of \"entertainment\". I lost count of the number of times I was beaten over the head with a totally obvious point. I lost count of the number of times completely random stuff just *happened* with no genesis or consequence. I certainly didn't lose count of the number of locations used, or the number of musical cues, you could count those on one hand, after a circular saw accident. It baffled me that they never realised that you can't shoot film at night without some form of lighting. And the music itself... oh God. I don't need to warn you about spoilers, there's plenty to complain about without resorting to inconsequential detail. Like the way that every time it cuts to the family, they're just standing, for no reason, in the same spot, waiting to talk to the camera. Like the absolutely shocking and disgraceful editing. People jump from awake to asleep and back, from one spot to another, from happy to sad, instantaneously. The awful acting... I don't know, its like everyone was given a piece of paper with some emoticons for happy, sad, scared and angry, and told to learn them off. The dialogue... well, technically it *is* dialogue, in the same way that McDonalds is food. Well, some people might enjoy McDonalds. See, I can't think of a parallel awfulness; \"Manos\" is to \"bad\" as... you can't finish that sentence.Good Lord, I could go on, and on, and on, but I won't. This film cannot warrant anything but a 1/10 on IMDb. I haven't seen any of the other bottom 100 as of today, but i'm willing to bet that they are at least a rough approximation to what we call a \"film\". This is not.Seriously, you really, really need to be in a masochistic kinda mood to see this out. I had to leave the screen timer on after 45 minutes just so I could keep reminding myself that, second by second, it *would* end. Because Hell itself might just be never-ending Manos.",

I've seen way worse films.In fact, Becca and I bonded over the fact that we share a strange adoration for this movie, which seems to exist in its own unique universe that doesn't follow the laws of man.This is a movie that was created as a bet. You read that correctly.El Paso, Texas is where Harold Warren, an insurance and fertilizer salesman, and screenwriter Stirling Silliphant - who wrote the movie version of In the Heat of the Night and, of course, Over the Top - made a bet in a coffee shop that Warren could make his own horror movie all by himself. To be fair, Warren had done some acting himself and even appeared on Silliphant's TV show Route 66.Not only did Warren make that movie, he had the scent of auteur all over himself, writing, producing and even starring in the resulting movie along with theater actors Tom Neyman and John Reynolds.Nobody in the crew had any experience making a movie. They only had $19,000 in their budget. And the result was a movie that opened to little fanfare at the Capri Theater in El Paso, where one limo drove each person one at a time, repeating the same loop, and it died except for some drive-ins in West Texas and New Mexico.If Warren had been smart enough to put a copyright on his film, the story would have ended there. But he wasn't. And he didn't. So here we are.As you can hear in the link above, Frank Conniff found Manos while looking through a box of movies for the show Mystery Science Theater 3000. The film had been playing on TV for some years - as cheap as $20 for a rental - and was available from public domain suppliers for some time. Oh you internet era readers, never having to buy films sight unseen from mail order.Conniff would go on to say that Manos \"seemed like it was maybe a crime against humanity, but you couldn't be sure\" and \"has an atmosphere, a vibe\" that made it appropriate for the show.\"While on vacation near El Paso, Texas, Michael, Margaret, their young daughter Debbie and their dog, Peppy - all dubbed like they're in an Italian movie - are looking for the Valley Lodge. They're lost and the film takes forever to find them, spending nearly nine minutes on footage of driving and a teenage couple making out and drinking.The family finally finds a house in the middle of nowhere, which is watched over by Torgo, a satyr that moves at a glacial pace for most of the film. He was played by John Reynolds, who sadly committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with a shotgun a month before the film played in his hometown. He was on LSD for most of the filming of Manos.For some reason, the family stays the night, despite the Satanic portrait of the master and his dog with glowing eyes. They even decide to stay after Peppy the dog is killed by unseen forces and Torgo begins trying to put the make on Margaret.Eventually, we meet the Master and his many brides as they sleep around a gigantic fire. They awaken and demand that Michael be sacrificed to their god named Manos. At this point, you may look up the fact that manos is Spanish for hands, meaning that the title of this film could be Hands: The Hands of Fate.While all that's happening, The Master decides to sacrifice Torgo and his first wife too. There are numerous catfights before the family escapes into the desert night, which makes no sense as this movie is both shot night for day and day for night.When we return to the house, Michael has now taken on Torgo's role and his wife and daughter now belong to The Master.Often, people talk about just how hard it is to make an HP Lovecraft film. They've probably never seen this movie, a film that has no horizon lines, that always takes place in a world where it's either too bright to be night or too dark to be daytime, as people say inane things and move strangely and women wear diaphanous gowns and men have smocks with giant red hands on them.This is a movie that promises \"A cult of weird, horrible people who gather beautiful women only to deface them with a burning hand!\" and then makes the bold statement - nay it's a command - \"No one seated the last 10 minutes! We defy you to guess the ending... and ask you not to divulge it!\"It lives up to every bit of that hyperbole.Despite the film's negative reception, Harold Warren was so proud of it that he began wearing the Master's robe every Halloween. His son now carries on the tradition. Not bad for a film where the only people who got paid were Debbie (Jackey Neyman Jones) who got a bicycle and the Doberman who got a bag of dog food. What about Peppy?",

The negative criticisms and those slamming it as the worst movie ever do not lie, Manos: The Hands of Fate is as bad as all that. There is such thing as a terrible movie that has novelty comic value, but there is also such thing as a movie that is too inept to take that into consideration. Some will disagree, but I consider Manos: The Hands of Fate as a good example of the latter. To call the way the movie is made amateurish is being too kind, the camera work and editing are all over the place and makes anything that happens incomprehensible. The visual effects are dated and make everything even more artificial than it already is, while the bizarre and often out of sync sound effects and a score that is shrill and monotonous are enough to make your ears bleed. And even when your poor ears are suffering enough, they are assaulted even more by dialogue that is stilted, insultingly cheesy and too talky and some of the worst and annoying acting ever in film history. The villain is quite possibly the most laughable and underwhelming villain ever and you'd be hard pressed to find one that is worse-acted than here. Torga is the best thing about Manos: The Hands of Fate, but that's saying nothing as he's still irritating. The direction is so flat that you have to look hard to find evidence of any direction at all, while the story is incredibly thin and is so plodding that you're dying of boredom. In conclusion, hopelessly inept. 0/10 Bethany Cox",

It's a home video that aspired to be a movie but crashed somewhere in-between, and plummeted through the abyss to depths unimaginable by the mainstream. Coherence is the film's greatest foe: bizarrity and incompetence its watchwords. This is it, bad movie buffs. This is Manos: Hands of Fate.Years ago, in the dusty desert outside El Paso, an unknown fertilizer salesman decided to craft a horror film with the assistance of friends throughout the El Paso area, and a legend was born. Armed with $19,000 dollars, a cheap 16mm camera, and absolutely no knowledge of the art of film-making whatsoever, Hal P. Warren set out upon his masterpiece.There is absolutely no redeeming quality about Manos. There is no directing, the editing appears as if it was done by a blind member of some mud-crawling insect species, the artwork is a stain upon the name of art, the script is a poorly cluttered and illogical joke masking the director's fantasies, the dialog will have you tear out your eardrums with your fingernails, and the acting is so atrocious you will feel as if the movie has violated you. It isn't as bad as Monster-a-Go-Go, but it almost manages to snatch the sorry laurels of worst movie ever made from that Lovecraftian abomination.Manos must have put good directors like Kubrick or Capra in convulsions during its production: so powerful is the elemental force of badness flowing from every stinking pore of its perverse form. It is the polar opposite to the good movie, the parameters of its illogicity and non-acting existing to defy the borders of taste, and ultimately, sanity. Every grainy, scratchy, blurry frame of the muddy color palette and every sound byte of the poorly synchronized and terribly dubbed dialog offers an entrancing glance into a deeper, darker world of madness that is Manos the Hands of Fate. It is not of this earth. It is not of our dimension. Surely Hal P. Warren was some malfeasant alien god from a realm far removed from our own, hurtling across the icy chasms of space with a vile mission in store for the unsuspecting members of the cinematic world.Its legacy, however, lives on in the form of Mystery Science Theater. The acid-tipped barbs flew fast and furiously, striking the venerable beast in its countless weak points, crafting from the chaos a comedic gem that approaches cinematic perfection stamped into the world of movies in its own stinking ichor. This is Manos: Hands of Fate. This is the purifying baptism of fire that scourges the detestable vestiges of mediocrity and normalcy from the mainstream viewer and forever makes them a member of the cult world, the world of bad movies and weirdness that cannot be imagined. It is the cornerstone, the figurehead, the mighty totem representing everything that Mystery Science Theater and the legions of bad movie sites across the Web hold dear to their hearts.Rejoice, connoisseurs of bad movies! Fall upon the dark altar of Manos to pay homage to Torgo and the Master, and forever remember the twisted legacy they wrought from the tangled celluoid! Imitate Torgo's stumbling walk and high-brained drawl, until it fuses with the very core of your being!",

The problem is not that the person is too close to the picture, and therefore cannot see the mistakes he's making. The problem is also not an inability to make necessary adjustments after stepping back to look at one's work. The problem with this film's direction is much deeper. Do not be fooled into thinking that this film was bad \"on purpose,\" because if there is a God, this cannot be true. In the history of the world, no manure salesman has decided to make a crappy (pun intended) movie for the purpose of defining \"the crappiest movie.\" No. The problem here is about the complete and utter failure of humanity. The word \"never\" had not yet been defined until this movie was \"made.\" In the end, there's no reason to consider that this movie had a director.Editing: When you were a child, you probably tried to shove two mismatched puzzle pieces together -- I admit, I've even tried this -- but you and I eventually learned that this is wrong. The editor of this film did not learn this valuable life lesson. The credits at the end of the film are the centerpieces of the editing. I only now understand that, quite possibly, editing did not occur in the production of this film.Writing: This movie despises its writer, hates him in fact. In truth, there is no reason to think that this movie was actually written. I babysat an autistic child once. Even HE couldn't have written this tripe.Acting: I understand that some people don't really get what it means to be in front of a camera. This is not the problem here. Although they have human faces and voices (all dubbed, of course), these \"actors\" are unable to even imagine themselves as being in a film. The uniqueness of their ineptitude is overwhelming at times.This is a horror flick. The actual film isn't the horror; the horror isn't even filmed in fact. The true horror is this movie's sweeping destruction of the elements of film -- direction, editing, writing, acting, etc. Even the title, which translates to \"Hands: The Hands of Fate,\" would baffle the Sphinx. I know that Duran Duran named themselves twice, but this title is something else entirely. It is a sucker punch to everything linguistic and meaningful.Why this movie took 2 and a half months to film is beyond me. This movie is 74 minutes long. There is no reason to believe that this movie took more than 74 minutes to film. After all, without a director, editor, writer, or actors, it's truly difficult for me to say that this is a film. There are those who want to find genius in such a deconstructive expression. Make no mistake, this movie is not smart, is not clever. The deepest meaning one can glean from manure is to never again step in it. If you value anything even remotely artful, you will keep yourself oblivious to this \"movie.\" This movie will scar you and shape the rest of your life, I guarantee it.",

The femto-budgeted, near-amateur production dominates the top of the bottom of the charts of 'bad movies' as it massages incompetent direction, inept filming and editing, an incoherent plot, insipid acting, soporific pacing, and cretinous script into a preposterous film known only for its awfulness. Lacking the goofy charm of typical 'bad movies', 'Manos' is watchable only as a curiosity or a 'how-not-to' instructional video for aspiring film-makers and, like most of its bottom-of-the-barrel ilk, a lot has been written about the film's provenance, myriad continuity errors, and production flaws. The movie's only redeeming factors are The Master's striking red and black hand-themed cape, shambling minion Torgo's intriguing walking stick, and the ultimate dark fate of the innocent family (in other circumstances, the final scene could have been genuinely creepy).",

The film is a low-budget mess--so cheap and so badly put together that it is not at all hyperbole to say that Ed Wood never made a film quite this bad! Sure, Wood's films were horrible, but at least they had better production values than a 32 second limit to scenes due to the cheap equipment or the use of only three people to dub all the voices in the film! Heck, compared to this mess, PLAN 9 is a Merchant-Ivory production!!The film begins with a guy getting lost with his family and refusing to ask for directions (insert own dumb husband joke here). Naturally, he arrives at a home whose caretaker is \"special\". This freaky guy talks about \"the Master won't like you staying here\" and crap like that and so what do these idiots do?! Yep, they get out and practically force themselves on this deformed halfwit. And, almost as soon as they get out of the car, the wife begins whining. You can tell she knew she was in a horror film because everything that happened sounded like it was the apocalypse. I half expected her to say something like \"They have blue curtains.... YAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" or \"Honey,.... I think the couch is going to eat us.... YAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\". I know that most of this was the problem of the dubbing, but it also looked like the lady was told to scream and act scared about everything!!Well, the film only gets worse from this terrible start. When bad things finally do come, the screaming and silliness goes into overdrive. But, as another reviewer said, so many horrible things have been said about this dreadful film that it's hardly worth heaping on the criticism. The bottom line is that I cannot think of a single film that was directed, edited, acted or filmed as badly as this one....oh, and the script was written by a Fox Terrier.

The spectacle of city-folk burrowing unknowing into uncharted realms where all their order, their civility means nought, where even sanity has made little purchase, these journeys fascinate me. So it is the case with Manos, a notorious film and one of the stranger examples of its genre. It tells of a happy family, Michael, Margaret and daughter Debbie on their way to a countryside lodge, one which may not even exist. They lose their way and end up at a mysterious domicile run by the anxious, strange walking, staff bearing Torgo, and as their tale unfolds they come to know the nature of the place and regret ever stopping there. Manos wields a strange power, and I think it comes from the way in which the fearful foundations of the plotting find their oddity echoed in the construction of the piece. The film dwells on primal fears of the unknown, of dislocation from ones usual milieu and ultimately of the break from ones one control. Whilst other films might array a number of editing tricks and a spot of meaningful dialogue to convey such fearful atmosphere Manos relies on guileless amateurism and succeeds precisely because of its lack of control. The audience knows anything can happen, that the film lacks reason and control, so the perfect conditions are established for the films effect. Which is not to say that there aren't some legitimate qualities at work here. The score mixes simple but menacing riffs with good looser moments, piano that sometimes ripples and sometimes spikes and some tensely thudding percussion, it has quite a potent presence. There are interesting images too, Torgo approaching with his staff penetrating the frame from bottom left, Torgo holding his master at bay, his staff playing back and forth in front of the Master's face, wives bound to pillars like living statues and so on. Best of all comes when the wives arise, their depiction has a playful art to it, they are something like an insane Greek chorus. Performances are decent too, Hal Warren has a perfect stolid and dull presence as Michael, Diane Mahree appropriately perturbed as Margaret, while Tom Neyman is wondrously campy yet menacing as The Master. Best of all though is John Reynolds as Torgo, his pained and fretful weirdness exerts a powerfully strange hold. Production design is simple yet weird, and the dark cinematography works well in creating a bleak, unsettled atmosphere. I guess this one has put a lot of people off since it currently holds the no. 2 spot in IMDb's bottom 100 but to me it was a real treat. It might best be called anti-art since it was made by a fertiliser salesman for a bet, but whatever its genesis I think its something of an off the wall gem with only a few moments of blatant ineptitude (like a visible clapper-board) to spoil the fun. Not for everyone, but a happy 8/10 from me.",

That's right, I liked this movie, it didn't bore me very much, and I would watch it again. You can watch the MST3K version of \"Manos\", but you'll lose a great deal of the movie and its atmosphere. Give it a try without MST3K (who also ruined \"The Brain That Wouldn't Die\", \"Revenge of the Creature\", \"Squirm\", and several other underrated classics), you just might be surprised.

As a fan of terrible movies, I bought a DVD of the original version, however I was disappointed with the high quality of this movie.Why isn't this the worst movie ever? It makes a few classic mistakes: Firstly, it's obvious from the start that this movie is utter tripe; an excellent terrible movie will start out with great promise, and dig a bottomless pit. Secondly, one actor in the film is reasonably good; an excellent terrible movie will be sure to select untalented individuals of the same caliber. Thirdly, some scenes are so terrible they are funny; an excellent terrible movie has no funny scenes, and should lead to feelings of resentment, and anger. Finally, the plot (stranded family spends the night with a cult group) is somewhat consistent; an excellent terrible movie will have no plot, forget it's plot, or jump incongruously from scene to scene. In all fairness, Manos has a number of irrelevant scenes, but the main plot is consistently maintained.Some general shortcomings of this movie: It suffers from extremely poor editing, some of the worst I've seen; Most of the movie is boring; It is not scary, this is supposed to be a horror film; The acting is poor, with the exception of Tom Neyman, who was decent; The music is repetitious.I'm afraid that I can do no better than lump this movie in the worst top 5 I've seen, which still earns it a solid 1 / 10.Movies that I consider worse than this: Ironheart (the only movie that makes me furious for wasting time watching it; overall worst movie); Glen or Glenda (excruciatingly boring; worst plot); Delta Force Commando (by far the worst acting, worst special effects); Starship (excruciatingly boring)",

Manos uniquely fails badly in almost all cinematic criteria. It's badly paced, terribly photographed, edited abysmally, acted appallingly, it has extremely limited sets, bizarrely inappropriate music and it doesn't make an awful lot of sense. It's basically a textbook example of a bad movie. And yet, it has a certain something. Despite, or perhaps because of, all the faults listed Manos remains a very strange film. Its very oddness is what makes it fascinating to watch in my opinion. The Master, and especially Torgo, are interesting characters. The latter is played by John Reynolds in a very strange performance where he constantly jitters in a most unusual way. Torgo is supposedly a satyr, except that you would be forgiven for not realizing this seeing as his goat legs are never actually shown. Only in a film as strange as Manos would this happen. Also only in a film like Manos would all actors be dubbed by only three people \u2013 two men and a woman \u2013 and this leads to some very inappropriate voices, such as the one given to the little girl. It only adds to the overall whole.Manos isn't even close to the worst film I have ever seen. Sit through the likes of The Boys in Blue, Psyched by the 4D Witch or Car 54, Where Are You? and tell me honestly do you think Manos rots the brain like those? It may be technically and artistically awful but it works as a sort of half-remembered fever dream. Terrible but quite compellingly so.

Long before there was a butler to answer the door, a footman to carry your bags, a sweaty, repulsive lech to paw your wife, or a leering peeping tom to stare in her window, there was Torgo. When Rodney Dangerfield's act was just a gleam in his eye, Torgo was writing the book on the subtle art of twitching facial muscles and uncoordinated, jerking limbs.Overpowering in his deformed knee performance, Torgo one-ups Monty Python's, silly walk sketch, with his own inimitable, oddly prancing, lurching shuffle, masterfully performed to theme music played on a cheap electronic organ stuck in an endless loop of monotonous, hypnotically repetitive rhythm left over from a looney tunes cartoon.When Torgo stumbles out of the \"Master's\" shoddy desert shack the world goes to hell for the really dense couple and child who accept his reluctant hospitality. Meanwhile, out by the \"Master's\" sacrificial alter, his bickering zombie harem girls dressed in filmy nighties and industrial strength bra and panties tumble in the sands over who is his Number One wife and who should be killed next.Tragically,Torgo falls under a soft rain of feather-weight blows about the head from the master's wives after nuzzling one of them and then trying to stake a claim to the new girl. With Torgo's knees out of the way, the master recruits the new comers into his bizarre \"hands-on\" world and repeats the sinister cycle that is, Manos, Hands of Fate.",

He made a movie that will be mentioned and even quoted for years and years by cinema fans, a movie that has earned a place in history books. His achievement cannot be understated.Let me offer my explanation on why so many people love Manos: By watching this film you become part of a psychological experiment in hypnosis.The countless landscape scenes serve as the passage to the hypnotic state one needs to be to appreciate this movie. It is only after entering this trance you will feel strangely attracted by the incoherence of the plot, the vapidness of the acting, the emptiness of the dialog, the amateurishness of the visual effects and the shallowness of the characters.And then, the large question mark after the end credits is the snap of the finger.You wake up, and only then you realize that what you have experienced brilliantly merges into creating, quite simply, the worst movie ever made.",

            "content": "Manos: The Hands of Fate, currently ranked #5 on IMDb's Bottom 100, is a rite of passage for serious fans of trashy horror movies, marking the transition from 'merely bad' to 'completely and utterly inept in every way imaginable. It's a test of fortitude that sees many fall by the wayside; however, those who do manage to go the distance can wear their achievement as a badge of pride, knowing that they have taken the very worst that z-grade horror can throw at them and survived the ordeal (albeit with possible mental scarring).The one-and-only film from Harold P. Warren, who obviously realised thereafter that film directing wasn't his fort\u00e9, Manos opens with a family driving through the desert on their way to Valley Lodge for a vacation. Unfortunately, father Michael (Harold P. Warren, proving that acting wasn't his fort\u00e9 either), his wife Margaret (Diane Adelson), and daughter Debbie (Jackey Neyman) soon find themselves lost, eventually pulling up to a strange desert hostel where they are greeted by twitchy manservant Torgo (John Reynolds), who looks like he stores bags of popcorn or cotton wool down his trousers.Torgo warns that his master (Tom Neyman) won't be happy if they stay the night, but they won't take no for an answer; their stubborn insistence puts them in serious peril, for the master is the head of a Satanic cult and he wants to add Margaret to his collection of brides.To list everything that is wrong with this film would take longer than it took me to watch it (including the times where I fell asleep and had to rewind), suffice to say that there are fewer examples of poor editing, dreary pacing, atrocious direction, woeful acting, and diabolical dubbing. Quite how Warren and company managed to mess up in all departments is one of the great mysteries of cinema, ranking right up there with the inexplicable popularity of Seth Rogen, but it has ensured the film a notoriety that means it will never be forgotten.",

            "review_title": "Manos as experimental film",
            "content": "We search for entertainment when watching movies and videos. Upon starting this DVD entitled \"Manos:The Hands of Fate\" I was immediately impressed by the sincere tackiness during the intro sequence. The inappropriate music, voice overdub and the poor color quality and graininess of the film do create an atmosphere. Perhaps the most striking first impression is the illogical use of a grown woman's voice to overdub the little girl's voice. It cuts to the heart of the production values and most importantly post production technique. The use of the adult's voice for the little girl immediately tells us that the film will be asking a lot from the audience-perhaps too much. It is beyond reason that a editor would use this technique unless as an absolute last resort. The use of this voice for dubbing the little girl's lines is way beyond our expectations of even very problematic editing. It immediately tells us there are real problems with this film. It also tells us that we are going to see and hear something which we will not see very often on video. For this reason we must continue to watch the movie. We must see how intense this technique will become. We must see what the next mistake is and how it will happen and what the film will ask us to accept next.This is one of the keys to watching \"Manos\". We want to see the mistakes, the poor editing, amateur acting errors (the actors overall were good in this film-they only made the mistakes of beginning actors) the inappropriate music and improperly timed sound edits, the incredibly long pauses and illogical cut aways.The use of a silent camera may have actually influenced the actors and directing on this movie. They may have began acting as if they were in a silent movie ( making gestures, over expression of the face was often used to communicate in silent films).The actor John Reynolds gives a most inventive, quirky and yet sincere interpretation of the Igor type character. He is actually very good in several scenes-both comic and serious. The scene where he is deciding whether to allow the family into the \"Master's\" house is very intensely acted. The First Bride also gives a good performance. She is relaxed, comfortable and yet concentrated.The filmmaker/lead actor Hal Warren gives the impression he's in a hurry to get film finished. The film ends with his image greeting the next group of visitors.There is no question that Warren was out to get the job done-the movie made. He accomplished this but in the post production it seems stopped \"putting a film together\" and truly just did a rough assembly of scenes and sound track.Unlike Herk Harvey (Carnival of Souls)who had tremendous experience in film-making, and Ed Wood Jr.(Plan 9 From Outer Space) who evidently had professionals working on his productions and post productions- Hal Warren had no funding for post nor experience.He seems to have relied on rough, haphazard and truly mistaken editing and thus cinematic storytelling. For this reason we must watch. Because after awhile of watching this movie we begin see what is happening occasionally is that our perspectives and paradigms of what is expected in film are not only being broken and disregarded; they are being smashed apart. This is a common goal of the experimental film. Although this is most assuredly not what Warren intended, he accidentally did create a film to watched and appreciated for its often illogical sights and sounds.",

First of all, I have seen far worse films and ones which are almost unwatchable(The Beast of Yucca Flats comes to my mind readily). I dig the music. The girls are appealing...all seven. The film is such a bad film that it made me laugh. None of these folks can act. The guy playing Torgo is so atrocious that he is mesmerizing. The gimpy leg, the curled lips, the \"master will not approve,\" and his quest to get him his own woman. Funny stuff. How about the family? Daddy, Margaret, and Debbie. MIchael(played by director/producer/writer Harold P. Warren looks like he just left a rotary meeting. He has no conviction in his lines, lines like, \"Get back in the house dammit!\" The dialog is abominable. The camera-work is horrific. I could go on and on. It is easy prey, so again I like the title, Torgo, the girls, and the groovy soundtrack. The film is garbage but has a following after all these years. We remember the best and the worst.

This awful movie has generated such a dazzling amount of weird anecdotes and goofs, and in that way it's actually far more entertaining than the average film. One of my personal favorite bits is the one where the cop gets out of his car to investigate, takes two steps, and then just walks back because producer/director/writer/lead Hal Warren couldn't afford more than one light. And who doesn't love the highly threatening daytime stock footage snake in a nighttime scene, or the little girl that has her lines dubbed over by an adult with a hilariously forced high-pitched voice? Or the moths, who steal most of the scenes because they can't stay away from the lighting? Or the part where Warren clearly mouths \"CUT\" to the cameraman? Or the endless night gown wrestling matches? And Torgo of course. It's a huge accomplishment to stand out as bizarre in this movie, but Torgo manages with no effort whatsoever. What a hero. This movie has its dull bits (the driving scenes are almost in real time), but it makes up for that with its ridiculously awesome bits. It's an enriching experience you'll never forget, and it even comes with a twist that's genuinely pretty clever. Recommended, and with good reason.",

            "content": "I recently watched the MST3K version of this movie, and believe it or not, it made me want to watch the original. Joel and his robots were very entertaining, of course, but I got the feeling while watching it that if they weren't there bashing it to pieces, it wouldn't be nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be. And since there's probably about five people in the world who have actually seen the original film, I doubt anyone can really argue with that.First of all, bad editing aside, the movie has an eerie, surreal atmosphere that makes it seem more like a long dream sequence than an actual movie. It's as if we're watching someone's nightmare played out on a movie screen. Whether Hal Warren intended it to be like that or not, I think it works.I also think the concept is pretty good. A family gets lost and has to stay at an insane cult leader's house, who wants to brainwash the woman and take her for one of his many wives. The ending is one of the creepiest endings to a horror movie ever (there is even a sick little hint of pedophilia). I honestly believe that with a MUCH bigger budget and better actors, this could be remade into a really good movie.Now, with that said, I must admit that \"Manos\" has one extremely funny element that is the downfall of the entire movie, and that is Torgo. What Hal Warren lacks in film-making talent he makes up for in imagination, because he has dreamed up one of the funniest characters to ever appear on film. Torgo is a stuttering, wobbling, neurotic troll of a man with an out of control sex drive. His expression when he looks in the window and watches the woman undress is classic. It also doesn't help that the way he talks is uncannily similar to Milton from \"Office Space.\" I suppose Torgo could have been scary if he was a little more aggressive, but he is such a complete loser, it is just too funny. His tragic end of being slapped to death by a bunch of women is a classic movie scene. I think if Warren had written this as a comedy, it could have won an Oscar.So all in all we have a movie that tries really, really hard, but is ruined by terrible editing and the funniest villain in history. If this had been made right, it could have been excellent, but unfortunately it has become known as the official worst movie ever. Personally, I am giving it 3 stars out of 10 for pure effort.If you watch it, watch it for Torgo.",

Filmed on a less-than-shoestring budget in my hometown of El Paso, Texas, I've had more than one run-in with this picture and I even finally acquired it on DVD. Over the years, this has been a piece that I go back to as a foundation for low-budget film anomalies.Shot in what looks like my grandfather's super 8 camera, Manos is the story of a family of three lost in a desert maze in search of a vacationing area. They end up shacking down for the night with a strange cult that worships hands or \"manos\". Memorable characters include Torgo, a spastic underling of \"the Master\"(the ashen, mustached leader of the cult), Michael,the father/husband of the family who may well be the worst actor in history aside from being the director of the film. Some highlights include a dead dog, a fight amongst chicks in togas, a crazy 1960's bebop jazz soundtrack, and a strange but smart ending.Most people who regard this movie at all have only experienced it on Mystery Science Theatre 3000.

And I've sat just loving it in Matango, Daimajin, Kaidan, and every Saturday morning on Teletubbies. However, when it comes to watching this movie it's like this, it's like taking a needle. I would have truly spontaneously combusted if the bots and Joel weren't there, tearing the movie to shreds on MST3K. The plot contians a family who has to stay at a creepy manor owned by a guy named Torgo who has the fattest thighs I've ever seen and who talks in a bizarre voice when their car breaks down. This leads to the resurrection of a satan like character named the master and his hounds of hell. This just has horrific dialogue and sound quality, grainy blury color photography, and an annoying song that accompanies the beginning and end credits, how bad does this get!

When I look at the IMDb list of the worst movies, I simply cannot explain how ANY movies could be rated worse than MTHOF, especially movies like \"Justin and Kelly\" which, though an abominable movie starring two nonentities, actually had production values, a budget, and some sort of direction. It's obvious that some of the reviewers are picking on certain movies because the plot was ludicrous, or the direction was incompetent, or they hate the stars.MTHOF, on the other hand, is the clear winner (loser?) by virtue of being awful in every possible category. This isn't a movie that failed to live up to its potential, or cast the wrong actors. No, this is a movie that shows what happens when absolutely no talent is available at any level.It is a chore to force yourself to watch this movie, but I think that all those reviewers who were apparently horrified by \"Justin and Kelly\" need to take the time to see what a really bad movie is.

            "content": "'Manos' The Hands of Fate attempted something very few filmmakers have ever done before, and un-intentionally no less- this film goes below expectations, but not just any ordinary expectations. I knew right from the get go this would be a bad movie from the reputation it's garnered here on IMDb. However this takes the cake. It ends up being more embarrassing, more horrendous, and more offensive than anything cooked up from the Ed Wood school of low-budget, horror movie-making. On top of every performance (even John Reynolds' Torgo, who does pull off that insane servant look, despite no voice to match) stinking to high heaven, every single bit of craftsmanship takes everything that was set up in the cinema world right out the window.The good news for people who wish to see it out of sheer curiosity is that it's now available from the Mystery Science Theater 3000 people (as it has been for ten years, one of it's most infamous specials). Their commentary is a plus, and just when you think it can't get any worse, it gets funny by way of them. It's hard to heckle a film. This is the prime exception. All the music, the camera shots (though, giving the benefit of the doubt, it's all shot with one camera getting 30 seconds at a time with no sound attached on location), the atmosphere, the flimsier-than-ripped-flip-flops storyline, it sets a standard that few movies can go to. Maybe that's its most impressive feat, that it takes itself so seriously as a legitimate, circa mid 60's B horror film, that it's fun just to watch and experience the depths it goes to. F+",

Since he died in 1986, he was unable to see that it now lives in infamy as a classic MST3K episode (the only way to see it). But even there I will admit having a hard time watching all of it. It felt like hours passed while watching it (kinda like at work). Most people have talked about the Torgo theme song, which I didn't catch because I was either laughing to much or not caring enough to notice it. Of course I feel bad for the three people who committed suicide over this piece of you-know-what. I heard that Hal Warren was talking to a friend when he decided to make it and felt if Hollywood could do it, so could he. Let me the one to say here that just because you can make a movie, doesn't mean you should. It could have been an interesting film and better if they had the right equipment, actors, a good director, someone to polish the screenplay, they could have made an average film. But instead we're stuck with an un-watch able piece of junk.I guess the lesson here is leaving the movie making to the professionals. I suppose the following paragraph could be considered spoiler material, but the movie will spoil the idea of watch it with out me doing it for you.The story is about some jerk, his wife and his kid on vacation when they show up at the Master's with Torgo out front. The dad wants to stay there, the wife and kid protest. He gets his way, they stay and then he wants to go, but the car won't start. Eventually a bunch of stuff happens, Torgo dies and \"Manos\" goes after the family. In the end the family is taken captive, with the dad as the new Torgo (watching the house while the Master is away) and the wife and child as his new wives.So we leave \"Manos\" The Hands of Fate, knowing that such movies as \"The Mod Squad\" and \"Battlefield Earth\" are just pretender bad movies. Manos is the worst film ever, nothing this bad had been made before nor do I see a movie this bad showing up any time soon.",

At least PLAN 9 was campy and fun to watch, in a silly sort of way--MANOS on the other hand is like watching a fly stuck in flypaper for ninety minutes: there is plenty agony, a sensation of hopelessness and a lack of direction. At least the fly has an excuse--its legs are stuck to the sticky paper.This film centers on a stupid couple, Michael (Hal Warren) and his bride Margaret (Diane Mahree), who get lost in the desert and stay at a seemingly two-room lodge operated--and I use the term loosely--by a deformed oddball named Torgo (John Reynolds). Torgo looks after a mustachioed demon-worshipping polygamist (Tom Neyman) with a bevy of bickering wives. Are they undead? Who knows. They sleep during the day, engage in mud-wrestling matches without the mud and torture people by wrinkling their jackets.STORY: $ (Wow! The script, if there even was one, should be used by all film schools as a case study for inept work. There is a scene where Diane Mahree, the mother, is unable to go on when they try to escape, yet she has a Pilates type body, while her thick-build husband and her preschool aged daughter appear like they are taking a leisurely stroll through the park. And the cops! They constantly run off this necking couple but when something actually happens--they hear gunshots at night--they step outside their patrol car, shine fifty-cent flashlights around the area, and shrug off the firing. One of the cops even says, and I quote, \"Sound travels far at night. That gunshot could have come from Mexico.\") ACTING: $ (Wow, again! Tom Neyman plays the evil demon-worshipping dude with this odd black and red robe with extreme awkwardness. He comes off more as a weird, misplaced hippy than the lead villain of a film. And his wives. When they are without dialogue they randomly shrug their shoulders or throw up their arms in disgust with blank facial expressions. John Reynolds as Torgo is unusual but not in a talented way. Hal Warren is serviceable as the husband and Diane Mahree gives it her all as the wife but it's a futile gesture. You could say she overacts but given the cast around her all Diane had to do was show up on set and she'd give a better performance than anyone else.NUDITY: None",

How can you not laugh at his clumsy groping and hilarious lechery, not to mention his gigantic, goofy prosthetic thighs?

I did not attend the WORLD PREMIERE, but I checked the newspaper listings and went on a Saturday afternoon....

The movie was worth the ticket price (probably a Dollar) but I thought I was going to see a scary movie and it turned out to be a comedy.

That is the only word to describe the editing or lack thereof. People will be standing one moment, and sitting the next. They didn't even bother making clips look similar, the movie is not smooth at all. I couldn't tell if the actors were purposely repeating this over and over, or if the editing was just so bad they forgot to take out the second line.4-Acting The acting is one of a kind. In this case, that is not a good thing. The acting is extremely forced, especially in the case of Torgo. All of the actors are incredibly phony. Torgo's repetition of his lines, the delayed reactions, and Torgo's drunk motions are simply awful. I swear at times I thought the actors were mentally retarded.When you put all of these together, and add a master with a weird cape and a black dog, you get the worst movie of all time.

            "content": "After reading all the negative hoopla surrounding the \"worst film ever\", I decided to rent \"Manos: Hands of Fate\" to see if it was really as bad as everyone says it is.And they were right. This film is absolutely atrocious. Bad films usually have a habit of having one aspect of film-making that's done horribly while all the other aspects are sub-par. Manos did everything horribly and made sure they drove the point across.But if any one aspect was more horrendous than the others in Manos, it would definitely be the cinematography/editing (if you could even call it that after \"Manos's\" creators butchered it). Hack-job isn't the word to describe it. \"Rape and torture\"-job is the word for the filming and editing. There are moments in the film where the camera would be firmly planted at some obscure place (such as the back of someone's head or not even at the actors speaking) or switch abruptly to some badly-framed object. Editing was equally horrendous, as transitions would either be completely black screens or annoying white flashes, and actors/objects/animals in the last frame would change position or pop in at the next frame.Scenes in \"Manos\" have an odd habit of having no relevance whatsoever. One re-occurring scene in particular (a viscous five-minute lip-locking session involving 2 twenty-somethings and a bottle of cough syrup...err I mean whiskey) served no purpose whatsoever except to add more characters to a story which already had too many characters with 4 mains. Add to this ten minutes of driving through non-descriptive fields with soft jazz (bad jazz at that) in background, another five minutes of women in translucent nightgowns wrestling, three minutes of one of the women groping and nuzzling the Husband, 2 minutes of Torgo (the huge-kneed, mysteriously twitching servant to the \"Master\") nuzzling a sleeping women, and some more scenes where the characters stand in absolute silence waiting for the next cue, and you've got a movie with at least 50 minutes of filler.Writing is well... nonexistent. The writer seemed to take clich\u00e9 lines, then copy and past them on every other line. Seriously, a good 60% of the film's dialogue is one corny phrase repeated after another.And there is no plot. To say that the plot is clich\u00e9 is incorrect; the plot cannot be clich\u00e9 because the plot does not exist. In place of even a poorly scripted plot, there is a assortment of random events, each more logically absurd than the next. Plot-lines also have a tendency to pop-out of nowhere and leave just as quickly (which is surprising, given that a five year old could comprehend the basic premise of such a simple story). The characters that make up this jumble are less than cardboard cut-outs (To be cardboard cut-outs is a phrase that suggests that characters are clich\u00e9 and fit into a nice niche completely lacking originality or complexity); No characters exist. People are merely there quoting atrocious writing (acting isn't even the proper word; more than once I caught the wife attempting with every fiber of her being not to look directly into the camera). The only exception to this is the misshapen, Parkinson's Disease-afflicted Torgo, which comfortably plops into the monstrous-servant roll (I mean, come on, they might have well given him a humpback and put him in a castle with a mad scientist).The sound in \"Manos\" is terrible at best. The background music sounds like the creators took the tracks they play at supermarkets and mixed it with every other horrid B-Movie of the 1950s-60s. Sound effects and dialogue had to dubbed in later as the camera the creators filmed with could not record sound, and as a result almost every piece of noise or sound in the film is about a second and a half late.So, in short, if you decide to take the plunge, at least do it with the MST3K crew by your side and laughing all the way (even then you might not make it to the end of \"Manos\", I didn't).Technically, in everyway, this is the Worst Movie Ever. Are there or have there been worse? Probably. Have any of them made it to distribution in theaters? Probably not. And yet, there have been movies I've seen that I've disliked much more than this. Don't see \"Manos\" looking for... well anything. You won't find it. Just expect to laugh until your gut hurts or your mind melts from the sheer crappiness.",

It's hard to ignore that what's on the screen is bad, not because there's silhouettes of a guy and a couple of robots making fun of it but because of the sheer, relentless amateurishness of the film. Out-of-focus shots, long pointless silent scenes, women wrestling in togas, moths bumping into the lighting, and a stupid two-set horror play with a depressing ending. What's wrong with having someone talk over that? Would you deny morphine to a gunshot victim?The only things I thought okay were the music, which was pretty fair dinner jazz, and the actress playing the young wife, who couldn't act but was beautiful to look at. Also, there's a bit where the Master's half-dozen wives awake from their ageless slumber and start to talking all at once. The camera cuts to the Master, and I'll give the director the benefit of the doubt and assume that look of put-upon henpeckitude on his face was intentional comedy. But there is nothing else worth discussing here.A lot of times, bad films are fun to watch because they are so supremely silly and full-of-themselves they become perversely entertaining. \"Manos\" is just harsh and ugly. Joel Hodgson, the MST3K ringleader, says at one point: \"Every frame looks like the last known photograph,\" and it's true. What's on screen are talentless people who are obviously miserable about what they are doing. Poor Torgo went and killed himself shortly after completing his role, and he may not have been the only one according to the info on this site. It's painfully to watch films like this and feel like you are a party to someone's endless torment.So I maintain watching this with MST3K is not only preferable but necessary. As the little girl in this movie said later to interviewer Richard Brandt, \"without their commentary, it would be painful to watch.\" Well, hold up there, sweetiepie. Let's just say \"more painful.\"",

It's on the top of IMDB's Bottom 100, many name it as ''the worst movie of all time'', and it was even riffed on MST3K by Joel and the Bots. And yes, it's horrible as everyone said. And not in the sense ''so bad it's so funny''. NO!!! This movie is so poorly made that is a chore to watch it until the end.The plot, if anyone cares, is about a family that gets lost in the desert and end in a home that at night becomes a underground devil-worshiping cult, led by the Master and the caretaker Torgo. And horrid things start; Torgo likes the woman of the family, the Master's wives start bickering, and Torgo gets killed just by burnign his hand (!!!)''Manos The Hands of Fate'' is a movie that caused me pain watching it. The other time I felt ill watching a movie and it was fault of the movie was when I watched the FRED movies with Lucas Cruickshank. And everything in the movie is very hideous: the filming is sloppy and some scenes seemed lasting an eternity! The music... ughh. It was very creepy, monotonous, badly made and disturbing. And the acting is the worst I ever saw in a B-movie, I mean, worst than the other movies featured on MST3K. Hey, they look like Oscar-worthy movies compared to this! And the script was written in a room full of mandrills.So, inept and horrid in every way you look at it. I recommend this movie to NOBODY. Neither humans, dogs, pigeons, baboons or parrots - NOBODY! Even them would find the movie very painful to watch.",

Inside is a deformed man named Torgo (John Reynolds) who says the family can stay but soon they begin to regret that and especially once Master (Tom Neyman) shows up and wants to add another wife to his collection.For three decades Edward D. Wood's PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE was the \"bad\" movie that everyone wanted to hail and worship as some sort of champion of bad movies. Then, about five or so years ago, this one here started to gain momentum from fans who wanted to crown it the king of awful movies. The movie even got a huge online campaign to have the print remastered so now fans of this disaster can enjoy it in a great looking version or at least compared to what has previously been out there.Is MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE the worst movie ever made? I guess it depends on how you look at it. I personally look at a movie like this as something that was made by non-professional people with little to no talent and little to no knowledge of what they were doing. We know the technical issues like the camera used and how the audio was destroyed, which forced them into some horrendous dubbing. So, with all of that said, it is the worst? I personally think talented filmmakers with large budgets who turn out poor films should be looked down upon much more than what is here.With that said, there's no question this is one of the worst ever made but it remains slightly entertaining thanks to how bad it is. The music score is without question the worst thing about the picture as it's never fitting to what is actually on the screen and this is especially true early on when we first meet Torgo. I mean, Torgo is meant to be menacing or scary so why on Earth put circus music behind him? The performances are all rather poor and the dubbing here is among the worst you're ever going to hear and especially the young child who sounds like an eighty-year-old woman. Poor editing. Poor cinematography. Poor humor. You get the idea. The most shocking thing about how bad this movie is is that there's never even an attempt to make what you're watching scary.MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE deserves its reputation as one of the worst films ever made but who can resist the charm of the film, its backstory or The Master?",

Peppy disappears and Debbie finds The Master's dog. The Master and his bickering wives awaken.This is horrible filmmaking. Filmmaker Harold P. Warren is also the star playing Michael. He's not an actual filmmaker but rather a fertilizer salesman. Supposedly, he made this on a bet. Warren is impossibly incompetent in his filmmaking. The list is too long. The acting is bad but it's made infinitely worst with terrible voice dubbing. It's something one has to see to believe. All of it is horrible. The worst and possibly the best is John Reynolds who plays Torgo. Again seeing is believing although he is also rumored to be constantly on acid. The whole thing is a mess but some of it is so unbelievably bad that it's actually funny. The catfighting wives is so stupid that I cannot stop shaking my head in disbelief and I hope they kept that handy cape.

This wretched Satanic themed horror film deals with father, mother and little girl who are on vacation and turn off on the wrong road. John Reynolds is an Igor like creature who allows them to stay the night at his master's residence, indicating that Neyman is some sort of undead creature. He's also got an abundance of wives who fight at the drop of a wisecrack, and horribly annoying eerie music takes over when the writer runs out of idiotic things for the characters to say. I just wish I knew where I could get a giant over-sized robe with two huge hands over the front of it. At first while watching this, I immediately thought of that scene in the Tim Burton movie \"Ed Wood\" where a Paramount employee is viewing \"Glen or Glenda\" and begins to think it's some sort of practical joke. But like that poor sap locked in front of a movie screen for just over an hour, it began to occur to me that whoever wrote this tripe and whoever casted it, directed it, edited it (which it needed more of) and scored it truly needed psychiatric help. There are hints of several characters being tortured, but unless somebody can be slapped to death, I don't think it would really work. The one scene that is remotely scary is when Reynolds finally gets his come-uppance, but for the most part, this is just a lot of talk about who is going to die, who will be tortured, who will be freed, and who will win the Razzy for worst acting of the year. Spare yourself the torture and avoid, or as Frank-N-Furter's castle in \"Rocky Horror\" warns, \"Enter at your own risk!\"",

Yes, it is and maybe even worse.What makes \"Manos, the Hands of Fate\" a bad movie is that it was made with no talent or imagination, quite sad to watch really. I don't know what is the worst; The acting, the script, the sets, the editing. The most likely answer is that it's all just simply plain bad. Especially the editing is the worst I have ever seen. Some scene's seem to be endless while nothing is shown at it at all and most of the time they don't even have anything to do with the movie. The movie is full with this long endless shots that are really about nothing, very boring to say the least.The story is just laughable bad, if you asked me what it is about I think I can not even explain it. It's just about nothing and lot's of it makes no sense at all. It feels like someone is poking you in the brains with a stick. The movie is full with silly moments that makes you think; What the **** is that?The actors are by far some of the worst ever. They show absolutely no talent or what so ever.Then we come to the only good thing about the movie: Torgo. Oh boy what a character! I doubt it was intentional but this guy is absolutely hilarious with his strange ticks and movements. He alone makes this movie still watchable. He is a real classic.I also must admit that I liked the ending a lot. I even found it surprising and shocking but a good ending can't save a bad movie.Congratulations Hal Warren, you created one of the very worst movies of all time, you make an Ed Wood movie seem like a masterpiece.A must see for bad movie lovers.1/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

The plot follows a family driving through the country in some backwoods area. They are apparently going on a vacation, but who vacations in the middle of nowhere. Apparently they are headed to the Valley Lodge which is such a popular place that there is only one sign directing the way. Somewhere they get lost along the way and end up at Torgo's place where he is housesitting for the master. Nothing in the world indicates that this is a hotel, yet the father insists Torgo a man with an obvious disability carry the luggage back and forth. The family's dog gets killed right after they get there and it is to bad, the dog was the best actor in the film. Somehow the parents lose their daughter after this as they have their back turned and she exits the room. They find the daughter outside and she leads them to the dreaded Master, who is apparently lying on rocks outside with his many wives (what happens when it rains?). After a while Torgo is killed by the master for doing naughty things to his immobile wives and the family runs into the desert where the little girl is getting so bored with this movie she stomps on a plant while the mother is crying and doing her scene. The father promptly gives away their position by shooting at stock footage of a rattlesnake. It ends with two gals heading to the popular Valley lodge and the father is the Master's new housekeeper and the mother and daughter enter the master's Harem (sick, eh?).

Torgo to his credit told the couple to stay away from the house because his Master don't want anyone there. But Michael and Margaret just ignored him and made themselves at home and even had Torgo help them move in. Torgo looked like he was recovering from a really bad LSD trip and when you saw him walk he would sway from side to side with his legs looking like they were suffering from a very severe case of elephantiasis. The Master, who has a striking resemblance to Frank Zappa, was at the time asleep, in a zombie-like trance, in his tomb with his six wives located somewhere outside the house. Torgo was very angry at the Master for having six wives while he had none and had his eye on the nice looking Margaret for his future mate. We see Torgo later trying to grope Margaret but his actions are so weird that it really looks like he just wanted to hold on to her in order for him not to lose his balance and fall on his face ending up breaking his head. When the Master finally awakes he finds Torgo out cold as if he were a corpse and after bringing him back to life he berates him for letting the strangers into his home. The Master also accuses Torgo of fooling around with his wives while he, as well as they, was asleep in the tomb. Later that night the Master gets the whole crazy crew together and the wives become enraged over Torgo letting Michael and the two women, Margaret and her little daughter Debbie into the house and want to have them all killed. But the Master's first wife only wants to have Michael killed and have the women, especially little Debbie, left alive. A fight breaks out between the wives over who should live and who should die of the three strangers but the Master settles to only kill Torgo for letting them in the house in the first place. Having Torgo tied down the Master then orders his wives to beat him to death. But it looks more like they were giving Torgo a total body massages instead of beating him and Torgo looked like he was really enjoying all of it. The Master then has Torgo's left hand blown off by touching some magic staff that he has and we then see Torgo, minus his left hand, running into the darkness never to be seen again in the movie. Having his #1 wife tied to a poll for talking back to him the Master then proceeds to beat her to death. But the beating, like the one that Torgo got from the Master's wives,looked so harmless and phony that his wife must have died from laughing herself to death instead of the beating that the Master gave her. Meanwhile back at the house Michael and Margaret and little Debbie make a run for freedom in he dark desert but are caught by the Master and his wives before they get too far away. The movie ends with Michael replacing Torgo as the Master's care-taker and both Margaret and Debbie becoming his two new wives replacing wife #1; Or let's just say two for the price of one if thats what it all meant? What can be said about this movie that hasn't been said already. The two things I can add of what I noticed about \"Manos the hands of fate\" is that it was shot in color which was rare for a super low-budget, $20,000.00, film like it was back in 1966. As for the syrupy soundtrack it sounded like a music for a romantic or love story type film not the horrible horror movie that \"Manos\" was and is.",

There are conceptually bad films that should never have made it out of the meeting room (Emoji Movie, Jack and Jill). Those with ridiculously bad effects and painful visuals (Birdemic, Foodfight). Obvious ripoffs seemingly made for tax avoidance schemes (Little Panda Fighter, Ratatoing). Films that have manipulative and destructive messages, those with legal controversies around its production... the list goes on.Each of the films above and more are as deserving of the crown as Manos in their own rights. However, if one has to make the decision on one definitive \"worst movie of all time\", I will confidently name Manos: The Hands of Fate.The fact that Manos is none of those things is what makes the difference. It's not a conceptually bad film as the premise itself is just a standard horror film. While the production design is awful, it's not at the point of being as actively painful as the films listed above. Manos is not a ripoff of anything, doesn't promote a particularly bad message or have a major controversy around its production (though there were definitely issues with it).Manos is not bad due to any reason aside from the fact that it is simply bad. Bad in every single way. It undermines all of conventional filmmaking by ignoring plot, structure, continuity, development, plausibility, verisimilitude and countless other similarly insignificant details. Even Jack and Jill and the Room has very rudimentary levels of such basic film fundamentals. Only the Neil Breen films could compete with their incoherence and incompetence.Of course, one could always name a worse film if one delves into the most obscure, low budget productions. The Neil Breen films mentioned above are definitely on a comparable level after all. But notoriety is a significant contributor of being the worst film, for if nobody had seen and suffered through it, does it really matter at all? All in all, Manos: The Hands of Fate has a perfect balance of painful incompetence and cult reputation, earning it the crown of the worst film ever made.",

Just once! And everything would have been fine.It's all her imagination!?I'm not sure who's trippin harder...Targo the hillbilly tweaker?...or this dude?...Of course, by the time he grows half a brain and gets some sense...their car has broken down...despite running perfectly fine only moments before.Then he's a total a-hole to the guy who is quite liable to murder them in their sleep, so that he can keep his wife as his slave.And gets so distracted that his daughter just wanders off into the desert that just consumed their poor puppy.Luckily for him, she wanders back with a doberman...saying she got it from \"a dark place\" \"with lots of fun people\".These \"fun people\" happen to be \"the master\" and his six wives, who are stuck in some deep trance-like sleep.Apparently Targo the tweaker only sticks around because he dreams of having one of his master's wives...though, now he'd prefer this dude's wife instead.Quite predictably, he attacks the dude, and binds him to a tree, just as his master and his wives are awakening to the darkness of the night.He's not Manos, himself, however.Rather, a priest of Manos, who seeks to bring eternal darkness to the world in Manos' name.Meanwhile, his wives are upset about a female child being brought into their realm.Most want to kill it, so they can initiate her mother into their harem, as their master's newest wife.So there is infighting between them, as the newer ones receive more attention than the older ones.And as some of the older wives argue in defense of the child.Eventually the dude escapes his bindings, and his family makes a half assed break for it...before inexplicably returning to this house of horrors.Ultimately leading to the absolutely stupid conclusion of the film.Literally nothing in the plot of this film makes any sense.The acting is bad.And the voiceovers are worse.The soundtrack is overbearing.And the camerawork is mediocre at best.I'm honestly confused how any of this came to fruition.Or why someone thought that releasing this was a good idea.Let alone how it spawned an NES game.It all really makes Birdemic look like a masterpiece.One of the worst horror films I've ever seen, for sure.1.5 out of 10.",

It's the ultimate test for Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fans at how strong their tolerance level for Z movie garbage is. This uniquely inept film really is a challenge to sit through, even with the Bots hammering it with some of the best riffs of their career. Where \"Night of the Living Dead\" proved a great horror movie could be made on a shoestring budget; Manos proves exactly the opposite.The film opens with an excruciatingly drawn out road trip of bland scenery. There's a couple in a sports car making out every time you see them, and two cops with nothing much to do except constantly annoy the couple. Neither cops nor couple have anything whatsoever to do with the plot (if there is a plot, that is). The grainy film is obviously cheap Super 8 that the director Hal Warren, the auteur behind this, bought at a dime store somewhere, all dialogue is poorly dubbed by the same three people, and the acting defies description by any adjective in the English vocabulary.You must see Torgo. It is the Master's will. You must see Torgo. He has obtrusively huge knees, a deteriorating hat, goes through odd muscular convulsions when he's about to talk, mumbles and stutters, and always repeats phrases twice in a speech. The family's first encounter with Torgo is probably about 30 seconds worth of information, and runs about 3 hours. Rivalling Torgo are the Wives, and their Battle Royale pillow fight, so funny it's painful. Because of them, Torgo, and the laughs this movie offers, this ponderous work of art staggers into a 2 rating. The Master would approve. Only MST3K would dare unleash this upon an unsuspecting world. The Master would approve.",

At the end of the day, even with all the unintentional humour, the film is an arduous experience. It's just not engaging.

Since it is instead bizarrely unique awful, I have to give it ten stars. It really is an achievement of sorts.

            "content": "Obviously, given that this has been voted 'The worst film of all time' by IMDb users I knew it wasn't going to be good, but after acquiring a copy of this movie I set out to find out how bad it really is. After what seemed like a day of watching this film, I'm fairly certain that I'm never going to fully recover from the experience - it's left a physical stain on my minds eye which I doubt could be removed by a surgeon.Let me make a few things clear at this point. Not only is this the overall worst film of all time, but it's without question the 'worst made' film I've ever experienced, the cutting of scenes must have been done by someone with a terrible mental illness, although saying that, at least some of the scenes are actually edited, unlike the classic moment where they drive past a sign to the 'valley lodge' and the camera stays on the sign for a full minute. (although it actually feels like an hour)At this point you expect the film to cut to the innards of the valley lodge, but no, there's just more driving around with the camera shaking and half zoomed in on the horizon. This movie feels like it was made by a child, and the acting doesn't help, it's appalling, but even that is overshadowed by the horrific, nay painful use of music.Then we meet Torgo, who looks p***ed, constantly wobbles like a weeble, twitches like a freak and has the knees of an elephant. There's simply nothing scary about him, so he gets his own theme, whenever he's on screen (or partly in screen due to the editing) there's some cheap keyboard music which I *think* is meant to be frightening. Like the scene when he carries their luggage into the house, shaking a wobbling as only he can do - why would this need scary music, it's not a scary scene, if you're scared by a freak carrying luggage then I truly pity you.Anyway, in summary, don't think that it's so bad it'll be entertaining, because it isn't (if you want something like that, try 'Cool as Ice', or possibly 'Crash') It's horrific to the point of disbelief, whilst remaining incredibly dull throughout and the pace of the thing truly beggars belief. Dreadful, ghastly, wanton and messy at the same time.",

Which is legendarily bad.And yet I'm unable to give it a lower score than I did. Because this film brings me joy. I think that from now on, whenever someone talks about \"so bad it's good\" movies, this will be my personal go-to film.Because this film is bad. The camera work and editing are amateurish, either holding the shots too long, lingering where not needed or just jumping around too much. The acting is hokey and banal for the most part, with some glorious exceptions, but we'll get to those in a moment. The plot is derivative of all the known cultist slash vampire movies there is, but tied to the cheapest location they could get, while at the same time not even working in either of those genres.But it's also so good. The lines of dialogue are pure Gorgonzola and the best of them are delivered by two of the best characters. First of them is the Master (Tom Neyman), who seems utterly incapable of deciding whether he stars in a less than subtle satire parody or Shakespearean drama. Either way his delivery of his typical cult leader lines of dialogue is completely over the top.And then there's Torgo (John Reynolds), the Master's dimwitted henchman. Torgo is hands down the best thing about this film. I have no idea what kind of directions he was given in regards to his character, but whatever they were, Reynolds took them and cranked the dial to twelve. I suppose he's trying for spooky mentally ill hillbilly. But he does it so over the top and so jarringly that it goes the full circle around and lands in adorable.Look, it's a bad film. Definitely a film that would be so much worse if watched alone and sober. But, in the right frame of mind, with the right friends, it can be one of the most memorable movie watching experiences you'll ever have. Try it out.",

A bland couple and their daughter get lost on their way to a vacation spot and end up spending the night at a creepy, run-down shack owned by \"The Master.\"  Handyman Torgo tries to talk them out of it, but the huge, loudmouth jerk of a husband insists despite the protests of his wife.  The dog gets killed, Torgo tries to feel up the wife and little Debbie the daughter stumbles across the resting place of The Master, his wives and a very large Doberman.This is the STUPIDEST movie I've ever seen.  The husband (aka The Director of this crap fest) is a complete jerk who spends the entire film griping and barking at his wife and daughter.  The wife is a vapid dingbat who, after having been fondled by Torgo, decides to strip down to her underwear in front of the wide open window.  And Torgo twitches, mutters, slobbers, leers and stumbles through the whole film, waddling around like a giant toddler with his oversized kneecaps.  (Actually, I had heard somewhere that Torgo was supposed to be a satyr, but since he always has his pants on and we never see the trademark goat legs, just what the heck was the point?)  The Master looks like Snidley Whiplash and his superpowers seem to consist of staring very hard and laughing maniacally.  His name and title also make no sense: Manos means \"Hands\" so what kind of fear is \"Hands, the Hands of Fate\" supposed to instill in me?Cheap, badly lit, horrible repetitive dialogue and wooden performances make this one of the worst movies of all time.  Legend has it that three of the actors apparently killed themselves within months of this films release. I can't say for sure if it was the mortification that drove them to it, but it couldn't have helped much.The moral to the story is: never let a fertilizer salesman make a movie.",

I'm off to Arby's....*********** *********** *********** *********** *********** *********** ***********Manos: The Hands of Fate, one cinema's best known and most beloved bad movies. It's by-product-on-celluloid created from the singular mind of a certain fertilizer salesman from El Paso, namely: Hal P. Warren. How old Hal thought he had the knowledge and ability to make a movie (that people would actually want to/pay to see) is anyone's guess, but he did try and I'm very,very glad he did; because Manos: The Hands of Fate is, indisputably, one of the pinnacle of achievements of crap-cinema.A man with a vision! Hal P. Warren, a man of many talents, not only sold fertilizer, but also wrote the script, served as director and \"starred\" in his own movie, in the role of \"Michael\" clad throughout the film in a hip white cardigan, combined with one of the wickedest widow peaks ever seen in a movie. Then there's his wife \"Margaret\".....does anyone hold the same opinion that she sets a new level for on-screen patheticness? Because she can't do ANYTHING without, crying and whining, falling down or repetitively yelling \"Mike! Mike!, where in the world could he be, Mike!\". I challenge anyone to find a character in a movie who's less capable then her. Then there's the couples, 5 year-old daughter \"Debbie\", who like all other characters, had her dialog dubbed in after filming, except for her they chose a middle-aged women to do her lines - with less than convincing results. It sounds like she's channeling the voice of her dead grandma some have said, it's certainly a somewhat creepy and unnatural sounding voice. And let us not to forget their little black dog \"Peppy\". Does anyone really not yet know the plot of this movie? The plot is so pointless - so it's pointless to talk about it. Things really get interesting when Torgo shows up, \"I am Tor-go, I take care of the place, while the mas-ter is away!\". He functions as the motels caretaker, a rather short, bearded, quirky fellow with big, puffy, highly abnormal knee's and is always carrying a staff, presumably to help him maintain his balance as he slowly and awkwardly shambles to and fro. Torgo is propelled forward by \"The Haunting Torgo Theme\" an exceptionally catchy and charming little ditty, consisting of a repeating 3-note keyboard pattern, a pulsing bass drum and crystallized with tinkling xylophone. Torgo has a highly memorable introductory scene, with some funny dialog, which is often repetitive and contradictory - his opening line is a one of the all-time greats. Without a doubt Torgo is one of the oddest and quirkiest characters ever depicted in any movie. The actor who played Torgo, was the doomed 25 year-old John Reynolds Jr., who was reportedly very depressed and on drugs when filming the movie, to further make life miserable for him, the rigging that he wore under his pant-legs was unknowingly worn wrong and caused him to have chronicle knee pain. He killed himself with a gunshot to the head on October 16th 1966, about three weeks before Manos' world premiere in El Paso Texas, which occurred on November 5th 1966, a highly laughable, budget-restricted event (just like the movie itself) from what I've read. Torgo has several great scenes, watch and be rewarded.Then there's The Master.....Torgo's boss, along with his six wives, who apparently hang out in the desert and sleep during the day. I've always loved The Master's awesome robe, it's jet-black with gigantic bright red hands, with splayed fingers, one hand on each side (purportedly, Hal P. Warren kept the robe after filming and for years afterward wore it on Halloween night when greeting the trick-or-treater's - THAT ROBE should definitely be in some sort of movie museum) and it simply looks spectacular when The Master raises his arms when he prays to Manos, which happens frequently. Played by actor Tom Neuman, who pretty much has the perfect look happening for this role, especially his great villainous mustache. His lunatic rantings and raving are even more ridiculous and repetitive then Torgo's. Then there's The Master's six wives, dressed in all white, partially see-through gown's of some sort, which you THINK would look sexy, but I assure they do NOT look sexy, these six harpies's proceed to bicker at each other and get into cat-fights in the night, some of that cattiness is eventually directed at Torgo. The plot of this movie was an afterthought, but they had to give the ladies something to do. They proceed to clumsily (that word is particularly apt for Torgo) harass Mike and his family in and around the motel at night, apparently there's an undead angle to their existence, because they're solely nocturnal.Primitively filmed, by an assortment of novices and semi-pros 50 years ago, on 16mm film, with a camera that was unable to record sound, the end result, not surprisingly is pretty wretched looking to say the least and the editing in this movie is among the very worst ever seen. Though it has, within the past several years been restored and thankfully, from a visual standpoint greatly improved. Reportedly Hal P. Warren had a real short-fuse, did a lot of yelling and was hated by his entire cast and crew. Also there's the fact that Hal was so ignorant about film-making, that his cinematographer said that he often feed him lines such as \"We'll fix it in the lab.\" which was pure BS, just to speed up production, Hal must have been hell to work with. But I must say I wish the man had made more movies, he could have been the next Ed Wood, but sadly that never happened and Manos: The Hands of Fate remains the one and only Hal P. Warren production......................................................but the guy sure could sell some fertilizer, couldn't he??!!",

The direction of Hal Warren is amazing, and ranks at the top with other grand master visualists such as Kurosawa, Fellini, Bergman, Truffaut, Scorsese, Kubrick, Michael Bay and McG.The acting is compelling. John Reynolds perfectly embodies the deformed \"Torgo.\" Hal Warren display similarly impressive skills in _front_ of the camera as Michael, the dense man who, after being told \"The Master will not be happy\" about his family's presence at a creepy old mansion run by a weirdo who can barely walk, tells his wife she is \"imagining things\" when Torgo tells her that the Master likes her, and is dead, but not dead the way they are familiar with.The screenplay is superb. Realistic dialogue flows like cheap champagne at one of Paris Hilton's parties. I also particularly loved the Bergman-style shots of nothing-ness -- for example, the opening, which is a ten minute montage of mid-west scenery. Kubrick would be jealous.I also loved how all the conversation takes place through facial expressions. When Michael and Normal American Family first meet Torgo, no exchange of dialogue takes place for over thirty seconds. At first, I thought it was just due to Hal Warren being a totally incompetent director with very poor editing skills. But later, I realized it was all in the gestures of Torgo's face, as he stares at them with icy emotion. He's translating a message: \"I'm here, I'm Torgo, I'm sad and lonely.\" What a beautiful, poetic and truly moving scene. It made me cry, Warren has transcended the genre here - this ranks in the top class of all films of the past century - forget \"Citizen Kane,\" forget \"Seven Samurai,\" forget \"Pearl Harbor.\" This is the best movie ever made, and if you disagree, you're probably just stupid and ignorant.",

The only thing scary about this movie is the fact that time and money were actually spent in making it. Good thing Hal Warren stuck with his day job.",

Even a five year old could see this was a stinker.The first to realize this film, or whatever it is classified as, was a bomb, were the musicians who scored it. The music is pitifully poor quality throughout. It must have been the only way for the horn players to keep their dignity intact, by trying to match the movie's rock bottom status with something that sounds atrocious. They were successful in reaching a depth of screechiness and an end song with lyrics that sought and found zero listenability.I want to say something nice about the movie. The two 35 year old teen-agers necking in the car were not as bad as the deputies who mimed interest in gunfire at night in the desert. The catfight scene made other scenes in the movie seem better by comparison.Do you suppose a real script of this exists today or ever existed? If there was a script would someone have saved it for some reason? Do you think there were any rewrites to the original story that might actually have been worse? Who was the doberman's agent? What did he have against dogs? Look at the sofa where the little girl sleeps. What are those garbage stains?

Oh, my gosh!! This was one unspeakably horrible movie. And I even tried to tune out Joel, Servo, and Crow to get an untainted opinion, or at least a less tainted one. I couldn't bear it. The movie was just so badly made and had no redeeming values to push it past its low budget. Wouldn't you think that, when people dub voices for characters, the voices should sound kind of distinct, even if the same actor is playing them? Voiceover actors on cartoon shows (good ones, at least) do it all the time. Yet, we can tell quite well that the same actor is playing the dad and the cop in the exciting broken taillight scene. The only difference between the two is that the cop has a bad Southern accent. And wouldn't you think that, if the movie went on for several minutes without dialogue, there should be some action to fill in those gaps, or at least something exciting? Not in this movie. Much of the first half of the movie consists of driving through fields. Also, aren't characters put in movies to advance the action of said movies? Ask the kissing couple that keeps getting chewed out by the cops. Well, as you can see by my extensive ranting, I really, really didn't like this movie. The grim trivia that I learned about several of the actors didn't help at all. I finally had to break down and listen to the commentary to get some laughs out of it. I'd recommend that you do the same.P.S.: I'm sorry if a lot of the stuff I wrote here sounds like what's been written before, but it's the stuff that really pops out at you when you see it, seeing how there's nothing really frightening in this movie.",

It seems that the director has tried to build up suspense with long pauses in the conversation (seriously, you could grab a quick cup of coffee in any given pause), and lots of \"creepy\" piano music. It doesn't work.And when the evil Master is finally revealed little more than half way in to the movie, it turns out to be a pale man with a fantastic mustache, dressed in a black and red robe, with a (not particularly fierce) dog at his side; and his collection of wives, not so scary.The real star of the movie though, is caretaker Torgo, a somewhat menacing yet pathetic evil henchman stereotype who moves spasmodically and talks with a stutter.

I found myself wondering what the \"uncut\" version had been like (the MST DVD did not come with the \"original\" version of the movie, like many MST DVDs do.) I finally broke down and bought the unMSTed DVD on Amazon, just to see the \"unedited\" version. (I'll say this, the MST version was actually in better, less crackly shape.) Yes, the original \"Manos\" is still slow-moving, with endless shots of countryside that serve no purpose. Yes, the acting is atrocious. Yes, there's continuity holes galore (When exactly is the Master going to actually kill Torgo, anyway??). These are all things that can also be said about the original \"Carnival Of Souls\", which is (rightly) considered a classic camp/horror masterpiece.The characters of the Master and Torgo are two of the most widely laughed at in film history, but they're also the best performances in this film. Tom Neyman as the Master is honestly evil-looking and scary, especially in the couple of scenes they cut out for the MST version. The late John Reynolds' spazzy performance as Torgo can only half be attributed to the drugs he was allegedly on at the time; the guy was either a for-real mental case, or he was damn good at acting like one. Director/Father Harold P. Warren voiced all the male characters in the widely-razzed voice-over-- and I happen to think he did a rather good job. Sure, they all sound alike-- but only a little bit. And tell me you can imagine Torgo with any other voice! In nearly every frame, you can see what they were *trying* to do (and might have succeeded at, had they been in more capable hands). The seemingly pointless teens kissing in the car serve as part of the \"fate\" concept-- if only the cops hadn't come along and shoved them off, the father might have been able to ask them for proper directions to get out of there. Or perhaps the teens are prisoners of the Master themselves! The ludicrous name of the \"god\" Manos-- actually quite fitting, since the cult is worshipping the fickle hands of fate. The ending is honestly skincrawly, finding out what happened to the couple's little girl-- and what's about to happen to the two new, roadtripping girlfriends.It's said that various people (Tarantino for one) are thinking of actually remaking \"Manos\". Here's hoping they never do. The fact that no one ever heard of any of the cast before or since contributes greatly to the eerie, last-known-photograph feel of the film. To see it remade with big name actors who are only capable of playing themselves-as-cult-hero would make it every bit as inane and bad as people are already saying the original \"Manos\" is. Let's leave it with the little bit of dignity is has, shall we?",

            "content": "\"The master would not approve.\" Considered and widely recognized by many to be the worst movie of all time (with a 0% on Rotten Tomatoes from eleven reviewers who actually sat through this thing), 'Manos: The Hands of Fate' does not disappoint in the least. And being that 'manos' is Spanish for 'hands', the movie would be entitled 'Hands: The Hands of Fate' in English, making it sound worse than it already is. How bad is the movie you ask? (sigh) Let's take a look. Shot at an estimated budget of $19,000 and shot entirely on location in Texas, tells the story of a family, wife Margaret, young daughter Debbie and the occasionally soft-core obscenity-spewing father (director Harold P. Warren) en route to the \"Village Lodge\" in El Paso. Eventually becoming lost, they finally encounter a house which is tended by the bizarre, bearded satyr-like cripple Torgo (John Reynolds, who claimed he was on LSD during shooting, ergo his character persona) of whom takes care of the home \"while the Master (Tom Neyman, also the set designer) is away.\" Torgo shows a painted portrait of the mean-looking mustachioed Master with a demonic-looking Doberman beside him. Upon Michael and Margaret finding their black pet poodle Peppy dead outside later on, they soon come to discover that their present lodging place is actually maintained by a polygamous pagan cult in worship to an unholy deity named Manos. What follows thereafter is irreparable and indisputable film-making on the lowest set bar: an unsynchronized, underwater (original) soundtrack, tedious pacing, terrible beats, atrocious acting and voice-over (dubbed by two men and a woman for Debbie) and flawed, forgettable characters. A scene of Torgo revealing his timid trichophilia towards Margaret and cat-fights in the sand from the Master's many wives, along with shooting on scratched, ten-minute film reels (which explains the choppy, careless editing) only adds to Manos' horribly laughable conception. With a 'Twlight Zone'-like ending, even that show had far more going for it that this movie ever can even begin to succumb to in the least.Made in 1966, fertilizer salesman Mr. Warren prided himself in saying how, on a bet, he could possibly make one of the worst movies of all time. At least he kept true to his word. Of course what one sells and what one directs are not all that far off in his case. None of the cast members ever appeared in another movie again afterwards, and I don't blame them or their resumes at all. 'Manos' developed a cult status in 1993 through Mystery Science Theater 3000, a show based on the premise of mocking and riffing B movies...this being of Z-grade movie no doubt. As a lover of quality cinema, sitting through this rotten egg of a picture was good enough for just one time to get a good laugh at something so flawed and obscure for once, and that the movie even relishes itself in the fact that it knows what it is and what it is trying to do as well. Watch the MST3K or RiffTrax improvisational comedy over 'Manos' instead, if the movie itself doesn't make you laugh over how clunky and stupid it already is. Or, if you dare, watch 'Manos' itself in all of its wonderful awfulness. Horrendous altogether, one has to see it to truly believe how the film has most rightfully, yet despicably, earned its title as one, if not already, of the worst in motion picture history...hands down.",

Maybe the reason was because the director really was tied to a tree the whole time Editing -- I can't decide whether it was done with cut and paste, or a hammer and chisel Music (Score) -- They used the wrong music at the wrong time Music (Song) -- \"Row Row Row Your Boat.\" Very bad singing Sound Editing -- Most of the duologue was dubbed. They did a very bad job at it. Their lips would start moving and two seconds later you would hear them talk. Mixing that with the music, it was very poorly done.Writing -- Not bad. When I heard of the plot, I was attracted to it, so I bought the movie. If all of the above would of been changed, this script would of made a good movie.Overall picture quality, just bad. I guess i this is the movie to see if you have ever been sitting around at home, and your wondering what kind of film a fertilizer salesman from El Paso, Texas would make. I thought i could put up with it, but I starting clawing at my face when the movie was finished, only taking breaks to kick myself in the head.I can say with true confidence that this is the worst movie ever made",

            "content": "After years of reading that Manos: The Hands of Fate is one of the worst movies that was destined to go to the very bottom of the annals of bad cinema, I finally rented it to catch the experience myself. How else was I to know how bad movies would get without watching what is called the ultimate in cheesiness? Well, Manos sure didn't disappoint. Or should I say, boy, it disappointed. I've seen many an Ed Wood movie, and I can say that even Mr. Wood himself seems like a master film maker next to the diseases that this movie is. Don't get me wrong, I mean that in a good way, really I do. There is nothing better then popping in the Mystery Science Theater version of this movie and hearing them poke fun at this movie. I laughed hard, and it made me think, what if? What if this movie was burned and never found... we would have lost a treasure! Watching the movie is a test in patience. It also ruins your intelligence and makes you feel that rather then watching a movie, you are watching a bunch o' hippies that are high and/or drunk sort of flow through an imaginary script. They should show this movie at a stress test, perhaps give you a passing grade, or a degree or something that states you've accomplished a feat that only a few can do.I can't even begin to tell you what scene would be the worst! Was it the loooong drive in the beginning, where nothing happens except driving set to some jazz music? The \"teens\" making out for days? The fact that the father is an idiot and led his family to all the craziness, amid the danger? The laughable audio that was dubbed in? The cat fights? Even the title of the movie, Manos, which means \"hands\" in Spanish, effectively makes this movie title \"Hands: The Hands of Fate\".What I can tell you is the best part of the movie: watching the \"Master\" come out with his robe and show off the big red hands stitched into it. That amused for about 4 seconds. All downhill from there. Actually, the whole movie was a downhill that kept going into the ground and never stops, winding up in some inner core lava.One gets the feeling that perhaps some of the actors, like maybe Tom Neyman or John Reynolds would have better served their art with a better script. One also gets the feeling that each and every person associated with this that saw the script, or met the director, or even smelled the manure on him should be drawn and quartered. It seems, though, that the cast DID indeed see how bad this movie was going to be by making fun of it, as they started calling it \"Mangos: The Cans of Fruit\".So, should you watch this movie? Oh yes, you must! ONLY if you rent the MST3000 version (I heard that an unedited version is now available, now THAT must be eye-gouging torture). It's good to see how bad a movie can get and still laugh at it. I give the movie a rating of 1, and the MST3000 version a 9! I was interested enough to try to find out as much information about this movie as I could when I found that a documentary called Hotel Torgo (2004) exists. There, they interview one of the last surviving members of the cast (I don't think they found any others that may still be alive) and even bring him to the location of the set, an old run down house in the middle of nowhere. It's worth a watch.A review of another film within a review? It can only happen with Manos: The Hands of Fate!",

            "content": "As I write this, there are already 143 previously existing comments for this film, and nearly every one of them mentions MST3K at some point.  That's the irony of MST3K-- if not for Crow and Servo and Joel and Mike, no one would ever see or even hear of movies like Manos.  It isn't lovable garbage, like the often-referenced Plan 9 from Outer Space, that you can watch with friends and laugh until your face hurts.  It's painful garbage, the kind of movie where you chuckle a little towards the beginning but after a while it stops being funny.  Is it the worst movie ever made, as is often claimed?  I personally don't think so.  It probably was the worst film that MST3K managed to obtain (and that episode, which actually makes something good out of this film, is some kind of comic masterpiece), but MST3K was by no means comprehensive.  Remember, they weren't allowed to show anything with any real level of violence or sexual content, so there are lots of sneaky movies out there ruining lives because they don't have the reputation that MST3K grants.  And I guess calling something \"the worst movie ever made\" is just a matter of personal sensibilities-- Manos is really boring, but there are movies that go far enough beyond the limits of bad taste to make me feel sad and angry and hopeless, like Necronomicon: Book of the Dead, Sword for Truth, Eaten Alive, Igor and the Lunatics, Knightriders, and even the illogically popular and overrated Dawn of the Dead.  Manos is a complete waste of time, but there are movies out there that are bad enough, in terms of both craft and content, to make you want to kill them.  And I personally don't think Manos goes that far.  You can make up your own mind, though, if you're ever unfortunate enough to see it.",

            "content": "Update: Viewed again on 1/13/18, after reading skimming the user reviews and most of the critic reviews. The first viewing is the best because you have no idea what to expect. I pity the fool who sees the Mystery Science Theater nonsense, that ruins everything. The 2nd viewing was amazing. This 3rd viewing was more of a study of the film. 1) We have a solid plot, with solid dialogue. I did not notice any plot holes. 2) the scenes and camera angles were clearly set up. Critics complain that there are moments of long pause. Like when the family meets Torgo. I did not have a problem with this. They were all confused and uncomfortable, including Torgo. Also, the scene where Mike and his wife were examining the paining of the Master, long pauses, it was great. Then we see Torgo walking in, followed by his music. Great stuff. 3) The music was totally appropriate and great. 4) The characters were great. All distinct. We have the dumbass arrogant pushy clueless husband Mike. We have his super young and hot wife, and their little girl, and the girl's puppy. We meet the cop with the great dialogue, the make-out couple getting drunk which adds normalcy and comedy relief to the film. The Master is basically a Dracula undead cult figure without fangs or sucking blood waking up at night. This time around, I did not enjoy the actor's performance or dialogue this time around. But that's ok. We get to meet the Masters 6 wives, the fist and last, arguing what to do about the family, then getting into a catfight. \nThe plot of the dumbass Mike getting the family lost and into the Masters house, then try to escape is fine. Torgo was molesting the Masters wives while they slept, then tries to make a pass at Mike's wife. This is all great stuff. The servant wanting his own piece of cake. The Master kills the deformed Torgo and the rebellious first wife, then replaces Torgo with Mike, and takes Mike's wife and daughter as part of his harem. Then we see another traveling due, two women also falling into the trap of the Master. \nMain problem with this film is the production. The acting, editing, dubbing, etc are subpar. I didn't have a problem with the story, music, or the cinematography. It's low budget, but it has all the elements of a decent film, just not produced with a high budget. \nMost people who hate this, or claim that it is THE WORST FILM OF ALL TIME are misguided, including the so called Professional Critics. The concentrate on Harold P. Warren being a fertilizer salesman with no talent that he made the film because of a bet. Or John Reynolds as Torgo was supposed to be a satyr wearing the prosthetics wrong and damaging his knees, needing painkillers, being addicted and killing himself. Or they criticize the dubbing. Fist, the dubbing was not that bad. Second, if you've watched enough foreign films you can forgive that. I believe if Warren had more money this film's production would have been more standard. First time viewers should see the original, not the joke version. There is a lot going on. Warren had a solid story. Hired attractive women. Memorable characters like Torgo, the Master and the wives. Some comedy with the makeout couple and cops. And unintentional comedy of the production. If you're done eating the candy crap that Hollywood produces without mistakes, take a look at this. It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's art. It's entertainment. Rating B, 7 stars, 10 for balance. I will also recommend: Scream Bloody Murder, Messiah of Evil, Footprints on the Moon - 1975, Last Man on Earth, White Zombie (best Lugosi movie), Don't Torture a Duckling (Lucia Fulci).Review from 1/6/18:\nThis is my second viewing of this movie. First time in 2016, 2nd time yesterday 1/6/18. I did not see the Mystery Science 3000 nonsense. I've skimmed through the user reviews and now I'm reading the \"Critic\" reviews. Most hate it, and consider it one of the worst movies ever made, or THE WORST. Me, not. My suggestion to these LOSERS is to go watch the Farce Awakens, or any other new movie. I watched Citizen Kane a few months ago, and consider it an important piece that should probably be viewed at least once, but will not watch it again. But I will watch Manos. The name of the game is ENTERTAINMENT. That is what we get here. We have a husband, wife, little daughter and her puppy getting lost trying to get to a vacation spot. There are a few dynamic comedy scenes with a couple drinking and making out, and cops hassling them all. This all breaks up the horror scenes. Nothing wrong with that. The husband is an irritating loser, and the wife is useless but at least she notices there's something wrong. We meet Torgo, deformed twitching groundskeeper. Great stuff. Try to find this guy in a new movie. The husband forces Torgo let them stay there. The wife doesn't want to stay. The little girl's puppy runs outside and gets killed. The first victim. Torgo falls in love with the wife. Great scene. The Master and his wives wake up. The Masters allegiance to Manos is great. The scene with his wives arguing and the Master looks on in disbelief is comedy gold. We then get a civil war cat fight between the 6 wives, 3 or 3 rolling around on dirt. Great stuff. The Master tortures Torgo for disloyalty and destroys his hand, Torgo runs off into hell. One of the Masters wives is also tortured for disloyalty. The family tries to escape and then returns to the house. Mike the husband is a loser. Mike shoot the Master, but nothing happens. The Master is a demon. Next we see the wife and her daughter have now become the Masters new wives, and Mike the husband has taken the place of Torgo. Twilight Zone. People criticize the dubbing. I didn't have a problem with that. They criticize the acting. That is a problem. The acting sucks. Except for Torgo, he is an original. I understand the actor killed himself before the premier. I'm glad he was part of the movie. The Master was ok. All the actors did their jobs, nothing great. There was one major editing problem. When the family first discovered the Master sleeping, with his wives, we see Torgo molesting one of the Master's wives.This is a great movie. My rating is a B, or 7 stars. 10 stars given to balance all the LOSERS who do not understand art. I am surprised at the supposed critics out there who can give garbage like Farce Awakens high marks. Or even garbage like Star Trek, Search for Spock high marks. But Torgo the Hand of Manos gets no respect. This is a strange and twisted movie. In a world polluted with candy films I welcome Torgo the Hand of Manos. The worst film ever made is not Manos, it is Star Wars VII, The Farce Awakens. Copy/Paste, Garbage actors, comedy relief, Kills of Han Solo (never liked his character or actor, but still a fan favorite), Luke runs away (the hero is now a loser), Rey is Wonder Woman, Vader Lite. Recycle Bin. Original Star Wars was a good movie, not great. But Farce is the Worst Movie Ever Made because it destroys, not builds.",

The performances of the actors and actresses are very bad, the directing is really bad, the editing, the original score, the script and all, everything in this film is terribly bad.

I always consider the genre horror is those kind of films that make audience(s) feel afraid. But when I watched it, I found that it's not a scary film. I even feel like the genre horror doesn't have anything to do with this film. The film is just a normal thing and doesn't have anything scary. So, why they put this film into horror category?",

But Manos - The Hands Of Fate proved me wrong. It was very disturbing, the first ten minutes when they are driving through the desert is awful. Disastrous plot. Disastrous acting. Disastrous dialogues. Very disastrous soundtrack (seriously!!). Nothing makes sense.This movie seems to be pretty short, a bit more than an hour, but be warned.

Simply put - it's very cardboard acting! The story for \"manos\" is completely ridiculous and pretty much makes no sense at all. It never takes the time to really play itself out through the movie. We get a little something about a family are on vacation and take a way wrong turn and end up at this little house! Though it takes them about fifteen minutes to reach the house. This time is spent showing the family driving through the country side and some really odd music which accompanies them. Once they reach the house, the story really seems to get even slower. It looks as if the film makers needed to resort to throwing in irrelevant scenes to make up for blank spaces of time. Two good examples are the scenes involving the two teen lovers in car kissing, I cop comes to break it up. Giving us some of the goofiest dialogue in film history. Strange things begin to happen that have nothing to do with the movie. These things happen way more then once through the movie and really leave you thinking \"the film makers didn't have a clue of what they were doing.\" I don't really want to recommend this movie to anyone, if you can find it without the mst3k commentary. this does make for one good Joel episode though.",

Warren (who also wrote the extremely talky and uneventful script), terrible acting from a lame no-name cast (Tom Neyman as the evil the Master makes for a dreadfully unscary and underwhelming villain while John Reynolds is strictly laughable as his weird limping servant Torgo), crude cinematography, a painfully draggy pace, zero tension or spooky atmosphere, a horribly droning and slushy score, loads of tedious filler, an insufferably whiny little girl, a meandering narrative, and some simply pathetic and unconvincing catfighting amongst the Master's wives. Not even the genuinely startling surprise bummer ending manages to redeem the overall mind-numbing boredom of this ghastly clunker. Worst of all, this putrid cinematic bilge is way too dull and flat to be enjoyable in its badness; instead it's just an excruciatingly listless'n'lethargic chore to endure. The total pits.",

No cameras were properly focused during the production of this film. b) Most, if not all of the footage is poorly chroma keyed -- it's washed out and dull looking. This impacts not only the overall film, but also makes \"c\" below even worse... c) It's about 30 minutes worth of actual footage/story padded out to 74 minutes by endless -- and yes, I do mean truly interminable -- shots of passing scenery -- along with throwaway scenes of people and events who appear nowhere else in the film and have no relevance to the plot or the story or anything except adding time to the movie. d) Oh, gad, the dialog is soooo slow and boring you want to rip your ears off just so something interesting will happen. e) Acting? Wut dat? f) Music. Ewwww. Just ewwww.... Either the soundtrack was also sold as the intermission music used in Drive-Ins throughout the 60s and 70s, or the other way around.In fact, it would be hard to list a single redeeming feature ANYWHERE in this movie. The only reason it got a \"1\" rating from me is because they don't allow negative numbers.I do not recommend you find an original copy. It's only tolerable with the MST3k commentary track.

After sitting through Manos (if you can) you'd pay big money to watch Glen or Glenda instead, so excruciating is the experience. Even watching the much lauded MST3K treatment of Manos proved to be a chore, even with Joel and the Bots mercilessly ripping the film to shreds with wisecracks. I don't think I've actually stayed awake through the entire movie in one sitting yet, only catching it in installments between lapsing into defensive comas during several viewings.I realize people might read these reviews or check out the bottom 100 listings here at IMDb and think, \"wow, I must watch this film that's getting all these comments\" but you have to believe me when I say that you REALLY don't want to sit through this garbage if you can at all avoid it. Films like 'Space Mutiny' and 'Future War' are hilariously bad, something you can laugh at because they're so ineptly made, but this one lowers the bar even more and frankly it just hurts to watch.

So what if it had laughable special effects, flying saucers that were clearly pie-plates and wooden acting?! It was at least enjoyable! For those of you high-minded snobs, I submit MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE. Though not anywhere near as notorious as PLAN 9, I couldn't possibly imagine a worse flick. In the mid-60s Hal P. Warren, a Texan fertilizer salesman, made a bet with someone that he could make a profitable horror movie on a low budget. Managing to pull together a cast and crew, they set out to realize his vision. The story: A family of three and a poodle drive around the Texas wilderness, trying to find a motel. Out of nowhere, a house appears. Standing by the door is Torgo, a disheveled man with big knees and a walking stick. According to the characters, it's getting dark, though in the background you can see they have a good three hours of light left. Much to Torgo's objections, the family decides to stay there for the night. As evening approaches, they hear strange howling in the desert. The poodle runs out... dead dog! And that's not the worst of it. A be-robed fellow and his wives are \"sleeping\" in the basement. And they wake up! What little plot there is follows the stupid family, especially the incompetent father Mike (played by Warren himself), as they panic and try escaping the \"house of horrors.\" There is absolutely nothing remotely scary about anything, the dialogue is boring and delivered flatly, there are literally minutes when nothing happens on screen. The ending is confusing and might leave you angrily frustrated. True-life trivia: A woman assaulted Warren after seeing it, so be warned! Originally, Warren planned to make it a trilogy. Thank God that dream was crushed! Only see it if you simply must see every movie in the world. Definitely watch the MST3K version!",

Ah, Manos. I know, it sounds like Latin porn, but this movie has something that precious few have these days--soul. From the opening scene shot from a driving car with an unstable camera, to the cat-fight beneath the \"Lodge of Sins,\" to John Reynolds' unprecedented and inspired portrayal of Torgo, this is more than just cinema, this is art. No, this is Art, and I mean what I say when I say that I would say that to anybody. This is one of those creations I wish I had created. Now, some critics of this film point out the lack of \"natural\" dialog. To that, I say, \"It's art--it's not supposed to sound like ordinary speech. No, it's supposed to sound lofty, to give wings to the soul and help it take flight, to entertain and make love to the fancy. . .\" Others say that The Master is played too coldly by Tom Neyman--to which I can only say, wouldn't you have to be cold to live in Hell? Or others, who complain that the women are not beautiful enough, as if they or anyone they know is beautiful enough! Beware, however, dear friend with an open soul and lofty ideals; one viewing of Manos can quickly turn to another, and another, and another, until the ecstatic state that this movie will move the willing heart threatens to burst the bonds of mere mortality and move one to a plane of perpetual and everlasting slavery to the beauty of Artistic Achievement that this work exemplifies. If I am incoherent, it is because I have already reached this state. All that can satisfy me now, is Manos. Not women's flesh, nor dark wine, nor French cuisine, not even sleeping naked between the sheets will ever afford me pleasure again. I am enslaved.",

It looks like either the people at Best Brains did some cleanup and restoration on the film to make it more presentable, or the print used for the non-MST3K DVD version was in poorer shape. So the film appears more scratched up then the MST3k version, and the quality of the sound track is uneven.The film does have a few extra scenes in it that had been cut from the MST3K version. (Here's the spoilers) There's a couple extra minutes in the car as Michael is busy getting the family totally lost, as well as some extended conversation between wife #1 and the Master as he's sacrificing her to Manos.If you're interested in seeing how Manos was originally presented, or if you want to see what had been left out in the MST3K version, this might be an interesting DVD to watch.

With, seemingly no plot, and some of the worst acting ever caught on film, '\"Manos\"' is an incomprehensible mess. It doesn't help that it was filmed on a silent-film camera and that the voices were dubbed in by a team of only three voice actors. Add the inept direction of Hal P. Warren, and '\"Manos\"' hits excruciating levels of awfulness. But I'll be damned if I couldn't take my eyes off it for a single second.Starring Torgo, a strange grounds keeper, '\"Manos\"' is supposed to be a horror film about a satanic cult. Hal Warren lets us know Torgo is evil by giving him a near-crippling knee deformity. OOOOHHH...SCARY. Torgo mumbles and stutters incoherently about his master, who wouldn't like having guests at their one-room motel. Mike, Maggie, and their daughter Debbie wind up said motel and then...basically nothing happens for the rest of the film. The plot moves so slowly and laboriously that it's better to just sit back and watch without thinking. At all. By doing this, I managed to make it through this awful movie and find out the \"mysterious\" ending, which I genuinely can not understand. Maybe it's better that way.The problems with '\"Manos\"' are numerous. Warren couldn't frame a shot to save his life, the actors couldn't act if you put a gun to their head, and the sets are cheap and poorly made. The film begins with an endless driving sequence, which was supposed to be the opening credit sequence. However they forgot to add the credits, so we're left with ten minutes of nothing. The two policemen in the film spend all their time hunting down a teenage couple who like to make out on the side of the road, and when the cops do investigate Torgo's motel, they do so by walking two steps in each direction. The dubbing is off. WAY off. And I do believe this is the film that originated \"Hey! I can see the zipper on his back!\" '\"Manos\"' has gained a cult following thanks to a spectacular episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Joel, Crow, and Servo provide their trademark witty remarks throughout, and also take time to remind us that we are indeed watching '\"Manos\" The Hands of Fate'. They can't believe they have to watch this, of all films, and neither can their tormentors, Frank and Dr. Forrester (and they picked the damn thing!). It's amazing that such a terrible film could turn out what some consider the greatest episode of MST3K.So, why did I give '\"Manos\"' a point? Because it's fascinatingly bad, and provides an important lesson in how not to make a film. This movie is so bad, that it warrants serious studying, just to find out why it wound up so bad. The documentary \"Hotel Torgo\" should provide some answers, and I hope to get the chance to see it.Should you see '\"Manos\"'? Yes, but only the MST3K version.The Master commands you!",

Roughly half the films on the Bottom 100 are there because of their being showcased on MST3K.

The plot has no rationale, the scenery is begging for something more... the extended drive time in the beginning is unbearable. Torgo is awesome, but we really never begin to understand his issues or why he likes to stuff his pants with pillows...I see Shout Factory has a special edition of the film, and I think it would be worth picking up.

Does this wonderfully entertaining movie STINK, or what???Ye lovers of famous el-smello cult flicks, thou wilt enter horse-manure heaven this very evening! Fans can get more belly laughs from this ridiculous film, which stars the magnificently frightening Torgo (most sensational movie monster since Hamlet), and features luscious, red-hot female nightgown wrestlers, than from almost any IMDb mainstream comedy.Gross insults aside, the Gourmet wrote this review to make a specific point. Many of IMDb's wonderfully entertaining Manos writers say, \"Even Joel and the Bots couldn't save this\". We respect their opinion on that, but in the special case of Manos, it doesn't really matter. If you have a taste for BAD movies, if you like to sample IMDb's bottom 100 list, if you enjoy watching MST3K and other hosted bad-film shows, then you MUST see this episode. Love it or hate it, MST3K's Manos is a landmark in entertainment, one of the bad-film shows by which all others are measured.However, for goodness sakes do NOT watch Manos without Joel and the Bots - even the Kaa-Kaa Gourmet would end up screaming in the loony-bin !",

Cheap and poorly dubbed, the filmmakers must be commended for pulling such an absurd concept off with a straight face.  Tom Neyman, as \"The Master,\" could've made a career out of playing quirky bad guys, and Torgo (John Reynolds) would have fit in nicely with that midget on \"Seinfeld.\"  The film is proof that indeed, anyone can make a movie.  It's not a matter of professionalism, but of having the right resources and a handful of friends available for a whole weekend of shooting.  In that respect, it's required viewing for any disillusioned person attempting to 'break through' in the industry.  By the way, this is also one of the best episodes of MST3K, and my star rating pertains only to that version.8/10",

            "content": "An acquaintance at IMDb talked about this infamous turkey in a way that interested me: \"If you can cast away your ideas of what a movie ought to be, you may be able to enjoy 'Manos: The Hands of Fate'.\" Truly, this is the kind of thing one treasures if they are into the weird world of ultra low budget schlock. And this movie, I could honestly say, is one of those little movies that's off in its own (dream) world. It plays out like the events of somebody's insane dream.Basically, a family - mom, dad (played by writer / producer / director Harold P. \"Hal\" Warren), and daughter get lost on their way to a place named Valley Lodge and end up at a back-of-the-beyond abode guarded by an oddball named Torgo, played by John Reynolds in all his twitchy glory. Torgo's guarding an entity he dubs The Master (Tom Neyman) who lives with an assortment of \"wives\". Will this family act normally, and get the Hell out of Dodge, or fall into the standard movie trap of being Stupid People Who Do Stupid Things? You'll just have to watch and see.The jazzy music score, by Russ Huddleston and Robert Smith, Jr., is just one of the hard-to-resist elements of this thing, which you'll likely watch while shaking your head, and laughing (sometimes simultaneously), or at least shaking your head. Warren stretches out moments to absurd lengths, presumably to get his movies' running time to over an hour long. Torgo in particular operates at about half the normal speed of regular people. And lines of dialogue tend to get repeated over and over - just to make sure we get the point. There's no danger of not knowing any of the character names here!The acting and the pacing is all awkward, yet Warrens' fumbling of his own material gives \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" a genuinely dreamy, out there quality that would make this a perfect midnight movie. One could easily watch this with friends while drinking and making their own wisecracks as it plays out. If they love bad movies, this one has to rank as one of the all time \"greats\".Five out of 10.",

            "content": "I rated this film five stars only because it's far more entertaining than most of the bloated, big-budget films we're seeing nowadays. I challenge anyone to tell me that there is any difference between the quality of this film and any of the comic book films that have been produced over the last fifteen years. There are some notable exceptions such as The Dark Knight, but can you honestly say that the entertainment value in X-Men Apocalypse or Batman v. Superman is any better than Manos? Manos is not an exception to the rule, bad films are still being made today, they're just dressed up a little more so you feel that your intelligence isn't being insulted.Yes the craftsmanship is poor, and the acting is terrible, and the dubbed dialogue is laughable, but you have to admit the music is pretty good. And let's not overlook the wardrobe, how cool is the master's robe when he stretches out his arms, that is one impressive robe. The props are good too, Torgo's staff and the fire-pit prop look like they were made by a talented artist. I haven't read through the reviews for this film, but surely I'm not the only one who was struck by the similarity between the master, his wives, and the Manson family, particularly when he orders his wives to kill Torgo. While i'm on the subject, where did these women come from? The ending implies that they're luckless vacationers who drifted too far into the cult's territory and became ensnared in it, but one wonders what happened to the families of these women. There must be a lot of shallow graves in the desert surrounding Casa Manos.Unintentional comedy fills the storyline, right down to the extended scene of the master's wives engaged in an epic throwdown, as they reevaluate their pecking order and establish a new alpha female. As in real life, the wives have all the power.For some reason my favorite part is the ending, with the two girls in the convertible:\"Sure is good to get away. Damn the rain.\"\"Vacations are fine, but this one should be great.\"\"Yeah, the gang is coming up for the weekend, what a blast.\"\"Hmm.\"At least this film doesn't insult your intelligence. It is what it is: an earnest attempt to entertain the audience.",

            "content": "First off, I applaud the idea behind this. The goal of creating a piece that wins over audiences in spite of a low budget is a commendable one, and had this had much merit, or even any, beyond said concept, I would be giving them props. Not so. It's surely all been said. The production value on this is zero... where did the money go? Credit for that, along with the summary, goes to my fianc\u00e9e. Having read the Trivia, I still don't understand how this got to be this bad. The pacing is nonexistent. The plot... what there is of one... is rehashed and poorly told. The twist and the acting(save for obviously the voices, among other things, they don't mix them up enough) aren't(all) necessarily the worst ever, though the way it's captured destroys the very hope of what might have been(the fact that the main guy behind this was a stage person with no directorial training whatsoever explains a lot). The attempts to master the cinematic language are marred by dyslexia and a nearly incomprehensible dialect. As basic a matter as the focus wasn't always achieved. The editing is just... while they did only do two takes of everything, and it was all in 32 second segments, that doesn't actually mean he had to do such a lousy job of putting it all together. There is a single good cut in the entire thing. That's it. The effects and believability, save for the aforementioned exception, are simply painful. The lighting varies from uninteresting to \"not there\". The dialog, which there is a decided lack of, is uninspired. An almost unforgivable amount of this consists of people... standing around. It's not shot well, either. Where is the horror? The atmosphere? The mystery? The scares? *What* is the soundtrack? Who thought to have jazz in this? This builds no suspense and contains no thrills. The framing is downright ugly. Between the never-ending sequences and scenes, the house of maybe(but certainly no more than) three rooms total, the four characters that could be excised with nothing lost other than running time, this is really barely worth a viewing, and if you must, I suggest the MST3K episode(albeit you can tell they were struggling for material... it's limited how many jokes you can do on this without repeating yourself). I can't say that I would have survived it if it had been the straight version. This is a textbook example of how not to do a movie, if it does tend to make the same mistakes constantly rather than numerous different ones. The title has an inherent ironic ring to it, as this was clearly made by a crew with broken hands, and of course, arms. I recommend this to anyone into B-flicks, and/or whatever else is this awful. The common theater-goer may want to avert their eyes, as this is likely to induce bleeding from them(meanwhile, that would be cooler than anything you'll see in this). 1/10",

If anything, (even though the film sucks) I applaud them.ON THE OTHER HAND (no pun intended), take a movie like Battlefield Earth. There's others, but this one get's my vote for worst film ever. There's a fine difference between Manos and Battlefield Earth. Think of the concept behind this. FIRST, some nit-wit (we know who) wrote Battlefield Earth. THEN it had to be pitched to an agent. Agents takes the project on, THEN it needed to be pitched to a producer(s), THEN the producer needed to package it with big name actors and take it to the studio. THEN the studio has to green-light the damn thing. Then a bunch of Hollywood idiots invested MILLIONS with the anticipation that the film will be a success. Hal Warren and his little Manos film shouldn't even be ranked in a worst category, simply because it didn't take much of a budget and no one was destroyed (except maybe Warren's ego.)

Those two are \"Troll 2\" and \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\". Well I'm here to tell you that whole \"Troll 2\" is bad in every sense of the word it is at least enjoyably bad. The same thing can't be said for this travesty. Sure you can get together with a group of friends and riff the hell out of it, but you can't really say that you enjoyed watching it.This movie was the brainchild of a fertilizer salesman who made the film on a bet. He used a wind up camera that could only record 32 seconds of film at a time meaning that no scene lasts longer than that. There were also no microphones meaning that everything had to be recorded in post. Add to that nobody involved in the entire process knew anything about acting or film production. The result was a hot mess of a movie that honestly doesn't make any sense.A family is driving in the desert on vacation and wind up at a compound where the father decides this is the hotel they've booked at. Why? It's the only thing around for miles so it must be the place. There, to greet them, is Torgo. He's a strange little man with huge knees who seems to have trouble walking. Torgo takes a liking to the mother. Stuff happens which is mostly forgettable and we find out the owner of the place is this weird dude with a harem of mind controlled women and he wants the mother and her young daughter to join his harem. There's some badly choreographed fights, one of the women in the harem dies from a light slap and like in the song \"Hotel California\", the family never leaves.The only actor to get anything out of it was the young girl that played the daughter. She got a bicycle out of it. The rest were supposed to get a share of the profits. But since it was shown in only one theater and people hated it, nobody got anything. The actor playing Torgo died before the movie came out from a drug overdose. Some say that it was partially due to the leg prothetics he wore. he was supposed to be a satyr but either the devices they designed for him didn't work or he wore them wrong and they caused him extreme pain.This really only should be watched out of sheer curiosity or masochism because there is no way to enjoy it.

The characters and settings are so clich\u00e9d one of the only original things about this movie is it features a mini documentary of various bean fields and hills hosted by an Alto who sounds as if she's in extreme pain. Tor-goat seems like a bum they pulled out of the streets and slapped prosthetics onto. The \"wonderful\" subplot of him being a Satyr is killed by a deadly team of bad camera-work and sloppy writing. To those not in the know, he's just a creepy beard-man in serious need of more comfortable kneepads. He and the master's \"eerie\" presence is denoted by \"eerie-er\" free-style jazz that sounds like something Charlie parker threw up, Tito Puente cooked and Kenny G garnished and ate. No, that applies to the rest of the movie. It's just so mind-bogglingly bad that it's impossible to watch without heckling it.

The only reason Plan 9 won years ago is because even TV late late shows wouldn't show this stinker.I have never seen such atrocious acting. I think the best(?) are the interminable \"dramatic\" pauses and the glares between characters. I'm fairly certain that the script writers (if there actually were any) wrote about 11 minutes of dialog for an hour+ movie, hence the dramatic pauses as the actors probably didn't know what the phrase ad-lib meant. Definitely see the MST3K version, I've seen both and nearly had to gouge my eyes out after watching it without any comic relief. The end with the little girl becoming one of the Master's wives is highly disturbing, but I suppose the director thought that he should do something considering nothing else happened in the movie.

Or because of the poor acting and random scenes involving two lovers in a car (which contribute nothing to the movie). But everyone is missing the point. This movie is about the character Torgo--the clumsy doorman of the hotel.Torgo is first introduced early in the movie as a suave and sexy advertisement model. He sells everything sexy from brandy to cologne to unmentionables. He was the heartthrob of a generation in his youth (from ages 18 to 24). Unfortunately, when he went through puberty at age 25, he developed what some doctors term \"hoofmitus legeranius\" which is characterized as \"a person whose legs turn into a horse's hindquarters\". His masculine face that beckoned people to \"come hither\" had transformed into one that said \"I'm going to come hither to you! Rawr!\" As a result of this radical transformation, Torgo had no choice but to seek council from the local cult. They told him that he must learn the ways of the world--that it is secretly run by a vampire man who keeps women as slaves in an abyss that exists somewhere in a hotel basement somewhere in a desert, which is also located in Indiana. Torgo is skeptical that this is the real world, but he has little choice. So he joins his friend.Hoping that his once good looks will be able to lure any unsuspecting guests of the hotel, he takes a post as a doorman. He eagerly greets all sorts of guests--those who got lost in the Indiana desert to... those who... well, that's really the only people who are ever able to find the hotel. For some reason, the guests are more repulsed and unsure of where they are when they see Torgo. But no matter, it is Torgo who will make sure that they are welcomed and have a relaxing time in the hotel.Anyways, as the movie progresses, you realize that maybe Torgo wasn't the primary character of the movie and maybe you missed the point of the movie and are completely confused by what in the heck is even happening.",

Except, Harold knew nothing about making movies, he had no professional actors and only had one hand-held camera that could film for only 32 seconds at a time. Without sound.It's the story about a family who get stranded in the middle of nowhere and look for help in an old scary house. The only one who's there to welcome them is the creepy servant Torgo. Before the night is over they find themselves at the mercy of The Master and his evil cult.Placed at a #4 spot on the IMDb bottom 100, this has got to be one of the worst movies of all time, right?I think it depends on how you define a bad movie. I've seen plenty of million dollar Hollywood movies that bored me to death. And Manos didn't. In fact, I loved it. Warren's pure lack of cinematic vision and experience is what gives this movie its unique atmosphere. The recurring library music, the choppy editing, the weird sound loops all contribute to the movie's surreal qualities. For instance the scene where Torgo (in my opinion, one of the most enigmatic heroes in B-movie history) tries to touch the face of Margaret goes on and on. In and out of focus. Nothing's really happening, but still you can't look away. It could have come straight out of a David Lynch movie. The fact that Warren probably didn't mean this scene to be weird and surreal doesn't mean that it's not working on a whole different level. It is what it is, intended or not.I've never seen the MST version and I'm not going to. It's like kicking a dog when it's already down. Watch the great documentary Hotel Torgo instead to learn something about the movie's interesting and often hilarious background. And watch the normal version of the film. You might see Harold P. Warren's dream of making his masterpiece. He invested his money, wrote a script and made his damn horror movie. He followed his passion and the fact that he failed completely is utterly irrelevant. 47 years later, people still watch it. They love it or hate it, but they'll never forget it.

Warren knew some big shots in Hollywood and thought he'd try to play with the big boys.  What he comes up with is one of the most painful experiences you can possibly imagine.  Several times while watching the film (especially during the opening segment which features endless minutes of the main characters driving around) I thought I'd die from laughing too hard. This film makes your stomach muscles hurt.  Even after the film is well over, you're still laughing, wondering how such a film could possibly be made.While the technical mistakes might be able to be forgiven, make no mistake: Warren effortlessly throws in every bad movie cliche in the book without even knowing it, from the stereotypical \"weak\" female protagonist, to the laughably bad wrestling scene.  To give you some idea, one of the main characters is nearly killed by women in white dresses who slap him.Combine this with a script that is about three pages long, a plot that doesn't even make sense, banal music, and out of focus camera work, and you have a truly horrible and wonderful experience known only as \"Manos\": The Hands of Fate.",

I don't know why, but when a movie is very terrible, i tend to enjoy watching. maybe its because i'm a filmmaker and like seeing others fail. i don't think its that though, i think its more that I understand the process going on to make this junk and its delightful in a funny way. Keep in mind, Manos is Hal Warren's first and only film. Losts of people overlook that fact and its taken for granted how hard movie making truly is. Even Warren took it for granted by making the bet to make this(He lost the bet obviously. The guy he lost to went on to win an Oscar(Screen writing) for In the Heat of The Night for those of you who like Manos trivia). Most directors today who come out with a great big first feature have actually been directing for decades in music videos, television, and commercials. You hardly ever will meet someone who just all of sudden picked up a camera and begin making gold. Orson Welles had much knowledge of what makes a great story and had a flare for the dramatic. He was also a very talented magician. all which aided him(along with others like Toland) to make him great. Hal Warren sold fertilizer, he shouldn't have been able to make a good movie even in the 1960's.This is one of the strengths of the film i feel. Its a raw look at someones first attempt in to the art of cinema. I would really have loved to see Warren make a few more films. Every film is a learning process, he might have learned from his mistakes how to shoot a good action scene, how to write good dialogue, and how to treat a crew and actors to maximize the film.All in all, it's a dreadful film and most everyone hates it. I love it cause like an Ed Wood movie, it's a sincere attempt at something, and its an absolute car wreck.Note: The rating of one is to reflect the value any normal viewer will feel. for film fans or film junkies(if you like bad movies) this is certainly a ten.",

In a century of film making, there have been some wretched pieces of work, but Manos is the undisputed heavy weight champion of ineptitude. When we discuss the merits (or lack thereof) of a film, elements such as script, screen play, directing, casting, acting, cinematography, composition, continuity, visual effects, sound, lighting, set design, editing, post-production and numerous other aspects must be considered. As several other reviewers have stated, Manos is a total train wreck in every conceivable category. It was filmed with a single hand-held, spring-wound 16mm camera that could only shoot for 32 seconds at a time. And in order to save film (and money) H. Warren (Director) did almost no retakes. So, as you can imagine, the camera movement is closer in technical proficiency to a backyard birthday party video than a professional feature film. The film was also shot with no audio. All of the dialogue and other sounds were dubbed after shooting, with predictably dire results. From a purely technical perspective, this film would be 70 minutes of blinding pain, were it not for the fact that, much like the visual quality, the sound transcends the realm of bad to the point of being comical. What about the acting? Hold on a minute. I'm still searching for a word that might begin to describe the shear debacle of the performances. I can't seem to find just one word, so I'll give you two. John Reynolds. His portrayal of the character Torgo has gone beyond legendary and reached mythical status among the movie-going public. And for good reason. Please read some of the other Manos reviews for the particulars about Torgo, there are just too many to go into, and I really wouldn't even know where to start (although the ridiculous \"goat legs\" would probably be the logical starting point). One would think that given the numerous technical and artistic elements involved in a feature film, something, just one thing could be done at a mediocre level, even under the direction of a snow-white amateur like Harold Warren. And therein lays the reason for our fascination with Manos. That is to say bar none, absolutely every possible mistake imaginable was made in this movie.

Distributed by Emerson Film Enterprises (who four years earlier had gifted us 'The Creation of the Humanoids'), like most films famous for being really, REALLY bad 'Manos' certainly isn't up to much, but is hardly THAT bad. Anything made around that time by Elvis Presley or Andy Warhol is a far greater trial to sit through; and turning in a lousy film on a microscopic budget doesn't take much doing.The attention is engaged throughout, whether by the annoying jazz score, the swarms of moths that flutter about during the night-for-night scenes, The Master's foxy coven of wives in diaphanous white robes, glossy red lipstick and sixties permanent waves, and the enormous red hands printed on The Master's ceremonial robes that make him resemble Kenny Everett as Brother Lee Love; all in glorious sixties Eastmancolor!Jackey Neyman as young Debbie never seems to be paying much attention to what's going on around her, while the late John Reynolds - whose beard I could never figure out was real or not - staggers about as if he's recently suffered a stroke.",

When they stop to ask for directions, they encounter Torgo (the caretaker) a half goat/half man, but with the bad prosthetics, it just looks like he has footballs shoved in his pants so you can't tell that he is actually a satyr. Although Torgo is reluctant, he lets the family stay for the night, knowing that his 'Master' will get mad for letting a man and young girl stay at the house (all he wants is a new wife). The voices of the characters were dubbed (mostly) by Hal Warren and Diane Mahree, but it isn't exactly in sync. The soundtrack (if that is what you want to call it) is very bad jazz and doesn't seem to flow with the film. The first scene when the family gets lost, seems to take forever because they forgot to put the credits in the beginning, so there is no talking, just driving. This movie is for a tough audience and is also physically draining, so if you watch it, make sure to get the MST3k version and/or lots of caffeine.",

From what I've read, he reportedly spent a good deal of his time on the film high, and I think you could see that was probably true. But let's be honest, how could anyone agree to and then go through with appearing in this stinker without a little help from their friends? I don't do drugs myself, but I felt like I must've been on something to be able to sit through this snoozer for that long.

            "content": "In no way is \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" a good movie, but it is one where you leave your brain at the door and enjoy it! I admit to liking things other people hate like the movie \"Wild, Wild West\" and old episodes of \"Full House.\". I discovered \"Manos\" when Jackey Neyman (Debbie) wrote about her experience of doing this film with her father, the late Tom Neyman (the Master). She was only 6 or 7-years-old at the time. This movie was the brainchild of fertilizer salesman, Harold P. Warren. It's a tragedy when someone is on their deathbed and they regret one or more dreams they didn't make true! The dreams can be anything from writing a book, traveling through Europe or making a movie despite having zero experience in the art of movie making. I guess Mr. Warren wanted to be known for more than fertilizer and the movie was on his bucket list. Our heroes of this piece are Harold P. Warren who also wrote and directed as Michael. Diane Adelson as his wife, Margaret and Jackey as little Debbie. They also have their little dog named Peppy with them. They are traveling by car and wind up at the home of the Master amidst cops on duty and two teens making out in their car. Michael, Margaret and Debbie end up at the Master's house. They are greeted by Torgo (the late John Reynolds) who committed suicide after the filming. He is quite memorable as this creature who is part man/part satyr. He also was heavy in the drug scene and his twitchy and jerky performance is the result of LSD.The budget for the movie was so low he wore metallic rigging under his pants to give the impression of satyr legs. The family is invited into the house by Torgo and they see a picture of the Master on the wall. The Master is sinister-looking and wears a black robe with red hands painted on the front in giant proportions. He is shown with his evil-looking dog. Jackey says this dog was the family pet and not evil at all! The Master has brides dressed in white gowns. All of the brides are asleep in one room and are standing up in that state. The Master is sleeping lying down. The brides wake up and argue about the family. Torgo wants Margaret as his bride but the Master won't allow it! He has his brides massage Torgo to death. Another death happens to Peppy by the Master's dog. The family escape into the desert on foot because their car doesn't work. People in scary movies act like morons! The family could escape and find the cops or the face- sucking teens to help them, but they don't! They go back to the house and are captured. Now Michael is the guard of the house and Margaret and Debbie are the new brides. This movie is terrible in every conceivable way! The acting is awful from all except for the Master and Torgo! The scenery goes on forever and I was scratching my head at the necking teens because they had no place in the movie. This movie is a guilty pleasure and you feel bad if you like it. On \"Modern Family\" Phil and Clare said one of their guilty pleasures was going to the theatre and watching bad movies. I like good movies but I also like bad movies if I can find something good in them. The lates Tom Neyman and John Reynolds were both great in their roles as villains and they made this movie so bad it's good!",

Anyone could do it. Hal Warren was given some money and the rest is history. Most of the people working on the film knew something was up. They all agreed to do it in return for shares of the profits. But in Producers fashion, the shares added up to 300%! In the end, the only casts members to be \"paid\" were the little girl (a bicycle) and the dog (50 lb bag of dog food). They knew they were in trouble, but were assured all the mistakes could be fixed in some magic editing room. Which ceased to be an option when the money started running out. There was a premiere which the casts went to.. all but Torgo, who committed suicide a few weeks earlier (not resulting from being in the movie). It was at the premiere the cast found out their voices were all dubbed! There was silence for about 15 minutes.. then some chuckles.. which evolved into out and out laughter! The producer and director didn't stay, and went to a bar. The place where it was filmed is still around and somewhat of a cult tourist attraction. The little girl remembers the guy who played Torgo as being the nicest, but others thought he was on acid the whole time!. The girl remembered the director as someone who yelled all the time and wasn't very nice. Say what you will about this movie.. it certainly has it's place in history, but people need to stop calling it \"genius\" or \"classic\". It's also wrong to compare it this to Ed Wood Jr. At least he had passion about what he was doing.. he thought he was making classics.. Manos: The Hands Of Fate was made on a bet!",

Good for a drinking game (like: which shots are in focus or not, or spotting continuity errors - Hell, the whole movie is a continuity error!), but only with beer, not hard liquor! Every 3 seconds or so something goes wrong: continuity, framing, dubbing, acting, editing (!!!!), dialogue, music, cinematography - EVERYTHING goes wrong, and all of the time. It becomes clear after the first 10 seconds that no person involved in the production had ANY history in making or starring in movies. The incompetence is unparalleled. Edward D. Wood Jr. (Glen or Glenda, Plan 9 from Outer Space) would rotate in his grave to witness such rampant inanity. They used 1 woman and 2 men to dub ALL the characters in the film, which was shot with a silent camera (Brilliantly, they did no record the audio separately, leaving the dubbers without a clue about what was actually being said!!!). MANOS is fascinating for two people involved in the production: John Reynolds, who played Torgo (and is obviously on LSD all the time - he killed himself shortly after production had wrapped and never saw the finished film - lucky him!) and Tom Neymar, who not only played The Master (whose plans remain as foggy as the cinematography) but also made his own costume and painted his self-portrait which is central to this movie. They're all dead now, including Harold Warren, who made this \"film\" on a whim. MANOS stands there as the epitome of cinematic ineptitude - but it's not funny bad, it's just bad. Now, if you really want to watch a so-bad-it's-good movie, seek out SAMURAI COP! Now, that's an entertaining fiasco. This one, it's just a fiasco.",

However, in a way, all these problematic technical aspects sum up to a fascinating experience that doesn't bears any resemblance to what most come to expect from movies in general.

Having already gotten all the laughs I will ever get out of the haunting Torgo theme from MST3K, I actually watched this thing as I think it was meant to be seen.  You know, it's funny (the irony, not the movie), but without MST there, you will really never laugh - there is just something evil about Manos that wafts from the screen and makes you want to take a shower with sandpaper to get it off.  NOTHING redeeming happens (all the main characters and the dog die or become slaves), the cast is made up of real-life weirdos that you would simply never WANT to watch. Imagine (well, you can't) that this became a hit in 1966 - would you really want to meet the actor that play the Master?  The only character I'd be curious to meet killed himself.I guess what I'm trying to say is that this movie not only wasted 70-some minutes of my life, it actually made me a worse person having seen it. Manos: Hands of Fate is not campy, is not fun (except for Torgo I guess), is not interesting or thought provoking (yeah, as if); it's mean-spirited and uncomfortable, and not even in a sleazy way.  It does have a more coherent plot than other sub-Z type movies, but that works against in the end simply because the plot's so wretched.

It was very, very difficult to sit through, and it used up pretty much all the resolve I had. I'm not an expert, and I have not seen every movie there is to see, so I can't definitively tell you that this is the worst movie of all time, but it is, without question, the worst movie I've ever seen.There is something to be said for movies that are \"so bad they're good\". But this film goes beyond the realm of \"so bad it's good\" straight into confusion, dullness, and straight-up unpleasantness. It's so bad, it's just painful. I know probably every other person who's written a review of this has said this almost word for word, but it's so true, it's impossible not to say it. \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\", often considered the worst movie of all time, is a magnum opus by comparison. Yes, \"Plan 9\" is nonsensical, unintentionally funny, and not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, but at least it counts as a film. It is a heartfelt, genuine attempt at filmmaking, and it was evident that Ed Wood really believed in it and gave it his effort. I would even go so far as to say it's entertaining. Much of it is, anyway. I really don't know that \"Manos\" qualifies as a film. There is something passing for a story in it, but it is so poorly told, acted, and directed that I really don't know that it counts. And even if you could follow the plot, you wouldn't really want to. It's certainly not entertainment. What story there is is buried in the complete lack of pacing. The long driving sequence at the beginning is painfully boring to sit through, and it never really gets more interesting than that. May as well just go for a drive yourself. You'll have a lot more fun.It was made on a budget of about $19,000. And it shows. Even if you know nothing about how movies are made, you can't help but see how unfinished and unedited \"Manos\" is. The clapboard is blatantly left in one of the shots. There's a young teen couple who make out in their car, and they appear a few times, yet are completely unnecessary to the plot. There's no reason for them to be there. The jazz soundtrack, while I don't entirely hate it, is completely unfitting and just adds further to the unpleasantness. Just awful. The one thing about the movie that held my interest at all was the character of Torgo. Even though he really has no back story (there's no such thing as back story in a movie this awful), he does have a bizarre presence that is somewhat compelling to watch, and he even has his own musical theme, as MST3K pointed out. Don't get me wrong, he's not a pleasant character. His dialogue is just as stilted and awkward as anything else in the movie. But honestly, with what he obviously had to work with, he really wasn't that bad, I guess. Maybe it's just that the rest of the film was so incompetent that he looks really good by comparison, but he was the best thing about \"Manos\" by far. At least he left an impression. John Reynolds, the actor who played Torgo, shot himself a month before the film premiered. Apparently his suicide was not related to the film, but I can't help but feel sorry for the guy. This was his only film role, the only legacy he got to leave behind. This is totally hypothetical, and maybe not even true, but he just might have gone on to something decent, if he'd survived. Even if he only did b-movies, anything would have been better than this. The only reason I might recommend watching this movie is if you want to know just how bad a movie could be. Before I saw this, I really had no idea movies could be this bad. But if you absolutely must see this film, please, do yourself a favor and watch Mystery Science Theater's riff of it. Even they have a hard time making it funny, but it helps a little, because this film is just...well, I've said it all. I've also heard the guys from MST3K (who now do RiffTrax) are doing a completely different riff of this movie that might be worth checking out. But please, don't watch it without their comedic assistance.",

How did they manage to pad out a simple plot like that into a quarter of an hour? With tons of shots of the passing countryside as they drive! By the time they get to the house and meet a guy I believe is named Tardo (who has the kind of swag you'd only expect from a guy whose bones are made of gelatin (apparently we're supposed to be scared by gimp-walking)), and I'm not saying that as a joke, I literally think that's the name they call him, you'll be bored out of your mind. Then they get to the house and stay the night because\u0085I guess people were more trusting back in the day. We're given tons of shots of African furnishings bought from the local Pier One Imports that are supposed to be horrifying.Anyway, the house is home to some creepy porn-star-cum-cult-leader who wears the stupidest looking poncho/robe I've ever seen. He has a harem of women and sacrifices people to the dark lord Manos. Blah blah blah he takes the family and turns them into his slaves and this movie has no point.Everything about this movie is stupid. It's not helped by the fact the film is shot horribly and they dub over the film, because getting a microphone would have cost way more than this movie was budgeted! What's even worse is that this movie is seventy minutes and is padded out so much just to reach that mark! So many landscape shots and this pointless focus on a couple of kids making out in the desert (who keep coming back to the same spot again and again for some reason).The only thing I can give the film credit for is a shot where we're shown the owner of the house and his dog and it cuts to a painting of the two. In better hands, that could have actually been eerily effective. I also thought that the ending, as clich\u00e9 as it was, would have worked if I understood how the owner of the house survived being shot four times.Manos is a watchably terrible movie, but it's still garbage.",

Maybe a 4 if you find B movies acceptable in their own way, or if watched with the benefit of the MST3K guys (I wanted to give a 3 since Joel & crew gave me some laughs, then I remembered what I was rating). But a 10 vote!? The votes for this had the bell-curve around 1, so the 10 votes had to be an anomaly. I wish IMDb had a way to kick the obvious irritation votes. For example, 1 votes for \"The Godfather\" and \"Schindler's List.\" What does such an individual consider quality film-making by comparison? \"Debbie does Dallas?\" (sigh)This is a bad movie that is a must-see by any film buff. It gives a sense of scale. (It's a bit like taring a scale to 0.) The only way to possibly enjoy it is to watch it with the MST3K comments. When the master confronts Torgo, a full two minutes goes by watching him wordlessly approach Torgo and we watch Torgo struggle to his feet. After some funny patter during this scene, Joel finally screams \"Do something!\" The MST3K crew is the only life given to the film where aiming the camera at an average street corner would provide more action and plot.",

I had to see it ! The fact that I was watching the MSTK3K version didn't spoil it; I thought it might be irritating with some people blabbing away on top of the dialogue, but: no problem ! Because there is very little dialog in the movie, and the dialog that's there, well.... sucks !I thought Plan 9 from outer space was the worst, but we have a new champion.None of the actors can act and framing and clipping is off the scale ! ! ! The music is always, always out of place, a mix of soft jazz with a trumpet that won't stop, and what you might characterize as porn music, or something from a VERY sleazy night club.Actors do stare at each other for minutes, I thought that was a joke made by someone here, but noooo, it's the awful truth. In a lot of scenes they just stand around without doing anything ! Just pay attention to the scene where Torgo gets out of bed and stands in front of the master. I would say it lasts a good 2 minutes.And the \"night-chase\" where the family is being pursued through the woods at night, well it's gotta be the worst chase-scene ever made. With the music being out of place of course, accompanied by hideous lighting making it hard to make a damn thing ! Kinda like a Lars Von Trier movie during a night-scene.The movie shows a host of uninteresting things, shot from horrible angles, in the most bizarre lighting ever.There is a couple in a car kissing away for hours, and they have nothing to do with the story at all, which is kinda strange ?Take all the acting talent of all the \"actors\" in this movie, multiply by 10, and your'e still miles away from Chuck Norris on a bad day.The movie was shot on a camera from 1489 that could record only 30 seconds of film at a time, without recording sound. Most of the clips look like they are randomly put together, and 3, THREE people did the voice-over and dubbed the movie, meaning ? Yep, in a lot of scenes you can't make out who's talking. Nice.Did I mention the director was a fertilizer salesman from Texas ?OK, some movies are so bad they are good, and yes the first time I saw Manos, I was laughing and twitching away. When I saw it the second time, I my mind was numb and I wasn't laughing; it was worse the second time, and God help me, I wonder what the third time might be like. Yes, this is one of those movies that get worse every time you see them, because you notice things you didn't see the first time, things that you wish you hadn't noticed anyway.You gotta see this to believe it ! I Was full of expectations and giggling as I put it into the DVD because I was wondering: what does the worst movie ever look like ? Let's just say it exceeded my expectations, I mean it was staggering !A friend of mine made a crap movie for fun a few years ago, and my god, it looks like the masterpiece of a genius compared to this.A number of people here gave it a 10/10.

Believe me, if I could I'd give it a negative ten star rating. It is just that bad.There are so many things wrong with this movie:1. The actors all just happen to be completely talentless, and I'm pretty sure that the majority of them are on Valium or something. They don't make the mistake of overacting, which at least would be entertaining to the audience. Instead, they underact in the worst way. No matter what the situation, the dull, drugged expression will not leave their faces. 2. The dialog, or rather the lack thereof, is simply atrocious. There is so much repetition, which might have been okay if the actors had only had any feeling or emotion in their voices.3. The story. Some parts of this movie were so bad that I couldn't even watch anymore. I had to just close my eyes and force myself to breathe. I'm pretty sure that at one point, the overall atrociousness of this movie brought tears to my eyes. 4. The action. WHO taught these actors to slap? Who taught them to fight? Those fight scenes were pathetic, and no human could ever have been injured in one of those rows. Honestly. There are at least three hundred other negative things to say about this movie, but if I got into those, I'd be here all night. I swear, I couldn't have made a movie that bad if I'd tried, and I doubt anyone else in the universe could either. It's almost as though they were trying to make THE worst movie ever, and succeeded.The MST3K version of this movie is absolutely hysterical, however, and I think that everyone should watch it. Just make sure you don't make the mistake of watching the original version. You might not make it out alive.",

Anyways, \"Manos...\" has generated somewhat a cult and it's even more popular than many good Horror movies.The truth is this : the movie is terribly bad. Not unintentionally funny, but just plain bad, mediocre. The fact that this was filmed with zero budget doesn't means that it deserves pity or something. No, the movie reaches high levels of mediocrity. For example, the acting. None of the actor deliver even a regular performance. I guess none of them had even acted in school. The direction is poor, poor. In fact, the \"director\" just shoot a movie without knowing how to use the camera. I won't even get on the cinematography or art direction because it would be humiliating.But in reality, \"Manos\" is a movie everyone seem to love for sentimental reasons. It seems that even though there are minimal production values, the producer tried too hard in order to create a serious movie. For example, I went like \"awwww\" when I watched the movie's climax or when the master explained about Manos. It's like, you can't be cruel with this movie. In fact, people should recognize it as one of the most popular bad movies that have ever existed.It's that popular that MANY avid Horror fans have watched it. Please, avoid it like the plague but if you watch it by accident or something, don't be too harsh with it. It's like this movie is hiding from the world and does not want to be watched. Don't disturb it.I can't give it a rating... I don't know why.Trivia: watch the creepy trivia for this movie on it's IMDb page. Many people committed suicide after the movie's release. Mmmh... do you think Torgo or the Master had something to do?",

The plot was almost non-existent. The cinematography was hideous. The design was shoddy. Half the scenes had no relevance to whatever minor flow the movie had to begin with. It was, however, another one of MST3K's shining moments (but even they were often in awe of how miserable this flick is!) To date, this is the worst movie I have ever seen.

I dare say what we really have hear is a bad movie buzz and that this movie's lousiness is actually rather vastly overrated! Don't get me wrong now, it was terrible, the grainy look of it was unbelievably ugly and unappealing, and the voices were so hilariously muffled and distorted sounding that I really thought it was dubbed! But the thing was, despite myself I had a bit of fun with it, it made me laugh a lot because of how weird the atmosphere and setup was and how everything was so shoddily slapped together. It was a story that couldn't handle a story and one that I had trouble following at all, most of the time I was like, \"what's going on!?\" The director went mad! It was so stupid and funny the way it had stuff like the lame Egor knock-off character who had his own limping music, and when the main priest guy wearing the cloak with the big red hands on it would malevolently laugh at nothing at really inappropriate times, and his laughter was so poorly looped! It made me laugh at the part where he commands the god of hands Manos to awaken his squad of priestess wives, and they all immediately start bickering at once, and his expression looks like he's one second away from beseeching mighty Manos to put them right back to sleep! I love when all the wives get into a ridiculous cat fight that jumps film cells, probably kills a few brain ones, and goes on for just about forever, it was beautifully orchestrated nonsense. I'm a fan of hand-to-hand combat.. I wasn't that bored by it, at least I don't think I was. The movie has a bit of a hypnotic mind-whammy thing going on if you're not wary! It was such a messy oddity of a film that I was ready to hate so much that I ended up finding it strangely enjoyable and somewhat entertaining. I've seen way worse bad movies, ones that really made me angry while I was watching 'em, but not so much with this one. For me it's horrendousness made it almost cute. And it's certainly garnered an impressive amount of attention for all the wrong reasons over the years. Oh man though, I am never gonna give anybody a hi-five again!",

I love watching cheesy old oddball B-movies, but not with a bunch of silly robots ruining the experience.

I saw it for the first time just now, and I'm still baffled. This is not a case of \"so bad, it's good\". It's not even a case of \"so bad, I want to spew my run screaming into the woods, using my own hand for a torch\". This movie reaches beyond \"bad\", and comes out on the other side. It's set entirely in a parallel universe, where time and logic are twisted beyond recognition for mortals. What looks like Texas is actually the other end of a worm hole, where the fabric of space has turned itself inside-out.It HAS TO be this way. How else could a movie be so indescribably... not \"bad\", that word is to simple and two-dimensional... mesmerising, but yet so extraordinary painful and genuinely creepy... you feel the movie slowly pressing a pole into your blackened heart, and you make sure to keep the remote control near in case you should feel a psychosis coming... but still you're always on the verge of laughing your head off... and at the end, you can almost feel your brain suppressing the whole experience, and you will never, never be sure what actually happened during these 80 minutes.THIS MOVIE IS EVIL. If you're looking for a great turkey experience, something out of this world, that leaves you with a smile on your face and a somewhat altered way of relating to movies in general, I suggest \"Glen or Glenda\".I guess I will never look upon more ordinary B-movies the same way again.

Soo the family will be in trouble with \"The Master\" and his wives, when they are trying to use them for their sacrifices.This is the plot of this unique and bizarre low-budget horror film, that is ranked as one of the worst films ever made here in IMDb. And that has lots of bizarre things around it, for example that nobody who work in this film never appears in other film and also exist a rumor that some of the cast committed suicide shortly after the release of the film, anyway according to the 2004 documentary \"Hotel Torgo\" there are no proofs of that rumor.And the film itself is full of bizarre things that works as a lesson of bad cinema. I mean since the title, \"Manos: the Hands of Fate\", because the word \"Manos\" is Spanish for \"Hands\" so the real title is \"Hands: The Hands of Fate\", really bizarre. And well the act is just bad, the edition is one of the worst ever and there is a continuity mistake in almost every scene. The characters are really strange, specially Torgo that is my favourite and also the couple of teenagers in the car, there is nothing that involves this characters to the plot so is really strange. But this is the magic of this kind of films, that it supposed to be an horror film but in the end is nothing but a really funny comedy so is truly entertaining to watch and works excellent for having some fun with this lessons of bad cinema.Conclusion: I really love this So-bad-they're-good cult films, so i highly recommend this film to anyone that loves cinema, watch this film just for pure curiosity and to know how do you make an horror film that looks like one of the best comedies ever. So watch this film and enjoy it as one of the funniest films ever.DVD: I first know about this film because of it awful rank in IMDb and later because of Quentin Tarantino, who is a fan of this film. So i really want to watch it; last weekend i bought a 100 Movie Pack of Horror Classics from Mill Creek. I was really happy because this film was in the pack and it was the first that i saw. The quality of the DVD is not so god, its like it was recorded from an old VHS cassette, but i'm pretty sure that is the best quality possible for this film so is great to have it in my collection.",

Finally i want to WARN YOU people do not watch it with use on any kind of recreational drugs or alcohol you may remove your own eyes,have panic attacks,a strong feeling of pessimism or even a permanent brain cell damage.This film is used by the CIA as a method of torture,from Navy Seals Instructors in Hellweek to keep students awake or even the Prince Of Darkness in Hell in a new DTS 7.1 Remastered Edition because as it is well known physical pain can be tolerated this film SERIOUSLY NOT.\u03a5.\u0393 I wonder what experimental drugs have given to the Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys to withstand re-edit this until the end without suicide and feel wretched pity about being editors.",

            "content": "This, one of the Bottom 3 films of all time, was screened last week in New York, where it likely made more money than in its original theatrical run. I spent about two-thirds of the film's run time shouting \" What is this god-damned movie even about? \" For its final third, I didn't care what it was about, I just wanted it to end. Seriously, I couldn't even tell you what genre this film could be classified as, nor could I tell you what the plot is about.Apparently, filmed in a matter of days, on a budget of only a few thousand dollars, and screened only a couple of times in El Paso ( where it was filmed ) , and then lost for decades, until its rediscovery by Mystery Science Theatre 3000, this is seriously one of the worst, most excruciatingly boring films ever made. It's barely even mockable, let alone reviewable. The music score consists of competing sax, and ivories being tickled in the most obtuse, out of place fashion, seemingly intended for some other movie, and it's used throughout almost every scene. Most times\u200b I've heard the title/ lead character's name spoken, it's MAN-os, but in the dialogue in the film, it's pronounced like MAH-nos. However his name is correctly pronounced, I kept waiting for his dog to bite him. No such luck.A middle aged nuclear family ( a grumpy old man in ridiculously over-sized trousers, his whiny, nagging wife, and their young daughter, who serves absolutely no purpose in the plot of film ) are driving in the desert ( for the first nine minutes of this movie ) and lose their way. They babble about the weather, are stopped about a broken taillight by a cop with nothing else to do, who later hassles a young couple kissing in a parked car ( and the visible guy holding the clapperboard ) on the roadside. The female half of this couple is clearly bored, as she repeatedly delivers her lines while looking directly into the camera. Was this nine minutes long scene really necessary in setting up the plot of this movie? The family comes across some type of home, inhabited by Torgo, a 25 years old man in old age make-up ( because that always works so well ) , hobbling around, who repeats almost every line of dialogue twice. After their car won't start, they're stuck in this desert overnight, where slightly weird, but mostly just interminably boring, things happen. Torgo tells them \" The Master \" is dead, but eventually, a hidden, sort of Satanic-looking room is found, where \" The Master \" is shown apparently alive after all. He's a John Astin lookalike in black robe with red hands, acting grandiose, in front of a group of women, who do little more than sit around and talk for several scenes, before a catfight erupts. The family from the first half disappears for most of this second half, while the John Astin clone and his six wives do ... stuff, ... possibly killing Torgo, because yeah, sure, of course they do. The kissing couple appear again, at night. It looks like they're parked next to a gas station, judging by the lighting equipment reflected on their car. About an hour in, it's revealed the father from the first half has a gun... ( ! ) He's been armed for this entire time? He shoots ( shoots at? ) The Master, then for some reason, a lesbian couple is introduced in the last scene, and it appears as though the entire plot is starting again, as this pair of girls get lost, with writer/ director/ producer/ star Harold Warren standing in for Torgo. A lame joke in the closing credits reads, \" The end? \"Yes, it is mercifully the end. \" Our sincere thanks to the city & county of El Paso for their cooperation \" I bet they just LOVE having their name attached to this one.I then shouted at the screen, \" What? \" It even has 666 in its url!",

Yet I still can't say this is the worst of the garbage pile.Manos was filmed way back in 1966 when special effects and acting were cheesy to begin with. On the other hand, what excuses do the makers of such recent tripe as The Final Sacrifice (1990), Werewolf (1996!!),  and the ever atrocious Space Mutiny (1988) have ? I have a particular gripe w/ Space Mutiny as it had the audacity of stealing special effects footage from Battlestar Galactica and staging battle scenes in an abandoned factory.

I would have trouble forcing even my most hated enemy to watch this movie. It is really, really, really bad.Did I mention they dubbed over the entire thing? Well, apparently the camera they used had no audio, so some of the worst dubbing I have ever heard was employed with a bland repetitive soundtrack commensurate with Chinese water torture.Basically, if someone says \"Hey, let's watch Manos, the Hands of Fate\" think of it as them saying \"Hey, let's go castrate ourselves with a piece of steel wool and some elbow grease.\"",

Considering the extreme limitations, it's a respectable piece of work. I saw \"Behind The Green Door\" immediately afterwards (OK, so I am going through a schlocky phase), a movie which after all made millions, is considered to be one of the foremost films of the Golden Age Of Porn and gets a fair amount of praise from cineasts, and, boy, Manos towers above it. Whereas BTGD is essentially a glorified gonzo shoot with some taped-on plot, Manos is at least a real movie, with plot, development, cheap thrills, great capes, and comelier actors (boy, that Margaret -- phew, I'm telling ya).It does of course fall short, but then so many other movies do that on a much larger budget, and with Manos you at least get a lot of enjoyment out of it -- you can bitch about it with your friends, play \"spot the gaffe\", laugh at its cheesiness. And if you're into cat fights, you've hit the mother lode, bub.See it as a labour of love -- even if it fails, at least it failed for love.NB, the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 version fills in all the slow spots with comedy and actually makes for enjoyable viewing.",

You know you shouldn't slow down to see the possible carnage, but you can't help yourself. The film has this rather puzzling quality to it. Like you can't quite believe what you're seeing. You keep watching, hoping that it either gets better or a least makes sense. IT NEVER DOES. At times you don't know who to feel more sorry for; the viewer watching it or the people who made it. They had to go into this venture with certain expectations, like what they were making was going to say something with this film. It says something allright, Like these people should have never been given access to any type of filming equipment, not even a Brownie camera. All things considered, my favorite character has to be the lovable Torgo(I still can hear the unforgettable theme music in my head).The only way that the movie was made even somewhat bearable was because of Joel Robinson and the Bots.

            "review_title": "Probably the Most Boring Horror Movie Ever Made",
            "content": "Back in the mid 1960s, a Texas fertilizer and insurance salesman named Harold P. Warren made a bet with screenwriter Stirling Silliphant (writer of In the Heat of the Night) that anyone can make a horror movie. Soon afterwards, Warren created his own horror movie on a budget of $19,000, with random people cast to play the characters, and a 16mm camera that could not record sound, causing the film to be dubbed in post. The result was Manos: The Hands of Fate (literally translated to Hands: The Hands of Fate), which despite going largely unnoticed for many years due to only playing in drive-ins and one Texas theater, it soon developed a cult following after MST3K lampooned it and turned it into a famously bad film. Me personally, I wish this film would remain obscure, for it's not even so bad it's funny, it's just pathetic.The film revolves around a vacationing family who end up getting trapped at a lodge run by a pagan cult, and they try to flee them as the cult's members decide what to do to them. Now this plot may seem really basic on paper, but with the right amount of pacing and momentum, this film could elevate its thin narrative into something with lots of substance....that is not what happened. Really, the whole movie could be cut down into 10 minutes, not only because of several insignificant scenes, but also because it drags certain moments on for no reason. There are many times when characters just stand around doing nothing even after they're done talking, and it becomes very awkward and even frustrating to watch. In addition, a whole mini plot with a couple making out in a car feels like it belongs in a completely different movie. Even an out of place catfight breaks lose with the cult master's wives, showing off pure incompetent storytelling as far as the eyes can see.Now I'm well aware that Warren could only use nobodies to play the characters, but ho'boy does nobody look like they have any idea what they're doing. Warren plays the main character Mike, and it looks like he's trying to figure out what to do on set rather than giving a performance. Same can be said about the rest, especially Mike's wife Margaret, the daughter, and the infamous Torgo. Speaking of Torgo, he's probably the most interesting character in the film from his design alone, mainly because his actor John Reynolds was high when he played the character, making his scenes hysterical but also questionable. The only other actor who seems to be having some resemblance of fun is the one playing the cult master, but he feels like a hammy cartoon villain with all the wackiness sucked out. Also, it is painfully obvious that the movie was dubbed in post, down to the young daughter clearly being voiced by a grown woman, but they had to work with what they were given, so I'm sure they tried in that aspect.Lastly, in spite of the shoe string budget, there's way too many infamous technical deficiencies to behold. Probably the biggest sin is the editing and continuity flaws, showcasing the never ending scenes and confusing side narratives that have nothing to do with anything. There's even a moment where you can clearly see the clapperboard right when the film cuts to the makeout couple. In terms of story errors, Torgo is supposed to be a satyr, so John Reynolds wore metallic rigging, but he accidentally wore it backwards which made him look more like a man with oversized knees. Also, it is never once mentioned in the film that Torgo is a satyr, so anyone watching this film will forever see him as some weird deformity. Not to mention, the soundtrack is poorly synchronized, and they even repeat the same tracks and voice recordings multiple times just to pad things out. Lastly, the whole opening showing the family driving feels like it was meant to have opening credits that were never added in, proving that the best solution would have been to trim the scene down, like the rest of the movie.Overall, Manos is a painfully incompetent and abysmal watch that can only be admired by Mystery Science Theater and RiffTrax fans for its disastrous technical failures and horrendous writing and acting. It's true what they say, nobody ever sets out to make a bad movie, and I admittedly do respect Harold P. Warren for actually making this film out of a bet, no matter how incomplete it is. Besides, plenty of filmmakers have proven to make their own successful horror movies on shoe string budgets, such as George Romero with The Living Dead series, John Carpenter with Halloween, Peter Jackson with Bad Taste, Sam Raimi with The Evil Dead, and more. However, given that those people have talent and experience in film-making, Manos is an example of why films need to be made by people who actually have some background in the techniques of crafting films, not fertilizer salesmen who make bets with Hollywood writers with a rich profile. Unless you're a cynic who adores riffing on the worst of the worst, I think Manos is better off left deep in the heart of Texas where nobody will ever seen it again.",

Two awesomely terrible actors and their test card daughter are stranded, after a driving tour of the least interesting locations on Earth, at the house of \"The Master\", complete with the funniest comedy servant of all time. Funny, that is, for all the wrong reasons. The actors's performance as \"Torgo\" is so bad he later claimed he was on LSD throughout the shoot. That I can believe. He's become something of a hero of mine. I want a Torgo t-shirt!Each scene consists of actors standing around looking as if they don't realise they are being filmed, cutting to shots of paintings, dogs, the a couple making out in a car that has nothing to do with the plot. Words cannot express the fantastic direction in this movie. If the director wasn't stoned, he surely should have been...with rocks. he can't even frame his shots properly. The plot? I just can't be bothered to mention it. Devil Worship....wrestling women...death by, er pawing, a Freddie Mercury look-alike, etc. Never mind Torgo I thought I'd taken something illegal myself by the end.Yaaay for the MS3K version.

Later we find that it's the same room where Manos (it feels ridiculous to write that every time) and his wives were hibernating. How could she not notice them!?!?! Joel & the Bots made it watchable, barely. Even they didn't have a lot of material to work with, having been reduced to saying, \"'Manos' Hands of Fate\" about 10 different times because they didn't know what else to say.I am pretty depressed right now, and this misery will probably be with me for a very long time after watching the dreaded Manos.

On a more serious, much more appreciative note, Manos the Hands of Fate deserves respect not for the film, but for the fact that this was a movie made on a whim that managed to get made, despite many setbacks. Even more surprising then it getting made, is that it got picked up by a company and was distributed to major theaters.And nowadays, the film has a large fan base. Well, I would hesitate to say it is a \"Fanbase\" seeing that many of us are dedicated to hating this movie. It is a God awful film. Though I would have to say that if it was a better film, the ending would have been seen by many as edgy (though only a year or so ahead of its time). Though it really didn't matter how it ended, because most people couldn't get through the beginning.I warned people that this movie is not for the weak. They must have thought I meant weak stomachs because they laughed it off. I have had so many people come up to me and tell me just how much they despised the movie. I guess they thought ten minutes of dialog-free driving was an exaggeration. The script was written within one week, but it's not like it's a complicated story. Family takes a wrong turn, ends up in a lodge run by a cult. It's about them trying to escape their clutches. Bad dubbing. Bad camera work. Good acting destroyed by bad dubbing. This just is a bad movie that seems to drag on forever.And I am proud to own this film. Seriously. Some movies are so bad they are good. Some are just so bad they are, well, bad.

The characters are incredibly stupid, made all the more so, because their voices were badly dubbed.As bad as it is, I'd still have to say \"Mac and Me\" (which I reviewed a couple of weeks ago) and \"Underdog\" are even worse. On the other hand, there are many reasons why \"Manos\" belongs on the #3 spot on IMDb bottom 100, one of them being that it may have even contributed to the untimely death of John Reynolds. The apparatus he wore to give him the \"goat leg\" effect (Torgo was supposedly a satyr) resulted in permanent knee damage and his subsequent addiction to painkillers. He committed suicide shortly before the film's premiere.As to being \"so bad, it's good\", Manos is too bad to be of any good. It's not fair to compare it to \"Dark Star\" or \"The Lost Skeleton of Cadavera\", two films I highly recommend. This, however is to be avoided at all costs.Rating: 1/2* out of *****",

The dubbing is bad, the editing is very rough and unpolished, the awkward silences are weird, some of the cuts are distractingly bad, a few characters (the second couple and the officers) are unnecessary given how little they do in the film, the music choices are unbearable at times, and several scenes are poorly executed. It's not hard to see why this film has such low ratings everywhere. As poorly made as it is though, I can't help but find the film interesting for a few reasons. Firstly, as a couple others have noted, the film feels like a nightmare in some respects since you're actively forgetting about the movie as you watch it. I didn't notice this when I first watched the film, but hearing this from some people caused me to appreciate the film more. I also find the story behind the film really interesting. Warren, who had no experience with directing films prior to this, got the idea to make it from a bet he made. Immediately afterwards, he began writing out the script on a napkin. Warren also ran into several hurdles while shooting the film. Most of the equipment used for the film was rented, Warren had to rush through as many shots as possible to finish the film on time, the camera he used could only record 32 seconds of footage at a time, and all sound effects and dialogue were dubbed later in post-production from Warren and a handful of other people. So, to paraphrase one of my movie buff friends, I have far more respect for Warren, who managed to create a film in spite of his inexperience and the hurdles he ran into than I do for Michael Bay, who has all the resources in the world, yet has churned out so many awful films throughout his career. If you look at the film through what's shown onscreen, you'll find a lot to criticize it for, but if you look at it through the lens of its historical context, it becomes rather interesting.",

You see, Manos was written, directed, and produced by an El Paso insurance salesman with no experience in film or acting, in order to win a bet that he could make a movie. He did this with a near zero budget, a cast of community theater volunteers and random townspeople, and the absolute minimum of editing and post-production work possible. He won his bet, but seeing the result, you'll seriously wonder if it was worth it.At least the first five minutes consist of the family driving aimlessly around the desert, passing the same amorous teenage couple again and again, in what may be the most pointless, meandering opening sequence ever put on film. Apparently, this was supposed to be a leisurely opening credits sequence, but the filmmakers ran out of money to add the credits, and just left it in to pad the runtime. It drags on and on, going nowhere, adding nothing to the story, until they finally reach the Master's house. Sadly, this brings very little improvement in plot or pacing.Instead we're mainly treated to slow, awkward conversations, aborted attempts to leave the Master's house for somewhere safer, and even more shots of that teen couple making out in their car. The closest thing this movie has to a high point is the extended catfight between the Master's nightgown clad wives, but even this gets boring after the first couple minutes. You know you're in trouble when you can't make gratuitous exploitation work.As with any bad horror movie, the characters spend far too much time wandering around looking for each other, calling out each other's names over and over with no reply. You wouldn't think it would take them so long to find each other in such a small house in the absolute middle of nowhere. Then again, it is pretty dark, and these people aren't very bright.Now the reason it's so dark is that in order to accommodate the cast and crew's day jobs, most shooting was done at night. Only they didn't have the budget for proper lighting, so most of the exterior scenes are pitch black. Hence the scene in which police hear gunshots, walk a few steps from their car to investigate, then turn around and give up because it's too dark to see anything. The lack of production values is even more apparent when one of the night scenes cuts to a piece of stock footage- instantly recognizable as such because it's better lit and photographed than any other part of the movie.If there is any redeeming value to this production beyond sheer camp, it's John Reynold's one of a kind performance as Torgo, the Master's slow talking, long suffering henchman and housekeeper. I'm not saying it's a good performance. In fact, it's about as far from anything resembling a good performance as can be imagined. But between his stilted, halting speech, jerking movements, and near constant facial tics, Reynold's acting is so awful, so creepy, in such a uniquely bizarre way, that it's almost hypnotic. Like a Beatnik version of Nic Cage, he's either manic or semi-comatose in every scene. No one could possibly be this terrible on purpose, and I was not at all surprised to learn that he was in fact a heavy drug user.The other performances are also uniformly bad, but aside from a few amusingly overwrought outbursts from the Master, only in the flat, boring manner of the entire movie. It's kind of amazing that it takes over ninety minutes for so little to happen, or that what's supposed to be a horror movie can be so utterly devoid of anything remotely scary. It does manage to be intermittently creepy, but only in all the wrong ways, as in the deeply unwholesome final scene, which I can only hope the filmmakers didn't realize the full undertones of.The whole thing is just an utter mess of earnest intentions colliding with woeful ineptitude, like Ed Wood minus the minor celebrities and special effects. It's slow, boring, disjointed, frequently bizarre, and completely botched on every imaginable level. If there is a lesson to this movie, it's that just because you can do something, it doesn't mean you should. I cannot recommend the original cut, even to the most committed bad movie lovers. However, I can recommend the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment, which makes for a rather amusing, relatively painless introduction to the cult of Manos.",

Add 1/2 cup of senselessness and a story that wouldn't be even halfway scary.  Then add one inconvenient plot device named Torgo.  Let sit for 2 hours.  Makes 8 servings.  Results are disastrous!And that was the receipe for this inane B-movie, \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\".  In this B-movie tells a story of a family going on vacation, and ending up in a house that is presided by a half-man half-satyr named Torgo and his 'Master' who has a harem of wives, and together they are a supposedly evil devil worshipping cult.  I've heard that the guy who plays Torgo killed himself shortly after this film was complete.  Also, some of the actresses and Hal P. Warren himself committed suicide after the making of this movie.  It kind of makes you wonder if those people thought it was really worth it to kill yourself over a totally bad movie.The funniest scenes of the whole movie were then the wives were in a mutual fighting frenzy, and when they sacificed Torgo and as you can see, once his hand was burned off, he ran away as if nothing happened!Manos did indeed made a hilarious MST3K episode.  In fact it's one of the favorites, too.  It's almost impossible for me to recommend this lame horror movie of disastrous porportions to anyone, unless it's watched with Joel and the 'Bots.This movie really deserved to be bashed by the crew of the Satillite of Love!

He and his friend(s) didn't intend it to be the next great movie when they made it, but he would be pleased to no end that it has become the sensation it has. He always told us that it was intended to be thought of as a \"bad grade B movie\". He kept that major painting of the master and the dog, and he kept the Master's robe (wearing it on Halloween for many years). And he did not spend his life as a fertilizer salesman in Texas, in fact, not only did he not spend much time as a fertilizer salesman, he was only in Texas a few years. the last 16 yrs were in AZ (where he died the day after Xmas 1985) On to the movie itself, I rate it a 10. It WAS slow and diffcult to follow, but from what I understood from him, it was to be done for fun and it was, and since it made it to the screen and then became almost a cult film... it deserves it. You need to see it without MST3K add-ons. Joel and whats his face ruined the ambiance of the movie, distracting and hiding things.

Okay, so they failed.\nThe plot has been covered, with various levels of competence, no need to add anything to that, just a few observations and some background. The man who played Torgo, who everyone following the MST3K version laughs at for having \"big knees\" was actually in the costume of a satyr that he had made himself. If you had seen the real version (without fake theatre seats and characters covering the bottom fourth of the screen as in MST3K) you would have seen his cloven hooves, look at any rendition of a satyr and you will see the large animal-like thigh muscles. What was being tried with the Torgo character's knees was not just out of the blue, there was a method to the madness.\nThe man who played Torgo killed himself either just before the film was released or just after (reports vary). Apparently he had trouble with drugs and came from a very strict family. And this film was the only film work of the great majority of the cast, it was their one shot and they took it.\nBut yes, the film is fun to laugh at, it is inept and scattered. But in the laughing from your safe couch where no one expects anything of you, spare a thought for the heart that went into making a picture like this. And if you want to see the worst movie ever made that no one (even , gasp, MST3K) has ever heard of, see a film called \"The Legend Of Blood Mountain\", made about the same time in the Atlanta area.\nRecommended with the proviso that you know that low-budget regional films like this are truly in a category of their own.",

I can complain about how bad the film is but that seems fairly pointless since about 1000 people have already beaten me to it and while many of their gripes are unreasonable Manos doesn't deserve to be dubbed the worst film ever. Manos actually had a decent horror story to it and I think would have made a very good horror film but it suffered from an exceedingly low budget and abysmal production. The movie was an editing nightmare with such bad camera cuts it left me asking the question, what were they thinking? There were many other examples of what to avoid in film-making. There were long, tedious shots where virtually nothing occurred; superfluous panning of the open Texas range or simply watching characters stand silent for extended intervals as Torgo (very interesting character) hobbled around. But before I deal out unreserved criticism of this film, I make note of the fact that the technical aspect of its production was doomed to disarray due to the camera. According to IMDb, Manos was \"Filmed entirely with a hand-held camera that could only record thirty-two seconds of film at a time. The film was shot without sound.\" No wonder they had such a hard time editing it. It is for this reason that the film is an editing disaster. It would be nearly impossible to produce anything remotely well with such a technical handicap. From a more conceptual perspective, Manos is an interesting idea and the film had a spooky quality to it. Like another user stated, awarding only one star to a film should be reserved for only the most inane of cinema, the kind of film that leaves the viewer angry at the sheer stupidity of the project. If you want examples, modern film-making has generously provided them. Films devoid of intelligence; movies made on large budgets, solely for monetary gain, generally just to capitalize off of some pop singer or pop culture icon (Paris Hilton for example) truly deserve the ridicule .

At least with that you can prepare for the horror. But this...holy mama of Moses. Okay, we are going to go step by step here, because that is the only way I can accurately describe how flicking horrible Manos can be:1) How about the fact that the first, oh, five hours of the movie is made up of the same damn travelogue footage of rolling hills and fields? I really felt the MST3K cast's pain as they just stared in awe at the screen saying, \"So...Manos. The Hands...of Fate. Yep.\"2) Almost all of the dialogue seems to be dubbed because none of the actors' lips match the voices. This is not a Japanese movie for crying out loud! Just re-shoot the film a bit!3) None of the characters are at all appealing. At least Batwoman had a cool costume. The wife moans and whines for her hubby, who is a jerk, and the little girl is simply grating. \"Mommy, I'm scared! Mommy, I'm cold! Mommy...\" oh kill me!4) The entire movie's soundtrack is easy-listening jazz. Yep, even the horror parts are set to the sounds of sax-a-maphones and obo-maboes. I caught snippets of an insanely high-pitched woman screaming the lyrics to some song, but she was so bad I could not understand them.5) Torgo is the movie's saving grace. With his pilloesque knees and tittering voice, he is just perfect cannon fodder for the bots and Joel. He even has his own stupid theme music! Yes!!!6) The camera work is plain awful. None of the characters are in frame half the time, which the bots point out many times.7) Oh, and here is the kicker. Most of the time the actors are seen just standing around. Just standing. Not doing anything. ARRRGH! But this does prompt the best line from Joel: Do something!8) The ending is supposed to be all cool and mysterious (they even do the God forsaken The End? gimmick after the final credits), but in execution it is just the nail in the coffin. I give Manos: The Hands of Fate 0.000000000000000000 out of 4 stars.WATCH AT YOUR OWN RISK PEOPLE!",

Well, I warn all who are planning to see this movie, do NOT do so on a full stomach, and do not attempt to operate heavy machinery afterwards.  For this is truly one of the worst movies ever made; as opposed to the much maligned \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" which at least is goofy fun.There is very little goofy about \"Manos.\"  The movie is horrible. Terrible. Awful.  Wretched.  A pox on the entire concept of cinema.  I cannot imagine possibly stomaching this movie without the help of the SOL crew.  As it is, I can rarely sit through the entire disaster in one sitting, opting to break it up.  The movie is short, and yet you will not believe how long it feels when you watch this movie.  Time seems to dialate.  It is truly incredible.I noticed a lot of people said that they \"wondered what they were thinking\" when they made \"Manos.\" Frankly, I don't want to know, for fear that whatever dreadful specter possessed the people making this movie be loosed upon us once more.  The one item of interest is the fascinating Torgo character, who for some inexplicable reason, has big knees.  He stumbles around, mumbles, and shakes.  Somehow he is also evil.  Go figure.This movie is truly a freak show; deplorable, and yet we cannot look away.",

I ponder the reasons any cast member other than Hal Warren agreed to take on such roles. Surely they read the script before hand. How could they ever think this film would be something somebody would want to watch. I've read that the city of El Paso held a gala premier for this awful film. Did they know nothing of the script or production? If one reads how actors in the film snuck out of the theatre at it's premiere, one must conclude that all involved in the production had blinders on during the making of the film. Was Hal Warren was such a feared tyrant of a director that no actor or crew member dare suggest a dialogue be reworked or a scene re-shot? Maybe the entire crew (including Hal Warren) thought they were making something great. I know nothing of Hal Warren besides his career selling fertilizer. I must admire the fact that Hal Warren somehow convinced a distributor to distribute this film and had the city of El Paso hype it up for him. I even heard he had other ideas. Maybe another effort behind the camera would have been much better as Hal Warren learned from the mistakes made in Manos The Hands of Fate. It would have been a great opportunity because the film presents every mistake a film maker can make.UPDATE 2009- I was in a low budget film produced in my hometown. Well, they only gave me the pages from the script that involved my scene. I did not get to see the rest and assumed the rest was a \"good movie\". I was wrong. It was a confusing collage of action scenes and dialogue. Maybe a few actors in \"Manos\" can explain away their participation as having been involved in a situation similar to mine. Also, my hometown hosted a grand premiere at the city's most elegant theater. I guess getting municipalities to give poor films shot within their city limits unworthy premieres is more common than most would think.",

What's wrong with the film? Repeated inexplicable silences when nothing happens, the appalling acting from Torga, the failure to make it any way frightening, it's a kind of sub-Hammer Horror film. The kissing couple who are at it for 20 hours or so, the police who are also on duty day & night, people walk in front of the camera!!.

'Manos' has a lot things that shout amatuer filmmaking -- but it successfully brings to the screen a story and yes it has a plot.  I am not going to sum this movie up like so many other people do.  The plot is simple, a family encounters something dark and horrific.  The problem that so many people have with this movie is the lame script, disasterous sound effects, the muted color, and the meandering plot.  You know what, that is comparable to a lot of people's opinions.  Say what you may, but I have seen so many \"works of artistic expression\" that are the equivalent to 'Manos.' Yet, these people were constantly lied to about how great their poem, short story, painting, etc. was.  It was the level of amatuer that kept these pieces of artistic expression from the public eye.  As stated before, 'Manos' just simply slip through the cracks.  Also, it did not try to exploit me, say like a _Gigli_ or _Batman and Robin_. 3 out of 10 stars",

It's uncommon to see an amateur film get into a cinema theater. Maybe that's the reason why it's so bad. It's like a third division soccer team playing at the first division, it's like my local basketball team playing at the NBA. It's a matter of mathematics that it will go right to the bottom. There must be lots of amateur movies even worse than Manos, but they will never be shown at a theater, so they will never be known and rated. Manos is an exception, and MST3k has a lot to do with the film's immense popularity.In a few words, I must admit that this is the worst film I have ever watched, but I also must admit that it's just an exceptional amateur movie which had a lot of luck to be picked by Joel & the Bots.",

Let's see: corpse-like emotionless acting ( except perhaps Torgo who is the best character the movie has to offer ), the worst editing I've ever seen ( and I've been editing high-school DV videos for 4 years ), audio dubbing reminiscent of old Godzilla movies, and a script that makes \"poorly-constructed\" seem insignificant, for starters. I gave it a 2 just because of the possibility that the filmmakers weren't serious and that it has maybe one or two good transitions/ideas.Plot summary: you know the drill, lost family in the desert winds up at a house where they need to spend the night with a weird housekeeper named Torgo who guards the place while the \"master\" is away. Things get worse and worse until they discover that it is home to a dark cult who worships a deity known as Manos. Throw in some bad plot deviations such as teenage romance and feminine competition... it's so fragmented it's impossible to do an accurate plot summary.Bad? Definitely. Fun to watch? Absolutely. I recommend the MST3K version though, or else you might just consider suicide, as that is exactly what 4 of the people involved in the making of this movie, including John Reynolds (Torg ) did after its release.

Mano's kept my attention and didn't really contain anything that i found annoying or disturbing. Harold p warren wasn't much of a film maker, but he somehow managed to maintain the narrative flow in this picture. he is continually throwing something at us that is freaky and/or entertaining. (albeit, i am a b film fanatic and a lover of horror films. if i see a film of this type, i WANT to like it. i TRIED to like Mano's, giving the film every benefit of the doubt, and i succeeded.) now, there is much in this movie that a film school instructor would rate as amateurish and technically inept. but within the context of Mano's, this amateurishness and incompetence WORKS. incompetent cinematography, art direction, and editing can have their charms, and in Mano's they definitely DO have their charms. Robert guider's idiosyncratic photography definitely has its charms. he shot using a hand wound sixteen millimeter camera. as a result, he comes up with some delightfully unusual effects. the film's color scheme is interesting. one could dismiss the cinematography as b movie hackwork, but that would be too cruel. the technical \"lapses\" actually help to create the funky, grungy atmosphere that is essential to the film's \"success.\" (and i contend, uncynically, that it IS a \"success.\") tom Newman designed the sets, and these are sets of a kind that one is unlikely to find in a Hollywood motion picture. the \"funky\"/\"grungy\" aesthetic of the cinematography is echoed in the set design. the film takes place in the desert, at the roadside compound of a polymerase, polytheistic cult. the members of the cult are funky, grungy people. bohemians who have chosen to live off the beaten path, in frankly offbeat surroundings. and these surroundings have a charm of their own. one might think of the master and his cult as progenitors of the Manson family. if you want to imagine what the decor in Mano's is like, imagine a compound whose rooms have been decorated by members of the Manson family. the scrappy editing adds to the fun. smooth, \"professional\" editing would not have worked on Mano's. but the rough- Hew editing of Ernie smith and James a Sullivan succeeds brilliantly. the choppy, idiosyncratic cutting seems to bring out the power in the film (or whatever power the film possesses). (Sullivan served as production manager on the \"eye creatures.\" he was the assistant director on \"zontar: the thing from Venus.\" he was unit manager on \"curse of the swamp people\" and he actually directed the john agar starred \"night fright.\" these are all \"good\" pictures, as far as i am concerned. and as far as i can ascertain, James Sullivan's contributions to these films were effective. the man knew what he was doing. even if he didn't know what he was doing, what he was doing WORKED.) all in all, the cinematography, set design, and editing of Mano's conspire to create a dark, evocative mood. think of Mano's as a \"mood piece.\" in that light, the mood that Mano's creates is an interesting one. Mano's is a funky, grungy trip to an imaginary place located somewhere in roadside America. it succeeds at what it attempts. even if it succeeds in a way unforeseen by its creators, nonetheless Mano's is a film that succeeds in creating and maintaining a distinctive atmosphere. what more should one ask of a motion picture?",

While worse than Plan 9 From Outer Space, it's still not as bad as Monster-A-Go-Go. And of course to make this movie worth watching you should watch the MST3K version.The acting is horrendous, the lighting is poor, the sound is bad, and the video a bit fuzzy. Typical for amateur, low-budget movie efforts. Also typical for low-budget movies is the plot. Travelers get lost, find a group of weirdos, then try to escape from said weirdos. Tell me you haven't heard that one before. And yet another typical amateur low-budget mistake are many scenes which seem to go nowhere, along with confusing plot lines. But you have to see the Master's wonderful cloak.Interspersed with the plot are a couple of policemen who don't seem too keen to investigate anything except for the couple who seem to be interested in making out in a sports car 24/7.If there is one bright spot in this cinematographic dungheap is that the character of Torgo really did come off as creepy. I understand reading the trivia was that the actor was on LSD at the time which caused his twitchy, out-of-it behavior. That's not to say that the part was good or that he was a good actor, though, but you really wouldn't want to spend the night with Torgo. I can understand why this movie bombed at the premier and why it's consistently been rated as one of the worst movies in history.",

            "review_title": "Calling it worst would be praise",
            "content": "After reviewing my previous statements, I have decided to write my comment from scratch.Manos: The Hands of Fate was the result of a bet, where fertilizer salesman Harold P. Warren assured that he could produce a film with an extremely small budget. What happened later has become an infamous legend.These \"moving images\" (I shall not call it \"movie\"), have a purposely plot regarding a small family of a husband, a wife and a daughter (oh, and a poodle) that are set to drive to the Valley Lodge, but are mysteriously drifting away from all known road and led into a strange semi-abandoned house. The house, as is later revealed, is inhabited by a \"Master\", who is also the leader of a polygamous cult that worships the god \"Manos\".If you have never seen it or you've only heard the stories, you'd probably think \"Hey, it can't be that bad\". \"The Premise sounds promising\". \"There must be worst movies than this one\".Well, let me say that you have thought wrong! The stories are true.I'll state that what I saw was the family friendly version (MST3K), for if someone should see it without Joel, Servo and Crow, it could cause brain damage to the poor soul who ventured.Have you ever seen a slow sequence in a movie, where nothing happens? All of those are non stop action packed compared to the opening driving of \"Manos\": 15 minutes of driving through the countryside. That's it. There are a few remarks by the lead star (Mr. Warren) saying that \"the sign pointed this way\" and some key changes in the background music, but that's the most exciting part of the whole scene. You might think that the countryside is beautiful or at least the photography is interesting. None of the above.Harold (Hal for short) P. Warren wrote the \"screenplay\", was the producer, the director and the lead star. Having said that, there are four tasks that he proved himself incompetent by far, beyond known borders.The \"script\" is the worst I have ever heard in my entire lifetime (and I thought ID4 was bad). The dialog is so repetitive that it's sickening. \"The master wouldn't approve!\" is said by Torgo (I'll get to him in a minute) at least 7 times in the same scene. And making it \"worst\" (if it would be possible), the camera couldn't pick up sound, so the voices were re dubbed by Warren and others (not the original cast).The inability of sound would make a clack board useless, as basic film-making teaches. Still, one of such boards is clearly seen in one of the scenes, swiftly leaving the frame but not edited out (nice work there. editor).As for the family's story, they're all stuck (willingly) inside a creepy house with satyr Torgo (he wears metal rigging under his legs, but somehow he put them on wrong, making his knees enormous), who \"takes care of the place while the Master is away\". Torgo's speech impediment has so many times explained the family that \"the master wouldn't approve\" their presence. He inconspicuously reveals to the mother his feelings towards her. He tries to grope her hair, making it one of many disturbing scenes found abroad.There is so much to say about this colossal anti-epic, there is not enough paper in the world to write a review worthy of it. You do feel horror, but not for the \"scary\" sequences. Calling it worst would be praise. If you look for \"incompetent\" in the dictionary, you will find the poster for \"Manos\". The background music, including the \"haunting Torgo theme\", is mind numbing and stressing, sounding like Antonio Carlos Jobim's worst nightmare. The scream \"Mike, Mike!\" coming from the woman playing the wife, is the worst piece of acting I have ever witnessed. So many movies are bad, so many movies are worse, only one is the worst of them all. It makes all porn scripts seem like literary classics. It makes \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" the equivalent to \"The Godfather\". It makes \"Gigli\" Oscar worthy. It makes \"Ballistic\" the greatest action movie ever made.As much as I hate to admit it, it has grown on me. You may be shocked to read this: I LOVE IT!!!!!. But, some may wonder \"if he loves it so much, why doesn't he rate it 10?\" Well, I may be crazy, but I'm not stupid. \"Manos\" deserves a -100, and the only reason I give it a 1 is because it's the lowest rating in IMDb you can give.So many big-budget no plot movies have been said to be the worst ever. Whoever says this obviously looks away to certain redeemable aspects of the movie. Whether it had good actors, a good story that was handled carelessly, a nice musical score, state of the art visual effects, a particular sequence that you enjoyed, good camera work, something. \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" has none. Seriously. No effort was put into this thing to make it work, either as a horror, suspense thriller or any kind of movie. Nothing! If someone has called you a mediocre director, a wannabe writer, a failure as a producer, a charmless actor or something similar, whoever has called you that obviously has never seen or heard about \"Manos\" (and lived to tell the tale).If you're still skeptical, if you think you can handle it, if you just can't believe a movie is so bad or if you're a masochist who knows what he's going for, then there's no other choice to you than seeing it. But, one last warning, it's not for the faint of heart, stomach or brain, and it Will leave you scarred (and that's with the MST3K version).",

The painfully obvious continuity errors, the awful overdubbing (which was supposedly done my three people - voicing all the actors in the film), the abysmal acting and the fact that the film is a complete bore (despite its runtime of just over an hour).I mean, this film isn't even worthy of a 'so-bad-it's-good' status. It really is that bad.However, the Torgo character is definitely intriguing especially after reading up on John Reynolds (the actor who plays Torgo) which explained many things about his character.Overall, I think Manos is better studied than enjoyed since the latter is virtually impossible.1/10",

I work in a theater and see films for free on the big screen on opening night (or later if the former statement is not possible). I've even come to appreciate Steven Seagal's career as a result of Manos.It isn't possible to explain WHY it's such a bad movie, I guess the only real purpose of this review is to help put Manos back on the top of the worst 100 list.

Now, to describe the plot......... um, well, there's this guy driving forever and he's supposed to be doing something.  Then, there's this LSD-driven \"guy\" who has big knees, and he kind of interacts with this black robed Frank Zappa, who happens to have a dozen or so \"wives\" who wear next to nothing and tend to get into big mud-wrestling brawls.

            "content": "...in that blurry color and 16mm film are used, and that the plot makes no sense unless you read the director's comments on the film. The only problem with \"Manos\" is that one-shot director Harold P. Warren thought that the film spoke for itself. I mean, it should: a 1966 family is out on vacation in their black `65 Ford. Dad can't find the Texas hotel they have reservations at, Mom can't read a map, the daughter terrorizes the family poodle the whole way there. After meandering around an empty field they find a small, cheaply painted sign: \"Valley Lodge.\" The follow the rutted path until they come upon a tiny ranch house managed by this greasy white guy in a floppy hat and mechanic's overalls. This is Torgo, the stuttering and squeeky-voiced servant of the Master, who isn't seen until the final reel. From then on, the movie sticks with every devil-cult movie cliche known to man: the car won't start, the dog is killed mysteriously, somehow the couple stumbles on to the ceremonial area used by the cult, a Satanic religious service is shown, people are killed, and the family never leaves. There is also some sleaze with Torgo wanting Warren's screen wife because the Master (who wears a massive black cape with red hands and resembles Bill Buckner) has a harem, collected God knows how. This sort of tired stuff can work (See the Karloff and Lugosi flick \"The Black Cat\" for proof) if the right atmosphere is struck, if the acting is right, and if the beginning is slightly plausible. The vibe \"Manos' gives off at the start is like an educational film on freeways or farming, though the viewer could think they have stumbled on to a real snuff film. Having all the voices dubbed by three people also breaks the atmosphere, as does repeating lines, the background score (either canned music, or people noodling on pianos, guitars, and flutes), and the overlit set. Certainly the place is grimy enough to be a horror movie set, but it looks like what it is, the guest house of a ranch. Besides all these other defects, the pacing is totally shot, and plot-holes abound (Why don't they notice that the Master is sleeping on a rock in the back yard until night? Why does Hal have a gun?)Some final jabs: Only the guy who played Torgo killed himself, and that was an O.D. \"Manos\" did play at a movie theater in El Paso (around which the film was shot) and the cast sneaked out on the opening night afraid to face their friends in the audience, who were laughing their heads off. Warren died before the movie was torn to shreds by MST3K. He did want to redub the movie as a joke, but it went out on a nationwide run (which probably lasted two weeks) as it was before sinking into oblivion.Personally, I don't know who is the worst director: Hal Warren, Ed Wood, Coleman Francis, Bill Rebane, or the guy who shot \"Battlefield: Earth.\"",

I won't spoil it for those who may not have seen it, but things go downhill for the family after they decide to stay for the night. No matter how bad the film is, the ending is actually somewhat clever and will make you cringe a little. Aside from the ending, however, this is no doubt the worst film ever produced, even worse than Plan 9 From Outer Space. The movie was apparently shot with a cheap store-bought camera and does look like someone's bizarre home movies. In the beginning, there is an extended sequence of the family driving through the country, past farms, fields, and rural houses; you get the feeling the director is just filming his friends' real estate as a favor for them. Despite its cheapness, you actually won't forget this film after it is over, it is so bad; the Torgo character also is quite memorable.Don't think Manos is a film so bad you should pass on it; watch it if you get the chance, but watch it as a comedy and not a horror film.",

So, I put forth the hypothesis that all involved actually worshiped a god called Manos and that the movie was intended to enlist others into their religion to appease the will of Manos and that Hal Warran actually IS the Master. It's conceivable. This interpretation nonetheless adds a rather disturbing aspect while watching the movie. In any case, MasTER mUSt BE serVED or MasTER WIll be ANGry.I think my two favorite parts are the extended \"Torgo Carries Suitcases from the Car\" and the smooth \"Torgo Busts a Move on the Chick\" scenes. I start laughing so hard when I see those that my body actually hurts.",

They invite themselves to stay at a lodge they come across. They soon discover that this is no ordinary place and that the master is not some memory recalled by Torgo. It's very hard to describe in detail the train-wreck that arises in this film, I can't emphasize just how bad the camera shots were and how bad the acting in general was.Also the cop and the teenagers scenes didn't really serve any purpose, the cop never came to the rescue, so why have him keep popping up?

            "content": "I don't hate Manos, I enjoy watching it from a different point of view. I like seeing just how bad it is and think that while many of today's movies are bad, they still PALE in comparison to Manos. I wouldn't tell anyone not to watch it, but to be prepared for how bad it is. Movies like Star Paws it one I would tell people to steer clear of.I see a lot of reviews that compare this movie to Plan 9 From Outer Space and while both movies are quite bad, Plan 9 at least had some kind of coherence. What we find with Manos is a complete lack of vision and the inability to plan things properly. This movie literally plays out like something a bunch of kids filmed on a whim after getting their hands on their parent's video camera. I'm sure working on it made everyone feel important, but the end result was far from it.Plan 9, while also a very bad movie, at least showed that the cast and crew had some kind of knowledge of film making. The story's continuity holds firm through the entire movie and despite ridiculous dialogue, you get the base idea that aliens are trying to contact people of Earth so they can be halted in their advances of technology and eventually destroying the universe, throwing in the \"zombie apocalypse\" seemed very out of place, but the idea was so far out of left field that it has a bit of charm itself. The sets were bad (plywood for airplane yokes?), strings were visible, and it didn't actually star Bella Legosi, but you could get a sense of competence and that everyone was at least trying.Plot:\nManos, on the other hand, suffers badly from the director/producer's inability to envision the world in which his story takes place. Plot holes are almost non-existant because the entire movie is a plot hole. There is zero exposition or any explanation for anything that happens. While this can work for a movie when done right, in this case it just leaves you scratching your head and asking questions you will never get answers to. Why did the family get lost when the sign literally pointed to their destination? Who is Manos? Why did the master have so many wives? Did Peppy just fake his death to get out of filming? The plot is all over the place and it makes watching the movie difficult.The director has no sense of timing, leaving scenes going on far longer than they should and improperly editing said scenes to shorten them (everyone makes a comment about the driving at the beginning), but other scenes like when the sheriff is telling the \"kids\" to get lost and the camera just sits there staring at the girl as she does her hair and THEN she turns to the camera and delivers her line. It goes on like this through the entire movie.I like the random events like the kid just running off into the dark and Mike having a loaded pistol in the glove box of the car, it really makes for excellent things to talk about with people!Oddly, the only continuity that holds up in the entire movie is that the car really did have a taillight out at the beginning of the movie. I personally didn't notice it until I watched the restored blu-ray version and could actually see the movie.Dialogue:\nI love the confusing dialogue. One of the best is Torgo himself when he keeps repeating his lines (actually, most of the actors do that). I also enjoy the scene toward the beginning where Torgo is unloading the bags from the car while he's explaining that the family can't stay there (the master would not approve), but he just continues to take the luggage in and protest that they have to leave, it's so very confusing. Since all the dialogue is dubbed, everyone's lines just come off as wooden and boring. The Master's laugh is hilariously bad too, so weak and unimposing.Characters:\nEvery character in this movie is an idiot and annoying. The only real enjoyable person is Torgo, even as confusing and strange as he is, but most of that can be chalked up to the actor being on drugs and wearing the leg prosthetics wrong which caused him pain. Mike is a downright a-hole and I wonder if that's how he is in real life (since he is also the director), it would seem fitting. The Master looks intimidating, but is strangely not very scary at all. I think it's his facial structure that worked, too bad the actor couldn't convey any kind of intimidating manner. Sharron is just inept and the typical whiner, always complaining about something (I suppose some of it is warranted, like not wanting to stay at the house).Music:\nHo-boy... the music is something else. It's not bad, it's not good and it does more harm than good. Almost none of it sets the mood properly, being that it's almost all a single piano. The only music that works is for Torgo's walk (I'm assuming an obo or flute of some kind). It really makes the whole scene worth watching.Overall, it's only to be watched if you want something humorous to enjoy. Just don't expect to understand what's going on.",

However, there is something about this movie, that you can't turn away from the film in all it's horror.  It somehow appears to be a \"snuff film,\" I don't know if such movies exist, but Manos: Hands of Fate is a good piece of evidence that it does.Once I learned that the actors who played the Mother, the Kissing Girl, and Torgo had all committed suicide the same year the movie was made, I was freaked out.  You almost think that the whole cult and sacrifice is probably real.  It's probably not true, but watching the movie with a viewpoint that these people are filming a documentary about their cult gives you a whole other feeling, one of unsettling curiosity.  Hey, maybe this movie could be considered the father (or Master) of \"Blair Witch Project\"!Maybe I'm just crazy.  Probably the whole reason this movie was made was so we could see the Master's brides wrestle in diaphonous gowns.  Despite the wretchedness of the movie, Torgo is an incredibly unforgettable character. You can't help but think of what his ambitions, goals, and motivation.  Once you really dig deep down in his character, you realize how disgusting it is, and try to free yourself from the grossness of it all.Final word of caution: don't watch without Joel and the Bots.Long Live Torgo!",

I find it hard to believe that so many people were able to sit through this unforgivable mess, even with the MST3K commentary! Furthermore, I find it impossible to believe that anyone actually liked it! 541 people thought this was great? You fools! That's like drinking hemlock and calling it Koolaid! I am not exaggerating here, there has never been a movie worse than this. Some say that GIGLI is the worst movie ever made, but they are simply overreacting to a fresh stinker (I mean Ben Afflec and Lopez are irritating and all, but they could never make a movie worse than this!). I am voting in to tip the scales and put this trash on the bottom where it belongs.The film opens with a seemingly endless series of establishing shots that are so lifeless, it would be a compliment to call them 2 dimensional. After what feels like 20 minutes of boring travel, our heroes: a couple, their daughter, and a dog, come to a house in the middle of nowhere. That's when we meet the freak Torgo, who has giant kneecaps. The husband talks to him asking if they can stay the night. Sounds simple enough, right? They can't even finish a simple sentence without stumbling and pausing for small eternities! They are allowed to stay and the \"horror\" unfolds very slowly. Later we meet The Master, who wears a cape with hands on it as he worships Manos (which means hands, making the title a pathetic redundancy). The Master has wives who wrestle for his favor in nightgowns. All of it is presented in static shots, on very low quality film, which are all held for too long. The dialogue, acting, design, script, direction, music, photography, you name it, it all stinks! In fact, it is all the absolute worst it can be. The movie is such an enormous failure, one wonders if they were even trying. It all builds to a weak horror-movie conclusion and the mercifully ends. The 74 minutes it takes to watch it feels like about five hours.This movie makes PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE seem like CITIZEN KANE. I myself am one who can enjoy a movie when its bad enough (why else would I watch MST3K?), but this thing is just too terrible to enjoy, on any level. The only reason to watch the MST is to hear the comments, which still don't protect you from the utter pain of viewing the movie. MANOS  is a one of a kind pain, rivaled only by THE INCREDIBLY STRANGE CREATURES WHO STOPPED LIVING AND BECAME MIXED UP ZOMBIES. The film, the director, the actors, and the entire crew should have been publicly burned for this crime against the cinema. It doesn't get any worse than this!",

A strange man is a keeper, named Torgo, who has deformed legs and walks and talks like he's drunk all the time. The family decides to stay over for some reason. Eventually hijinks occur, and we the viewer are set to suffer some of the most horrible film making ever unleashed. Some crap happens in small, lighted locations in the desert. There's some guy with some stupid cape on, and he's the \"master\" and he has his wives. Most of the film is simply actors moving about these filming locations, coming and going out of frame. Some other crap happens and that's about it.This could possibly be the worst movie ever made. Challengers, and IMO an upper hand still belongs to Laserblast even though it's ranked higher. The Barbaric Beast of Boggy Creek series definitely can hang with Manos as well. At any rate there's really no point in arguing which is worst. They are all absolutely horrid and terrible, each shining through in perhaps it's unique form of ugliness.

I, having a strong stomach and willpower, can sit through any assault on my senses as long as the MST3K buffer is there. This was the ONE exception. I had to stop halfway through and allow myself 24 hours to mentally recover before bravely pushing the play button again. I think even Mr. Ed Wood would have been too embarrassed to release this waste of perfectly good film. \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" look like Citizen Kane compared to this turkey.Obviously from these other reviews, there is a deranged, almost indecipherable plot, no-talent acting, extremely bad acting and the real kicker: the whole film was shot out-of focus and almost no lighting! It actually hurt my eyes to watch it! Even Plan 9 was in focus! What really made me question my sanity was the soundtrack. The bulk of the music(?) sounded like a jazz pianist and clarinet player noodling around for an hour! To this day, I have nightmares about this movie. Not because of the evil dude with the iron-on hands on his zippered, polyester costume, and not because of the skeevy, one-too-many-sessions-on-the-stairmaster Torgo. I have nightmares because it was so bad, that not even the geniuses at Best Brains could save it. It was physically painful, and should be considered by the chinese as a new form of mental torture. I realize that one should not expect Scorcese-like quality from a director who was really a full-time fertilizer salesman, but gez...I think a retarded slug could have made something a little more palatable.",

It is so incredibly bad that if it were broadcast on every channel in the world simultaneously, non-stop around the clock, it would have succeeded in breaking the will of every human being on Earth and forced them to obey the one man capable of turning it off: Clayton Forrester! This movie should have been the final episode of MST3K in which Mike/Joel/Crow/Servo's will is finally and permanently destroyed and they bow before Dr. Forrester and beg him to end the movie (Crow's line's lifted from 'Aliens' during this episode \"Game over man, game over!\"). Thus the series should have ended with Dr. F. sitting in a throne wearing 'the Master's robe with T.V.'s Frank beside him holding the Torgo staff in his hands and stock footage of various people bowing in worship. If anyone that has actually seen this film thinks they have found one even worse please post it's name here so that I, and everyone else, can be forewarned of the potential terrors that lie behind that seemingly harmless Blockbuster rental that exists in our future.P.S. Vote to make 'Manos' #1 on the bottom 100!",

            "content": "\"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" is one of the greatest, and most maligned films of all time.As an avid B-movie and Z-movie fan, \"Manos: the Hands of Fate\" is the holy grail. Never before and probably never again will there ever be a film as ineptly \"bad\" as \"Manos\". Literally everything about the film, when judging by normal film standards, is done wrong. But you already know this. It's safe to say that if you are looking at this review, you know \"Manos\" well and are completely aware of the film and the situations in which it was made. However, I am arguing for the value of this film.While I am certainly biased because I am a fan of this film and have seen it dozens of times, this film is a great example of what movies are supposed to do. Like it or not, this is one of the most entertaining films of all time. I think just about anyone who has seen this film has laughed at least once or twice during the viewing, especially if you are viewing it with friends or even better in a theater full of people. The mistakes are glaring and the scenes become so iconic that they stay in your head forever. Whether it be the first time we meet Torgo, the Master's wives fighting in the sand, or the epic (if you can call it that) finale with an unhappy ending (rare for a B or Z movie of the time), \"Manos\" is a film you will remember. Sure, it is \"terrible\" but with enough viewings, it becomes an endearing film. And these days, with most of the trash coming out of Hollywood being passed as \"entertainment\", a little bit of cheese and a little less seriousness is something that we could use.",

However, there is depth and metaphor in this divinely-crafted piece of art, which you will find nowhere else. If you ignore the misguided and uneducated popular opinion long enough to treat yourself to this gem, you will be rewarded for years to come. It is perhaps the most disturbing psychological thriller ever made.Although, at first glance, elements like the protracted cuts of the car driving through the desert seem to be gratuitous incompetence on the part of director Hal Warren, they are actually expertly calculated devices designed to engender unparalleled tension (I felt like I was actually experiencing the horrific events myself). What is considered \"bad acting\" and boring, inane dialogue by most, is in fact Warren's almost supernatural ability to weave a sense of ultra-realism from his supremely skilled thespians. The delicious set design and cinematography are gothically postmodern, conveying an atmosphere of impending dread. Last but not least, kudos of kudos must be given to the brilliant score, particularly the haunting, minimalistic \"Torgo\" theme. All of these components converge to yield a profoundly subtle epic, a superlative achievement in innovative film-making - in short, one of the greatest films ever made. I could tell you more, but I don't wish to spoil a second of this masterpiece, nor its climactic twist, which would turn M. Night Shaymalan green with envy.God rest your soul, Hal Warren. One can only imagine what other cinematic wonders you would have blessed us with if only your uncanny genius had been recognized and appreciated.

Once the master \"awakens\" we come to realize he has six wives, and is after the mom to make number 7. Why you ask... who the heck knows. The plot is so messed up that we don't know who/what/or why concerning the master. Plus, Torgo gets a mind of his own and decides he wants the mom as his wife. These so called wives, when awake, fight as to whether the child (a girl) should live and become the master's wife or die. I could go on for hours, but I simply love this movie because it is so horrible. And who could forget the relentless driving scenes where all you see are fields and grass.

Even when Torgo makes a pass at the female lead, it seems like a minute before she reacts. If someone had edited big chunks out of this film to get the story moving a bit more snappily, it would have been a quickly forgotten cheapo B-Movie, but the released version really does deserve its appalling reputation.In addition, the Master looks rather too much like Arthur Bostrom's gendarme from 'Allo allo' to be particularly menacing.

In that episode, a movie camera AND film were discovered in a sealed box in the lagoon.  The castaways went on to make a flick and then put the work adrift on a raft in the hopes it would be found and lead to a rescue.  The film was found and went on to win first prize at Cannes!  Needless to say, the castaways remained stranded.  The parallels between 'Manos' and the inspiration are clear: Hal Warren hoped this film would be discovered and would lead him to fame and ultimately, a rescue from EL Paso, TX.  As with his inspiration, however, his film WAS discovered, albeit not until many years later, and Roach was left to his fate in El Paso.  There was to be no rescue. \nI can't comment on the story or the acting because whatever story there is/was has been chewed to bits by the absence of direction and cinematography.  Nevertheless, when you sit and watch this film, you become riveted as you realize you are watching history.Seriously, I would not be surprised to see a modern-day feature any time now which chronicles the making of and release of this film.

This is a movie where somehow, in some way, the people working on it managed to do EVERYTHING wrong.Acting? Horrible. Costumes? Laughable. Lighting? Umm...What lighting? For the love of God, the film and camera used were even of sub-standard quality (and I mean by 1966 standards, not modern day)! This movie reminds me more than anything else of when a loving parent goes to their son/daughter's third grade play and video tapes it. Except the plot to that play is probably a lot more coherent, less disturbing, and the acting is only slightly worse. That is no exaggeration.I can't really sumarize this movie since it doesn't really seem to go anywhere. A lot of it is downright confusing. There are several scenes of a young couple kissing that could just as well have been from another movie for all the impact they had on this one. Torgo, the only memorable character, has been given the sinister affliction of gigantic thighs. It seems he was intended to be some sort of goat-man, but that isn't really explained and isn't readily obvious. His death scene looks more like a massage than a brutal beating. Worst of all, in the end, our heroes (such as they are) fail to escape from Torgo's creepy Master, sending the uplifting message that evil pagan gods always win in the end. The final scenes of the movie also hint at pedophilia.For all of the cast members, as well as the writer/director and I imagine the greater portion of the crew, this was to be their first and only film. A sequel is hinted at in the final credits, but thank goodness it was never made.I have been trying and trying to come up with some explanation for how this movie got released in theaters. So far, the only one that made sense to me is that Satan himself appeared before the studio executives and made some kind of payoff. This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen, and although I have yet to see Plan 9 From Outer Space! (though not for lack of trying) I cannot imagine how it could exceed Manos in failure.I should mention I saw only the MST3K version of this movie. I cannot imagine sitting through the uncut version.

Well, that's bad enough, but they apparently do this by stuffing the knees of his pants with cloth.The movie has a rather long scene of women wresting in the sand in white robes.  It may be the high point of the movie, but it still is a low point in moviemaking.  The women wresting isn't titilating at all, just in case this might have enticed you to watch.The shots are poorly framed, with characters often only halfway on the screen.

            "content": "I saw \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" on what is probably the most famous episode of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" (or \"MST 3K\" for short). That show showcases bad movies and manages to make them watchable thanks to a host and his robot friends constantly making fun of them, but this particular movie was almost beyond saving even for \"MST 3K.\" Anyone who thinks that many filmmakers in mainstream Hollywood today are inept should probably take a look at \"Manos.\" I didn't think it was possible to get absolutely everything wrong while making a film, but the people responsible for this movie managed to do it. The whole thing was shot by a camera that not only couldn't record sound, but couldn't even shoot more than thirty seconds of footage at one time. As a result there are countless clumsy jump cuts, continuity errors, and dialog that was (very badly) dubbed in later by only three people. When you combine that with horrible cinematography, limited lighting, ugly sets, uglier music, and repetitive dialog you get what probably deserves to be called one of the worst movies ever made.Despite all of these shortcomings, \"Manos\" has gained something of a cult following among fans of so-bad-they're-good movies. While I wouldn't go as far as to call myself a fan of this movie, I can kind of see why it would have such a following. There is a certain charm to this film that suggests that everyone involved was really trying their best to come up with something good (they were just really bad at it, so they failed miserably). The plot, which centers on a lost family stopping at a lodge in the middle of nowhere and being tormented by its mystical \"master\" and his (oddly likable) satyr henchman, probably would've been salvageable in the hands of the right filmmakers. There's also a somewhat creepy atmosphere that almost makes itself felt through the film's shortcomings. Sadly, it isn't enough to save this mess (only enough so that I can give it a score of two out of ten instead of a one).If nothing else, I can honestly say that \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" is one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen. I don't know if I could recommend it to anybody that I would consider a friend. I would tell them to watch the \"MST 3K\" version though, if only because it proves my theory that that particular show is at its best when the movies are at their worst.",

Was it abysmal, such a Technicolor abortion that it warranted the lowest score possible? I don't think so. This film, though...Let me make something clear right now: I've only seen the MST3K version like most sane people. I couldn't put myself through the unedited version, though I tried the next best thing and just tuned the bots out. What you have left is a script that is just awful all across the board: dialogue comes off as either cheesy, hokey, or stupid. The characters are either stereotypes or make no sense, with the exception of the servant Torgo, who is purely by accident one of the funniest things ever to happen to movies. And of course, there's the cinematography, using the word in the loosest sense possible. The film was shot with an antique camera that could only record 60 seconds of film at a time, sound not included, and couldn't be moved. The results are just about what you'd expect from a fertilizer salesman trying to edit together an ungodly amount of 60 second clips; jerky, boring, and bad bad bad.The story was pretty unamazing by itself. A family gets lost, finds a house/hotel/thing, and winds up right in the middle of a cult. THat's about the extent of what you get; continuity and cohesion go strait out the window here, and what little plot there is gets split up between scenes of The Brave Father trying to be brave but coming off as a clueless pecker-head, the Evil Villain being Evil, or some other mishmash. The \"surprise ending\" is laughable; by the time you hit it, you're just glad its over.Look for three scenes in this flick: anything with Torgo in it, the gigantic cat-fight whose only plot purpose was to have fairly attractive women fight on screen while Torgo leers Torgoishly, and a scene where two officers of the law \"investigate\" the situation. UNfortunately, because the camera couldn't be moved, the \"investigation\" consists of three steps taken away from the car and a resoundingly satisfactory \"Well, things seem okay here\" from Cop Number One.The Trivia section speaks for the rest. The voices were done by two people, no one got paid, and Torgo committed suicide after this was released. I can understand hyperbole, I can realize that yes, there are some truly bad movies out there today, but this one takes the cake. The true Worst Movie of All Time, saved only by a little show called Mystery Science Theatre 3000, where even with the nonstop jibes, the movie is still rough. If you feel, however, you must watch it, get some popcorn, strap yourself in, and see if you can survive the (non-existant) opening credits. You'll see what I mean.",

What a shocker. I think that I'd commit suicide too if I'd been in something this grotesquely hideous, especially knowing that it would be foisted off on an innocent public as a means of torture. The horror begins with a long, LONG shot of a pompous jerk weed, his wife, daughter and poodle all taking a vacation in Texas. The film appears to have been left out in the sun for several months, degrading it to a nearly unwatchable quality. They get stopped briefly by a cop, and one person does the voice work for both men. Talk about saving money...Although that's still not as bad as the shrill, weird voice slapped on the couple's little daughter. She sounds like she might be possessed like the girl in the Exorcist. They're looking for a hotel which is apparently down a road in the middle of nowhere. The hubby is such a cheap skate that he won't pay for a better hotel somewhere nearer to civilization. And didn't either of them wonder why any kind of hotel would have a HAND PAINTED sign put up beside a dirt road?!Oh, well. It's getting dark - or the film is giving out entirely - so they stop at a weird house in the middle of nowhere and talk the caretaker into letting them stay the night. Torgo's gotta be the best character in the film, with his collection of facial ticks, his odd speaking voice, and his huge thighs that are apparently what tell people that he's evil. And these idiots decide to stay here WHY?! Ah, well. They're perfect victims, anyway.Enter the master, a skinny be-mustached moron in a caftan with red hands sewn on it and a staff that looks like a rusty tail pipe. This guy's about as scary as a gas station attendant. In fact, I've seen creepier gas station attendants...he has half a dozen 'wives', a bunch of women who run around in their underwear when they aren't wrestling each other. As Tom Servo notes: \"I think this is the whole reason that this movie was made, right here...\" as he watches the 'full contact nightgown wrestling'. Torgo wants the wife so that he can fondle her in his own inimitable way. Hubby is arrogant, stupid and useless, making you want to slap him repeatedly. Espciallyt since this oily jerk is actually the director and writer of this horrid piece of trash, as well. The Master makes a lot of faux mystical statements and spends most of his time yelling at his wives, which is what he gets for marrying so many. Torgo gets killed, which is a shame. The nightgowned women and their Lord and Master;) run around looking for the couple and their daughter so that he can marry her as well(perhaps this is a weird form of Mormonism?). And the little girl's poodle apparently dies from strychnine poisoning, since its body is stiff as a board. And the movie just goes on, and on, and on..or so it seems. It seems to take hours to watch it, rather than the standard hour and a half. And I break out in a cold sweat when I imagine the fifteen minutes of cut out footage that was removed when MST3K made it over for their show. Since the characters like to repeat themselves several times with every statement that they make, perhaps all of that footage is them saying things again and again...ARRGHH! The horror!

            "content": "As a fan of Mystery Science Theatre 3000, i got to say that manos is a very terrible movie, even worse than Deuce Bigalow, European Gigolo.Directed by Hal Warren, this movie is about a happy unit Margaret, Michael & Debbie who are on a road trip when their luck takes a turn for the worse. No, not a family of mutant cannibals, but lots of driving does bring them to the front door of a forsaken lodge. Torgo lingers in the doorway, acting like a mentally challenged freak. Tired after a long day on the road, dad says, \"Gee, this place looks like a good place to spend the night.\" He instructs the creepy caretaker to carry the family's bags inside.Meanwhile, the two smooches are discovered by the roaming policemen and told to move along. This turns into a running gag, with the amorous pair kissing, drinking, and eventually leaving when the officers find the latest roadside love nest. Have you ever kissed someone with several hours of cheap whiskey on their breath? Not the best way to get in the mood.Inside the lodge is a depiction of the Master and his faithful Doberman. Mike and Margaret spend what seems like (and nearly is) ten minutes obsessing about the painting. They are frightened by the aura of menace that surrounds the canvas. These two should try looking through a book of Giger's artwork (which, by the way, makes a great baby shower present).That night, Mike investigates chilling howls near the house and an unseen creature kills the family poodle. Then the luckless father discovers the Master's desert shrine. The priest lies upon a stone altar, while his women decorate nearby pillars. All of this is too much for Mike; he runs back to the lodge with every intention of leaving.Torgo has been using the idle time to chat up Mrs. Useless. He obsesses about the Master and his wives, angry that the polygamous pontiff wants the newest female arrival for his own. The Master wakes after these revelations, so perhaps the servant is telepathically bonded. You know what? I do not care. I want this movie to be over.The Master rouses all of his wives at the same time, which only proves to me that he is some sort of freaking idiot. The women immediately start arguing and, eventually, fighting over the fate of their guests; the disposition of Debbie seems to be a major point. One wife refuses to harm the child in any way. The debate spirals into chaos as slaps and sharp fingernails start flying. The fight lasts for about twenty minutes.Elsewhere, the Master has a stare-off with Torgo. The idiot (that would be Torgo) loses and is consigned to death. The priest has to stop his consorts' battle royal en progress (thank goodness), but soon the dissenting wife and Torgo are tied up and ready for slaughter.Speaking of staring, if I was a goldfish and could not blink, this movie would be the death of me.Failing to start the car, Mike is forced to drag his wife and child into the desert. They get absolutely nowhere. Clear night, not too bad terrain, and the bozo cannot lead them to safety. Look for a glow on the horizon or find Polaris and get your bearings, you worthless sack of flesh! I refuse to believe that we are the same species. Mein Gott! Mr. Useless eventually gives up and settles on the bright idea of hiding at the Master's house. Soon the cleric of Manos has them in his power, despite Mike's revolver (useless, just like its owner).Now that's the ending. Sad isn't it. That's why Hal Warren, the genius fertilizer salesman made this movie and inspired filmmakers like Bob Clarke & Uwe Boll to make movies more worse that they should have a MST3K treatment.

There is not one single thing this film has going for it. The music seem more appropriate for a third-rate dance routine. The acting is best described as constipated. The cinematography is horrendous. The plot (a family checks into a satanic lodge and a whole bunch of nothing happens) makes no sense. The protagonists are bland and unlikable. The antagonists are hammy and impossible to take seriously. Torgo provides a few fleeting laughs but he is ultimately as repugnant as the rest of the films.To add insult to injury, there are implications of rape, necrophilia, and pedophilia. So not only is this film bad and impossible to enjoy but it is also unpleasant and sleazy. What stoned insane masochist could find this film entertaining? This only serves as a cautionary tale of what not to when making a movie. For example, don't make a film just because you were bet into it like Hal Warren, this film's actor and supposed \"hero\", did. Ambition often exceeds actual talent.The MST 3K version hilariously tears this film a new and makes the flaws even more apparent as if that were possible. View this version only for the sake of your time and sanity.",

Ed Wood would have sold his angora soul to make a movie this horrible.  There is no plot in the normal sense of the word (as in a sequence of events driving a storyline from beginning to end); rather, the movie seems to try to build a frightening mood throughout.  This is undermined by the fact that Manos looks an awful lot like Frank Zappa and I was waiting for him to break into \"St. Alfonso's Pancake Breakfast\" every time he popped up on screen.  Add to this that whatever special effects there are seem more likely to have been produced by Home Depot than Industrial Light and Magic and you get the general idea that this was a last ditch effort to get a 'D' in film school and avoid giving back the grant money. The only saving grace to the film is that Shields & Yarnell are nowhere to be found in it.",

That is the extent of the plot, and while a simple plot doesn't kill a movie immediately (Mad Max Fury Road had a simple plot) but it takes talent to execute it effectively. None of the heroes are worth rooting for, the father played by Harold P Warren comes across as an jerk who ends up dooming his family in the end. The only likable character is the supporting villain Torgo mostly due to the entertainment value he brings. Yet even he can't save the movie from being horrible. Many people enjoy the film in a so bad it's good way because of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I'll admit the riff track is hilarious and very entertaining. But I have noticed that if you try and watch the movie by itself, it's cringeworthy. The audio is terrible even for the 60's, the shots go on forever, most of the actors aren't even trying.

It is as if the person editing this film had never seen a movie before.Worst Directing Ever - Everything about this film is unconvincing, but the action is laughable.

Policeman investigating the sound of shooting walk about 2 feet forward and then conclude their investigation has turned up nothing. And ON and ON.... I have never seen a movie in which no one seems to move - its as if everyone has been directed to stand on their spots and not leave them during a scene.Worst screenplay - When the family isn't caught up in the evil goings-on, the Mom and Dad stand in front of a painting and just talk about it. Then some action occurs, and after its over -Mom and Dad return to the painting and talk about it. And then the cycle repeats again. And speaking of deja vu cycles, the movie has several scenes that it keeps repeating. Worst costuming - Torgo and his deformed legs are now a cinematic legend. But there are also the wives of the Master, dressed in ways totally inappropriate to their action.Worst acting awards - Some of the acting is world-class bad in Manos, but I don't believe that this is the worst acting ever. The actor playing Torgo actually does create a sense of character. Most of the actors and actresses are done in by the \"Worst Directing Ever\" (I can't say that enough.)

Torgo had skills in acting, and I wont deny him anything. He made his own braces for his legs, so that he would walk funny, rather than just having huge knees. But he didnt do his own voice.The whole film was shot silently and then redubbed. The only people that dubbed in their own voices were Mike, Margaret, The Master, and the Wives. Im sad that the actor who played the Master dropped out of sight after this was made, and very sad that Torgo killed himself(It was because of family troubles). With better camera shots, a better actress to play Margaret, destruction of the pathetic policeman scens with the teenagers,if the hands of fate actually did something perhaps, and better sound quality especially for Debbie, I would love this film much more. I find it disturbing that Manos was left unfinished(Director couldnt get funding). I imagine Torgo would have made a return to save Margaret and the rest.  I give it a 6 out of 10 for some mistakes, but whos perfect?",

But folks, you need to go back to 1966 where before Street Fighter, before Gigli, before Flintstones Rock Vegas and before Catwoman, Manos The Hands Of Fate was released onto our screens.I just simply don't know how this happened. Was it laziness? Was it carelessness? Or was it a dangerous amount of deadbeat? Possibly the latter. No seriously, You thought Gigli was the worst movie ever? THINK AGAIN! Manos the Hands Of Fate is the most severe antidote to quality film making on the planet. Words simply do not describe it's pure vileness enough It is truly worthy of the title, the worst movie ever made.Now, we know how bad the above mentioned movies are, plus there's bound to be tons more that I haven't watched, so what makes me so sure that this is THE ONE to claim the crown? Simple. Because it masters the art of badness in each and every single conceivable department in a way that never before has been done by any other movie. Ever.So where to start the bashing. Well pretty much everywhere really. Writing, directing, acting, cinematography, sound, lighting, sets, costumes, music, plot, character -- it's all shoddy, inept and embarrassing. With most bad movies, you can tell at the very least SEMI-professionals were making it.But Jesus no not Manos. In fact Manos origins are so unbelievable you would probably think it didn't exist at all. Hal Warren (who wrote, directed, and stars in this mess) was a Texas fertiliser salesman who made a bet with a friend that he could make a successful low-budget horror film. Warren rounded up a group of actors (most with no training whatsoever), an ancient camera (that could only capture 32 seconds of footage at a time and couldn't record sound), and pounded out a script filled with long periods where nothing at all happens (witnessed early on through the 10 or so minute long segment of the family driving through the country).It is also to date, the only episode of Mystery Science Theatre 3000 that left the bots lost for words. You know the kind of guys who boo at the end of a crap movie right? These guys make a LIVING out of doing so, yet they were virtually UNABLE to even make even a quip at this bobbins, so stunned they were by it's appalling vileness! I should also point out that no one who appeared in this film ever worked in film again\u0097and that John Reynolds committed suicide in 1966 as well. So there goes my jokes about people deserving hanging for making bad movies. Sheesh! In fact Manos only achievement whatsoever is that it completely transformed the hotly contested battle to become worst movie ever, into an unassailable one horse race. Never has so much been taken away from so many and given to so few in the quest to achieve sheer celluloid badness.Manos The Hands Of Fate. Officially the worst movie of all time. Don't watch this film.",

And yet, it's still watchable, at least if you're a fan of MST3K.  Manos is goofily bad in an Ed Wood kind of way -- the kind of bad that you somehow can't help but watch.I have, and have watched, Manos in its uncut and unMSTed format, and despite this nervous tic I've developed in the aftermath, it's actually not as horrible as one might be led to believe.  The film's shortcomings are obvious: it was shot on a hand-cranked camera, so not only did *all* sound have to be added in post-production, but no shot could be longer than some 30 seconds.  The plot is non-existent, and in almost all cases, the acting is sufficiently wooden to construct a treehouse out of.But like an Ed Wood movie, the film has something that keeps you watching it.  Here, it's John Reynolds, who I can't help but think could have been a good actor if given a chance.  He certainly seemed to enjoy acting, and I have to wonder what his delivery was like (no way of knowing, since all male voices were dubbed in later by Hal Warren).  Torgo is creepy, weird, and disturbing, but still compelling in a strange way.Apparently, Torgo was supposed to be a satyr; it was hard to tell whether he had hooves in the MST3K episode of Manos.  I have seen the movie unMSTed and can reliably report that Torgo indeed had hooves -- assuming hooves are shaped like ratty brown loafers.  :)No, I'm not going to say that Manos isn't a bad movie.  But with small budget contenders like 'Wild World of Batwoman,' 'Chance: Trail of the Apache' and 'Apache Blood' out there (not to mention big-budget flicks like 'Ishtar,' 'North' and 'Battlefield Earth'), it's not as bad as all that. It certainly could have been worse, but admittedly not by much.ikaros says this is a must-have if you're a z-movie fan.",

I thank MST3K for allowing me to see some of the worst movies ever without having my soul shrink into a cold dark husk.That being said, \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" really got to me, even with the colorful commentary of MST3K. There is nothing redeeming about this movie: the camera shots are bad, the sound is worse, and the acting makes my head swim. Worst of all, however, is the content of the movie itself. The audience is treated to shots of Torgo the goat man leering through the window at the undressing heroine, wrestling women (which I guess the director thought would titillate the audience instead of making them feel uncomfortable) and, worst of all, a short clip of the young daughter of the wayward travelers being made a bride of the Master.

Following the \"out of sight, out of mind\" formula used by govenments, corporations, and disturbed people around the globe, the two-person Commission hopes that if the word \"manos\" is only spoken in Spanish conversations, the humiliation will slowly evaporate away. Thanks to IMDB and \"MST3K\", that won't happen. As I have said to others, \"Manos\" is just your average piece of bad regional film-making. Because it was made so cheaply, I have the strong impression that the movie was a tax shelter, though it could be that Warren was actually a genius commenting on the banality of evil.

It's a tough enough task for a major Hollywood facility to do properly. Godzilla, anyone? -What provolked someone to make this story, or lack thereof, into a movie? A dare?  A bar-bet?  Shades of \"The Producers\" if you ask me. -Is the cast's acting style a salute to German expressionism of the 20's? Or was everyone simply fatigued from their day-jobs and lacked the energy to move at normal human speeds? -What's the deal with Torgo?  Knock-knees is an affliction that is neither frightening nor sympathy inducing.  If it's such a chore for him to move, as evidenced by the incredibly long sequences of him loading and un-loading luggage, shouldn't he sit down and rest those weary limbs from time to time? -Isn't that tiny two room shack a little small to be housing all that evilness?

I believe that to save money, Hal Warren employed this technique, badly. It would explain the run-on takes and poor timing evident in this movie.

The person whose name was drawn would have their film script made into a movie, and that name was Harold Warren.  Alas, the greatness of this movie has been overshadowed by the Torgo curse.  It is when one commits suicide after completing a movie of such acclaim.  For shame El Paso!",

Although much of that would be from it's sheer incompetence. -1 for not bad, but absolutely horrid acting from much of the cast, most particularly the women. I thought torgo was decent actually, but that was probably because he was coked out for most of production. -1 for horrible directing. Hal p. Warren being hisfirst directed film and having only the funds to have very little freedom in acting or plot did better than most people would have done under the circumstances, but still not a good job. -1 for bad music in places. The only piece of music I did like was the fast paced piano solo that appears throughout the film, but it appears in unnecessary places at times. -1 for bad editing. The editor(s) might not have had the premiere footage to work with, but I think a very smart chimpanzee could have done better. -1 for bad dialog writing. First off, a few of the characters repeat some phrases back to back without even a change in mood or tone. The dialog writing was bad, but then again, Hal Warren didn't have the money for hiring a writer.To sum it up, I think this could be an averagely entertaining movie with the proper qualities fixed. Everything negative that I noticed wrong with the movie can be fixed with improved writing, a more competent cast and crew, and more money. Of course major adjustments would have to be made to the plot, but it could be workable. (I hear Tarantino likes this movie: remake maybe?)",

This movie is SO bad, that its unexplainable in words, but I'll give my best.First of all, the camera-work is the first bad sign you notice watching this movie, which doesn't matter that much if the movie were good. The other thing that really bothers me is that The actors are so bad that I think a bum in a garbage bin outside would do a better job acting. Also, the movie is supposed to be a horror movie but its a different kind of horror! You don't get scared by any monster but the movie itself.

However, for those of you who don't know and/or understand the basic outlines of the film, or the story of its creation, I write this review.First of all, Manos the hands of fate was written by a fertilizer salesman from Texas, who was bet that he could not make a classic horror film. That fertilizer salesman is Hal P. Warren, a.k.a. Michael, the star of the film. Of course, once one realizes that Hal cast himself as the star, the film begins to make SOME sense.The premise is that a family of three (Four if you count their pet dog) gets lost on their way to a resort in the middle of nowhere. However, before the characters are even introduced, we are first held victim to a 14-minute car drive seen, wherein the audience views first a field, then another field, then the steering wheel......... anyways, you get the point. After the fourteen minute car scene, we are introduced to Torgo, a caretaker with humongous knees. This is where the dialogue becomes extremely choppy. It basically goes a little something like this: Torgo: \"I am Torgo. I manage the place while the master is away\". Michael: \"Hello Torgo. Would you mind if we stayed here until the weather improves?\" Torgo: \"I don't know if the master would approve\". Michael's wife: \"I don't like the looks of this place dear...\" Michael: \"There's nowhere else around for miles. We'll have to stay here. Well, Torgo? Whaddaya say?\" Torgo: \"I d'd'don't know if the m'm'master would approve\"The movie improves very little from that point. We are first introduced to a portrait of the master, which Mike and his family stare at for what seems like hours, followed by the master's dog and wives, and of course finally the master himself. The master wears a black poncho with two giant bloody hand prints pressed under the armpits down, so that when the master spreads his arms, we see what looks like a pair of hands, which doesn't help AT ALL to explain what the hell Manos is. By the way, you never do actually find out what Manos is, although the Master and his wives do talk a helluva lot about it, i.e. \"Manos, I put my trust in you. We worship you with all we have\"... I couldn't help but wonder, \"What the hell is a manos?\"Of course there is a reason why this movie is considered the worst movie ever made. It is also considered by some to be worthy of a ten rating. I feel that this is just an abuse of a privilege, given to them by the IMDb crew. Seriously people, its not hard to realize that this truly is the worst movie ever made. No film this atrocious deserves a ten. In summary, I feel that even a 1 is too gracious for this steaming pile.",

Whoever saw these scenes in the editing room must not have cared what they looked like, and numerous shots have a \"let's get this damn thing done\" look. Probably due to the fact this thing took two and a half months to shot on an actually not that small budget, considering the time. (Look what Mark Borchardt managed with $3,000 today with COVEN.) But, all told, people who call this \"the worst movie ever made\" are just going with the flow. The worst movie, logically, is FACES OF DEATH, because it is actually evil in its intentions: conditioning people to react to the thrill of seeing others die or suffer without caring. Hal Warren does include a rather disgusting shot towards the end where pedophilia is implied, but he doesn't seem to be trying to derive a thrill from it. Has probably the best ending of any feature ever shown on MST3K, and actually might work in screenplay form.",

I won't repeat all the previous comments about the movie: every reasonable or even average-minded person will agree on the absolute nullity of this full nadir in the history of cinema: so, it is very useful to set your scale to zero (that is, 1 by definition at IMDb). As a corollary, which may be construed as its second function, \"Manos...\" is thus the perfect universal ground zero on which every other movie suddenly takes a contour and perspective, including famous \"worst ever-s\" that abound in opinions that cluster around titles such as the inevitable \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\", which, thanks to Manos, gives a novel elegance to the Art of Ed Wood. Such an important role for Manos cannot be overestimated: force every IMDb under 18 to watch Manos (there are ways to check if they did their homework!!! \ud83d\ude02) and I'm sure we won't read reviews with that dreaded condemnation: this is the worst movie EVER! Anymore because everybody knows it's Manos.In summary, we must thank Harold P. Warren for rallying all the critics around his Bizarro world masterpiece, where antiactors play antiroles with an antiscript and move along through a hostile environment of floating antimatter, risking dramatic annihilation at every antimoment until the very end, where they finally dissolve in a cosmic explosion when all that antimatter hits true matter, and the viewer reads the word DNE EHT on the last frame of Manos.What a great experience it was!",

The place houses an 'evil cult' worshipping some long-faced deity called Manos. Mayhem ensues.That's all I'm gonna say about the plot. Now on to the acting--wait, what acting? Well, one thing you should know (in the event that you haven't seen this yet--either in MST3K or ordinary form) is that the film was made on a bet between its director (and main star), who was a fertilizer salesman, and a bad movie director by the name of Silliphant (yeah, I agree, his name sounds like an STD) who said the cow patty king couldn't make a film. Despite the fact that the film reeks like rotting durians, the fertilizer guy won the bet.For those of you who haven't seen it, I'll say this as well: -If you like bad B-movies, watch it.-If you can't stand B-movies, watch the MST3K version.-If you can't stand MST3K, don't watch it period.Thank you.",

But when we get to the part about a satyr with a nerve disorder and the film showing you a portrait three times over just to make sure you figure it out, when you're watching IL' Torgo go scampering off on fire and not making a sound, you realize: The director was lacking basic brain function. A camera with no sound I can handle. That's basically what happens with animated movies, after all. But a movie where they have three people total on the voice-acting cast? A movie with no music at all? A movie with novice actors AND no post-production to remove their blunders? SUCKO, man. There's this one bit of the movie that I love: the bit when the family first enters the house where the wife is looking around, focuses her attention on the camera, rolls her eyes as she realizes she's not supposed to, then hurriedly looks away. Hehehe. This movie had on the floor for weeks. It's quite possibly the worst thing to come out of the movie industry.

Did this fertilizer salesman actually think he could entertain somebody by: 1. assembling a cast of slack-jawed yokels, 2. borrowing a road camera from the DMV to film the movie, 3. throwing together a cheap wardrobe that consisted of garments from local rummage and garage sales, and 4. using the same person to dub all of the voices.Enough about production values, lets now talk about the \"plot.\"  The beginning road scene took about 20 minutes of endless driving, in which the car appeared to be driving in all different directions.  This seemed to be a theme of the movie, pointless, endless scenes where nothing happens.  There was a severe shortage of dialogue in this movie, talk about uncomfortable silences.  The only time the silences were broken was when Torgo grunted and groaned, like he was on the toilet. No one is going to believe that this family wants to stay with a half-man, half-goat, stuttering mutant. However, the father kept reassuring his family that everything was all right, even when they found half-naked women chained in the basement.  There was a string of scenes which featured a couple making out, that were completely unnecessary.  What is the point of this?  This couple was making out during the whole span of the movie in the same place. \nBasically this movie was the most sloppy piece of cinema ever thrown together.  We have an idea.  Set up your tri-pod, point it at the toilet, flush it, and put it on a continuous two-hour loop, and it would make for better film.  Somehow, our lives are a little bit worse after viewing this bag over the head.  We feel tainted by the fate that Manos has set upon us. If you ever come across a copy of Manos at a dingy, run-down video store, dusty and covered with cob-webs, please do your public service, and smash it, then burn it, then bury the ashes in a cool, dry place where not even \"the master\" can find them.",

Ugh. The plot about the devil and his wives isn't worth explaining, and the... er... \"famous\" burning hand scene is the stupidest thing ever put on film. Film that I hope was burned and thrown into a bottomless pit. The sound is annoying and repetitious at best, and literally sounds like a 2 year old walking on a piano, back and forth, back and forth.

Except for Torgo's knees, nothing much in this caused me any laughter. For me, the most interesting aspect of 'Manos' was checking out the film \"careers\" of the players here on imdb. Three of them, John Reynolds (Torgo), Diane Mahree (Margaret) and Joyce Molleur, committed suicide the same year as the movies release! That has to be some sort of morbid record. Only two of the players had any previous experience in film, Sherry Proctor had been a script girl on the 1956 movie Atilla and Mary-Robin Redd had appeared in a television program and one movie prior to this and actually fashioned a decent if not prolific little career for herself. Pat Sullivan (and I am still not sure who she was in 'Manos')  did a second film some 37 years later entitled \"Security\" where oddly enough the top-billed actor plays a character named Pat Sullivan. To my strange little mind this stuff was much more entertaining than the actual movie. \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" is generally acknowledged as the worst film of my generation and I still watch it whenever I get the chance because it still makes me laugh. I wish I had seen 'Manos' on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I may have enjoyed a bit if I had. Rating: 0 out of 5",

Sure the story is really the most basic horror plot possible, but it's unorthodox style prohibits mundanity. Of course the acting is bad, but it is unintentional and not overconfident overacting, it is enjoyable not just some Hallmark style acting. The music is bad, well, it's actually good, really really good(I listen to the album almost weekly). Everything is incredibly watchable about it, kinda like Rocky III (1982).

I'm almost certain that this wasn't the niche market that Hal Warren was aiming for, but thanks to this truly inept little picture's exposure as Experiment 424 of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", it'll always gain infamy as, arguably, the Worst Movie Ever Made. Granted, it didn't try to be, and nobody on the cast or crew ever suspected that it would be...but when your director deals in fertilizer for a living, there are certain expectations about the final cut that it's best to have beforehand.The story is simple enough - family gets lost on vacation and stumbles upon the secret lair of a satanic cult leader and his army of undead wives. The premise has all the potential in the world, and Hal Warren had the amazing ability to take all that potential and completely eliminate it. Even from the first two minutes of the movie, it's glaringly obvious that Warren had no idea what the hell he was doing. Filmed on a 16mm with no sound-recording abilities, the movie begins with some poorly-dubbed dialog, a cop who's easily swayed out of administering a ticket, and the most agonizing five minutes of driving footage that anyone would ever have the misfortune to lay eyes on. When this family finally pulls into the Lodge of Sins (as it was identified in the movie's working title, which is probably better than a title that literally translates into \"Hands: the Hands of Fate\"), they encounter the knobby-thighed caretaker Torgo, who is easily the most memorable and most pitiful character from this film. Ranting about how \"the Master does not approve\" and swaying like Joe Cocker with Parkinson's, Torgo brings in the luggage while dull Mike and idiotic Maggie stare blankly at a painting of the Master for about five days. Eventually, the pet dog runs outside and gets dead, the \"damn car won't start\", and little Debbie runs off and befriends a doe-eyed and lovable hell-beast. And I in the audience contemplate the many ways to murder oneself.Anyway, the Master (who resembles the love child of Bill Buckner and Freddy Mercury) brings his undead wives to life, and they immediately start kibitzing about whether or not to murder this family full of poor schmucks who have wandered onto their turf. While the talks break down into a shameless cat fight (probably the only reason the movie was even made in the first place), the Master drags Torgo into things by insisting that he (Torgo) has \"failed\", and now he \"must die\" (though it's never made clear how he failed, or why he must die). Mike and the family try to make a break for it while Torgo gets a lethal facial massage and the Master bludgeons his first wife to death with stage blood, but the end result of all this is probably something that even dead people can see coming a mile away. Somehow, a teenage couple making out on the side of the road for days on end factors into all of this, but I have neither the time nor the incentive to analyze their roles further.I guess, if you think about it, Hal Warren was right in his assumption that anyone can make a movie. However, he was dead wrong in his assumption that anyone can make a good movie. It's also worth noting that John Reynolds, the man who played Torgo, blew his brains out a few months before the movie's premiere. Turns out, he had the right idea.",

            "content": "I'm sorry, but I really have to weigh in on this puppy.I think everyone is making way too much of 'Manos'. Sure, it's fun to queue up and pound away at this pathetic punching bag of a movie, but that's hardly a worthy challenge, is it. One might as well stuff a runty, two-day old kitten into a pair of wrestling Speedos then drop Andre the Giant onto it like a bomb. Wow. What a contest.Part of the problem (well, my problem) with the reviews, springs from the tacit notion that this film is legitimate. That is to say, legitimate to the extent that there is a general assumption that because it actually made it into the theaters, it belonged there at all. With that legitimacy lent, it then became fair game and, hence, worthy of any level of consideration. But knowing that the film's creator attempted to distance himself from his own creation, leads me to believe that, ultimately, 'Manos' was never intended to be released into the world of Man. (Well, at least not into the world of THIS man.) Consider: Should the impromptu Super 8's of your infant nephew Stevie explosively pooping into his Pampers hit the local Cineplex? Of course not. So your Sony camera caught all the hot action when that errant barbecue spark got to your new Ferrari Modena which then sent your flame-engulfed great grandmother on her merry way through the garage door. You really want moviegoers to sit through that sort of thing? Come on.And something else. There is no great profundity or meaning in the fact that some cast members took their own lives, and perhaps due to the incredible shame they felt in participating in such a crumby venture. No one kills themselves over appearing in bad movies (although some should). It is more likely that anyone disturbed enough to volunteer for 'Manos' is disturbed enough to \"off\" themselves without 'Manos' as a catalyst. 'Manos' was symptomatic; it wasn't the cause. Those four actors? I feel for them, but their days were numbered long before 'Manos' ever steamily plopped into the theaters. Okay. It's possible that 'Manos' accelerated them toward their common doom like an F-16CJ in full afterburner. Still, it was gonna happen. Further evidence as to the psychological state of the cast members? (Notice that I avoid calling them actors.) The performances throughout. Case closed. I won't waste IMDb server space on this one. Although, going by Torgo's performance, one could be forgiven for assuming that his suicide preceded the making of 'Manos'. That would nicely explain much of what I saw (and smelled).With that said on the suicides, it's quite possible that the four in question faked their own deaths in order to escape the ignominy associated with their hideous doings. Sort of an augmented version of the witness protection program, although, in this case the witnesses are also the perpetrators. Doesn't seem fair, does it.Final Comment: I was 10 years old and in Brooklyn when 'Manos' was released. So it's highly unlikely that I had anything to do with it. I just wanted that out there for the record. Thank you.",

I'm one of the biggest MST3K fans I know, but even Joel and the Bots have been unable to convince me to leave the remote alone during this one.  To all those who say this is the worst movie ever made, I happily add my voice.  I think the reason that Comedy Central made the shocking career move to ditch MST3K must have been because the president of that network caught \"Manos\" once, judged MST3K from that experience, and may even have assumed that Best Brains was wasting his money putting together fake films at which they could poke fun.  If we assume that he didn't have access to the IMDB to check up on things, I can definitely see him thinking that nothing -- nothing -- could possibly be this bad. Sadly, that is not true.  \"Manos\" lacks everything that is redeeming in any film experience.  You name an aspect of filmmaking, and this movie shows perfectly how to do it wrong.  But not wrong in a funny way.  Just badly. Very badly.  Unspeakably badly.  I've seen \"Manos\" all the way through only by catching different parts during different airings of the MST3K episode. So I probably am a bit better off than most people posting here, because I can imagine at least halfway decent editing between the many fragments of absolute, unadulterated, complete, utter garbage that have burned their way into all the minds that have been forever scarred by this so-called movie. My first name is \"Manus\" and my last name is \"Hand\" (honest) and fellow MSTies blame my 1964 birth announcement in a L.A. newspaper for somehow giving Hal Warren the idea for this piece of truly unspeakable tripe.  I can only pray that it isn't true, or I will never forgive my father for not naming me \"David\" or something.  If there's any movie in the IMDB database that is a perfect 1, it is this one.  I urge everyone to drag its rating as low as it can possibly go, because this, truly, is the epitome of bad.  To those fortunate enough to have yet been spared the experience of seeing this pile of crap, I know how tempting it must be to read these juicily ugly reviews and to want to know for yourself if \"Manos\" can truly be as bad as everyone says.  Take my advice, though, and save yourself from a fate that I swear you do not -- cannot -- understand.  Do yourself the biggest favor of your life:  do NOT see \"Manos.\"  And tell the world that \"Manus\" saved you from it.  Help rehabilitate my reputation.  It's not my fault!",

They drive. And they drive. Then they drive some more. And when they're through, they drive. The highlights of this part is the thrilling \"Getting pulled over for a busted tailight scene\", and a scene of a couple out to break the Guinness Book of World Records record for longest time kissing in a car, while drinking what appears to be Coppertone suntan lotion.Finally, they come to the \"Lodge\". And now we meet the experience that is, Torgo. Torgo cannot be fully explained. He must be witnessed. But, let's try. He moves about as if he's walking on Jello. He talks in this kind of up-and-down sing song that sounds like someone is giving him a very slow wedgie, kinda like Foster Brooks, and every time anyone asks him a question, he looks like his thinking process has been permanently removed. But he does have delightful theme music, as long as you like four notes being played over and over until blood comes out of your ears.I thought the best actors were the moths that circled around the lights on every night exterior shot. The master's wives looked hideous. The scene where they're bickering while he's scowling at them is as good a testimony against poligamy as you'll find.Did anyone count how many times Maggie's (the female victim) kerchief appeared and disappeared? It was really starting to annoy me. How did you like Torgo's \"execution\"? The biddies slapped and massaged him to death, but at least he was able to walk away. He wanders out of the movie, probably looking for someone to give him a hand! (sorry).The ending was abomidable. Bad enough we've been subjected to nearly two hours of utter disregard to our psyche, but to offer as climax the father as Torgo-lite, the mother and child (app. six years old!) as new additions to the harem is sick!

Things, unfortunately, go steadily downhill from there.That's too bad, because you really have to root for Hal Warren to be a success and make a film that captures the hearts of all Americans.  The plucky Warren, who is credited as director and writer of \"Manos\" (it would, unfortunately for theatre goers everywhere, be his only film), also put his considerable talents into a job as a Texas fertilizer salesman. Ironically, the movie and the product by which Mr. Warren made his living have much in common, perhaps unintentionally or perhaps not.If it's true that everyone has fifteen minutes of fame, Mr. Warren perhaps did not put his time in the spotlight to its most productive use.  Mere words are simply inadequate to describe the enormity of this film's (and \"film\" should be very loosely interpreted here)wretchedness.  Therefore, I shall save myself the effort.The most memorable character is a chap named Torgo.  Torgo is a pillar of the community who pursues the honorable profession of goatman.  The world was perhaps robbed of an award-winning actor when John Reynolds, who played Torgo, committed suicide the same year \"Manos\" was made (perhaps as atonement for his appearance in this assault on humanity).  Sadly, we will never know what other contributions Mr. Reynolds may have gone on to make to the noble world of cinematic drivel, especially since \"Manos\" was the only movie in which he appeared.I should point out that I have never seen this film other than on MST3K.

Wether these are side-effects of the movie or not who cares this movie was bad. Im sure some of the people who read the other comments are thinking \" this movie cant be that bad, can it?\" The answer is YES! I want you to think of all the things that made Shawshank Redemption ( or what have you ) magnificent and take all that and completely flush it down the jon. Now if my useless rambling isnt enough to convince you then check out some of these facts.1. The director and overall creator ( Hal Warren ) was a fertilizer salesman before this movie. 2. Hal made this movie on a bet that he could make a decent horror film ( wonder who won that one???) 3.Manos is spanish for hands, therefore the true title is \"Hands, The Hands of Fate. 4. The camera Hal used could not record sound and could only record 30 seconds of film before the film was replacedNow if this isnt enough, then hey watch the movie. Trust me it is even difficult and agaonizing to watch with the help of the bots and Joel. I suppose some of the people out there think i am being too critical, and maybe i am, but i dont care. I will grant those people something and that is they are right that some newer and more expensive movies have been made and come close to this one. The only good thing about this movie is that it can substitute as a sleeping bill. Overall a movie with solid bad directing, acting, writing, and all the other stuff.  2/10\n\" There's no way out of here, it'll be dark soon, there's no way out of here\"Torgo, Manos the hands of fate",

The stink of it still fills my nostrils. That there are 15 films voted worse on the 100 worse films list just shows that people have not seen 'Manos'.

I've seen more genuine emotion and expression at a church seniors BINGO game.The plot is flimsy, pedestrian and without any depth. It does not challenge or even interest me in any way whatsoever. This is one of the few non-linear films I've seen that was unintentionally so. You could mix the scenes up and would get the same end product which still stank. Probably the worst film editing I've seen. No real thought or skill is apparent in the process.This film's cinematography is abhorrent. No planning went into the shots, the lighting was inept; some indoor scenes lit very dark and then a few moments later the room is blazing with over exposure.The special effects were neither special nor effective! The director had no clue what he was doing. Actors staring blankly at each other for 2 minutes takes real genius to produce :) There are some very awful movies that have been made yet usually one can find some redeeming quality in the film. 'Manos' has no such quality! The seminal moment of action in the film when the Master's zombie beauties fight amongst themselves was devoid of any sincerity or emotional impact. They might as well have been arguing over which hair spray worked best! This movie felt like an eternity and were it not for the humor interjected by MST3K I would have turned it off in the first few minutes. I urge you to not watch this film.

It's a fairly short film with fun music, so it's a lot easier to sit through than reports of it had led me to believe.  (Some people claim that \"MANOS\" knocks Plan 9 From Outer Space out of the running for Worst Film of All Time, because Plan 9 is perversely enjoyable, while \"MANOS\" is pure pain.  This is as false as the claim that Plan 9 is the worst movie ever made.)  The funny thing is, most people who comment on \"MANOS\" have never seen the proper version of it.

Movies such as \"feardotcom\" don't have ten minutes of scenery, women wrestling each other in nightgowns, and a villain that couldn't scare a rabbit. What makes it funny is that you can tell that Hal was actually trying to make a serious attempt at a horror film. He didn't intend for it to be humor, but that's the way it turned out.\nWhen speaking solely of horror films, I give this film the lowest score possible (It came out to a -0.3 on my 10 scale)Place this film on the scale of comedy films, and I give it a solid 5 out of 10. However, I will issue a disclaimer pointing out the fact that not all audiences may find this movie particularly humorous. Fans of bad movies probably will. Since judging of movies is generally by genre (how well does the movie do what it's supposed to?), I would say that this is the worst movie ever made. However, depending on who you are, this may not be the worst movie to watch. In any case, it is a must see for bad movie fans.

I looked into why this piece of crap was even made, and I found out a lot of information that kind of made me take a second look. The film was made because Harold Warren made a bet with a friend of his that he could make a movie. The guy was a fertilizer salesman. Made and sold it apparently. He didn't really know anything about making movies. Well, he had this junky camera that had to be wound up to film. It only filmed 30 seconds of film at a time and it did not record sound. He and another guy and some woman did all the voices for the film after filming. I didn't even realize that until I read it, so I got to give props to the guy for being inventive enough and to be able to have the patients to do all that work that had to be done to make an actual story. Not a good one, but still a story. He tried to make a sequel, but for some reason was turned away about it. The sequel was written as a book, but I unfortunately do not know the title of it. For some strange reason I would like to read it just to see what else Harold had in mind for a sequel. Its like a train wreck, I shouldn't be looking but I can't look away.

            "content": "This film is truly a murky mess, inept in every possible manner. The film has a very stereotypical plot common in pratically every other horror movie (including The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which the plot is rather similar to). A young couple and their daughter get lost out in seedy country of El Paso Texas. So they stop at the nearest house to ask for directions. As you can guess, this is a big freaking mistake! They are met by Torgo, the wobbly, bizarre voiced handy-man, who tells them not to stay, because, as he says \"The master would not approve\". They beg him, and finally he caves, though he warns \"The master will be very disturbed.\" Soon the \"master\", a Satan-like character bearing a resemblance to Frank Zappa, wakes up and all sorts of horrible things start to happen to family. The ending could be one of the most loathesome, downbeat endings ever.There are many bad movies. But none of them have the all around ineptness of this (though Space Mutiny comes pretty close). Many films are really bad and cheap, but at least they often have some interesting camera angles and are often fun to watch. Manos has none of that. It's just 70 minutes of murky boredom. If it had beautiful photography, fine acting and the filmmakers tried to make the best of their budget (like many good independent films), it could have been a Night of the Living Dead-like classic. The photography is the definition of murkyness, it looks like an extremely faded Super 8 film and there is not one interesting, imaginative shot in the whole film, and combined with the content it end up looking exactly like a Satanist's home movies. And the sound quality is just as bad, perhaps even a bit worse. The camera the filmmakers used could not record sound (and they were obviously too stupid or too cheap to carry a sound recorder of some kind with them), so the whole film is dubbed, really, really badly. All the voices are done by two people, and they all sound exactly alike, and are so overracted it's downright asinine (especially poor Torgo). The actor's may have been good, but we don't know that. And I found it very sad (and at same time rather darky hilarious), that the man who played Torgo commited suicide shortly after this was released, just proving how much of a downer being in a mind numbingly bad movie can be. This whole mess of a film just proves that fertilizer salesmen aren't good filmmakers! Even watching your relatives home movies is far less boring than this. However, the film was shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000, and that episode is truly a hoot, a true MST3K classic.",

For this very reason, you must see it.Yes, you will laugh, but this is not \"The Room.\" Wiseau's film garners most of its insanity from how badly it wants to use cliche lines, sequences, stories, etc. But doesn't have a clue what to do with any of them (among other things like horrible acting and strangely bad green screen and sets). You see what Wiseau was going for in any one scene, how badly he missed, and how inevitable that miss always was.Manos, however, is something else. It's nonsense that believes in itself! It lies somewhere between insanity and boredom. There It's a plot based film without any plot. There are characters with no traits at all. There are story elements that seem to appear and disappear with wind. Is it a thriller? A drama? Fantasy? It's all three but at different times for the wrong reasons. It is the worst B-movie script ever written yet it has the pacing of a Terrance Malick movie. The pacing is so slow that, when it's over, you can barely tell that the story has even taken place anc yet it has, you just didn't know it. Or, if you did, you don't know what you saw. The cinematography is actively disgusting - I don't mean gross! It is deranged. Shots and cuts either happen or they don't and there can be no explaining any of them. The compositions are so horrible, it belies belief.The acting is likely the most inexplicable I've ever seen. Far from the cringy, melodramatic performances of bad actors we are accustomed to in the B-movie, here, it seems the actors simply don't know what they're performing at all though, clearly they must. There is so little emotion or affect in the on-screen actors' movements or from the voices of the handful of people that dub every character (they don't exactly do character voices either) is genuinely shocking. How could someone, who works as an insurance salesman, raise $19,000 (about.$160,000 as of 2022) and care so little about anything going on?! It staggers the mind.I'm not going to talk much about the technical d problems because, frankly, though they are bad, some of them are excusable for a no budget movie made by a salesman in El Paso.However, I would be remiss if I did not leave you by discussing the opening. Our main couple is driving down a road in Texas and is lost. And they're lost. And they're lost. And they're lost. For over 9 minutes, we just see them drive aimlessly in the Southwest while adlibbing lines about how lost they are. There was clearly supposed to be titles here but there's not. He just forgot. He could have cut this scene out or down significantly. He put work in to make it run that long. Why?!Why?! Why?! Why to it all!!!",

            "content": "First off, let me stress that I watched the MST3K version of this, so that may have helped to cushion the blow. I also prepped myself for this movie by reading a ton of reviews about it. Therefore, I was expecting this to be an insanely mind numbing experience that I would never be able to make it all the way through. After having seen it, I have to admit that it wasn't the monstrosity that I built it up to be. Make no mistake, this is NOT a good movie, but I wasn't as astounded by the poor production of this movie as others. To me, it came across as a high school production of a play written by one of the students. Knowing in advance that the vast majority of people involved in this movie knew next to nothing about making films helped me be a little more forgiving of the vast array of technical flaws. The basic story that Hal Warren devised could have worked in the right hands (no pun intended). What he didn't understand was how to take that idea and turn it into a full length feature film. Hence we get pointless scenes of endless driving, teenagers making out, people staring at paintings, girls wrestling, etc.I'd love to see a remake of this movie with the following changes: First, I'd spend more time in the beginning with the family before they leave for this trip, to help us identify with the characters. Maybe the relationship between husband and wife isn't going so well, and they hope that over vacation they can try to bury the hatchet. Then, I'd lose those teenagers and change the cops to detectives investigating the disappearance of six couples over a period of years in one small town. These six couples would represent the Master's six wives and his male slaves. I'd change the circumstances of how the family winds up in this house. Big change: Torgo. I'd make him appear completely normal, albeit quirky (think Norman Bates). This serves two purposes - first, it would be easier to believe that the family would stay there in the first place. Second, it would help throw off suspicion of any wrong-doing. As for the Master, I would make him Manos, instead of having Manos be the deity that the Master worships. He would be a Devil-like creature - the epitome of all evil. He would have very definite powers such as the power to possess and the power to shapeshift. I'd probably have the Torgo character and Margaret find a mutual attraction, to add motivation for Torgo to defy the master and to add conflict between Mike & Margaret. This is just an example of the many things that could possibly make this movie an enjoyable experience.In the end, I have to give Hal Warren a little credit. I'd be willing to bet that there are far worse things that were put onto film by well known directors on their first try - I don't mean their first feature film, I mean the very first time they ever rolled film to try to tell a story. Hey, almost 7,000 people have rated it on the IMDb, and I'm sure that thousands of others have seen it. For a horror movie that was made 40 years ago on a shoestring budget by someone who'd never been involved with the movie industry, I'd say that's pretty cool. Worst movie ever? No, and here's why: Hal Warren & the entire cast and crew just didn't have the know-how to make a better movie. I'd reserve the honor of Worst Movie for something like \"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\", where EVERYONE involved should have known better.",

I couldn't stop laughing (not what the filmmaker was looking for, I assume). My wife and I just HAD to see it after the article in Entertainment Weekly. Now having seen it, I can safely say it's probably the worst movie I've seen in its entirety, but I loved every frame! There may be worse movies, but I've walked out or stopped the tape in the middle.So, Manos: The Hands of Fate is not the worst movie I've ever seen (this honor is held by The Thin Red Line, but I digress), and it's not without it's artistic flairs (I hesitate to call them 'merits'). Dig the images of Hands throughout the movie. Try to count them all. I bet you'll miss one or two. The camera used for the filming did not record sound, so the dialog and sounds were dubbed in later during editing, and knowing this, the film makers did their best to not often show people's mouths while they were speaking. So A for effort for working around the limitations of your equipment (F for effort for not, like, buying another camera? or a sound recorder and slate... but I digress).Let's talk about the acting. Gosh. About 2 minutes in, you can see why Mystery Science Theatre panned this movie. But the performance of John Reynolds as Torgo is fascinating to watch. (Not necessarily good fascinating, like, say, Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs, but you know, funny fascinating). It's entertaining and somewhat poignant, as we know he committed suicide shortly after filming. The article lead me to believe he was tripping on acid while filming, and this is borne out in the on-screen footage. One finds the pondering of this man's plight more interesting than the movie itself.Torgo's deformed legs are never really explained, though the EW article said he was a half goat satyr. In my opinion, this is not borne out by the on-screen footage. Plot-wise, (shudder) it's stock, with many clich\u00e9s and some narrative blunders that don't make sense and absurdly repetitive dialog. And repetitive dialog. Did I mention the repetitive dialog? It's a drinking game in the making. There's also a protracted (but not very dangerous looking) cat-fight scene between six women clad in cheap curtains, and The Master's robes are actually very cool, except when he hikes them up to walk around and you can see his skinny, white little legs. Not as intimidating as the portrait that we get to study in detail for a good five or six minutes total. Compelling footage, that.So, should you see this movie? YES! YES I SAY. Get some buddies and make a Rocky Horror-esquire night of it. You must watch it, and LOVE EVERY MOMENT! This is the Law of Manos!",

            "content": "My boyfriend and I were planning on watching this together, however after a long think to myself I couldn't resist watching this mess of a movie alone. You might be reassured to hear that I completely plan on watching this film again, not because I'm a huge fan of horror and the thrill of being scared, but because it's not everyday I find a film that actually makes me genuinely laugh.The first thing I noticed about this film is how the audio doesn't fit with the character's mouths. The screeches and whines of the characters accompanied with delayed reactions and simply over exaggerated faces make up for how bad the voice actors were at voice acting. Not that the actors on screen were much better, but right from the start of the film i was laughing. Several lines are also repeated many times, which could be blamed on bad scriptwriting, but I choose to believe were to present the duration of this family's roadtrip, and that despite how long and boring it is, it is so much better than what will happen to them eventually.The score of this movie was not at all creative. The composer seems to have grabbed a piano, sat at one edge and pressed a few random keys individually and recorded that for 30 seconds. At first, I didn't think the score was all that bad - it at least fits with the emotional time of the film - however when I realised that the piano would stop, and five seconds later start again from the beginning, and continue this throughout the entire film, every time I heard the first couple notes I would burst out laughing once again.I also laughed a lot at the cuts throughout middles of scenes. The camera that was used in the film only filmed 32 seconds with every take, and so every time a scene is longer than that, it cuts out. For the most part, that wouldn't have been a problem if everything on set freezed while they started the new take, however it's completely obvious that the actors decided to take yet another shot of LSD and the camera men decide to put the camera down for a while before picking it back up.The editing of this movie was done with minimal effort. A scene which involves lots of emotion will suddenly cut to a bunch of stationary people who wait a few seconds, and then go back into character. Simple editing mistakes can be forgiven, however when the actors haven't even got into character yet, shouldn't it be common sense that the editor cuts out all irrelevant content? Unless, of course, they were trying to make their film longer.In summary, if you plan on watching this film with the mindset of a serious film critic: don't. It won't be worth your time. While this film was created with the intention of being serious, the cast and crew were mainly high on LSD. Take it with a grain of salt and enjoy it for what it is, not what it could have been.",

            "content": "***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Well folks, it does not get any worse than this. Being a long time viewer of terrible/cheesy/campy films most of my life, I can safely say that this \"movie\", if you can call it that, is an exercise in how NOT to make a movie. Every aspect, whether on the technical side or the acting side makes most first year film student's efforts look like Gone With the Wind. Therefore, it is not suprising that this movie was written, directed, produced and starred one named Hal P. Warren. Who is Mr. Warren, you say? Well, he was a Texas Fertilzer salesman. The following review will show you why his movie and business were mirror images of each other and why it cannot really contain spoilers.First, the \"plot\". Do NOT hold your breath on this one. There is none. The movie starts out with a family consisting of Incomptent Dad (Hal P. Warren - who'd thunk?), Hysterical Mom, little girl (who must have been scarred for life for being in this movie) and pooch going on vacation, to a place called the Valley Lodge. This lodge is located about 50 meters to left side of the planet Pluto. Hence, the first 15 minutes of this movie is NOTHING but stock footage of the family driving past country fields. They drive and drive and drive and after awhile, you will get carsick. Finally, they get lost and come across a little ramshackle house. Waiting to greet them is one of the most memorable characters in movie history, Torgo. Torgo is supposed to be a half-man/half-goat, a satyr. The movie makes this look authentic by having Torgo wear watermelons in his pants. (REAL SCARY!) Torgo has many memorable lines such as, \"I am Torgo, I take care of place the when the mAsTeR is away!\" and \"There is no way out of here, it will be dark soon, there is no way out of here.\" Torgo also speaks in a sort of drunken sign-song voice that sounds half stoned, half like he is straining on the toilet.Anyway, Incompetent Dad overcomes the protests of the others and convinces Torgo to let them stay the night, since \"It will be dark soon.\" After about another 20 minutes of nothing, Incompetent Dad and Hysterical Mom see a painting of the Master, who looks like Frank Zappa after a rough night. After this, the pooch wanders off and is eaten by the Master's Hell Beast and the little girl stumbles across the Master and his \"wives\", clad in sheer nightgowns, all sleeping on stone slabs, in I assume, the backyard of the house. Well, the Master (who I think is supposed to be some sort of evil priest) wakes up, speaks into a cloud of smoke and intones the Will of Manos all the while throwing up his hands that show off his funky zippered black robe complete with funky red hands emblazoned on them. His wives then wake up, start arguing, then get into a wrestling match that only Jerry Springer could admire.While all of this is going on, Torgo makes a clumsy, drunken pass at Hysterical Mom, Incompetent Dad is hit over the with Torgo's walking stick and tied to a tree. After this, Torgo (did I mention he is killed THREE times in this movie?!), goes back to the house, has the Master \"kill\" him by having a staff waved in front of him, and is taken back to the wives who then massage him to death on one of the stone slabs. However, he is not really dead. So, the Master makes sure he will leave the house by burning his hand off. Torgo then runs out of the scene and the movie. Finally, after all of this, the Master and his wives start going after the family. Incompetent Dad wakes up, free himself, gets his gun, gathers his family and tells them to get back into the house because, he says, IT IS THE SAFEST PLACE. Mother of God!! Predictably, the Master captures them, Incompetent Dad becomes the new Torgo, and the wife and little girl become new wives for the Master. (Rather sick when you think about it)By the way, there is a couple who sit in a car and make out throught the entire movie, while constantly being pestered by two local redneck cops. This has NOTHING to do with the movie, but it is there anyway. Another testimony to the lunacy of this film.Second, the techincal lapses. The film quality is poor because all they had was a hand cranked DMV-type camera that could only record 30 seconds of film at a time. In one scene during the driving sequence the camera dissolves into the exact same scene. And the color prints are as faded as a red shirt going through 50 washings in Clorox 2. The camera also could not record sound, therefore, all voices were dubbed in later by Warren and his wife and this is VERY evident. Also, the acting is on par with a kindergarten play and is as wooden as Louisville Slugger baseball bat. And one more interesting fact. \"Manos\" in Spanish means \"hands\". So, the real title of this movie is \"Hands, the Hands of Fate\".Seeing that this is usually rated as the worst movie ever made on the Internet Movie Database, I must concur. However, I give this one a 1, only because of Torgo and the fact that Mystery Science Theatre 3000 made this a classic episode. For how bad it is, this movie is a must see. Score: 1/10",

Well, at least his films have niceties like actors, studios, plot, budgets, sound technicians and cameras that can shoot more then 30 seconds of film at a time. Well, you won't find anything like that in \"Manos\", a film that breaks all boundaries, and even crosses into other planes of existence with dreadfulness.I really don't know weather or not I can call it a \"film\" in any conventional sense. you see, even though you know it can't be true in the back of your mind, it looks an awful lot like a home movie. No joke. the lead actor and director/writer share the same last name, the \"actors\" seem like they are aunts and nieces called in on favors, and the movie had to have its sound edited in later (using only three voices for everyone).I don't know where to start. a script that seems like it was up as they went along, no motives for anyone to do anything and... what? the \"scary\" scenes? Oh, dear lord. the best parts of the movie, really. the \"sacrifice\" scene had me screaming with laughter, I won't spoil it for you. Ah, and how could I forget Torgo. he servant of Manos, he completely steals the show. with his cracking voice, bloated thighs and hunched over gait, he is truly a cult celebrity, and the best actor in Manos, too (not saying much).Manos is not something that can be described, nor can it be properly reviewed. It is an experience, one you must have for yourself. It also makes a good stocking stuffer for someone whom you would like to see dead, but haven't the guts to do 'em in yourself.",

I would add that it at least can redeem itself with a somehow consistent storyline. But either way, it is much possible among the POORLIEST PRODUCED movies by far. The shots are rarely focused, the editing is mangled, the actors often seems without any directions (notice one shot where the daughter should be asleep but get up and leave the room for no good reason!), and while it could be classified as weird nothing is ever sexy of mysterious as it probably was intended as. The worst problem is still the sound though, with a primitive, under-casted dubbing that makes it really difficult to figure out who's supposed to say what in most dialog scenes!But all things aside, there is a concluded plot that even features a single surprise, something other movies are lacking. If the filmmaker knew what he was doing, maybe this could've been a... eh, passable horror movie? But then again, would we be talking about it today?Originally The Hand was barely released, which in itself is an achievement, and then forgotten for generations. Today everyone seems to know about it and have an opinion that rarely differs. Even though many will claim that they hate it, they must've wanted to see it in the first place.

            "content": "How do you begin critiquing the worst movie ever made? Entertainment Weekly recently gave it a decent shot, though their article focused more on the history and making-of. Here is my take on this wonderful piece of cinematic horror.In what is perhaps the most delicious coincidence of all time, Manos was directed by a fertilizer salesman. Yes, a fertilizer salesman. His name is Hal Warren. The film sank into well-deserved obscurity after its 1966 release, not to be unearthed until the television show Mystery Science Theater 3000 dug it from the depths of B-moviedom. Devoted to making fun of awful movies, the comedy team didn't realize they were creating a cultural phenomenon.Chances are, if MST3K creator Joel Hodgson and his gang hadn't found Manos, no one would have been aware of its existence. A few of its flaws are obvious upon first glance: the ineptitude of the title, for instance, which translates to Hands: The Hands of Fate. I can't help what wonder what would have happened if the film made it to international release. Would they have called it Hands: Las Manos del Sino? And needless to say, it is never made clear exactly what (or who) the hands of fate are supposed to be.Oftentimes, people who are involved in the production of MST3K fodder complain that the show didn't do their films justice. The brains behind Manos had the good sense not to do this, and for great reason: the uncut, un-riffed version of the film is no better than the MST3K'd one. In fact, it is much, much worse.It's the story of a vacationing family who is forced to stay at a creepy old house because their car broke down. So far, so good. The guy who lives there is a mumbling bearded fellow (as the MST3K team put it, he \"looks like a chainsaw sculpture\") with huge, deformed knees. (As it turns out, he's supposed to be a satyr, but they only show his paper-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 hooves once. In the MSTed version, the row of \"theater seats\" makes them invisible.) He speaks constantly about \"The Master.\" His two trademark lines are \"I am Torgo. I take care of the house while the Master is away\" and \"the Master would not approve.\" He grudgingly allows the family to stay in the house, even though, surprisingly, \"the master would not approve\".Then, all hell breaks loose. Literally.Actually not, unless you count women in diaphanous gowns fighting each other to be \"hell\". As it turns out, The Master (Tom Neyman) is a member of the undead. He worships a god called Manos, or something. He has a ton of wives, also undead, who like to sit around and have loud, semi-coherent arguments that consist mostly of single-syllable words. Sometimes they wrestle. Of course. At some point it becomes clear that The Master wishes to keep Mrs. Generic Horror Movie Heroine as his own. But so does Torgo! Oh noes! Whatever will they do? Fortunately Torgo is limited to traveling at about 2 inches per hour, thanks to his immobile knees. It's not really a fair fight.Stuff happens. Unlike most bad horror movies, this doesn't even have a happy ending. Only pain and darkness await. All the voices are dubbed - badly - because the video camera that Warren used couldn't record sound. Torgo speaks as if someone is jabbing him repeatedly in the throat. But the crowning glory, I think, is the elegant speech made by The Master's oldest wife as they all argue about whom to kill: \"Man, yes! Girl, no!\" To which MST3K's Crow T. Robot quips, \"Cheese? Maybe!\" Cheese indeed.",

However, the movie itself is one of the rare movies that can cause you physical pain the keep watching. No matter how bad you thought some movie was because no-one could act and the plot was cheesy, just say to yourself, \"at least they had multiple sets, a special effects budget, and more than 2 people doing the dialog\". because such joys hang upon Manos like a new steaming dog turd in the middle of an already turd-covered field. you are going to either rate this movie a 1 or a 10. A 1 if you watched the movie, and a 10 if you didn't but want to up-vote this out of the way of \"Kazaam\".",

I've rarely seen such a thoughtful review on a message board site. Most of the time, people either gush about how great a movie was or gripe about what a miserable failure it was. I've been guilty myself of doing both in the past. I've also managed to write some balanced, thoughtful reviews too. It's not easy to do, especially if you have very strong feelings either negative or positive about the film. This Alienator person should be a professional movie critic like Roger Ebert if he or she isn't one already.Personally, I find the non MSTK version of this film to be very bad, but not the worst ever. The MSTK version is quite funny at times due to the trio's antics. I won't go so far as to say that it is the worst film of all time though. Like Alienator, I agree that given the conditions the film was created under and the skill of the filmmakers it's actually an amazing achievement that the film is still well known after all these years. Think of all the bigger budgeted, better casted films that have been made that have been all but forgotten. \"Dr. Who and the Daleks\" anyone? I'm a Dr. Who fan and own many of the TV episodes and movies including this one and even I think the movie is pretty horrible. I'm not sure that a non-Who fan could stand to watch it. How they ever got the great Peter Cushing to be in it is beyond me. Must have been really low on money.Or how about the great Orson Welles' version of Macbeth? He worked on it for a very long time and was never able to make a polished movie out of it. I really like most of Welles' work but Macbeth is terrible. Talk about poor editing, timing, lighting etc. The only saving grace of the entire film is Orson's acting. Every other aspect of the film is pretty bad. It was made early in his career and he was still learning. The main difference between Welles and the guy who directed Manos is that Welles didn't give up after his early attempts and kept trying and got better. Maybe with enough encouragement, funds and a lucky break or two the guys who made Manos could have done better in future movies instead of giving up after their first one.",

In \"Manos\" it's a family (mother, father, small daughter, her poodle) trying to find a hotel called \"The Valley Lodge\"; they get lost in their black '65 Ford convertable and instead find a smallish house off a dirt road with a caretaker who might be a Satyr who is named Torgo. He is the servant to an undead magician/cult leader called The Master who worships a god named Manos, and his cult are his undead brides, all dressed in goofy white robes. The Master wears a black robe with the outline of red hands and his facial hair makes him resemble Bill Buckner. The \"plot\" is the family finding out just how crazy the situation is, and trying to get away. Unlike most horror films of the mid-1960s, it has a downbeat ending.Why I gave the film four stars was that they shot it on 16mm home movie cameras, on their own time, and it took SIX MONTHS to make a 60-plus minute film. That's dedication. \"Manos\" had a shadowy run on the Southern drive-in circuit, joined the raft of B-movies sold to independent UHF TV stations in the 1970s, and would have been utterly obscure had not Frank Conniff of \"Mystery Science Theater\" not found it. \"Manos\" is the perfect example of the self-financed, independent regional film (El Paso, Tx.), and should be shown in film schools for how not to make those sorts of pictures.",

Especially in the beginning while watching them drive around the countryside kissing at the same time. Anyway, I saw the MST 3K version, and despite of the boredom, found it rather funny. To be honest, I can't even remember when I laughed as much as when I saw this. I don't know if it was for the plot or the partially funny comments, but I just simply liked it (I wouldn't use the word love because it'd surely be exaggeration). The reason why I'm not willing to give it a straight 10, is because of it's dullness and repetition. Some parts of the plot were clearly copied from earlier horror movies as everyone can probably notice. In a whole, the plot was also extremely confusing and I had enough trouble keeping up with what was going on. After all, I'd call Manos a part of common knowledge and a movie everyone should see to understand what makes (almost) every other movie in the world better than this one.",

I found myself envying the dog, who disappears at minute 5 of the idea (and at about 0:53 in Manos time).It could be salutary to require all serious film students to study Manos before commencing their first projects.

That role is played in the self-conscious style that is usually reserved for sighted actors playing blind people or average intellects playing developmentally disabled ones.Whenever people criticize amateur theatric productions, I remind them that this (and other badfilms) were made by professionals.

The astonishing fact that Manos never won a single award for the positive aspects of its filmmaking led to several famous actors refusing to work ever again, even though they were not involved in the project. After Manos, the outrage was so virulent a strain that Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper, and Ed Wynn never acted after its release.At heart of the Manos saga is the story of Torgo. His character represents the need of all of us to love and be loved, and the pain we all feel when caught leering at the wives of stranded motorists. Torgo was, alas, ahead of his time - the homoerotic allusion between Torgo and The Master was to be the framework for the Williams/Lane relationship in The Birdcage and the Doggett/Skinner tension in the X-Files.Sadly, the Academy has repeatedly denied Warren a Thalberg award for this work. It lives on through countless showings among devoted fans, where we can at last understand Manos' beloved vision.",

A really terrible score possibly the worst use of music in a movie ever. The way music follows Torgo around is very odd indeed.The plot or lack of it has to make this the worst movie ever after 30 minutes in i decided to go through what had actually happened; family going on holiday, couple kissing in a car to the dissatisfaction of the police, meet Torgo, look at picture of the master, nothing really happens and when something happens it happens with no logic at all.The script and acting also makes this film the worst ever with exceptional note on the character of Torgo (John Reynolds).I could go on but i think by now you should have got the picture of what I'm trying to put across this is th worst film ever.

Actually I don't have much to say about it's poor acting, non-existent plot or completely irrelevant \"the make-out couple\". I am going to evaluate the movie in a completely different manner. Think about this: years after our time, mankind is completely eradicated from the face of the earth. And some kind of alien species finds the earth and decides to send an expedition team to discover if any kind of intelligent life form exists. And during their search,they find \"Manos the hands of fate\" and somehow manage to watch it. Wouldn't they think they are wasting their time researching a species (us) that created this movie (and possibly enjoyed) as a form of art? There will be no one else to explain that this is the worst movie ever! And they will leave us to our fate! Mankind will be forgotten forever. So, I'm saying that Manos is not just a bad movie, It's a crime against humanity.",

And by great, I mean that in the worst possible sense.  A totally unexplained, freakish character with minimal lines and the acting skills of a first-grader is usually frustrating and annoying.  Well, he is frustrating and annoying, but in an amusing, intriguing, why-the-hell-are-his-thighs-like-that kind of way!There are vast stretches of time in the film where the characters are just driving through a barren wasteland.  Nothing beautiful, no purpose to the repetitive drive.  It just makes you wonder what was going through the film-makers' minds when they wrote, produced and directed this film.  Not to mention the actors who signed on to play these people.  (Poor Torgo man)For some reason I both hate and love this movie.  It's hard not to like something that is so utterly ridiculous it makes you laugh when it is obviously trying to be dead serious and scary.  You just can't NOT laugh at \"the master\" in his hand cloak.  Or the strange, unexplained lady slaves fighting in their white gowns.  And what is this man \"the master\" of? Why is Torgo with him?  If he has all these scantily-clad ladies with him, wrestling, why does he need a creepy, dirty minion with legs akimbo? It's all part of the magic and misery of Manos: Hands of Fate!",

Although \"Ax'em\" and Pocket ninja's managed to beat Manos out in my opinion the movie was truly a feat of epic proportions. For the life of me I cant figure out what Torgo was all about.

The movie is slow, the plot is as paper-thin as toilet paper (not the two layered kind), the suspense is non-existing, and the ending is un-imaginative.This movie was supposed to be a horror\\thriller, but has become a joke beyond belief.

The acting was as bad as a high school play. the setting in the film looked like the budget of $1.34. There were some parts in the movie that made my IQ drop by 12%. from a group of women having what seems to be like a 12 minute cat fight ( to me, probably 2 hours). I was so pleased when the whole family didn't make it to the end.

If it is not already, Manos should be required viewing in every film school. Why? Because if understanding and learning from the mistakes of others are valid methods in education, then one could spend an entire semester studying this film and not make it through the first 15 minutes. The mistakes, goofs, and blunders in this film are so numerous and extensive in their scope and severity as to make it the de facto \"Bible of don'ts\" for film production; the absolute gold standard of ineptitude; the Titanic of movie disasters. If Director Harrold Warren's intent from the onset was to create a 74-minute collage of all the mistakes that had ever been made in film (and even invent a few new ones), then his genius truly is on the Spielberg or Hitchcock level. As romantic as it might be to hope such is the case, the cold reality is that Warren was actually trying to produce a legitimate horror film. Well, at least the genre is fitting. This film is indeed horrific (though not in the sense that Warren intended). Pick any measure by which films may be critiqued; directing, acting, editing, script, cinematography, post-production, equipment, lighting, sound, continuity, set design. Watching Manos is wildly entertaining in the context of its epic failures in every single one of these, or any other category you care to name. I gave the movie one star on IMDb because they wouldn't let me give it zero. I won't go into specifics about the film's specific shortcomings because there are just too many, and, as so many others before me have said, there simply are no words. I will say this, though, the character Torgo is by far, I repeat, BY FAR, the most ridiculous villain ever! If you have not already seen this gem, please do. Although for first-timers I highly recommend viewing it in the MST3K version\u0085.until you've built up your tolerance a little.

            "content": "Being near the top of the bottom 100 list here at IMDB seems to have given this trash heap (and several other cinematic travesties) a lot of sympathy from numerous folks. Well, disregard them. Please, please do. Don't subject yourself to the pain that is MANOS - the Hands of Fate.This film is truly the WORST movie I have ever seen, in all my years. I know that's not something that should be thrown around very lightly - it's a pretty big statement. But in all honesty, I think I'm dead-on in the assumption that no film is as bad as this trash. I've watched numerous other no-budget Blockbuster-bargain-bin slashers, I've seen a LOT of random, obscure B-movies on MST3K and from other random sources, I've exposed myself to oldschool drive-in fluff. But none of it, NONE, has truly come close to the awful experience of seeing this movie.Marketed as a horror movie, MANOS would have been a hit with a switch-a-roo in its genre - selling it to insomniacs as a cure would have been very successful. The film starts off with a father (Director, Writer, Producer, and Fertilizer Salesman Hal Warren), A mother (who didn't live long after the completion of this movie), a daughter, and her little poodle. It isn't long (actually, yes, it is. And I do mean it is. For about 20 minutes at the beginning of the film all that happens is soft elevator music plays as the group drives across the fields of Texas in midday. And it goes on. And on. And on. Oh, the pain.) before... wait, where was I? Oh yeah, this movie sucks.After the painfully boring and devoid-of-dialogue opening driving scenes, we meet a couple of teens necking out on the highway. A cop stops them (hey, it's 1966,) and they go off to neck somewhere else. They really never had any significance that I can remember, but I read that they were going to have bigger parts until the gal in the car broke her leg. So writer/director/farmer Warren thought it'd be nice to still have them 'cameo' or something. Either way, the scenes still suck. But that leads me to the next point. MANOS was shot with a camera that records no sound - that's right, every line was dubbed by 2 people. A man, and a woman. This results in terrible voiceovers (the little girl actually sounds like a 40 year old woman mocking a 5 year old toddler, and hillarity unintentionally ensues when Hal is pulled over by a cop and you can't tell who's talking because the same person dubbed their voice). On other audio issues, while the music doesn't itself suck, per se, it is absolutely out of place in a 'horror' movie. The elevator music is out of place at the beginning. The Torgo theme could have been memorable if it had been used in more memorable places. The jazzy solos don't help the 'horror' movie at all, and the whacky music that plays during the scenes where the wives beat each other up certainly doesn't make anyone scared (and, in fact, makes it reminiscent of old silent comedy films that had similar music.)The script is ineptly written, the acting is terribly done (most people in this movie either killed themselves or never appeared in films after this one, or both,) there is no spooky, thrilling, scary, or even unintentionally funny atmosphere throughout the whole piece. It's almost physically painful to watch the actors stumble through the film, and the dubbed voiceovers (and it shows that the dubbers really did try to fit each part, but failed miserably) all add up to a terrble experience. In my movie watching experiences it's often that I find horrible movies that make me laugh. I'm sure many others have similar experiences, but this film is devoid of any of that.There is truly not a single redeeming quality in this film. Spare yourself the pain. Truly the worst movie I've ever seen - 0/10",

No it wasn't well made. The production values sucked. The acting (thanks most probably from the dubbing) wasn't spectacular.. But the movie was great. It imbodied the central idea of an independant film.It showed us that even a fertilizer salesman from El Paso can make a film that gains any sort of status (in this case, cult status.)Sure, Hal Warren's dead and gone, but \"Manos\" is still here, it lives on, and look at where it is now? It was on MST3K, and the main reason why any of us really know the movie exists. You can go online or to your local video retailer and pick up the MST3K version. Heck, oldies.com is selling the original version of it.What I think \"Manos\" really stood for was that anybody could make a movie. Hal Warren did in 1966, and it's something people still do today. Sure it's more difficult now. But look at Lloyd Kauffman and Troma entertainment. He's doing the same thing now that Warren did in '66, and people love his stuff.If anything, that's what \"Manos\" is a good movie for... That and Torgo.

Have you ever seen a really terrible movie and thought that the director actually wanted it to be bad because audiences will find humor in a movie that is so bad it is funny? Yeah, well that's not the case with this movie. I have a feeling that this director actually thought that this was a good film. To start, the film is called Manos: Hands of Fate, which translates to Hands: Hands of Fate. Ummm, okay. Next, the voice track rarely matched the actors mouth movements. The writer, who also happened to be the director, couldn't come up with anything better, so he had an overwhelming amount of establishing shots. For example, we see these painfully long scenes in which doomed travelers are driving around the bare countryside, and a couple of teens are making out- over, and over, and over. To me, and I venture to say most folks, these are simply bad time fillers. The plot, which jumps all over the place and really makes little to no sense, is ridiculous. The dialogue is repetitious and inane, and the actors seem to be at a loss as to how to present such a poor script. And finally, as if that wasn't enough, the camera work is terrible. You might as well see a boom mic hanging out, since there are several instances in which heads are chopped off or something blocks the actors in the frame (i.e. smoke). Really, this is the worst movie ever made.However, I will say that there is one way to enjoy this movie: watch it with a group of friends, and in particular, watch the Mystery Science 3000 version of this film.

I guess it could be improved - if you had an entirely new script-director-cameraman-sound technician-cast etc although I'm not sure why removing the \"cat fight\" portion would make it any better since that alone had to be the high point of the whole movie.A lot of bad movies can be fun, of course. \"It - The Terror from Beyond Space\" is one of the worst science fiction films ever made in the 1950's but it is a scream; literally a howler. Scenes of male \"astronauts\" looking like a bunch of middle-aged teamsters sitting around their \"break room\" smoking cigarettes while the \"lady astronauts\" clear away dishes and serve coffee will have you laughing your ass off.There are few such gems to be found in Manos. It really is just a unfortunate boring piece of crap.",

When I think \"bad\" I think \"B\" movie grade, which actually has a plot, a somewhat coherent storyline, bad acting, and a budget smaller than your brother's weekly allowance. The only thing Manos succeeds in is failing to meet even a low standard in any category. I had to watch this movie in two parts; now, I've completed 10 mile runs before (with respectable times), but this movie felt like an absolute MARATHON. This movie was torture of the worst kind. I think this movie actually classifies as horror for the simple fact that when you get done watching it, you realize in absolute HORROR that you lost a few hours of your life that would have best been used elsewhere. Writing this post telling how bad the movie was is actually a better use of my time than actually watching the movie. SLEEPING is a better use of your time than watching this \"movie\".",

I'll start by listing off a few things that make this movie garbage: The 35mm camera used in filming does not record sound. But ingeniously Hal Warren found a way around that, he, another man and their wives dubbed over the voices of every character. Often times there will two characters speaking to each other and have the same voice. So it's just one person talking! The dubbing doesn't even match the actors' lip/mouth movements at times.The movie is full of sometimes ten minute periods of nothing happening. NOTHING. A perfect example of this is when the movie opens you will have to watch a nine minute driving sequence before the opening credits role.There are many times when the movie is focusing on a couple making out in their car. In fact they are necking for the entire course of the movie, as you will see when the movie flashes back to them pointlessly time and time again.The story is very bland, but the ending is unpredictable and astonishing, I'll leave that to be discovered and won't spoil it for you.Now I want to talk about Torgo. Torgo believe it or not, has a large following. He's such a lovable character too! With his \"goat legs\", which were accomplished by having actor John Reynolds wear over-sized pants and walk strangely. But I truly believe that John Reynolds had potential as an actor, as bad as the movie was, I loved Torgo and his actor.I believe everybody should see this movie, on the purpose to see how bad a movie can truly get, and I definitely recommend the Myster Science Theater 3000 version.",

If you're a big MST3K fan, you've seen movies like \"The Sky Divers\" \"Red Zone Cuba\" \"The Beast of Yucca Flats\" the big three Coleman Francis films.While this is not the worst movie ever thought of and turned into a \"movie\" (and I use the term VERY loosely), it deserves the credit of being the worst movie ever.Now, I've only seen the MSTied version of this movie (I'm not about to shell out fifteen bucks for a piece of trash like this) but I am sure that they couldn't have cut out too much valuable plot-related film.After all, the driving scene (thirty minutes of pure terror) was probably cut a little to save time, and did anyone really miss an extra few minutes of it?They cut out the scene showing Torgo's goat legs (hence the big knees and funny walk) but that wasn't too relative to the plot.Aside from the time-saving edits, the guys at MST3k did a service to humanity by bringing this \"film\" into the public light.  This really wasn't the worst movie ever created.  But if you're sitting through it and you haven't experienced such classic MSTied movies like \"The Starfighters\" and \"Future War\", it definitely will feel like the worst movie ever.I actually think it has a decent plot, and if it were made today (by someone competent) it could probably be turned into something fairly watchable. The actor that played Torgo did a really good job (and I liked the guy that dubbed his voice) and \"The Master\" was actually a villain that could probably scare a small child.But, aside from the decent acting from those two, and a reasonably decent plot, this movie is *one* of the worst of all time.  Movies like those Coleman Francis gems have less plot, less acting, and less...everything, than `Manos,' and therefore, they are some of the worst of all time.But `Manos' should be number one on the Bottom All-time list, not because it IS the worst of all time, but because it deserves the notability of being the BEST bad movie ever created.",

The negative criticisms and those slamming it as the worst movie ever do not lie, Manos: The Hands of Fate is as bad as all that. There is such thing as a terrible movie that has novelty comic value, but there is also such thing as a movie that is too inept to take that into consideration. Some will disagree, but I consider Manos: The Hands of Fate as a good example of the latter. To call the way the movie is made amateurish is being too kind, the camera work and editing are all over the place and makes anything that happens incomprehensible. The visual effects are dated and make everything even more artificial than it already is, while the bizarre and often out of sync sound effects and a score that is shrill and monotonous are enough to make your ears bleed. And even when your poor ears are suffering enough, they are assaulted even more by dialogue that is stilted, insultingly cheesy and too talky and some of the worst and annoying acting ever in film history. The villain is quite possibly the most laughable and underwhelming villain ever and you'd be hard pressed to find one that is worse-acted than here. Torga is the best thing about Manos: The Hands of Fate, but that's saying nothing as he's still irritating. The direction is so flat that you have to look hard to find evidence of any direction at all, while the story is incredibly thin and is so plodding that you're dying of boredom. In conclusion, hopelessly inept. 0/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Manos: The Hands of Fate is the story of a family who become lost while driving thought the West Texas desert and are menaced by a polygamous cult. It also a strong contender for the title of worst movie ever made. With glacial pacing, a threadbare plot, very little that could be described as acting, no real production values to speak of, and nothing remotely scary or exciting, it's a near perfect example of how not to make a movie.\n\nThis makes a lot a lot of sense once you know the story behind the movie. You see, Manos was written, directed, and produced by an El Paso insurance salesman with no experience in film or acting, in order to win a bet that he could make a movie. He did this with a near zero budget, a cast of community theater volunteers and random townspeople, and the absolute minimum of editing and post-production work possible. He won his bet, but seeing the result, you'll seriously wonder if it was worth it. \n\nAt least the first five minutes consist of the family driving aimlessly around the desert, passing the same amorous teenage couple again and again, in what may be the most pointless, meandering opening sequence ever put on film. Apparently, this was supposed to be a leisurely opening credits sequence, but the filmmakers ran out of money to add the credits, and just left it in to pad the runtime. It drags on and on, going nowhere, adding nothing to the story, until they finally reach the Master's house. Sadly, this brings very little improvement in plot or pacing.\n\nInstead we're mainly treated to slow, awkward conversations, aborted attempts to leave the Master's house for somewhere safer, and even more shots of that teen couple making out in their car. The closest thing this movie has to a high point is the extended catfight between the Master's nightgown clad wives, but even this gets boring after the first couple minutes. You know you're in trouble when you can't make gratuitous exploitation work.\n\nAs with any bad horror movie, the characters spend far too much time wandering around looking for each other, calling out each other's names over and over with no reply. You wouldn't think it would take them so long to find each other in such a small house in the absolute middle of nowhere. Then again, it is pretty dark, and these people aren't very bright. \n\n Now the reason it's so dark is that in order to accommodate the cast and crew's day jobs, most shooting was done at night. Only they didn't have the budget for proper lighting, so most of the exterior scenes are pitch black. Hence the scene in which police hear gunshots, walk a few steps from their car to investigate, then turn around and give up because it's too dark to see anything. The lack of production values is even more apparent when one of the night scenes cuts to a piece of stock footage- instantly recognizable as such because it's better lit and photographed than any other part of the movie.\n\nIf there is any redeeming value to this production beyond sheer camp, it's John Reynold's one of a kind performance as Torgo, the Master's slow talking, long suffering henchman and housekeeper. I'm not saying it's a good performance. In fact, it's about as far from anything resembling a good performance as can be imagined. But between his stilted, halting speech, jerking movements, and near constant facial tics, Reynold's acting is so awful, so creepy, in such a uniquely bizarre way, that it's almost hypnotic. Like a Beatnik version of Nic Cage, he's either manic or semi-comatose in every scene. No one could possibly be this terrible on purpose, and I was not at all surprised to learn that he was in fact a heavy drug user.\n\nThe other performances are also uniformly bad, but aside from a few amusingly overwrought outbursts from the Master, only in the flat, boring manner of the entire movie. It's kind of amazing that it takes over ninety minutes for so little to happen, or that what's supposed to be a horror movie can be so utterly devoid of anything remotely scary. It does manage to be intermittently creepy, but only in all the wrong ways, as in the deeply unwholesome final scene, which I can only hope the filmmakers didn't realize the full undertones of.\n\nThe whole thing is just an utter mess of earnest intentions colliding with woeful ineptitude, like Ed Wood minus the minor celebrities and special effects. It's slow, boring, disjointed, frequently bizarre, and completely botched on every imaginable level. If there is a lesson to this movie, it's that just because you can do something, it doesn't mean you should. I cannot recommend the original cut, even to the most committed bad movie lovers. However, I can recommend the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment, which makes for a rather amusing, relatively painless introduction to the cult of Manos.",

            "content": "Okay, so this movie is bad.  We can all agree on that.  Instead of telling you why, let me make the case for a reboot of this film and how it should go.\n\n1. The remake needs to be over-budget and directed by Michael Bay.  It must have gratuitous special effects that add nothing to the plot nor the overall believability of the film.  In fact, a failure to suspend of disbelief is a requirement just like the original.\n2. The dialog from Hal Warren's screenplay cannot be changed under any circumstances.\n3. The original failed to make the beginning of the film as boring as it really could have been.  The landscape must not match any recognizable region of the US or Europe, and must nonsensically transition from temperate to desert in order to isolate the rule of isolation that should be the main theme of this film.\n4. Because a reboot of this film would be set in the 21st Century, no cell phone nor satellite service is a must. However, whoever remakes this film should fail to capitalize on this and any other themes including seclusion, isolation, or loneliness.  As tempting as it would be to any sensible person to explore the loneliness of Torgo's character, this easy opening to develop character needs to be avoided as it was in the original.\n5. Characters:\nMichael has to be an idiot without being idiotic, he has to be condescending without emoting condescension, and he was to be unsurprisingly average without seeming to be overtly average nor inept.  A younger Kevon Costner-type should have play this role.\n\nThe actress who plays Margaret should be billed as beautiful, but only has not look unattractive. Her character does not have to exude sexiness nor does it have to attract.  Her job in the original and the remake is to be feminine.  When Torgo hits on her awkwardly, she should not emote any reaction whatsoever except to eventually catch on that Torgo is making a pass at her.  In fact, the less cerebral this scene is made, the better.\n\nThe child or dog can be any random child or dog-looking animal who can take simple direction (sit, stand, say something...).  In fact, all they have to do is to fit the \"lost thing\" paradigm and there has to be some amount of sympathy for their having been lost or killed.  These two roles can be played by any animal-like organism that would elicit some sense of loss of they were no longer there. The Second Unit production crew can handle filming their parts.  As such, there's no need to cast anyone known for these two parts; the film's money should be wasted elsewhere.\n\nThe Master needs NOT to be played by a washed-up actor looking to rehabilitate their acting career -- any interesting backstory within the film or beyond the fourth wall would make the role and the film too compelling and interesting.  In fact, the actor who plays the role of the really evil Master needs to be less interesting in person than they appear in the painting Michael and Margaret encounter shortly after entering the dwelling.\n\nIn an era or Political Correctness, Torgo cannot be handicapped.  That's not a bad thing because any handicap would make a case for a meaningful backstory.  Torgo has to be just odd and just odd should suffice.  Any more than that would make would diminish his meager backstory (the only meaningful backstory in the original film) of being infatuated with the Master's wives.  That is the driver of this film:  not the sense of isolation, not what made him have intensely swollen and misshapen legs, not the fact that he strange accent which might make it interesting if we found out he was was somewhere else, or event the fact that he carries a staff.  Its my belief that Torgo is should really treated Radagast from the \"Lord of the Rings\" books and not the fully-developed version Peter Jackson developed in \"The Hobbit.\"  Just some guy in brown (or khaki) with a hat and a staff who bathes infrequently and isn't from around those parts.  That's being generous and maybe too much so.\n\nMegan Fox needs to chick who makes out with the guy who gets caught like 2 or 3 times by the police.  The officer should be Sting because his English accent makes the \"small-town cop\" vibe more believable if you are on intense medications and because I think Sting should do more small-bit parts in more meaningless films.  \n\nMark Wahlberg should be NOT be the dude making out with her and ANY song by Marky-Mark and the Funky Bunch SHOULD NOT be playing on the radio whilst kissing and drinking Robitussin cough syrup is done hedonistically yet without abandon.  The Hedonistic-without-Abandon is a MUST, Megan Fox is a must, and the dude should be one of the lesser-known Baldwin Brothers trying to pass himself off as being 20 years younger and yet serious.\n\nYep.  That about sums it up.",

            "content": "Manos: The Hands of Fate is legendarily bad and considered to be the worst horror movie ever made. That's quite an accomplishment considering the horror genre has a killer elevator, a trilogy about a killer cookie, one about a killer bed, and so many other goofy films more viable to take that spot. Yet regardless of being label as \"the worst horror movie of all time\" it continues to attract audiences and some even end up liking it. How could it be that what's consider trashed by the majority is treasured by many? Underneath the rough surfaces lies something that entertains for the wrong reason few bad films can.\r\n\r\nHands: The Hands of Fate on the spot improv plot is about a family getting lost on the road and stumbling upon a hidden, underground, devil-worshiping cult led by the fearsome Master and his servant Torgo. To be honest the premise could have worked it has an unconventional narrative, is unpredictable, and slowly reveals the answers to it mystery that is setup. Problem with all of these elements being the execution of them. Everything is loosely and flimsily connected by a thin thread. In fact if the character ever left the house the film would have no plot to speak off. With the exception of Torgo secondary characters are useless. A couple too cheap to afford a cheap hotel or go to their parent homes always make out publicly in a car. Easily persuadable policemen who give you a free pass on a speeding ticket if you're late and for some reason making out in public is illegal in this town or desert. Than the six wives of The Master each younger than the last. Unfortunately given the context within the film the couple daughter not being killed could be debated that the Master is a ped...better yet lets avoid that territory altogether. Also I want to meet the person who dubbed this. I'm no expert on the English language, but are you sure \"You all are mad. Mad the whole lot of you.\" is proper English. Characters have no development not even enough to be one dimensional. Each character has one trait (like being hungry) and that's about it. Now no one could talk this film without mentioning the iconic Torgo. This character is the sole reason this film thrives in awfulness. Actor John Reynold non-experience as an actor gives the character a nice touch. His awkward walk from probably smoking one too many joint, goofy facial expression, and silly line delivery adds to a layer of entertainment to his character.\r\n\r\nAs for the other area the film is a complete failure. For the first half hour the amazement of how every bad decision accumulated into a something so shockingly bad is something difficult to not want to look at. Than the second half becomes a tedious series of repetition slowly loosing its charm. The editing in this film is among the worst anyone could string together. Lines of dialogue repeat loop, awkward cuts that make you question if the copy of the film you're watching is in poor condition, and the improper timing of inserting music. For example, when first meeting Torgo \"scary\" music plays when Torgo is getting luggage from a car. It seems the clown noise someone was squeaking behind the scenes was kept in the film for some reason. Music in this film sounds like the instruments themselves were laughing. One of the most noticeable of laughing instruments is during the worst catfight ever staged is scored using a laughing Saxophone. Editing just in general is questionable. In one scene a dog goes out into the desert and is killed by what sounds like Ducks. It will leave your jaws open in how bad editing could scoop down to. As for the acting it lives up to its reputation. Actors break the forth wall looking directly in the cameras and monotone performances. Because of the poor editing you could spot clapperboards, actor getting to their location for the scene, and scenes where it's clear the actors themselves are holding the camera. As far as art direction goes it lacking evidently; the only time it chooses to expresses itself beyond limitation is The Master cape having two giant hands on it. Aside from that everything has and retains a low-budget feel.\r\n\r\nHands: Los Manos of Fate lives up to its reputation, but not entirely like how one would expect. It's devoid of any proper craftsmanship yet the cast and crew heart behind it is felt regardless how the quality turned out. There's a reason audiences go seeking this \"awful\" film and avoid atrocities such as Monster-A-Go-Go. A bad film can entertain it audiences even if how it does that is unintentional as oppose to one that doesn't. Who would wants to dig up a fifty plus year old that will infuriates them. On the surface everybody clearly sees the rough edges, but some that look past that sees an entity that brings a good time like any film attempts to do.",

But is it any worse than major Hollywood fodder where they should know better? Probably, but seeping beneath the layers of dubbing, irrelevant scenes and prolonged pauses between dialogue is a memorable and audacious attempt at proving someone wrong. Concept-wise there are elements taken from 50's and 60's horror and the acting by John Reynolds and Tom Neyman simulate and emulate fear within you,\nI refuse to believe that this is 'the worst of the worst' and pales in comparison to some other fodder churned out in cinemas since and that it is less enjoyable than Ed Wood films.\nSurely it's better to burn out than fade away, the Master would not approve of your distain towards this film.",

Warren who directed, wrote and acted in it used a hand winding camera that has visual quality no more than antique and can only film 30 seconds of footage at a time, so combined with the terrible audio quality and the senseless series of car shots in the intro and the constant flickering sound in the background and the sight of a clapperboard in frame or moths being attracted to the lighting and getting in way of the terrible film before the viewer's eyes solidifies the legacy Manos: The Hands of Fate has for being one of the most poorly crafted films in existence.\nUnfortunately, Manos: The Hands of Fate is too boring to be entertaining by its badness due to the way it features two pointless plot lines and never locks its attentions on one or lights them well enough to be seen and gains the benefit of having the most terrible boring catfight in film history. \nAnd the sight of unknown actors and a young girl dubbed in post production by an old woman is so strange, especially since the potentially LSD addicted John Reynolds is shaking so much throughout the film and forced to stutter physically and talk while the sound has been cut out so essentially it's a man intended to be a satyr suffering from what looks like Parkinson's disease but is actually just crappy direction from Hal P. Warren. \nEssentially, like many other films of the worst of all time genre, the plot just doesn't make the slightest bit of sense and is only of relevance to the word Manos through strange and terrible scriptwriting. Essentially, the characters embody no cult, massage each other to death and the entire film had some unspecified role in contributing to the suicide of lead actor John Reynolds, and the mystery surrounding that is one of the pieces of the films legacy.\nI didn't particularly hate Manos: The Hands of Fate, but there's nothing to like and it isn't even worth watching just for the stupidity. But at least Hal P. Warren won his bet and got to live out his life as a manure salesman with the pride of winning a bet against an Oscar-winning screenwriter.",
