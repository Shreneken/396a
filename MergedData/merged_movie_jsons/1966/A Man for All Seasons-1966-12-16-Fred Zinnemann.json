            "content": "A Man For All Seasons is an erudite examination of the old Biblical maxim: a man cannot serve two masters. Sir Thomas More (poignantly portrayed by Paul Scofield) struggles to be true to both his faith and his monarch (the lusty and hearty King Henry VIII superbly played by Robert Shaw). I think it is difficult for citizens in our present secular society to truly understand just how central a role religion played in a man's life during the period of the film; it was an age of faith when Christianity exerted the most powerful of influences on one's thinking. On a side note, the American Republic wisely sought a nation that \"divided church and state.\" However, the fine distinction remains that it would be a state informed by faith but not run by the church. The aforementioned exemplary performances by the leads are backed by excellent supporting turns, especially from Orson Welles as the less than saintly Cardinal Wolsey and the eternally ebullient Susannah York as Sir Thomas's daughter Margaret. This is a true masterpiece that richly deserves all the accolades and plaudits it has received.",

            "content": "This magnificent picture concerns on Sir Thomas Moro'conflict with Henry VIII . Moro(Paul Scofield, in the title role) was Henry VIII's(Robert Shaw) most able chancellor, he was a man of the Renaissance, lawyer , philosopher, writer(His most famous work was Utopia), and statesman. He was also a devoted husband and father, and, above all, a pious Catholic. Henry was well aware of Moro's brilliance and the strength of his chancellor's religious faith. When Henry proclaimed himself Head of Church, it was inevitable that the two men would clash. The origin conflict takes place when Catherine of Aragon was married to Arthur,Henry VII's older brother, Arthur died six months later, and Henry VIII marries to Catherine.Cardinal Wolsey(Orson Welles) failed to obtain the Pope's permission for Henry's marriage to Anne Boleyn and his fall was swift, he was summoned before Henry and forced to surrender his seal of office. Then Henry breaks with Catholic Church and secretly married Anne Boleyn and after creates Anglican religion. Thomas is led to council formed by Duke of Norfolk(Nigel Davenport), Archbishop Cranmer, Cromwell(Leo McKern) and Richard Rich(John Hurt). Later Moro is judged by the court, those who stood in Henry's way, even those he claimed to love, invariably ended on the scaffold.This splendid costumer-drama contains excellent performances by all star cast. Paul Scofield won deservedly Academy Award as upright chancellor with fateful destination but he was led from his cell in the Tower of London and beheaded. Outstanding Orson Welles at a brief appearance as Cardinal Wolsey and extraordinary plethora of secondaries as a young John Hurt, Wendy Hiller as his spouse Alice, Nigel Davenport as astute Duke of Norfolk, among others. And of course Robert Shaw as selfish King who discarded his first wife Catherine of Aragon and executed Anne Boleyn-Vanessa Redgrave in a very secondary role-. Colorful,luxurious scenarios by John Box with evocative cinematography by Ted Moore, also Oscar winner. The movie benefits from sensible and perceptible musical score by George Delerue.Brilliant direction by Fred Zinnemann who adapted perfectly Robert Bolt's screenplay.The story is remade in 1988, an inferior TV version directed and produced by Charlton Heston with John Gielgud as Cardenal Wolsey, again Vanessa Redgrave and Heston as Thomas Moro.",

            "review_title": "What Profit In Selling One's Soul?",
            "content": "Fred Zinnemann's one of our great forgotten directors, amazing considering that he was nominated for eight directing Oscars in four decades, winning two. Today's critics and auteurs don't champion him; you won't read much about him in \"Entertainment Weekly.\" For Zinnemann, the script was the thing, what he worked from, and his greatest genius may have been in choosing the right scripts and knowing how to do them justice.\"From Here To Eternity\" may well be Zinnemann at his highest tide, though IMDb voters seem to prefer \"High Noon.\" Then there's \"A Man For All Seasons,\" the film of the year in 1966, though its hard to imagine a film that represents the ethos of the 1960s less. \"A Man For All Seasons\" presents us with an unfashionable character who refuses to surrender his conscience to the dictates of king and countrymen, resolute instead in his devotion to God and Roman Catholic Church.\"When statesmen lead their country without their conscience to guide them, it is short road to chaos,\" Thomas More tells his nominal boss, Cardinal Wolsey, when the latter unsuccessfully presses him to give his blind assent to King Henry VIII's request for a convenient divorce. Perhaps out of pique, Wolsey makes sure More inherits his office of Counselor of the Realm, where More's sterling convictions are really put to the test.More is a marvel of subtleties, tensile steel covered in a velvet glove, a mild-mannered lion trying at every turn to do well even though his political savvy knows how dangerous that can be. As a lawyer, More knows the angles, yet he is no sharpie. He respects the law too much for that. Rather, he sees in law the only hope for man's goodness in a fallen world. \"I'd give the Devil benefit of the law, for my own safety's sake,\" he explains.Paul Scofield plays More in such a way as to make us not only admire him but identify with him, and come to value both his humanness and his spirituality. His tired eyes, the way he gently rebuffs would-be bribers around Hampton Court, his genuine professions of loyalty to Henry even as he disagrees with the matter of his divorce, all speak to one of those great gifts of movies, which is the ability to create a character so well-rounded and illuminating in his window on the human condition we find him more haunting company than the real people we meet in life. It's a gift the movies seldom actually deliver on, so when someone like Scofield makes it happen, it is a object of gratitude as much as admiration.The script, adapted by Robert Bolt from his stage play, is very literate and careful to explain the facts of More's dilemma. It moves too slowly and opaquely at times to qualify \"A Man For All Seasons\" as a true classic, that and a supporting cast full of one-note performances, though some are quite good (a few, however, are notably flat.) I especially liked Robert Shaw as a young and thin Henry VIII, full of vigor yet also a childish temperament and inconsistent mind. He demands More not oppose his marriage to Anne Boleyn, then decides he must have either More's outright assent or else his head. There's no bargaining with such a man. Perhaps More was better off standing on his principals as he did than climbing into bed with homicidal Henry. Just ask Anne.Zinnemann presents some interesting visual images in \"A Man For All Seasons,\" letting the period detail inform the story without overwhelming it. Several times, such as during the opening credits, inside More's cell at the Tower of London, and during More's trial, the camera shoots through narrow openings surrounded by high stone walls, a reminder not only of More's own trapped situation but the human condition. Aspirations of divinity may be unfashionable, even dangerous to one's health, but they present mankind with its one hope for overcoming its base nature, the dead-end character of temporality. \"A Man For All Seasons\" is a rallying cry for just such an approach to life, and remains undeniably effective in its artful, artless way.",

            "review_title": "The Ultimate Lead Performance",
            "content": "Paul Scofield's rendition of Sir Thomas More as written by Robert Bolt and directed by Fred Zinneman is the greatest lead dramatic performance EVER in cinematic history.  He is that magnificent.  He IS Sir Thomas More.  We feel his hope, weariness, fire, virtue, protectiveness, morality, and bemusement as richly as he conveys each one frequently, one right after another.  He was made for Bolt's dialogue, and Bolt's dialogue is drilled forever into our conscious by Scofield's flawless performance.Everything else is also here.  Leo McKern is brilliant as politically motivated prosecutor, Lord Cromwell.  A bit subtler, but no less brilliant is Nigel Davenport as a man of some conscience, but not quite enough.  John Hurt is unforgettable as ambitious young Rich led into temptation by Lord Cromwell.  The incomparable Dame Wendy Hiller -- who passed just last year -- adds several more dimensions than her rather sparsely written role as Scofield's wife should have allowed for.  Every minute she is on the screen is magnificent.  Susannah York walks a tightrope between being scholarly reason and her passion for what is right.  Robert Shaw as Henry VIII and Orson Wells as Cardinal Woolsey are larger than life and completely compelling during their all-too-brief virtuoso solos.  The cinematography is lush.  The soundtrack is historically accurate and perfectly positioned. Key sounds punctuate three pregnant pauses with explosive impact.  The movie is technically as perfect as an historical epic can be.  The film is simply exquisite.All that being said, as I reflect momentarily in my head on closing this, it is Scofield's incomparable and breathtaking performance which still leaves me in complete awe.",

            "content": "If on occasions I babbled about some actor's performance being the best I've ever seen it was just because I hadn't seen \"A Man For All Seasons\". Well, up until today. And I definitely won't be that quickly amazed and impressed by a performance again. May I just say that Paul Scofield embodies great acting to it's very core. Comprehending his masterful and skillful acting is evident even to the greatest fool or layman and I (not being a big expert myself) could not believe how a man can attain such knowledge of perfection. His every word is spoken with the greatest skill, intonation and accent as well as his facial expressions and movements. His performance is so strong it's scary when I think about it. As if he knew(and he most definitely did!) EXACTLY how to perform his acting task. This movie is an explosion of outstanding acting and actors, showing their skills to the fullest and to the amazed viewers. It may well be the greatest movie ever made, but the reason for this lies also in the jaw dropping and mind opening script that deserves more credit than it could have ever gotten. If you thought \"On The Waterfront\", \"Bridge On The River Kwai\", \"Glennary Glen Ross\" or even \"The Usual Suspects\" or \"Pulp Fiction\" had some great dialogs then this inspiring and simply amazing script will definitely change your mind. There are so many memorable lines, monologues and great battling dialogs I can't even give an approximate number. Every moment is meaningful and the movie is full of smart and important thoughts. I won't go into the story, because as a previous commenter said, there are just too many points of view and meanings to it, but I will say this; Sir Thomas More was too moral and too strong to give in to the Church, and because of his reasons he was respected. But because he was, for some, this stubborn, he paid the price which in the real world when you play with the big boys, is a given. A movie every future actor, actress, director and screen writer should and must see and a movie that makes most of the later Oscar winners for best picture look like a joke. And a final though, Leonard Maltin was absolutely right; if Paul Scofield acted only in this movie he'd still be remembered as a marvel worth every praise and respect. 9/10",

            "review_title": "\"This silence of his is bellowing....\"",
            "content": "One of the greatest cinematic studies of the nature of personal integrity, I sometimes think that this film is in danger of being forgotten -- and it shouldn't be. One wonders at the degree of corruption in More's time that he should have been so highly regarded for his honesty -- and how he might have been regarded today.What Robert Bolt and Fred Zinnemann had wrought is absolutely brought to glorious life by the incomparable characterization of Sir Thomas More by the chronically underrated Paul Scofield. Bringing superb support to the role are Nigel Davenport as More's close friend Norfolk, who is caught between the rock of his respect and concern for More and the hard place of his duty to (and fear of) Henry VIII; Leo McKern as the jovially sinister Thomas Cromwell, whose verbal jousts with More are virtual poetry from Bolt's pen; John Hurt as More's fair-weather friend Richard Rich; Dame Wendy Hiller as More's devoted but frustrated and misunderstanding wife; and the elegant Susannah York as his equally devoted and strong-minded daughter. Two stand-out performances in relatively small but vital roles: Orson Welles, magnetic as the shrewdly pragmatic Cardinal Wolsey; and Robert Shaw, whose energetic portrayal of a young Henry VIII (before his corpulent days!) dominates the screen the two times he's on it.As with \"The Lion in Winter,\" the remarkable scriptwriting is the driving force behind the story, but Scofield's dignified, restrained, but at the same time quietly forceful delivery are what give the writing its power. The great quotes of the film (\"Why Richard, it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the entire world...but for Wales?\" \"When you are sent to heaven for doing your conscience, and I am sent to hell for not doing mine, will you come with me, for fellowship?\" etc.) are conveyed with either enormous gravity or poignancy by nothing more than the tone of Scofield's voice.I think that the dilemma at the heart of the tale and how men of power came to grips with it is artfully summed up in the dying words of Wolsey and, of course, More. Wolsey regrets he did not serve God as well as he served his king. More, on the other hand, dies as \"His majesty's good servant...but God's first.\" Whether criticized or praised as a morality play, it's wonderful to at least HAVE an uncompromising morality play to watch from time to time -- especially one so well crafted.",

            "review_title": "Took His Catholicism Very Seriously",
            "content": "Sir Thomas More, a multi-talented man of letters and law, went to the executioner's block because he would not recognize a temporal king as head of his country's church. Though a friend of Henry VIII and his chancellor he was more afraid of offending God than the king. A man who took his Catholic faith quite seriously.Robert Bolt's play ran for 637 performances in the 1961-1963 season on Broadway and the only two who came over from the Broadway cast were Paul Scofield as More and Leo McKern as Thomas Cromwell. They present quite a contrast indeed as antagonists, Scofield the man of honor and principle and McKern as the sly intriguing Cromwell. This Cromwell was in fact the grand uncle of Oliver Cromwell and he suffered the same fate as More for finding himself out of step politically at Henry VIII's court.That's the way it was in court politics in Tudor England. You stayed in step with the monarch whims or the executioner shortened you a little bit. As Henry VIII, Robert Shaw does actually have reason to be concerned.The only American in the cast, Orson Welles as Cardinal Wolsey, explains it quite clearly. It was only 40+ years since the king's father Henry VII took the throne and reunited the York and Lancastrian claims to the crown. Previous to that for sixty years England went into a steep decline during the period known as the War of the Roses where rival factions fought for the crown. The lack of a strong male heir would guarantee such an event which was fresh in a lot of minds.Why wouldn't the Pope just find some ecclesiastical loophole and give who had been his ardent defender a divorce? Very simply Henry VIII's first wife Catherine of Aragon was the aunt of Emperor Charles V and his army was occupying Rome after the battle of Pavia a few years back. Catherine's marriage to Henry put England in the Spanish orbit and he wasn't about to let it go. Basically the Pope was going to dance to Emperor Charles's tune.Which still left Henry VIII with a dynastic problem. He made the complete break and said he was head of the Church in England. That is how the Anglican church came into being. A lot like More thought this wrong and paid with their lives.Paul Scofield won Broadway's Tony Award for playing Sir Thomas More and matched it with an Oscar for Best Actor in 1966. Scofield set a standard for playing a man willing to die for a belief. His More is a man of wit and humor, not a priggish sort by any means. It's what makes More such an appealing character and even non-Catholics can certainly appreciate his sacrifice.Besides those I've already mentioned the cast also includes Wendy Hiller as More's good wife, Susannah York as his daughter and Corin Redgrave of that great theatrical family as his somewhat bumptious, but well meaning son-in-law. Sister Vanessa is her briefly as Anne Boleyn who Henry hoped to marry to begat a son with her. For the story from her point of view see Anne of a Thousand Days or for the whole saga see the fine BBC production of their mini-series starring Keith Mitchell as Henry VIII.Besides Scofield though, my favorite in A Man for All Seasons has always been McKern. To see what a wide ranging player he was apart from being the henpecked barrister Horace Rumpole you have to see A Man For All Seasons. He plays Thomas Cromwell every bit as slimy as he has come down to us in history. Also note the presence of a young John Hurt who plays Richard Rich whose perjured testimony convicts More.A Man For All Seasons, a film for all seasons and lots of reasons.",

            "review_title": "Fantastically acted, beautifully shot",
            "content": "`A Man For All Seasons', much like the film `Becket', is about a man standing up to his king, with tragic results.  In this film the man is Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield) a well-liked and well-respected lawyer and the king is Henry VIII (Robert Shaw).  Henry VIII wants to divorce his wife and marry another, something illegal by the courts of England.  But since he is the king and he is fond of executions, practically no one objects, except More, who refuses to believe that anyone is above the law, even his king.It's not that More objects, rather that he doesn't go along with it.  He never says he's against it \u0096 because that way he could be charged with treason \u0096 but he doesn't sign the new law passed in favor of the king.  He could get away with this, of course, but Henry VIII stubbornly refuses to have any opposition, and the rest of the movie is spent on characters trying to persuade More to abide, for this reason or that.  There is also a subplot about Richard Rich (a young John Hurt) and Thomas Cromwell (Leo McKern) plotting to frame More to quiet him.That is what I got from the plot, at least.  I could be wrong.  It was hard to follow, this film, because of the fast fury of dialogue in each scene, never relenting for the audience to understand.  This fast approach to the subject matter wasn't too tedious, but it did prompt me to rewind a few times to hear things over.That, I am glad to say, is the movie's only flaw.  Everything else is wonderful.  The acting was great.  Scofield creates a sense of pride, duty, confidence and principle with his character that gives him a high, strong presence whenever he's onscreen.  His character is complex and in a way simple.  Simple: he's refusing to relent not because he believes strongly on the issues of marriage and divorce, but because he believes strongly that no one, not even the king, is above the law.  Complex: his strength and duty begins to become self-destructive when he is jailed, his family is made poor and unhappy and he loses respect from most around him, all the while still refusing to conform.  An Oscar well deserved.The rest of the cast rounds out nicely.  We have Orson Welles in a small role as the gruff Cardinal Wolsey, Leo McKern using scorn as his technique as Cromwell, Hurt playing a sad role that goes from nice and likable to selfish and nasty, and much others.  Ones that stood out for me were Robert Shaw and Wendy Hiller, both Oscar nominated.  Shaw is loud, rude, stupid, and in some way likable as the king, it's not his best performance but it is an entertaining one.  Hiller, playing More's wife, creates a character whose pride and strength diminishes when her husband is punished, revealing what we least expected: love.Also, the film is beautifully shot.  Its scenery is nice, but how the camera captures it is better.  The set direction and costumes are also very impressive, making the film as much a wonder to look at, as it is to watch. And notice how as the movie progresses and More's situation becomes more and more hopeless the tones become muddier; there are more grays and browns than the reds and oranges from early on.The film won the 1966 Academy Award for Best Picture.  I liked `The Sand Pebbles' a little more, but it was still a deserved win in my book.  A great picture, made better by Scofield's powerful performance, 8/10.",

            "content": "Voltaire would probably not have agreed with Thomas Moore's beliefs. But he would have defended Moore's right to have them. For centuries, the Medieval Church had propagated any belief contrary to those disseminated by the Holy See was heresy. People not only faced eternal damnation but could also be tortured and executed for holding contrary religious ideas since the time of Charlegmagne, sometimes even for very slight doctrinal disagreements. Part of these sets of beliefs included unquestioned allegiance to and even worship of the Bishop of Rome, aka the Pope. The film, \"A Man for All Seasons\" is about a man who stood up for the traditional beliefs propagated by the church and his refusal to recant, somewhat in the same vein as Martin Luther but in the opposite direction.In the early 1500's, seven hundred years after Charlemagne used military might to secure the supremacy of the Pope in Western Europe, King Henry VIII of England decided to break with religious and political tradition. Almost over night, the king rebuked the political-religious power of the Pope in Rome and declared himself to be head of the church in England mainly as a mechanism to secure a divorce and re-marry. Fearing the awesome power of the king, all of the nobility and legates which surrounded the royal court signed a declaration not only recognizing the king as head of the church but that God had granted him this power directly from above. Except one did not sign. Sir Thomas Moore.Thomas Moore was the only member of the class of litigators and lawyers who would not sign the document. Openly, he kept silent on his exact opinion. The King decided to regard this act of defiance as treasonous, although Moore never openly admitted his point of view until the trial. He simply refused to sign the document. The case against Moore was certainly on shaky legal grounds as Moore had not actually done anything treasonous. He simply refused to sign and refused to give his reasons.Thomas Moore was a devout Roman Catholic. And although, from a modern perspective, his reasons for refusing to sign the document may seem like blind loyalty to a medieval church and its dogma, Moore's point was that by signing, he would lose all religious integrity and ultimately condemn himself to damnation. His signature meant a recognition of something he did not believe in his heart. He ultimately believed the divorce between Catherine and King Henry was an act of heresy. Simultaneously, he did not deny Henry as head of the English church and Anne Boleyn as the new queen. The document he was asked to sign contained religious wording that placed the powers of local monarchs over that of the church, \"inviolable grants of jurisdictions given by God\". The wording was far too religiously charged for Moore to consent to signing it. It is speculated that if the wording had been altered slightly and words pertaining to God and the Roman Church had been removed, Moore might have signed it. But of course, King Henry, who was as stubborn as Moore, would not revise the document. The film in question is a tour-de-force period piece that well-reflects the religious and monarchical fanaticism of the age. Paul Scofield offers an Acamemy-Award-Winning performance as a man who could not recant even with the threat of the headsman's ax being wielded above his head. Robert Shaw is more than convincing as King Henry VIII who after having broken with Rome could not abide any nobleman or subject to disagree with his position as head of his reformed church. I would not have thought that Shaw would be the ideal actor for this role, but Shaw brings a hot-headed sensibility to Henry that may be relatively historically accurate. Honorable mention goes to John Hurt as Richard Rich, considered by some English historians to be the worst Brit of the 1500's, partly because of the perjury he committed against Moore at his trial, and Wendy Hiller as Alice Moore. Both Shaw and Hiller were nominated for their supporting roles. A great film, not to be missed especially for viewers who enjoy Renaissance and English history.",

            "review_title": "A Film for All Seasons",
            "content": "To celebrate my 800th review for IMDb I turn to another of my favourite films. Fred Zinnemann is one of my favourite directors, for three reasons. Firstly, he made \"High Noon\", my all-time favourite Western. Secondly, he made \"From Here to Eternity\", another great film of the early fifties. Thirdly he made \"A Man for All Seasons\", which must be the greatest ever film about British history. The screenplay was adapted by Robert Bolt from his play of the same name and tells the story of Sir Thomas More, the 16th-century writer, scholar, lawyer, philosopher and theologian who became Lord Chancellor of England and a confidant of Henry VIII. More, however, resigned his office because he disagreed with the King over his divorce from Catherine of Aragon and his break with Rome, disagreements which were to lead to More's execution after conviction on false charges of treason. Today More is regarded as a saint, not only by the Catholic Church but also (remarkably) by the Anglican Church. When I first saw the film as a teenager, I had little knowledge of the historical background, but today I am well aware that the Catholic church had, throughout history, used charges of heresy to silence and persecute those who disagreed with its teachings, often over minor points of doctrine, and that as Lord Chancellor More had played a part in the persecution of Lutherans. (Henry at this time was still regarded as a loyal son of the Church). These matters are not mentioned in the film, and some have seen Bolt as dishonest for praising More's courage while ignoring the sufferings of his equally courageous religious opponents. Does this matter? In my view it does not. Bolt was not a Catholic but an agnostic, and wrote his play not to make propaganda for one religion against another but because he saw More as a man of conscience and integrity who remained true to his principles even under threat of death. The title is borrowed from a description by a contemporary of More, but it also reflects Bolt's view of More as a man for all time. For the film, Bolt abandoned some of the Brechtian devices used in the play, clearly feeling that these would not work in the cinema. In particular, there is no \"Common Man\", the character who acts as the narrator in the play. The film does, however, retain something of the character of a play, with the story presented in a formal, stylised way. Unusually for a film derived from a stage play, it is very visually attractive with memorable scenes, such as that opening boat ride down the Thames against a backdrop of the setting sun. The sets and costumes are very good and combine with Georges Delerue's excellent musical score to give a vivid sense of Tudor life. The main reason why I love this film is the quality of the acting. Zinnemann was an American, and there was an obvious temptation to have More played by a major Hollywood star, such as Charlton Heston who greatly admired Bolt's play and had campaigned to get the role. (Heston was eventually to produce and star in his own version more than twenty years later). Zinnemann, however, resisted this temptation and insisted on using Paul Scofield who had created the role on stage, even though the producers would have preferred a better-known name like Richard Burton or Laurence Olivier. Zinnemann was absolutely right, because Scofield gives a towering performance which rightly won him a Best Actor Oscar, brilliantly demonstrating not only his character's moral integrity but also such other qualities as wisdom, humour, powers of intellect and love for his family. Apart from Orson Welles, all the supporting cast were British. (Although Leo McKern was born in Australia, he spent most of his career in Britain). All were excellent; there is not a single poor performance. Those I would single out for special mention are:-Robert Shaw as King Henry. Shaw plays the King as an outwardly jovial character whose air of bluff good fellowship conceals a hot temper and an intolerance of any opposition to his wishes. This was a much more convincing portrayal of England's most notorious monarch than Eric Bana's in the recent \"The Other Boleyn Girl\". John Hurt as Richard Rich, a young friend of More who treacherously betrays him in the interests of self-advancement. (More has refused to find Rich a position at Court, fearing that he lacks the strength of character to resist the temptations he will find there). This was Hurt's first major role and helped establish him as a promising newcomer. Welles in a brief cameo as Cardinal Wolsey, played as the supreme politician who realises, too late, that realpolitik is not enough. Wendy Hiller as More's loyal wife Alice, who continues to love him and stand beside him, even if she cannot always understand his motivation. McKern as Thomas Cromwell, a cynical, unscrupulous man on the make who acts as the bullying prosecutor at More's trial. Corin Redgrave as More's fiery son-in-law William Roper, who perhaps reflects Redgrave's own personality. (He was a passionately committed Marxist). Redgrave's sister Vanessa appears briefly as Anne Boleyn. Nigel Davenport as the Duke of Norfolk, another friend of More. Unlike Rich, Norfolk is not portrayed as a villain but a basically decent if intellectually undistinguished man who does his best to protect his friend. \u00b7 Besides Scofield's \"Best Picture\", the film also won awards for Best Picture and \"Best Director\" for Zinnemann. Certainly, the Academy have at times honoured some unworthy titles, but this is not one of them. Few films have deserved \"Best Picture\" more. It remains as relevant today as it ever was, a film for all seasons. 10/10",

            "content": "Paul Scofield is Sir Thomas More, \"A Man for All Seasons,\" in a 1966 film directed by Fred Zinnemann and also starring Robert Shaw, Orson Welles, John Hurt, Leo McKern, Wendy Hiller, and Susanna York. Vanessa Redgrave, who was to play York's role, did a play instead and agreed to do the non-speaking role of Anne Boleyn, provided she not be given billing in the ads for the movie.The story concerns Henry VIII's divorce from Catherine, is brother's widow, and his desire to marry Anne Boleyn so that she can give him an heir. Great pressure is put on More, a well-respected lawyer, to support the King, but More will not. He instead chooses to be silent on the matter, even when the King pronounces himself the head of the Church of England. If More speaks out, he will be charged with treason; by keeping silent, the King has no case against him. Nevertheless, a number of people work on More from all angles to get him to sign an oath to the King, but he will not. Finally, the King's cohorts realize that perjury is the only avenue left open to them in order to secure a charge of treason against More and have him executed.Really, there's not much to be said about this profound film about a man who, to the death, had a commitment to his beliefs and never faltered. Paul Scofield is not as famous to vast audiences as Sir Laurence Olivier, Richard Burton, Sir Anthony Hopkins, and a whole host of excellent British actors who have made contributions to film. Scofield has made 30 movies, each chosen by him carefully. If he cared about money, he could gone slumming as a few of his counterparts did; with his magnificent voice and imposing presence, he could have done a Grey Poupon or a Polaroid commercial. But as a true artist and not an actor looking for production money, money to support a theater, or, like Burton, unable to recover from an impoverished childhood, his film work is not geared toward superstardom or prolific work. In every role he plays, from the obsessed Nazi in \"The Train,\" to van Doren Sr. in \"Quiz Show,\" he is magnificent.But Sir Thomas More is his greatest role. It was turned down by Richard Burton, who would have been excellent but perhaps given us a more showy performance. Scofield's Sir Thomas More is a man humble before God, his true leader. He believes that no man is above the law, and that no man is above God. He is an unusual person in this world - he stands up for what he believes in no matter the cost. We seem to love these characters in films and books - More, Atticus Finch, Terry Malloy, and yet in the world outside of film, there are fewer and fewer exhibitions of such character.The rest of the cast is uniformly great, including Orson Welles as Cardinal Wolsey; Leo McKern, so beloved as Rumpole of the Bailey, is here the horrid Thomas Cromwell, who will stop at nothing to make More bend his way; John Hurt as the slimy Richard Rich; Wendy Hiller as More's suffering wife; and Susannah York as his beloved daughter Margaret.It's sometimes forgotten that Henry VIII was once a young, athletic, and very attractive man - I was reminded of it just last summer when I saw an absolute hunk play the young Henry. The arrogant, flirtatious, handsome man playing Henry in \"A Man for All Seasons\" looked familiar, but I couldn't place him. Having only seen the Robert Shaw of \"The Sting\" and \"Jaws,\" it was hard to believe that he had ever looked or sounded the way he did in this film. He gives a marvelous, fiery performance.The cinematography and scenery in this film is stunning, and there are many outside scenes - the sunlight in Thomas More's eyes as the King comes into view, the hustle and bustle of the town, the darkness of More's cell juxtaposed with the bright outdoors - all important parts of the story.The last half hour is hard to take for the viewer, but it is some of the most beautiful work ever in film. More's final moments are magnificent and to be treasured.A must-see for the story of a great man, and for one of the top performances of all time.",

The film follows the true-life story of Saint Thomas More, a English noble man who stood up to the King when the King attempted to throw down the Catholic Church for a divorce. English actor Paul Scofield portrays the noble rebel and his opponent is none other then Robert Shaw as King Henry VIII. As the film begins we meet Thomas and his family. We see him as a kind, God loving man, highly respected among the people of England and its king. Soon the problem of the king not having a heir is brought about and the king seeks to divorce, Highly against Church law, the bishops of England stand against it as does Thomas. Soon Thomas is stripped of everything and thrown into the Tower of London. Form the first scene of this film to the last word of Thomas you are virtually stunned by this man. The film is able to portray his brilliance in staying alive in the tower, his love of God, and his opposition to the King bending Church laws so he can have what he wants.Paul Scofield is absolutely brilliant as St. Thomas More. He is able to portray a man in a constantly struggle between his service to God and his service to his country. He out acts everyone in the film and in the final scene in the court you want to stand up and applaud him. Robert Shaw is also acts his heart out in the role of the King. He is able to capture the insanity that actually was in the real King and also is a good villain for the film. Shaw, along with Scofield, make the film what it is. They are simply amazing and bring out their characters true nature.The film conveys a powerful message of not bending to something you don't believe even if it means punishment. in St. Thomas More's case, the punishment was hatred from the country. This is one of the best films I've seen this year. A Man for All Seasons. Starring: Paul Scofield, Robert Shaw, Wendy Hiller, and Leo McKern.5 out of 5 Stars.",

While Heston's performance isn't bad (just like the remake), it lacks the nuance and subtlety of Scofield's.Also featuring Robert Shaw as Henry VIII, Leo McKern as Cromwell, Nigel Davenport as the Duke of Norfolk, a young John Hurt (in his first major role) as a social climber and a memorable cameo by Orson Welles as bitter, bleary-eyed Cardinal Wolsey.8/10",

The story is never less than compelling, Fred Zinnerman's direction is impeccable and the dialogue is moving and intelligent.And of course, how can I not write this review without mentioning the cast? Robert Shaw is a different Henry VIII, younger, thinner and is quite intelligent with a lot of political skill. Orson Welles is a fine Cardinal Wolsey and John Hurt in his first major role is suitably eloquent, while Leo McKern, Susannah York and Vanessa Redgrave play their roles with aplomb. Easily though, the best performance comes from Paul Scofield, who is simply brilliant as Sir Thomas Moore, with a balance of virtue and vanity.All in all, a splendid film, elevated by Scofield and the rest of the cast. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The acting, direction, and design of this movie are uniformly excellent.  The segue into Henry VIII's entrance is alone reason for seeing the movie.  The production design is top-notch, both beautiful and--unlike many \"costume dramas\"--not so overwhelming as to lose the actors among outrageous sets and costumes. For an adaptation of a stage play, a remarkable proportion of the action taking place outdoors, with More's house at Chelsea being particularly lovely.\nIt's very easy to see this film superficially as a moral fable, and many people scoff at it as being a stagy morality play.  But it's both more subtle and more vibrant that that.  The subtlety of Robert Bolt's script lies in its exploration of identity.  We're not meant to identify or admire More's religious ideas, which the movie actually tiptoes around.  Instead it's what Bolt called More's \"adamantine sense of his own self\" that the movie really highlights.",

ROBERT SHAW gives an over-the-top, typically flamboyant performance as Henry VIII that sometimes borders on the ludicrous. Yet, for this performance, he received much acclaim.But PAUL SCOFIELD carries the film with his intelligent, piercing eyes and wit as he spars verbally with every member of his household, including WENDY HILLER as his stubborn wife who wants him to spare himself the indignity of being sent to the Tower. He maintains his poise and quiet determination at all times.The costumes, the sets, the exteriors--all are brilliantly captured to give the film an authentic feeling of time and atmosphere. The screenplay by Robert Bolt is a pleasure to watch and listen to as it unfolds a period of history right before our eyes.

And, while in the film Thomas More retired to a quiet life and said nothing negative about his king, this wasn't exactly what More did.However, these are just minor quibbles--the film itself is simply marvelous. Paul Scofield did a fantastic job as More and justifiably received the Oscar for this performance. The movie is very moving and interesting and gives a wonderful insight into the sort of slimy toad that Henry VIII really was. And, all this is done with great reverence to the costumes and manners of the period.

            "content": "Although the ancient world epic died its death during the 1960s, period pictures were still popular and prevalent. In particular, this era saw a little fad of features set in medieval England. They differed from their more ostentatious forebears not just in setting, but in a realistic and intimate approach that went with the new generation of filmmaking. A Man for All Seasons represents the subgenre at its peak.A Man for All Seasons is derived from a play by Robert Bolt, a name most familiar from the screenplays for David Lean's epics. It stands as one of his best works. He has these brilliantly succinct and engaging ways of introducing characters. When we first meet Thomas More, he has that exchange with his servant Matthew where he implies his knowledge that Matthew has sneaked a peak at the letter. It shows More's intelligence, but also his maturity, and in a way that also endears him to us. Similarly, the little moment when the king first appears, and he jumps in the mud, there is an awkward silence as his lackeys are unsure how to react, then they all laugh when the king laughs. It tells us everything we need to know about the king's character, and by extension the state of politics in the country at the time. All the way through characters are fully rounded and familiar, yet never clich\u00e9d. One of Bolt's biggest weaknesses in the Lean screenplays was an inability to write strong female characters The part of Alice More is an exception to this.The director is Fred Zinnemann. Zinnemann has, not exactly a documentary style as some have stated, but certainly a penchant for naturalism, frequently staging little acts that make logical sense without ever delving into the banality of protracted realism. For example, in the opening scene we see Leo McKern giving the paper a little shake to dry the ink \u2013 you wouldn't see anything so everyday in a 50s historical picture. A few shots later, and we see the messenger momentarily lose his balance as he leaps out of the boat. This aspect of normality, when coupled with the impressively authentic sets and costumes, seems to bring us incredibly close to the era depicted. Zinnemann's camera is wonderfully calm and meditative, with Spartan shot compositions that show us only what we need at any given moment. Every reaction shot has some meaning, and I'm not just talking about the close-ups. Sometimes they are further back (yet still noticeable) for a more subtle touch. I'm thinking for example of John Hurt's reaction when he hears that the cup he sold for fifty shillings was worth a hundred. Zinnemann's montages of carvings and monuments give context to the scenes that precede them without being too contrived in their symbolism. The shot of fluttering leaves and the sound of bird song that open the final scene create a really beautiful moment, a hint of undaunted nature carrying on regardless.And then of course there is the magnificent cast making all this work. Paul Schofield gives a nicely subdued performance, showing us not only More's calm demeanour but also a man smothering his true thoughts, smothering even his emotions, allowing them to break through to the surface just a little in the last few scenes, and even then doing so with breathtaking control. Wendy Hiller is similarly understated, yet always hinting at the potential fieriness of Alice's personality. When her character does give full vent to her feelings, Hiller does so with such power and such precision. Even in the smaller roles, the quality of someone like Colin Blakely (Matthew) is enough to make memorable his \"I wish we had wings\" outburst. The only performance I dislike is Robert Shaw's as the king, which is conspicuously theatrical. Presumably this was intentional, paralleling as it does portrayals of Nero and the like, but it's out of step with the realism of everything else. It's a pity it resulted in Shaw's only Oscar nomination because he did much better stuff that was not so recognized.The only other problem with A Man for All Seasons is that, for all the bravery and principle with which it is carried out, Thomas More's silence regards what boils down to little more than technicalities; a mere detail of religious bureaucracy. What's more both the political and even the religious arguments against it seem fairly sensible. To my mind it somewhat blunts the presentation of More as a man of logic and shrewdness. Still, I guess the fact that A Man for all Seasons is still a forceful and affecting motion picture despite the relative triviality of More's struggle is a testament to the quality of its writing, direction and acting. Purely as a piece of filmmaking, this comes pretty damn close to perfect.",

I have the original and he has topped and tailed it for clarity and perhaps brevity, but nothing of value has been lost. Every line is worth hearing, and most of them are gems.But a near-perfect script could be wasted upon inept or unsuitable players. Happily, that doesn't happen here. This movie contains some of the cream of British acting. And towering above them all is Paul Schofeild. I have seen him miscast and wasted in other works, but he was surely born to play Sir Thomas More - 'the most moral man in England'.It is a beautiful and lavish production that is both a time capsule of English history and British acting at its best. With modern actors constantly striving for Hollywood stardom and appealing to some kind of mid-Atlantic, cross-cultural ideal, it is unlikely than anything so quintessentially representative of English culture will ever be made again. I was told that even the theme music was played on authentic instruments of the period.There have been other productions, but they pale by comparison. Apparently Charlton Heston lobbied to get his hands on the part. Can you imagine? Now there is surely an elephant that thought it could fly. I have observed more gravitas staring out at me from my aquarium. Indeed, he did feature in a TV production, and I winced with embarrassment at his hammy Hollywood excess.

            "content": "Adapted from Robert Bolt's prize-winning play, \"A Man for All Seasons\" is the historical chronicle of an announced martyrdom: Sir Thomas More, the Lord Chancellor of England in the 16th century, the man who stood up against the cancellation of King Henry VIII's first marriage, and refused to take the oath that recognized him the Supreme Head of the Church of England. \"A Man for All Seasons\" is not 'one of these' big-budgeted costume-dramas typical of the declining sixties. In 1966, it was the 5th highest grossing film, it 'stole' several Oscars to the more popular \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\", including Best Picture and Best Actor, and is regarded by the British Film Institute as the 43rd best British film. The film is directed by Fred Zinnermann, who'd already made the Best Picture winner \"From Here to Eternity\" and \"High Noon\", another gripping story of a man finding the courage to stand alone against adversity. It features magnificent performances from Paul Scofield, embodying the moral strength of Thomas More with a subtle, quiet yet undeniable aura, and Robert Shaw literally inflamed the screen with the living paradox of Henry VIII's intimidating charisma and threatening joviality.But beyond all these cinematic qualities, it's for its inspirational lesson of integrity that I will never admire it enough. Since the dawn of ages, it's always been more profitable to cheat, and to betray in order to gain in wealth and power while the soul of humanity relies on justice, goodness and fairness, and Thomas More, more than anyone embodies these virtues. A jurist and lawyer, none of his enemies denies his honesty. But fate also placed him as King Henry VIII's servant. Henry married his brother's widow after having obtained the Pope's dispensation but incapable to have a son from his wife Catherine, he needed to divorce before marrying his mistress, the fertile Anne Boleyn. The film opens with Cardinal Wolsey (Orson Welles) pleading Thomas to help him to pressure the Church. Invocating its independence, More refuses, as he'd say later: he might be the King's servant, but he's God's first.More can't betray his private conscience, if he wants to lives up with himself the rest of his life, it's not even a dilemma, it's certitude. In an ironic turn of events, Wolsey's dying words are: \"if I had served God half as good as I served the King, He (God) wouldn't have let me die in this place\". Wolsey's miserable ending shows that even compromising one's beliefs to obey an illegitimate authority can be sometimes unrewarding. But More, if not a cleric, is a true man of religion, he believes in the soul's salvation of the and can't compromise it by denying himself, not that the King's authority is illegitimate, but if it tries to surpass the Papacy, it is. The Magna Carta guarantees the Church's independence and so does the Coronation's oath, More doesn't have his faith but Law too in his side. But he's too naive to really believe that these considerations would matter.The first encounter with the King strikes by its cheerful friendliness; Henry is in a jovial mood, happy to meet the new Chancellor of England. Robert Shaw steals the show as the charismatic figure, good-natured yet unpredictable, when he accidentally put his feet on mud, he lets an awkward moment of silence go, suspending the courtship to his reaction, before bursting out laughing. The on-going conversation between the King and More leaves no doubt about their mutual respect, but it's even more certain that Henry would not tolerate any opposition. More seals his own fate when even to the King, he's incapable to lie to himself, he even calls Catherine the Queen, provoking Henry's uncontrollable furor before he quietly storms off and decides to go back to he barge, abruptly shortening his visit. It will be one of the several occasions given to More to bend to the King's marriage, in vain.Ironically, it's because everyone admires his integrity and honesty, that his allegiance is required. More can't even afford to remain silent, and as he does, arguing that Law can only base its judgment on facts, and none of his facts ever proved a treason, he's the object of a plot driven by Thomas Cromwell (Leo McKern) and his new prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Richard Rich. The 26-year old John Hurt is remarkably despicable as the ambitious go-getter who'd do anything to have power, or at least the allure of it. He embodies men's natural tendency to moral corruption. He'll inspire one of the film's greatest quotes when he condemns More by perjury. Learning that he's been appointed Attorney General of Wales, More stoically replies, \"it profits a man nothing to sell his soul for the whole word. But for Wales\"\"A Man for All Seasons\" strikes by an intelligent screenplay inviting us to question the value of More's sacrifice, sacrificing privileges, titles, freedom, Family and ultimately life, life for such abstractions as beliefs or faiths. When you think about it, it's only in the moments where they're undermined that these abstractions have a value. It's seen as abstractions as long as actions don't speak for them but Thomas More is a man who acts according to his word. When Rich asks him for an employment, he quietly but ruthlessly say \"no\", he knows men's value enough, and judge them according to their capability to answer for themselves. Ironically, out of all those who plotted, Rich is the only one to die peacefully in his bed, after having been Chancellor of England himself.The film concludes with this irony as a reminder that power doesn't necessarily belong to the most deserving, and that we all ultimately die but it's all about the marks we leave. And what Thomas More left is a universal example of courage and integrity, regardless of the faith that inspired him.",

            "content": "A Man for all Seasons is a 1966 film directed by Fred Zinneman. It tells the story of the final years of Sir Thomas More. Like Elizabeth, the film was praised and won an impressive six Oscars. It was an adaptation of a play written by Robert Bolt and this is important to note, unlike certain adaptations that would come years later. A Man for all Seasons sticks much, much, closer to the actual history. In fact, only very minor details were changed as opposed to the almost fantasy-like take on Queen Elizabeth. While both are great films, A Man for all Seasons has a little more of my respect because of this. Now to the movie's story.The film centers on Sir Thomas More, played excellently by Paul Scofield, who refuses to submit in the face of ever increasing pressure. More is portrayed as a man who adhered to his religion no matter the consequence. Interestingly enough, the DVD I purchased had the tagline \"His silence was more powerful than words\". At first, I had not a clue what that meant. After watching the film, I see now that the meaning behind it is really rather tragic. In the face of threats and endless persecution from his peers and King Henry VIII himself, More refused to crucify himself by openly declaring his reasoning. It was a clever way of going about it, but also sad in that a man had to resort to such tactics in the first place.Of course , in the end it is not enough to save the main character from the king's wrath. Unfortunately, he goes the way of the martyr. In so doing, however, he became an impeccable symbol of virtue and strength. By refusing to allow politics to mold his beliefs, Sir Thomas More became a testament to integrity. The movie's theme is wrapped up cleverly inn its very title. Sir Thomas More truly was a Man for all Seasons.",

            "content": "Fred Zinnemann's \"A Man For All Seasons\" tells the tale of Sir Thomas More, an English Chancellor who was persecuted and eventually executed for treason. A staunch Roman Catholic, More found himself caught in a moral quandary: should he publicly support King Henry VII's reformation and marriage to Anne Boleyn, or trumpet pre-reformation laws, which he believed no earthly man had the right to change? More stuck by his faith, of course, and was decapitated months later.The film captures well the drumbeat of modern politics, Zinneman conveying the corruption, legal wranglings and cloak and dagger manoeuvrings seemingly inherent to state affairs. And like he does in his 1959 film, \"The Nun's Story\", in which Audrey Hepburn plays a nun caught between conscience and confrontation, Zinnemann paints More as a man torn between private ethics and public duty, which the film curses for not being one and the same. \"A Man For All Seasons\" was released at the height of the Vietnam war, and gave embittered audiences something they increasingly didn't believe in: politicians with real honour, morals and character. But though Zinneman captures several truths \u2013 that our entire political system is conductive of corruption, that seemingly everyone sells their souls for power, position, title and silver, that disengagement is increasingly, paradoxically, both the only moral choice and a profound betrayal of one's beliefs \u2013 his portrait of More is nevertheless far too idealistic. Everyone in Zinnemann's film is severely flawed in some way, except for the noble, loving, honest More. Of course in actuality, More's \"moral stance\" is no admirable stance at all; he was merely preoccupied with a hard-nosed, absolutist, ultra-conservative reading of the Bible and irrationally believed God to be on his side. It is easy to sacrifice your life when you've been conditioned to think you shall be rewarded in death. And of course the very reformation More opposed was a somewhat positive thing, as it was from this moment onwards that divorce, marital affairs and a bevy of other things began to slip away from Rome and the ecclesiastical courts.So the film simplifies what should be far murkier. It presents a false choice \u2013 God, goodness and a good man vs mortals, politics and evil men - and then lets you pat yourself on the back for knowing that you too would never sacrifice your ideals. But it's never that clear cut. Historically, both \"sides\" of this film were equally repressive, and the King's Protestanism was politically, not religiously motivated. Meanwhile, all of the historical More's perversions, fanaticisms and cruelties have been completely washed away by Zinnemann (as an Inquisitor he was responsible for many murders). End result, a false binary made legitimate by fantasy.The film is nevertheless impeccably acted. Phillip Scofield plays More as a man of wit, intellect and unflappable cool and the always watchable Orson Welles has a bit part as a the corpulent Cardinal Wolsey. Based on a stage-play by Robert Bolt, the film's dialogue is both beautifully written and marvellously spoken. Lines dart back and forth like daggers, and much of the film simply consists of wonderful word-smiths wielding words like weapons. Ironically, \"A Man For All Seasons\" is a film in which almost everything said is about More's refusal to speak. His silence, his refusal to swear allegiance to the King, is the film's loudest cry.Aesthetically Zinnemann adopts a simple, sedate tone. His camera rarely moves, and the film unfolds very much like a stage-play. To overcome this theatricality Zinnemann inserts a loud, bombastic score, pumps his dialogue full of glucose and removes all dead air from the film (shades of Hawks and Mamet). His tale sledgehammers you so hard that you don't quite notice how idiotic and insidious it all is.7.9/10 \u2013 See \"12 Angry Men\", \"Becket\" (1964) and \"The Lion In Winter\" (1968).",

In the 1966 version, \" A Man For All Seasons,\" it is Paul Scofield who portrays Sir Thomas More as no other has before or since. With such powerful conviction, emphasis and stately elegance, one comes to believe the role was custom made for him. The film is drawn from the English archives and the classic confrontation between King Henry VIII and Thomas More the scholar and chancellor of England. King Henrys' wife is unable to produce a son and heir for him, forcing the King to play Queen roulette, hoping one will give him what he seeks. The problem is the Roman Catholic Church forbids the King to select a wife for convenience alone. Fearing the King's wrath, everyone acknowledges and complies to his wishes and his demands, all except More and therein lies the dispute. In this version, the viewer is treated to a hosts of exceptional actors and actresses, among which are Leo McKern, Robert Shaw as King Henry VIII, Orson Welles, Susannah York, Nigel Davenport and John Hurt, who is superb as Richard Rich. While watching the film, one is drawn into the historical battle which imparts the legacy of perhaps the most legendary man of any season. Well Done. ****",

Henry wants to marry his mistress Anne Bolyn, but Moore, with stubborn (and ultimately fatal) integrity, refuses to sanction the King's divorce from Catherine of Aragon, leaving himself at the mercy of influential and unscrupulous men (chief among them the King's cynical, lickspittle henchman Cromwell) anxious to see Henry's wishes granted at any cost. The language employed in Bolt's play is often more rich and stately than royalty itself, but not enough to hide the treachery and corruption lurking just beneath the panoply of courtly manners. Here, for once, is a convincing period piece with all the intrigue but none of the fluff of a Hollywood historical drama, played to the hilt by an exceptional cast of actors, who leave director Fred Zinnemann with little to do except make sure the costumes were straight and the scenery in focus.",

The film is directed by the late great Fred Zinnemann, who has helmed such diverse classics as From here to Eternity and Day of the Jackal, brings a sense of immediacy to the screen, and thereby transcends some of the screenplays stage like origins.Paul Scofield plays the title role of Sir Thomas More. His dilemma being that he's forced against his will to acknowledge King Henry VIII divorce. The film's action therefore is confounded to a battle of wits between Sir Thomas Moore and his opponents at the Kings court.That might not sound like much in terms of excitement in the classical sense, but this is offset by the brilliant acting of the entire cast and especially Paul Scofield, who received an Academy Award for his outstanding work, as Sir Thomas Moore and his main nemesis Thomas Cromwell, played by Leo McKern, exchange arguments and counterarguments in a bid for victory, where only one of them may come out the winner.The sumptuous productions values must also be noted as they play a crucial part in the film's overall success. Both the cinematography and the music is some the best I've seen in a period-piece such as this one.  As I've just said, a truly fantastic achievement by all involved parties.

It stars Paul Scofield, Wendy Hiller, Leo McKern, Robert Shaw, Orson Welles, Susannah York, Nigel Davenport and John Hurt. Music is by Georges Delerue and cinematography by Ted Moore. Plot has Scofield as Sir Thomas More, the man who refused to cede to the mighty machinations of King Henry VIII (Shaw).It's very much an actors movie, beautifully literate and costumed and photographed up to the nines. So not one for those more keen on the action orientated historical epic, then! The story is thriving on the anguish of Thomas More, who is torn between loyalty to his King and his own moral beliefs, the beliefs of his religion system and the potential damning of his soul. The political and religious machinations positively pulse throughout, vividly brought to life by a cast of great thespians (Scofield is as great as you have heard).Great credit has to go to Zinneman, one of the deserved recipients of the 6 Oscars the film garnered. He never lets the cast run away with things, no chewing the scenery or smell the fart acting, he keeps them in check and they respond by providing an utterly fascinating and compelling historical saga. But most of all, with all the royal pomp on show, it's the intelligence of the writing that shines brightest. The dialogue via the sharp script throws cloaks of suspicion over everything being played out. Religion and politics, huh, it's for the birds. Top film making. 8/10",

Any individual viewer will have his own expectations about what a movie should be, and they will never mesh perfectly with what is actually on screen.This being said, \"A Man for All Seasons\" is the closest thing I have ever seen to a \"perfect\" movie. The dialogue is witty, deep, believable, informative, layered, and meaningful. The plot is superb, and the subject is an excellent one. Any historical film will have inaccuracies, to be sure, and this one does, but Robert Bolt managed to minimize them by using the actual words of many of the historical figures depicted.The plot is both very complex and very simple, providing philosophical depth to fill hours of discussion, but still intuitive enough that anyone can understand the basics.The acting is magnificent. Paul Scofield's depiction of a moderate, reserved, unassuming man of great character bring to mind Plato's conception of a perfect Philosopher, just as Robert Shaw's portrayal of Henry VIII as an intemperate, vain, arrogant man with drastic mood swings is a great representation of Plato's Tyrant. Indeed, all the characters in this film seem to represent elements of the struggle between these opposing types.The other thing that fascinates me about \"A Man for All Seasons\" is the way it manages to be completely riveting without any \"action\" scenes.

            "content": "My favorite quote from this film is the following exchange between Sir Thomas More, Lord Chancellor of England (the rough equivalent of today's Attorney General in the US) and his son-in-law to be Will Roper. ROPER: So, now you give the Devil the benefit of law! MORE: Yes! What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? ROPER: Yes, I'd cut down every law in England to do that! MORE: Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned 'round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to coast, Man's laws, not God's! And if you cut them down, and you're just the man to do it, do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake! This has been quoted widely in the blogosphere to describe the behavior of the current administration and the war on terror. Would the zealots among us cut down every law in the US to get at terror? I fear the counsel we would be given by this administration would be rather different from Sir Thomas' advice to his daughter's suitor. But more instructive advice comes to us from one of its villains, Cromwell. \"We are just the administrators,\" Cromwell tells Richard Rich, who is meeting with him secretly, desperately seeking a job. Cromwell enthralls young Rich, telling him that if the King wants to divorce his woman and marry another, it is up to the administrators to make it happen. Slowly, inevitably, Cromwell seduces Rich to betray Sir Thomas More, from whom Rich once received a gift. No matter what the King wants, Cromwell will make it legal. This sounds too familiar. Who could it remind us of today? No wonder people yearn for the quiet moral rectitude of Sir Thomas More. Rich is played by a young, handsome John Hurt; Cromwell by the durable actor who played \"The Common Man\" in the play, Leo McKern. Scofield, as More, brings admirable restraint to More's uncompromising loyalty to his principles of faith. The contrast to today's champions of people of faith is most instructive. It is about Rich, who More knows is about to betray him that More has the following dialog with Roper. MORE: There's no law against that. ROPER: There is! There's God's law. MORE: Then let God arrest him. More was incorruptible. He would not invoke God's law over the human-made law he had sworn to uphold as Lord Chancellor, even to save his own neck.Rich goes on to betray More by misleading the court at More's trial for treason, a charge brought by Cromwell because More would not bless the King's marriage to Anne Boleyn. Like someone we know who went to Africa and came back with the wrong intelligence, More has to be gotten out of the way, discredited, or killed. Rich is just the man for the job. And his reward, he is made chief solicitor of Wales, a job for which he is too young, and clearly not yet qualified.When this film was released in 1966, the intelligence being cooked so the President could have his way was about Vietnam. Today, you know the story.More was eventually elevated to Sainthood. He is the patron saint of lawyers and politicians. The certainly seem to need a patron saint.",

            "content": "Except for Henry II and his family, and Richard III, the first monarch to really get center stage (in terms of chronological history) in motion pictures is Henry VIII. He has been in or near the center of at least seven or eight pictures (including at least one biography). So far (this list is far from complete) he appears in: \"The Private Life of Henry VIII\" (Charles Laughton - and his Oscar.); \"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\" (Both television series and film starring Keith Mitchell\".); \"A Man For All Seasons\" (Robert Shaw as the monarch.);\"Anne of a Thousand Days (Richard Burton as the monarch.); \"The Prince and the Pauper\" (1936 version with Montague Love as the monarch.); \"Crossed Swords\" (The latest of the remakes of \"The Prince and the Pauper\" with Charleton Heston as the monarch.); \"Young Bess\" (Actually Jean Simmons as Elizabeth is star, but daddy is played by Laughton again.)His was a very involved and complex reign, with the development of the navy (Henry's hobby) and the English Reformation (Henry's sexual desires and his anger) at the center of much historic churning. He comes across as a man of great ability and self-absorption - nothing would stand in his way to achieving an end that was for his pleasure. It is easy why so many (including Jane Austen and Charles Dickens) came away seeing the monster. The monster was there, but it was a monster with a mind. Whether that was good or bad I will not take a stand on. For all the good in Henry's naval policies, his willingness to take life is not easy to swallow. Especially when his victims include Bishop Fisher and Thomas More, two of the best men of that generation.Although he appears in \"Anne of a Thousand Days\", John Fisher is not the subject of any film. Pity, for (although he did not write a great political fantasy like More) he actually tried to live by Christian precepts (something his more worldly colleague Wolsey never thought about until he was on the verge of trial and execution). Unlike More, who was circumspect (\"A Man For All Seasons\" shows how he was an exceptionally clever lawyer for so long), Fisher was outspoken in his opposition to Henry's divorce. That was why he got executed first. More is the subject of this film based on John Osborne's brilliant play of the same name. Like Wolsey he did not come from a noble family but worked his way up by his brilliance. He did demonstrate honesty (a rare quality in that period...in public servants in particular). However Osborne does hint that his rise to the Lord Chancellorship was more due to the political scheming of Wolsey (his predecessor) and Henry himself. Both apparently felt that they could either impress or awe More into being a loyal subordinate, or could threaten him, or bribe him. Since he felt he was loyal to God he did not need their stroking or their clawing. He was a grown man and knew that today's favorite of fortune could be on Tower Hill tomorrow (as Wolsey almost was, and as the Duke of Norfolk (Nigel Davenport) almost was). And as Henry's cousin the Duke of Buckingham (briefly heir apparent) definitely was in 1522. So More was aware of the threat, but also aware that for men such threats are eventually meaningless. More did not speak out against Henry's divorce and marriage to Anne Boleyn until backed into an impossible corner. He made his conviction for treason impossible until a rogue (Richard Rich - John Hurt) perjures himself. When that dooms him, then and only then does he admit he is in the Fisher camp - that the divorce is a sin against God.Of course, today, we might be more willing to accept Henry's divorce of Catherine of Aragon because divorce is more acceptable...or is it? Witness the current mixed feelings about the coming morganatic marriage of the Prince of Wales to Ms Parker-Bowles, which fans of the late Princess Diane are upset about. Charles problems are compounded by the fact that he will be head of the Anglican Church, and as such his wife is supposed to be only his wife. Camilla is a divorc\u00e9e (whose ex-husband is still alive). This situation is due to Henry's antics in 1530-33 when he \"overthrew\" the Roman Catholic Church in England and set up the Anglican Church with himself as head, gave himself special dispensation to divorce Catherine (on spurious moral grounds), declared his daughter Mary a bastard, and married Anne. It was to allow the King to have a male heir (he had an illegitimate male heir, the Earl of Richmond, but wanted a legitimate one). More, Fisher, one can add the worried Wolsey, knew it was for this reason, but the King had the muscle to make his camp supreme. And when the monasteries were seized, the lands to bribe his camp followers.As his two (or three) critics guessed it would not work. Anne produced a brilliant heir, but it was a girl named Elizabeth. Disappointed and angry, Henry lashed back and within a year of killing England's greatest lawyer and humanist (of that time) had Anne executed as well (and Elizabeth branded a bastard now). The third wife, Jane Seymour, would live long enough to bear one son, the sickly Edward VI (who would have a seven year reign). Three others would follow Jane, including another who went to the block. So did other political figures (including Cromwell, so deviously played by Leo McKern here). In the end Henry made England one of the big three Western European states, but he was a paranoid old man when he died (of syphilis, as the film says). Posterity respects his achievements, but cringes at his excesses of cruelty. They also still adorn More and Fisher, the men who had guts to say no.",

I had a cursory insight into the events surrounding More's stoic judgment and eventual demise way back in my high school days some half century ago, but to see the machinations that led to his execution is something else again. More made the decision, some would call it a mistake, to forego 'minimizing the inconvenience of things', and instead remained resolute in opposing the marriage of King Henry VIII (Robert Shaw) to Anne Boleyn (Vaness Redgrave) upon securing a divorce from Lady Catherine. I wouldn't know what parts of this story might be called into question for historical accuracy, but as an overview of the circumstances surrounding Henry VIII, More, and functionaries like Cromwell (Leo McKern) and the Duke of Norfolk (Nigel Davenport) all seem to bear credibility. As a period drama and cinematic achievement, there aren't many finer films, and the only exception I would take with the production is something the movie actually earned an Oscar for, that of Best Costume Design for a Color Movie. Yes, it did have that, but if you take a discerning look at the clothing of players like King Henry III and the guests at his wedding celebration, all of it looked like it was brand new and made specifically for the picture and not part of a Sixteenth Century, every day wardrobe.

It portrays the life and death of Sir Thomas More, a prominent member of the court of English King Henry VIII. Grounded in historical fact, this movie vividly tells the story of More's stand against the king's betrayal of the law of God. When the Catholic King Henry VIII sought to divorce his wife, Catherine of Aragon, so he could instead marry Anne Boleyn, his will was opposed by the Roman papacy as being repugnant to the clear teachings of scripture. Rather than submit, Henry chose to rebel by having Parliament pass a law to establish the Church of England and declare Henry the head of it. In order to legitimise his claim to this new title, however, Henry needed the support of his members of state, not the least of which was Thomas More.In a brilliant performance, Paul Scofield depicts Thomas in his steadfast assertion of integrity and conscience toward the law of God. His chief accusers are repeatedly confounded at Thomas' evasion of their clever snares and manipulations, designed at first to gain More's cooperation but later to get him to incriminate himself.Films such as this are rare today; 'A Man for All Seasons' turns not on action sequences, battles past or present or on a love affair. It is neither a comedy nor a tragedy in the classic sense. In a word, it would seem to have little to recommend it - however, it is one of the best film ever produced. The director Fred Zimmermann resisted the urge to provide orchestral music as a background to many of the scenes; indeed, through much of the film, there is no music at all, as the drama itself carries the weight of the narrative and atmosphere. The cinematographer, Ted Moore, as well as the director received Academy Awards for their work.This is an actor's film, the force of the drama being driven by their performances. Exceptional acting by John Hurt, Leo McKern, Nigel Davenport and Robert Shaw enhance lead actor Paul Scofield's Oscar-winning portrayal. Robert Shaw's Henry VIII presents the mood swings and apparent callousness toward human values reflecting the common judgement of his reign in traditional history. Shaw displays a fine villain, but can touch only lightly the complexity of Henry's position in Reformation England. Bolt's screenplay denies Shaw the scope he might have used in depicting Henry's burdens.Hurt and McKern portray Richard Rich and Thomas Cromwell, schemers and social climbers of which royal courts were always full. The roles of More's wife Alice (Wendy Hiller) and daughter Meg (Susannah York) are admirably played. Alice as the illiterate yet intelligent wife of More is concerned for the family's well-being; Meg as the educated daughter (More's experimental school practised, generations ahead of its time, gender equality in education) almost steals the scene from Shaw at one point.The message is unmistakable - that in an age of moral and ethical relativism, sometimes one must gamble all, even one's life, to cling to integrity - and ultimately one's own soul. This parable is sorely needed in our own day.",

We see so much compromise of conviction and values in movies today. gray becomes white and then black and evil becomes good in the same way.

As a movie depicting what really happened in history, I can not determine, but allowing the writer and the director as much artistic license as is taken by others, then this movie is a great account of a man who remained faithful to his faith and conscience.\"When I go to hell for not doing my conscience...\" a question posed by Sir Thomas Moore.",

From the dramatic musical score that opened the story, and red tip of boat's white oar dipping into the water, to the first sight of Paul Scofield's earnest, troubled countenance I would be mesmerized for the following two hours. When I entered the theater (the film had already been a mega-hit in London) I didn't know what to expect, but the theater's reserved seat policy indicated it would be a very special movie.And it was. Indeed, seeing 'A Man for All Seasons' was an extraordinary experience for me. When I walked out of the theater I felt a change in my consciousness; Paul Scofield's performance was so brilliant he appeared to transcend acting, i.e., watching him play Saint Thomas More (or, Sir Thomas,if you prefer)was somehow like seeing More himself and his whole world get get caught up in a time-warp and play out their fates on the screen four centuries after their time on the planet.Wordsworth said that all of literature tries to answer the same question: \"How should a man live?\" When I left that theater in Australia almost four decades ago, that movie, 'A Man for All Seasons,' made such an impression on my thinking I learned how to TRY to live, and I've tried to carry on as such ever since: as close to the values espoused by Thomas More as possible.",

With vivid color, sweeping scenes, well-constructed sets, elegant costumes and a score that befits the era, this film is certainly an excellent example of a period film.Paul Scofield is perfect as Sir Thomas; a thoughtful man of conviction who, as a former lawyer, can rationalize his way out of verbal traps with pristine dialogue. Robert Shaw was an apt choice to play the bombastic King Henry VIII, and makes a strong impression despite having a relatively brief role. Orson Welles likewise makes a strong impression with an even briefer role as Cardinal Woolsey. Leo McKern also deserves note as the conniving Thomas Cromwell and John Hurt is excellent in an earlier role as the brash Richard Rich.The story is deliberately paced, but never boring. The characterization of Sir Thomas is well-developed and the film's dialogue is clever from all quarters. More's determination and the malicious methods of his opponents to break it make for a touching story.",

            "content": "Considering my only entry point into the history of England during the reign of King Henry VIII comes from the first season of Showtime's \"The Tudors,\" (a quality program, perhaps a tad too salacious than absolutely necessary), I was more than obliged to take a friend up on his offer to watch the Oscar-winning A Man for All Seasons. The world is full of coincidence and having this film come up now seemed perfect. I have been awaiting the conclusion of season two before viewing \"The Tudors\" this year, recently wondered about actor Paul Scofield's death being as big news as it was, (being the first I've seen of him, I can already understand, he is fantastic), and then I had just seen the new Indiana Jones with an elderly John Hurt, included here, among a pretty big name cast, in one of his first roles. It seemed the stars had aligned for a bit of period drama, something that director Fred Zimmemann does not skimp on, nor does he push back the historical facts brought in by playwright and screenwriter Robert Bolt. If nothing else, all involved gave me a new man to idolize\u0097Sir Thomas More. The man had pride, moral scruples, and an unrivaled intelligence. This is his story, a tale of a man caught in the middle of right and wrong, and choosing what was easy or correct.The plot begins at the point where Cardinal Wolsey, (a bombastic Orson Welles\u0097when is he not\u0097in a role much smaller than anticipated), has failed to persuade the Pope to grant Henry VIII his divorce. Henry is attempting to relinquish the bond so that he may marry Anne Boleyn, (a very young Vanessa Redgrave, perhaps included due to her brother's involvement in the film?), and produce the heir that has been eluding him. Having married his dead brother's wife, in order to keep the country together, he is saying that the union was created in sin, and thus not true in the eyes of God. Being that the Pope himself was asked to allow that first marriage to occur, there was little chance he'd reverse his own decision by granting the divorce.In comes Sir Thomas More, a lawyer and old trusted friend to the King. He is a man of principle and thus a man for whom Henry takes a large stake in his opinions. Himself a man of slight conviction, Henry knows he can have the divorce and be done with it; however, he needs his friend More's approval for his own piece of mind. Because he knows he won't receive it, he feigns acceptance and his word that More would be left out of the proceedings so as not to be looked upon as a traitor to the crown. Unfortunately, a young fellow, Richard Rich, trying to make his start in the world of the royal court, once rebuked by More, is working with Thomas Cromwell, a man looking to take the lawyer down. More must sever ties with his friends and family, taking an ironclad stance of silence on the subject of the King's divorce. If he never tells anyone his true opinion verbally\u0097although the entire country knew it anyways\u0097no one could blow him in, even when swearing on the Bible. A shrewd man, More continues to live his life with the knowledge that he will never give in to temptation, never sacrifice his convictions, yet also never see freedom again.There is absolute superb acting throughout. Scofield is magnificent as More, showing the multifaceted construct of his core self. A family man above all else and a man strictly loyal to his King and country, despite the turmoil and scandal happening around him, Scofield portrays even the harsh moments with a sense of dignity and honor. When it is brought to his attention that a Lutheran has asked for his daughter's hand in marriage, he declines with an airtight case as to why, despite how much he enjoys the young suitor calling. He will raise his voice, he will give orders as his status deems he is able to as a man and member of the court, however, he will only do so if it is for a just reason. Always respected, even his friend the Duke of Norfolk, (a nice turn from Nigel Davenport), can't get angry with him when More begins a barrage of insults. Eventually, of course, the Duke must walk away before things get too out of hand, but even then he does so because he couldn't bare hurting his peer. The whole sequence between these two is my favorite: More laying a trap with words in order for Norfolk to fall into and see his side of the situation. Expertly written and executed, that scene right after Scofield gives up the title recently given to him barely eclipses the courtroom encounter and final diatribe from the man, aimed at the lemmings set before him to judge and pass sentence.The film spans a number of years, from the beginning of More's unswayed, steady tongue to the final breath he takes. Everyone gets older and the world changes around them as one by one they all sign their names over to the King, agreeing to his divorce and second marriage. Watching Scofield get older and the vermin Rich, (expertly played by the aforementioned Hurt), get more and more affluent with the years shows how unjust the world can be. A man with moral fortitude gets thrown to the wolves while one that can be bought and sold at the toss of a hat prospers endlessly. If I have one complaint at all, it is with the fact that Robert Shaw's Henry VIII doesn't come back into the fold after his brief appearance at the center of the film. His manic mood swings and infectious smile are endearing and a joy to watch. Henry must have been the first true Attention Deficit Disorder patient.",

            "content": "When King Henry VIII's (Shaw) wife is unable to bear him the son he needs to guarantee a successor to the throne, he forges a battle of wits and principle with his friend and confidant, Sir Thomas Moore (Scofield) to agree to a divorce so that he may marry Anne Boleyn (Vanessa Redgrave in a minor bit part). Moore's moral objections thrust both himself and his family into isolation as they're shunned by those in fear of, subservient and obsequious to, the virile king.Without peer, this adaptation of Robert Bolt's play is - in my opinion - flawless. Scofield took home a deserved Oscar for his efforts as the belligerently principled man, generous to the fault that ultimately condemns him. Leo McKern has seldom been better as the scheming, tactically minded Cromwell for whom the impressionable writer played by John Hurt turns to for mis-guidance and eventual moral ruin. Robert Shaw was unlucky not to have joined Scofield in the honours as the rambunctious and almost child-like monarch, more complicated than he appears. Nigel Davenport, Wendy Hiller, Susannah York, Corin Redgrave, Yootha Joyce and Colin Blakely co-star in solid, notable performances, and Orson Welles has a brief cameo as Cardinal Wolsey nearing the end of his pious reign.I've read that Charlton Heston lobbied vigorously to play the lead here, and eventually did so some twenty years later in a TV version which I've also seen - it doesn't compare, nor does Heston despite his stature and ability (he might have made a better fist of King Henry VIII, but Shaw has that more than covered here). While it's a play based on the 16th century monarchy and the subsequent split of the Roman Catholic Church in England (into what becomes the Church of England), you don't need a degree in history to appreciate the character study that unfolds with tension and tenacity. A definite contender for the top ten greatest film list of all time.",

Like other plays transformed into a movie, it remains framed by a proscenium rather than transformed into a thoroughly visual experience.

            "content": "The screenplay of this excellent historical drama of 16th century England was written by Robert Bolt, who based it upon his revised 1960 play. In the opening scene Lord Chancellor Cardinal Wolsey (Orson Welles, who has two scenes) has summoned counselor Thomas More to his office. What Wolsey really wants is More's help concerning the imbroglio involving King Henry VIII. The king, although presently married to Catherine of Aragon, wants to divorce her for his mistress Anne Boleyn. More responds that the Pope allowed Henry VIII's dispensation so that he could marry Catherine, his dead brother's widow. More says, (Now) \"he asks the Pope to dispense the dispensation for state reasons.\" No, More will not assist Wolsey in his dilemma. The lustful Henry wants a son as heir and does not have one with Catherine. Of course, Anne Boleyn happens to be fifteen years younger than she. More further tells Wolsey, \"I think that when statesmen forsake their own private conscience for the sake of their public duties, they lead their country by a short route to chaos.\"Will Roper (Corin Redgrave) wants to marry Meg (or Margaret = Susannah York), one of Thomas More's daughters. More refuses as Roper tends towards Lutheranism. Meg is strictly Catholic, like her family. Alice (Wendy Hiller), More's wife agrees with Thomas. Later, Roper will moderate his views and will marry Meg. In his real lifetime, Roper remained Catholic.Time passes. The Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marshal of England (Nigel Davenport), rides to the residence of Wolsey, who's dying of disease. Norfolk grabs Wolsey's gold chain, the symbol of his Chancellery position. Norfolk tells Wolsey he's lucky he's dying, as the king would have him imprisoned in the Tower of London. Obviously Wolsey has failed in his appeal to the Pope on Henry's behalf. Sir Thomas More is Wolsey's successor.On a sunny summer day, King Henry VIII (Robert Shaw) and his entourage travel by boat to Chelsea, More's estate. A feast is laid out indoors. But Henry's real purpose is to convince More to agree with his plans to divorce Catherine and marry Boleyn. Outside, the king says he is More's friend. He also states that he was not really married to Catherine. More is neutral and tells Henry that it is a matter for the Pope. As Henry cannot get More's support he raises his voice for all inside to hear. He then lies and says he will let More alone. \"I have no queen! Catherine's not my wife. No priest can make her so. They that say she is my wife are not only liars but traitors! Yes, TRAITORS!\" Then quietly, Henry continues, \"See! You see how you maddened me?\" We comprehend how dangerous the megalomaniac Henry really was. To catch the late tide, Henry's group leaves without dining. Thomas Cromwell (Leo McKern), new Secretary to the Council, is dangerous too. Cromwell takes in Sir Richard Rich (John Hurt), a faithless man of disgustingly weak character (a real historical person). He wants Rich to provide him information about More. In turn Cromwell offers him the position of Collector of Revenues for York. The plot against Thomas More has begun despite King Henry's previous assurance to the contrary.Time passes. At the Canterbury Convocation, a herald acting for the king extorts one hundred thousand pounds from the gathering of bishops and priests for perceived misbehaviors. (Their properties were also confiscated.) Furthermore he queries whether they will break from the \"PRETENDED See of Rome\" and acknowledge Henry the title \"Supreme Head of the Church in England.\" In other words, buckle or else (those that didn't suffered immeasurably). By breaking with the Roman Catholic Church, Henry feels it's his divine right to become the spiritual leader of England (!) as well as its political sovereign. At this point More resigns his position as Lord Chancellor (after three years of faithfully serving the king). He remains tight-lipped. More releases his household staff while Roper blasts the king's actions. More later tells Norfolk that the Pope is a descendant of Peter, the only link from Christ. The king remains adamant and wants More to bless his latest marriage. As More does not, he offends the king's supporters. Norfolk tries to convince More to concede, but the latter is a man of conviction. Norfolk retorts, \"This isn't Spain, you know. This is England!\" Time will expose the irony. Then the King's Parliament passes an extreme act that if one refuses the oath of the king's marriage, he is branded a traitor and executed. More later says that this \" . . . is directly repugnant to the law of God, and his Holy Church.\"So the last quarter of the movie focuses on More's shameful imprisonment in the Tower (a dripping cell) and subsequent trial. More advises his family to leave the dreadful country. But he has reasoned that he cannot be harmed by refusing the Supremacy oath as his enemies cannot prove his objections. Remaining devoted to his Church, More has a conscience and knows he will be judged by God. When he first walks into the trial chamber perceive how the court atmosphere is all stacked against him. The corrupt magistrates disregard proper protocol. Repulsive Richard Rich will commit perjury with worthless feedback. More retorts against the wicked fellow, \"Why Richard, it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world, but for Wales?\" Nevertheless, the dutiful More will quickly be found guilty and sentenced to surrender his head. \"I die his Majesty's good servant but God's first.\" Saint Thomas More, a venerated Catholic saint, was a gem. He championed \"charity, modesty, justice, and thought\" against evil. Incidentally, he wrote \"Utopia.\" Paul Scofield terrifically reprised his stage role as the beleaguered counselor. The film stands the test of time as one of the greatest films in British cinema history. The Oscar winner for Best picture, it presents wonderful performances and period costumes and sets.",

There was nothing extraordinary about the film before I had seen it; I'm not sure if I had ever even given it a thought before I put it on the list of Best Picture winners I had not yet seen. The 1966 Best picture winner directed by Fred Zinnemann, starring Paul Scofield and Robert Shaw was an absolute treasure. Making 16th century England come to life, A Man for All Seasons was worthy of ever award the Academy awarded the 1966 film.A Man for All Seasons tells the story of King Henry VIII's (Robert Shaw) desire to divorce his first wife Catherine of Aragon. King Henry had already received an indulgence to marry Catherine. As the widow of his brother, the king was forbidden to marry her without special permission from the Pope. After receiving the dispensation, King Henry VIII wed Catherine, but she could not bear a child. With no heir to the throne, the King and the rest of royal England was becoming nervous. The King had been having an open secret of an affair with Anne Boleyn and wished to marry her, believing she would bear him an heir. The King went to Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield), a devout Catholic who was soon to be named Chancellor. Despite all of the attempts by King Henry and his henchmen, More remains silent in his opposition to the divorce. Thomas More is a noble man who clings to his principles and the law and refuses any of them to be broken. Only willing to accept More's public endorsement, King Henry rigs a trial accusing Thomas of accepting a bribe. Under the promise of advancement, a former friend of Thomas's, Sir Richard Rich (John Hurt) perjures himself in court, leading to grave problems for Thomas.Paul Scofield turns in an incredible performance as Sir Thomas More. He subtly commands each scene he is in. When giving his powerful speech about the law, there is a wonderful close-up on Scofield who is exceptionally delivering the words. He played his noble character so well, the audience couldn't help but love him. Robert Shaw also plays the role of the unconventional King Henry VIII very well. King Henry VIII is so full of zany idiosyncrasies that embodying that character was surely a full-time job. Ted Moore was more than worthy of taking home the gold statuette for cinematography. The film was full of wonderful cinematography that got better and better as it progressed. The film opened with gorgeous shots, culminating with a glorious shot of sun behind the clouds. Another phenomenal aspect of the film was the incredible costuming. Elizabeth Haffenden and Joan Bridge won Oscar's top prize for costuming for the 1966 show. This award was more than deserved, as the period descript costumes throughout the film were exquisite. The film did not disappoint in at all, and holds up nicely despite aging 50 years.I would recommend this film to any fans of historical films as A Man for All Seasons brings to life regal England with ease. I would also recommend this film to any fans of Paul Scofield. I don't believe I have ever seen any films starring Paul Scofield, but after watching A Man for All Seasons, I plan on adjusting that. A Man for All Seasons proved to be quite a hidden treasure, one I will soon be adding to my home library!",

He had no qualms about ladling out sentences of slow painful death by torture to 'heretics' whose only crime was that they were as deeply committed to their own religion as he was to his. More's novel 'Utopia' speaks approvingly of slavery, although it's uncertain if More himself believed this. Since the New Testament condones slavery, I think that More did too.'A Man for All Seasons' is clearly a Very Important Movie. I prefer Robert Bolt's stage version, which included the brilliant device (omitted here) of the Common Man. Film director Fred Zinnemann, here doubling as producer, gets excellent performances from his entire cast; I especially savoured a brief dramatic turn from Yootha Joyce, usually seen in comic roles. At one point, Robert Shaw as Henry VIII seems to fumble, reciting some Latin in a manner that makes clear he's memorised it phonetically rather than learnt it honestly. But then I realised that this deficiency was part of Shaw's characterisation of Henry, and intentional.Less perfect is Zinnemann's handling of the camera. Despite splendid location shooting at Hampton Court Palace and other authentic sites, Zinnemann repeatedly opts for static close- ups of mundane objects. During More's trial, Zinnemann twice pans across the (impressively large) gallery of spectators. But he does this both times with a swish pan rather than a steady pan, so he seems to be emphasising the spectators at both ends of the chamber and ignoring those in the middle; there's simply no reason for that approach. A dissolve montage to show the passing of the seasons at the Tower of London was more clich\u00e9d than necessary. Talking of seasons: the title 'A Man for All Seasons' is never explained here, as it was in Bolt's stage version.There are the usual anachronisms, including the actors' modern dentition and Leo McKern's prosthetic eye. One error could easily have been avoided: Vanessa Redgrave briefly portrays Anne Boleyn with ungloved hands, even though Boleyn wore gloves in public (and long French sleeves) to conceal her malformed vestigial finger. Put some gloves on, Vanessa!Bolt's dialogue is taut and provocative, though just occasionally too contrived. Why was More's real-life final witticism (spoken as he approached the chopping block) omitted here? Zinnemann convincingly recreates a society in which the king held absolute power. I was impressed when the boatmen refused More's custom immediately he incurred Henry's disfavour, although it made no sense for the boatmen to quench their torches.I disliked several of the men's costumes -- immense squared-off tabards with enormous shoulders, surmounting so many pipestem legs in hose underneath -- yet I suppose they're authentic. But did Tudor courtiers really show fealty to Henry by wearing huge brocade H's on their clothes?At the centre of this drama, Paul Scofield's performance is brilliant. He makes it difficult to imagine any other actor in the role. My rating for this epic: 9 out of 10. I might have given it a full 10 if not for Zinnemann's camera decisions. I'm still waiting for a screen biography of Thomas Hitton, John Frith or any of the other martyrs whom Thomas More gleefully sentenced to death for adherence to *their* beliefs.",

Bolt screenplay has an anti-authoritarian theme. People in positions of power such as the King, Cromwell, Wolsey, Norfolk; are depicted as being either corrupt, power hungry or expedient.The acting by Paul Scofield is superb and restrained with effective cameos from Orson Welles and Robert Shaw who are more showy.

Vietnam was ramping up and we believed we would never again see politicians with real honor and character.This is not a proper film, instead a play and is treated so in all respects. As a play, it is rather simple, and aptly so as it is set well before Elizabethan drama added complexities to simple morality plays. The story is simple: everyone on the planet is flawed in some extreme way except for loyal good citizen, noble lawyer, loving father, staunchly honest Tom.The story is Tom's strategy to avoid being punished for opposing the king by never precisely _saying_ that he opposes him. Or rather his divorce. All the talk -- and that's all there is -- is about not talking.You might find some amusement in watching this in anti-Stoppard mode: the greatest word game is where no words are spoken, only anticipated.  I am reminded of a Basil Rathbone Holmes movie; `Woman in Green' where Moriarty says something like `All that I have to say has already crossed your mind,' and Holmes replies: `and my answer has crossed yours. ` But that's a grim game in the face of the heavy moralizing here.The point is supposed to be that any man should find his own truth and then follow it. But the moralistic stance of this story is absolute: there is only one truth in this film, and we are all asked to figuratively sign an oath.Well, not me.Incidentally, the history of this period is fascinatingly rich and complex.

The script has not be bettered in the history of the cinema, and there are few peers - perhaps a dozen. Likewise a handful of Academy Award winners may approach it, most pale to insignificance beside it.The opening scene on the Thames with the Royal Oarsmen, and the music throughout, is not to be missed. Music is vital, and so often short changed, or composed to pander to current tastes instead of illuminating the life and times of the epoch portrayed.

Unfortunately, the film just follows the script of Robert Bolt's play which presents More as just an ordinary man trying to save his neck with arguments and actions that smack of legalese and casuistry. It has More acquiescing to the King's and Parliament's demand that he recognize the issues of Henry and Ann Boleyn as legitimate heirs to the throne. More could not have done such a thing and in fact did not for if he did, that would have meant that he recognized Henry's divorce from Catherine of Aragon and by extension, repudiated the authority of the Church (through the Pope) in passing judgment on the validity of marriages.About the manner of living in Tudor times: Note that they ate with their fingers. The interiors of the castles and castles looked like barns. They spread straw reeds on the floors to prevent slipping on the damp and probably slimy flagstone floors. The aromatic reeds probably also offset unpleasant odors as the English at the time were not very keen on baths. Henry himself, especially in his older sickly age, was reputed to have sent ladies a-fainting because of the rank scent he emanated. This reminds me of Peter O'Toole as Henry II in Becket who needed the incentive of the companionship of his friend, Richard Burton as Thomas a'Becket, before he would take a bath.",

Never once will you catch him Acting with a capital \"A.\" He immerses himself utterly in the character, and creates a wholly believable portrait of a man facing a profound, and potentially fatal, moral crisis. Wendy Hiller does serviceable work in the role of noble suffering wife, and Robert Shaw adds another to the long list of performances that depict Henry VIII as a loud, crass, obnoxious boor (though in fairness, perhaps there isn't any other way to play Henry VIII). A very young Susannah York appears as well, as Thomas More's daughter.Director Fred Zinnemann takes a no-fuss approach to the material, and directs with a minimum of frills so as not to detract from the strength of the writing and acting. However, the directing style doesn't feel anonymous, and one senses that Zinnemann is in total control at all times.Everyone knows how the story ends, so the movie by default is a bit of a bummer, but it's still a bracing and exhilarating film nonetheless, and the depressing ending is offset by the thrill of seeing a story about a man who stands up for what he believes in presented in an intelligent way without a bunch of phony Hollywood hooey.Grade: A+",

John Hurt is also good, and all the other actors deliver convincing performances.

            "content": "Directed by one of the all-time great film directors Fred Zinnemann & with a really brilliant screenplay written by Robert Bolt, \"A Man For All Seasons\" is just about as perfect a movie as is possible to make. The movie gives an account of the conflict which took place in the 16th century between King Henry V111 & his Lord Chancellor Sir Thomas More, which eventually led to More's execution. Paul Scofield gives a towering acting performance as Sir Thomas More with Robert Shaw (also extremely good) as Henry V111. After the Pope in Rome refused to annul his marriage to Catherine Of Aragon the King separated himself from the Catholic Church & proclaimed himself head of the newly- created Church Of England. More refused to sign the Oath Of Supremacy acknowledging the King's position & also refused to countenance the divorce which would leave the King free to marry Anne Boleyn. The Duke of Norfolk (Nigel Davenport) tries to persuade him to sign a document sanctioning the divorce but More adamantly refuses. The Duke tells him that it doesn't really matter whether he believes in granting the King a divorce or not & that he should sign it anyway, \"for fellowship\". More answers him by saying, \"And when we stand before God & you are sent to heaven for doing your conscience & I am damned & sent to hell for not doing mine, will you accompany me there for fellowship?\". After he resigned as Lord Chancellor More maintained an attitude of silence before & during his trial regarding the kings divorce. His thinking was that by doing so they would be unable to gain a treason conviction against him. More hoped he would then be left alone to live out the remainder of his life in peace & quiet. However, the angry King wanted More's head & there was never any chance of that!. Thomas Cromwell (Leo McKern), the ruthless & unscrupulous chief minister to the King got an ambitious, young (& equally unscrupulous) nobleman Richie Rich (John Hurt) to bear false witness against Sir Thomas More which helped to convict him. Cromwell rewarded Rich for his treachery with a chain of office. When More sees it he finally breaks his silence. \"Why Richie, isn't that the chain of office for the Ministry of Wales? It profits a man nothing that he sells his soul to the devil for all the world, but to do it for Wales!\". As I said at the start Robert Bolt's screenplay is just brilliant. He took the movie's title from a writer & poet who knew him & lived during Sir Thomas More's lifetime. Robert Whittington described him thus:-\"More is a man with an angel's wit & singular learning. I know not his fellow. For where is the man of such gentleness, lowliness & affability. And, as time requireth, a man of marvellous mirth & pastimes, & sometimes of sad gravity. A man for all seasons\". Jonathan Swift wrote that More was \"a man of the greatest virtue this kingdom ever produced\". Just before the axe came down severing his head from his body More is reputed to have said, \"I die the king's good servant, but God's first\".",

What is worth staking your soul on. I find it both quite emotionally involving and sharp enough to be doing real philosophy.

            "content": "Paul Scofield is Sir Thomas More in this historical picture concerning Henry VIII's future marriage to Anne Boleyn. But he's still married to Catherine of Aragon, who can not give him an heir. So of course Henry wants the Pope to annul his marriage to Catherine, so he can marry Anne. Sir Thomas More was a Lord High Chancellor and a counselor to His Majesty, but he does not condone this action. \"A Man for All Seasons\" is very special movie to me, as it symbolizes not only doing the right thing, but staying true to one's self, and it's a very modest and humble film. Scofield brings these qualities and more to his character. Living simply and true. Using what God has given you to the best of your abilities. Pleasing and serving God over man. Scofield embodies sense and sensibility in portraying this statesman with firm resolve. His quiet non-statement of the King's demands is not taken well and is taken to criticize the King, because those who know him knows what he stands for and that his not saying anything speaks volumes - even though he says he's trying to stay out of it. Scofield deservedly won an Oscar for this role, and the movie also is breathtakingly beautiful with its stark and simple cinematography. Miss this film and you miss not only a film essential - but a history lesson and a lesson in living.",

He truly was a man for all seasons. His character was an optimal hero, never letting go of his beliefs for riches or a good name even when circumstances were less than great. He headed his household with wisdom and respect, in much the same way as how he handled his profession. It was obvious that he knew what he was doing, and that he was more intelligent than many of the other characters. Even though he was betrayed, he was not bitter nor was he oblivious to the offenses against him. This movie made me laugh, cry, and drew me into the plot. On top of enjoying the storyline, this movie was also educational, and contained life-changing qualities. The main character possessed righteous virtues and a good heart. He was a hero who was selfless and sacrificial, something everyone should aspire to be. I highly recommend seeing it.",

In a way, this story is about religious persecution.At first I perceived More as just being stubborn, as was Henry. But I do see More's point and belief in the separation of church and state, in the distorted view then held. For More, near the end did say clearly that God basically rules, Man merely lives in a temporal state on earth, and there is no \"state\" without God. now that's merging church and state.Ah but I digress.Great flick.",

To force his will, the king demands More's approval but More is resolute.\nThis fine film about religious discussions, arguments, and accusations. It deals with themes such as obstinacy, the honour of kingship and political opportunism but its main focus is the dilemma an honest man faces in a corrupt society. It is a literate, humane treatment of a true story profoundly stirring in its dramatic conception, appealing to the mind and the heart, and the ear. To the eye it gives some limited splendour in terms of set design and staging, but the performances take the main credit. Paul Scofield delivers a triumphant performance as Sir Thomas More, the man of virtue who wins the moral argument but loses a more vital one. Robert Shaw as Henry is very well cast as the intelligent, robust monarch. There is excellent support from Orson Welles as Cardinal Wolsey; John Hurt, Leo McKern, Wendy Hiller, Corin Redgrave and Susannah York.

His refusal to swear was seen \"as an act of malice against the king.\" More was taken to the Tower of London on April 17, 1534, and his trial took place on July 1, 1535. Sir Richard Riche claimed that he heard More say that the act of supremacy was a 'double-edged sword.' \"To accept it means to save the body and kill the soul, while to reject it is to kill the body and save the soul.\" In response to this accusation, More stated \"In truth, Mr. Riche, I am more sorry for your perjury than for my peril.\" More's son-in-law, William Roper, stated that More \"asked the people to bear witness that he should 'no there suffer death in and for the faith of the Holy Catholic Church.'\" More's original sentence was to be hanged, then drawn and quartered. But because of his status, his sentence was elevated to beheading. On July 6, 1535, More was led to the block to be executed. His daughter, Margaret, said goodbye to him for the last time, but he was too tearful to respond. As he was placing his head on the block, he muttered the now-famous saying \"Wait till I put my beard aside, for that hath done no treason.\" After he had situated his beard, he was executed.Sir Thomas More is considered a martyr because he died for God instead of Denouncing him by swearing to the Acts of Supremacy and Succession. In 1935, Pope Pius the XI declared him to be a saint. More is called the Patron of Statesmen.\"this is a cinematic masterpiece.",

Both are examples of some of the best that cinema has to offer. It's a shame that Zinnemann isn't a more well known director; he also gave us \"From Here to Eternity\" and \"Julia\".

            "content": "Fred Zinnemann never impressed me until I watched this movie. I had watched Julia before, but I didn't see anything special about that movie. In fact, I only watched A Man For All Seasons because Robert Bolt wrote the screenplay. Bolt was the screenwriter of Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago, two cinematic masterpieces, plus Ryan's Daughter and The Mission, which deserve a modicum of respect too. With such a pedigree, I expected the best from Bolt's screenplay, since I'm a firm believer that any good movie begins at the writing.Well, A Man For All Seasons surpassed all my expectations. This is a fascinating movie in all its aspects: an entertaining story, a beautiful historical recreation, and an intelligent exploration of duty, honor, truth, responsibility and moral convictions.The movie uses the life of Thomas More as a starting point to show the conflict he had with King Henry VIII over the Anne Boyleen affair. Henry VIII was currently married with Queen Catherine, his brother's wife. He had wedded her thanks to a Papal decree. But when the Queen is unable to give him an heir he decides to divorce her and marry another woman, Anne. This means he needs a new Papal decree overturning the previous one. He asks Thomas More's support, but More refuses on the grounds that he doesn't deserve permission to divorce and remarry.Nowadays Thomas More's adamant faith in the authority of the church may seem absurd, even ignorant, and his decision to die for his beliefs ridiculous. It's difficult to imagine a time when the Holy Church had so much power over people and a man could worship religion so much to give his life for it. But independently of what More believes in, the core of the matter is that he's a man standing up for his beliefs in name of a free consciousness.Paul Scolfield plays Thomas More with grace and a startling peacefulness. His words are always wisely chosen, pondered and calmly expressed in a gentle tone. He's the ultimate personification of reason, logic and nobility.Around his towering performance an amazing cast was gathered, starting with the always amazing Robert Shaw playing King Henry VIII. He shows up in only three scenes, two very small ones, and one that was the reason he got an Oscar nomination - in a scene when he meets More at his house to convince him to change his mind, Shaw plays the King as a maniac who unpredictably changes his personality from sweetness and pleasantries to violence and bullying. I've always loved Shaw because he never had any problems playing villains or unpleasant heroes, and here it shows how much fan he had playing bad guys.Wendy Hiller, Leo McKern, Nigel Davenport, Susanah York, a very young but amazing John Hurt, and an aging, fat Orson Welles complete the cast. A few words must go to Welles' performance - short as it was, playing Cardinal Wosley, it was amazing and also showed his ability to play villains.I can't find anything to say against A Man For All Seasons. From the moment we hear Georges Delerue's opening theme until the end, the movie does a good job of bringing the past alive, especially thanks to the Oscar-winning costume design and Ted Moore's cinematography. Watching this movie I in fact think cinema has regressed. Nowadays many movies have a teal and orange tone, so it was a delight to watch the vivid colors here. It's like one big rainbow, like watching The Wizard of Oz - and much like real life, since our eyes are closer to Technicolor than the washed-out, filtered colors we see nowadays in so-called realistic movies. The color red was especially omnipresent, and this type of symbolism just doesn't exist anymore in movies, which is a shame.Bolt, Zinnemann, Scolfield, Shaw, Welles, Ted Moore and many others are to praise for a man, that as the tagline says, truly is for all times!",

After seeing it, I went to my local library to learn more about Thomas More, the film is based on a play by the same name. The film's only drawback, but since it follows the play rather closely, so it isn't a drawback is that it doesn't show the profound sense of peace and joy in Thomas More's life. The film, out of respect for the play, fails to mention that Thomas More grew a beard in prison & when it came time to chop off his head, he asked that his beard not be cut, because \"it hath committed no treason\". After this film, Thomas More has become my personal hero and I whole-heartedly recommend this film to everyone. Those considering a career in politics should definitely watch it and learn more about More.The film is a decent job at capturing the inner joy of the author of \"Utopia\" and also is commitment to his religion of Catholicism. I want to add an editorial comment, to see the joy and peace in Thomas More's life when it was confronted with treason and death to the anger, hatred, and ignorance of Kevin Smith's next movie \"Dogma\" in regards to no chance of death, I pity Kevin Smith. I think people who watch this movie will understand that there are principles worth fighting for like truth, honor, justice, beauty, intelligence, and holiness. Those lacking peace in their lives can gain some solace for their troubles. Thomas More richly deserves his sainthood and this film does an amazing job at showing this unknown life to the 20th century.Rent this movie - Share it with your friends - Teach children there are values still worth dying for",

However, if you are bored to tears and wonder how anyone could stay awake the entire time, you're not alone. With so many other exciting period pieces made during the 1960s, why did this one sweep the Oscars? Preceded by Becket and succeeded by The Lion in Winter and Anne of the Thousand Days, it paled in comparison to either. Yes, the costumes and set designs were lovely, but the direction was slow, the characters tough to root for, and Paul Scofield's Oscar-winning performance was lackluster. He'd originated the role on the stage; didn't he have enough practice to give an exceptional performance for the camera? Just imagine how wonderful Richard Burton or Peter O'Toole would have been instead. It just grates on the nerves that neither of those actors ever won an Oscar (even though they were nominated for the aforementioned similar period pieces) but Scofield won for saying his lines in a monotone to match his deadpanned expressions.If I ever were to sit through this lengthy period piece, it would be for the supporting cast. Wendy Hiller plays Paul's long-suffering wife, Susannah York is their sweet, beautiful daughter. Leo McKern is Cromwell, and Orson Welles came out of the woodworks to play Cardinal Woolsey. I always like to see Nigel Davenport, and Robert Shaw has a great commanding presence as King Henry VIII.

And morality plays are not done much anymore. The real star of the show is not the cast or the setting or even the dialogue but Thomas More's conscience. That a man would rather die than do and say something he doesn't believe in suggests to us a rare man indeed, whether our time is Tudor England or now. Thomas More becomes the ultimate of God's creations because he will ultimately recognize no authority higher than God's and whose first duty is to his conscience, not to his king. Amidst a sea of people with competing and confused aims and goals, many of them venal and outright evil, More alone knows who he is and what he believes. Once it becomes plain early in the first act that Henry VIII wants a divorce and wants it now, we know we're in for a showdown. More, who won't even hold on to a plain silver cup given to him on a pending case, is certainly not a man to sign his name to anything he doesn't believe.Much has been said below about how great a movie this is. Perhaps. More accurately, this is a great play that has been very well filmed. There are elements of great cinema that are not fully explored here, not because of any defect in the filmmaking, but because this was a play first. Perhaps a more witty or rounded out script would have more quotable lines as well as subplot, but this is no such play. Movies made from plays tend to be more verbal and less visual: it comes with the territory. Film is a visual medium, theatre, a verbal one. Also, this movie/play is concerned with More and his unwillingness to sell his soul and that is such a heavy subject it leaves room for little else. If there appears to be a flatness to this work it is perhaps due in part to the very focused nature of the theme. More's battle to defend his conscience from all sides, including his family, is so consuming that it plays out to the expense of other elements like  character development (his family members are little more than flat characters--devices by which More can display his convictions). This is not necessarily a criticism; it is an observation. As far as morality plays go, this is about as good as they get. Luckily for us, most films and plays aren't morality plays--we would be crushed under their combined metaphysical weight. That being said, we can still use a good morality play now and then, and this is one that certainly bears watching, even repeated viewings . . . .",

A trusted adviser to Henry, who became for a time Lord Chancellor of England, More's convictions were finally put to the test when Parliament passed a law making Henry Supreme Head of the Church in England. Unable to agree to that (which would have effectively meant denouncing the Pope's supremacy over the church) More was charged with treason, faced trial and was ultimately executed. For the most part, the events depicted here seem fairly consistent with the historical record as I know it. Scofield did a marvellous job of depicting More's courage in standing for what he believed to be right, even though it would eventually cost him his life. The account of More's trial, near the end of the movie, was - while brief - very believable.It's a long time since I've dealt with the stage play of the same name. If memory serves, this is a reasonably good adaptation - which it should be, since Robert Bolt also wrote the screenplay. It's not an action movie by any means, but is rather a solid and steady account of one man's convictions - and the price he was willing to pay to stand by them.",

            "review_title": "Sterling Adaptation of a Brilliant and Moving Play",
            "content": "In 1520's England, Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield) is an intellectual and scholar who is also a friend and adviser to King Henry VIII (Robert Shaw). Intelligent, witty, friendly, is loved by all who know him. But most importantly, he is a staunch Catholic, and when the King tries to divorce his wife, Catherine of Aragon, to remarry Anne Boleyn (Vanessa Redgrave), More will only support Henry if the Pope agrees. More refuses and is hounded by the King and his advisers - the scheming, Machiavellian Thomas Cromwell (Leo McKern), the ambitious young Richard Rich (John Hurt), the coolly arrogant Archbishop Cranmer (Cyril Luckham). More does not speak out against his friend the King, but refuses to support him - because doing so would compromise his conscience, and indeed his very soul.Robert Bolt's play is absolutely brilliant, and this is a more than worthy adaptation of the play. The film does suffer somewhat from the exclusion of the Common Man, the narrator/framing device who provides a running commentary on the play, and the Spanish ambassador Chapuys, whose temptations of More show just how unjust More's persecution is, but overall there's little to complain about. This is a solid, well-made, impeccably acted film.The central question of the story is conscience. To paraphrase a line from More, \"What does it profit a man to give his soul for the whole world?\" While More's peers line up with the King to hold on to their temporal power, More refuses to give in. His cause is questionable at best, as even More admits, but as More explains to his friend, the Duke of Norfolk (Nigel Davenport), in arguably the key line of the play: \"What matters is not that it's true, but that I BELIEVE it. Or not that I BELIEVE it, but that *I* believe it!\" More likes Henry enough not to speak out against him, but he cannot reconcile giving up his soul for the sake of keeping the respect and love of his friends like Norfolk.One of the most brilliant passages is the film is the inquiry scene where More is confronted by Cromwell, Norfolk, and Cranmer, and they try to convince him to sign the Act of Succession. Norfolk chides More, saying that all of their friends and associates have signed, and that he should come along for fellowship, to which More replies: \"And when we die, and you are sent to heaven for doing your conscience, and I am sent to hell for not doing mine, will YOU come with ME - for fellowship?\" Paul Scofield is absolutely brilliant as More. His is a performance that is the definition of subtle; it encompasses so many layers of emotion and thought that it's virtually impossible to absorb in a single viewing. You never doubt for a moment that More is a resolute man, never think he will break. He has witty ripostes for even the most pointed barbs thrown at him; he is not only stubborn and determined, but likable and sympathetic. What's being done to him is unjust; he \"does no harm\", he simply thinks. It would have been an extraordinary pleasure to see Scofield performing the show live on stage. His is the epitome of \"show-don't-tell\".Despite some complaints by others about the allegedly poor supporting cast, I don't see what's wrong with it. Most of the cast are theatre veterans and they give theatrical performances - perhaps that's the problem? It's a different style than modern acting (or even most film acting), and given the material it works extremely well. Leo McKern is wonderfully repellent as Cromwell, More's chief prosecutor, while Orson Welles as Cardinal Wolsey and Robert Shaw as Henry quite easily steal their respective scenes. Wendy Hiller, Corin and Vanessa Redgrave, John Hurt, Susannah York, Nigel Davenport, Cyril Luckham, and Colin Blake all contribute wonderfully to the film, however brief their appearances; you really feel the emotion, needs, and wants of their characters.But the star of the show is Robert Bolt. Even in its abridged film, this is one of the greatest scripts ever written: witty, accessible, involving, thought-provoking, intelligent, complex, profound, and deep. The film is much more serious than the play (which, largely due to the Common Man, had a large amount of subtle humor throughout), but that should hardly be held against it. However great the actors, this film would be NOTHING without the wonderful screenplay, and Bolt deserves the greatest amount of praise possible for his work here.\"A Man for All Seasons\" is a film that makes you think. How far would you be willing to go in standing up for your beliefs? If you think you have an answer to this question, watch this film (or read the play) again, and see if you have the same answer afterward.9/10",

As with any historical figure he can only be judged by the standards prevalent at the time he flourished,and,as 16th century King - Emperors go,he was a politically sophisticated humanitarian. He was well - educated,multi - lingual,a patron of the arts,a keen sportsman.As a man he could be generous and compassionate,but as a monarch he could be cruel and ruthless.For all his life his main concern was the governance of England and the continuance of the Tudor Line through male heirs.Women could not succeed to the throne. When his wife,after several stillbirths and one female child had failed to provide him with the necessary male heir his preoccupation became an obsession and he became determined to remarry a younger woman who could give him the son he required.He'd already fathered a bastard, the ill - fated Duke of Richmond,but needed a son born in wedlock. Given the idea by Thomas Cromwell that his marriage to his late brother's widow might be declared illegal he set about trying to sound out great thinkers both in England and abroad as to the likelihood of such a declaration being acceptable to both the Church and the State. Perhaps predictably,it was the Church that gainsaid him. The Church would not have its tenets challenged,even by a King. His Chancellor Sir Thomas More,although a devout man,was not against divorce per se,but,as events progressed and it became clear that the Pope would not permit Henry to divorce Catherine of Aragon,Henry's only option was to create a schism from Rome and form what later became known as the Anglican Church.More would not accept his King as head of both State and Church and refused to acknowledge his supremacy. Two stubborn,determined and bloody - minded men,formerly good friends, became implacable opponents.Robert Bolt's \"A man for all seasons\" concerns itself with their struggle. As filmed by Fred Zinneman it has the benefit of some fine performances by a cast of distinguished British thesps and a ripe slice of ham by Mr Orson Welles as Cardinal Wolsey,a portrayal that would have wowed them at the Globe Theatre. Mr Paul Schofield(if ever a man was born with an actor's face it was he) has been rightly praised for his performance,but for me Mr Robert Shaw steals the film from under his sensitive aristocratic nose.His Henry is way and above the best I have seen in the cinema.He exudes Life in a film that for all its merits lacks it for most of its length. Yes it's literate,yes it'd beautiful to look at,but only the much - maligned monarch lifts it above the level of a high - class acting exhibition. As Mr Schofield suffers elegantly in monochrome Mr Shaw lives in glorious Technicolour.There is a real person here,not a saint. Henry VIII was a lot of things but he was not a worthy bore.The impression I get from \"A man for all seasons\" is that Sir Thomas More was.",

            "content": "So much has already been said about this Oscar-winning film that I needn't add more except to say I recently bought the video and still become captivated to watch it from start to finish, so absorbing is the dramatic dialogue. It certainly is food for thought as far as movies go, an excellent script.Paul Scofield, in the role of Sir Thomas More, walks a thin and delicate line as Chancellor, for while he must remain loyal to his king, Henry VIII, he does not abandon his own principles on what he deems right. King Henry wants an heir to the throne and will not allow anything to stand in his way to divorce his wife and remarry. This results in his breaking ties with the Holy Roman Empire (the Pope) in his pursuit of a divorce. It also involves his loyal subjects who must acknowledge the legality of such a remarriage, otherwise they are considered disloyal and are doomed.Wendy Hiller, as Alice More, the devoted wife of Sir Thomas, shows us how her husband's decision causes a total domestic upheaval and unfortunate circumstances for all family members and servants as well. I think Susannah York's portrayal as the daughter Margaret is very expressive too as she attempts to reason with her father in his final days. Everyone is greatly challenged indeed to find an inner strength to face the inevitable realities.I would consider the film \"Anne of a Thousand Days\" as a twin companion to this movie as they are so identical in many ways, both dealing with the subject of King Henry VIII's remarriage(s), the consequences thereof, and of innocent lives being hopelessly given up for the cause of preserving the monarchy.This is Drama at its best!",

            "content": "From Oscar and Golden Globe winning director Fred Zinnemann (The Men, From Here to Eternity), I mainly wanted to see this film for its good cast, and whether the awards it won were deserved. Basically, the story, set in 16th Century England, sees the last seven years of the life of Sir Thomas More (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Paul Scofield), the chancellor, and his ongoing disagreement with King Henry VIII (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Robert Shaw). The King currently wants to break from Rome to divorce his wife Catherine of Aragon, and marry Anne Boleyn (Vanessa Redgrave). But he also wants to give up his Catholic faith, causing More to resign as chancellor, wanting to live like a normal man. But Henry is determined to have More by his side and go along with all his plans, but in the end, More went against Henry, and was executed for treason. Also starring Oscar nominated Wendy Hiller as Alice More, The Omen's Leo McKern as Thomas Cromwell, Orson Welles as Cardinal Wolsey, Tom Jones's Susannah York as Margaret More; Nigel Davenport, Jack's father as The Duke of Norfolk, John Hurt as Richard Rich (his first major role), Corin Redgrave as William Roper (the Younger), Colin Blakely as Matthew and Cyril Luckham as Archbishop Cranmer. Scofield makes a calm but determined performance, Shaw is good as the mad king, the supporting cast are all good, and the locations shots are well done, a good historical drama. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best British Art Direction, Best British Cinematography, Best British Costume, Best British Screenplay, Best British Film and Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. It was number 42 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Very good!",

Scofield has the role of his career and he is quite good. Welles is awful in a mercifully short role as a corpulent cardinal. Shaw's performance as the larger-than-life king is interesting but too bombastic. McKern does well as Cromwell.

His current wife, Catherine of Aragon, seems unable to bear him a son and heir and he's besotted with Ann Boleyn. He wants to divorce Catherine but, other than the Pope, the main impediment is Sir Thomas More, a pre-eminent legal authority and devout Christian. More is eventually made Lord Chancellor, one of the highest positions in government. He resigns this position out of protest against the King's plans to go ahead with the divorce. Surely, now that he is out of government and out of the limelight, as long as he doesn't air his views, his principles aren't a threat to the King's plans and he is safe from prosecution?Directed by Fred Zinneman (High Noon, From Here to Eternity, The Search) a wonderfully lavish production. A noble sentiment too - a man willing to stand by his principles no matter what the cost.However, the film moves along at a snail's pace, has excess dialogue and ultimately feels quite padded. Also doesn't help if you know history (and/or, like me, have seen The Tudors) and know how everything will end up.There are moments of relief among the verbosity. Any time More is in an argument on points of law, his sharpness of mind, knowledge of law and expert use of the English language shine through - his wordplay is something to behold.Won the Best Picture Oscar in 1967.",

However, the most valuable aspect of this film is to show how if the political powers that be can insert themselves into the organizational structure of the church (specifically at the top above the Pope), then the state has 'effective' control over the church and they can bend the Church (including God's laws) to the will of the state.'Effective' control is not 'legitimate' control however and the king uses his political force and influence (including the threat of lopping off heads) to 'sway' religious opposition to agree with him and go against what God and the Bible (and therefore the Church) have set down. This is the pentacle of human hubris and tyranny. All moral and spiritual law and guidance is trampled and becomes subservient to the will of one man. Dark times and death follow for many years.This is why 'The Separation of Church and State' is a principle our founding fathers in the USA were so determined to establish after experiencing this brand of tyranny in the country the fled. Contrary to what many of today's haters of religion would have you believe, it does NOT mean the absence of prayer or the bible or The Ten Commandments from public schools or government buildings or functions. It means that the state has no authority over the church and will not establish a formal 'state church' nor will government employees run the Church. It is precisely to prevent a tyrannical government from gaining influence over the Church in order to use it to impose its will. Furthermore, in contrast, it limits the authority of the Church to control and direct the government so as to affect its will because both can and often are corrupt where great power and high stakes are concerned.So next time somebody complains to you about a public high school football team praying before a game, tell them to take their tyrannical tendencies and stick 'em where the sun don't shine.

            "content": "I consider myself a discriminating viewer, and I enjoy historical epics as much as anyone-- \"Laurence of Arabia\", \"Becket\", \"Anne of the Thousand Days\" and other period films are among my favorites. But I have never understood the wild acclaim given to \"A Man For All Seasons\", a perfectly enjoyable film that makes an audience think, but is so subdued that it never moves one emotionally. To me, it has always been a scandal, and a sure sign of the Motion Picture Academy's conservatism, that this film won a Best Picture Oscar over the much better \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", and that Paul Scofield, as great as he is in this film, beat out Richard Burton in what is surely Burton's most brilliant performance onscreen.             When I first saw this film, I could not understand the acclaim for Scofield's performance. It seemed so ordinary---no fireworks to it at all. Then, years later, I saw a college production of the play, and the actor who played Thomas More in that production missed all the tiny nuances that Scofield brought to his portrayal. It was then that I understood how carefully Scofield had created his performance.Unfortunately, his performance does not keep the film from being just a reasonably good historical drama.       The dialogue in \"A Man For All Seasons\" tries hard to be \"interesting\", pseudopoetic, and provocative, but just falls flat. (Robert Bolt often is rather disappointing for a screenwriter and playwright who is so highly esteemed. Think of Bolt's screenplay for \"Lawrence of Arabia\", for instance. Is the screenplay for that unforgettable film REALLY it's most memorable quality?) Just compare his dialogue with Edward Albee's savagely hilarious, barbed one-liners in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\", and you will notice the difference instantly. Nearly all of the dialogue in that film is endlessly quotable.           The other actors in \"A Man For All Seasons\" have been just as good in any number of films. The standouts are Robert Shaw as Henry VIII and Orson Welles as Cardinal Wolsey. Each is onscreen for only about fifteen minutes; yet they come close to stealing the film from Scofield.            This film is most certainly not the greatest film ever made, as some here claim---just compare it with the great films of Olivier, Burton, and Peter O' Toole. It is well acted, it is beautifully crafted visually, but it just does not have the impact of other great epics. And I am not saying that because there are no action scenes or explosions every five minutes. An epic can be thoughtful and quiet. But this film is very one-note, unlike other great plays brought to film, and most of the blame must be laid at the feet of Robert Bolt. \"A Man For All Seasons\" works too hard at being subtle without being very interesting.",

King has to get rid of people who cant see things in the right perspective. This film is bad. Director has made all the efforts to make this film look like a fight between good and evil. I think director missed the point completely. King Henry VIII's allegiance to Protetanism is not a religious issue. It's a political issue. How come people with with such myopic view make a historical film and get 6 Oscars for it? Surely world is blinded with religions. In the 16th century countries with a little pride and brain wanted to separate themselves from Italian Papacy and the only way they could do it was by 'reformation'. Its a shame that people in our times are so uneducated that they see people who brought this reformation as villains and people who wanted to lick the shoes of criminal papacy as heroes. All the characters in the film are shallow. Either they are good or they are bad i.e. film doesn't show that Thomas burnt six Lutherans and tortured many in his own house. Why should a historical character be glorified? Film hides facts like Thomas More was a freak who used to wear hair shirt and engage in flagellation. This is just another film which glorifies religious fundamentalism which Christians accuse Islam of but shamelessly practice it. Story not only denies that Henry VIII and Luther represents 'change' but it only treats them as 'evil'. If these people were not there we still would be sending pleas to a criminals in Rome asking for their permission to wear a jeans for that matters. This film is good as far as craft is concerned but it glorifies the character of a shortsighted man. Henry was a cruel man but will be remembered for Protestant reasons and thats what matters to me.

            "content": "\"A Man for All Seasons\" directed by Fred Zinnemann (from a renowned play by Robert Bolt) is truly superlative in every way being deeply-philosophical and relevant-pertinent to our tumultuous times, even though focusing on a long-past epoch in England (nearly 500 years ago during the early 16th Century period of Henry the 8th, Catherine of Aragon, Sir Thomas More, Cromwell, etc.), this movie is brimming with rich character portrayals and remarkably insightful dialog highlighting the moral-ethical struggles of a rare few to preserve authentic-unwavering integrity (as opposed to others, who expediently dispense with ethics whenever most convenient). The multi-layered characters presented here are those closest to the arbiters-of-authority, delineating power-struggles between Kings, the Roman Catholic Church, and sometimes even between common men of unshakable faith & unwavering humane 'reason')Sir Thomas More (portrayed with noble-equanimity by Paul Scofield) is of course the unwavering man of faith (to Roman Catholic theology) but also a remarkable man of humane learning & reason = a lawyer by profession who has studied the great philosophers in the original Greek & Latin (also the author of his own deeply-philosophical 'Utopia').Throughout this film, Sir Thomas More's sincere faith, air-tight reasoning and integrity are tested well-past the point of breaking = he is at first tempted with offers of esteemed position & place by King Henry VIII himself (who is scheming to separate from wife Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, but the Catholic Church and faithful Thomas More won't sanction this), as time goes on King Henry loses all patience with Thomas More's unbreakable integrity (causing Henry to spitefully enact the mantra 'what cannot be shattered in spirit, can always be broken in body'). But all moral judgment aside, actor Robert Shaw creates a fascinating 'Henry VIII' who comes across as over-confident (bordering on arrogant) but also charming when he needs to be and quite intelligent (although thoughtlessly cruel as well). Orson Welles, Leo McKern, Susannah York and a youthful John Hurt also give stellar performances that should not be missed!I also kept thinking that this amazing film although set in the early 16th Century still has so much to teach & enlighten us about the machinations of 'political' power and the fact that there are all too few men (people) of unwavering integrity that would actually sacrifice their careers (and even life) to follow the humane path of reason, compassion and sincere faith (without trying to gain status or power in the process).",

            "content": "From its extraordinary acting to the crisp, engaging dialogue to the gorgeous cinematography and stirring period-faithful score, this movie brings the inner life of man into focus more sharply than any movie I have ever seen.And just as the movie centers on the exposition of More's religous virtue in a sea of Machiavellian context, we also get to view the other characters in different states of moral growth and awareness...Cromwell - the embodiment of the Machiavellian state and it's advancement of the pragmatic aesthetic over the spiritual one.Wolsey - symbolic of the decay of a clergy so long enterwined with governmental/state intrigue that it has moved diametrically away from God.Henry VIII - the youthful lusty, ambitious hope of an England recently emerging from the dynastic Tudor-York wars, who cannot reconcile his appetites with his soverignity.Norfolk - a noble straddling the vicious intersection of duty to king and title with admiration and understanding for his friend who stands directly against that duty.Roper - a snapshot of impetuous youth filled with the brimstone of moral righteousness, but absent the moderate intellect for correct behavior.Rich - the most interesting fully rendered character, after More, who is almost diametrically the opposite of those qualities found in Roper; in that he DOES poseess the intellect and introspection for a moral life but is too charmed by secular trappings to save himself from eternal ruin. In short, you are witness to how Judas becomes Judas in watching Rich's decline from disciple to traitorAlice - a unique maternal archetype who's frustration stems from the inability to understand why the malevolent forces of society have swirled upon her honest and simple household. For her, the Reformation has leveled the home like an arbitrary storm.Margaret - an uncommonly strong rendition of a young woman in these times, who I believe is meant to show the genetic foundation of More's scholarship and moral direction.  She symbolizes More's heart and his studied comapssion for life.  As his progeny, Bolt wrote Margaret's part to demonstrate the inherent goodness in More's philosophy.  That is to say, that Margaret exemplifies the type of social and spirtual being that we might expect would More be king of the land.  Instead, with Henry as king, we see that society is filled with corrupt, pragmatic men who feel no obedience but to the next day and the next convenient matter of state.Matthew the Servant, The Boatmen, the Jailor et al - those familiar with the stage production of this 1960 play will remember that all the parts of this ilk (except Matthew) were played by one actor who was listed as \"The Common Man.\"  For film's sake, this concept was subjugated but still the resonance exists.  And that was to add the balance that with all these high affairs of state, all this intrigue, and all this consequence - there were still regular men and woman on the ground who had to live their lives with the spectre of growing anxiety and Reformation upon them. They are directly symbolic of people who intuit that with each passing day, an ill-word, a misstep, or flippant remark might very well put them at in the same peril as More; so they remain mostly muted, silent and drone like in the execution of the day-to-day lives.  As if the flower of England is wilting in this hothouse of social revolution.Were I to teach a World History class in High School, I would spend a week with this movie and classroom lecture to help the students begin their understanding of the Reformation and the importance of history as it relates to lives we lead today and where they may go.Obviosuly, one of my favorite movies of all timepaxvk",

            "review_title": "How is greatness defined?",
            "content": "The following theme is supported by the Classic Hollywood narrative structure: What does it mean for a man to be called great? One definition of greatness is defined through Sir Thomas More\u0097one who is morally upright, true and honest to his conscience. As observed by King Henry VIII, More \"stands out and is known to be honest.\" This particular definition of greatness runs contrary to another type that is made implicit in the film. Richard Rich, More's friend, sees greatness as being one who is popular amongst the prestigious members of society. Focusing on the character development of More and the subsequent plot progression will provide strong evidence as regards to the true definition of greatness, that is, one that ought to be sought after and mimicked in order to produce an ethically strong society.The inciting incident of the story is when More receives a letter from the cardinal of England asking him to help secure a divorce between the King and his barren wife. This would then allow the King to remarry and have a son to reign as heir when he dies. As established by the rule of law, a king could not obtain a divorce unless he was granted permission by the pope\u0097a task that would require More's recommendation, or \"pressure,\" to ensure its security. Immediately More is placed into a difficult situation where he must decide whether his loyalty remains to the King or to his conscience. If he sides with the King, he denies his conscience\u0097it is not morally right for a king to divorce his wife based on reasons that she is barren. If he sides with his conscience, he defies the king and places himself into a position of treason. More feels alienated and uncertain of what to do. Although he would like to please both, he is forced to activity\u0097to make a decision. The rising action begins with the King's visit to More, who, while attempting to persuade More's allegiance, raises the volume of his voice to try and intimidate his decision. More keeps his opinion silent because he knows by challenging the system that the law cannot inflict a valid punishment unless he actually declares he will not support the King with the divorce.Further conflict arises when a certain statesmen, Thomas Cromwell, and friend, Richard Rich, attempt to break More's silence through sabotage by saying he accepted a bribe (silver cup), thereby proving his disloyalty to the King and Parliament. More's vulnerability and aloneness increases as the opposition around him also increases. His good friend, the Duke of Norfolk, turns against him and even his family members attempt to persuade him while in jail to sign a document saying he will honor the King's request. This is the crisis of the film that causes More to sacrifice his ego against the King. He does not bend his position in submitting to the King's appeal despite the pressure, but rather takes a leap of faith into the unknown in keeping his conscience clean before God. The climax of the film is when More announces this decision after he has been indicted by the court with high treason and sentenced to suffer death. More renews his conscience before God knowing that although he was the King's servant, he was God's servant first. He is now a new autonomous being, announcing just moments before he dies his worthiness to enter heaven, \"God will not refuse one who is so blithe to go to him.\" More's greatness is an example to mankind. His refusal to submit to the immoral ways of the world demonstrates his amazing character and obedience to the higher law\u0097God's law. Richard Rich's idea of greatness leaves More to proclaim, \"I am more sorry for your perjury than my peril. For it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the world at a price not less than eternal glory.\" This film charges the viewer to examine what forms of greatness are worth obtaining\u0097temporal greatness, or eternal greatness. Although the former produces transient gratification, the latter is what produces lasting gratification and that's what matters most.",

He was never a very imaginative director.In order to insure that the scenes of the King, and his distortion field (whom allow him to be immoral) are received correctly, all his scenes are about fifty percent beyond what's necessary.AMFAS relies on viewers identifying with the noble integrity of Thomas More, which is pretty much a given since most people don't realize they're completely full of crap.

And that is, of course, that St. Thomas More must willingly give up his own life rather than publicly countenance a divorce, and thereby deny the Church.

This film is still fresh and has meaning to us all---about corruption in government. We should all be reminded that having a higher status in government does not necessarily correlate with having more honor.John Hurt's character epitomizes the lust for power---that the end justifies the means. But as we all know, \"Absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" The director, the great Fred Zinnemann, crafts this story expertly, showing the fall of a man who held true to his Catholic values. He is seen by the corrupt government as the villain, yet he seems to be the only honest man in England.I think that this film should be shown to all young people. Hopefully we can mold more people to have character like Saint Thomas More.",

            "review_title": "Sir Thomas More gets royal treatment",
            "content": "This movie concentrates on the last few years in the life of Sir Thomas More whose refusal to officially recognize the supremacy of King Henry VIII over the Papacy cost him his life. While More never publicly opposed Henry on this matter (at least as presented here) his silence was ultimately such an irritant to the King that More was ultimately convicted of treason on trumped up charges.One of the early scenes sets the tone for this sumptuous, highly literate production. The scene is a verbal duel between More (Paul Scofield) and Cardinal Wolsey (Orson Welles). Wolsey, for political reasons, was on the King's side. The scene illustrates the movie's sharp dialog and artfully sets up the basic conflict at the heart of the story. Here is a sample of the exchange:Wolsey: If you could just see facts flat on without that horrible moral squint. Are you going to help me?More: If your grace will be specific.Wolsey: My effort is to secure a divorce. Have I your support or not?More: The Pope gave a dispensation so that the King might marry his brother's widow for state reasons. Now we are to ask the Pope to dispense with his dispensation, also for state reasons? No your grace, I am not going to help you.Wolsey: Explain how you can obstruct these measures for the sake of your own private conscience.More: I think that when statesmen forsake their own private conscience for the sake of their public duties they lead their country by a short route to chaos.This scene has Welles in red robes against a red background, his great girth augmenting his imposing demeanor. More is lighted in contrast to a dark background. The scene cuts back and forth between Wolsey and More using medium shots and close ups. Brilliantly done.Scofield is exceptional as More, but I found the rest of the cast less impressive (excepting Welles' brief appearance). Robert Shaw as Henry VIII did not work for me, he did not project the commanding presence that Henry must have had. What we see from his Henry is mainly stagy, hysterical ranting making him look like a petty, weak man. Even though the sets and costumes are lavish and the English countryside and castles make for an elegant background, the human interactions smack of the stage play upon which the movie was based.The questions one is left with are what manner of man was this Thomas More and what is to be made of his actions. Clearly he was bright, being able to think on his feet and come up with cogent arguments and quick retorts. Such talents must have made him a good lawyer. He was a man of principle--not many are willing to martyr themselves for a belief, as evidenced by the fact that More was the only public person to go against the King. But men who believe, as More did, that the laws of God trump the laws of man, can be scary. The terrorists who attacked the United States on September 11, 2001 believed in martyring themselves in the cause of belief in their God. Some of the greatest tragedies in history have been perpetrated by those with an unwavering belief, usually in some God. Contrary to More's quote about forsaking private conscious for the sake of public duty, it is just as likely that intransigence can lead to chaos. Was More's rejection of the Protestant Reformation a good thing? I suppose that each person has to decide what principles to uphold and what ones to compromise, but adherence to a principle is not always an admirable thing. In spite of this movie's apparent intention to present More in the most positive light possible, I am not sure I would trust the man in a public position of authority.This movie is worth seeing for its beautiful filming, Scofield's acting, its literate dialog, and its easily digested history lesson.",

It's worth reading to compare with the film, and if you find the book itself read Bolt's preface. (If you want to know more about the period I recommend works by E. E. Reynolds and Lacey Baldwin Smith.) Bolt masterfully deletes or reallocates characters and adds scenes, some involving nothing more than the silent reappearance of a bit player. Thematically the deletion of the play's Spanish envoy removes some context, but historically the film's added scene involving the later-canonized Bishop John Fisher and assembly compensates for that, and note in that scene true economy suffices, as only one character reads aloud while medium and long shots do the rest.The film itself wastes not one frame, second or word, a testament to Fred Zinnemann's style and the inimitable cast, and no character tries to become something he or she shouldn't. This goes right down to the pitch-perfect voices of Cyril Luckham and Jack Gwillim, and the astonishing cameo by an uncredited Vanessa Redgrave. I still can't help but think one thing she does to Robert Shaw wasn't scripted, with his reaction caught squarely on camera.And somewhere a collector has the LP of the film's soundtrack, which I recall listening to in a school library. Delerue's score took up only a small part, while the rest was excerpts of dialogue spoken by cast members. Whether or not you'd seen the film, nothing else was needed.",

Most of the dialogue is like poetry, it has a wonderful sound to it. His representation of More as a moral, yet not righteous or pious man, walks the delicate balance between someone who stands for his beliefs, and a man who caves into the popular beliefs of the public is skillful and well written.The performances are brilliant, also. Led by Paul Scofield, as Thomas More, each cast member (even Vanessa Redgrave in a cameo) is realistic. I particularly liked Robert Shaw, who plays Henry VII as a petulant child, complete with boorish behavior and temper tantrums. But it is Scofield who is the obvious standout. Every nuance of his performance is true to the character. the viewer can sense that they are seeing the real man, not just an actor playing a character.The only slight drawback for me was Orson Welles. I missed most of the scene he was in in the beginning, because I was distracted at how horrible he looked.9 out of 10",

He carries the production throughout even when it becomes too talkative (which is more often than not) and pretentious. Oscar-nominee Wendy Hiller, John Hurt, Susannah York, Leo McKern and Orson Welles provide moments to curtail dead spots in playwright Robert Bolt's Oscar winning screenplay. Director Fred Zinnemann (of \"From Here to Eternity\" fame) also took home an Oscar really based more on the picture's look than substance.

Just in terms of pure history it gets very little wrong (More grew a beard in the tower and his last words were facetious--the beard should not be part of the chopping off because it had never committed treason).  This is a film about a man of towering integrity living in the midst of an incredible sewer of corruption.  It is a rare instance of our needing to know a bit about the man from biography  and perhaps more about the history of the period before appreciating the dramatization.  This is very demanding on the viewer, but so what?  The key element of the play is More's refusal to change as the wind blows.  The biographical element not terribly apparent is that he knows he is smarter than everyone else.This is one of the movies I first saw on TV as a teenager and had withdrawal symptoms over until videos became available.

            "review_title": "strong performances of course lead the way and a script that is most... Crumpety",
            "content": "I think that one of the things that makes A Man for All Seasons work as well as it does is that you don't necessarily have to agree with Thomas More's decision in the 16th century to not take the oath (in other words acknowledge) that Henry the VIIIth was the new King of the Church of England. I think the goal of Robert Bolt as the writer and director Fred Zinnemann and Paul Scofield who played More in the film just have to make the audience believe that he *felt* that way, and sincerely. Certainly there's no fault in that arena. I wish actually that the film were longer (I've seen that the play was actually longer/even more \"Brecthian\" so to speak) to give a few more moments or scenes to characters who have practically walk-ons, but as it stands it's a very good film - maybe just shy of being a great one.When I say \"crumpety\" in my summary-line, what I mean to say is that this is very much a British film in capital letters. This is big British actors performing material/history where people speak about the most British ways - but actually it is more than that. In short, Thomas More was part of the King's council - he actually took over for a couple of years as the Chancellor (in history anyway, the film makes it seem shorter), but disapproved of More's intentions to divorce his wife to marry Anne Bolelyn. More than that, he held his tongue - the 16th century version of pleading the 5th today - and that in a way made it even more of a grievous offense, and not too soon after he resigned his chancellorship he was held on treason to the crown and later executed (until near the end he tried to not swear or not swear an oath either way).The film has dramatic impact just based on the ideal of what a man has to do in being principled; one may look at More early on - maybe for a large portion of the film - and see him as stubborn, even arrogant, and Scofield doesn't sugar-coat any of that in his performance. He makes More into one of those pricklish men on screen who you either like or you don't, and in a way if you don't like him he's still compelling to watch. And again you may not agree with him about his stead-fast connection to the Pope and the Roman Catholic order - that may be an argument to have outside of this film - but of course context is everything, and at this point in history it was controversial to break away and start a whole new 'reformation' (what we know as Protestantism today, indeed the 'Protest' in the word comes from Henry the 8th himself).The other thing that makes the movie work is the acting, and Scofield, I found, was even more involving and interesting the further his plight got worse. In the scenes early on it seems almost one note, almost like in any other movie he might be a supporting character, which may be part of the point (the 'supporting' player gets his day, it's not really the King's movie after all). But when his situation grows more dire, it's fascinating to see Scofield navigate More's point of view and how he has to keep it together, even (especially) in the face of his family being all 'WTF' on him. Orson Welles also pops up early on as the Cardinal Wolsey, who has a really excellent, practically show-stopping scene with Scofield. And then there's Robert Shaw, who makes a helluva entrance, has another holy-good-god-and-heaven type of scene with Scofield (in short, he looks like he's having the time of his life playing Henry VIII). Oh, and John Hurt is Rich, who is... basically, ultimately, the part of a traitor, but an interesting and curious one to watch - probably one of the more complex characters in the film morally speaking, at least from where he starts to where he ends up.If there were any qualms I had with the film it was that some of these supporting players, perhaps by design of the story and More's significance to it, were all too brief (especially Welles, I can't stress enough how he does so much in a performance just sitting down for 5 minutes), and that, here and there, the characters, like the prosecutor, are sort of one-dimensional, or not as fleshed out as others in the film, and it becomes a little repetitive with the message. But overall, A Man for All Seasons is a joy to watch, sometimes intense despite the veneer of the regal processions and decorum, and Zinnemann finds another character in More - like Cooper in High Noon - who's main struggle is sticking to his guns in the face of conformity.",

The Tudors is a subject close to my heart- never having learned about Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn and the beheadings at school. \nYears later, when as a primary school teacher, I had the topic for the history curriculum, I was as thrilled as the kids to discover all the rule-changing, brown-nosing and backstabbing they all got up to. To support their learning we took them to London to Shakespeare's Globe Theatre where they got a guided tour then an hour long drama seminar with Shakespearean actors. Following this we spent the rest of the day and all night on a fully accurate replica of Sir Francis Drake's ship, The Golden Hinde.The captain, cabin boy and barber-surgeon joined us for tales of horrific injuries, grotesque medical treatments and just how many things onboard (and off) could kill you. The huge, thick oak beams that ran across the ship, supporting the upper decking were so incredibly solid that the captain issued a to-the-point-like-a-bullet warning,\"Listen ye scurvy dogs and listen well, these thick wooden beams are what? You there! The disgusting one. What are these beams?\n\"Very hard.\"\n\"Indeed they are very hard. So hard in fact that if you, when going up or down deck, bang your head not only will you really know about it, but I and the rest of the crew will laugh at what an idiot you are to have forgotten the most basic rule: don't smash you own brains in.\nYes! Laugh. I promise you, the first '*bump.... waaaah!' I hear I will be laughing like a drunken pirate.\"\nIt took about 7 minutes before the inevitable, \"*bump.....Waaaahhhh!\".It took the captain and crew no longer than the \"... Wa\" part of the unfortunate child's pained eruption to begin laughing uproariously, as if the actors under the costume were genuinely enjoying the embarrassment and pain (these things wouldn't have moved for Thanos with full gauntlet) of an 11 year old girl.I did wonder a little at this attitude from people paid to edutain children.\nThere was nothing inappropriate happening from a Child Protection sort of way, nothing at all like that. \nI just wondered why they made such a show of laughing at the poor sod with a Tom & Jerry-esque purple bump and poorly concealed tears. The next morning (after \"sleeping\" on deck with 45 over excited kids, many of whom had never stayed away from home before), I asked one of the actors about the brain damage hilarity.His explanation made me think;\"These decks are very low. They're only about 3 1/2 feet high, even the shortest of the kids that come here are taller than that. \nSomeone is going to bang their head. \nIt is inevitable. It always, always, always happens. \nWe've spent years trying to find the best way to stop the kids getting hurt (they aren't child-haters after all!) but it's so difficult. \nNo matter how many times you tell them to bend down a lot when crawling, crablike along the tiny gundeck, and no matter how many times they groan \"Yeah, Yeah, we get it.\" - someone always forgets and we have \"*bump ... Waaaahhh!!\".\nThis technique we use now sees the humiliation of being laughed at, act as more of an important and immediate deterrent than smashing your head in. Kids eh?\"\nSo you can see why I'm fond of the period and the politics. Years later I read the Shardlake series of novels by C J Sansom based on a hunchback lawyer loving and working in and around the court of Henry VIII.So to say that I'm looking forward to how Richard Rich is portrayed (by a very young looking John Hurt) as well as all the other plotting, greedy, ambitious characters, is something of an understatement.\nIt's actually pretty slow going for the first half bit things begin to pick up steak once we hit the final third, with Cromwell's devious scheme to shaft Thomas Moore over his opinions dangerously contradicting the omnipotent monarch Henry. However once Thomas starts digging his heels in and responding to every brainwashed, sycophantic jibe from Cromwell, Norfolk and the Cardinal with smarmy comebacks that are guaranteed to get under the skin of your interrogators, I rapidly lost sympathy for him. It's all well and good having the courage of your convictions but pick your battles eh? 'Red or white wine? Never! I'll die before I drink the red!'\nWhen it comes down to you (and possibly your family) losing a significant body part, hanging or even burning at the stake - don't be a dick. Sign the form. Just do it with your fingers crossed - your God will know you don't really mean it so it'll be fine.",

I could sense his rage at the weakness of his peers and his fear of what was to come in every line he gave. But to say that this movie was about divorce is to say that \"Psycho\" was about hotel keeping.  The theme of this movie is integrity:  how deeply do you believe the principles upon which you guide your life?  How easily do you bend to popular will?  And how do you do what you know down to the very essence of your existence is the right thing, when all the powers of the world would have you do otherwise? Thomas More tries forge his own way, content to let the world go astray without preaching to it.  But the world was not content to let More alone. And as much as Thomas tried to resist change, the world would not let him remain unchanged.  And so More paid with his own life rather than betray his deepest beliefs. How many of us could be so firm in our resolve?  Not many.  And that is what makes this film so powerful:  it portrays a man whose own character was bigger than that of the rest of the world combined.",

            "content": "An important lesson about going to the stake for one's indomitable faith, Fred Zinnemann's Oscar champ A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS makes for an illuminating viewing, preponderantly predicated on Paul Scofield's Oscar-winning performance of Sir Thomas More (1478-1535), an English lawyer, statesman and author (noted for his chef d'oeuvre UTOPIA), who opposed King Henry VIII's separation from the Catholic Church, refused to take an oath of acknowledging the king as Supreme Head of the Church of England, and the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, ended up being executed for high treason.One's mileage may vary versus monarchial idiocy and cruelty, but Robert Bolt's script (adapted from his own triumphant play) comes off as over-lofty by monomaniacally fixating on one through-line, viz. various personages, from King Henry himself (Shaw), his superior Cardinal Wolsey (Welles), his peers, the Duke of Norfolk (Davenport) his friend and Thomas Cromwell (McKern) his foe, to his closest kin, wife Alice (Hiller) and daughter Margaret (York), indefatigably try to persuade, wheedle, command or browbeat him into change his mind, ultimately for his own life's sake. However, More is far too obstinate on his way to his martyrdom, and the narrative hardly sheds any lights on his supposed inner struggle and oscillation, what transpires mostly is a virtuous More flouts any futile coercion with rapier-like counterexamples and repartee.That said, one thing is for sure, Scofield's grand poise and sterling elocution can be indubitably ranked as the apotheosis of any thespian rendition, his lilting vocal register and a deeply affecting earnestness is pure magick to witness, and when it is time for him to grandstand, what content he utters does not seem matter anymore, he is a thespian who is endowed with a show-stopping charisma that few can match, period.The rest of the cast is per usual (as in a British period drama), runs from cracking scene-stealers to serious luvvies (sorry, McKern and Davenport, both have ample chances to be less forceful and more mutable, which both dispense with bluster), Wendy Hiller arguably has only one shining moment in her last scene, and she proves that she is an equal force of Scofield in her intensity and pathos, which gifts her another Oscar nomination. Robert Shaw's highfalutin impression of the notoriously mercurial Henry VIII is also a delight (which garnered his only Oscar nomination), partially thanks to that he only appears in two occurrences - the lengthy exchange with More and a rather austere wedding celebration, with Vanessa Redgrave in a wordless cameo as Ann Boleyn, wordless but stunning nonetheless - because one might have doubt how to endure him in a lengthy run (please check Charles Jarrott's less pungent ANNE OF THE THOUSAND DAYS, 1969, which appears to share some of the settings), also Orson Welles makes a splash in his startlingly corpulent proportions and a profound gaze that can shatter through one's soul. But as this reviewer sees it, a young John Hurt also gives a vivid performance as the treacherous, prestige-seeking Richard Rich, telegraphs a palpable trace of subtlety that encompasses consternation, humiliation, vengeance and a moral vacillation that feels wanting in other key characters.Not a worthy Oscar champ to this reviewer's liking, Zinnemann's A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS is a sign of its times, high on royal prestige, noble legalism and religious adherence, low on human complexity, humility and nuance that seem to only prevail in an utopian version of our world.",

From the title onwards, including the opening scenes with More already displaying piety and honesty in the face of attempts at bribery, the film sets him up as an almost Christ-like figure, fit, as we later learn of course, for martyrdom. If anything it perhaps overdoes his sanctity and indulgence of fair-weather friends who later conspire against him, especially as there is a contrary historical view citing More's fierce anti-Protestantism. The intrigues of the Tudor Court are set before us and while More initially tries to keep his head down to avoid an augment with the King he can't win, in the end, he's manipulated into a show-trial with perjured witnesses which leads him and his head to the chopping block.With beautifully nuanced dialogue just as worthy of reading on the page, as hearing on the screen, we are drawn into the murky world of politics where jealousy, ambition and treachery all compete., all of which prove too much in the end for More even as he pragmatically tries to avoid them. Paul Scofield revisits his theatrical role with aplomb and even bears a physical resemblance to the historical image of his character. Robert Shaw impresses too in a perhaps too brief appearance as the blustery Henry, while Leo McKern and a young John Hurt shine as More's chief conspirators Cromwell and Rich. Orson Welles, looking absolutely huge, makes a big impression in his brief cameo even if you are very aware it s Orson Welles you're watching.The cinematography is excellent, the scenes by the river, the interiors at More's prison at the Tower Of Londin and his final show-trial all wholly convincing and director Zinnemann shapes and controls proceedings well while inexorably moving the story to its tragic, but inevitable conclusion.An intelligent articulate movie, bringing to life a famous story from history in true \"You were there\" fashion.",

And speaking of the story, it's uplifting, interesting, historical and well-written.  One thing I find amazing about this movie is that though it's very different from the original play (which I found amazing), it's just as powerful in every way.

How many movies made in the last 15 years can say that? Hollywood has spent much of that time turning cinema into an art form for children, the way it did to animation in the 1960s and '70s. Sadly, from modern viewers, it's a harsh criticism to say a movie demands their attention, imagination and emotion. Nowadays, if \"A Man for All Seasons\" is considered a movie strictly for grownups, remember that it was made at a time when most films were still family fare.

            "review_title": "Thomas More: A True Martyr of Catholicism",
            "content": "I've seen a great many people suggest that the values of the Catholic Church have changed drastically over the years.  Since \"A Man For All Seasons\" is about upholding the standards of the Catholic faith, I must say that I find such comments very distressing, since they are out-and-out lies.  It's true that more Catholics have been getting divorced as of late, but that can be attributed to more outside influences which seek to eliminate God and moral accountability in our everyday lives.  These anti-religion movements tell people that divorce is OK; and their message has apparently succeeded because, simply put, modern society (DESPITE THE UNYIELDING STANCE OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH) does not consider marriage as sacred as it once did.  And the vast majority of those \"divorced Catholics\" do not adhere to the principles of the faith.  That said, the central issue in \"A Man For All Seasons\" is NOT the Catholic Church's unyielding opposition to divorce. The issue is really obedience.  The Catholic Church recognizes the Pope as Christ's representative on Earth (with all the authority that such a title implies), and thus regards defiance of the Pope as tantamount to defiance of Christ himself.  The Church has and will continue to grant divorces in extenuating circumstances to individuals who've shown that they were married to another who had somehow deceived them or who never treated the marriage as the sacred institution that God intends it to be.  However, Pope Clement did not see a king with a runaway libido wanting to marry his queen's more attractive servant as sufficient grounds to grant a divorce.  A special dispensation had been asked by and granted to King Henry VIII to marry Catharine of Aragon, the widow of Henry's brother.  The marriage had been blessed by the Church, and Catharine, while unable to provide a male heir to Henry, did provide him with a daughter (later Queen Mary I).  When the marriage didn't provide Henry with the male heir he wanted, he decided another marriage would be more convenient, and when the Pope didn't co-operate, Henry openly defied him by establishing himself as the head of a new Church of England.  Now the Church does not look too kindly upon schismatic behavior, and the Pope excommunicated Henry as a result.  Henry responded by trying to force all loyal Catholics in England to not only swear allegiance to him (which Sir Thomas More had already done), but to renounce their allegiance to the Pope and thus renounce their Catholic faith by signing an act condoning his divorce from Catherine and his subsequent marriage to Ann Boleyn (he only started beheading his wives after the Archbishop of his own Church refused to grant him any more divorces). This, of course, was something Sir Thomas (masterfully portrayed by Paul Scofield in an Oscar-winning performance) could not do, for he was \"the king's loyal subject...but God's first.\"  In fact, his integrity was such that he resigned the powerful and lucrative post of the King's Chancellor for his beliefs.  Thus, \"A Man For All Seasons\" is really the story of Sir Thomas More's struggle to remain a loyal subject of King Henry VIII (played by Robert Shaw) without compromising his Catholic ideals.  But Henry VIII was a king who demanded utter obedience in all things.  The ensuing stand-off between two of the strongest wills in the history of England thus becomes the central plot of the movie.  Other prominent figures in this struggle are: King Henry's chancellor Thomas Cromwell (Leo McKern), who would stop at nothing to establish More's guilt; the traitorous Richard Rich (John Hurt), whose thirst for power meant more to him than his personal integrity; Alice More (Wendy Hiller), More's long-suffering wife, whom Sir Thomas seeks to make aware of his delicate situation; More's daughter, Margaret (played by Susannah York), Sir Thomas's pride and joy and also his greatest supporter; and Cardinal Wolsey (played in a cameo role by Orson Welles), More's predecessor as Chancellor, whose indecision concerning the king's desire for a divorce draws Sir Thomas in to the conflict.  This is no action movie, it's no romance, and it's not a comedy.  But if you enjoy exceptional dialogue, a good history lesson, and people who still believe that moral integrity deserves a prominent place in our society, then I certainly recommend that you watch this movie.  In my opinion, it is one of the greatest movies ever made.",

            "content": "There are some excellent discussions of this movie on this board, but none that addresses what I think is the major theme of the movie (and the play). This is, above all else, a profound statement of the importance of a strong ethical system to inform one's life. And, indeed, the movie is also an excellent historical piece precisely because this is a case where actual events were arranged \"just so\" to emphasize an ethical lesson. The climatic scene of the movie is when More's family begs him to perjure himself just this one time to save his life and to save them their loved one. While More clearly shares these goals, and definitely has no desire to be a martyr, he cannot and will not perjure himself because, as he tells them (paraphrasing here): when a man takes an oath, it is as if he takes his soul into his own hands and if he should open the fingers (that is, lie under oath), then he need not look for his soul for it will be gone. From that moment on, his fate is certain and all that is needed for his conviction is, ironically, a perjury against him. Thus, the enemy -- the evildoer -- is not the King, for he is in his own narcissistic way, true to himself. Rather it is Cromwell and (ultimately) Richard Rich who prove to have sold their souls for advancement. And such small and insignificant men they are -- important only because of the harm they inflict upon a great and moral man. The movie, and more so the play, is a forceful apology for absolute ethical standards that stand in such dramatic contrast to the situational ethics that surround us. The play was written (and the movie produced soon after) at the time when situational ethics were just being enunciated. Now, more than 35 years later, situation ethics have largely corrupted our moral and ethical standards (\"it depends on how you define 'is'\") and we are the worse for it both in politics and business ethics (or lack thereof). It saddens me to know that such a magnificent work of art made such a compelling case for moral absolutes (e.g., to perjure oneself is to lose oneself, regardless of the consequences, great or trivial) and was not more effective in preventing this deterioration. Do not miss this movie. Watch it again and again. It is a great movie in all respects that has a great deal to say.",

The movie takes place in England at a time where monarchy prevailed and divorce was frowned upon. The film also has a main theme saying that silence sometimes can be louder than words. The film may be character- driven, but it is certainly a fascinating study of this time period. As a history buff, I can appreciate the kind of art this film is. People may find this dry, but I find it fascinating. This film is about a man named Sir Thomas More and his infamous silence opposing the corrupt King Henry VIII when he ignored the Roman Catholic Church in regards to divorcing his wife Catherine in order to marry Anne Boleyn. The film has a fine cast and they all do an excellent job. Paul Scofield was masterful as Thomas More and he breathed life into his character as we, members of the audience, learned how big silence can be. Robert Shaw gave a likable, over-the-top performance as King Henry VIII. Orson Welles delivered a fine performance as the cardinal. John Hurt, in one of his early roles, was great as the young Rich. Overall, A Man for All Seasons makes for a fine history lesson. Being somewhat familiar with this time period, I was able to gain more in- depth information about the kind of man Sir Thomas More was. The script was dialog heavy, but I felt like that was appropriate for the kind of film it is. I had a rich experience watching the movie and I hope others can appreciate this history lesson.

            "content": "England needs an heir. Queen Catherine is as barren as a brick. Henry VIII falls for Anne Boleyn and needs to divorce his queen, but she is the aunt of the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope cannot grant Henry's wish. Anne Boleyn falls pregnant, and Henry needs a divorce now. He rejects papal power in England and the Church of England is born. Henry and Anne are married in January 1533; Henry divorces Catherine the following May, insisting they were never married because she was once betrothed to his long dead brother, Arthur. In September, Elizabeth is born. So began the Anglican church, the Elizabethan era, the patronage of Shakespeare and the conflict between protestant England and Catholic Spain, culminating in the dispatch of their doomed Armada; for good measure, Elizabeth, the virgin queen, had two American states named after her. All because England needed an heir, or because Henry wanted Anne, or both.Behind the scenes of this drama is the story of lawyer Thomas More, who rose to become Chancellor of England (the king's closest advisor) then fell from grace because his conscience would not allow him to oppose the Pope, who was, to More, the link with St Peter and therefore with Christ Himself. This film is an examination of More's belief in his god as represented by the Pope. What it is not about is divorce. Thomas More did not object to the divorce so much as to the rejection of papal authority and the establishment of a rival church - albeit catholic - with the monarch as the head of the church in England. Henry, it should be noted, regarded himself as a catholic until the day he died.More's refusal to swear to an oath based upon the Act of Succession, and his eloquent legal and philosophical debates on and around the subject, form the basis of this staggering film. In the background, his family gradually lose their status and their wealth when More resigns the chancellorship and is imprisoned in the Tower (of London). It is when we hear of his reasons for refusing the oath, as explained to a King's Council, to his daughter and to the Duke of Norfolk, that we understand his absolute faith in his god and the depth of his love: \"only God is love right through\". We understand that although he is responsible for his family in this earthly realm, when it comes to their souls, they are on their own and must go where their own consciences take them: we know that he would not perjure himself even to save their lives.This is an astonishing film. From the opening scenes, including Orson Welles's cameo, where the challenge to papal authority is explained, through More's confrontation with Robert Shaw's Henry VIII, to his imprisonment and trial, we are with the man for all seasons. We understand his predicament and we learn why he is regarded as a saint. Most of us know we are not made of such stuff as this, that we could not tolerate the imprisonment in the grimy, dank dungeon, then face execution for the want of the taking of an oath.Scofield's portrayal of More is one of the best performances in cinematic history and he delivers Robert Bolt's literate dialogue with the gravitas appropriate to the role. Robert Shaw, in his one scene, plays Henry like a kid in a candy store who needs help reaching the jar on the top shelf, only to be disappointed when he takes off the lid.    With actors like Wendy Hiller, John Hurt, Nigel Davenport, Susannah York, Leo McKern and Corin Redgrave in the other supporting roles we cannot claim any as standing out from the rest: these are, each and every one, the most outstanding actors and each part has been perfectly cast. This amazing movie won half a dozen Oscars and deservedly so. It has withstood well the ravages of time and glows like a beacon in the wilderness as an example of how to write a spellbinding (screen)play, of how to direct a dialogue driven film and of how to bring to life the complexities and machinations of a middle ages court. It is a luxurious slice of cinema that will live for a long, long time. We are privileged to be able to watch films of such quality.",

Paul Scofield gives a magnificent performance; so rare it is that such a noble, purely good character has been portrayed as compellingly. Scofield delivers some excellent dialogue brilliantly, judging every intonation and nuance correctly. The quiet composure and resonance of his character more than convinces.

The scene in the garden with More is impeccably judged by the two actors, with Shaw portraying Henry's changeable, forthright, restless and jovial sides to a tee.John Hurt impresses in quite an important role as Mr Richard Rich, while his master Leo McKern is an impressively dishonourable Cromwell. Orson Welles is great in his admittedly small role, offering a portrayal of Wolsey as a hawk-like realist, mumbling decadence. Susannah York is suitably radiant in a role that is a little two-dimensional. The photography well captures the era, with a beautiful array of locations and summery colours towards the start. A fine film then, with no real tangible flaws. Rating:- **** 1/2/*****",

After the movie was over, i remarked it as one of the best movies i've ever seen!, these are some reasons why i liked it so much: 1. It told you all about Sir(Saint) Thomas More and the reasons he became a saint, why he was beheaded, and why he was important to England. 2. It also told you about King Henry VIII and how he wanted a divorce to Queen Catherine and wanted to be married to Ann Boleyn. 3. The acting was perfect and they all were very serious. 4. It's like a religious educational movie!!!Winner of six well deserved academy awards, including best picture.",

            "content": "A Man For All Seasons is a timeless testament to society. Its hero is a man with absolutely no pride to drive any of what he does. He is simply someone who comes to a decision and shows through royalty's endlessly prideful provocations that he hasn't a fickle inkling in his body. He puts his mind and his heart before anything else, and though royalty and authority constantly have the upper hand, he continually, with no malice and only a stern and humble confidence in what he thinks, cuts down the strength of their image. This is a period piece in its truest and most meaningful form in that it's not simply a time capsule but also a story meant for us to reflect on what society has learned and how it has progressed. The outcome of one's reaction to A Man For All Seasons is that history has repeated itself in this field. Pride and hypocrisy have always plagued authority, and even those with none who at once have authority, like the main character here, are forced from it when individual conscience is shamelessly shown.Robert Bolt's dialogue is 16th century eloquence at its best. So many films almost mock its sort of formal poetic rhetoric in their attempts to portray it. Its delivery is a mass of wonderfully broad, stagelike performances from Paul Scofield, who was a no-name at the time who'd played the lead before on stage, Robert Shaw, whose presence is naturally fitting for the portrayal of wildly arrogant and showy King Henry VIII, and Wendy Hiller, a ball of fire, summed up as Scofield's Thomas More says, \"I married a lion.\" In a way, A Man For All Seasons is a difficult film for our impatient generation to watch, a rich-colored costume piece of 1966, but it's certainly worthwhile.",

A key character in A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, it is here that England's most famous saint--Sir Thomas More--was tortured before his beheading. The French got rid of their equivalent symbol of oppression--the Bastille prison--long ago. America did not make the courthouse where the Salem \"witches\" were railroaded to their hangings into some sort of macabre shrine. Germany dynamited most of Hitler's hangouts. Even Israel smashed Pilate's Palace, where Jesus was condemned. Yet Britain stands pretty much alone in raising a giant phallic finger toward Heaven, despite its history of crimes against humanity--toward Royal and Commoner alike. IF the historical record showed that the English were some sort of \"chosen people\" specially favored by Fate, maybe there would be less urgency to TEAR DOWN THIS TOWER. But after Saint More's beheading, they've seen \"Bloody Mary's\" reign of terror, King Charles getting lopped off himself to start a Civil War, Redcoats routed in a Revolutionary War, Flanders Field, buzz bombs, Carnage on the Subway--the list of signs demanding the TOWER's DEMISE is endless. A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS proves that Saint More, the Dreamer-Upper of Utopia, did NOT include a Tower of Torment in his Paradise. TEAR DOWN THIS TOWER NOW!",

            "content": "Orson Welles, years after CITIZEN KANE, said the hardest role to play was probably that of Joseph Cotten's Jeb, a man so determined, honest, and stubborn, he doesn't have many rooting for him, but instead, the praise goes to the flawed leading man...Orson Welles makes an appearance in the Oscar Winning A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, kickstarting an accusation that would lead to the death of a priest who would not bend for anyone, not even the King of England, who, played by Robert Shaw, has a voracious laugh as rich as fool's gold. Here we see the connection of Paul Scofield's Thomas More...Without going into details, he was one of the most important priests in the Church of England, and to quickly summarize the plot-line: More was the sole person against the King divorcing his wife and marrying his dead brother's sister. Ironic that, though the King is mentioned throughout, he only (really) turns up in that one jovial scene, trying to change More's heart by simply being his friend. That's a lot what Charles Foster Kane did with Jo Cotten's Jedediah Leland...But SEASONS is, despite an aura of Catholic propaganda, like CHARIOTS OF FIRE could be misjudged for catering to Christians (despite the main character being Jewish) - especially to those who shy away from religious-friendly cinema - more or less a poetic, and extremely ancient-set mobster film in its backstabbing and backroom dealings; a Gothic Film Noir with eerie statues and shadowy boats stealthily skimming through night lakes to darkened castle locations; or perhaps a modernized Shakespeare, but with words that are much easier to follow, and yet still delivered by British actors who seem born to speak them.Especially Scofield, whose faithfulness to God is the reason; yet for the sake of the story, and the audience, the mellow cadence he carries throughout, with only a few words raised, is what makes his performance true and natural and not what could have been a pontificating sermon, constantly reminding everyone that The King is not above God.There are flaws that can be blamed on the time it was made, the mid-sixties... From the decade's beginning up until around 1967, when the Renaissance Era began and would continue throughout the 70's, the FADE OUT button was overused by editors, ultimately deleting the overall importance and intensity of certain scenes... almost like they never existed... and you're never quite sure how much time before the new scene began: could be a minute or a year, making the actors have to start all over again.And while John Hurt's terrific role as a young, selfish Richard Rich, falling in step with Leo McKern's shifty middleman instigator, begins to get edgy and intriguing, the film quickly turns from a sort of Roman Catholic espionage into a downer where... well... our MAN is imprisoned for a very long time, viewed through montage, and then executed. Not only a sad thing within the story, but way too much time's spent on the decline right when things were moving...Words are spoken, and must be paid attention to, making this a movie to experience more than once to fully grasp the entirety. And while the superb acting exceeds the direction, which is also good, along with the fade-outs, SEASONS can be encumbered with deliberate angles striving to equal the greatness of the man it represents, or the celebrated stage play in which it's based. But overall, everything does connect. And Scofield is a MAN who, truthfully, is hard to root for completely...Like Welles had stated, anyone playing a character so \"right\" isn't quite relatable to we common folk with a penchant for anti-heroes, and along with his suffering family, including a gorgeous Susannah York, who understand putting God above the King but not above his life, while basically shoving his family aside.But that gives more power to Scolfield's performance. He's completely on his own. His face rarely changes. And yet, not only by words, he speaks volumes. For such a saint, he wields an often devilish expression. Making this one of those roles no one else could have played. And in the old days, the Oscars were magnetized in that direction.",

I'm in the camp that thinks it on the dull side; I was quite disappointed that Orson Welles' Cardinal Wolsey only gets one significant scene, early on -- his performance is so distinct from all the other earnest but muted Great British Theater performers that it stands out like an oak in a pine forest. Robert Shaw as Henry VIII is the other highlight, but again he doesn't have that many scenes to impress or excite one.The film is certainly not at all bad, and Scofield is compelling enough though his Thomas More is a pretty bloodless and dully noble figure in this script by playwrite Robert Bolt based on his own stage work. This is one of those films which consists mostly of conversations between the earnest -- if unrealistic and obviously to our modern eyes \"correct\" -- hero, and the venal king and his loyal but unthinking and morally careless henchmen; we're meant I suppose to feel uplifted and enlightened, but I find the setting of one essentially conservative viewpoint (More's unrepentant and absolutist Catholicism) against another equally repressive attitude (Henry's setting himself up as absolute leader of the church) pretty hard to sympathize with or get involved with emotionally. Solid photography and music, reasonably well-paced I suppose, but ultimately not satisfying.",

For example \"The other Boleyn girl\" (2008, Justin Chadwick) about his second wife Anne Boleyn. Or \"The private life of Henry VIII\" (1933, Alexander Korda) about his third wife and beyond.\"A man for all seasons\" is about the relationship between Henry VIII (Robert Shaw) and his political adviser Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield), and especially what happens to this relationship when the adviser has an opinion that is not to the Kings liking. In this respect the film has more in common with \"Becket\" (1964, Peter Glenville), although in this film the disagreement is between a political adviser and an earlier Henry (Henry II).It should be remembered however that there is no absolute segregation between politics and private affairs. The disagreement between Thomas More and Henry VIII is about the divorce of Henry from his first wife Catherine of Aragon to marry Anne Boleun (the story thus precedes \"The other Boleyn girl\") and the related breaking up with the Curch of Rome.More about the period in which the film is situated can be read in the novel \"Wolf Hall\" by Hilary Mantel, although in this novel another Thomas (Thomas Cromwell) is the main character.It is clear that Thomas More is the good guy of the film and Henry VIII the bad guy. Both characters are however human, that is to say not 100% good and not 100% bad either. Henry VIII is under great pressure to get a successor (that is, a son). Thomas More tries to elude the conflict (and save his life) by giving up his function, but holding on to his opinion. Unfortunately for him Henry VIII does not attach the same importance as the lawyer More to the distinction between function and the individual performing that function. He wants the approval of Thomas More, whom he respects, and not the approval of the Lord Chancellor. Once More understands that he has to choose between his life and his opinion he becomes a real hero after all.",

A loving family man, loyal servant to his king and ultimately a man of tremendous courage whose love of God came before all else. Paul Scofield is perfect as More and I can never think of one without bringing the other to mind. Wendy Hiller is a really feisty Dame Alice(as the real Alice was!) yet the scene in the Tower as she says goodbye is very poignant. I do feel that Orson Welles was miscast as Wolsey but that's really my only quibble and it's a small one. This is a film I can heartily recommend. It may be set in Tudor times but the theme is one that will never date, and Thomas More's example continues to shine.",

            "content": "\"A Man for All Seasons\" presents us with two layers of the same story. One layer is complicated, full of theological and political questions, but it ultimately is asking the same question as the simple core layer of the story: Should one follow what one believes in, no matter the cost? Thomas More has a high rank and office, he is one of the most respected men in Europe. When his king, Henry VIII, wishes to divorce and remarry, More's approval could mean everything to making such an action work. More does not approve, and although he doesn't explicitly say why, the audience should never have much doubt. The appeal of this movie is watching of the great moral heroes of film stand unwaveringly for what he feels is right, rather than what is politically expedient. It is a simple moral, yet a powerful one, and the strength of the movie is obviously Paul Scofield's incredible performance as More. As the title suggests, Scofield's More is a man for all seasons, an embodiment of dignity on the screen. The movie revolves around that simple observation.As a movie, it makes its point clearly enough. Perhaps my expectations have been ruined by over-the-top historical dramas which take great liberties with history in the name of entertainment, but while I found this movie to be pleasant and inspiring, it was still rather underwhelming. It tells its story and presents us with a wonderful protagonist, but there's little else to the movie. In fact I'm sure it's movies like \"Braveheart\" that have set such unreasonable expectations, but nevertheless \"A Man for All Seasons\" comes off as a glorified stage play (which is what it is) and unfortunately modern audiences will probably not appreciate it that much.",

A Man For All Seasons is a film that's still hung onto its acclaim but it hasn't necessarily stood the test of time. While it's quite good, it's certainly a disappointment for me. It boasts great acting, particularly from Best Actor winning Paul Scofield, who's stoic but sensitive. It's a very well written film with terrific stirring monologues, though truth or not, the way Thomas More stands his ground doesn't seem worth it to a contemporary audience. It's a foolhardy bravery that you don't see in film anymore because it's unbelievable. Unfortunately, given the nature of its period, it's an unnecessarily drab film and quite a chore to get through, with only odd lashes of a clunky sense of humour. Its biggest dramatic moments still carry the full weight but with its small scale of its characters and timeframe, A Man For All Seasons never transcends the stage and justifies the adaptation.

The film is about a man named Sir Thomas More who died because he believed in his principles on how to live a Catholic life, and unfortunately those principles clashed with the ideas of England's ruling figure, King Henry VIII. I also loved the performances in the film, especially from Paul Scofield who delivered an immense, emotional performance as More. Like all films trying to recapture the time period, I loved the look of the film. They seemed to have caught the basic grasp of what England looked like in the 1500's. Finally, the themes are worth watching this movie. It shows that a person should not be afraid to speak their beliefs, even if that results in persecution. The theme has always existed in reality and even more so in today's world with political beliefs, racial beliefs, and even sexual beliefs.To delve into the historical background of the movie is the same as describing the plot of the film so here goes. Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield) is a very popular figure in England. The chancellor has a loving family which includes his wife, Alice (Wendy Hiller) and his daughter, Margaret (Susannah York). His king, King Henry VIII (Robert Shaw) is determined to break from the Roman Catholic Church because he wants to divorce his wife and remarry a different woman. More disagrees with the king's decision, and he respectfully resigns his chancellor post in hopes to live his life out as a private citizen. But the King has other ideas, and he wants a public announcement from More saying he agrees with the King. But More refuses, and his silence may be his biggest punishment of all. But also his silence shows that it can sometimes be louder than words.Fred Zinnemann's feature has excellent performances all across the board. In researching the making of the film, I discovered that the director, Zinnemann had to fight to get Paul Scofield to play Sir Thomas More. The producers originally feared he wasn't a big enough name for the general audience. It is a good thing they changed their mind because Scofield delivered the performance of the decade, and he had previous acting experience as the chancellor. He originally played More in plays at London's West End and on Broadway, earning him the Tony Award. Scofield went on to win an Academy Award for his portrayal of More. I enjoyed Robert Shaw's colorful performance as King Henry VIII. Some people say he overacts at time by screaming. It's true that Shaw screamed often in his limited screen time, but that was how the King acted in real life. Wendy Hiller does a fine job as More's loving wife who is also suffering due to her husband's silence. This film also opened the eyes of the pubic to John Hurt, who was an unknown at the time. Hurt played Rich, an assistant of Thomas More but later on double-crossed him. Orson Welles delivers a brief, but good performance as Cardinal Wolsey, the head cardinal of England.I really enjoyed watching the film and see all these fine performances take shape. The second half of the film is emotional. Those who knows their history knows that More was executed for his beliefs. His execution doesn't take place on the screen, but the persecution More faces due to his silence is heartbreaking. Back then, people were not given the freedom of speech or expression as we are lucky to have it today. More never objected to the king's actions. He just never said a word and he paid the price. In a sense, he was seen as a martyr. He could be one of the main influences on why humans today have the right to speak their mind.A Man for All Seasons is an excellent film for all the reasons I have mentioned in the review. The movie is more of a character-driven film thanks to the snappy screenplay adaptation by Robert Bolt, so do not expect much in the way of action. The screenplay is dialogue-driven, and I loved the words or in some cases, no words at all. It delivered a fresh breath of air to More and it informed modern audiences what happened 500 years ago and why it's important to know what happen. It's full of wonderful performances, especially the much-heralded performance of Scofield. The movie looks great, sounds great, and is just overall a great movie. Remember, never be afraid to speak your beliefs. You can believe whatever you want to believe, and that is what Sir Thomas More told the world in 1530.My Grade: A",

It is literally perfect in every respect, from cinematography and musical score, to direction, casting, acting, and script (as adapted from the stage play). The opening scene alone (a summons to court being delivered to Sir Thomas More) is worth the price of admission. The language of the movie and the nuances of each line and delivery are incredible, even after I have seen this film literally a dozen times. It is one of the very few that makes me glad I can speak and understand English. Movies of this complexity and level of achievement cannot be viewed on a daily basis. They must be savored over a long period of time to fully appreciate the Director's and Playwright's vision. There is not a single weak performance in the cast--everyone (I'm sure) brought at the time deep acting credentials and craft to the project; we are not likely to see the work, for example, of Leo McKern or Wendy Hiller any time again soon.

            "content": "One of the greatest film directors of all time is Fred Zinnemann, and the shocking thing is, most people wouldn't know who that is, let alone even heard the name. He has a whopping 65 Oscar nominations under his belt with a great 24 wins. His films have stood the test of time and continue to be debated and discussed to this day. Perhaps Zinnemann is most known for 'High Noon', 'Oklahoma', 'The Nun's Story', and 1977's 'Julia'. All of those movies are excellent and have each earned their own numerous awards in filmmaking.But there is another film from 1966, which was one of Zinnemann's last films that not only took home Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor, but it is the best film ever made according to The Vatican. Needless to say, that's a pretty high honor, considering the film isn't 100% about religion. The film centers around the time where King Henry VIII was wanting to marry Anne Boleyn, and right before the King became the chaotic leader he is known for. But this story does not follow around King Henry (Robert 'Jaws' Shaw), but rather 'A Man for All Season' focuses on Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield), a family man who was the right hand man to King Henry VIII, at least for a little while.Based on the 1960 stage play by Robert Bolt with Bolt writing the screenplay, 'A Man for All Seasons' can be seen as an accurate portrayal of the downfall of one of the most infamous kings in England, not to mention the intense and brilliant dialogue that occurs. As the film starts out, King Henry is already wanting to marry Boleyn and leave Lady Aragon, because she cannot bear children, specifically a son to take the reigns someday, which is something King Henry is obsessed about. He has his lord chancellor Wolsey (Orson Welles) ask Sir Thomas More, Henry's right hand man to attend a secret meeting to convince the Pope to allow Henry to divorce his wife and marry another.If you're Catholic, you have been told this a big \"no-no\" in the religion. Already knowing that the Pope will not agree to this, Sir Thomas More, declines to help. You see, back then, almost everything had to be approved before the Pope and the church, and if it wasn't \"kosher\", it would be considered illegal. When More declines, King Henry tries to bribe More with power and riches. When that doesn't work, King Henry takes a more violent approach. All the while, Sir Thomas More sticks to his religious convictions and does what's right by his family and God. He never bows down or takes the low road. Instead, he takes the righteous path, always standing up to what he believes him, no matter what the obstacle is to overcome.Well, we all know what happened, King Henry overthrew the Pope basically, making it law that the church had no say on people's lives. He went on to marry five more women, some of whom he had killed. But what works so well with 'A Man for All Seasons' is the attention to detail of the time period, and the incredible performances by each actor. These actors just throw themselves into these roles and make you believe every single action and emotion, especially Paul Scofield, who is one of the best Shakespearean actors to have ever lived. He fully immersed himself into these roles and there are stories of how intense he was on set in character. It definitely shows here as he won Best Actor at the Oscars for his role here. 'A Man for All Seasons' is smart, beautiful, and well-acted, and remains one of the best adaptations of King Henry VIII's life out there today.",

            "content": "I work in Thomas More Street, London E1 not far from the Tower of London and when working for a previous employer (Barclays) joined their Drama & Operatic Society.One of the roles I was cast in was as William Roper, More's son-in -law who as Bolt states in his production notes to the play \" is a man of mediocre intellect\".Yes I thought ironically that's me! How could I compete with a character who was prepared to go to the block for his Catholic beliefs.Talking of the block, not far from my workplace is the sight where those who committed  \"treason\" and were incarcerated in the Tower, were executed and it bears a plaque bearing the names of its notable victims.Of course being filmed in 1966, I saw this film long before I was in the play (1974).We even did a performance \"in the round\" at All Hallows Church, in sight of the Tower and the film was obviously very much to the fore when we did our production.The intelligent comments from other reviewers I agree with especially the point that this film is about a man who tries to bend without breaking his inner religous beliefs but cannot deny his soul in the end.According to his biography, during his time as Chancellor More himself could be quite vindicative and witnessed with relish several condemned being hanged, drawn and quartered for their beliefs.Let us not forget why More was coerced thus by Henry VIII.He wanted a divorce from Catherine of Aragon, his first wife, who could only produce Mary (later \"Bloody Queen Mary\" in 1555).After failing to obtain a divorce from the Pope he set himself up as \"Defender of The Faith\" i.e. the titular head of the newly created Church of England and could thus give himself a divorce.It was important that the Act of Succession be countersigned by all the important court notables including its Chancellor.Sorry for the history lesson but viewers will appreciate the dialogue much better if they are clued up on this period of the Tudors.As so often when dealing with history, is is essential to get the facts right as a playwright (and film producer).Yes this does seems like a play with lovely location shots at times but in the interest of integrity, fiction should not be mixed into fact (faction) a la Titanic (1997) just to pull in those with a low attention span.Of cource we know the pressure film producers are under to appeal to as wide range of audience as possible with high budgets to recoup, so it is not surprising dramatic licence is taken in filming history and its been said before but audiences should not obtain their knowledge of history just from films.This film was easily the best film for that year and richly deserved the Oscar.Might I suggest viewers read up on this period of Tudor history before seeing the film to obtain empathy for the main characters and what drove them.For example it was essential Henry had a male heir as queens were not then anointed to rule this land and he needed a male successor.Cromwell was appointed and under pressure from Henry to find \"the final solution\" and we all know what that entails.He was driven to condemn More for not bending to his will in days when democracy as we know it, did not exist.",

First, it has all the merits of a fine film; fine writing, fine directing, superlative acting by everyone in every role.  Second, it's one of the rare movies that presses us beyond the movie itself to deeper issues.  Is God? If he is he is worth dying for.  We are given this question in a very hard context.  Thomas More is a reluctant martyr, dying for a proposition that few find even logical:  the primacy of the pope.  Even among the Catholics of his time (and indeed of this time) it is not something that often generates martyrs; virtually every cleric, virtually every nobleman, virtually every Englishman of More's time submitted.  More himself was what might (anachronistically) be called a \"liberal\" Catholic, enthralled by new ideas and dismayed (as that first line indicates) with the corruption of the medieval Church.  Yet whatever one thinks about his cause (for me, I think he was right), one cannot fail to admire his courage, nor fail to see in that courage a death that ennobles not only More but those who disagree with him profoundly.  He assumes that his enemies are following their consciences in good faith; he condemns no one, commends all to God's mercy, hopes to make merry with all in Heaven; he only asks, and is denied, his moral and legal right to follow his own conscience.  Yes, folks, there are saints.",

This is a good movie but when I think of the flaws in it, how \"good\" is it really? The costumes are elementary school amateurish. The acting is terrible at times with Robert Shaw spoiling for best honours. Orson Welles as Cardinal Wolsey is awful. He looks like a bloated whale ready to be torpedoed in his death-bed scene in the monastery. Anthony Quayle is far better as Wolsey in \"Anne of the Thousand Days,\" in fact no comparison. The music is impressive in captivating the atmosphere of the times, however. The story line gets a little too political though. I have to pass on this one. Some good lines, political intrigue and the injustice of Henry is amply expressed. But I found it boring and draggy. An okay film though. Worth seeing for sure. Unfortunately, this film is highly overrated. \"Anne of the Thousand Days\" (1969) should have won the Academy Awards and not this film.",

I believe Lord Clarke would have been well served to watch this film several times, paying particular attention to the scene where More's family demands he arrest a perceived \"traitor\".

            "content": "A Man For All Seasons\" 1966 was a film to whose makers many awards were given. It is by my standards not that good; I have appeared in the play and know its text intimately from many readings. And what I can say about the project is that this cinematic version of a good stage play is unusually good in a great many aspects--a rare achievement by the producers, William N. Graf and producer-director Fred Zinnemann, especially in that period between 1964 and the much later corporate decision to spend large amounts of money for special effects in the hopes of recapturing former glories through production values. Robert Bolt adapted his own well-planned theatrical version for the screen and arguably improved on the dialog scenes in the process. The music composed and conducted by Georges Delerue is dramatic and memorable without, in my view, ever becoming cloying nor intrusive. Costumes, settings and the lighting all rate special mention; in cinematic history, the early Tudor era has never I suggest looked as beautiful as it did here, not before nor since. Ted Moore's cinematography, veteran John Box's production design and Terence Marsh's art direction all won praise, while, Joan Bridge and Elizabeth Haffenden in their costumes brought a lost era to blazing and colorful life for millions. The unusual intensity of the film may comes from the honorable soul of Sir Thomas More, whose religious beliefs were sublimated to his ethical-moral dilemma; within the story line; this is a story about a man who thought ideas matter, and asked only to be allowed to act honestly upon his own ideas. Because they were religious and being misapplied to an increasingly reality-based world, he was challenged in that right--giving the plot its unusual power of concentration on one man's importance, one man's deeds and refusals. The film is dominated by Paul Scofield career-making role as Sir Thomas More, author, lawyer and statesman. His somewhat flattish voice and superb abilities here served a pedantic man, by giving him the human dimension of Scofield's own mind and charisma as well as his line readings. Wendy Hiller has little to do as his long-suffering wife but does in with great skill in my estimation. Susannah York and Leo McKern have more to work with and never seem to miss a step. Robert Shaw tries hard in a difficult role as King Henry VIII and does not quite succeed. Orson Welles is well cast as the rotund schemer, Cardinal Wolsey, builder of Hampton Court; Nigel Davenport is very good as the blunt Dike of Norfolk, and John Hurt as the weakling Richard Rich played a thankless part beautifully. Other in the cast included Corin Redgrave, Cyril Luckham, Colin Blakeley, Jack Gwillim, Yootha Joyce and Vanessa Redgrave as Anne Boleyn. By my science, the great achievement of the film is Zinnemann's pacing; as in \"High Noon\" and elsewhere, he gives the production a brilliance that perhaps its material only suggested, an ability only the greatest directors possess--King Vidor and Alfred Hitchcock I suggest among them. This is a film to be seen more than once, and one well worth considering between viewings for the problems, the examples of conduct and the setting provided for the playing out of human responsibility and its all-too-postmodern opposites provided therein.",

AMfAS provides more context after watching Wolf Hall and makes us consider how portraits of historical figures can be focussed very differently depending on who is telling the story.

No mean feat. Ably abetted by fine actors, not least Schofield, Leo Mckern, a young John Hurt, Susannah York and of course he incomparable Robert Shaw he contrives to make 16th Cenury England relevant. (And yes, Orson Welles was great in a cameo as Wolsey)It is in many ways difficult in this age of crash, wham, thank you man film making to remember that film can be thought provoking and meaningful. Difficult topics such as loyalty and principle are today so relevant but yet ignored. The Constant Gardner, by Walter Salles spring to mind as a recent mainstream film that attempts something similar.I remember many years ago reading that good films can only be made from bad books/plays. I think A Man For All Seasons proves this wrong. It is not that a good book overpowers film, as much as a good book/script/play overwhelms a bad film maker.Hats off. Let us all vote this so much higher as an example of what food film making can do with a good source.",

And this is despite the knowledge that this is almost certainly not an accurate account of Sir Thomas More.Indeed Robert Bolt's play is taken from mainly the accounts of Will Roper who was more than predisposed to paint a pretty picture of Sir Thomas, what is missing (as we now believe) is the elements of arrogance, and righteousness, that led this religious zealot to acts of violence against heretics.  This does not take away the importance of More's Faith, but does question the tolerance and modesty so amply displayed in the movie.Still, this really does not bother me: the historical accuracy is not the point.  To me, Paul Schofield's performance, and Robert Bolt's screenplay sell the value of truth and the importance of tolerance, and makes one question whether life is worth living if it is not lived with integrity, almost regardless of religious belief.My favourite moments are when More tells Roper the danger of knocking down laws to catch the devil, and More's subtle, and yet damning observations to Sir Richard Rich at his trial.So how can I feel good about a hero who loses his head?  Because of the love (for his family) he conveys, because of his clear conscience, because of his faith.  I wish I had More's faith.",

            "content": "I am very surprised my uncle was the first source from which I heard about this film - it seems like it should be much more famous than it is. It won the academy award for Best Picture of 1966, and it co- stars famous actors Orson Welles, Robert Shaw, and John Hurt. The strongest aspects of this film are the writing and performances; combined, these two elements form a great movie.Not mentioned above, Paul Scofield, who I have never heard of prior to seeing this film, carries this film with a brilliant performance. He plays Thomas More, a man defiant to man's law if God's law says differently. This is the essence of his personality, and he is a character who is full of wisdom and a great sense of logic in order to defend himself against the accusations of the corrupt. While his wisdom and logic do not ultimately save him, these characteristics form one of the most inspirational characters I have ever seen on film. Scofield plays More as a man who calmly accepts his fate while standing by his words and beliefs, rather than pleading his allegiance to the corruption within England's government.The supporting cast - especially John Hurt - do a good job of building up More even more (pun not intended) by portraying corrupt individuals who More has tried to help. More always has the best intentions; John Hurt's character is looking for employment at the beginning of the film, and More tries to convince him to become a teacher to avoid the corruption of government, and offers him a bribe he has received in order to get the man started. At first it seems possible that Hurt's character will remain loyal to More, but instead uses the fact that he was \"bribed\" by More to obtain a post within the government. It is heartbreaking to listen to Hurt's character lie about More late in the film in order to just keep climbing up the ladder, a situation More was trying to prevent entirely for the best intentions.Most of the film consists of inspiring monologues through More, an aspect I love since I think monologues are difficult to pull off correctly and are extremely effective in developing character. Scofield does it with mastery. I think it makes sense that this work stems from a play because I see it more fitting to be performed on stage than I see it as a cinematic work. If the film was more cinematic I would give it a perfect rating, but to me the only really visually captivating scene in the film was the penultimate scene: the trial for More's life. As my uncle says, in a way, this film makes you \"want to be a better person.\"",

Some of the casting could have been better. Orson Welles appears drunk and does not play Wolsey nearly as well as Anthony Quayle in Anne of a Thousand Days. Leo McKern is not as convincing as Thomas Cromwell as was John Colicos in that movie. Robert Shaw gave a poor performance as Henry VIII - his spitting at the mouth during his loud ranting, and maniacal laughing at other times was over-the-top and made the ruthless but shrewd king appear to be insane. The comment at the end that Henry died of syphilis is not historically accurate. However, most of the rest of the cast (for example John Hurt) perform very well. History reveals Thomas More to be clever and pious, but also stubborn and self-righteous, so his portrayal in the movie is historically accurate. The movie is for the most part well- written and the cinematography is very good.",

While not always fully comprehensible for someone enjoying this movie nowadays, the basic plot can universally be appreciated: a man fighting for his convictions in a dangerous climate.Objectively speaking, the film obviously has a slow-pace and is dialogue-driven as well as pensive.More is the centre of the movie, the driving force, the formative and indispensable factor whose singularity is partially what makes this movie so memorable.He's a lawful and law-abiding man with an impressive set of ideals, a remarkable sense of sacrifice in a time of total hypocrisy. He doesn't give in to the hostile peer-pressure and therefore becomes the victim of a system of justice which has been perverted. To be honest, I was not particularly aware of the life of Thomas More outside of his literary achievement, which made the execution even more surprising- and tragic.Paul Scofield is superb in his calm, yet perfectly eloquent and persuasive performance.Henry the Eighth, the tyrannical, inconvenient, sinful, semi-heretic and impulsive king, is also well-played by Shaw.Additionally, cinephiles can also rejoice themselves with the appearances of John Hurt or Orson Welles.Generally, the direction is the product of a skillful professional who executes the film effortlessly and flawlessly. This technical skillfulness is reflected in numerous other instances.The truly impeccable production design is perfectly instantiated by the authentic costumes.Furthermore, the music itself is also splendid and seems to have been directly taken from the time.Finally, the sublime and fantastical cinematography offers a focused shot composition which is pleasantly coherent and structured. The use of technicolor is also appreciated.In conclusion, whilst not overtly exciting, this drama is a qualitative, tremendously well-done and thought-provoking piece of cinematic art. It definitely deserved all the Oscars it was nominated for.",

            "content": "By 1527, the Roman Catholic Church had already been in turmoil after Martin Luther's historic break a decade earlier, and now Henry VIII was threatening to do the same thing in England. The king's main bone of contention had to do with Pope Clement's stubborn refusal to grant him a divorce from Catherine of Aragon so that he could marry Anne Boleyn. And out of this clash of religious dogma came Robert Bolt's brilliant play \"A Man For All Seasons\".Bolt's drama became a hit first in London's West End with respected stage actor Paul Scofield headlining as Sir Thomas More. When \"A Man For All Seasons\" debuted on Broadway, Scofield recreated his role and won a Tony for his performance. Oscar winning director Fred Zinnemann was an admirer and wanted to adapt it into a motion picture. Because Scofield was little known across the Atlantic, the producers preferred Richard Burton or Laurence Olivier. To Zinnemann's credit, he insisted on preserving the play's integrity by having Scofield portray More in the screen version, putting to rest Charlton Heston's fond wish to be cast as the Lord Chancellor.Thanks to Bolt's experience with David Lean on LAWRENCE OF ARABIA and DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, he was perfectly qualified to adapt his own play for the screen. To keep the budget within $2 million, Zinnemann and his actors, which included Wendy Hiller, Robert Shaw, Leo McKern, Orson Welles, and Susannah York agreed to work for a fraction of their normal salaries. Vanessa Redgrave, appearing in a one-scene cameo as Anne Boleyn, didn't take any payment at all.",

From the page, Scofield, Hiller, McKern, Shaw, York, Davenport, Redgrave, et al, spoke the living dialogue. The only difference that I could detect from the original text is an improvement: the movie downplays the Common Man, who tends to alienate the play. Oh ye gods and little fishes, when will we again see a movie that so tellingly portrays the ultimate fascination of ideas, and does so with such reverence to the very vehicles of ideas: words! >",

Therefore many industry insiders were surprised when Columbia Pictures announced that timeworn veteran Fred Zinnemann would direct \"A Man for All Seasons\". The fact that it was an old-fashioned period piece, adapted from a stage play, seemed to guarantee that the studio had a guaranteed box office flop on its hands.The film is about King Henry VIII of England, who in 1530 wanted a divorce because his wife could not give him a male heir. However, the king's chancellor, Sir Thomas More, opposed this strongly.When principal shooting started, Colombia Pictures had begun to be understandably nervous about \"A Man for All Seasons\" and its box office potential. Consequently, only a minimal budget was allocated to the project. The producer was also more interested in another movie he was responsible for. However, this brought with it some unexpected, positive side effects. It meant that Fred Zinnemann was largely given free rein to make the film exactly the way he wanted.The director insisted on using Paul Scofield in the male lead role, even though the actor was almost unknown to the moviegoing audience. Like all the other thespians, Scofield then worked well below his usual salary to keep the budget down. In fact, Vanessa Redgrave didn't require any payment at all to play Anne Boleyn.Against all odds, \"A Man for All Seasons\" became a big, international hit at the box office. And even though several other films grossed more money overall, executives at Columbia Pictures could still be pleased. With its modest budget \"A Man for All Seasons\" had the highest return over production cost of any picture that year. Not bad for a clever little movie that nobody really had believed in.",

            "content": "The movie is historically accurate taking place in 16th-century England, they travel by paddle boats, and wear particular clothes, hats and necklaces or ornaments to symbolize their positions in wealth, church or politics. More wanted to be a monk before he decided to serve his country in the field of politics, so it seemed accurate in the movie that he offered prayers. He was accepted into Lincoln's inn where he studied law and became a barrister. His knowledge of law is shown when he is being accused of different things, and he is able to protect himself with witnesses and copies of letters. He was favored by the King, Henry VIII, which was shown in the movie, because the King traveled to see him and ask him for advice. More was Lord Chancellor, but since he refused to endorse the King's plan, to divorce his wife Katherine of Aragon, his fall came quickly. He resigned and kept silent, and we assume it was because of his disapproval of the king's stand toward the church. He didn't attend the coronation of the King's new wife, and it was obvious in the movie that the King wasn't pleased with his absence. More refused to swear to the Act of Succession and the Oath of Supremacy, so he was committed to the Tower of London. He was found guilty of high treason and beheaded. His final noble words on the scaffold were: \"I die the King's good servant, but God's First.\" I think the messages in this movie, the acting and historical accuracy are what make this movie of high value. The acting was impressive; by the end, you have angry feelings toward those who accuse More, and sad feelings for More because you know that he doesn't deserve to be punished. I especially felt sympathy and sadness with the characters during the prison scene, when More saw his family for the last time. They did a brilliant job of showing how much they cared and loved each other. Some themes of this movie are that you should have moral courage and stand up for the principles you believe in, and don't bend and change your opinions according to the majority. You should worry more about what God will think of you and the conscience you will have to live with for making that choice.",

And in this same time temporal kings absolutely believed that it was their divine right to rule with impunity over the masses.Combine these conditions with a transcendent confrontation between 2 of the most intricate and influential intellectual giants of the era and you've got the basis for a truly epic tale - and it's not fiction.Add a gifted modern playwright and a superb cinematic director and let them work their magic. The result is one of the finest dramatic expositions ever brought before the public.There are plenty of other commenters with details and technical observations far superior to what I could offer so I won't bother adding to them. I will say that if you figure there could be nothing remotely interesting or inspiring in a conflict between a narcissistic, power-mad potentate and a pious religious scholar you're absolutely wrong and missing out on a real opportunity.",

His denial is based upon the teaching of the Catholic Church and he is beheaded for committing treason. The director does a good job of showing the relationships that are involved between the King and the common people as well as the king and the Catholic Church, this film portrays relationships and how they are affected when one who is willing to stand up on his own changes them. More being a strong believer in his faith is shown losing all that he has due to his stance on the King's divorce, he not only loses his possessions but also his life and dies as a martyr. The film shows the tensions between the King and More and also the tension growing between More and his friends. It does a great job in showing how one man's integrity can be very powerful and even though the King did marry someone else and divorce his wife, he did it without Mores' granting. The story is very well chronicled in the movie and the acting is well done, as for its entertainment value it is very long and has little humor or action in it. The film is more of a documentary than an entertaining story. The viewers will receive more from the power of Mores' words than anything else. The film is very believable and is a great ethical teacher; all of Mores' actions in the film portray someone who is willing to stand up to anything so that he will not have to stand on his beliefs.",

It's an interesting question, especially as a Christian myself, if I would stand and die on the same hill as More.

            "content": "(a \"nonhistory and nonintellectual\" film review by Timothy J. Verret)\n\nLet me just start off by saying I do NOT like history and I am NOT an intellectual. I don't know what it is about history that makes me just want to snore. I'm intelligent, for the most part, but sometimes intellectualism can feel very inauthentic to me and take away from what I like to call \"heart work.\" I like to approach what I create from a place of deeper human and spiritual truths, a place where it's not mind over matter but rather heart over matter, and a place where if history is to repeat itself, it is to repeat itself for the present\u2026.for the now. This is where I plan to go with this \"nonhistory and nonintellectual\" film review of A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS (1966).\n\nA MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, a film based off of Robert Bolt's play of the same name, received the Academy Award for Best Picture and also won numerous other awards including Paul Scofield for Best Actor and, given this was a period piece, multiple Oscar wins in the costume and art direction categories. The biographical film details the life of Sir Thomas More, the 16th-century Lord Chancellor of England, at a time when he refused to sign a letter to annul Henry VIII's marriage to Catherine. This also led to More's refusal to take an oath of supremacy to declare Henry VIII Supreme Head of the Church of England. Why did More refuse to do these things? Simple. More was a man of conviction, a man of the Bible, and a man who stood by what aligned with this conviction and the Bible. He would not sway one inch if anything he said or did contradicted the Bible, not one inch if Savior Jesus Christ wouldn't say or do the same thing, and not one inch to rest on his laurels, for More had no laurels unless they were aligned with God and Jesus. More saw good and decency in all and never expressed an unkind word. When he did express words, boy did he ever express them with conviction! But these words were never more than were necessary and maybe that is how More lived up to his name, i.e., More never spoke \"more\" words than what were just enough. But words aside, it was More's \"silence\" that led to his beheading. I could go on and on about how \"silence\" is played out (and played, for the most part, quietly) in A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, but I cannot be silent about this film being incredibly scrumptious in look while at the same time rich in emotions. It's a marvel of cinema as we watch the man More never marvel himself in any and all seasons. Ironically, this man More is exactly the man we need right now in the season we are in. This is where history can repeat itself. We can bring a kind man of conviction from history into the present, and Sir Thomas More is exactly the kind of man we need to bring into the present\u2026.the now!\n\nI got introduced to British actor Paul Scofield when I saw him in a theatre production of Edward Albee's A DELICATE BALANCE. In this film adaptation of the play, Scofield as Tobias was a force to be reckoned with. Going toe to toe with actress Katherine Hepburn on screen is not an easy feat for any actor, but Scofield did go toe to toe with Hepburn (in fact, stepped on her toes more than once). Scofield commands your attention when he is on screen. It was only after much research that I discovered Paul Scofield was quite famous in England for his roles in Shakespearean plays. No surprise here, as those trained in the theatre and especially trained in Shakespeare practically break the film camera with their intensity. It might be because they have to be \"big\" on stage that this same \"bigness\" leaves the film camera helpless to contain their energy. I recently saw Paul Scofield again in Arthur Miller's THE CRUCIBLE, another play turned into a film, and Scofield stole every scene he was in. There are some actors who when they act, the rest of the cast, not to discredit their talents, become \"furniture.\" Scofield is an actor who when he is on screen (I would have killed to see him onstage), he commands your attention and you feel downright guilty if you want to look at the other actors or dare turn away from Scofield. All this to say that Paul Scofield's performance as Sir Thomas More in A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS is captivating, commanding, and convincing. He embodies More with a calm control, and what I noticed in Scofield's characterization is that when anyone addresses him in the film, he does a full 180-degree turn to face them. Because Scofield adds this demonstrative touch to More, all the characters in this film who call on him get his demonstrative attention. It's kind of like that someone who makes you feel you are the most important person on the planet when you are in their presence. This touch and attention is what Scofield brought to Sir Thomas More in A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS.\n\nThe rest of the cast of A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, the direction, the music, all of it is sheer brilliance. And just to tell you how brilliant this film is, another Edward Albee play turned into a film, WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?, was nominated for Best Picture the same year as A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS and Richard Burton as George in the same Best Actor category as Paul Scofield. WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? is #6 on my all-time favorite film list. I shudder to think if I would have been on the Oscar Voting Committee that year. A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS and WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? where one is the Best Picture winner? I would have been, \"Sorry, dudes. I'm playing the \u2018More card.' I will remain silent and not sign any oath to choose one of these films over the other!\" And don't get me started on having to choose the Best Actor of 1966: Richard Burton in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? or Paul Scofield in A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS? But if I'm being honest, I would have chosen Paul Scofield. Scofield is THAT amazing! As a side note, maybe that's why the Oscars changed the announcement of wins from \"and the winner is\u2026.\" to \"and the Oscar goes to\u2026.\" It really is so ego-driven to choose one film over another or one performance over another; they are ALL winners!\n\nWell, that's my \"nonhistory and nonintellectual\" film review of A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS. If I got you to want to watch the film for history's sake, I failed. If I got you to want to watch the film for intellectual's sake, I failed, But if I got you to want to watch A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS because of Sir Thomas More's moral and Biblical conviction in the face of adversaries and adversity, something and someone so needed now, or if I got you to want to watch the film because of Paul Scofield's not-to-be-missed Oscar-winning performance as Sir Thomas More, then I have garnered a success in writing this film review!",

This films deals with how he treated religious figures and even betrayed ppl in his own court in the end. How he treated Thomas More was deplorable. I would have appreciated the film to have more going on than just talking and trials, but it stuck to its principles like Thomas. It showed how important fair trials are and our justice system today compared to the days of kings. I still see similiarities btw the bad guys then and bad guys now-being bullies/using intimidation, the one who is kinda good/but still bad, the layperson just \"carrying out their job\" and the  practice of following/recording ppl like in some societies today.

As a result, More resigns as Lord Chancellor, is tried for treason, and is beheaded. Writer Robert Bolt, who also penned the play, used the title from a quote from More's advisor Robert Whittington to describe him. Whittington said that while he barely knew the man, he said he was serious, witty and moral all at once. How does Fred Zinnemann show Whittington's thoughts on More in the movie? First, the intelligence comes from More's knowledge and passion for Catholicism and the laws of the day. Secondly, His humour sprays as sharp and dry, like when he insults Cromwell, comparing him to a \"dockside bully\" or complimenting on Alice's custards during his last meal. Lastly, More's moral instinct serves as less a human trait than a medal given to him. Thus, by giving up his medal of morality, he legally gives up his life to the good hands of the church. A Man for All Seasons writes to reflect on a progressive downfall of a 16th Century historical religious figure and a study on human behavior. \n\n(4 Gargoyle Statues out of 5)",

Robert Shaw as the kings is sometimes a little crazy with his laughing at most things and his extravagance but impresses in communication with Scofield. It contains a sold supporting cast and the script may confuse some especially in the trial. The costumes and locations of the movie are deserve praise including many scenes down the river. Nothing seemed out of place or time. A film about your morals and conscience may bore people and some scenes were less interesting than others. The trial was a great scene with the camera panning down the crowd if they react and Leo McKern as an angry Thomas Cromwell with the crowd acknowledging elements of Sir Thomas but still disappointing that he doesn't back the king. The second half of the film is more interesting than the first as we see the struggle Sir Thomas has and how it will effect his family and friends. We also see how many characters have no morals as they strive to improve their situations walking over anyone they can. A decent movie with a great lead performances only let down by a slower first half than a more interesting second.",

            "content": "Fred Zinnemann's A Man for All Seasons, despite being directed by an Austrian-born American more famous for such films as High Noon and From Here to Eternity, is quintessentially British. Adapted for the screen by Robert Bolt from his play of the same name, it's a biographical period drama focusing on the life and death of sixteenth century Lord Chancellor of England Sir Thomas More, and although that doesn't sound particularly gripping the result is thoroughly absorbing.\nThe story basically concerns More's refusal to swear an oath to the effect that Henry VIII's marriage to Catherine of Aragon was unlawful, an oath demanded by the King so that he could marry Anne Boelyn instead. More refuses on the grounds of conscience and eventually gets sentenced to execution for high treason. This basically true story arises out of the minutiae of sixteenth century English politics and religion, and on paper it sounds as dull as ditchwater. It works for two main reasons, one of which is the Bolt's screenplay, the other of which is the acting.\nA Man for All Seasons shows its theatrical roots: Bolt's script is positively Shakespearean and is eminently quotable (\"I trust I make myself obscure?\" is just one of many wonderful lines). The script mostly consists of men debating points of principle and law. The dialogue is a gift for the actors: the cast is crammed with the best of British talent from the era (plus Orson Welles), most of them with classical theatre training. The producers reportedly wanted a higher profile actor than Paul Scofield to play More, but Zinnemann insisted that Scofield be allowed to reprise his stage role for the screen and it's now unthinkable to imagine anybody else in the part. He brings dignity and gravitas to More and every moment of his performance is captivating.\nHe isn't the only one: Leo McKern is wonderfully devious as the scheming and increasingly angry Thomas Cromwell, as is Nigel Davenport as More's friend Norfolk who is ultimately powerless to avert More's fate. Robert Shaw almost steals the show during his few short scenes as Henry VIII, capturing the man's mixture of charisma, arrogance, petulance, and short-temper perfectly. Wendy Hiller's Alice More makes a fitting foil for her husband, often countering his passionate moral stance with simple common sense, and the actress makes her love for her husband utterly believable. John Hurt is also convincing in an early film role as turncoat Richard Rich.\nRealising that his actors are the film's strength, Zinneman allows them to deliver performances that wouldn't be out of place in a theatre production, but which are perfectly suited to the script. He doesn't however deliver a film that looks as though it were filmed on a stage set, instead crafting an impressively mounted period peace with impeccable detail paid to the sets, costumes and props, and bolstered by some gorgeous location filming. The final shot of the executioner's axe descending towards More's neck before the film fades to black and a terse voice-over reveals the grim fates of most the film's other main characters provides a dramatic final punch. The mise-en-sc\u00e8ne creates an illusion of sixteenth century England that is totally convincing, as does Georges Delerue's classical soundtrack.\nA Man for All Seasons is a great film. If it seems surprising that a British-made period drama won the 1966 Academy Award for Best Film, it shouldn't be: this is a master class in script-writing and screen acting and \u2013 in Zinnemann's handling of his material, cast and crew \u2013 directing.",

            "content": "While it might suffer from a deliberate pace and lack of urgency, A Man For All Seasons is still a compelling drama that rests largely on the shoulders of Paul Scofield, one of the UK's most renowned actors. His depiction of Thomas More is, from what I've read, very close to real life: A man of solid conviction, unwavering in matters of moral integrity and unwilling to compromise his character, even at the expense of his life. People who like films with actions as well as words will be disappointed, as the films stage origins are clear. But the dialogue is well written and delivered, and the movie features some larger than life performances, especially from Robert Shaw as the 2 opposing personalities of Henry VIII, at times flamboyant and charming, at others foul tempered and determined. He makes for an entertaining counterpart to the stoic Scofield, and I wish the film contained more interactions between them. It's a film that will have more appeal to those interested and/or acquainted with the time period in question, and while I can't see myself rushing to watch it again, it was an enjoyable 2 hours which simply flew by.",

            "content": "Religious films will always be a difficult watch for me because I am firmly an atheist but I tried to go into this film with an open mind and found myself feeling as much anger and confusion as I expected to. Beyond my issues with the ideas that the film supports I would also call it a tremendous bore that features uneven performances and cheap set dressing. Getting youths to sit down and watch this today would be incredibly difficult and I think that even adults would be nodding off as Paul Scofield delivers a self righteous monologue.\n\nThomas More, Paul Scofield, is the Lord Chancellor of England during the reign of King Henry VIII, Robert Shaw, but his refusal to accept the King's divorce from Catherine of Aragon causes him to face persecution. He remains strong in his convictions even as pressure piles on from those around him including his wife Alice, Wendy Miller, and fickle son in law William Roper, Corin Redgrave. His humiliated former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Richard Rich, John Hurt, sides with his enemies as the King desperately tries to pressure More into attending his wedding. More is eventually executed despite having no corroborated charges laid against him and re-states his allegiance to God over the King as he dies.\n\nThroughout More was a completely unsympathetic lead character as he makes idiotic decisions that threaten his life and that of those close to him based upon ideas that can't be proven. He speaks dismissively to those who care about him and sees his own ideals as being more important than the very real problems of those around him. His treatment of Rich and his son in law is seen as just because he is seen as always being right by the film as it seems to tell us that you must adopt one view and keep it forever or you are a person with no integrity. In my opinion people should make practical decisions in times of great upheaval and accept that those we care about are allowed to explore several different points of view before settling on one.\n\nThe performances left me cold as the two actors who gave subtle performances, Scofield and Hurt, played thoroughly dislikable and dull characters and the characters who should have lit up the screen were played by actors who still thought they were on the stage. I am shocked and horrified by the fact that Robert Shaw received an Academy Award nomination for his abominable performance as King Henry VIII. In a time period in which Henry Fonda and James Mason were giving subtle, layered performances in prestige films like this it was a slap in the face to see a bad theatre performance on the big screen and all of Shaw's actions and delivery of his lines seemed hammy and over the top especially when contrasted with Scofield. I would have given Best Actor to Michael Caine for Alfie (1966) because the year's nominees were not particularly strong and he is likable and charming giving a career-defining performance.\n\nThe film's pacing was odd as when you have a character with no development and he's opposing a historical figure famed for murdering people at the drop of a hat it's hard to build any real tension. I knew that he was going to die from the moment he opposed the King's decision and I was only annoyed by his antics in the lead up to his beheading, I was almost glad that it occurred because it shut him up for once. Even Braveheart (1995) managed to pull off a better death scene than this film and that's saying something.\n\nThe 1966 Best Picture nominees are pretty weak as only Alfie really appeals to me because I don't like Elizabeth Taylor's performance in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966). This is definitely not Best Picture material despite a brief Vanessa Redgrave cameo and even it's light competition are definitely more engaging than it is. Watch The Apartment (1960), The Sound of Music (1965) or Oliver! (1968), I have not seen Lawrence of Arabia (1962) or Midnight Cowboy (1969) yet, if you want to see a good Best Picture winner from the 1960s.",

            "content": "A Man for All Seasons is a movie about Thomas More and his struggle to remain true to his beliefs despite opposition from everyone around him. For a movie that is largely made up of verbal debates, I found it riveting. The number of different government and church officials that confront and chastise Thomas More is daunting, but a one-man-vs.-the-multitude story is always exciting. You naturally get on the side of the underdog, and it helps that he seems to be the only one taking the moral high ground. Paul Scofield does an amazing job of portraying Thomas More as a strong character, who is gradually beaten down by his trials. He gets a number of powerful speeches to deliver, and he does it so well that I can\u2019t imagine anyone doubting the truth of his statements, and he proves his Oscar for Best Actor was well deserved. I\u2019m not a big history buff, so much of this was new territory to me. I knew select details, but it was like seeing a whole new story unfold. I thought it was awesome when it became a legal battle, because I like any kind of court trial in film. It was even more interesting since Thomas More knew the ins-and-outs of the system so he could live in the loopholes to outsmart his detractors. I had a few moments where I struggled to follow what was happening in certain conversations, but I never felt like the movie was dragging. It seemed that every scene had a reason to exist, and even mundane tasks like More hiring a boat to take him home had relevance. This is the kind of film that dramatizes a historical event so well that I walk away with a desire to read more about the actual history. Not only did I love A Man for All Seasons, it\u2019s the kind of film I expect could become a favorite when I watch it again someday.",

His current wife, Catherine of Aragon, seems unable to bear him a son and heir and he's besotted with Ann Boleyn.  He wants to divorce Catherine but, other than the Pope, the main impediment is Sir Thomas More, a pre-eminent legal authority and devout Christian.  More is eventually made Lord Chancellor, one of the highest positions in government.  He resigns this position out of protest against the King's plans to go ahead with the divorce.  Surely, now that he is out of government and out of the limelight, as long as he doesn't air his views, his principles aren't a threat to the King's plans and he is safe from prosecution?\n\nDirected by Fred Zinneman (High Noon, From Here to Eternity, The Search) a wonderfully lavish production.

Like Ben Kingsley as Ghandi, the role of Thomas More would define Paul Scofield, who won the Best Actor Oscar over Richard Burton in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" Scofield had internalized the role, but Burton lived his, and acted circles around Scofield. But Hollywood prefers to honor heroes and martyrs over deeply flawed individuals. Oscar's snubbing of director Mike Nichols and Richard Burton showed that Hollywood could not handle the Truth. Robert Bolt's screenplay may stand as a flawless morality play, but it's still Golden Age Hollywood, with real emotions buried under Victorian manners and layers of costuming.

It won the academy award for Best Picture of 1966, and it co- stars famous actors Orson Welles, Robert Shaw, and John Hurt. The strongest aspects of this film are the writing and performances; combined, these two elements form a great movie.\n\nNot mentioned above, Paul Scofield, who I have never heard of prior to seeing this film, carries this film with a brilliant performance. He plays Thomas More, a man defiant to man's law if God's law says differently. This is the essence of his personality, and he is a character who is full of wisdom and a great sense of logic in order to defend himself against the accusations of the corrupt. While his wisdom and logic do not ultimately save him, these characteristics form one of the most inspirational characters I have ever seen on film. Scofield plays More as a man who calmly accepts his fate while standing by his words and beliefs, rather than pleading his allegiance to the corruption within England's government.\n\nThe supporting cast - especially John Hurt - do a good job of building up More even more (pun not intended) by portraying corrupt individuals who More has tried to help. More always has the best intentions; John Hurt's character is looking for employment at the beginning of the film, and More tries to convince him to become a teacher to avoid the corruption of government, and offers him a bribe he has received in order to get the man started. At first it seems possible that Hurt's character will remain loyal to More, but instead uses the fact that he was \"bribed\" by More to obtain a post within the government. It is heartbreaking to listen to Hurt's character lie about More late in the film in order to just keep climbing up the ladder, a situation More was trying to prevent entirely for the best intentions.\n\nMost of the film consists of inspiring monologues through More, an aspect I love since I think monologues are difficult to pull off correctly and are extremely effective in developing character. Scofield does it with mastery. I think it makes sense that this work stems from a play because I see it more fitting to be performed on stage than I see it as a cinematic work. If the film was more cinematic I would give it a perfect rating, but to me the only really visually captivating scene in the film was the penultimate scene: the trial for More's life. As my uncle says, in a way, this film makes you \"want to be a better person.\"",

Our response to it should be exactly as Scofield portrays in this film, as upholding our own life as the example and defense of human dignity. In my opinion Scofield and Zinnemann have recaptured the timeless values that we take for granted in the life of this saint.

            "content": "This sounds like some kind of a cheesy commercial trying to sell a man for any occasion, though probably mostly for labor. Ladies, if that grass has to be cut in the spring, or if you need leaves cleaned out of the gutter in fall, or if you need the Christmas tree put up in winter, or if you simply want to be served a cold drink on a hot summer day, then you need a man for all seasons! Man, speaking of diverse men, Fred Zinnemann has done noirs, westerns as big as \"High Noon\", war films as intimate as \"From Here to Eternity\", and even \"Oklahoma!\", but now he takes on his greatest challenge: portraying devout Catholicism, even though he's such a Jew that he moved from Austria to Hollywood. I think I'm more baffled by how British he, as an Austro-American, made this film, because the only American he has in this film is Orson Welles, the most British man in Hollywood. Welles was so awesome that I think that they should have given him a spin-off, like \"A Cardinal for All Seasons\", or, better yet, \"A Cardinal's Story\". Zinnemann would have be involved in that film, because the filmmakers would be sued hard enough by the guys who made \"The Cardinal\" without the obvious consent of the dude who made \"A Nun's Story\". If it was to be as long as either \"The Cardinal\" or \"A Nun's Story\", then I would hope that it would be more exciting than this film, which is reasonably engaging, but not especially momentous, and definitely not all that original.\r\n\r\nThe film is widely recognized for its freshness and impact on storytelling sensibilities in period dramas of its type, so, of course, what unique attributes there are prove to be notable and important, but they're limited, because in a lot of ways, this is a rather formulaic period drama which draws familiar characters and plotting tropes which come with their traditional shortage in subtlety. Among the impacting attributes of this film is its not being all that melodramatic, so much so that its story takes from a true tale, although this tale is set in a romantic, and had to be interpreted into a play before it was made into this '60s drama, so there are certain theatrics in histrionics and somewhat stereotypical characterization which are hard to buy into, even in the context of this romantic period piece which stands to flesh out its depths to a more compelling extent. I've already noted that there are some histrionic tropes to the characterization of this weighty, but formal character piece, but the expository shortcomings go deeper than that in this well-acted and generally well-drawn melodrama which is short on the background development of each one of its many major roles, and stands to be more nuanced after a while. The film doesn't take as much time as it probably should to flesh out the depths of its characters and their distinguished roles in this narrative, although it does dedicate a good amount of time to excess in order to reach a runtime of two hours, or at least seems to, as it runs into a lot of minimalist material which gets to be repetitious, and perhaps would have been more aimless if it wasn't for a degree of predictability. This film takes its time to limp down an arguably overly intimate path, but along the way, it is backed up by many an intriguing strength which prove to be the makings of a truly rewarding film, so for the final product to not reward, that means that the big issue here is Fred Zinnemann's attempt at a dryly British directorial storytelling style whose frequent quietness leads to a coldness to the bite of the dramatic tone and tension, and, of course, bores. Yes, the film is kind of dull, not at times, but all but consistently, having enough strong aspects to border on engrossing through and through, but still trying your investment through conventions, melodramatics and developmental shortcomings, and your patience through questionable pacing to the story structuring and storytelling. The final product cannot transcend underwhelmingness, but it does come close enough to meet all challenges to your investment with compelling traits that shine a light on the potential of this drama.\r\n\r\nA melodramatization of the legal and spiritual angles, and the controversies surrounding Henry VIII's seeking annulment, this story is politically, legally, religiously and even humanly charged, being intimate to the point of minimalism, but layered in its focusing on most all sides of this legendary story of a long-ago time whose convincingness is, of course, important in this drama. Terence Marsh's art direction, backed by production designer John Box and costume designer... whoever, goes well above and beyond the call of duty when it comes to restoring 16th-century England, not simply crafting designs which are convincing to begin with, but lavishly distinguishing them as good-looking in their intricacies, whose handsomeness is augmented by cinematography by Ted Moore which carries a rugged bleakness to capture a sense of grit to this subtly intense affair. I don't suppose the aesthetic integrity of this sophisticated, but light film is especially glowing, but there's so much taste in the overall craft of this handsome, immersive period drama, and it wouldn't be so effective if there wasn't taste to the manipulation of the style through direction. Director Fred Zinnemann manages to orchestra style with such delicacy because he approaches this film with a consistent thoughtfulness, and all too often, it is not justified in this already conceptually dry and steady drama, thus, the film falls to dullness, but not beneath respectability through a subtle, sophisticated atmosphere that holds a certain immediate intrigue, expanded upon by Zinnemann's finding material through which to deliver biting dramatic highlights. Robert Bolt's script is sure to provide some solid material for Zinnemann to work with, though far from consistently, hitting some tropes and overt histrionics while it drags along with repetitious plotting aspects, but aiding in securing some degree of engagement value through sharp, often outstanding dialogue of great wit, and through an audacious, often surprisingly tight exploration of thematically dynamic and consistently intimate narrative branches. Of course, the intimacy of this ensemble character drama truly thrives on the underwritten performances of talents so great that they transcend characterization thinness and deliver, whether it be the briefly present Orson Welles as an old and wise, yet trouble cardinal, or Robert Shaw as a flamboyant and problematic king, or John Hurt as a chancellor faced with a questionable case he might not be able to easily dismiss, or the primarily focused upon Paul Scofield as a hero of faith, respectability and tragedy whose worthy stances may only lead him deeper into trouble. These are but a few members in a cast full of solid performances, and although no one is truly great, the acting plays an instrumental part in driving this film to the brink of rewarding, helped greatly by sharp style and sophisticated, if questionable storytelling.\r\n\r\nOnce the seasons have come and gone, conventional and melodramatic attributes shake intrigue about as much as questionably structured expository depths, despite all of the repetitious dragging that is made all the more glaring by a cold - nay - dull thoughtfulness which secures the final product as underwhelming, but just barely, for conceptual intrigue, handsomely immersive art direction and cinematography, tasteful direction, sophisticated scripting, and across-the-board strong performances prove to be enough to make Fred Zinnemann's \"A Man of All Seasons\" an intriguing, if challenging period melodrama.\r\n\r\n2.75/5 - Decent",

            "content": "Okay this is the third to last best picture winner from the 60's.\n\nPlot: The film surrounds around Sir Thomas More back around the time of Kind Henry VIII in England. It begins with Cardinal Wolsey asking him to support his attempt in helping Henry VIII obtain a divorce from Catherine of Aragon, but More refuses. As a result, the council and even Henry VIII himself try to convince him to give his support. Meanwhile a young acquaintance of his named Richard Rich tries to think of ways to bring him down along with Thomas Cromwell.\n\nThis was just a nice movie for me honestly. As far as story goes, it's definitely nice because I do like the general tale about Henry VIII and his wives, which is what I particularly enjoyed a lot about the movie Anne of A Thousand Days. So naturally, a movie that has a little bit to do with that part of history would be interesting. And to an extent, it was. I'm pretty sure I never really even heard of Sir Thomas More from either when my mother would play this book on CD about Henry VIII or when I was studying about Europe in my history class during my senior year in high school. So it was a little nice to learn a little something from during the time between Henry VIII was working on divorcing Catherine of Aragon and a little after he married Anne Boleyn. But that doesn't necessarily mean I completely enjoyed the movie with little to no doubt whatsoever. Because putting all of that aside, I thought it was just an okay movie. It's wasn't that big of a film as far as an adaption from a play or otherwise, and not a lot of characters really stood out - except for Robert Shaw as Henry VIII who gave a performance that was good but a little different from how I interpret the person, especially when it came to his laugh which made me think more of Robin Hood from The Adventures of Robin Hood back in 1938. Also I will admit that the choice of cast was very interesting with having actors like Orson Welles and John Hurt.\n\n\nAnd that's my review for A Man of all Seasons. It's nothing special to me as a film, but it did still give a story that's set around the time of Henry VIII that makes it interesting enough to be a decent film to watch at the very least.",

It's probably one of those stories (like Anna Karenina) that it's interesting to view at different stages of your life.  So, now as a mature woman, I saw the story as that of a man who is steadfast in his refusal to change while the winds of change blow him off his pedestal.  I saw loyalty to a corrupt church:  but as he says, the Catholic church was the only one with a pedigree from JC.  His son-in-law was adamant that he destroy everything corrupt, not realising as I do with the advantage of advanced years hahaha, that man is corrupt and killing a few doesn't change corruption, it just changes the names of the people in charge.  The final question is what are you willing to die for, remembering of course that the life span was a lot shorter then.  The questions the story of Thomas Moore raises are complex and the answers not easily apparent and I think it might be good for youngins to view it as a way into the complex ideas of life now--nothing is black and white.",

            "content": "A Man for All Seasons is, for the most part, a film that has withstood the test of time. Based on the play of the same name by Robert Bolt, it tackles a very high concept and complex subject matter, dealing with the inner workings of the formation of the Church of England by King Henry VIII during the 15th century, and one man's opposition to the motive. For the most part, director Fred Zinnemann successfully executes, crafting a film drenched in drama. The story of Thomas More is a deep and intricate tale, as his opposition to Henry's divorce and remarriage outside of church law makes him the only true honest man in the court, while also painting a huge target on his back. And Thomas More is brought to life in the career-defining performance from Paul Scofield, earning his Oscar and the Best Picture award almost singlehandedly. Not to say that the rest of the cast is any less impressive, though. Robert Shaw shines as King Henry, making him appear a man of erratic changes in emotion who desperately seeks moral approval for his actions. Leo McKern also gives a memorable turn as the corrupt Cromwell, who is the film's most identifiable villain. Strong supporting jobs are given from the renowned Orson Welles, a young John Hurt, Wendy Hiller, and Susannah York. The one weakness of the film is that the story struggles to transition from its turning point to its final act, dragging in the middle and potentially boring some viewers. Nevertheless, A Man for All Seasons is worthy of its Oscar, based solely on Scofield and the depth and gravity of its themes.",

This is a historical drama (which the Academy loves), so it makes sense also that this won some of the Big Awards, including Best Picture. \n\nI do love historicla movies, but this is one of those cases where a film that's feverishly historically accurate doesn't always mean it's going to be an enjoyable one...at least not for those looking for something with mainstream appeal and accessibility. \n\nThere's basically no action, and it's almost entirely a philosophical discussion/character study about two vastly dfifferent men with extremely clashing views/personalities. I dug it for the most part, but admittedly did find it hard to sit through and kinda boring here and there. \n\nStill though, you gotta give a lot of credit to it for the stellar cinematography, art direction, set design, and costumes. The attention to period details and historical accuracy are also to be appluaded, but it probably couldn't have hurt to put in some more action or somehting just to liven things up on occasion.\n\nThe direction is okay, but Zinnemann has done far better work. The writing is quite sharp and really nails the characters and subject matter, but what really sells the film are the performances. Paul Scofield reprises his role from the play, and rightfully earned an Oscar for his superb work. Robvert Shaw was awesome as Henry VIII, and he's definitely an actor worth checking out if all you know of him is his brilliant work in Jaws. Other notables in the cast invlude Vanessa Redgrave as Anne Boleyn, John Hurt as Richasrd RIch, and Orson Welles, whose turn as Cardinal Wolsey is terrific just ofr the sheer fact that it's cool to see him rocking the always photogenic Cardinal robes. \n\nThis is a hard film to get into, and more for the patient intellectuals than those who like action oriented history based works, but it's got some great themes and materia lworth discussing, so all in all, it's a fine film, but not one I would necessarily say is totally deserving of Best Picture.",

Yet, political disgrace still means death and Sir Thomas More, outnumbered by political foes and men who bend to the king's will to remarry, stands alone.

When a King could order a severed head on a whim and his subjects grovelled like loyal puppies keen for a feed? Ah yes, how times have changed.\r\n\r\nA Man For All Seasons is not about King Henry the VIII (Robert Shaw). Not really. It's about a man of principals, a man of faith, Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield). The King is a mad man on a mission to grab as much power as he can. He has cast himself as God, religion-maker, rule changer. With an 'off-with-their-heads' attitude, the King demands that the English embrace a new church, simply so he can divorce  Queen Catherine and marry Anne Boleyn (Vanessa Redgrave).\r\n\r\nMore is a strict Catholic kinda man, loyal to the Pope and not to the King. He knows that this will cause him strife but he's determined to stick to his principles, at least in his own mind. Spies, power struggles and the word 'traitor' is flung about willy-nilly and many heads find themselves rolling around on the gritty floor.\r\n\r\nFor those who cannot handle historical films, this may be well worth a look. Instead of being bogged down in details, this film takes you on a journey through the mucky world of 16th Century England. Unlike today where politicians are happy to air their dirty laundry in our faces, in Henry VIII's world, opinions were suppressed. For good reason too. Henry wasn't out to be King of the year but to simply do whatever he wanted. In the end... well you'll have to watch it, but in the end the King pays the price for heresy and selfishness. Long live the King! Or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n'A Man For All Seasons' Trivia:\r\n\r\n* Budget - $3,900,000\r\n* Styrofoam was ordered to create the snowy scenes but as they arrived the real stuff came sprinkling down.\r\n* Vanessa Redgrave wouldn't accept payment for her role.\r\n* Imagine if the film had Laurence Olivier as Sir Thomas and Alec Guinness as Wolsey... as the producers wanted. But Director Fred Zinnemann got his way and his men.\r\n* This film is based on a play by Robert Bolt starring Paul Scofield and Leo McKern.\r\n* The filming took a mere 12 weeks.\r\n* Thomas was the first name of 5 of the main people the play was based on. Bolt only kept 2 the same.",

But because I love history and old films, I was really drawn into this film, invested in the characters and I cared about what happened to these people.

Though frowned upon, no one would argue with the will of the King's, so all the leads of the Church of England obeyed King Henry's will. Except for one. Thomas More was the only man standing in the King's way from geting a devorce approval from the Pope. This is a very interesting true story about one man vs. society, what others deem right and wrong, whether orders should be obeyed, (especially if it's from the freaken king!) and staying true to one's beliefs.\r\n\r\nFred Zinnermann (High Noon, From Here to Eternity) was definitely not worried about making an appealing movie. The lack of diagetic music sets a very depressing mood though the whole movie, and there's not a lot to be attracted to. Although, the sets and costumes are stunningly detailed to historical portrayal. This movie also has some great thought into the cinematography, in which all other rooms in the movie are dark, but in Thomas More's house daylight is always present. There's no romanticised features in this movie, but by observing them closely, there is lots to be impressed with in this movie.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, this is a pretty dull movie. It's slow and characters are generally unappealing, facing subject matter only attractive as a history lesson. It's a movie about going against the King, so there isn't a lot of relevance for today's society. But then again I think the point of the movie is that it's not supposed to be relevant or appealing. The fact that no one likes what More is doing sets a very destinct character, and what he stands for isn't about his Christian beliefs but that the order of the King is no greater nor more right than a fool's belief. It's not the most entertaining movie, but its a full hearted lession teacher that great actors and great writing bring out.",

With a film like this, one can even predict halfway through that this would certainly climax in a trial scene(and I was certainly right), with the actor portraying the protagonist uttering some 3-page long oration. But I was quite surprised at how Paul Scofield has done that particular scene. He has portrayed Thomas More as a worn-out individual, and though capable of answering and speaking, chooses not to do much. Instead of a sprawling speech that I have expected, I have witnessed a very brief one, but with a power never much diminished by its shortness. Apart from it being a showcase of some very fine acting, \"A Man for all Seasons\" has also showed the \"not-so-likable\" side of 16th century England, perfectly countered with a very moving story of unconditional martyrdom.",

            "content": "\"A Man for All Seasons\" was the big winner at the 1966's Oscars. It won 6, Picture, Actor (Paul Scofield), director (Fred Zinnemann, who had also won the double film/director in 1953 with \"From Here to Eternity\"), writing, costume design and cinematography. Looking at other contenders of that year, it appears as no surprise, even if the movie was worse than it was. This is much more a movie of ideas and ideals than a movie of action, its acting is presented as the most powerful feature, and there is a certain delicacy in the dialogues. Based on the stage play of the same name (which also won the Tony for Best Play and Actor for Scofield), it tells of the last years of Sir Thomas Moore's life, after he fails to recognize King Henry VIII's right to marry Ann Boleyn and the institution of the church of England. A philosopher and a great thinker, Moore never gives in to pressures, and very wittingly holds his ground until he is arrested and ultimately tried for high treason. Zinemman gives some continuity to the scenes notably taken straight from the play by introducing some transitions, some changing in settings and one or two amusing details (such as the court following the king around). But he is very unobtrusive in his directing, leaving the actors to give the essence to the picture, but also taking exquisite account of the detail, the clothes, the accessories, the buildings and the art of the 16th century. Scofield is superb as Moore, giving him an almost zen-like quality in his soft voice, which only fails him at the end. Ever the righteous man, ever the utopianist, but also very human in his convictions. His greatest adversary, Cromwell, the man who tries him, is played by bulldog-like Leo McKern, a menacing presence. Other supporting cast include Robert Shaw as the king, playing him as an joyous fellow without much interest in affairs except his own, John Hurt in his first role as the man who sells Moore out, Wendy Hiller, always the icy emotional lady as Moore's wife and notably Orson Wells, in one single scene at the beginning, powerful off course, completely in command, a presence that stays with you until the end. The movie gains by Moore's way of being, never being portrait as a martyr but as a man of convictions, a visionary ahead of its time, and a Christian to the full sense of the word. If the real man had any doubts... well, one assumes that he may have had, but the movie carefully avoids that. He is portrayed as immaculate, but that doesn't take the power of the moral the movie presents, neither of the fascination of the main character, who never does anything fancy nor challenging, except to talk. Fantastic screenplay which moves the movie and never makes it dull, whose heart is Paul Scoffield's performance, and which has great details of the epoch. To know the legend of Thomas Moore, and also to give a moral about fighting for your convictions till the end. Ultimately, it is about the power of the word that makes the law. Are laws just words or are they something more? A scholar movie which can have many parallels in current affairs.",

It focuses on Thomas More (Paul Scofield) who is caught in a struggle with Henry VIII (Robert Shaw), who wishes to divorce Catherine of Aragon, and marry Anne Boleyn instead. Cardinal Wolsey (Orson Welles) wants the Pope to grant them a divorce, and he needs More's help, but More being a devout Catholic refuses. More is made Lord Chancellor of England by Henry, but one comment regarding Henry is picked up by Thomas Cromwell (Leo McKern), who uses one of More's old acquantances from Cambridge, Richard Rich (John Hurt) to spy on More and his family. It's a fairly straight forward story, and to the point as well. It's beautifully shot by Ted Moore, and Georges Delerue's traditional score is good on the ear, but it's Scofield's restrained, down to earth, human role as More which makes the film all the more engaging.

Overall, I found this terrible. The king wants a divorce and he'll of course get it. They keep threatening to try the main character for treason if he doesn't take his oath and he keeps saying go ahead. They finally do try him, he is found guilty, and executed. The film has Orson Welles in it (he did not direct) so I was hoping that would make for a good film, but his role was small and nothing particularly exciting.

If you don't like a film that is primarily composed of talking, this film isn't for you, but be warned you are missing out.  This is a showcase for great British performance, and also represents a prominent moment in the history of England.  Despite these elements composing the bulk of the film, Zinnemann still proves he is a skilled director, as the cinematography is beautiful and the color is more striking than I expected from a film from 1966.  Something about it feels very fresh, but not so fresh that the period setting doesn't feel unauthentic.  The film still works 40 years later, which is reason enough to warrant merit, but it is also a terrific religious film for the those of the faith, as it doesn't feel preachy but echoes a powerful message.",

            "content": "\"'A Man for All Seasons' is a picture that inspires admiration, courage and thought.\" - New York Times \r\n\r\nThis is a historic tale which centers around Sir Thomas More's conscientious plight not just against the king of England but with himself. Against an overwhelming tide More is bent on standing firm to his own convinctions despite the ramifications that come with opposing the wishes of the king... especially one as ruthless as Henry VIII. \r\n\r\nThe wryly principled \"man for all seasons\" is acted superbly by Paul Scofield as one who, although unwilling to compromise his valued morals, does share a mutual respect with the king (and we find King Henry does greatly admire and respect More, and is dismayed by his silence). Despite their affection for one another More is foremost a man unable by virtue to please the king at such a high expense as the wrongness of damning his own soul. This truly is an immaculate showcase of cinema shining through at its best, of the back-and-forths between such rich characters, no matter their relevance to the story... every character is important, drawn and fleshed out to More's dilemma and the central theme of having to keep one's person intact despite any temptations or opposition that would blemish it. \r\n\r\nAMFAS is known for its articulate and awe-inspiring dialogue and well-acted performances, it's also a very well-directed film from Fred Zinneman (who'd also made \"High Noon\" and \"From Here to Eternity\"; those pictures have nothing on this!) and flawlessly edited to where all scenes flow seemlessly together without one \"off\" moment or scene that feels misplaced. And on top of all this: AMFAS is breathlessly stunning as a visual piece to just gawk over. Its Academy wins for best cinematography and best costume design were understandably well-earned. \r\n\r\nThis picture is one of a slim few that does profoundly affect me to where I'll still reflect back on it long after any viewing. More's struggles and the way he handles them, how this true story gives us centuries and maybe even millenia of modeled character in action, how Sir Thomas More had in fact given his life to stand on his principle, and the great Paul Scofield's long-reaching performance as More is what all stays with me. Even his final words to onetime friend Richard is everlasting, wait for it! As a viewer who grows with concern it's difficult to watch More, with such grace and decency - pure dignity - succumbing to eventual harsh treatment and deprived from his wife and daughter. He's too good. Which brings me back to why \"A Man for All Seasons\" remains distinctly with me: how far would we go to protect what we see as the essence of ourselves, of keeping our souls intact when dealing with overwhelming and life-threatening adversity?",

The sets, costumes, music, and so forth are all of the highest quality for the 1960s. I can certainly see how this won Best Picture back then.
