Notes from meeting

Merge data (for each movie in set: data from all sources)

Problems might arise when merging
-Different encoding for diff characters and stuff

2 main packages for cleaning
- Stanza by Stanford
- spaCy

First step is always tokenizer
Then, different stuff in the pipeline
tagger (tags tokens) ->parser (builds dependency tree like structure)-> ner (detects and labels entities) -> lemmatizer (assigns base forms, eg don't - do not) -> 

Stanza vs spaCy (choose)
