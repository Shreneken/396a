  "summary": "In an unnamed Eastern city in 1929, the friendship between the local political boss (Finney) and Tom (Byrne), the man behind the man, is severed when they fall for same woman. Tom joins ranks with Johnny Caspar, Leo's enemy and rival, in a race for political power, resulting in a bloody, citywide gang war.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "As disturbing and densely beautiful as its opening image, a lofty forest that dwarfs the gangsters as they laugh over their kill.",
    "A masterpiece, but of a unique kind... A gorgeously filmed, supremely well-acted, intricately written film noir about now.",
    "Substance is here in spades, along with the twisted, brilliantly controlled style on which filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen made a name.",
    "Barry Sonnenfeld's stunning cinematography and the sharply etched characterizations make this film one for the ages.",
    "If, however, you're looking for compelling characters, all the lights are blazing here but nobody's at home.",
    "Crossing should be watched not because it's their finest achievement (that's still to come), but because the brothers are keeping things refreshingly different and building a career, their minds still very much fixed on originality.",
    "A very clever, stylish story of friendship, loyalty and betrayal.",
    "What it doesn't have is a narrative magnet to pull us through - a story line that makes us really care what happens, aside from the elegant but mechanical manipulations of the plot.",
    "It takes place in an artificial world constructed largely from the mythology of other movies, and, though it's both seamless and stylish, some find it a little too self-conscious for its own good.",
    "The double crosses are so intricate and the cynicism so enveloping that it becomes increasingly difficult to care about the characters",
    "Weightless. It is also, unfortunately, without much point at all... A movie of random effects and little accumulative impact."

The Cohen have the ability to go from one end to the other of this spectrum. The script runs during the Prohibition and in the context of an impending gangster war. Tom, the main character, is trying to avoid it, but ends up getting entangled in a web of crossed loyalties.Gabriel Byrne gave life to the lead role and was excellent. I loved his performance in a character who looks like an anti-hero. He has everything to be bad (he has no character or scruple and doesn't mind betraying friends) but he is pragmatic and seems to regard the bloodshed as something that should be avoided or minimized. That makes Tom a character we like. He is not a good guy, but he seems to be the most human person in the whole movie. Velma, on the other hand, looks like a cold, calculating, treacherous girl. The way Marcia Gay Harden acted also helped. The actress is good and performed well. John Turturro also shone in the role of Bernie, an opportunist little crook who gets in trouble by fooling a big fish. Albert Finney brought to life Leo, the powerful Irish boss with a good heart and full of kindness. He is a good actor, but his character seems too good to be a mobster. Much closer to the ruthless and cynical picture which we use to make of mob bosses is Jon Polito. He's the most dominant actor in the film, along with Byrne. I loved his work here. His cruelty, the easy way he kills or orders to kill gave me goose bumps. The rest of the cast also did a good job, but I think these actors deserve prominence, not so much for having the main characters but for the quality of their work.Another good thing are the technical details. Cinematography is very good and contributes decisively to the chilling environment that we like to feel in a true gangster movie. Some scenes are clearly homage to other films of the past, as well as the relevance given to fedora hats. In fact, if there is anything that we immediately link with the gangster world it's this particular type of hat (although it's also one of the most classic male hat models, still fashionable nowadays... I even have one). We can also see other iconic elements of the mob world, like Thompson sub-machine guns. It has excellent firefight scenes also, and the dry and ironic humor that is the Cohen Brothers trademark. The only thing I didn't like was the soundtrack because I felt it cut through the pleasant tension I felt throughout the movie.\"Miller's Crossing\" is a good movie. It's not too complex or unintelligible, tells a good story, has a nice irony, a good cast doing a great job, good production values and positive technical details. It's worth watching.",

The Coen brothers do style like nobody else. But I know this is going to sound like a platitude, but there is very little underneath all of it. For a thriller, Miller's Crossing achieves very little suspense for the audience and although Albert Finney, Jon Polito and John Turturro are game, Gabriel Byrne's mock New York accent is as glaringly awkward as the screenplay implausibilities are glaringly obvious. Why in God's name would Casper's henchman the Dane allow Tom to go out into the woods alone to shoot Bernie when the whole point of accompanying him to Miller's crossing was ascertain where Tom's loyalities laid?

Direction, characters, and dialogue are as measured as they are familiar and seem to be copying many gangster flicks that went before it. Take away the obviously slick scene set-ups and it’s just a shell that’s strung together in order to cram in as many killings, bashing, and double-crosses as three or four other movies just like it.  The movie's main character (Byrne) is somewhat like a cartoon character who gets knocked down several flights of stairs, bashed so badly (and often) that it’s amazing he can ever stand again but the next day he’s on the street looking fresh as a daisy. The only wound ever visibly inflicted is a cracked lip (that he’s had since the movie started!). It’s all reminiscent of a Sergio Lorne spaghetti western, the type these moviemakers would have grown up watching. Fans will not see the flaws through being blinded by the trendy stylistics but judging by the poor box-office returns, many others were not being so fooled. Carter Burwell’s score, adapted from a Celtic classic is most effective but deserves a better subject. The last scene, this time reminiscent of a far better Carol Reed classic, also features a Hat scene that looks like it belonged in a dark, Disney remake of the story of Johnny Fedora and Alice Blue Bonnet. A good cast wasted in more over the top nasty silliness.",
