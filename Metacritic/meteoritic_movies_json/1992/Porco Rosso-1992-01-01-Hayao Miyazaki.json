  "summary": "In 1930s Italy, a veteran World War I pilot is cursed to look like an anthropomorphic pig.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Animator/fabulist Hayao Miyazaki pays homage to Hollywood’s wartime adventure films in this masterwork built around the adventures of a high-flying pig.",
    "Not only does this rank among Miyazaki’s finest achievements, it reflects his personal love of aviation, his political concerns and his fullest expression to date of a non-fantasy world resembling our own.",
    "As usual with Miyazaki, the plot fits, starts and digresses at will, taking in the textures of pre-fascist Italy, details on the history of aviation and a lucid discussion on gender equality and physical beauty. Oh, and the kids will love it too.",
    "This homage to vintage Howard Hawks-style aerial thrills is as beautifully drawn and colored as anything he’s done. And it’s tremendous fun.",
    "It's in this view of the military life, and competition in general, that Porco Rosso reveals itself to be one of Miyazaki’s most personal works.",
    "Muting adult concerns — like the jackboots of fascism and the ubiquity of male violence — with marshmallow clouds and subtly shifting light, Mr. Miyazaki smooshes fantasy and history into a pastel-pretty yarn as irresistible as his feminism.",
    "Vastly entertaining, but like Porco aiming for the ethereal stream of planes above the clouds, never quite reaching its profound goals.",
    "Miyazaki never really explains why his aviator hero has been transformed into a pig (all the other characters are human), and the perfunctory climax fails to tie up any of the themes Miyazaki has developed. But this is masterful storytelling in every other respect, good-humored and frequently suspenseful, with a vivid setting.",
    "Porco Rosso was initially conceived as a short film for Japan Airlines, and its roots show in its delight with aviation and the experience of flight, but also in its somewhat shapeless plot.",
    "It's solid Miyazaki, although he has reached greater heights both before and since.",
    "The plot is hardly the point here - the animation is delightful, colourful and detailed and the flying sequences in seaplanes as old-fashioned as this style of animation are exhilarating."

Porco Rosso is the story of one man seeking redemption. While it maintains Miyazaki's beautiful art style, anti-war themes, and strong female characters, Porco Rosso centers on a middle-aged bounty-hunter protagonist who smokes, drinks, flirts, and flies his way through Fascist Italy in the 1930s.  Charming, poignant, funny, devastating, whimsical, and melancholy, Porco Rosso has something for everyone, and isn't afraid to take risks.You don't have to be a fan of anime to enjoy the works of Hayao Miyazaki, and this is one of his finest human dramas. Apart from the curse that turned our hero into a pig, all elements of fantasy that Miyazaki is known for are absent, and the world that this takes place in is very much our own.",
