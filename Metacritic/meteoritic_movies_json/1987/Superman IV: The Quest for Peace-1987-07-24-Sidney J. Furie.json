  "critic_reviews": [
    "As the hero, Christopher Reeve oozes with sincerity in the world-peace scenes - he helped write the story of the film, and this may be why he overdoes it. But he's also funny when he gets back to being klutzy Clark Kent, so the movie doesn't completely drown in its own good intentions.",
    "Threadbare as it's beginning to look, the Superman series hasn't lost its raison d'etre. There's life in the old boy yet.",
    "Director Sidney J. Furie, whose previous career high-point was either The Ipcress File or Lady Sings the Blues, fumbles the tone as badly as Richard Lester did in Superman III, veering drunkenly from action/adventure to comedy. Gone is the sense of naïve grandeur that made the original Superman such an endearing production.",
    "About as dreary as a summit conference in Belgium.",
    "So, to sum it up, Superman IV: The Quest For Peace is only slightly better than being trapped in a bear hug with Jan DeBont, and several steps below having an esoteric conversation with the Ghoulies.",
    "Superman IV is cinematic kryptonite. Not only could it kill the Superman series, it might also leave filmgoers feeling weak.",
    "The first few films in this series are both amusing and produced with high technical values, but this fourth in the string is a poorly scripted, anemic production.",
    "More sluggish than a funeral barge, cheaper than a sale at K mart, it's a nerd, it's a shame, it's Superman IV.",
    "Superman IV lacks the wonder and awe of Superman, that giddy sense of boundless possibilities. Superman had gotten old and familiar and the message-movie trappings feel tacked-on and desperate.",
    "Predictably awful fourth installment.",
    "By ordinary movie standards it's awful, but fans of cinematic dementia should have fun for about half an hour.",
    "Superman IV, except for a glitzy new villain named Nuclear Man, is one of the cheesiest movies ever made. It's so grainy and grossly envisioned, it seems filmed on pulp. Superman's crystalline Arctic palace looks as if it's made of no-deposit-no-return soda bottles, and his suit of primary colors has ring around the collar."

For me, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen: history is a jumble of ideas with no logical connection or clear sense, predictable, boring. It begins with an escalation in the nuclear arms race, deftly and promptly resolved by the hero in an absolutely unbelievable way, and then revolves into a rivalry between him and a villain that Lex Luthor creates virtually out of nowhere, since the bombs were destroyed. There are holes almost the size of houses in this silly plot, and the movie really does look like it was made of pieces from various stories sewn together like a patchwork quilt. It's better not to mention the romantic subplot in the film…The cast's performance doesn't help to save it. There is virtually not a single actor or actress who deserves a positive standout. It's not just their fault, but also the hideous script, the undignified material they were given and the atrocious incompetence of director Sidney Furie, who turned out to be so good that it would have been better to make the film without a director at all. Christopher Reeve also deserves a negative note, with a smug, pompous and irritating performance that is an indelible stain on his acting career.Technically, the movie is more than just old… it's archaic, primitive and has aged terribly. The visual and special effects used are so unacceptably far-fetched that they simply shouldn't have been used. They almost turned it into a B-movie. And is it really worth talking about a cinematography without any depth, with bad light and washed-out colors? Perhaps the best thing, really, is to forget about this movie and use the VHS to patch up a limp table.",

My reasons are a few and quite unarguable really.... Firstly I didn't like Superman II much because it felt depressing even with the three villains fighting Superman it just didn't feel nice. Secondly I got to see actor Sam Wanamaker from Raw Deal (1986) and enjoyed his presence onscreen even though he didn't bring much to the actual movie itself. Thirdly actress Mariel Hemingway was always sexy and usually up to no good and she was the kind of woman I'd sleep with and finally I liked the villain and the idea he came from the sun and how Christopher Reeve's Superman character eventually ends up stopping him. Superman IV has many great scenes especially with Superman and Nuclear Man and Gene Hackman as Lex Luther was cool. Not the best movie but okay and certainly better than Superman II.",

Stirred by a schoolboy's letter, Reeve decides to rid the world of nuclear weapons by tossing them in a giant net and throwing them at the sun. Meanwhile, Hackman's Luthor, aided by slang-talking surfer nephew Jon Cryer, creates a new super-rival: Nuclear Man, who locks horns with Reeve against a variety of rear-projection backdrops. By this point, the production values had dipped so low that director Sidney J. Furie might as well have imported footage from the old George Reeves series. Unsurprisingly, the series ended there, its first two entries illustrating what grand-scale entertainment could do, the remainder illustrating the perils of doing it to death.",
