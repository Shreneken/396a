    "Drama"

  "summary": "An unflinching and compelling emotional drama, charting several years in the young lives of four \"fallen woman\" who were rejected by their families and abandoned to the mercy of the Catholic Church in 1960's Ireland.  (Miramax Films)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "A pungent, powerful film that points an accusing finger not at religious beliefs but at flawed human institutions. It also targets social and cultural mores that are almost medieval in their patriarchal bias against girls and women.",
    "Blistering and brilliant work.",
    "A fierce, brilliant film that breaks (and then mends) your heart.",
    "The rare movie that turns cruelty into art.",
    "Although this ain't Hogwarts, there's full-scale witchery being practiced behind Magdalene's locked doors.",
    "A picture so powerfully harrowing, its slight shortcomings are forgettable compared to the entire film's cumulative effect. It's that searing.",
    "Both a masterpiece and a holy hell: Watching it, you feel you're being punished for a crime you didn't commit. Which puts you, come to think of it, in the same frame of mind as those poor Magdalene girls.",
    "Graced with performers who bring a purity of emotion to their work, the film is always dramatically convincing. There is a fundamental air of truth about it, a sense that, horrific though things seem, this is how it must have been.",
    "A stirring, emotionally galvanizing film, not only due to its shattering subject matter but thanks to Mullan's spot-on eye for casting and fluid, uncoercive style.",
    "Mullan's movie is admiringly uncompromising. He refuses to augment the horrors with relief.",
    "While it’s perhaps not the best date film of the year, it is a grim and unmistakable masterpiece of bleak, black sorrow.",
    "The picture has immediacy, force and humanity. It's a muckraking work of art.",
    "The cast is amazing -- two of the lead actresses are first-timers.",
    "A harrowing look at institutional cruelty, perpetrated by the Catholic Church in Ireland, and justified by a perverted hysteria about sex.",
    "The whole system was sadistic and indefensible, and the church, looking the other way as long as profits rolled in from the laundries, deserves the scorn that Mullan and his fine cast heap on it.",
    "It is an unsettling tale told simply and chillingly by director Peter Mullan, with stand-out performances, an evocative soundtrack and spare, haunting visuals.",
    "It is passionate and angry and rousing where you might expect it to become numbing and depressing.",
    "Mullan's increased maturity as a director is evident in his skill at manipulating light and dark dramatic tones, and shifting between moods of anger and plaintive melancholy.",
    "Grim, grueling and triumphantly powerful.",
    "The Magdalene Sisters would be too painful to watch if it didn't have a silver lining. Suffice it to say that it is possible to fly over this religious cuckoo's nest and remain free. All it takes is courage and the timely kindness of strangers.",
    "When it comes time for some of the girls to flee, the result is one of the most emotionally satisfying of all prison breaks.",
    "Why was this film made after the homes had already been abolished? One reason, hardly trifling, is that it was made excellently. Thematically, however, it stings -- as a reminder that Catholicism is only one religion that is dominated by males and that this domination is proprietary.",
    "Its brutal take on living under totalitarian rule periodically suggests Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four.\" Mullan makes the authority figures (such as the nun played by Geraldine McEwan) grimly believable, but as in \"Orphans,\" there are times when he doesn't know when to quit.",
    "A rip-roaring feminist yarn that should offer relief to viewers anxious for an alternative to the boys-with-guns flicks of summer.",
    "Mullan errs by making all the sisters dragon ladies. Still, the film gets to you; it's a powerhouse.",
    "A powerful document of cruelty and sadism.",
    "A disturbing and compelling motion picture that depicts the forces that try to suppress the human spirit, and the strength of these girls in overcoming it.",
    "The film is an attack on religious hypocrisy, mixing melodrama and black humour in a volatile blend.",
    "A film of haunting eloquence and justifiable fury.",
    "If The Magdalene Sisters occasionally flirts with cartoonishness, the movie is tempered by Mullan's considerable filmmaking skills.",
    "The film is beautifully acted by all, but Nora-Jane Noone, as the sloe-eyed orphan Bernadette, is first among equals here, and a genuine find.",
    "This shocker is often shameless, not least in the climactic confrontation with Sister Bridget, but it's impossible not to be moved by the ending -- if only because the torture is finally over.",
    "Generations of healthy spirits were twisted and deformed by the good Sisters of Mercy, all in the name of salvation.",
    "The film might have been more powerful, not to mention fair, if the nuns believed they were doing right; only on movie night, when McEwan sees herself in Ingrid Bergman in \"The Bells Of St. Mary's,\" does Mullan grant her so much as the delusion of rectitude.",
    "The horrors therein are vivid, even if the movie is a bit plodding.",
    "Though it has a tendency to leave characters undeveloped and storylines empty, the overall portrait is significant."

      "content": "\"The Magdalene Sisters\", directed by Peter Mullan centers on four girls—Margaret, Bernadette, Rose, and Crispina, played respectively by Anne-Marie Duff, Nora-Jane Noone, Dorothy Duffy, and Eileen Walsh—who in puritanical mid-20th century\"The Magdalene Sisters\", directed by Peter Mullan centers on four girls—Margaret, Bernadette, Rose, and Crispina, played respectively by Anne-Marie Duff, Nora-Jane Noone, Dorothy Duffy, and Eileen Walsh—who in puritanical mid-20th century Ireland are, after certain so-called sinful indiscretions causing the rejection of their families, sent to a strict Catholic reformatory. Also very much should be noted is the role of the head at this place, the very strict twisted Sister Bridget played by Geraldine McEwan. The performances by Walsh and McEwan deserve particular mention, one a kind and unbalanced victim, the other as deliberate, cold victimizer.\r “Fallen women” they are supposed to be, but I certainly never saw them as any more than victims of high-and-mighty, ignorant, and often sadistic attempts to take anyone who dare stray the least from societies way (even if may be no fault of their own, as in at least one of the cases) and put them in their place. The stuff found within this movie, disturbing and sometimes strange as it is, and though we’re talking about only the mid-20th Century, historically not that long ago, never came off as the least bit unbelievable to me. It forces one to look at these tough images, never making it easy in the discipline and punishments imposed by the institution. Even one comical scene of apparent levity turns suddenly into a most disquieting unjust sequence for one of the characters. It’s a place where one often needs to fend for themselves, and can even encourage them to turn on each other. Painful as it is, there is some hope as well. I highly recommend this film.",
