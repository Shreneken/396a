  "critic_reviews": [
    "This inept 2003 melodrama has become a Rocky Horror-style cult favorite...As someone who's watched more bad movies than you can imagine, I'm mostly immune to the so-bad-it's-good aesthetic, though I can see how, viewed in a theater at midnight after a few drinks, this might conjure up its own hilariously demented reality.",
    "Tommy Wiseau's film oozes sincerity, which is then slathered in a thick coating of oblivious narcissism, and sadly serves as an example that not everyone should follow their bliss...It's the emotional earnestness that places The Room squarely within Susan Sontag's famous definition of pure camp.",
    "The Room marks the writing-directing-acting debut of Tommy Wiseau, who's not just one of the most unusual looking and sounding (with an unidentifiable Eastern European accent) leading men ever to grace the screen, but a narcissist nonpareil whose movie makes Vincent Gallo's \"The Brown Bunny\" seem the apotheosis of cinematic self-restraint.",
    "That’s the trick to making a cult film. It can’t just be bad, it has to be memorably so, and The Room is."

It is written, produced, directed by and starring Tommy Wiseau as a banker named Johnny.\r Johnny lives a sort-of happy life in San Francisco, he is engaged to his \"future wife\" named Lisa (Juliette Danielle), I use the term \"future wife\" because that's what this movie is saying. The first problem with their chemistry is pretty much everything, they do not look like a couple...if you saw the two of them walking down the street, the last thing you would ever think is them being madly in love. Wiseau looks way too old for her.\r The first half-an-hour of this movie is four different sex scenes...these scenes drive the movie nowhere, they just put the movie to a dead standstill. The sex scenes are not at all steamy in the slightest...they are actually quite hard to watch.\r Later we discover that Lisa is having some extra on the side, she calls Johnny's best friend Mark (Greg Sestero), and it turns out that she seduces him and they have sex...on the swirly staircase...that is a very interesting location since the bedrooms are only a few steps up the stairs, and that the front door is beside the staircase, so it's a surprise that none of them get caught. That was close.\r There are so many subplots added to the movie that also lead it nowhere, we hear about Lisa's mother Claudette (Carolyn Minnott) having breast cancer, we never hear about this later on in the movie...we even see Claudette in later scenes of the movie and her health doesn't seem to have deteriorated. There is one pointless scene where we see the young character named Denny (Philip Haldiman) getting into some trouble with a big thug named Chris R (Dan Janjigian)...this scene is over before it even begins. And, of course, who can forget the football scenes...\r ...this is really where the film (can I even say it's a \"film\"?) starts to get dragged down by pointless padding. There is this one scene where we see the main characters; Johnny, Mark, Denny and a psychologist named Peter (Kyle Vogt) dressed up in tuxedos, so you think it's finally the wedding day of Johnny and Lisa. Nope! Wrong, they end up going outside, and toss around the football about three times (yes, I counted), and then Peter trips and falls over, and they decide to go back inside the house. What was the point of this scene? If you took this scene out, it would not affect the movie, but then again, it wouldn't improve much either.\r Later on in the movie, Johnny decides to record phone calls as he begins to grow suspicious that Lisa is hiding something. This is sort-of important later.\r We cut to Johnny's birthday party and all of his friends are there...apart from Peter, if you've read Greg Sestero's book \"The Disaster Artist\", you'll know why. Mark and Lisa decide to feel each other up again... during the party!!! And surprise! They're caught, by a random character who we do not know, nor does the screenplay allow us to get into detail about him, he's just some guy that finds out about Mark and Lisa's affair behind Johnny's back.\r Johnny does find out about this affair, and is very angry about it. The thing is; Wiseau tries to position his audience to make us care and feel sorry for him...I don't care...nor do I feel sorry for him. His acting is so over-the-top sometimes, and laughable, you are fully aware that you are watching the film.\r But the worst performance by far is from actress Robyn Paris, who plays Lisa's best friend, Michelle. I know a lot of people say Wiseau's acting is bad, but her acting makes Tommy Wiseau look like Daniel Day-Lewis. Seriously, she is bad.\r The dialogue here is atrocious, too. \"I did not hit her, it's not true, it's bulls**t, I did not hit her, I did NOT\" *throws bottle in anger and notices Mark* \"Oh hi, Mark\". Or try...\"No, I cannot talk about that now, anyway, how's your sex life?\" Who asks like that?! Better yet, there's that famous \"You're tearing me apart, Lisa\".\r 'The Room' is the worst film ever made, period. It drags, there is a lot of padding, there are stories and characters that are introduced, but then are removed abruptly...and the story is generic and uninspired. God knows what was going through Tommy Wiseau's head when he was making this. Although, it is enjoyable, I am rating this a rare 0/10 simply because it is a film that is bad in every level...but on an entertaining level, it does get a 10/10...for all the wrong reasons.\r You're tearing me apart, Tommy Wiseau.",

Me and 7 of my friends were having a movie night yesterday and my friend Stephen brought this with him, claiming \"I don't know what this is and apparently no one on the planet does so we should watch it.\" There was me, Stephan, Mason and Shane who are all male and Anna, Katie, Zoe and Gina who are female (I'm saying this just so I can establish and go into more detail about one of our reactions later) and all of us had different reactions to what we were seeing. Me, Mason Anna and Katie were looking on in confusion throughout the whole thing, Stephen and Shane were laughing uncontrollably, Gina was offended and Zoe fell asleep.\r There was just so much stuff wrong in this thing that I repeatedly asked the question \"why was this made? What possessed Tommy Wiseau to make this? Did he intentionally make this bad? Did he make this to\rsettle debt? Did he actually think he could become a memorable film director?\" I can only answer one of those questions, he became a memorable film director/producer/writer/actor but for the wrong reasons.\r Where do I start? The acting is some of the worst caught on camera. I was in an amateur theatre production by Queen's hall arts called Minor's Strike and I would like to emphasize, it was an amateur production and all of our acting was praised in the performance and I was 13 at the time. These actors, who are around their 30s/40s are acting worse than we did and we were amateurs and hadn't taken acting\rschool at the time. Tommy Wiseau is easily the worst though. He is the worst actor and this film and what goes well with a bad actor you might ask? Badly written dialogue for this bad actor to spout out.\r \"We have a new client at the bank we make a lot of money, anyway how is your sex life\" This is an actual piece of dialogue that was delivered by Tommy Wiseau, imagine that an 8 year old French boy is saying this line and you will get Tommy Wiseau's whole performance.\r There are also these really uncomfortable sex scene moments which is what Gina was offended by. I know that we're in an age where the ESRB raters are awfully sceptical about letting certain age demographics\rwatch certain movies and usually controversy is applauded by audience and that's why Harvester and Hatred got as much attention as they did but this thing in The Room, these sex scenes which is applauded by possibly the horn word (not allowed to say it because of Metacritic's rules) teenage boy demographic, these sort of scenes are just plain awkward for people to sit through. Also, there is about 5 of these\runcomfortable sex scenes in this film, each lasting about 5 mins. Which means the total amount of time we spent watching some porno was just under 1/3 of the film.\r There are also these really weird scenes that don't go anywhere. They happen and then that's it.\r I wish there was a way that I could unsee this film and none of you get this film, even if you're curious, don' get it. I wish to never see Tommy Wiseau in anything again, if he even is in anything else and if he is, there's something wrong with this world.",

Some dialogues are just dubbed after the movie in post production, and it sounds awful in the movie, cause it's easily noticeable the change of voice quality between studio and shooting, not to mention the lip movement that ends up getting very weird. I can feel that they tried to put some epic shots, wiht beautiful ambience and some nice music in the back, and it kind of works like how it's done, just not how it was suposed to. But it really makes you laugh and have some fun, that famous punch line followed by the \"hahaha\" that got me everytime. A terrible love triangle story that becomes a GREAT involuntary comedy.

I'm pretty sure Tommy Wiseau had some sort of message about life and love that he wanted to give us. Maybe even one that was deep and insightful. It's impossible to tell though as the movie is incomprehensible.It runs on a loop of the characters having the same conversations over and over again with the occasional nonsensical moment or long, drawn out sex scene thrown in to break up the monotony. The dialog the cast was given is atrocious and they seem to be playing people who are only capable of making the dumbest possible decisions at any given moment. The acting isn't as bad as you would expect. With the exception of Sestero and Wiseau himself I actually thought there were some decent performances for a movie of this caliber. Sestero seems uninterested in really trying as a result of being fully aware of just how bad the project was going to turn out. Wiseau on the other hand is just a block of wood. Even his fits of rage seem devoid of energy.The direction and writing are just all around terrible. But rather than creating something that's painful to watch, Wiseau's ineptness both behind and in front of the camera inadvertently led to The Room becoming strangely lovable instead. It's still an awful movie, but at the same time it's hard to not be entranced by the unnatural interactions between everybody onscreen as it's all just too funny. As uncomfortable as the sex scenes are to watch I couldn't help but laugh. They have the corniest love songs playing overtop of them and Wiseau apparently doesn't know where the vagina is located. I couldn't tell is he was putting it between her breasts or just had some sort of weird bellybutton penetration fetish. The whole thing is a great source of unintentional hilarity. I'm not sure that's cause enough to recommend it though.1.3/10",

In my case, I watch film to be entertained, sure, but first and foremost, I watch it to see artistic quality. When it comes to The Room, it certainly delivers entertainment, but it's only because of its blatant disregard for all that makes film great. Quality acting, directing, writing, cinematography, production design, and editing, are all left behind in this tale of love, deceit, and I am honestly not sure what else. While it delivers many laughs, it is at its own expense, as the comedy is to be found not in the quality comedic writing, but in the acting and horrendous dramatic writing. A serious film, this one could be mistaken to be a comedy if you did not know better. Really, the best quality brings to the table is an additional running joke for you to have with anybody you watch it with. Thus, I recommend gathering a group of friends together, popping some popcorn, and sitting back and enjoying everything that makes The Room the film it is. Honestly the worst film I have ever seen, but probably one of the most entertaining and rewarding experiences of my life.",

How can I avoid releasing a torrent of anger wrapped in objective criticism?The Room is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen in my life and yes it is probably one of the worst in history, this movie is an argumentative and narrative vomit that lacks of all the basic rules of cinematic language, it is as disconnected as stupid and boring, is as unsuccessful as indescribable and lets say it, the background story of the script has a thematic full of clichés but any screenwriter with some talent could have made something respectable from it, but Wiseau's script is a **** disaster. A **** disaster to which he gave a beginning and an ending but everything else is just crap.Believe me, unless you are someone like me who always finishes a movie or worse you enjoy it, I do not know how a regular audicence could find reasons or excuses to continue after the first twenty five minutes.And it's not only the lousy script or the bad direction, The Room is also plagued by such miserable performances that I cannot understand how they moved forward when they were editing. Everything looks neglected, false, overacted and most importantly, everything looks lost and out of focus, not only is the stupidity of the dialogues and the abandoned narrative threads, it's the way in which these things come out of the mouth of the actors. What was their motivation? I ignore it, maybe I should read the book or Franco's movie will throw some answers, otherwise it will remain an incredible mystery for me.Leaving aside the film a little, what concerns me now is what the film has become, because for those who do not know this movie is now considered a cult film, yes a cult film, with special screenings in which Wiseau finally has some success and hhe embrace it without any kind of reluctance, let's say that it was the success he longed for, but it's worth asking if it's valid to find success in mediocrity.Who are to blame for it? Who creates it or who consumes it? And don't get me wrong, I always advocate for what people enjoys or love, but you have to be able to draw a line, because if they convert this type of mediocrity into success what does it says about the spectators? What about the great films that are ignored annually and are condemned to the dark while this is the object of admiration and success? What do we aspire to? Failing in order to achieve fame by being a joke? Honestly with what I've seen in the trailers and the interviews, that's precisely what Franco is doing, maybe Wiseau ignores it or if he doesn't, he let it go, in one way or another the recognition is already his.Honestly, avoid it, stay away from The Room, there is nothing in it nor you will learn anything from it, it is a miserable movie, a crushing failure with all its letters, is bad and yes, not even the involuntary humor works for a ****",

The main character of Johnny instantly made an impression on me from the moment he stepped on screen, and the supporting actors only made him better. Tommy Wiseau is one of those men who can produce, act, direct, and edit all at the same time on a godly level that no one had ever witnessed before now. His performance cemented himself as one of Hollywood's elites and made the already-great supporting cast even more enjoyable to watch. The plot is perfectly paced and varied, with all scenes coming together at the end for an impeccable finale. No talent is wasted or misdirected, and the dialogue is so hauntingly realistic that it makes it hard to believe that the actors were given a script to work off of. Overall this film gets a 9.9/10 from me, the only thing that is holding it back is that the 1.5 hour run time is just painfully short, and makes the film seem like only a snippet of what these talented people can really do.",

This is seen several times in the film as characters walk in a door, then 45 seconds into them being there, declare that they have to go, and leave. Most scenes end in characters walking out of doors.\r You can hear the creepyness in Tommy Wiseau's voice, character, and dialogue. He sounds like he can barely speak english, pronouncing world like \"worild\".\rJohnny, the main character, is almost always seen in a black suit with a loosened tie. Johnny is has long, black hair, that always appears to be the same.\r Most characters in the film express their affection towards Johnny. Close friends talk about how he's their favorite friend, mothers talk about how he is a great person, and store owners tell him that he is their favorite customer.

The dialogue is as bad as the acting as it seems like an elementary schooler wrote them and 70% of the time what the characters are conversing about doesn't even make sense along with several pointless scenes that serve no purpose to the story. Several plot points are brought up and then quickly forgotten, and there are some \"filler\" scenes that serve no purpose at all and they make the movie unnecessarily longer than it should have been. Some characters are never even introduced so you'll be thinking who are they and what exactly is their role? The cinematography and quality of the film sucks too, it is obvious in certain scenes that they are behind a green screen and the characters do some stuff that is never really explained (for example: Dressing in a tuxedo and then playing football and doing normal things while wearing it but not ever really finding out why they did wear them in the first place.) What is that supposed to be saying about the idea? The movie after a while can get really boring because it fails to grip you as I was already losing interest before even the first fifteen minutes of the film. There are countless complaints that I can think of for this movie, Wiseau got just about everything wrong but all of these screw-ups do make the film unintentionaly funny and it doesn't help that the film takes itself too seriously and the main plot, it tried to have a good idea going, I give it credit for that, but there were just so many holes and inconsistencies that it fails miserably. Overall, one word to describe \"The Room\" would be \"Awful\", I have never seen a bigger disgrace and failure of a film before. Absolutely the worst film I have ever seen.

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of psychology most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head.No, seriously, you have to be fairly intelligent to find this film funny. All of it is completely unintentional. Tommy Wiseau looks at the world through alien glasses. His total lack of self-critique, his almost perfect confidence in his writing/acting/directing is staggering. Not a single thing in 'The Room' is what it's meant to be. Jokes aren't funny, serious moments are hilarious, sex scenes are all the same and off-putting. It takes the one and only Tommy Wiseau to do what others simply can't. This isn't 'a poo on a stick' type of art. This is an attempt to create another Mona Lisa by someone whose painting skills stopped developing at the age of 5.

It really is a terrible movie. Words cannot really describe the terribleness, but I will attempt it nonetheless. 1. The actors are terrible. The characters they portray are idiotic beyond the measure of a Stanford-Binet test. There's one character (excluding the main character who... again, words escape me in trying to describe the terrible acting) who is just downright creepy and just left me with an urge to punch the screen. Random plot points are quickly introduced, forgotten just as quickly. A character mentions they have a terminal disease. One sentence. You will never hear about it again thereafter. One scene involves a classy costume change for a group of men for an unexplained reason. Plot be damned, this movie defies logic. And the dialogue. I don't even know where to start on the dialogue. Really, this movie leaves me confused in that it's difficult for me to explain the terribleness of the film when you haven't seen it. But if you watch it, didn't the self proclaimed writer/producer/executive producer/director/composer/cinematographer/genius, Tommy Wiseau get what he wanted? Doesn't that actually make him some sort of deranged genius? It's the little things really, like giving this movie any score above a 5 that will eventually add up to create societal collapse, and our grandchildren will curse us for it.",
