Meanwhile, just down the street, a seemingly unrelated story of jealousy and betrayal unfolds. Red is an intimate look at forged connections and a splendid final statement from a remarkable filmmaker at the height of his powers. [Criterion]… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "This is the kind of film that makes you feel intensely alive while you're watching it, and sends you out into the streets afterwards eager to talk deeply and urgently, to the person you are with. Whoever that happens to be.",
    "Red succeeds so stirringly that it also bestows some much-needed magic upon its predecessors, \"Blue\" and \"White.\" The first film's chic emptiness and the second's relative drabness are suddenly made much rosier by the seductive glow of Red.",
    "Red, the final chapter of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy, is a subtle masterpiece. With its satisfying exploration of such complex and diverse themes as destiny and platonic love, Red is not only a self-contained motion picture, but a fitting conclusion to the series.",
    "Red is the best of the lot: warmer, more accessible, unusually generous toward its characters. A mystical tale of chance encounters and unexpected connections, Red uses a traffic accident as a springboard to discovery.",
    "In this final installment of a glorious trilogy (which includes the films “Blue” and “White”) he has saved his greatest for last.",
    "The film courses with vitality -- and makes you glad to be alive. Kieslowski's deft touch gives Red its real magic; in the end, the subtle nuances are what stay with you.",
    "Red, the beautifully spun and splendidly acted tale of a young model’s decisive encounter with a retired judge, is another deft, deeply affecting variation on Krzysztof Kieslowski’s recurring theme that people are interconnected in ways they can barely fathom. If it’s true — as the helmer has announced — that this opus will be his last foray into film directing, Kieslowski retires at a formal and philosophical peak.",
    "Exquisitely shot, superbly acted and deftly written, this is easily one of the best arthouse films of the nineties.",
    "It is a film of much humanity and very far from smart European pap. But the external brilliance of its making does at times subvert its inner workings, as if its manufacture and its meaning were not quite in perfect harmony."

The relationship Valentine-KernEnjoyed and Satisfied by this Trilogy,Honestly my favourite was Blue,but For me Red is the best among the three existing movie. I prefer to feel the emotional attachment that is caused by a lovable character. The relationship Valentine-Kern also very well established. Nuance that is built through the theme of brotherhood in this movie also made me much more like Red than his two predecessors. If Blue feels depressed and White feels a bit loose and too light, then Red is really touching and Glamorous. Of course, ending in this film as well Magnificent. No need to be a crazy twist to so surprising. No need for a scene so touching melodrama. Yes, the moment in which the Blue, White and Red met made me surprised, amazed, touched. Moreover.",

If the previous ones depicted the ideologies of the aftermath of catastrophic events and aa survival instinct..Trois Couleurs: RedKieslowski's final step to its dramatic trilogy is more soothing and lighter than any of its installment. If the previous ones depicted the ideologies of the aftermath of catastrophic events and a subjective procedure of how to survive them, this one at least grabs your attention with a lighter perspective. Nevertheless, the gist remains the same, the method is more subtle and complex than the previous ones. This one is made to make you sweat on your seat. It demands you to be on the edge of your seat. It is a tale that makes you think. The argumentative conversation, morally complex situation and ethically challenged solutions, this one is much more talkative and yet is still inexpressive than any of its chapter.It is way too layered and mature than we usually get. This final death sentence of the trilogy, is a remarkable revelations on terms of storytelling. Kieslowski has much more Shakespeare in him than it comes off. He takes those same emotion and impute them at different situations and different characters, and projects the range and parallel nature of that single emotion. The narrative is adaptive and layered with sharp conversations that amps up the charge to a whole new level. There is more ruggedness in here, despite of it not being that sinister and dark than its previous chapters.It stands alone in the entire trilogy. This one is brighter and sweeter, it doesn't demand attention, it just keeps pulling you back in with its unstoppable force. Trintignant is a threat on screen, he can be mean as a street but his nurturing is quite mellow. His ideologies are off track and yet sane than most of the characters. But personally, I prefer, Jacob's simpler and honest character. The innocence of hers that is latter filtered by the outer perspective, is just one of the best bits of the feature. Trois Couleurs: Red is the perfect conclusion to the trilogy, it has a survival instinct.",
