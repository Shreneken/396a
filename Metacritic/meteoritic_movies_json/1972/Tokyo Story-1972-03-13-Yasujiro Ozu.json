  "summary": "Yasujiro Ozu’s Tokyo Story follows an aging couple, Tomi and Sukichi, on their journey from their rural village to visit their two married children in bustling, postwar Tokyo. Their reception is disappointing: too busy to entertain them, their children send them off to a health spa. After Tomi falls ill she and Sukichi return home, whileYasujiro Ozu’s Tokyo Story follows an aging couple, Tomi and Sukichi, on their journey from their rural village to visit their two married children in bustling, postwar Tokyo. Their reception is disappointing: too busy to entertain them, their children send them off to a health spa. After Tomi falls ill she and Sukichi return home, while the children, grief-stricken, hasten to be with her. From a simple tale unfolds one of the greatest of all Japanese films. Starring Ozu regulars Chishu Ryu and Setsuko Hara, the film reprises one of the director’s favorite themes—that of generational conflict—in a way that is quintessentially Japanese and yet so universal in its appeal that it continues to resonate as one of cinema’s greatest masterpieces.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "Hardly anything actually happens, and yet it's one of the most emotionally involving dramas ever made.",
    "Tokyo Story moves quite slowly by our Western standards, and requires more patience at first than some moviegoers may be willing to supply. Its effect is cumulative, however; the pace comes to seem perfectly suited to the material.",
    "[Hara's] sad dignity and emotional generosity are compelling.",
    "Yasujiro Ozu's portrait of familial relations, first seen in 1953, is marked by an indefinable melancholy that settles on the frame as softly as snow.",
    "Even on the basis of a limited exposure to his work, the story seems archetypal Ozu.",
    "In this exquisite merging of specific and universal, infinite and infinitesimal, Tokyo Story perhaps most clearly illuminates that Ozu is not the most Japanese of filmmakers, but the most human.",
    "Above all, Hara's smile and Ryu's sigh are a touching show of good faith and the genuine pleasure they take in each other's company–which, of course, makes their response to life's disappointments all the more poignant.",
    "Tokyo Story, Ozu’s 1953 magnum opus, has frequently been acclaimed by filmmakers and critics alike as the greatest film ever made, and it very arguably could be. Regardless of where you’d place it on the hierarchy of the “best ever’s\", Tokyo Story is certainly the ultimate family film—that is, the ultimate film about family and what family actually means.",
    "The movie...remains perhaps the wisest of family dramas, an experience as wrenching as it is restorative.",
    "This 1953 classic is one of the cinema's most profound and moving studies of married love, ageing and the relations between parents and children. It is flawless and rewards numerous viewings.",
    "Tokyo Story is as much a journey of discovery as it is an opportunity to reflect. The characters populating this film aren’t strangers. They are our parents, our children, ourselves.",
    "Ozu may have made subtler films, but the clarity of his social critique here is wrenching and unassailable.",
    "Often topping lists of the best films of all time, and a great influence on many great directors of the last half century, not least for its purity of expression, this remains one of the most approachable and moving of all cinema’s masterpieces.",
    "Protracted sequences make you impatient for forward motion, but then, in an instant, you’re left to mourn beauties hastened away.",
    "Ozu's is a cinema of distillation: no jagged cuts and tracks, just a serenely still camera allowing a purity of emotion to trickle free. The result is a quiet, devastating poignancy that gently envelops you en route to an absolute tear-streamer of an ending.",
    "A masterpiece, minimalist cinema at its finest and most complex.",
    "Delicately constructed and deliberately leisurely, TOKYO STORY allows its dramatic content and thematic concerns to envelop an audience the way social mores envelop the films' characters."

Parenthood is not for everyone, but we all have parents, we forever hold a sense of regret towards them, especially in the oriental culture, filial piety is the foremost virtue to measure an individual’s worth, at least viewed by other family members.\r keep reading my review on my blog, google: cinema omnivore, thanks!",

What i see is callous, selfish people. 3 generations of them.  They never care one bit about each other, only whether they are personally inconvenienced.  The daughter in law that is a widow to the son who died was sweet and lonely, everyone else seems only interested in running out the clock until death and being distracted from that goal.  There is no love, no depth, only selfish people unconscious of their lives and the world around them, just like real people.  Robots judging robots, fake statements, fake emotions. It's like the Borg (Star Trek) had a funeral.",

The film expresses that with showing an old couple visit their children, and you could think that it's not enough to base a film around but somehow Tokyo Story make it look so simple and deliver it so perfectly. That's one of the reasons that make this film so special. Another thing is how its made, the film is of course very old and the way of filming was sourly very different back then. The film is so casual and something other films don't tend to include or think about to include is well built-in in this film, and it's those little things which make it so special. I also think this film could not be made again the same way nor some other way then it did, it just so perfect with the time period, the culture, the characters, the atmosphere, etc. But the film still has so much reflection of the reality and maybe more than ever.",
