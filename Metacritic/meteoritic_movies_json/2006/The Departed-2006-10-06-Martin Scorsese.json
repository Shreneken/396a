Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), street-smart and tough, is purported to have a violent temper that costs him his badge and eventually lands him back on the rough streets of South Boston, where he is recruited into Costello's ranks. But neither man is what he seems and, as they work at cross purposes, they are plunged into a dangerous game of cat and mouse in which the stakes could not be higher.  [Warner Bros.]… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "A new American crime classic from the legendary Martin Scorsese, whose talent shines here on its highest beams.",
    "A ferociously entertaining film.",
    "The Departed is Scorsese's most purely enjoyable movie in years. But it's not for the faint of heart. It's rude, bleak, violent and defiantly un-PC. But if you doubt that it's also OK to laugh throughout this rat's nest of paranoia, deceit and bloodshed, keep your eyes on the final frames. Scorsese's parting shot is an uncharacteristic, but well-earned, wink.",
    "The original film was gritty and entertaining (\"Infernal Affairs\"); the new version is a masterpiece - the best effort Scorsese has brought to the screen since \"Goodfellas.\"",
    "A triumphant revisiting of territory in which Scorsese is an unchallenged master -- the crime drama.",
    "DiCaprio harnesses a terrific, buggy intensity reminiscent of \"GoodFellas'\" hopped-up Henry Hill (Ray Liotta).",
    "When a director of Scorsese's caliber is working at the top of his game, it's a reminder of why we go to the movies in the first place.",
    "A movie-movie of the first rank.",
    "This is the most vibrant, exciting and invigorating movie-movie of the year.",
    "Thelma Schoonmaker, a Scorsese collaborator for over a quarter-century, did the bull's-eye editing. The moviemaking throughout is swift, unaffected, masterly.",
    "A thrilling return to form.",
    "It is intriguing to wonder what Scorsese saw in the Hong Kong movie that inspired him to make the second remake of his career (after \"Cape Fear\"). I think he instantly recognized that this story, at a buried level, brought two sides of his art and psyche into equal focus.",
    "The very title The Departed suggests a James Joycean take on Irish-Catholic sentiment when, of course, this story is anything but: It's Scorsesean, and he's in full bloom.",
    "DiCaprio's performance is a revelation only for those who have underestimated him. In Scorsese's previous films, \"The Gangs of New York\" and \"The Aviator,\" he seemed callow and miscast, but here he has the presence of a full-bodied adult. He's grown into his emotions.",
    "Whatever it is, the film is the first major release of the fall worth talking about: a fast-paced, visually slick, psychologically fascinating Boston-set cops-and-crooks saga.",
    "It isn't in the same league as the director's best work, chiefly because it lacks the bravura flourishes of cinematic craft that helped make his name. But it's so vital and bloody and funny and wicked and tense and unapologetic that it feels kin to those films, which little of the director's work of the past decade has managed to pull off.",
    "This reworking of a popular Hong Kong picture pulses with energy, tangy dialogue and crackling performances from a fine cast.",
    "Scorsese didn't need to remake \"Infernal Affairs,\" but what he has done with it is a compliment rather than an affront to the original: The Departed reimagines its source material rather than just leeching off it, preserving the bone structure of the first movie while finding new curves in it. The story has been clarified; the ellipses of the original have been filled in with just the right amount of exploratory shading. This is a picture of grand gestures and subtle intricacies, a movie that, even at more than two hours long, feels miraculously lean. It's a smart shot of lucid storytelling.",
    "This is a dream cast for both Scorsese and the viewer, and everyone is working at the peak of their craft. Nicholson's flawless performance as the increasingly unhinged crime boss is a marvel of manic, paranoid ruination.",
    "The film's score and editing brilliantly heighten the film's energy, keeping the audience somewhat off-kilter and unsure where things are headed.",
    "The profanity-laced but witty and literate dialogue by William Monahan (\"Kingdom of Heaven\") is delivered by a brilliantly chosen cast, almost all of whom are operating at the very top of their game.",
    "It's a movie with a pulse. Sometimes, it flies off the chart.",
    "When The Departed roars to life, as it does in so many of its scenes, you feel like nobody understands movies -- the delirious highs, the unforgiving moral depths -- as well as this man does. Welcome back, Marty.",
    "The movie works smashingly, especially if you haven't seen its Hong Kong counterpart and haven't a clue what's coming. But for all its snap, crackle, and pop, it's nowhere near as galvanic emotionally.",
    "Back to the streets and with a stellar cast, Martin Scorsese proves once again that he's the master of urban storytelling -- and of thrillingly violent filmmaking.",
    "What helps make The Departed at once a success and a relief isn't that the director of \"Kundun,\" Mr. Scorsese's deeply felt film about the Dalai Lama, is back on the mean streets where he belongs; what's at stake here is the film and the filmmaking, not the director's epic importance.",
    "Frequently excessive but never dull, The Departed is a little too much of a lot of the things that define Martin Scorsese films but it's also almost impossible to resist. Too operatic at times, too in love with violence and macho posturing at others, it's a potboiler dressed up in upscale designer clothes, but oh how that pot does boil.",
    "Crackles right along, stopping only long enough for Scorsese's signature bursts of explosive violence. Those brawls feel a bit rote, but what's different here is a newfound playful humor.",
    "Not one of Scorsese's greatest films; it doesn't use the camera to reveal the psychological and aesthetic dimensions of an entire world, as \"Mean Streets,\" \"Taxi Driver,\" \"Raging Bull,\" and \"Goodfellas\" did. But it's a viciously merry, violent, high-wattage entertainment, and speech is the most brazenly flamboyant element in it.",
    "The Departed exists in a movie-place about as far from personal statements as a storied director can get. Maybe those days for Scorsese are long gone. But Scorsese's sense of craft remains sure.",
    "There's no attempt at greatness here, just a fabulously successful attempt at a good crime movie. The Oscar-bait self-consciousness of \"Gangs of New York\" and \"The Aviator\" is gone. In its place is a buoyancy, an impish delight in telling a harsh urban story in the most effective terms possible.",
    "The Departed is completely engrossing, a master class in suspense. But in moral terms it may be the least involving story that Scorsese -- an artist much preoccupied with morality -- has ever taken on.",
    "This isn't to say The Departed is a bad movie, far from it, but knowing who's directing it and the amount of talent he had to work with, it's hard not to be disappointed that Scorsese didn't knock us on our asses. Is it his best movie since \"Goodfellas?\" Sure, but it falls shy of that film's excellence.",
    "It's nice to see Scorsese back in the saddle and a treat to find a cops-and-robbers thriller with some energy and wit. But even so, it's a stylish head rush of a movie that flies by, even at two-and-a-half hours, and keeps turning the knife (and your stomach) up to the final scene.",
    "Rarely has a star's look-at-me turn so completely torpedoed a project. Whenever the picture threatens to gain some momentum, up pops Jack to stop it dead in its tracks. The loyal few may be laughing with him, but the rest of us are definitely laughing at him.",
    "Neither a debacle nor a bore, The Departed works but only up to a point, and never emotionally--even if the director does contrive to supply his version of a happy ending.",
    "Scorsese in his prime might've made better use of this hamming, but this picture feels like an exercise by a Scorsese clone who has tackled the master's themes - without his energy and economy of style.",
    "Is Scorsese desperate? This screenplay has the scent of it, as if he is scraping for material to feed his basic filmic interests. But the risk in this case--not evaded--was that his need led him close to painful strain. I can't remember another Scorsese moment as shockingly banal as the finishing touch here."

Faced with the reality of sociopathic criminals and blood-ridden crime scenes even the good guys get gritty.  And on the topic of sociopathy, Jack Nicholson unflinchingly becomes the personification of depravity.  For me, the graphic violence and bad language is justified: these are men pushed to their limits.  And the death of the characters (especially the unexpected death of DiCaprio's character) is shocking and therefore the violence of their deaths should also be shocking.",

Critics pretended it was good so that Scorsese could win his best picture that he never won before for the times he really did deserve it like Goodfellas and Casino. This movie was ridiculously unrealistic. Jack Nicholson was horrible in his role. Why would the mob boss be personally involved in all the day to day business? Unrealistic. Why would he personally meet with his police dept. mole in the adult movie theatre and then whip out a s*x toy and do a weird joke thing? That was one of the worst scenes I've ever seen. He was annoying and not all likeable or interesting. He constantly wore that stupid hat and ugly glasses and when he didn't, he had his overly long hair which flared on the sides like they were little wings. Stupid and frustrating to look at. Also, there was the constant offensive language and profanity. Why the need for all the racial and anti-LGBT language? Another horrible scene: when Alec Baldwin's character tells the other guy, \"You one of those guys who works out? Go f*ck yourself\". Yes, that's how bad the dialogue was. The script was unbearably bad. Also, the main female character of a psychiatrist? Why would she sleep with her client who acts like a total lunatic and is extremely insulting to her? Is this Scorsese's fantasy of women? You can treat them like crap and then they break their professional ethics to sleep with you? Horrible. I just watched Casino the night before and was on a Scorsese kick. Wow, what a comparison. Casino is about 100 times better than this one. I can't believe I thought this was a good movie when it first came out. What was I thinking? I guess if you are desperate enough to believe the hype, you can like just about anything. I guess that explains all the positive reviews here. Sad. Deeply painful movie to watch and not at all worth the 2.5 hours of my life I'll never get back.

Finally, the cover of Pink Floyd's classic Comfortably Numb was absolutely terrible, I actually cringed when I heard this beautiful song being completely butchered.

While the HK verison had some plot devices, there was a lot implausible gaps and forced concepts that didn't work out in the American version. Like a boss sitting in the front of a car so the mole can communicate in the back. A gang boss will never sit in the front of a car! Using cell-phones to bring down a gang is just lame and un-inspiring! Colin Sullivan, who claimed to not be able to use the password on his computer all of a sudden uses it to delete Costigans profile on his very own computer seconds later. The list goes on and gets very tiresome to mention. Didn't anyone review these forced issues and plotholes before making the film? That's right, they just tried to copy IA, forgetting about the lost in translation consequences. Its a shame that America never bothered to release the IA trilogy instead in theaters. The original stories encompassed balanced story-telling, better suspense and emotional content, slick cat-and mouse chase, psychological dept, and well-developed and intriguing characters. We also get to see how being in the police and triads truly bring grief in their lives. The Departed was done sloppy in comparison only saved by typical Scorsese violence and swearing. The characters in Departed were lame and boring. Billy Costigan (Leo Dicpario) is the only character probably that got his role right. Matt Damon, a good actor, had a very dull and typical bad guy character in comparison to Andy Lau's tormented role in IA. Martin Sheen was a poor father figure and a watse of time. and of course, there are other lame, pointless filler characters that aren't worth mentioning. Sadly, Scorsese will get praises from the audience no matter how he makes his films. Had Scorsese's name not been on the director's list, this film would had got a worser rating. All in all, it was IA that was more realistic. People say Departed is, but tell yourself this, not one person swears that much, nor do you see bloodshed like that in reality. 4 guys getting bullets in their heads one after another? There was a reason why IA had the bullet in the head scenerio but Scorsese and Monahan just really never knew what it meant, did they?",

I guess I didn't get the word that The Departed was in the running for best director...likely, because it's ridiculous that it be considered & placed among the ranks of films actually worthy of the nomination for Best Director! Really...I like Scorses's films, for the most part. But let's face it, even those considered to be among the best at their craft can bomb now & then. The Departed was entertaining at first, but ended up a monumental disappointment & certainly not \"award-worthy!\" It took too much work to stay involved in the movie. I witnessed so many blatant flaws, it was incredible. A completely convoluted movie - one that should have been a Movie of the Week or on HBO...but a Golden Globe contender? Actually, I think I was okay with the movie until about the last 40 minutes. But, whether I liked the movie or not, it wasn't worthy of a Golden Globe - or any award, for that matter! It did explain to me, however, why Nicolson sat at the front table & the cameras graced us with shots of the various 'smug' looks he had plastered across his face whenever somebody on stage looked down at him & brought him into their 'moment' on stage. He sat back in his chair like he was Omnipotent! It was sickening. I like Nicolson as an actor. I also believe he's a very shrewd business man. But let's get serious. If this movie was so great, why wasn't Nicolson up for best actor? That makes no sense! And, Scorsese seemed awkward on stage - I'm thinkin' he had to feel a tad out of place, suddenly, having to look into the faces of those directors he was up against who actually deserved to be in the best director category this year. The one other thing that made me lose complete respect for what the Golden Globes event represents, was Warren Beatty being honored. Let's see...he won 'best director' for REDS way back when...he's been in more forgettable films than memorable. He hasn't done anything in years, except get himself in the limelight hoping people actually believe he belongs in politics...for which he proved himself to be a big buffoon & that Tom Hanks found a way to make Beatty seem somehow amazing...well. that - alone -deserves some kind of awward! I'll say one thing for Nicolson...despite his 'better than thou' attitude, he has proved himself to be an excellent actor. That doesn't mean everything he's in is worthy of an award. It all makes sense to me now...Scorsese winning for \"Best Director,\" Nicolson behaving as if only a select two or three were worthy of his attention, and Beatty being honored...quite a threesome there.",

The film gets bogged down after the first act and Nicholson went from stellar to laughable (not to mention his accent disappeared halfway through the film). DiCaprio and Damon are the only real reason to see the film.

Even without watching Infernal Affairs which this was remade from, The Departed is a prolonged bizarre and trite 1 hour and 50 minutes. With wiseguy dialogues that run three words too long of a sentence, it also boasts senseless need of violence on screen. Do American cinema take a few steps backward every few years? The only reason why anyone would give this movie such praise is by just reviewing the credits and not watching it. Where Infernal Affairs was a well-paced film, this was, as one cinema-goer so well put it, \"all over the place.\" Thank you very much for wasting my weekend and also for proving once again, of all the fairness and realism placed in portraying every other race, the Chinese are still made to look like numbskulls who can't even speak their own language properly.",
