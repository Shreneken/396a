  "summary": "Darryl Edwards (Shawn Wayans) is so eager to become a father that he mistakes a short, baby-faced thief (Marlon Wayans) on the lam for an abandoned toddler. He and his wife take the \"baby\" into their home while the thief's partner (Morgan) tries to help him recover a stolen diamond.  (Sony Pictures)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Almost in spite of itself, Little Man manages to deliver big laughs. It's not enough to make it a consistently funny movie, but this one-trick pony from the Wayans brothers has flashes of humor and sincerity that almost save it from its disastrous ending.",
    "I laughed at the Wayanses' movie, and I don't even hate myself for it.",
    "An extremely broad and sometimes crude comedy.",
    "There's no question, though, that the Wayanses have dialed down the outrageousness to nearly sub-PG-13 levels.",
    "The slapstick is funnier for the nifty CGI, and the script gets in some sly digs at racist cops and multitasking soccer moms.",
    "I'd be lying if I said I didn't laugh at some of this--though it's not as funny as Laurel and Hardy as toddlers in \"Brats.\" But I wanted to slap myself whenever I did.",
    "Little Man only proves that some should just stick to the sketch comedy, and leave the big screen to \"Big Daddys\" like Adam Sandler who the critics tend to snub, but who know how to make an audience laugh.",
    "Little Man will probably satisfy fans of the Wayans.",
    "It took a century of innovation in the field of cinematic special effects, but finally the head of Marlon Wayans could be successfully grafted onto the body of a baby.",
    "It's seldom a good sign when a Rob Schneider cameo elevates a comedy, but Little Man aims so low and fires so often that it can't miss all the time.",
    "Yes, in this day and age, a tall man can pretend to be a very short man pretending to be a baby who uses his innocent disguise to molest women and whack men in the nuts. Isn't that funny? No, actually, not so much.",
    "At least \"White Chicks\" had a point behind the humor.",
    "Once the initial round of breast-feeding and rectal thermometer bits is fired off, the picture starts to give off the funky whiff of unattended Pampers.",
    "There are probably some moviegoers who can laugh at the sight of a groin-punching, breast-grabbing baby, possibly even find it cute. Everyone else should steer clear of Little Man, which welds Marlon Wayans' head to a diminutive body double, offering up the creepiest bigscreen dwarf since the last David Lynch movie.",
    "Devoid of verbal wit, instead relying on a relentless stream of Looney Tunes-inspired violence.",
    "Sexual and toilet humor plumb new depths in Keenen Ivory Wayans' Little Man, which will stink up theaters like several gross of dirty diapers.",
    "A bunch of gags, most of which you've seen in the trailer, strung together by any means necessary.",
    "Tedious.",
    "Somewhere within all the crude slapstick and crass stereotypes, Little Man operates as a vulgar burlesque on the crisis of African-American manhood, particularly the relationships, or lack thereof, between fathers and sons.",
    "Well, it was bound to happen: The Wayans brothers have made a movie that's even more two-dimensional than a cartoon.",
    "97% of the movie will make you need a shower. Possibly two.",
    "Little Man is putrid."
