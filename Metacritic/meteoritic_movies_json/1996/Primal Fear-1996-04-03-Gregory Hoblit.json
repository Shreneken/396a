Those questions aren't for high-powered Chicago attorney Martin Vail (Gere) to decide. His job is to defend - especially if a case will put his name in the headlines and further his career. When Vail hears that a penniless altar boy (Norton) is accused of murdering the local archbishop, he snaps up the case, eager for the media spotlight. Little does he know that it will uncover a viper's nest of corruption, pit him against a prosecutor (Linney) who's his ex-lover, and test all his skill, judgement and even his win-at-any-cost attitude.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "Riveting.",
    "The plot is as good as crime procedurals get, but the movie is really better than its plot because of the three-dimensional characters.",
    "A tight courtroom melodrama that serves up twist after twist like so many baffling knuckle balls, this film handles its suspenseful material with skill and style.",
    "A crackling courtroom drama with more twists than O.J. had alibis.",
    "This is the sort of movie that doesn't become irritating even when it's predictable.",
    "Gere taps into his charismatic-weasel mode, but director Gregory Hoblit fills the big screen with excellent TV actors (Andre Braugher, John Mahoney, Maura Tierney) and then gives them nothing interesting to do.",
    "Norton's performance and the well-paced tension preceding the movie's climactic sequence provide an entertaining if slightly predictable thriller.",
    "The sky-high sleaze quotient -- lascivious priests, amateur porn movies, teenage hustlers and institutionalized corruption of every kind -- ought to guarantee fun for all, but heavy messages keep poking through and spoiling everything.",
    "Despite high production standards and a slick advertising campaign, Primal Fear is as trite and routine as any made-for-TV courtroom drama.",
    "Semiabsorbing.",
    "The major jolt is saved for the very end but, like much else in the film, it is overexplained and underlined when more simplicity and quiet would have provided the revelation with the power of a depth charge.",
    "The special twist-which Paramount Pictures has implored critics not to divulge-redefines the story completely. It also ruins everything.",
    "The violent story is long on nastiness, short on credibility.",
    "You'd get more of a jolt from Angela Lansbury on \"Murder, She Wrote\" and more intellectual stimulation from a cozy game of Clue.",
    "It should have been sent straight to video. As a courtroom drama, it stumbles from one ludicrous howler to another. Were the movie's \"legal technical advisers\" on another planet while the  rest of the world was learning about legal procedure courtesy of the O.J. trial?"

Impeccable and commendable acting by Edward Norton! Richard Gere's style, relatively uncharacteristic and new in that era is equally immersive. The plot, storyline and execution is just brilliant! If you are a true cinephile, you will absolutely love this movie and appreciate the beauty of it. It goes much beyond a courtroom drama and is one of the gems of that era. Must watch for individuals who love crime thrillers, psychological thrillers and courtroom dramas. I will go as far as to say that the recent movies have been greatly \"inspired\" by the plot of this movie and copied a lot of it elements but none could execute it as brilliantly as Primal Fear did. The 10/10 is for the brilliant acting and the simple simple but impactful execution of the storyline.",

The case isBased on a best selling novel by William Diehl, Primal Fear stars Richard Gere, as a high powered defense attorney, who decides to take on what appears to be an open and shut case, just so he can get his face on Television. The case is intriguing and did what seldom movies can do, surprise me. There is an ending to this film that will just completely blow you away. As for the rest of the film, it was extremely entertaining thanks to the outstanding cast, that features both Richard Gere and a very young, Edward Norton, in one of his first roles. At the time Norton was a no-name, while Gere was the big star. Who would have thought that eventually Norton would become the bigger name? Well, anyone who saw this film and the absolutely tremendous performance Norton gives. To be honest, most court room dramas don't surprise me. You can always tell if the suspect is guilty or innocent, and there is usually some kind of twist in the story. Primal Fear was not so cut and dry, I kept going back and fourth on the suspects guilt or innocence myself. That's because this is a powerful movie, with an unrivaled cast, written by a professional novelist, as opposed to some amateur screenwriter. Primal Fear is a perfect example of what it takes to create a great movie, and after you watch it, let me know if you can figure out where the title comes from. It took me a while to get it, but eventually I did.",

What is different here? The case involves the Catholic Church (and that always attracts the audiences), the altar boy seems unable to hurt a fly and the lawyer seems pretty obnoxious most of the time.Richard Gere has played a good role in this film, one of the few decent roles in this actor's career to date, and has shown that he is a good, talented actor, who deserves better characters in the future. Perhaps even better was the performance of Edward Norton, in the role of the altar boy Aaron. He becomes so credible and sincere that we believe him to the end, and this only serves to make the end a twist even more amazing than it would be otherwise. That's enough for the movie to deserve a chance from the public.",

Surprisingly, none of his films ever contributed anything new to that genre. In fact, I am just gonna come out and say it, it never even delivered what is already out there, well and established. A film that is so textbook and standard in its approach towards the characters and their arcs and their characteristics, you'd hope for it to at least gift you what you expect. The director Gregory Holbit doesn't throw such parties. His parties are a celebration. Celebrations that are completely misinterpreted and misunderstood, in what makes a celebration.. well, a celebration- I cannot stop using the word, celebration.So how does a best selling novel, trending set of genre and an incredible cast prints a messy product out in the market? The answer is the laziness. Take the encounter of Frances McDormand and Laura Linney in the courtroom, later in the film. What should have been a hair pulling and nail biting scene, is instead played like a sloppy exhaustion of some labour work. The makers understands that antic smartly.But never thinks of earning that moment in any dimension. It is enjoying too much with its sassy attitude, gloating for that undeserved achievement- at least that is what comes off in the end- to ever cast an impact. Which by the way, also turns out to be the role of Richard Gere as a complex lawyer in the film. He is enjoying too much to make you care for him and to add more into his troubles, he doesn't particularly have the most empathetic role in this case. Primal Fear will always be a symbol for seizing an opportunity to me, Edward Norton never lets go of his insatiable Joker-alike dual persona on the screen; it didn't speak to me as well as it did to others, but it definitely marked him on the map.",
