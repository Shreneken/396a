That common-man hero was James J. Braddock, a.k.a. the \"Cinderella Man\"-who was to become one of the most surprising and inspirational sports legends in history.  (Universal Pictures)… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "At last, his (Howard's) first great (and filling) movie--inspirational, yes, but far from hokey; moving, absolutely, but never saccharine; and gripping, despite its being a fixed fight.",
    "Cinderella Man is not a movie about boxing, but about this boxer who personified the heart and hope of 1935.",
    "In sum, the classical Ron Howard and his splendid cast have made a spellbinding movie that joins \"Million Dollar Baby,\" as well as \"Raging Bull,\" the first two \"Rocky\" pictures, and \"Fat City\" as one of boxing cinema's all-time heavyweight champs.",
    "A premier boxing movie and a forceful Depression remembrance for the socially conscious, Cinderella Man also ices it for stargazers that Russell Crowe is the dominant screen actor working today.",
    "An unflinching and historically rich rendering of an amazing story. He has made what is easily the best American film so far this year.",
    "Ron Howard and Russell Crowe bring the Braddock story to vivid life in a superbly acted, beautifully shot, highly engaging drama that ranks as one of Howard's best efforts.",
    "An exquisite ode to a working-class hero, Cinderella Man takes the almost impossibly perfect elements of the saga of underdog boxer James J. Braddock and fills it with emotional gravitas, wrenching danger and a panoramic sense of American life during the Great Depression.",
    "It's an eye-filling, sumptuously detailed historical epic that grandly re-creates the bloody gladiatorial spectacles and smoke-filled, spit-flying, claustrophobically crowded arenas of its bygone era.",
    "It's the classic American tale of the family man triumphant, and Howard makes sure that it hits you right in the heart.",
    "Smashing, supremely engrossing picture.",
    "A broad, foursquare piece of populist filmmaking that happens to be tremendously moving.",
    "Jim Braddock is almost transparent in the simple goodness of his character; that must have made him almost impossible to play. Russell Crowe makes him fascinating, and it takes a moment of two of thought to appreciate how difficult that must have been.",
    "How exceptional a film actor is Russell Crowe? So exceptional that in Cinderella Man, he makes a good boxing movie feel at times like a great, big picture.",
    "It's a crowd-pleasing, artful and convincing movie that just misses being great but nevertheless gratifies.",
    "Giamatti has his hands full trying to keep us from thinking about Burgess Meredith.",
    "Delivers old-fashioned, \"Shawshank Redemption\"-style entertainment.",
    "As a history lesson (Depression 101), Cinderella Man feels a bit secondhand. As a true-grit tale of redemption, however, it lands one solid body punch after another.",
    "It runs roughly two and a half hours, and the intensity spikes with every fight; without Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, however, it would be flat on the canvas. They make it seem a better and more bristling film than it actually is.",
    "The film is most significantly about puzzled people trying to comprehend the cosmic reversal of fortune that was the Depression.  They don't have much more than raw courage and simple virtues to rely on. Unlike most period pieces, Cinderella Man encourages us to fondly recall not songs or clothes but values we have largely mislaid.",
    "Despite the tale's dusty pedigree, Ron Howard spins a ticket-worthy two-plus hours of movie-movie entertainment.",
    "Lacking a more specific sense of time and place, Cinderella Man leans heavily on the technically proficient Crowe to slip into Braddock's skin, but he can only do so much with a character who's ready to be mounted in bronze over Central Park.",
    "What keeps \"Cinderella\" from complete hokiness is Crowe's utterly believable performance.",
    "Lightly stained a nicotine brown and topped by two male actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans, the film is as calculating and glossy a hard-luck tale as any cooked up on the old M-G-M lot.",
    "Cinderella Man's key emotional moments feel as if they've been predigested for an audience that can't be trusted to feel things for itself but needs to be firmly albeit lovingly pointed in the appropriate direction.",
    "Howard manipulates audiences without guile, jerking tears, piling on catastrophes, smoothing out dissonances, making bad characters badder and good ones gooder--and clearly believing that this is wholesome. At what he does, he's peerless. I wish I had more respect for what he does--and for myself the next morning for surrendering.",
    "With all that going for it, one must ask, why didn't they just tell it completely straight? In other words, why did they feel so compelled to create an utterly bogus Max Baer for the virtuous Jim to fight in the movie's admittedly compelling climactic, championship bout?",
    "Crowe is, in his unique way, astonishing. Even at his biggest moments he seems both convincing and somewhat reticent.",
    "The performances do shine out through this dramatic miasma.",
    "With the notable exception of Martin Scorsese's opus, most boxing flicks suffer form a certain amount of raw-boned sentimentality, the sort of easy melodrama that pits naive underdogs against corrupt overlords, or age against youth, or purity against prejudice. Even the recent \"Million Dollar Baby\" succumbed in the final act. But this one, where \"Rocky\" meets \"The Waltons,\" has us reeling under its saccharine weight.",
    "Overlong and unevenly paced, Cinderella Man hits stretches (especially between bouts) when it threatens to lose its audience.",
    "Ron Howard, an exemplar of honorable mediocrity, reunites with actor Russell Crowe and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman of \"A Beautiful Mind\" for this epic treatment of a seven-year stretch (1928-'35) in the career of New Jersey boxer James J. Braddock.",
    "The movie is calamitously miscast.",
    "Viewers who remember Max Baer may, however, take issue with the way the film treats this charismatic fighter. In 1933, Baer became an important symbol of Jewish strength when he faced off against Hitler's favored fighter, Max Schmeling, and while reducing Baer to a bloodthirsty villain makes it easier to root for Braddock, it's an unfair bit of character assassination.",
    "Without Crowe and Paul Giamatti, this movie would have little in its corner.",
    "Ultimately, it's Paul Giamatti (\"Sideways\"), playing Braddock's manager Joe Gould, who shines. In another actor's hands, Gould would be a secondary character lost in Crowe's shadow, but Giamatti outshines his co-stars at times with his everyman looks and delivery.",
    "He's a saint in the flesh, but not one who inspires great drama.",
    "Ron Howard's bio-pic is an Oscar-baiting fairy tale that manipulates the audience at every turn of the clich.",
    "There's no irony within the film, but there's a whopping irony surrounding it. Just as Star Wars has finally ended, Rocky seems to be starting all over again.",
    "Cinderella Man is ostensibly the kind of old-fashioned drama that sends audiences home with a satisfied glow. But like so many of Howard's movies, there's something canned and phony about it -- it left me feeling cooked and dehydrated, as if I'd fallen asleep on a tanning bed."

It is obvious Ron Howard and Russell Crowe know the strengths and weaknesses of the other. Together they have made one of the few movies that makes one want to stand and cheer the leading character. The only issue that made watching this movie difficult is the knowledge of Crowe's \"off screne\" persona. Though we hypothetically are to leave such info outside the door, nevertheless, watching him reach deep as Braddock to fight for his family's survival only conjurs up his real-life tempermental outbursts. If someone could have exercised these images from my head I would have become enraputred by this film's story. A-list stars must realize that with such an instrusive papparazi, their public behaviors can easily snake their way into their roles, in a distracting manner. God!

It portrays the struggle of living in America during the Great Depression and reveals the triumphant live of boxer James Braddock. Russell Crowe plays the roll of a compassionate husband and father so well that I wish I had him as an uncle. despite being a feirce boxing champion he does not give off the impression of being a meat-head, testosterone driven bulldog. His ethical and tranquil character is what makes the film which totally contradicts the stereotypical boxer. Another twist that i loved about the film is when he goes broke and goes the to boxing confederation to beg for enough money to get his kids back. that was a really moving scene. although i loved the movie i thought the actress playing James Braddock's wife could of been a little more attractive, boxers usually have HOT wives and they are always enjoyable to watch, especially when they play the roll of a faithful and caring wife.",

Now, the film is certainly familiar at times, but thanks to a powerhouse performance from Russell Crowe and great direction from Ron Howard, it still feels fresh and new. In addition, the set design for 1930s New York/New Jersey is great and feels very authentic. Ultimately, the film is incredibly inspirational, touching, moving, and will have you rooting for Braddock from your couch, even if you know what the end result will be. Thus, in that way, this one reminds you of the magic of film, as even though it may not be the most technically brilliant film or the best one ever, it makes you care and feel something even when you know what is coming next due to the type of film it is.

Its undoubtedly a bleak watch at times but I liked seeing how James Braddock reacted to things, criticism by others and how he clearly loved his children and did all he could to provide for his family.The film title refers to the nickname he was given, as he managed to regain his former glory but the question is, of course, at what cost?. I remember one character also made the point that (in relation to his nickname) \"people die in fairy tales all the time\".Certainly this film highlights that the serious effects of concussion were at least starting to be noticed back in the time its set in, with other competitors knocking people out, who didn't recover. That made me think of the more recent film 'Concussion' with Will Smith, which goes into this subject more deeply, although in that film its directly related to American Football, rather than boxing.I felt Renee Zellweger gave a particularly good performance in this film, as Mae Braddock, who clearly was deeply concerned for the health and future of her husband and father to her children. I doubt many people couldn't feel her concern and frustration for him through Renee's performance.Overall this is an interesting sport related biopic/drama film. I wouldn't say its especially memorable but Russell Crowe is on good form and I'd say its certainly worth a watch, so yes, I would recommend it.",
