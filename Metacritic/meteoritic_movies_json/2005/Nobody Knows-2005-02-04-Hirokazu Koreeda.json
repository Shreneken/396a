  "critic_reviews": [
    "Yagira's performance is so extraordinary, it won him the best actor prize at the 2004 Cannes film festival.",
    "Nobody Knows, by the often excellent Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda, is one of those special movies that can give us a new way of seeing.",
    "The film, winsome and tragic at once and finely attuned to the rhythms of childhood, always seems quite close to real life.",
    "[The children's] remarkable lack of self-consciousness ... and Kore-eda's quasi-documentary style give this movie a stunning credibility.",
    "It's a quietly powerful work, pulsing with gentle humor and a gripping sense of imminent calamity and dread.",
    "Beautiful, elevating and achingly sad.",
    "Moves at a stately pace; it's a long film, to boot. But there's real drama and pathos in the story, in the blend of matter-of-factness and potential catastrophe, in the depiction of innocence imperiled.",
    "Yuya Yagira, winner of the best actor award at Cannes this year, is superb as the protective eldest child; he and his other nonprofessional costars are quietly heartbreaking.",
    "Not for the faint of heart, though it has no scenes of overt violence, and barely a tear is shed. It is also strangely thrilling, not only because of the quiet assurance of Mr. Kore-eda's direction, but also because of his alert, humane sense of sympathy.",
    "Unfolds with such leisurely, terrible beauty, it takes a while to realize that what we are witnessing is the children's long slide into beggary, exacerbated by the slow torture of faint hope.",
    "Pure and universal.",
    "The kids in Nobody Knows are most decidedly not crazy, and we come to care for them to an almost excruciating degree.",
    "Nobody Knows is the rare film that successfully tells its tale of childhood from the childrenâ€™s point of view.",
    "Kore-eda presents the deeply moving story in a documentary style that is both gentle and compelling.",
    "Spare and elegant and harrowing, it's an ode to childhood trust being stretched until it snaps.",
    "There are moments in Yagira's performance that will break your heart.",
    "Nothing short of mesmerizing.",
    "Kore-eda expresses the terror of the kids' predicament with a touch that's equally tender and dispassionate.",
    "You won't forget Nobody Knows, the quietly harrowing tale of four abandoned Japanese children.",
    "Kore-eda sketches the inner, spiritual and emotional lives of the children with subtlety and sensitivity, delivering the goods after a seemingly directionless first half.",
    "I certainly came out of Nobody Knows feeling numb; only later, reflecting on the fact that the movie was inspired by a true story, did it occur to me that the numbness could have been deliberate, and that what suffused this picture was a mist of anger.",
    "It's a heart-sundering vision of preadolescent helplessness that rivals passages of \"Landscape in the Mist\" and \"Ponette.\"",
    "Loosely structured around four seasons, Nobody Knows unfolds in a long series of episodes that slowly progress from lightly comic to bracingly sad as the situation deteriorates.",
    "Japanese auteur Hirokazu Kore-eda's most accessible film to date is also his most wrenching.",
    "Kore-eda doesn't create the simultaneous sense of being destroyed and exalted that the greatest humanist movies do, but he's stayed true to his title.",
    "There is not much progress in the film: actions are repeated and repeated...Yet the film is sustained--and, for the most part, well sustained--by the children.",
    "A beautiful but depressing film.",
    "Excellent, troubling social commentary based on a true story.",
    "Luminous, melancholy and ultimately heartbreaking.",
    "Beguiling but long-winded."

In Nobody Knows, Four children are left to fend for themselves when their mother takes off. The eldest son, Akira, is left in charge of his younger sisters and brother. He is forced to \"grow up\" and take charge  but can only do so much. Hirokazu Kore-eda's cinematic progression and pacing is slow but riveting. It's a quiet film, yet spilling over with emotion. It's a comment on society and family. It reflects the status and shows us a cinematic situation of child abandonment  it's not just a \"pointless\" and \"boring\" film. The kids act like kids. It's moving and eye-opening. As I say about all movies: Don't go in with expectations. Be surprised, entertained, and enlightened!",

The abandonment and the 'fending for themselves' is interesting, but it's half shot like a documentary, half shot like a progressive drama.  But there's very little to take from the film.  The characters are pretty shallow, despite the great acting  and close-up shots.  A movie this reminded me a lot of is King Of the Hill, a fantastically made movie about a boy left to fend for himself as his parents have to leave.  There's adventure, a coming-of-age character arc, a plot with strong overtones.  Very strongly written characters in addition to the good cast.  Obviously they're not identical films, but I would recommend King Of The Hill tenfold over this.  I'm a hugely into Asian cinema, but other than good camerawork, there's very little to this film.",

For There's a thin line between whether the movie is too long or not. Initially, I felt the same way too. But as I watched the second half, i realised what the seemingly nonsensical scenes are for - for the viewers to think and reflect. For those who lament that the show has no ending, think again. Remember why akira did not want to go to the public welfare? because he didn't want to be separated from his siblings. and the movie ended timely, and unfortunately, with the departure of yuki. If they hang on the way they are, they will be separated eventually as well, perhaps in a worse manner - death. towards the end of the show, arika approached saki whom he rejected earlier for help. he did not want saki's money initially because he believed it is against his principle. but he realises in the end that when faced with the harsh reality of face, we have to compromise our beliefs. akira has learnt a lesson - he will approach the welfare public authority. at the end of the show, shigeta (i can't remember the name of arika's brother) found a coin remember? it symbolises new hope for the children.",

The movie is well acted and directed. There is no wasted This movie is strangely mesmerizing and heartbreaking. There was no drama, no crying in the movie but I have endured one of the most intensely painful experience. Powerful movie!!! The movie is well acted and directed. There is no wasted moment in the whole 141 minutes. Every scene is well chosen and has its own effect to the audiences. There are some silent scenes in which the camera just stays still, capturing the very normal, unnoticed things of their life; and these scenes are precious. The ones who call this movie \"boring\" watch too many typical, bomb-blowing, gun-firing Hollywood drama. The repetition of the film IS THE POINT!!! That's how life is. Look at your life for a second. Is that what life is, a series of repetitive thing: we get up in the morning, we eat breakfast, we go to work/ school, and then we go home, we have dinner, we sleep and then we wake up again the next morning. These children and their life is portrayed beautifully real. It is NOT BORING!!! It is mesmerizing and heartbreaking. Those who say it boring, again, watch too much cheesy Hollywood film. What do they expect? A car accident? A gun-fire? A murder? The thieves get in to their apartment? Look at your life. These things don't come around as often as they do in Hollywood films. This movie is emotionally exhausted but it is never a waste to experience something like this. POWERFUL. Oh, and to Potechi who finds it is unbelievable to have a junior high/ high school outsider join the kids, I just want to say that for me, it is totally believable. You cannot use your cynical, protective, and doubtful sense of the adult to try to make sense the kid's world. Look at the details in the movie or the children who play at any park in real life. They play together. They laugh together. Only the adults are the one who are lonely, cynical, isolated and masked. The movie is utterly real and precious. A MUST SEE. What you experience in the movie maybe is what the four kids are experiencing themselves. The movie puts you in their life and make you experience it. So if you feel mind-numbing or bored or curious (about the mother) or heartbroken or emotionally drained or repressed, I think it would probably be what the children are enduring. Hope you will appreciate it.",

Yuya Yagira's performance as Akira is perfect, hence why he won Best Actor. The young Akira's eyes change throughout the movie, from the innocence at the beginning to the hard, mournful look at the end. We see the mother's (who is played by You, a Japanese Pop Star) true personality when she questions Akira why she cannot be happy. This is the final tie cut between the two, and you can see it. I honestly think the flow of this movie makes you forget that it is over 2 hours long. In the middle of the movie, we can see that Akira's frustration gets the best of him when he pushes Shigeru away for the first time. In all honesty, this movie shows the pain and hardships of life through the eyes of children. That is what makes this movie so great. It makes us re-think ourselves and our beliefs.",
