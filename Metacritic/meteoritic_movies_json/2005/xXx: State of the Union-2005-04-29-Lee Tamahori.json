  "critic_reviews": [
    "This is a B movie rooted in gut-level stirrings of power and retaliation.",
    "What's fun is that the road to that climactic Capitol showdown is paved with one ridiculous and relentlessly edited set piece after another.",
    "A smooth blend of visual special effects, exceptional stunts, fluid photography, sharp design and a possible best-selling soundtrack.",
    "Opens explosively and never lets up.",
    "There are really only two kinds of big-budget action movies: stupid, and good and stupid. Surprisingly, XXX: State of the Union is good and stupid, which makes it an immediate improvement over 2002's meatheaded \"XXX.\"",
    "Theater of the absurd, masquerading as an action thriller.",
    "Thankfully, State Of The Union's pulpy, adrenalized blaxploitation spin on the secret-agent genre provides the dumb fun its predecessor should have dished out.",
    "Most of the movie is standard action fare, but the political commentary is interesting when it's allowed to surface.",
    "Basically the first movie all over again, with plenty more of the bridge-jumping, rocket-launching action that audiences loved about the original.",
    "You'd half expect the Xbox logo to pop up on the credit roll for XXX: State of the Union, since what's on view is closer to a videogame than a movie. While that will be music to the ears of young gamers, it's noise to anyone hoping for a coherent action movie.",
    "At least this movie seems more aware of its trashiness than \"National Treasure\" was. It's therefore freer to have some off-the-cuff fun the way Steven Seagal's more tolerable vehicles once did.",
    "A big, loud, proudly brainless popcorn flick that blows up cars, trucks, tanks, boats, helicopters and even a train.",
    "This is a movie about guns blazing, men punching, speedometers straining and explosions exploding. On all those levels, it succeeds just fine - which makes for a great amusement-park ride, but perhaps not much of a movie.",
    "Hilariously, gut-bustingly, mind-blowingly, jaw-droppingly stupid.",
    "Director Lee Tamahori (Die Another Day) has a shruggingly action-intensive style, which feels at once heavy-handed and lazy.",
    "Of course the movie's real raison d'etre is watching Ice Cube tear up government facilities and blockades with a tank, spout Schwarzenegger-style kiss-off lines, and commandeer the kind of babes and high-tech cars that James Bond usually plays with.",
    "It's even louder and dumber than the first XXX, but if watching things fall down and go boom in a very big way makes you cheer, you're in luck.",
    "Thankfully, there's the relatively-charismatic and cheeky Ice Cube hogging the lens.",
    "The winking title X Cubed somehow eluded the makers of this sequel, along with plot coherency, character development, or clever explosions of genre convention.",
    "What isn't scary--or exciting, amusing or fun--is XXX: State of the Union, a movie so preposterous, cliché-packed and over the top that it makes the original \"XXX\" seem as good as the original \"State of the Union.\"",
    "One can give Ice Cube props for attitude, but not much more.",
    "The special effects excite at first but wear out their welcome.",
    "Loud, dumb and obnoxious.",
    "10 times too much, a nonstop orgy of bullets, bombs, and booty that aims low and hits the bull’s-eye with enough firepower to sink the Bismarck.",
    "Has to be one of the most absurd of all big-budget action movies, and that's saying something. It's just a blink away from over-the-top self-parody, and I'm pretty sure it's not trying to be.",
    "Critics are inclined to describe the action in films like \"XXX\" and Lee Tamahori's sequel, XXX: State of the Union, as \"cartoon violence.\" I'll resist doing that out of respect for cartoons.",
    "The most gratifying thing about xXx: State of the Union is that nobody wastes much time on character, motivation, plausibility, dialogue or sex -- all that slow stuff that drags down ordinary movies.",
    "The makers of State of the Union subscribe to the Jerry Bruckheimer big-bang theory of action (big, bigger, biggest), but they don't share that maestro's attention to detail, or apparently his deep pockets. The state of this cinematic union is shabby indeed.",
    "So primitive, it must have been written in lizard blood on animal skin.",
    "Appalling sequel.",
    "How bad does it get? How far past the basement can one elevator go?"
