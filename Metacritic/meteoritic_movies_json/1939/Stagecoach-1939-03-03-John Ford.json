  "critic_reviews": [
    "Stagecoach holds our attention effortlessly and is paced with the elegance of a symphony.",
    "Here, in a sentence, is a movie of the grand old school, a genuine rib-thumper and a beautiful sight to see.",
    "The classic western, Stagecoach is one of John Ford's greatest frontier epics.",
    "Stagecoach gives fine shading to a simple story, making it look and feel like a forgotten American myth.",
    "Stagecoach both revived and elevated the Western.",
    "What drew the crowds back in 1939 and what has kept them coming is not the film's simmering subtexts but the absolutely fantastic ambush sequence as the stage thunders across the salt flats of Monument Valley. With this, Ford transformed the western.",
    "The contrast between the innocence of the wilderness and the ambiguous 'blessings of civilisation' are brilliantly stitched into a smoothly developed narrative, which climaxes with the famous Indian attack on the stagecoach.",
    "Action-packed and jaw-droppingly epic (it was the first time director John Ford ever shot in Monument Valley), Stagecoach is the perfect Western to show to people who don’t like Westerns.",
    "Stagecoach remains a tale for our times.",
    "If this is the Old West of our dreams, it’s one that exists in an outsider’s limbo, away from society’s rules, alternating between the breathtaking breadth of the American landscape and the Germanically shadowy lighting of Ford’s claustrophobic interiors.",
    "Sweeping and powerful drama of the American frontier, Stagecoach displays potentialities that can easily drive it through as one of the surprise big grossers of the year. Without strong marquee names, picture nevertheless presents wide range of exploitation to attract, and will carry far through word-of-mouth after it gets rolling.",
    "Certainly it's the weakest of Ford's major westerns, burdened with a schematic and pretentious Dudley Nichols script (the \"cross section of society\" on board the stagecoach), but its virtues remain intact."
