  "summary": "A human drama about the struggle of a true genius, inspired by events in the life of John Forbes Nash, Jr.  [Universal Pictures]",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Inspiring and largely unsentimental, this is as much a love story as a tale of courage.",
    "Crowe brings the character to life by sidestepping sensationalism and building with small behavioral details.",
    "It's everything most movies this year have not been: deeply felt, genuine, gracious.",
    "Sadly, Howard blands out in the final third, using old-age makeup and tear-jerking to turn a tough true story into something easily digestible. Until then, you'll be riveted.",
    "So many things come together so beautifully in this movie based on the life of John Forbes Nash Jr. that you're likely to find yourself willing to benignly overlook its occasional biographical lapses and narrative sweetening.",
    "Gripping, smart and moving, without falling prey to sentimentality, it shows what can be achieved when mainstream filmmakers like Howard and Goldsman are genuinely inspired and determined to be honest.",
    "Howard has never been so grown-up in his handling of tough themes or so inventive in depicting states of mind. Goldsman has never been so down-to-earth or created so touching a character.",
    "The kind of expression of emotion that touches a deeper chord.",
    "This is one inspiring movie despite extremely tricky subject matter -- better than \"Shine\" and among the most affecting ever made about co-existing with mental demons.",
    "Though the role might seem a real stretch for an actor who just won an Oscar for his Charlton Heston turn as Maximus in \"Gladiator,\" he and the movie ace the test.",
    "Crowe sometimes summons up one of the most powerful depictions of mental illness I have ever seen with barely an eyelid flicker separating manifestations of sickness from utterly sane displays of creative concentration.",
    "It's an absorbing, progressively unsettling and ultimately very inspiring biographical reflection that, in the interest of creating its subject's internal landscape, plays some chilling tricks on its audience.",
    "As Nash gets closer to Crowe's own age (and level of dissipation), the performance settles down and becomes first credible and then overwhelming. This is a stupendous piece of acting.",
    "Consistently engrossing as an unusual character study and as a trip to the mysterious border-crossing between rarified brilliance and madness, this serious-minded but lively film is distinguished by an exceptional performance by Russell Crowe.",
    "A greatly ambitious undertaking, but from the commercial point of view quite insane. The movie is ridiculously fragile: It's like a Faberge egg, and even a twitch of foreknowledge will destroy the magic of the movie utterly.",
    "Director Ron Howard's deftness in suggesting the subjective experience of Crowe's character, who's later diagnosed with schizophrenia, makes for inspirational narrative.",
    "What began as a bold and thrilling story descends into Hollywood clich√©. But Crowe and Connelly's work rises above the mush. They make A Beautiful Mind go.",
    "This is another brilliant performance by Crowe, who is to body language what Meryl Streep is to accents.",
    "While I don't doubt that Howard's done the best he can, it's sad to see a beautiful mind whittled down by such a plain one.",
    "It's doubly frustrating that after flirting with (and even upending) biopic conventions for much of its length, A Beautiful Mind finally gives in to them so readily.",
    "There is more to admire in A Beautiful Mind than you might suspect, but less than its creators believe. When the film does succeed, it almost seems to do so despite itself.",
    "The success of this effect, which helps elevate the movie above a classy disease-of-the-week saga, rests firmly on Russell Crowe's performance, and it's a strikingly good and moving one.",
    "The movie can -- indeed, should -- be intellectually rejected, but you can't quite banish it from your mind.",
    "Instead of an originally conceived movie that reflects Nash's troubled but brilliant mind, we have one of those formulaically rendered Important Subject movies -- the kind that seem exclusively designed for Best Picture nominations.",
    "While it's a splendidly acted film, A Beautiful Mind is also a wasted opportunity.",
    "Crowe understands what's interesting about Nash: He's not a feel-good figure. It's a pity the same can't be said for Howard.",
    "Aside from all the known material on public record the filmmakers chose not to use, Howard isn't even capable of believably bringing this off.",
    "It's not just our emotions that are being played on here, it's not just our intelligence being insulted because of Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman's presumption that we won't have any interest in a character whom it's not always possible to like. It's John Nash's life, being turned into an Oscar machine and an easy way to jerk tears."

It portrays the mentally ill as violent and the mental health world as an incompetent sham of an institution.

It's not impossible to think that the mentally ill were further stigmatized and slandered by this astronomically overstated portrayal of both schizophrenia and John Nash's own experience with it. It's so mind-bendingly insensitive and callous to its source material that it's an unrestrained travesty that it exists, much less win eight Oscars. It shamelessly deceives solely for that purpose alone. Deserves no praise, since it is all manufactured exclusively for that.",

Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly were the worst choices for these roles. This movie can't even make proper use of its very flawed script. A child's game in the world of politics and scientists. Everything in it seems too artificial.There is no positive point in this picture except an incomplete explain of a messy story. The ending of the film is awful and tries to deceive the audience. As the opening of the film is more awful and we don't know what kind of person we are facing. In my opinion, if Russell Crowe did not act in the movie and only read the dialogues, the result would be much, much better.

This was pure Hollywood at its most digestible. Whether or not one believes the circulated rumours that the movie left out the nastier details of Nash's life one still has the nagging feeling throught that one is being spoonfed baby food. The film is contrived in every way, as if Ron Howard sat back and said, \"Now what will it take to win the Oscar,\" and then mapped out the film. Look, if we want to be honest, there's nothing -wrong- with a crowd pleaser. And that is what this film, like Gladiator, like Titanic, and numerous other Oscar winners, sets out to do. It's less a piece of art than pop culture, the current in thing to fit the public's current mood. So, though one might be entertained, those of us who believe movies should be more than just entertainment are left with a nagging, empty feeling after watching it, that is hard to explain. After all, a movie that is calculated to please, should please everyone, shouldn't it? I guess not after all. I won't comment on Russel Crowe's performance. I've seen better, I've seen worse. I will comment on Jennifer Connelly's, which I thought was awful. I can't to save my life understand why so many people, including the Oscar voters, were so blown away. She seems best skilled at just standing there and trying to look pretty and confounded, eyes sparkling. Yaaaaawwwn. She's not acting in this movie, she's modeling.

Yes, Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, and Paul Bettany, are all great here and in general, but holy cow does Russell Crowe stand tall. Truly a masterful performance from Crowe, his performance makes the film, though the film  itself is certainly interesting. Ron Howard's direction is typically strong here and he does a good job telling the story of famed mathematician John Nash. However, where this film is most strong in terms of story is in its telling of Nash's struggle with schizophrenia. In a way, it really opens your eyes as to how it is to live with schizophrenia and suffering through the delusions associated with it. In a sense, this is one of the better films on mental disease ever made as it paints a very real, distressing, and disturbing portrait, all of which make you appreciate the genius of Nash all the more.",

But I believe Nesh himself was not aware of that. He was a genius, but for mathematics, not for social sciences. Because of this essential prove he made, he came into a strong CIA and FBI focus as a serious threat for American system. It is a terrible shame what they did to him (giving him \"top-secret tasks\", following him to see if he has contacts with USSR, and finally taking him into mental intuition. (would a normal society take its famous scientist into a mad-house during his lectures to a distinguished audience given in a distinguished place?). Nesh has always been a true patriot, but nevertheless CIA/FBI doubted him and made him really suffer.

On one hand, that is because of truly Oscar-worthy filmmaking in every possible aspect, but on the other, graver hand, this is due to it introducing a mass audience to mental disorders. As all but an expert on this topic, I'm in no position to assess whether the film is realistic and respectful to actual patients, but bringing people closer to the minds of schizophrenics and other mentally ill by making a star-studded Hollywood film out of their perspective is rating praise already. Ron Howard realized a great mixture of drama, romance, action, and humour with A Beautiful Mind, something many directors attempt to do nowadays, clearly resulting from the award-winning prospect it brings along, but only very few succeed in. Story-wise, the film is immensely entertaining, touching, and just as beautiful as its title suggests. Another major merit of the four-time Oscar winner is its lead actor Russell Crowe, going from heroic action star in Gladiator to socially awkward genius in just two years. Thus, A Beautiful Mind is a more than deserving Best Picture winner at the Oscars and a film worth watching more than once.",

I confess I did not know him until I saw the film, but I found it interesting how he tells his life, using his life's adventures to make the story more appealing to the public. Not everything the film shows is exactly true but if we except the writer's creative and narrative freedoms, the film is close enough to reality for a biopic. Russel Crowe plays the protagonist, and he does it in a generally good way.
