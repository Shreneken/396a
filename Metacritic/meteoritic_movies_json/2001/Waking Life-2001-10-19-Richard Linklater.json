  "summary": "In this animated drama, a man walks through what may be a dream, flowing in and out of scenarios and encounters with strange characters.  (Fox Searchlight)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The film is truly special, truly different -- a wondrous talky roundelay about and for people who love life.",
    "An amazing thing -- a work of cinematic art in which form and structure pursues the logic-defying (parallel) subjects of dreaming and moviegoing.",
    "An astounding, one-of-a-kind movie.",
    "If there is justice in this world, this is the movie that will get people talking again about the excitement of film.",
    "I have seen Waking Life three times now. I want to see it again -- not to master it, or even to remember it better, --  but simply to experience all of these ideas, all of this passion, the very act of trying to figure things out.",
    "A smart cartoon about the life of the mind. It's about the fuzzy border between dreaming and living. It's thoughtful, provocative, liberating and fun.",
    "Not only does this film make you think, it makes you want to think. Few films -- few works of art of any stripe -- can claim that.",
    "Intriguing, arresting, delightfully refusing to be pigeonholed.",
    "A beautiful display of celluloid bungee-jumping.",
    "So verbally dexterous and visually innovative that you can't absorb it unless you have all your wits about you. And even then, you may want to see it again to enjoy its subtle humor and warm humanity.",
    "One of the most inspired cases of the medium embodying the message ever captured on celluloid.",
    "That Linklater pulls off the innovative feat with hypnotic assurance is nothing short of amazing.",
    "It's the perfect marriage of music and animated movement. But even when there's no music playing in Waking Life, the movie's lyricism is sustained by the way it looks and feels.",
    "Exciting and innovative feature.",
    "A smart, sensuous and sensory mind trip that caroms around a universe of thought.",
    "Linklater's ravishing new movie represents a bold leap into the possibilities of technology.",
    "The effect is dazzlingly beautiful and surreal.",
    "The pictures are gorgeous, and the words, well, if you listen hard enough, the words say exactly what one needs to hear: that is, to wake up and live.",
    "A breakthrough animated film -- a trippy cross between \"Yellow Submarine\" and \"My Dinner With Andre\" that will leave some audience members struggling to stay awake and others reaching for a toke.",
    "Few American filmmakers put more faith in the ability of words to stimulate mind and heart.",
    "Might have been unbearable if Linklater hadn't filled it with so much self-deprecating humor, undercutting the pretentiousness whenever it threatens to become too thick.",
    "Audiences looking for something fresh and different, not to mention a head trip, will find it in Waking Life.",
    "While much of the film is as scattershot as life itself, there are a few superb sequences involving lucid dreaming that really get down to business.",
    "Individual artists were assigned their own characters and given free rein -- characters and locations shift on a dime from naturalistic to baroque -- with the result that the movie's formal imagination surpasses and redeems the banal tedium of some of the dialogue.",
    "I'd like to think it's all a joke, that far from a dream this is actually Linklater's idea of a nightmare.",
    "It's a cult movie in search of a cult. It'll probably find one. It certainly looks and feels like no other movie ever made.",
    "Leaves an impression, while its specifics fade almost immediately.",
    "Waking Life doesn't leave you in a dream, specifically the dream of Linklater's previous films, so much as it traps you in an endless bull session.",
    "All talk and no action. Never, however, has pedantic navel-gazing been so beautifully drawn."

I watched it every night before I went to bed for about 3 months, until I let someone borrow it and they lost it. It really opens your mind and your eyes to the simple truths of life and existence. From scenes of optimism to existentialism, there is a story for every type of perspective. One of my favorite quotes from the movie: \"Hey. Could we do that again? I know we haven't met, but I don't want to be an ant. You know? I mean, it's like we go through life with our antennas bouncing off one another, continuously on ant autopilot, with nothing really human required of us. Stop. Go. Walk here. Drive there. All action basically for survival. All communication simply to keep this ant colony buzzing along in an efficient, polite manner. \"Here's your change.\" \"Paper or plastic?' \"Credit or debit?\" \"You want ketchup with that?\" I don't want a straw. I want real human moments. I want to see you. I want you to see me. I don't want to give that up. I don't want to be ant, you know?\"",

You see the boy passively interacting with the people he meets and having conversations with them. Billions of contradictory ideas are expressed. Everything shifts and wobbles. The director has captured what a real dream feels like. Pointless, confusing and weird. The animation is fluid and the art style works well. Later in the film, the boy is less passive and at one point has a full-blown conversation with a figure in the dream. Overall, an interesting, thought-provoking and entertaining experiment.",

Delving into subjects like the meaning of life, dreaming, the nature of dreams, the nature of the human experience, and philosophy, Waking Life somehow manages to be completely clear and focused in the message it is delivering. What that message is, however, is completely open to interpretation. A dear friend of mine who turned me on to the movie described it as this, and I can't think of a better explanation of Waking Life: \"I guess it is fun when being real is just a dream, and as valid as waking up from one.\"",

But for me, someone with a major interest in  philosophy who's really familiar with a lot of these topics, this film really hits you over the head in an uncomfortable way. It's just the character walking from one giant mouth of a character to another, listening to their didactic rambling about introductory philosophical debates that really fall flat if you know the background to each of the fragments. Linklater might as well have written a series of short essays on philosophy, because that's really all he does here. No true message, no philosophical thought left to the viewer, just a series of disconnected moments that don't really offer any sort of deeper meaning. I enjoy the visuals of the film, but everything about the writing comes off as sloppy, preachy, and far too heavy-handed for my taste. Maybe my opinion will change with further viewings, but after my first viewing, I'd much rather watch a truly cerebral film that doesn't spoonfeed you ideas, and then later read a philosophy article, than be bombarded with this silly sort of \"philosophical\" movie.",
