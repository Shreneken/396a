  "summary": "A series of intertwining love stories, stories of connections missed and made between people, how people always struggle to make a connection, and to what degree they succeed or don't.  (Good Machine Releasing)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Weaving many interconnected plot lines and more than a dozen lives together, this gifted writer-director has fashioned a bleak, brilliant comedy about loneliness, lovelessness, and alienation--a film that constantly upends our assumptions about what is heartbreaking, what is hilarious, and what is both.",
    "Unnerving because it forces us into uncharted waters: Solondz doesn't tell us how to feel but makes us thrash out our responses for ourselves. In doing so, he has made one of the few indelible movies of the year.",
    "Take the safety off of the comedy Magnum called Happiness and put the barrel in your mouth. You'll laugh your ass off as it takes off the back of your head...It could be the best film of the year. At the very least, I'll never forget it.",
    "Like David Lynch, Quentin Tarantino, and Paul Thomas Anderson, Solondz revels in ironic pop passion. It's a signature moment when he transforms Air Supply's \"All Out of Love\" into a geek-love rhapsody.",
    "It is not a film for most people. It is certainly for adults only. But it shows Todd Solondz as a filmmaker who deserves attention, who hears the unhappiness in the air and seeks its sources.",
    "A masterpiece.",
    "Thoroughly realized characters and relationships and Solondz's masterful ability to switch the tone from comic to tragic within the same scene help make Happiness a better film than it might have been otherwise. Much better, in fact.",
    "Part of this success is due to the exquisitely cast ensemble-composed of actors, not movie stars. To a man, woman and child, the unforced performers are spot-on.",
    "It has taken only two films, \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\" and now Happiness, for Todd Solondz to establish his as one of the most lacerating, funny and distinctive voices in American film.",
    "A brilliant, disturbing, but unstable and half-crazy piece of work.",
    "Corrosively funny yet emotionally devastating.",
    "One of the most challenging movies in years.",
    "Where Happiness shines, however, is in the series of extraordinary performances given by the members of the diverse ensemble cast. Leading the group is Dylan Baker, whose turn as Bill is astounding.",
    "If Hollywood were truly devoted to telling it like it is, Baker would win a special Oscar. To add to the creepiness, Solondz is (as he made clear in Dollhouse) an extremely sensitive director of kids.",
    "[Solondz's] blistering, brilliantly transgressive satire is sure to rattle even the most jaded filmgoer. It's also a remarkably compassionate profile of American life at its most desperate.",
    "An aching roundelay, a triumphantly benumbed ensemble farce that mingles condescension and compassion in a manner that's disarmingly--and often upsettingly--original.",
    "The aftertaste of that father-son scene is so strong, so disturbing, that the riches of Happiness -- its writing, its performances, its trenchant wit -- all seem a bit diminished in the bargain.",
    "The movie's intentions are as serious and thoughtful as its content is timely and sometimes horrifying. For adventurous viewers only.",
    "Baker does an amazingly sensitive job with the ticklish part and is joined in this by Read, who is superlative as his inquisitive young son.",
    "It lacks Altman's wisdom, but its sense of humor is corrosive, if dispiriting, and its willingness to show the human animal at his most disgusting has a kind of anti-grandeur to it.",
    "Solondz's greatest success is the pederast, heartbreakingly played by Baker...Had Solondz reached that apex in the other stories, it would have been a masterpiece.",
    "Everyone who likes this movie calls it \"disturbing,\" but what disturbs me most is the self-loathing laughter it provokes, similar to what one often hears at Woody Allen and Michael Moore comedies.",
    "It's not the subject matter itself that's offensive -- pedophilia is as worthy a topic of investigation as any other. Instead, it's the subject's non-treatment -- we don't learn a thing that rings true.",
    "There's nothing new about this sado-cinema, and nothing much worthy, either.",
    "Solondz's filmmaking style tries to make a virtue out of flatness and distance, and is always more comfortable indicating where feelings would go than actually providing them."

Three sisters; a young women socially isolated seekingEasily the most disturbing and hilarious film simultaneously ever made; the ultimate of dark humor movies. Happiness is an ensemble drama that skips around between multiple storylines. Three sisters; a young women socially isolated seeking relationships, another happily married with a psychiatrist husband and three kids. Unfortunately, her husband develops an unnatural fascination for his 11 year old son's male classmate, fantasizes about mass killing in a park, and masturbates to teen magazines. One of his patients, Allen (Seymour Hoffman) has a fascination for the third sister who desperately wants to be raped. Meanwhile, the apparently stable 40 year marriage of the sister's parents suddenly unravels when he decides he has had enough and wants to be alone. The lives of these people are all connected by the desire for happiness, often from immoral, dark sources. The only situation that seems out of place is the conversation in a diner where a lady admits to Allen about murdering someone. Clearly this is a film not for everyone due to the disturbing subject matters, it's the zenith of the darkest of dark humor. Fantastic all around performances by a formidable cast, especially Dylan Baker and Seymour Hoffman",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThis film is stunningly pessimistic, but in a lighthearted and weirdly optimistic way, lending a great insight into the complexities of the human condition. Great performances (especially from Dylan Baker) compliment this eccentric and brave script that fits together like a beautiful jigsaw and stares with a kind of accusatory tenderness into the soul of its audience. The third of three scenes in which Bill Maplewood (the paedophile) and his son discuss sex is so frank and tense, I had it in my head for weeks afterwards. I'd say the line 'Dad, would you ever  me?' is one of the most chilling in cinematic history. Apart from Jane Adams' character (Joy Jordan) being pretty annoying, this film is fairly flawless and should be seen by anyone reading this.",

The writing is all affect; the lines, gratuitously sardonic: self-involved people happlessly dumping on one another, poisoning everyone, everything in the film, poisoning the film itself. There is no glimpse of potential for any character - no soul; all misery. What amazes me is how much favor it has found with the critics. Are they so cynical, so starved for originalty (one credit to this film) that they are happy to bathe in its abject, unrelenting wretchedness? It must be a holiday of schadenfreude for the culturally overfed!",

A darkly humorous window into the lives of a bunch of people with a connected story all aimlessly searching for happiness in a cruel, hopeless world with a sick sense of humor. Every performance is incredibly strong, with both Jane Adams and Camryn Manheim feeling especially like real world people. The film's humor is at times blatant, and at other times incredibly clever and subtle, and the drama is balanced very well, and is always appropriately toned. Rarely does the movie's comedy spoil its more serious parts (except at the end, when the dog... you know). That confession scene between William Maplewood and his son, Billy, is especially well-executed. Despite how many characters were in the film, every single one felt essential to the movie's message. Each one of them was also fleshed out, and unique. No matter who you are, chances are you'll relate to at least one character in this film. Let us just hope that it isn't Mr. Maplewood.-Best Performance: Jane Adams (Although Camryn Manheim came close)",
