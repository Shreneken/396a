    "On a technical level, there's a lot to be said for Die Hard. It's when we get to some of the unnecessary adornments of the script that the movie shoots itself in the foot."

I would be partial to that sentiment to a certain degree. It isn't one of the best films ever made but it is top of its class in its respective genre, which is good enough for me. Bruce Willis is a terrific hero but It's Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman) who is the standout character of the flick. He's simply everything you ever look for in an evil villain - and the accent only helps. If you're looking for a fantastic popcorn feature to enjoy then look no further.",

Of course, trying to define Die Hard as nothing more than a hollow-day (!) movie would be doing it a great disservice. The characterisation of both McLane and Gruber (or Grinch - a coincidence? You decide) is done superbly by their respective actors. They draw you in with their personalities so well, that you find yourself cheering both of them on, just to see them continue to snap at each other. It's like a bizarro buddy-cop routine that took the 'good cop, bad cop' play a little too seriously. It's not incidental that the characters themselves often refer to cowboys and Westerns - this is a veritable wild-west duel, taken at a number of vertical paces rather than a standard back-to-back reflex test. That being said, however, some of the best moments are when McLane is just talking to himself, cracking wise while in the middle of a seemingly impossible situation. You don't have to convince anyone that you're a badass when you've just jumped off an exploding rooftop, Roy. You could try and make a case for the ending being cheesy and unnecessarily joyous, or that there are many implausible moments, but that would just be ill-spirited pedantry. This is action at its finest, and you better take what Mr. McTiernan gives you. There's no CGI or giant robots flying around - just good old-fashioned action, and it quickly becomes very obvious that films these days are just plain old doing it wrong. So sit back and plug in for two hours; you'll be yippie-kai-yaying in no time. Written for: www.webbinghaus.tumblr.com",

So often action movies are considered the filth of filmdom, containing silly plotting, thin character work, and juvenile thrills that appeal to the most basic, reptilian parts of our brains. But, I say again, let it be known that John McTiernan's \"Die Hard\" is not only the quintessential action movie, but an absolutely, undeniably well-made and brilliant film altogether. The plotting is exquisitely done, featuring numerous plot threads that are well-thought-out, revolutionary to the genre, and -- most of all -- smile inducing to the umpteenth degree. The characters within these plots are also unquestionably fascinating, with personalities that offer so much to the stakes and the situation at hand. And the action is thrilling, yes, but also terrifying. There's so much of this movie where you're simply convinced something has to go wrong for John McClane, but you also feel that you can't help but watch and see what happens. It's like watching a double-digit run rally in the bottom of the ninth to tie and eventually win the game -- you can't believe you're seeing it happen, but you feel blessed for being there to witness it. \"Die Hard\" is the pinnacle of action movie filmmaking and one of the best motion pictures that the medium has had to offer us.",

The book however is atThe other kind of Christmas movie, Bruce Willis / Alan Rickman signature role, a classic and the beginning of a long running franchise. Actually it is based on a book named “Nothing lasts Forever” by Roderick Thorp. The book however is at least unknown in my country and I was as much surprised about it being a book adaptation as everyone else I asked about. What I read about lead me to the conclusion that they improved the story as the book had a downer ending. The story follows detective John McClane who travels to Los Angeles on Christmas Eve in hope to reconcile with his wife Holly. She is on a party held by her employer the Nakatomi Corporation in their tower building on their Nakatomi Plaza. Unbeknownst to them a group of armed men led by Hans Gruber are targeting the vaults of the building. This is the set up for the story. The story itself is well written, intense, thrilling and enjoyable. I especially like that the villain Hans Gruber is not a moron. He is clever and adapts his plans perfectly to the situation. A very hard to overcome antagonist for John McClane. Also John McClane is not depicted as standard unharmable action hero and this makes the movie more special. He is neither perfect nor invulnerable or flawless and this was refreshing. I clearly see how this become a cult classic. The actors are the other thing that made the movie so good. Lets start with Bruce Willis as John McClane. It is his first mayor role in a big movie and became as much his signature role as much as breakthrough (as action star). He fully delivers his role and character. However Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber is even better. Only a few villains left such an impact. He is routinely high up on top movie villains list of all times. An absolute flawless performances or so close I can not see a difference. These two work well. The rest of the cast also delivers and I want to praise Reginald VelJohnson, Bonnie Belinda and Alexander Godunov for their roles. Visually the movie is awesome too. Be it the sets, stunts and action scenes. Everyting is fitting. Also there are many memorable scenes and everyone knows the phrase “Yippee Ki Yay”. The writing and dialogues are also well done for an action movie so I should praise of cause director John McTiernan and the two writers Jeb Staurd and Steven de Souza. The rest is history. It became a box office success, elevate both Willis and Rickman and became a cult classic atop on a different kind of Christmas movie. Overall this is a must see classic and I think this should be the final sentence in my review.",

In this film, he will try to save the life of a group of hostages held captive in a corporate skyscraper of Los Angeles. Directed by John McTiernan, the film has a script of Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza. Bruce Willis embodies the leading role. The film was nominated for four Oscars (Best Sound, Best Editing, Best Sound Effects, Best Visual Effects).At first glance, this film does not look like anything special. Another eighties action movie, full of explosions, police cars made in pieces and bloodthirsty killers facing a single man, full of noble intentions. However, this film has something different: in a decade full of bullet proof heroes, this hero does not act (or looks) as something indestructible. He hurts himself, complains all the time and looks like a guy facing a situation beyond his control. So, its not difficult for the public to chear McClane, making Willis great performance the big advantage of the film.Everything else followed, more or less, the pattern of the decade for action: stunning sets, special, visual and sound effects made with great care and regular performances from the rest of the cast (the interpretation of Alan Rickman, then still little known by non- British public, deserves a positive note of attention). This is an action film that captivates some audiences more adverse to this kind of movies, which proved to be the key to its success.",

The plot is delightfully simple; John McClane is a NewGerman terrorists, a skyscraper, Christmas Eve and LA. When these elements are combined, you get Die Hard, a 1988 rip-roaring action epic that shot Bruce Willis to international fame. The plot is delightfully simple; John McClane is a New York cop who is visiting his wife Holly in LA during Christmas Eve. He meets up with her at her business company's Christmas party. All goes well until a few uninvited guests in the form of creepy terrorists seize control of the building and take all 30 of the guests hostage, demanding a ransom. McClane, in the bathroom at their time of arrival, escapes into the unfinished skyscraper armed only with his standard issue 9mm at his disposal. His main objective; find out what the hell is going on. His only help is a flatfooted cop on the ground played by Reginald VelJohnson of Family Matters. Along the way, he is listening to radio messages between the villains with a stolen walkie talkie in an attempt to figure out their nefarious plan. Alan Rickman is great as Hans Gruber, leader of the baddies, and delivers a performance he echoes in the Harry Potter films as Prof. Severus Snape. One of the best movie villains of all time. This festival of explosions, guns and epic battles was directed by John McTiernan, famous already for the original Predator. He delivers a movie that entertains as well as it shocks. In particular, the sequence in which one of the hostages attempts to save his own life by offering McClane to the terrorists. Correctly anticipating a liar, Hans shoots him in the head. The film was one of the biggest box office hits of the 1980s and spawned three sequels throughout the 1990s and 2000s, firmly placing John McClane as an action hero alongside the Terminator and Rambo.

Bruce Willis is entertaining in the lead role, but beat-for-beat, I have seen this movie before many many times and that is excluding releases since 1988. The direction from John McTiernan is uninspired and he is practically invisible while his movie falls apart thanks to unrealistic sequences and being overlong. Honestly, this whole movie is pretty damn unrealistic. That being said, there are positives. Willis is charming, Alan Rickman is phenomenal, and the action is appropriately thrilling and largely well-directed. Those positives are enough for me to say Die Hard is middle of the road, but I do not really understand the acclaim.",

(And I don't even think it was opening weekend!) Take that into consideration for how big a movie this was back then and still is.\r Die Hard is the best action movie, and probably my favorite movie, with a close second or tie with The Shawshank Redemption.\r Die Hard combines well-executed action scenes with cheesy but iconic one-liners and a great main character. As sarcastic, profane, and messed up John McClane is, you have to find yourself rooting for him.\r Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, and Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, and many others will have their acting skills defined by this movie forever. After all, it definitely gave a career boost to some, although Willis already had a nice acting resume on his plate. Nevertheless, it redefined the whole genre.\r Action movies consist of a bunch of key elements that come together to form a coherent picture. (At least I hope it will be coherent, as some tend to fail at this process.) They combine action scenes (obviously), at least a couple one-liners, a car (there's always a car or some kind of vehicle), a villain, and usually an explosion or two. Or three.  All of these elements and many more were all in Die Hard, and it kind of changed the genre for good. You will hear people say \"Oh, that movie is a Die Hard rip-off\", or \"That stunt was first made famous in Die Hard.\" It's not that action movies didn't have these elements before Die Hard, it's just that Die Hard made them better and/or famous.\r Die Hard will keep you on the edge of your seat, and is an extremely well-done picture that doesn't lag or slow down at all.

This is the film that I've heard about years ago because the fourth film has come out in 2007. Many people consider this the memorable film of the decade and many people have watched this, my mum, dad and the teachers Pam, Simon and Helen. The film takes place in Nakatomi Plaza. Trust me, if I ever go there, I would go and have a look around and that John and the terrorists have been. I think it doesn't even capture the spirit of Christmas but for me, it just isn't Christmas until I've seen this film. I overall love this film and this is why I consider this one of my favourite films and I could never get tired of this. It's classy, it's action packed, it's quiet, it's loud, it's suspenseful, it's well paced, it's settle, it's explosive, it's everything you want in the movie. John McClane is played by Bruce Willis and what we have here is the terrorists. One is Hans Gruber played by everyone's favourite Alan Rickman, second is his savage henchman, third who looks like Huey Lewis, fourth is the nerdy scientist and the others are German. Gesundheit. John McClane goes to Nakatomi Plaza to meet his wife Holly McClane but all of the sudden, the terrorists are here to take over so John has to kill the terrorists before they kill all the hostages including Holly. The action scenes are really awesome and you will be thrilled by the suspense and it's like if you were in the roller coaster. Bruce Willis really does bring his character to the big screen. Alan Rickman is great as the villain Hans Gruber. Everybody remember him playing Professor Snape from the Harry Potter franchise and it's a shame that he died last year because he had pancreatic cancer. This movie is amazing, really is just stunning all the way through, very enjoyable and action packed thrilling experience. Years ago when I checked it out, I just realize that Bruce Willis says a memorable line in this memorable movie. He says \"Yippie-ki-yay, motherf%^ker!'' Any movie has a one-liner and the one-liners have always been the actual favourite for the die hard fans who says those memorable lines. John McTiernan has able to manipulate the story that the characters is going through. There are some flaws in this like the one with the hospital van. When the truck of terrorists have arrived, when they come out of the truck, the van is gone and when Theo is in the back of the truck, the van has appeared. I mean, how does that make any goddamn sense. Maybe it's just a movie mistake but who f£$%ing cares, I still enjoy it. The music is composed by Michael Kamen. It's good to hear his music in Lethal Weapon before this. And I gotta say, listening to his music in Die Hard and Lethal Weapon is the most similar thing than watching these two movies together and the sequels. When I ever heard his music, I gotta say, Michael Kamen is one of my favourite music composers along with Hans Zimmer, John Williams and David Foster. I love this movie with the vengeance, it has some explosives, awesome action scenes, great suspense and iconic pacing. Every person know that Die Hard is the most awesome 80's action film made for the Die Hard fans and myself. I love every single second of this and this is why I enjoyed it and I'm the only one who is obsessed with this for many generations. For many people who haven't seen this, I genuinely recommend that you watch it. For many fans out there who love this, Congratulations. If you don't like it then I suggest that you go to hell. For many people who says those lines from the movies that had one-liners, they're always be the ones with the highlight from the characters. People who quote the lines like myself quoting these lines forever and ever like in animation from Disney, Dreamworks and videogames with my friends. This movie is a must-see for many who haven't seen it. I've seen a million times and I will definitely watch it a million times again. Die Hard is one of my favourite films of all time.",

Alguns momentos doMeu maior problema ao fazer uma review desse titulo é cometer diversos anacronismos, pois muita coisa que vemos aqui era nova na época de origem.O tanto de obras que este longa inspirou e que já assisti não são poucas. Alguns momentos do filme foram bem previsíveis, e talvez isso não seja necessariamente um demérito pelos motivos citados acima, mas mesmo assim posso dizer que gostei do roteiro como um todo. Os personagens são ótimos, assim como a performance do elenco. Bruce Willis tá muito bem no papel, e entrega toda a carisma necessária para lidar com seu personagem, assim como sua insegurança em alguns momentos. Mas a real estrela aqui, na minha opinião, é Alan Rickman - e que performance meus amigos... A apresentação dele é muito bem feita pelo diretor, já sabemos quem é o \"vilão\" cabeça apenas pelo jogo de câmera. Seus diálogos são bem interessantes e algumas cenas em especifico, como a do sotaque, ficam marcadas na memoria de tão boas. O plano é muito bem desenvolvido, se mostrando muito mais inteligente no ultimo arco, e de fato seria perfeito se não fosse o McClane.As cenas de ação são boas, nada impressionante, mas funcionam. A dinâmica entre os acontecimentos dentro do prédio e a policia - atrapalhando - funcionou bem. Ainda assim, aconteceram uma escorregadas feias no roteiro. Alguns acontecimentos são forçados demais, como a mulher IGNORANDO o pedido de ajuda do protagonista. Ou então a demora do mesmo para chamar atenção do policial que estava fora do prédio. Quer dizer, era só disparar contra o policial e pronto, os reforços chegariam rapidinho. Mas fora isso, o roteiro funciona bem na maior parte do tempo.Quality: 1080p SDR on Q60T 50' [Bluray - High Bitrate]Audio: English, with Portuguese subtitles. TV Speakers.",

Made in 1988 and starring Bruce Willis as New York cop, John McClane who travels to Nakatomi plaza at Christmas to see his wife (Bonnie Bedelia). About an hour later we see John McClane on the phone and the sudden sound of gunshots firing. A team of terrorists seize control of the Nakatomi high rise building and control all the cameras, elevators, power, etc. One thing they can't do is get into a vault that's carrying bearer bonds which the terrorists are interested in but never give up trying. They kill the owner of the building who's incharge after asking for the code for the vault to unlock it. Meanwhile John McClane (Bruce Willis) has escaped BV undetected and hiding somewhere in the high rise building. The terrorists have taken everyone else in the building hostage, later the police and FBI get called in because of the terrorists threat. However they can't enter the high rise building because that puts the hostages in danger as the terrorists will kill them off so the police listen to the terrorists demands. Meanwhile still inside the building cop John McClane (Willis) starts killing off the terrorists one by one sand saves the day. By the end of the movie many police will be injured or dead, hostages killed and a building destroyed with dead terrorists. However many hostages were also saved and Die Hard is one of the greatest action films ever made with excellent action scenes executed to perfection.. Rated 18 for violence, bad language and nudity... Excellent film!",

I'm kind of a movie buff, and I'm interested in all genres. The people who bash this movie seem to be pretentious jackasses. Die Hard is what it is: an action movie. If features ridiculously large explosions, brawls that would leave any real human being dead or permanently crippled, and unbelievable stunts. Everything that's expected from an action movie, but it also has a bit of heart. You care about the characters and the villains are trite but still believable and not completely one-dimensional. Excellent acting. It also gives us one of the best movie lines ever: \" Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.",

Bruce Willis shines in the one film in the series that allows his vulnerability to show, and the supporting cast around him are excellent as well. Alan Rickman debuts with a bang as Hans Gruber, delivering his lines with a cold condescension that you can't help but hate. The plot is air-tight, with not a single line of dialogue or camera movement being unnecessary. Also the human elements in this film, adding to our connection to the character. Regardless of your thoughts on its holiday connection, it's a damn good movie",

The story begins when New York police detective John McClane arrives to Los Angeles,wherr his family lives, and goes to a party with his wife. The party is made to celebrate some bog achievement of  the big company (and christmas ) where his wife works, and is situated in huge skyscraper, in the heart of los angeles. As it happens on christmas night, the building is left all empty and unprotected. Suddenly, the lights go off and a group of terrotists masterfuly capture the building and announce that everyone in the building is  now a hostage. But the main character John McClane wasnt present at the party during the hostage capture. Realizing, that he cant rely on help from outside, he starts to fight all by his own.The movie creates a very thrilling and tensed atmosphere, and its gripping plot in addition to fantastic casting makes it an actual golden hit. Appearances of terrorists, as wel as the appearance of the main character match actors amazingly.I thoroughly  recommend this movie — in my opinion, its a must - seen for everyone, not depending on age. You will surely love it, no doubts.",
