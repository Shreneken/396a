  "critic_reviews": [
    "A Woman Under the Influence gives us a woman whose influences only gradually reveal themselves. And as they do, they give us insights not only into one specific, brilliantly created, woman but into some of the problems of surviving in a society where very few people are fully liberated.",
    "An astonishing, compulsive film, directed with a crackling energy.",
    "Rowlands gives a harrowing performance as a housewife coming unhinged.",
    "Cassavetes makes the viewer's frustration work as part of the film's expressiveness; it has an emotional rhythm unlike anything else I've ever seen.",
    "That sort of depth is rare in most movies; it's the trademark, however, of John Cassavetes.",
    "One of the rawest, toughest, most emotionally scalding portraits of a marriage ever put on screen.",
    "Falk and Rowlands—in performances of almost indescribable intensity—detail a marriage anchored by love, but tossed by the expectations of others and the unpredictable swell of madness.",
    "Falk and the rest of the cast are exceptional—even the smallest roles feel spot-on—but Rowlands (who will be on hand for the opening-night screening) is the film.",
    "An exceptional film anchored by love and set alight with the unpredictability of mental health, this is a must for Cassavetes fans and newcomers alike.",
    "Tough-minded, moving study of a working-class housewife's mental breakdown, enhanced by superb performances from Rowlands, in the title role, and Falk as her husband.",
    "This is a disturbing portrait of a slightly-mad housewife. Its serious treament of a downbeat subject is hypoed by a fine performance from Peter Falk and a bravura one from Gena Rowlands.",
    "As with most Cassavetes' it is Rowlands who steals this show, this time expertly playing the happy housewife slowly going off the rails while Falk plays the part of her bewildered husband. At two-and-a-half hours, it could easily have dragged but with such strong performances, you're left wanting more.",
    "The movie didn't need to be 2 hours and 35 minutes long: there's too much small talk, which doesn't really reveal character. Still, the most frightening scenes are extremely compelling, and this is a thoughtful film that does prompt serious discussion.",
    "A Woman Under the Influence made me wonder: What’s the point of only showing a mentally challenged character’s distress? Is it fair to reduce Mabel to her rock-bottom experiences?"

It reminds me of Rosemary's Baby, which starred the director Nick Cassavetes as the husband. He is also  considered the father of independent cinema, primarily for this, though by thisn point he had been directing for 15 years.  Gena Rowlands and Peter Falk take turns being the crazy person in this fantastic film.  Her time in the asylum is never shown, but was a point of fascination for filmmakers at this time, most notably a year later when Jack Nicholson was electrocuted in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  Of note, in modern times Electroshock therapy has found new support through celebrities like Carrie Fisher, who famously said electroshock \"has an appetite for your memories.\"",
