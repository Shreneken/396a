  "critic_reviews": [
    "Who would have thought that Super Mario Bros., the movie based on the popular video game, could be such a treat? There are some, I'm sure, who saw the end of civilization here. But relax. This movie, which was directed by music video whiz kids Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel, is sweet and funny and full of bright invention. In short, it's a blast.",
    "Unfortunately, the highlights are sporadic. British co-directors Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel created the similarly ambitious \"Max Headroom\" TV series, but they lack the visionary gifts of Terry Gilliam, and so Super Mario Bros. remains more of a game than the awesome movie it's trying to be. Can anyone say that's surprising?",
    "This bizarre, special effects-filled movie doesn't have the jaunty hop-and-zap spirit of the Nintendo video game from which it takes -- ahem -- its inspiration. What it has instead are a weird, jokey science-fiction story, \"Batman\"-caliber violence and enough computer-generated dinosaurs to get the jump on \"Jurassic Park.\"",
    "The first film to be adapted from rather than into a Nintendo cartridge, Super Mario Bros, is a shrill, hectic and tiresome fantasy with little story, less excitement and no imaginable audience.",
    "Kids will probably love this film but, to be frank, most children aren't that discriminating (apologies to the few who are). There's nothing in the film that's reprehensible (although some may find the concept of a one-hundred five minute commercial for a game offensive in itself), but I find it hard to believe that many adults accompanying their youngsters will be entertained. In general, about the best recommendation I can come up with regarding this movie is to turn on the Nintendo and play a game yourself. You'll have more fun, spend less money, and it will be over a whole lot faster.",
    "The movie knocks your eyes out, at the same time it dulls the mind’s eye. Ultimately, it’s one more stop in the arcade, beckoning, waiting to soak up time and money.",
    "Loud, frenetic and facile, Super Mario Bros. is full of noisy sound and cartoon fury, signifying… a sequel.",
    "Despite eye-catching sets and smart casting, this first feature-length film to be adapted from a video game is a bloated muddle.",
    "Yes, designer David L Snyder has done wonders with the set; yes, there's decent photography and effects; yes, the giant Goombas are splendid. But the whole is not a dinosaur, it's a dog. It will baffle kids, bore adolescents, and depress adults.",
    "Stands out as a prime example of what not to do when trying to construct a watertight feature-length narrative on the foundations of a simplistic platform game.",
    "There are plenty of gags, but not one laugh in the whole farrago...There’s nothing original about “Mario,” and the absence of tension or an interesting narrative makes it tedious in the extreme.",
    "Super Mario Bros. devotes half its run time to lumbering exposition, yet still makes no f.cking sense. Seldom has a film done such heavy lifting to such meager effect."

      "content": "The Super Mario Brothers games are still great fun. Admittedly they are light on plot, almost simplistic, but they are imaginative, lots of fun and thrilling with memorable characters and interaction.'Super Mario Bros' did have a good dealThe Super Mario Brothers games are still great fun. Admittedly they are light on plot, almost simplistic, but they are imaginative, lots of fun and thrilling with memorable characters and interaction.'Super Mario Bros' did have a good deal of potential, with talented actors like Bob Hoskins, Fiona Shaw, Samantha Mathis and Dennis Hopper on board, and it was always going to be interesting to see whether the film would be able to make an interesting story that didn't have a huge amount of narrative material to work from. Unfortunately, it is a real let down, and was doomed from the start from trying to do too much and from its notoriously troubled behind-the-scenes.Video game/interactive film adaptations have a very dubious record, always giving a sense that video/interactive games don't translate well to film, and 'Super Mario Bros' is not an exception. This said, in general there are far worse films out there, while it misses more than it hits 'Super Mario Bros' has a few good spots. Some of the photography is good. Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo do their best in the lead roles and both do a more than respectable job especially Hoskins. Their chemistry and rapport is enjoyable if at times rather too father and son than brothers. Alan Silvestri's score while in want of more recognisable themes for fans is well-suited for the film and has a nice rousing energy, atmosphere and whimsy. Good song choices too.However, 'Super Mario Bros' has several problems that stop it from being the thrill ride it could have been. The rest of the cast don't really impress that much. Dennis Hopper is always a great pleasure in over-the-top roles, particularly villain ones and when he loses it, and on paper he did seem an ideal choice. The thing is though with a role like Frank Booth in 'Blue Velvet', Hopper was not only over-the-top but also terrifying and the character was interesting, here in 'Super Mario Bros' as King Koopa Hopper is a large piece of unsubtle ham and that's it and there are some points where he's almost subdued, sometimes you expect Hopper to lose his rag and it doesn't really happen. His dialogue also further dumbs down the character, making King Koopa very much a missed opportunity as a villain. Samantha Mathis has some moments of heart and charm but is pretty bland on the whole, while Fiona Shaw at times comes close to out-hamming Hopper. The Goombas are sometimes sort of fun, but sometimes pointless and too goofy.It is a shame really that the film's production troubles come through loud and clear in the film itself. The direction has a very inexperienced and erratic feel, and like the directors had no idea what to do with the film. The same is with the story, granted credit is due for trying to do something with source material that doesn't give them an awful lot to work with and it's very energetic in pace and never dull. Unfortunately, there is the sense that the writers didn't know which direction to go or how to start, with target demographic/audience and what it wanted to be never really clear (despite also being a bad film with many huge problems, 'Street Fighter' at least got that right). 'Super Mario Bros' constantly feels rushed, bloated, over-complicated and like there was too much going on, and further sadly not all of it was necessary or made sense as a result of not being explored enough. Exposition is also garbled, so that it has nothing to do with the games other than a few clumsily inserted references which reeked of trying to squeeze them in when this fact was realised in production.As well as lacking in thrills, as a result of the over-crowded and over-complicated story, there is a lack of fun and imagination. The jokes are too juvenile and too embarrassingly awkward to be any fun, and only succeeds in dumbing down so many of the characters (a huge part as to why King Koopa is lacking as a villain). In fact, the script generally was poor, with childish and sometimes misplaced humour and dialogue that clunks badly. Action is very jagged and stop-start. Apart from in the photography and in a couple of neat effects, the expensive for back then budget is not hugely obvious in the production values, where interference and production troubles are second most obvious after the story. The sets are cluttered, too small in scale and quite drab and lacking in colour or dazzle, the world is never fully immersed and others have said it looks like a cheaper and dumbed down 'Blade Runner' which this reviewer agrees with. A lot of the effects are slapdash even for the early pre-'Jurassic Park' 90s.Overall, has some good assets but, while it is not as horrendous as the universal critical and commercial failure on release and as its reputation suggests, too much of it is lacking for it to be the thrill-ride it had the potential of being with the right execution. 4/10 Bethany Cox",

The thing about me is that I knew nothing about Mario, and I had never played the games at the time. I actually got a game boy a few years later. Anyway, considering all that, I actually liked this movie a lot at the time. I thought it was a great Sci-Fi Dino-Punk adventure. I enjoyed the concept of this alternate dino-universe, and I enjoyed the characters. I also loved the crazy design of the city of Dino-Hattan, and the ambiance was like nothing I had every seen in any other movie (well, at 7 years old, I didn't know about Blade Runner).Nowadays, I have played all of the main Mario games, but I still have a lot of nostalgia for this film. But I can see more faults now. In retrospect, sure, it's not faithful to the lore because it went in a weird direction. Some of the major plot points are not very solid. And considering how the movie was made, it's actually amazing how watcheable and decent the final product is. Perhaps its weakest trait is that it's linked to the Mario franchise. On its own, without the Mario name, this movie might have fared better based on its Dino-Punk novelty alone. But of course, Jurassic Park would have destroyed it a year later.",

The special effects wereHonestly, the plot in this \"Super Mario Bros.\" movie is too much like the movie \"Speed.\" The plot devices in this movie worked with \"Speed\", a highly successful movie, but not with this particular mess of a movie.  The special effects were also really cheesy, and did make the audience feel like it was in an actual moment in the \"Super Mario Bros.\" games.  I grew up with \"Super Mario Bros.\" and this movie is not faithful at all to the game material.  The acting did not help either. The acting was pretty run-of-the-mill for a movie. The acting is nothing like the acting in a video game. The acting is more like acting found in an action thriller, like \"Speed.\" \"Super Mario Bros\" is not supposed to be an action flick. It is supposed to be a movie that closely resembles that of the video game. Even the poster looks so cut-rate and disappointing. Mario and Luigi look nothing as they do in the games, or even as they are in the \"Super Mario Brothers Super Show\" I grew up with as a kid. Besides, this movie lacks humor the audience would find funny. Most of the humor consists of overly-used slapstick gags, that turn out to be more annoying than funny. The only remotely (no pun intended) attractive part of this movie is Dennis Hopper. Dennis Hopper really is the only reason to come down and watch this weird, slapsticky, action-filled movie that is supposed to take place in a game, but really is nothing but some weird action flick, using similar plot devices to the successful (and completely different) movie \"Speed.\"",
