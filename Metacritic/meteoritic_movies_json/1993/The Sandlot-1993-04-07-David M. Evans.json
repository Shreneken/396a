  "summary": "In the summer of 1962, a new kid in town is taken under the wing of a young baseball prodigy and his rowdy team, resulting in many adventures.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The Sandlot lays down life’s little lessons with the feathery touch of a sacrifice bunt. During the ball-retreiving scenes, as the gang learns to work as a team off the field, the movie never loses its quick pace or its sense of fun. Old baseball wisdom: The best teams win with strong fundamentals. So do the best movies.",
    "This is a movie for anyone who has ever loved baseball and for anyone who enjoys the American Graffiti/Stand by Me style of narrative. Highly recommended.",
    "These days too many children's movies are infected by the virus of Winning, as if kids are nothing more than underage pro athletes, and the values of Vince Lombardi prevail: It's not how you play the game, but whether you win or lose. This is a movie that breaks with that tradition, that allows its kids to be kids, that shows them in the insular world of imagination and dreaming that children create entirely apart from adult domains and values.",
    "A scruffy underdog yarn that will appeal not only to kids but also to their thirty- or fortysomething parents.",
    "This rosy film is clearly not for the Peter Pan set: Even today’s younger viewers who aren’t eggheads may never have heard of a sandlot-much less the Sultan of Swat. The only thing they’ll revel in is replaying the slobbery-canine-confronting climax again and again.",
    "Allen (Raiders of the Lost Ark) is ideally cast as the mom, and as the step-dad, Leary gets a break from his bad boy of MTV image. The Sandlot is truly one about the boys of summer.",
    "There are those who will see this as a silly fantasy, but they have either missed or chosen not to feel the magic woven by The Sandlot. Predictable as the movie is, the Field of Dreams quality is not the only thing to like about The Sandlot.",
    "Kids will understand this stuff. If you can remember your younger, goofier roots, so will you. Sandlot isn't well made but it's alive with dopey, summertime spirit.",
    "This “Field of Dreams” field has been plowed so many times that the land is no longer arable. Isn’t it time to cultivate a few new cliches?",
    "Nothing about his modest coming-of-age comedy demands anything like this awestruck approach.",
    "The comedy is broad, cartoonish, and quite funny in a faux \"Little Rascals\" manner. The movie is almost completely derivative, but that's part of the fun.",
    "In The Sandlot's nostalgia for simpler times, a single-sex world seems to be a key component.",
    "This is definitely a post-\"Field of Dreams\" movie, at home in an era that specializes in building ersatz old parks, like the honey at Camden Yards. I love that place, even if it's more theme park than ball yard (I also love theme parks). But \"The Sandlot\" isn't a theme park or a ball yard; it's a con job.",
    "It's hard to believe that a bunch of scrappy kids would really be scared of a big dog, which leaves the premise of this film floundering. However the kids prove to be plucky enough to give the film some kind of motivation but the direction lacks in humour or excitement.",
    "Sweet and sincere, the film is also a remarkably shallow wade, rife with incident and slim on substance.",
    "Chock-a-block with cute reminiscence - which is a shame, because if it weren't so knowing, this would be quite a likeable little comedy about nothing in particular.",
    "Has enough dog slobber, curdled hurl and toe-jam jokes to keep its target audience amused. Older kids and overgrown ones too probably will notice that nothing much ever happens in this belabored suburban variation on \"The Little Rascals.\"",
    "After a \"Porky's\"-style segment dealing with puppy lust, the film then segues to its better second half, hitting its stride when a ball signed by the revered Babe Ruth must somehow be retrieved from behind the fence."
