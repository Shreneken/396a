  "critic_reviews": [
    "For in relating the true story of Conlon's wrongful conviction and 15-year imprisonment, Sheridan has used the tools of the filmmaker to evoke a visceral echo of Conlon's waking nightmare.",
    "Jim Sheridan skillfully interweaves a myriad of subplots and themes into a fast-paced, cohesive whole.",
    "But the filmmakers have invigorated and enriched the story through the use of a thousand details, a strong sense of time and place, outstanding characterizations and a display of energy and cinematic flair that marks an advance on \"My Left Foot.\"",
    "Sheridan, however, works with such piercing fervor and intelligence that In the Name of the Father just about transcends its tidy moral design.",
    "And, riskiest of all, the film makers eschewed another grainy documentary go at the subject in favor of a movie drama of one of the most compelling true stories of the modern troubles.",
    "In the Name of the Father is as good a compromise of fact and fiction as you could hope for -- and still call it a movie.",
    "The picture turns into a kind of stylized morality play about the right and the wrong ways for Irishmen to respond to distorted portraits of their character, and it's terrifically effective.",
    "Though the facts have been manipulated in the interests of drama--Gerry and Giuseppe were never imprisoned together, etc.--this has been done in a brave and responsible way, shedding light on an important episode in recent history.",
    "But the acting's so good it frequently transcends the simplicities of the script, and whenever Day-Lewis or Postlethwaite is on-screen the movie crackles.",
    "By the end of the movie, whether or not you're a member of Sinn Fein, the Brits' brutality toward the Conlons will get your Irish up.",
    "The movie does a harrowing job of showing how, and why, a man might be made to confess to a bombing he didn't commit.",
    "He gets much of what he wants, but not all of it, and not all of the time - the film is just too eclectic on occasion, a bit jumpy in its tone and its pacing.",
    "Based on Gerry Conlon's own account of his arrest and subsequent incarceration, the film takes forever to do what \"60 Minutes\" does with the same meat in a single segment."

It suffers from some of the problems that many historical pictures tend to; namely a lack of focus and coherence in service of plot elements that leads to not always understanding the significance of certain scenes and character actions (especially the years in prison with Gerry teaming up with and then turning on an actual IRA terrorist).

However, I can't recall that I have seen a troubled father-son relationship (brought to life by astonishing performances from Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite) has been better depicted than in this. Just look at how the experience of imprisonment somehow matured Gerry up, whether by getting to know his father more and better (the dialogue between Gerry and Giuseppe is just phenomenal), or merely due to the incidents and mishaps that he had in prison. Not to mention the painful and provocative meticulous dramatization of a miscarriage of injustice, vividly portrayed by some of the most sensible, artistic, emotionally-charged scenery that Jim Sheridan's nuanced direction are responsible of. Happy Birthday to the greatest actor ever, Daniel Day-Lewis. I do miss him!(8/10)",
