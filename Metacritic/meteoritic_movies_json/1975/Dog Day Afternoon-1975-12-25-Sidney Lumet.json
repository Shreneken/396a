  "critic_reviews": [
    "Pacino simmers in this daring and brilliantly constructed treatise on the many facets of a crime.",
    "Dog Day Afternoon is a frank social melodrama that’s also a celebration of quotidian bravery. The camera might linger on guns and barely restrained violence, but it also dwells upon the love and the support that’s extended in the weirdest and most unexpected of places.",
    "A masterly reconstruction of a Brooklyn bank siege on August 22, 1972, built around arguably Al Pacino's finest screen performance.",
    "The entire cast is excellent, top to bottom. Dog Day Afternoon is, in the whole as well as the parts, film-making at its best.",
    "The film's tone is extraordinarily flexible, holding within the same reality elements of the absurd, the ridiculous and the comic while sustaining a sense of tension and dread throughout. This is, of course, one of the classic Pacino roles - he's so appealing - but don't overlook the late John Cazale as his accomplice, who gives us a character who's stupid and scared, troubled and dangerous, and disturbingly inscrutable.",
    "Dog Day Afternoon benefits immeasurably from a cast and crew doing some of the finest work of their careers. One of the finest films of the 1970s.",
    "Dog Day Afternoon is a melodrama, based on fact, about a disastrously illplanned Brooklyn bank robbery, and it's beautifully acted by performers who appear to have grown up on the city's sidewalks in the heat and hopelessness of an endless midsummer.",
    "For all of its social, political and cinematic significance, Dog Day Afternoon is a terrifically entertaining and emotionally devastating film to boot.",
    "Lumet is exploring the clichés, not just using them. And he has a good feel for the big-city crowd that's quickly drawn to the action.",
    "The film's strength lies in its depiction of surfaces, lacking the visual or intellectual imagination to go beyond its shrewd social and psychological observations and its moments of absurdist humour.",
    "One of Sidney Lumet's best jobs of directing and one of Al Pacino's best performances (as a bisexual bank robber) come together in a populist thriller with lots of New York juice. Its details are stronger than its structure—the film loses some of its energy before the end—but it's an astonishing fusion of suspense and character, powered by superior ensemble acting.",
    "Al Pacino gives an electric performance, charged with a lunatic energy that expertly captures the weird blend of confidence and self-deprecation (if not hatred) that marks the paranoid syndrome.",
    "Enjoyable and even exciting at the start, Dog Day Afternoon degenerates into frustration and tedium toward nightfall—an experience no less painful for the audience than for the actors."

Dans ces conditions exécrables, tous les efforts d’Al Pacino sont réduits à néant, de quoi être furax.",

Sidney Lumet still needs to be a bit strict on editing part but other than that he has done a great job from his side. Al Pacino is as usual, brilliant on portraying this broken real persona and brings out the best of him without any support (he literally is a one man show in this one). Dog Day Afternoon hits hard and fast with amusing perspective that stays true till the last frame along with an intense showdown between the cat and mouse sequences in its last act that always will be the highlight of this feature.",

IThis is a very tense film, with good dialogue. Your constantly unsure of how things will develop, plot wise and obviously what the ultimate outcome will be for the hostages, as well as the two rather quirky main characters, Sonny and Sal. I found myself feeling empathy towards both the hostages and the hostage takers, which isn't always the case in such films. I found it particularly engrossing due to having read that its based on a true story - the film being based on a magazine article. I found it interesting the relationship between the police and Sonny, as the situation developed. I found myself questioning the actions of the police at times, in as much as there are numerous scenes with Sonny just outside the bank entrance, in clear view of the police and snipers, whereby I'd have thought it would have been pretty quick and easy to shoot him down and knowing its an American film, I was surprised that the authorities weren't more gun-ho. This is very much a character driven film and I felt there was a good amount of character development, with some witty dialogue thrown in. I thought this film was quite engrossing - its very tense at times and was certainly an easy and entertaining watch. I liked that the female hostages came across as generally quite sharp-tongued and certainly not very ditzy, which is good to see, given the fact its a 70s film. If anything, the main characters of Sonny and Sal come across as having more vulnerabilities than the bank staff, who keep their fear(s) to themselves.This is a tense and engrossing film and the fact its, if in part, based on a true story, made it more intriguing a watch for me. I felt the performances were especially good and I liked the character development and plot pace, although if im to be overly critical then I suppose I may question the response (or lack of at times) of the authorities. I'm happy to recommend this film as a good example of a crime drama/bank heist based film, with good performances.",

This study is highlighted all the more by one of Al Pacino's best performances alongside that of the under-appreciated Joe Casale.  Given the year of 1975 that this film was made, as well as being based off of a true news article in 1972, the film can be interpreted as a post-Vietnam whiplash effect on the American public (particularly the youth).",

When I'm being f**ked, I like to get kissed a lot.”Dog Day Afternoon is a fantastic 'bank robbery gone wrong' movie, but becomes so much more than that.I’ve been planning on watching this movie for awhile, but failed each time. Now it makes me appreciate my patience after finally checking it out at LIFF (Leeds International Film Festival). Seeing this on a big screen rather than a small one made the experience even more special.The run time of two hours and 30 minutes, which is crazy because none of it dragged. I loved every minute of it. I was surprised how comedic it is, as I originally expected it to be a crime drama. It's hilarious seeing the hostages who were scared at first, but eventually got so comfortable around the robbers, they toy with their semi-auto rimfire rifles. Even ordering pizza and sodas, and Sonny (Pacino) pays for it with bank money.Al Pacino is one of the all time greats. His voice, facial tics, walk, hunch, accent, etc. There’s so much to pick up on his performance. He’s better than sex. John Cazale is a national treasure and left us way too soon. The chemistry between Sonny and Sal is dynamic. Sidney Lumet directing captives the entire event and makes it absolutely gripping, especially the climax which had me on edge.Pacino is fire. Cazale is holy. Sidney is god.",

So, when I found out about this film, where it plays the lead role and it's still a robbery, I said to myself, why the hell. Al Pacino is simply the best movie gangster / mobster / robber. He just plays crime to number one. That's my opinion of the actors. Back to the movie. He won't let you wait long and we will find ourselves at the scene in the first minutes and the robbery begins. Fast pace. No planning. From the beginning, something happens all the time. After a while, however, the film will slow down, so if you are not interested in this topic or this event, which was filmed in truth, then it will probably not be very lively for you to watch. But for me a great film that I recommend.",
