    "summary": "A veteran D.C. journalist (Anne Hathaway) loses the thread of her own narrative when a guilt-propelled errand for her father (Willem Dafoe) thrusts her from byline to unwitting subject in the very story she\u2019s trying to break.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "The film that follows is, admittedly, a bit of a mess. It\u2019s also compelling, energetic, and well-acted, finding one of our most intriguing filmmakers all but flinging herself outside of her comfort zone.",
        "There\u2019s some overreach and muddle here \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t want a pop quiz on the plot \u2014 but \u201cLast Thing\u201d remains an intriguing, visually diverting piece, well shot by Bobby Bukowski.",
        "Like The Snowman, The Last Thing He Wanted fails to give its audience all the clues necessary to form a coherent picture, and flops in spite of what should be a killer director/cast combination.",
        "The Last Thing He Wanted is trying to be too many things at once. It goes off on several tangents that don\u2019t ever conclude.",
        "This all contributes to the impression that the director\u2019s interest in the project came down to just about everything except the plot. Which is understandable given the source material, but doesn\u2019t excuse the fact that The Last Thing He Wanted sputters on most of the basic terms it sets for itself. Still, there is at least some nobility to its failure.",
        "Nothing connects, nothing gels, and every thread is lost.",
        "The Last Thing He Wanted makes some kind of sense at the end. But getting through its long, unwieldy middle is an undertaking \u2014 and not even a serious-minded political thriller like this one should feel so much like an assignment.",
        "The big problem with the movie isn\u2019t the muddle, but the strain.",
        "The human dimension that gives the film brief jolts of energy never takes root. Instead, audiences are left grappling with a stuffy maze, albeit one presented with handsome production values and a filmmaker\u2019s striking visual touch.",
        "The Last Thing He Wanted is a thing that no one wanted.",
        "The emotional and logistical struggles of our heroine, played with sweaty determination by Anne Hathaway, are the film's clearest through-line; but after the intimate clarity of her debut, Pariah, and the wrenching Delta drama Mudbound, this is a pedigreed misfire.",
        "It stops making sense about thirty minutes in and never recovers.",
        "Dee Rees\u2019 The Last Thing He Wanted is incomprehensible to an almost impressive degree \u2014 usually when a movie's narrative gets so out of control, it over-corrects itself at some point before the end. But not here.",
        "The first half doesn\u2019t fit with the second half, there are too many distractions and the filmmakers think it\u2019s clever to leave clues but they do it clumsily and at the last minute and it\u2019s really exhausting for the viewer.",
        "The tell-all expos\u00e9 on why exactly The Last Thing He Wanted is a failure on almost every level is likely many years away, but it\u2019s been some time since such a promising concoction of talented ingredients has resulted in something so impossibly dull, gratingly lethargic, and utterly incoherent.",
        "On film, The Last Thing He Wanted settles for just being hollow. It\u2019s the last thing any of us wanted."

It was the last thing I wanted to see. There is so much that is wrong with this film. Whenever I watch a movie for the first time, I pay full attention to it so that I don\u2019t miss any details. After watching this, I thought, \u201cWhat?\u201d. I don\u2019t understand what this movie was about or what happened. Its plot is so convoluted and confusing that I honestly can\u2019t tell you what happened. The film has little to no structure to it. Scenes just happen and then they go on to another unrelated scene. Since I couldn\u2019t understand what was happening, I was incredibly bored. This is one of the most boring films I have ever seen. None of the characters are interesting or developed in the slightest. I like Ben Affleck, Anne Hathaway, and Willem Dafoe but I hated their characters. They are all unlikeable and don\u2019t have any motivation for what they do. Anne Hathway\u2019s character doesn\u2019t like her father at all and yet she decides to take over his job? It made no sense. Their performances weren\u2019t that great either. Willem Dafoe was fine and his performance was the only aspect I found above average but Affleck and Hathaway were pretty bad. Hathaway sounded like a robot the entire film and Affleck who has top billing was only in the film for 15 minutes. He contributed almost nothing to the film. The other actors did a pretty poor job and were very forgettable. I honestly forgot that Toby Jones was in the film until I started writing this. The script they were given was particularly awful. The dialogue was poorly written and shallow which hampered everyone\u2019s performance. The cinematography was fine. It wasn\u2019t special but it wasn\u2019t bad. The editing was particularly annoying though. It would cut randomly during scenes which threw off the focus of it. At other points, the editing would cut so rapidly and quickly that it was hard to tell what was going on. Overall, The Last Thing He Wanted is a convoluted, confusing, and boring film with a poor script, bad characters, and obnoxious editing.",

It's as if each one of the writers wrote a 5 minute segment and then the finished transcript was a random collection of those each segments. Making no sense or rhyme what so ever.",

It fails in just about every regard except that it is shot well and the actors do a good job with the (horrible) material they're given. The cinematography is often great, surprising, given how incompetently the script is. The first half remains the pretense of being a movie that is just boring; however, after the first hour it devolves into increasingly unbelievable nonsense.
