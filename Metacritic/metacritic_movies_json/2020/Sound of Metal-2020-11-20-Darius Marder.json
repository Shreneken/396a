When a specialist tells him his condition will rapidly worsen, he thinks his music career \u2014 and with it his life \u2014 is over. His bandmate and girlfriend Lou (Olivia Cooke) checks the recovering heroin addict into a secluded sober house for the deaf in hopes it will prevent a relapse and help him learn to adapt to his new situation.

        "A small film that hits big, Sound Of Metal is a gem you\u2019ll want to bang the drum for.",
        "Nothing about the sound in Sound of Metal is ordinary.",
        "On the surface it\u2019s a solid and and absorbing character study.  But thanks to Marder\u2019s script and masterful direction, and Ahmed\u2019s beautiful performance, there are increasingly deeper layers that take this movie to a deeper place.",
        "There's an intimately lived-in quality to the film that feels almost documentary.",
        "Sound of Metal is a film about loss and grief, and what we do with ourselves when our lives change irrevocably.",
        "[A] mesmerizing debut ... Sound of Metal injects visceral, edgy circumstances with remarkable sensitivity.",
        "This is a very personal story to Marder and it shows in the intricate ways he uses sound to place us within Ruben\u2019s plight.",
        "With Oscar buzz surging for Riz Ahmed, the time is now to check out his virtuoso performance as a rock drummer facing deafness in a riveting, resonant film whose thrashing power and emotional gravity exert a grip that won\u2019t let go.",
        "By zooming in and out of his protagonist\u2019s consciousness, Marder casts aside any pretense of omniscience; he empathizes, but he also knows when to detach. Ruben\u2019s journey is a privilege to witness, but it\u2019s one he\u2019ll ultimately have to walk alone.",
        "Here\u2019s a film so quietly visceral it can sear through metal, \u201cquietly\u201d being the keyword. Don\u2019t come in expecting a no-holds-barred assault on the senses. Nor is this a metal music extravaganza. The bulk of the film is silent, deliberate. We are thrust inside Ruben\u2019s mind to hear what he hears, a pulsating, muted nothing, which is then jarringly contrasted with everyday sounds when we\u2019re yanked back out of his head. The sound mixing and editing are nothing short of phenomenal in Sound of Metal.",
        "This remarkably assured debut ... uses the medium of cinema to its fullest extent, both visually and aurally.",
        "Most importantly, Marder gives the audience one of the most illuminating glimpses into deaf culture to date. Working with actors who are deaf is only part of it: The rest is in details and understanding.",
        "It\u2019s a given that the sound design would be a crucial element in a film about a drummer who suddenly loses his hearing, but Sound of Metal is so artfully crafted on that front that it nearly develops a new way of experiencing a movie.",
        "It\u2019s a movie that doesn\u2019t just allow for silence but thrives in it, with Ahmed\u2019s eyes and body language charting the arc of his character. He doesn't miss a beat.",
        "The final moments, however, are all Ruben\u2019s, which is to say they\u2019re all Ahmed\u2019s, and the actor makes his character\u2019s ultimate decision feel both hard won and achingly simple. Coming out toward the end of a year of great and terrible cacophony, Sound of Metal understands the gift that is hearing and the blessings of silence alike.",
        "A movie perfectly engineered for home viewing. Particularly with the best set of headphones that you own.",
        "An experiment of sound design paired with a stellar lead performance makes for a captivating film.",
        "Marder believes devoutly in the power of actors and acting, preferring to get out of the way and let them show their stuff. Ahmed returns the favor by delivering career-best work by a wide margin.",
        "Sound of Metal is an astonishing accomplishment for both its long-nascent director and its British star, Riz Ahmed, for whom his turn as heavy metal drummer Ruben represents a career-best performance.c",
        "Marder, who co-wrote the script with his brother Abraham, sets out quite a stall with a drama that\u2019s as visceral and hard-hitting as its protagonist\u2019s drum solos.",
        "A beautifully argued parable about the need to go where life takes you, Darius Marder\u2019s debut thrives on the soul of Riz Ahmed and the bold creativity of sound designer Nicholas Becker. Together they make Sound Of Metal sing.",
        "Marder uses sound and silence as essential character elements. He offers frequent, jarring contrasts between what Ruben hears and what we do. This isn\u2019t just to emphasize what Ruben has lost. It\u2019s also a reminder: Silence can be shattering. It can also be beautiful. And it can bring peace.",
        "Propelled by a distinctive style and a potent lead performance, Darius Marder\u2019s Sound of Metal builds a singular tension between silence and noise.",
        "A sensory overload, Sound of Metal is one of the most fascinating films you\u2019ll see all year. Even when Darius Marder\u2018s lengthy character drama isn\u2019t quite working \u2013 a problem that persists in the final act \u2013 it\u2019s always engaging.",
        "A film about the sudden onset of deafness that is too attentive to specifics of character and setting to ever feel like a rote disability drama.",
        "Although the arc of the story is quite conventional in terms of Ruben\u2019s \u201cstages of death and dying\u201d journey, the script and Ahmed\u2019s affecting, sympathetic performance make us cling to the same hopes that Ruben does, that he can recover some of his hearing, maybe enough to get some of his life back.",
        "Sound of Metal tells a story about coping and overcoming while avoiding the narrative pitfall of artifice.",
        "The movie\u2019s a little sketchy and underwritten, and it feels sometimes as if scenes have been pared away or cut altogether to concentrate on Ahmed. But Ahmed really is terrific. Director Marder has a knack for both observing and igniting human behavior, through character. And supervising sound editor Nicolas Baker\u2019s work astounds, period.",
        "It\u2019s a small film made larger by Ahmed\u2019s ability to take something so interior \u2014 hearing loss \u2014 and make it so visible, so palpable.",
        "The writing leaves some unanswered questions, which viewers may interpret either as frustrating or as a reflection of the protagonist, who finds himself rudderless when he loses his hearing. Either way, Ahmed\u2019s performance goes a long way in holding the film together.",
        "Marder, who wrote the screenplay with his brother, Abraham Marder, takes far too long to get to his points in a sluggish middle but has crafted a quite lyrical tale of a man trying to find his way when everything he knows is taken away.",
        "Sound Of Metal is nothing without its sound design. It\u2019s a story about music and deafness\u2014both auditory phenomena\u2014and its success depends on being able to put you into the main character\u2019s beat-up Converse. The film does accomplish that, thanks in part to its unique, first-person approach to sound.",
        "While Sound of Metal doesn\u2019t venture to unexpected places, director Darius Marder \u2014 working from a script based on a story by \u201cBlue Valentine\u201d director Derek Cianfrance \u2014 keeps it all rooted in a heartfelt reality.",
        "Darius Marder\u2019s film captures, with urgency and tenderness, just how enticing the residue of the past can be.",
        "Sound of Metal understands the importance of immersing you in this brave new noiseless world and giving you a compelling Virgil to guide you through it, but its real strength may simply be its powers of observation.",
        "Ahmed\u2019s performance clarifies the drama and delivers the meaning of Ruben\u2019s final epiphany. He gives the film energy and point.",
        "Sound of Metal is two hours and 10 minutes long, and it moves at a snail\u2019s pace, not because \u201cnothing happens,\u201d but because Marder hasn\u2019t filled in the dramatic interior of what does happen. He has made a movie about deafness that\u2019s at once experiential and too muffled to hear."

I admired how the movie portrays theWhoa, where did this movie come from?As soon as the film started, I knew instantly I was in for an emotional ride, and I was right.'Sound of Metal' is a great movie that felt so encouraging and honest. I admired how the movie portrays the deaf community in a more positive light, because in the media it's usually misrepresented, as it often reeks of denial and self-loathing. I can tell a lot of care and effort went into this.It's very thought-provoking as well. The main character Ruben (Riz Ahmed) who is a heavy-metal drummer, where his entire life revolves around the world of sound and music, which sadly gets snatched away from him. This devastating part of his life also becomes the thing that would later define him. The silence makes him pause and consider what life can be like when we learn to accept and let things go. Not only accepting the lost of your hearing, but overcoming a nasty drug addiction. By losing apart of yourself isn't always doom and gloom after you let it sit for a while, because it can give you a brand-new perspective on things. You start to conclude that silence is heaven to the ears.Riz Ahmed delivers a terrific and heart-breaking performance as Ruben. He's the type of actor that does such a great job of making you care for his characters and here is no different. Riz has such intense, and yet expressive eyes that convey so much on what the character is feeling or thinking. Every worry, frustration, sadness, joy, and fear were all felt through his performance.Olivia Cooke, who I didn't recognize at first, also delivers a great performance as Lou, Ruben's girlfriend. There is nothing more soul crushing than watching someone you love at their lowest point both emotionally and mentally. It makes me wonder why she isn't a bigger star already, because I think she's fantastic.I like how the movie barely has a score, as the background is often incredibly quiet. The movie opens with a loud heavy metal concert blasting away it's music, but from Ruben's point of view it slowly becomes more muffled and clogged up. It just shows that a great deal of thought went into the audio and that alone made the whole thing effective. The same thing applies to Darius Marder\u2019s directing and Dani\u00ebl Bouquet cinematography; fantastic and impactful.Overall rating: Highly recommend.",

He's the drummer of a rock duo with his girlfriend who sings and plays the guitar.The problem is that Ruben is beginning to lose his hearing, so he has to accept the situation or to see if there's some way to repair the damage and return to life as he had known it until then.At that point the film becomes a sensory journey for the viewer, because accompanied by its excellent sound design, the film makes us clearly experience the situation that Ruben is facing, because like the character we hear voices and noises as if they were heard underwater.This is essential to the functioning of the film, because it makes you experience even briefly how incredibly difficult their situation is.Ruben is a recovering addict and therefore fearing a relapse he joins a group of deaf people so that Ruben can deal with both issues.Perhaps the script doesn't operate with sufficient force at that point because it doesn't explore in more depth what the experience means for the deaf community. After what I read, about how some in this community consider those who seek surgical remedies as traitors, is when I understood the message of the film better.Because Ruben wants an implant to regain his hearing, but also the film causes you to understand that there is also the possibility of facing this inevitable change and therefore reach acceptance of it.It's not that the movie is trying to romanticize deafness, but rather that even we, who will never understand it 100%, can at least be much more empathetic.Riz Ahmed is great here. This is his best performance since HBO's The Night Of.It's a pity that he didn't receive the necessary credit and that the film went unnoticed, but if you have the chance to watch it, do yourself a favor and do it.",

It's by no means exceptional, but that doesn't take away anything from its value and efficiency that, in part, rendered this movie a truly immersive experience. It's Riz Ahmed's bravura performance, though, that gives Sound of Metal resonance that, in turn, made Ruben one of the most relatable movie characters I've witnessed in recent memory. His ability to reflect his fluctuating feelings throughout the movie and how he perceives every phase in his new life is simply astonishing. The aching experience Ruben goes through demands a real acting talent to make the audience emotionally connected to the protagonist, but Ahmed proved he's not just a talented actor but also one who's in a total command of his craft. For if it's hard to make the viewer feel what his character feels, it's even harder to transport its mental state to the audience. Here, we don't only get the sense of loss and being stripped of everything that forms every inch of Ruben in a flicker, nor only do we only understand his pressing need to regain what he lost\u2014especially since the possibility hovering in the air\u2014but we see him grappling with the dilemma of whether he should continue his journey of adapting to his new condition as if it was the norm or he should keep clutching onto the flicker of hope that definitely wouldn't help in case of it turned out to be a mere mirage.Furthermore, the movie also excels in aspects other than its nuanced portrait of its main character, namely is its exploration of deaf community that truly offers new insights. That's mostly because of the effort shown in the meticulous attention to its essential components, most notably the sign language. However, Paul Raci played a major part in that by portraying the leader of this community and a mentor for Ruben. Through his facial expressions during conversations with Ruben, he delineates the professional duties such an occupation demands. We see him monitoring Ruben's progress and interfering according to his understanding of Ruben's character in particular. As for Olivia Cooke, she further proves she's a remarkable young talent that yet to bloom. Playing Ruben's bandmate and girlfriend Lou, she managed to prove how important she's to Ruben as his most great and precious loss and equally as a great help for him to get a better sense of what he has lost and how to cope with that.The acting clinic these three immense talents put on here left an indelible impression on me, but disregarding the technical quality would make absolutely no sense. Besides the exquisite sound design, the highly-articulate cinematography truly adds up to the experience. If there's only one issue I have about this movie it would be its failure to maintain the same dramatic heft that was in its first half. As the focus on Ruben's progression through his medical recovery and its consequences slightly overpowered the emotional quality, and hence there was a bit of it lost that even the wrap-up failed to fully retrieve. (8.5/10)",

I wondered why since I thought this would make it difficult for them to hear each other. This was very much not the case. If you\u2019ve everWhile hanging out with musician friends at shows I noticed that before playing, they all put in earplugs. I wondered why since I thought this would make it difficult for them to hear each other. This was very much not the case. If you\u2019ve ever been to a loud concert, it is way, way louder on stage. So, the premise of Sound of Metal, about a working-class heavy metal drummer whose world is turned upside down by sudden and profound hearing loss, is frighteningly believable. Thankfully, my friends still have their hearing. The path that Ruben, played by Riz Ahmed with one of the best performances of the year, finds himself on is abrupt and unexpected to put it mildly. Likewise, the film never quite goes where you expect, but you believe every moment and every emotion. I wasn\u2019t expecting Sound of Metal to receive 6 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, but I am very happy that it did because I cannot think of many movies from 2020 that I enjoyed more. Faced with the loss of his hearing, his livelihood, and potentially his relationship, Ruben also fears losing his four years of sobriety from heroin. In need of immediate and special help, his girlfriend and bandmate, Lou (Olivia Cooke), takes him to a sobriety house especially for the deaf. The house is run by Joe (Paul Raci), a deaf Vietnam veteran and recovering alcoholic who gives off the impression that his inner peace only came after a hard struggle. He takes Ruben under his wing but tells him that his program is about finding a solution to the problem in his mind, not his deafness. The scenes of Ruben at the deaf sober house and learning how to live without hearing are interesting and very engaging. Director Darius Marder\u2019s gentle approach to the characters and Ruben\u2019s journey gives us the feeling that we are getting a window into a real community with real people, not participating in a kind of cultural tourism.As much as I admire the approach taken by Marder\u2019s direction and the screenplay he co-wrote with his brother Abraham, Sound of Metal works so well because of Riz Ahmed\u2019s performance. This is not a case of an actor showing off their talents by playing a character with a disability. Ahmed plays a full range of emotions but the real pathos comes from his facial expressions, especially his expressive eyes. Most important of all to the movie\u2019s success, he is not afraid to show big vulnerability on screen or show just how afraid and anxious someone in this situation would feel, especially if they were a musician.Though we see Ruben getting on well at the sober house and with the larger deaf community, he still wants to have cochlear implant surgery which he believes will allow him to return to his old life. This is at odds with Joe\u2019s belief that being deaf is not a handicap or something to be fixed and leads to one of the most compelling and affecting scenes of the movie; one that likely earned Ahmed and Raci their Oscar nominations. It is easily one of the best moments in any movie I saw over the last year. I will admit that I was hesitant to watch Sound of Metal at first, despite its positive reviews, because a movie about a young musician going deaf seems like a heavy or even depressing movie. However, Sound of Metal ends up being an uplifting film without delving into melodrama or smarmy sentiment. Every aspect of this movie is low-key, allowing every moment to feel genuine. This is not the kind of movie with twists but it does have unexpected narrative turns which are best left to be discovered along with Ruben. All of the unexpected places, both physical and emotional, the story takes us are what make it memorable. The empathy in the performances from Paul Raci, Olivia Cooke, Mathieu Amalric, and, most of all, Riz Ahmed are what make it so moving. Sound of Metal is something special: a film so seemingly simple but deeply affecting. It is a character study so well executed that it transcends its premise and puts us so in tune with the main character that its final moments become spiritual, or philosophical, depending on your inclination.",

This drama is thoroughly engaging as itSound of Metal is a story about Ruben (Riz Ahmed), a drummer in a metal band who begins to suffer from severe hearing loss, and the film takes us on his journey through such a life-changing event. This drama is thoroughly engaging as it features a great story, top-tier acting performances, an intriguing theme, as well as probably the best sound design of the year. (Warning: Spoilers Ahead)The flow of the story is constant and feels highly realistic, which kept me thoroughly locked in on the characters and wondering where the plot was headed next. With Riz Ahmed's character at the center of the film, he shows off some top-tier acting while portraying the raw emotions that Ruben is going through, making the audience feel every bit of anger, frustration, and other emotions on this rocky road on the path to acceptance of his hearing loss. The theme of acceptance is where the movie genuinely excelled since it hammers home that being deaf is not a problem at all, it is our thoughts about it, wherein lies the real problem. The driving force of this great message certainly has to be Joe (played by Paul Raci), who is a teacher at the deaf community that Ruben joins. His calm, collected, and soothing persona provides the film with the perfect guide for both Ruben and anyone watching the film on the path to enlightenment. Changing the way that Ruben thinks about his 'problem', was the only solution to finding his inner stillness, and letting go of all the negative emotions he was dealing with.Now, even though there's more than enough reason to watch this movie from the details provided above, what takes the cake as the element which weaves the entire film together, is the exceptional sound design. The sound throughout the film is fused seamlessly with the story elements and emotional landscape of every scene. From the simple sounds of breathing or body movement to the simulated screechy noise that Ruben experiences after getting hearing implants, all the way to the moment of silence, the craft behind the use of sound in this film was world-class.",

Upon the suggestion from Prime Video, I watched Sound of Metal,Yes, winter movie season is in full swing. It seems like there are so many great offerings every weekend on multiple platforms. A plethora of opportunities for entertainment. Upon the suggestion from Prime Video, I watched Sound of Metal, which premiered on the platform on December 4, 2020. Here's why it was such a worthwhile experience.The plot of Sound of Metal is pretty simple - it's a drama starring Riz Amhed as a heavy metal drummer whose life takes an unexpected turn when he begins to lose his hearing. Ahmed plays the drummer, Ruben, who is part of the heavy mental duo with his girlfriend played by Olivia Cooke, and their music career seems to be going along smoothly. But, as a recovering addict, the hearing loss sends Ruben into a tailspin. As directed by Darius Marder, the crux of the film is how Ruben copes with the monumental change in his life and the emotions that he goes through, will he be able to hear again, will his relationship survive, will he survive and so many deep and devastating questions. It's not just a typical movie about an addict - though that is an important part. The film also dives into questions of identity and what makes us who we are - or who we think we are.All of these questions hinge on the strength of the performances of Ahmed, Cooke and Paul Raci. Raci plays a sponsor, or mentor of sorts, to Ruben as he deals with his addiction and his hearing loss. Ahmed plays Ruben so well. There's so much passion, and fear, felt throughout film. The success of the film really rests on Ahmed's shoulders and he carries it well. Cooke is very good as the girlfriend and bandmate. It's understandable why she may be a motivating factor for Ruben. Raci is very impactful in his part too. He's stern, thoughtful and makes a necessary contrast to Ruben. There's a lot of care in each of these performances and they grow as the movie goes along. These characters are really well-rounded and provide a strong foundation for this emotional story.If you are looking for a good, emotional movie to watch, Sound of Metal is a worthy contender. Riz Ahmed's performance is one people will be talking about for the rest of the year. Grab a big box of popcorn and don't miss this movie.",
