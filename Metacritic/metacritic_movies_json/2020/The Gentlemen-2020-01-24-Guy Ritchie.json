    "summary": "The Gentlemen follows American expat Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) who built a highly profitable marijuana empire in London. When word gets out that he's looking to cash out of the business forever it triggers plots, schemes, bribery and blackmail in an attempt to steal his domain out from under him.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "The Gentlemen never ceases to surprise and amuse.",
        "Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen plays like a tall tale, a yarn heard at the corner pub, filled with exaggerations and embellishments, where the storyteller expects you to pay his bar tab at the end. And maybe you won't mind doing so.",
        "The dialogue, the violence, the humor (largely provided by Grant\u2019s character) and the intricacy of the storytelling make for a picture in which most everyone in it seems to be having a great deal of chatty, bloody fun.",
        "But like he seems to do with every project these days, Grant runs away with the movie.",
        "The result is a sequence of events that\u2019s both intriguing and gossamer-thin. You enjoy the challenge of figuring out who\u2019s doing what to whom and for what devious reasons, but it all goes out of your head once the story ends and the lights come up.",
        "For those that persevere, there is an entertaining gangster film at the heart of The Gentlemen. There's a frenetic energy to Ritchie's movie that comes in part from his directing style, and part from the cast's clear enjoyment of bringing the film to life.",
        "Featuring a stellar ensemble cast headed by Matthew McConaughey, Hugh Grant, Charlie Hunnam, Michelle Dockery and Colin Farrell, Ritchie's homecoming is a fairly familiar affair, but also refreshingly funny and deftly plotted, with more witty lines and less boorish machismo than his early work.",
        "The Gentlemen is nothing if not a callback to the Locks of yesteryear, star-stacked and defibrillated with enough juice to jolt a gorilla out of cardiac arrest.",
        "The Gentlemen [is] just stocked with an inordinately good cast. Filled with crosses and double crosses, the plot is mostly irrelevant, but the outlandish flourishes make for a good deal of foul-mouthed fun.",
        "Ritchie doesn\u2019t handle the messages he wishes to impart as skillfully as he could \u2014 instead, he\u2019s preoccupied with revisiting the beats that made his acclaimed gangster films work best: the sleek style, the staccato rhythm, the casual hyperviolence that begets more violence and an occasional laugh.",
        "It\u2019s a diverting if slightly undercooked throwback that could offer more genuine intrigue, but that\u2019s still worth it to see the cast gamely chuck out the window manners and vanity.",
        "Ritchie\u2019s strengths as a filmmaker don\u2019t include developing complex female personalities so Dockery\u2019s Rosalind is more like a male fantasy caricature of a strong woman than an actual character.",
        "Finally, there\u2019s Colin Farrell, who plays a boxing coach called Coach, who tries to keep his Jamaican-English charges on, if not the straight and narrow, the straighter and narrower. He and his lads all wear plaid tracksuits, and it\u2019s a testament to Farrell that he makes this feel entirely natural rather than stunty. He is an underrated master who can do no wrong, and I wish this movie starred him.",
        "Ritchie papers over a paper-thin story with artificial twists and very funny turns by the likes of Farrell, Grant, Marsan and Dockery.",
        "The Gentlemen is so blinkered by its outdated (and often offensive) alpha male perspective that it's blind to the elements that could have made it great.",
        "A funny, violent, rambunctious shaggy-dog story of a crime caper featuring an ensemble cast studded with colorful characters played by name actors. In other words, it\u2019s more \u201cSnatch\u201d than \u201cAladdin,\u201d which was only the latest of Ritchie\u2019s misbegotten attempts to achieve mainstream respect by retelling someone else\u2019s stories.",
        "Ritchie may not be exploring uncharted territory, but you can bet it was more fun to make The Gentlemen than it was to make \u201cAladdin\u201d or \u201cKing Arthur: Legend of the Sword.\u201d It\u2019s more fun to watch \u201cThe Gentleman\u201d than those films, too.",
        "Ritchie makes a solid return to his wheelhouse with a crime yarn that turns the air so blue you can swim in it.",
        "What it lacks in freshness and depth, The Gentlemen certainly makes up for in cartoon-y bluster and fun details.",
        "The Gentlemen is a valiant, often raucous bid to drag the tried-and-true old Ritchie formula into the present, and while the result feels like he got about as far as 2005 \u2013 with lip-service acknowledgements of grime music and YouTube \u2013 for the purposes of this film, it\u2019s close enough.",
        "Ritchie has made an entertaining return to his mockney roots.",
        "Too often, The Gentlemen creaks through the motions of Ritchie\u2019s patented vision, absent the spark necessary to bring his fast-paced action and profane zingers to life. It\u2019s like watching a reunited band struggle to recapture the energy of its glory days.",
        "Ritchie is looking back to the Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and RocknRolla roots as if nothing has changed since. The Gentlemen is simply those movies with extra everything except inspiration. And sometimes more is less.",
        "The Gentlemen is a mongrel of a movie. There are not enough twists and tangles for a proper mystery, not enough thrills for an action flick, and not enough laughs for a comedy.",
        "If Ritchie had been willing to reflect on his relationship to his own body of work a bit more \u2013 the tropes of British gangster films that he himself helped create \u2013 then perhaps The Gentlemen could\u2019ve found that next gear that would\u2019ve made it something truly special. Instead, Ritchie\u2019s film proves he might be best served by walking away from the genre entirely.",
        "Hunnam\u2019s presence, alone, keeps the movie grounded. But the movie time and time again exalts the gallantry of its gentlemen heroes at the expense of those unlike them. It gives this glass of Gritchie\u2019s English Lore a bitter taste.",
        "As an evening\u2019s entertainment, it\u2019s almost passable \u2014 genially diverting one minute, sour and self-satisfied the next. As a men\u2019s fashion showcase, it\u2019s exemplary \u2014 a parade of neatly tailored charcoal waistcoats, colorful flannel tracksuits and a lovely ribbed cardigan that Charlie Hunnam wears like a second skin.",
        "The point is cleverness and looking cool, though, mostly the movie is about Ritchie\u2019s own conspicuous pleasure directing famous actors having a lark, trading insults, making mischief. There\u2019s not much else, which depending on your mood and the laxity of your ethical qualms, might be enough.",
        "In something as herky-jerky and convoluted as The Gentlemen, the viewer has enough to worry about keeping the whole story straight without dreading the next tone-deaf thing to come out of an esteemed character actor\u2019s mouth.",
        "Visually unexceptional when it\u2019s not plain squalid, shameless in its bid for a sequel, The Gentlemen is the film Britain deserves as it staggers backwards into the New Year under the questionable influence of an unabashedly populist leader.",
        "For a filmmaker who used to make these movies with a measure of anarchic glee, Ritchie appears to have bought into his own bullshit here.",
        "It should be fun \u2013 but it isn\u2019t. Ritchie, who wrote the screenplay from a story he conceived with Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies, veers into territory that\u2019s possibly anti-Semitic and maybe a little racist. It\u2019s all a lark, so we\u2019re not supposed to care, but some of the gags still leave a bitter aftertaste.",
        "Take away the confusing plot and throwaway punchlines and the cast is by far the best part of the film \u2014 and the reason many will go see it. If only they were part of a different movie. The Gentlemen doesn't live up to the hype.",
        "The result isn\u2019t exactly Lock, Stock Redux. Only the \u201cstock\u201d part remains.",
        "Movies shouldn\u2019t have to meet a PC checklist so they won\u2019t offend \u2013 who wants that kind of cinema? \u2013 but when they poke you in the eye one too many times, it\u2019s fair game to poke back.",
        "The movie doesn\u2019t end up going anywhere and serves as little more than an excuse to get the movie\u2019s stars into dapper suits and flat caps.",
        "Guy Ritchie\u2019s latest gangster comedy presents itself as a harmless romp, but behind its wink-wink-nudge-nudge humour is a bitter and dated worldview.",
        "The Gentlemen is a disposable crime caper on autopilot. Propped up by an all-star ensemble, particularly the sturdy Charlie Hunnam and scene-stealer Colin Farrell, Guy Ritchie reclaims the genre that brought him to fame but does little more than shuffle battered parts into an intermittently entertaining configuration.",
        "The actors, splendidly kitted out in autumnal suiting and knitwear by costume designer Michael Wilkinson, have what fun they can with such thin, dated material, but everyone here deserves better.",
        "For all its energy and vulgarity, The Gentlemen is a slog, a tedious and unnecessarily unpleasant tour of ground that Ritchie\u2019s already covered.",
        "Of course, the real problem here isn\u2019t that Ritchie isn\u2019t Noel Coward, but that he\u2019s not clever or funny in his own right. The Gentleman isn\u2019t offensive, and it\u2019s not even good enough to qualify as coarse. If it weren\u2019t mildly annoying, it would be as close to nothing as an experience can be.",
        "The London of this film is practically a match for Guy Ritchie\u2019s filmmaking: a characterless mockery of its former glories, smooth and bland and just a bit more monied than before.",
        "It was written with empty-headed desperation and directed with minimal imagination by Guy Ritchie, one of the most incompetent filmmakers of the century."

Anemic is actually an understatement. If you can make it through the first half hour without using your popcorn bag as a receptacle for the contents of your stomach, then you, like most of the viewing public at this point in the history of humanity, have lost all ability to discriminate...notice the difference between inspired creativity and a desperate formula. Matthew McConaughey is who he always is in every film, unwatchable. The script is supposed to be engrossing but it just doesn't deliver. It's like a train off the rails the entire time, plowing forward anyway, grating noise, going nowhere. The plot and dialogue are so utterly contrived and lame that I actually felt sorry for the actors, some of whom are quite talented, struggle to bring vitality to this total P.O.S. I can't even finish my review because it is making me ill to recall everything worth criticizing, suffice to say that this is more a public service announcement to not waste your time.

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThe Gentlemen is done dirty by a January opening. It's an April, at least. The movie is more of an experiment in ASMR sexual harassment on the part of some attractive no good doers from Ritchie's past projects. The story is a bit of a mousetrap of chronologies and unreliable narration, which makes it fun and tightly packed, well-paced, and oddly both more and less self-aware than some of his previous projects.I have a soft and blind spot for Guy Ritchie films. I don't usually know I'm watching one unless Charlie Hunnam is in it. I've passively consumed a lot of Ritchie's big budget films in my childhood and early adolescence. I am continually surprised by the ways that his aesthetic both parodies and plays along with some themes of toxic masculinity: the gestures toward gay- and race-baiting for humor, the way that self-aware British culture clashes with American sensibilities about masculinity, and the unexpected joy of a bro-y film that doesn't need to feel like a game of Cards Against Humanity with your edgelord friends from college. The Gentlemen is a who's who of Ritchie's oeuvre of caper and gangster flicks along with actors on the rise like Henry Golding and Michelle Dockery (of Downton fame), and Matthew McConnaughey saucily eye-fing the camera the entire movie. Spoilers ahead. Ritchie makes moves toward metatheatrical storytelling in his editing, his occasional illustrated captioning, an inset narrative, and the not-so-subtle parables wrapped in trailer material. The opening shot of this movie, in which McConnaughey dies, is startling, and the rewind and reconstruction of events, which has the room for embellishment and authorial focalization, are elements of novel direction, but there are other things that are less innovative, notably the rape threat, which amounts to maybe the biggest missed opportunity for a rewind. One cannot help but think of moments like these as unforced errors. It's not our job to explain away the sloppiness of these choices for \"time\" or \"movie length,\" because when you're movie has a full on music video of fight porn, you lose the excuse of having trimmed the plot to its barest bones. It can't be fun to be the critic finger wagging at the twee racist jokes of a much beloved genre director of dark comedies. I expect that everyone's sensitivities will be tested at some point or another in this movie, but I'm personally a lot less guilty about laughing at the casually racist jokes in this movie than I am about the constant undercurrent of faux homosexual tension that's pervasive in this movie. If this is a directorial decision that's supposed to satirize the BDE of the genre heroes, I am open in being persuaded to like it. In terms of fun ways that Ritchie defuses my anxieties about racist accents and the rest: the movement of our sympathies from the first time we meet The Toddlers and their original entry versus the final scenes or the Three Strikes joke (I'm reading this in my notes, I don't know what these means anymore) shows how Ritchie can play on our expectations of what a Bro-y movie with a lot of Anglo strongmen would think about a bunch of black and brown tykes with GoPros strapped to their heads. Even the way that Colin Ferrell educates the kids in the shop is an excellent twist to his own character, because it feels like he's toying with some inner city hooligans, in part, to deflate their egos, but we then learn that this is sort of his whole deal. The way Ferrell responds to his Toddlers when they ask, \"Is everything OK, Coach?\" with \"No, it's not fine\" and admonishment for their past actions does a lovely job of injecting their relationship with the pathos of a mentor. I guess there's some insidious racism implicit in the idea that the only thing standing between these boys and crime is a rough tongued Irishman, but honestly the conversation on race that the Coach and his student have does enough to show that the film is at least aware of criticism. Laugh out loud moments in this movie were reserved for the dragon fable and it\u2019s rewind--Wife and Friend were both tickled by it and Wife went in unaware of the trailer, so I think it was doubly funny for her. The rewinds on Dry Eye's introduction are a way of being able to build character for the narrator and create a sense that our story is unreliable. The way that the inset narrative eventually leads to the present moment of storytelling is an excellent control of plot. The foiling of blackmail and new relationships that are blended together post the journalist's initial run through of the story makes for a powerful second act. I like the twisty chronology of the beginning moment of the McConnaughey's murder and the way that Hugh Grant's twist with the Russian oligarch changes the trajectory of the story. Might have to think on this one a little harder, but I definitely recommend.",

(2000). And yes, the film seems stuck in the last decade in more ways than one, it's highly questionable that the only gay character is a slimy man-whore into S&M, its only female character barely even manages to rise to the level of tokenism, and Ritchie does absolutely nothing new here, but The Gentlemen is still hugely entertaining. Most of the jokes land, the dialogue is as sharp and expletive-laden as ever, the cast are having a ball, and the self-reflexivity works well for the most part. The plot is as derivative as it gets, but Ritchie has injected real verve into it. The Gentlemen won't change your life, but it will make you laugh.The film begins as sleazy private eye Fletcher (Hugh Grant) arrives unannounced at the home of Ray (Charlie Hunnam), right-hand man to Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), an Oxford-educated American ex-pat who controls a huge marijuana empire in London. Several months prior, Fletcher was hired by tabloid editor Big Dave (Eddie Marsen) to dig up dirt on Pearson, and Fletcher has written a screenplay based on his investigation, telling Ray that unless Pearson pays him \u00a320 million, he will hand over everything he has to Dave. Meanwhile, Pearson has decided to sell his whole operation, but when word gets out, all hell breaks loose, as the various interested parties vie for advantage. Most of the subsequent film takes the form of Fletcher narrating his exploits to Ray, explaining how he learned so much about Pearson and what he does.Aesthetically, The Gentlemen is very much in the mould of Ritchie's previous gangster movies. Because Fletcher frames his narration as a screenplay, it allows Ritchie to employ a multitude of self-reflexive devices \u2013 a smash cut coinciding with Fletcher asking Ray to visualise a smash cut; on-screen captions telling us who's who; animated maps; freeze-frames; rewinds; a shot of film running through a projector etc. At one point, Fletcher is discussing the merits of anamorphic over 1.78:1, and the film's aspect ratio changes accordingly. At another, he's arguing for the merits of 35mm celluloid over digital, and the film duly switches formats. Such playfulness means that it never for a second takes itself too seriously, and it remains immensely fun, with the more you know about the mechanics of assembling a film, the more humorously self-reflexive the film becomes \u2013 Fletcher even acknowledges his own role as an unreliable narrator.In terms of themes, the most obvious is the idea that the economic divide between gangsters and aristocrats masks their practical similarities. The smooth running of Pearson's business depends on both classes \u2013 the aristocrats who he needs to grow his product and the gangsters who distribute that product. The clash between the pompous insularity of the English upper class and the perceived uncouthness of the lower class has been done to death in both literature (Wuthering Heights (1847) springs to mind) and film (Performance, for example), and although Ritchie doesn't say anything even remotely new about it, it still forms an interesting textural background \u2013 gentrification is ever-present; there are ironic references to the posh areas of Croydon; Ray, a working-class Newcastle native, is a cleanliness freak who eats wagyu steak and lives in a mansion, and when he's dispatched on a mission to an uncivilised working-class area, he explains he \"just hates them junkies,\" seeing them as very much his social inferiors.One of the most central scenes sees Ray and his mn clash with a gang of machete-wielding thugs on a council estate, and there's a real sense of old vs. new \u2013 traditional gangsters fighting it out with internet-savvy hoodlums who don't give a damn about tradition or respect. There are a lot of laughs to be had with these issues, such as Ray and Coach (a scene-stealing Colin Farrell) having problems pronouncing the name Phuc. And again, none of this is presented as even remotely serious.The biggest problems with the film are probably its lack of depth, and the familiarity of the presentation, characters, and milieu \u2013 there's nothing here you haven't seen in previous Ritchie films. And as you would expect, there isn't much in the way of emotional maturity or narrative complexity. It's all very surface-level, and it makes no apologies for such.Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed The Gentlemen. It's a funny as hell caper and the actors are clearly having terrific fun. It might be formulaic and overly familiar, but it's also immensely enjoyable.",

Matthew McConaughey stars as the king of the streets and delivers a great performance that demands the screen like no other as they twist and turn through the mystery of the story. The pace tends to slow a bit but is never boring due to the writing and sheer madness of the characters we meet throughout.

When he decides to sell it, all manner of schemes comprise the twisty plot. Given that the director is Guy Ritchie, whose career started with this kind of brash, violent, streetwise scenario, it's interesting to see him back at it. Albeit, a bit more restrained in the pacing and violence. There's still plenty of fun in some of the characterizations (esp. Hugh Grant) and some moments of cinematic snazz. Even though Ritchie has certainly mellowed a bit, he hasn't lost his ability to craft an enjoyable, offbeat caper.",

As someone who's clung so unabashedly to the notion that his \"Sherlock Holmes\" films are the best things he's ever done, I was wary of this return to the early days for Ritchie. I don't particularly dislike movies like \"Lock, Stock,\" \"Snatch\" or \"RocknRolla.\" I just find them a bit too showy and brash for my tastes. However, it seems the skills accrued via those jaunts through studio-dom have perhaps melded with the indie sensibilities that were already so present within the man. And the movie's all better for it. Yes, \"The Gentlemen\" is still undeniably Ritchie, but with just the right amount of focus, tact and accessibility to make even the most fervent of Ritchie-deniers leave the theater feeling satisfied. As shocked as I am to say this, I have to admit - I honestly think this is my favorite of the \"proper\" Guy Ritchie gangster flicks.",

However, things go awry when his empire is threatened. This was a fun film.This is directed and written by Guy Ritchie, and like his Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and, I believe, some of his other crime films (I haven't seen the rest) it relies on a lot of characters and twists-and-turns. What results is a good helping interesting moving parts, dialogue, and performances from great actors.The script isn't quite as tight as LS&TSB. The movie could've been a bit shorter. The character of a tabloid editor played by Eddie Marsan could've been cut without effecting anything. I also felt the last scene missed a bit of a punch.The previous criticisms are more nitpicks than major issues. Overall, this movie is a good time and I recommend it.

The cast and premise of this film were enough to intrigue me to give this latest outing of his a go. Matthew McConaughey plays an American-born drug lord residing in England, who plans to retire and sell off his business. However, it doesn't go so simply, as he's marked for death by many hitmen and criminals who want in on his fortune and position of power, which in turn, involves various other criminals throughout England. The cast is easily the best thing about this film! McConaughey gives an always reliably charismatic lead performance, along with some rather humorous supporting turns from Charlie Hunnam, Colin Farrell, and Hugh Grant to name a few. The action and fights are quite fun to watch, and there are some funny moments to be had. However, story-wise, it came up a bit short for me. Things get a little overly convoluted and the movie dragged itself out a little longer than I would've liked. The film took its time with a couple plot points longer than necessary too in my eyes. Overall, it's a welcome return to form for Guy Ritchie, as he's mainly been focusing on big budget fare like 'King Arthur' and the live-action 'Aladdin' as of late, and there's some funny lines and moments throughout, but the story's a little too convoluted and dragged out for its own good that it didn't quite justify the handful of moments I did enjoy. I anticipate those who are bigger fans of Ritchie's British crime films will enjoy it a little more than I did.",

It\u2019s crazy to think that this is the same guy who brought us last years \u2018Aladdin.\u2019 But this time Ritchie isn\u2019t on a leash.I honestly didn\u2019t expect to enjoy \u2018The Gentleman\u2019 as much as I did. A little muddle and sometimes confusing to follow, but the movie has a certain sharpness to it that kept me interested throughout. It\u2019s more in vein with \u2018Lock Shock\u2019 and \u2018Snatch\u2019. Ritchie has made a successful career being influenced by the work of Quentin Tarantino, hence his given title \u201cBritish Tarantino\u201d. The cast are all having an absolute blast with the material and I can tell everyone wants to be there. Hugh Grant is my personal favorite out of the cast and it\u2019s great to see his enthusiasm in acting again. He plays Fletcher, a gay detective who documents the events in the story into a screenplay he\u2019s writing, so in a way it\u2019s told from his perspective. While debatable if everything in the movie was made up or not, cause \u201cevery movie needs a bit of action\u201d. The thing I love about Grants performance is that he isn\u2019t playing \"typical Hugh Grant\", but an actual character. Although I thought the running gag of him being openly gay and constantly makes flirty hints towards other male characters got old and awkward after awhile. A joke that out stay\u2019s it\u2019s welcome...kinda like Fletcher.I\u2019m not a big fan of Charlie Hunnam as an actor, as I usually find him bland in everything I\u2019ve seen him so far. However I thought Hunnam delivered a solid performance in this movie and might be his best. He plays Ray, Mickey\u2019s (McConaughey) right hand man who is professional when it comes to business despite the countless idiots in his path. Imagine Russell Bufalino from \u2018The Irishman\u2019, but more physical and incredibly British. His comedic timing was pretty good as well that maybe if you give him the right material and character, he\u2019s a better actor than I thought.Colin Farrell was terrific as Coach and my second favorite out of the cast. He\u2019s ridiculously cool and shows who\u2019s boss, but also display\u2019s some comedic chops. Matthew McConaughey was chilled as Mickey, who is the weed Lord of England that likes things in green, which is money and marijuana. Out of all the colorful characters in the movie, I thought Mickey was the least interesting if I have to be honest. Either because of McConaughey's chilled nature or the less exciting material given to his character. The style and overall tone of the movie made the whole experience so fun to watch. Everything about the movie is quick. The dialogue is snappy and there\u2019s plenty of clever banter between characters. It\u2019s incredibly clear that Guy Richie loves cinema whenever he\u2019s not held back like some of his previous projects and gets to freely express his passion behind the craft. The humor and jokes ain't for the faint of heart, but luckily I\u2019m not that soft. Some of jokes didn\u2019t quite land the mark and often times left me puzzled in terms of waiting for the punchline. Overall rating: A disjointed, but entertaining movie. Misleading title though. There\u2019s plenty of man, but not so much on gentle.",
