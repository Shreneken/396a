    "critic_reviews": [
        "Writer-director Aaron Sorkin's star-studded chronicle of The Trial of the Chicago 7 is timely and terrific.",
        "You\u2019ll find that out in the film\u2019s last \u2014 and best \u2014 moment, which belongs to Redmayne. Is it sentimental? You betcha. But it sure takes you back to the TV magic of President Bartlet.",
        "Certain events are rearranged from the factual timelines, and yes, The Trial of the Chicago 7 exercises poetic license. This is not a documentary; it\u2019s a dramatization of events that resonates with great power while containing essential truths, and it\u2019s one of the best movies of the year.",
        "Since theaters basically ceased to exist, there\u2019s been a few movies I\u2019ve watched screeners at home and have really, really enjoyed. But this is the first that made me feel like I was back in a theater. This felt like a real event. That I got those chills down the back as I watched something I\u2019m just loving for the first time of what will be many times.",
        "Sorkin takes a rather dense, complicated court case\u2014one peopled with figures who clung to stubborn differences even in the context of their shared ideals\u2014and keeps it aloft every minute, as if he were following the aerodynamic principles of hang-gliding rather than moviemaking. Best of all, he brings out the best each actor in this enormous ensemble cast has to offer; every character is rendered with jewelers-loupe clarity.",
        "Aaron Sorkin\u2019s The Trial of the Chicago 7 is the rare drama about the 1960s that\u2019s powerful and authentic and moving enough to feel as if it were taking place today.",
        "The Trial of the Chicago 7 is something unexpected, fun. Sorkin trusts his instincts. Maybe real life has made it so that nothing seems over the top anymore. Whatever the case, it makes the film something else, too: timely.",
        "As in any Sorkin joint there are at least three lines of dialogue that might make your eyes roll into the back of your head and your body produce an involuntary groan so extended that you will likely have to rewind. But it just goes to show how good the rest of it is that a few clunkers could stick out that much.",
        "It is Sorkin\u2019s film\u2019s sense of \u201cright now\u201d that sticks with you.",
        "The fall awards season roars in with this cinema powder keg. Expect Oscar to sprinkle gold dust on writer-director Aaron Sorkin and a gangbusters cast  for making this recreation of a notorious 1969 trial burn with a timely relevance that singes the screen.",
        "Although The Trial of the Chicago 7 has a serious message, it finds room for moments of (dark) comedy and (gallows) humor.",
        "His characters are the brightest, slickest people you will ever meet, and whether you\u2019re meant to love or loathe them, Sorkin has a genuine talent for ensuring his heroes and villains will forever stick in your head, wandering the recesses of your mind in an eternal walk-and-talk formation.",
        "Briskly paced, bristling with Sorkin\u2019s distinctive verbal fusillades, seamlessly blending conventional courtroom procedural with protest reenactments and documentary footage (including Wexler\u2019s), The Trial of the Chicago 7 offers an absorbing primer in a chapter of American history that was both bizarre and ruefully meaningful.",
        "The Trial of the Chicago 7 moves beyond Sorkin the writer of dialogue, or Sorkin the supplier of scripts to the likes of Rob Reiner, David Fincher and Danny Boyle, to Sorkin the filmmaker.",
        "The filmmaker crafts an entertaining, immersive and ultimately optimistic spectacle that never forgets, especially at its ending, that humanity should always trump the system.",
        "The film seesaws between being a persuasive argument for standing up for what\u2019s right and simply being an actor\u2019s showcase.",
        "Given The Trial of the Chicago 7\u2019s snapshot of an era of an almost hopelessly divided America, and Kafka-esque and monstrous misuse of power by a bullying President, the timing for its release couldn\u2019t be better.",
        "Clearly Sorkin sees the Chicago 7 as victims of the vilification of dissent. He also sees them as exemplars \u2013 this is his version of a superhero movie \u2013 and the idealization at times gets a bit sticky.",
        "The Trial of the Chicago 7 makes for an entertaining and compelling courtroom drama, bolstered by Sorkin's script and strong performances.",
        "It advances no cutting-edge ideas and pushes no cinematic boundaries. But watching it at a moment when the majority of the population is moving leftward while our institutions are held hostage by a far-right minority \u2014 and when police violence continues, unchecked and unprosecuted, in the streets \u2014 provides the vicarious pleasure of watching a bunch of hyperarticulate progressives speak truth to power, and it feels pretty damn good, even if they do all talk a lot like Aaron Sorkin.",
        "Not only does it represent some of Sorkin\u2019s best work for years, but in this time of civil unrest and with the dark clouds of November nearly upon is, this reminder of the right to resist the state could not be timelier.",
        "This is a film that examines both the past and the present day; that plots a path on the common ground between them.",
        "An emotionally tough watch \u2013 though an exhilarating one tahnks to Aaron Sorkin's reliably taught script and direction",
        "A fiery condemnation of the police state and government overreach, this is both timely and timeless. Sorkin and a superb cast make legal proceedings compelling, and then show that the law is an ass.",
        "The Trial of the Chicago 7 is both a courtroom drama for the ages and an urgent shot across the bows.",
        "Sorkin has made a movie that's gripping, illuminating and trenchant, as erudite as his best work and always grounded first and foremost in story and character.",
        "It all comes back to Sorkin's core idea, implicitly and expertly expressed: that the tactic of violence and provocation, then making the victims seem like thugs, is still performed in Portland and St. Louis and New York, just as it was in Chicago. It's also a reminder that there was no Chicago 7 until the establishment brought them together.",
        "Written and directed by Aaron Sorkin, the subject brings out everything that\u2019s good about Sorkin\u2019s writing \u2014 not just the clever banter, which is a constant delight, but his way of conveying who the good and bad guys are without succumbing to hero worship or moral posturing.",
        "It looks and sounds great, but should it?",
        "\"Trial\u201d is so inherently compelling \u2014 and so directly germane to an America where the government labels cities \u201canarchist jurisdictions\u201d and states are drawing up laws against free assembly \u2014 that it doesn\u2019t need the frills. Let the kids know what happened the way it happened. They can handle the truth.",
        "From a movie-making perspective, The Trial of the Chicago 7 is sturdy but not particularly revelatory. But as a delivery system for great performers rattling off great dialogue, it\u2019s almost unbeatable.",
        "Chicago 7 frames the past not just as entertaining prologue but a living document; one we ignore at our own peril.",
        "Sorkin\u2019s writing may be better served by a director who can bring a new set of perspectives and dynamics to the work, rather than simply presenting them head-on. Yet it works anyway. The actors win on appeal. And it\u2019s always worth revisiting this particular chapter of Chicago unrest and injustice, because that chapter, tragically, is always up for another rewrite.",
        "The Trial of the Chicago 7 is exactly as advertised \u2014 a giant, giddy burst of earnest theatricality, loaded with a formidable ensemble that chews on every inch of the scenery, that overall makes a passionate case for the resilience of its formula more than using it as an excuse.",
        "Chicago 7 is a particularly shiny rendering of history, but Sorkin wisely places the focus on America\u2019s failings, even as he celebrates the people striving to fix them.",
        "Mr. Sorkin\u2019s film is sometimes eloquent, and sustained for the most part by his flair for hyperverbal entertainment. Yet it also diminishes its aura of authenticity with dubious inventions, and muddles its impact by taking on more history than it can handle.",
        "The Trial of the Chicago 7 feels timely in an at-times jolting way, with images of chaos in the streets and angry crowds chanting \"The whole world is watching.\" At its core, though, writer-director Aaron Sorkin takes the \"trial\" part to heart, leading to a largely courtroom-bound affair that -- while entertaining and splendidly cast -- at its best echoes his early triumph with \"A Few Good Men.\"",
        "This film is one of those exhilarating instances when Sorkin finds a context in which all of his well-established impulses that can be so annoying elsewhere \u2014 the self-righteousness, the straw men, the great men, the men who aren\u2019t onstage but are nevertheless digging deep in their diaphragms to deliver their lines to the back row \u2014 actually work.",
        "This courtroom drama has its florid excesses, but a fine cast (combined with Sorkin\u2019s indefatigable enthusiasm for electric, shamelessly proselytising entertainment) sell the commentary at this still-relevant story\u2019s centre.",
        "The Trial of the Chicago 7, smoothly entertaining as it is, may also elude clear consensus. Democracy is a messy business, but an element of real, lived-in messiness seems beyond this movie\u2019s purview.",
        "Despite Sorkin\u2019s significant shortcomings as a director, The Trial of the Chicago 7 hums along mightily on the strength of its god-tier ensemble and whip-smart script. There\u2019s hardly a false note in the cast, all of them capably handling Sorkin\u2019s overlapping, erudite dialogue with aplomb, and many of the big moments land with a splash.",
        "While many will draw parallels between scenes involving civil unrest to the events of 2020, the philosophical differences between Hayden and Abbie \u2014 cultural versus electoral revolution, respectively \u2014 ring closely to the debates raging within progressive politics today, and actually prove more interesting.",
        "It pulses with relevancy in a time when debates over authoritarianism, protests, and the necessity of radicalism are convulsing America.",
        "I don\u2019t think, on balance, that this is a very good movie. It\u2019s talky and clumsy, alternating between self-importance and clowning. But it\u2019s also not a movie that can be easily shaken off. Partly this is an accident of timing.",
        "The Trial Of The Chicago 7 wants to bottle the revolutionary spirit of its setting\u2014the take-to-the-streets idealism of the \u201960s\u2014but its snappy montage-glimpses of demonstrations verge on costume-party kitsch. The movie is at its best and most persuasive in the courtroom, when Sorkin can draw on the clashes of ideology and personality.",
        "This is too neat, tidy, and digestible of a take on such a wrenching topic\u2014especially when we know the forces of injustice at work here were only temporarily stymied by this trial, and hardly defeated.",
        "Instead, by reshaping this charged moment culled from somewhat recent American history in his own image, Sorkin has made The Trial of the Chicago 7 about something else entirely: himself.",
        "Sorkin doesn\u2019t face these evils for more than a moment at a time. He doesn\u2019t even try to convert the uninitiated, but his movie thinks it does. His script and direction gaze rather than observe, and by the time the score swells and the requisite title cards inform the viewer of its leads\u2019 fates, The Trial of the Chicago 7 has brought virtually nothing to light.",
        "He [Sorkin] can also become fantastically ponderous, bloated with finger-waggingly self-important liberal patriotism. Sadly, that is the tone with this exasperatingly dull, dramatically inert and faintly misjudged re-creation of the \u201cChicago Seven\u201d trial in the US, which Sorkin has written and directed."

And it's a potent reminder of the rampant thuggery among U.S. police forces, which have been abusing citizens for a long time before 2020. But this film falls into the common courtroom film trap of obsessing over legal maneuvering and mostly forgetting the real goals of the protagonists. While the protagonists talk a lot about the war and the soldiers sent to fight and die there, the film doesn't actually show any of that war's violence. There isn't a single line of dialogue from a draftee or a vet as far as I can recall. It's one thing to read a list of names of the fallen, but it's quite another to see a 19-year-old bleeding out in a ditch on the far side of the world in the service of a war waged for domestic politics.",

Adapting inIt is important for a film to say what it wants to say correctly and to somehow overcome its claim. \"The Trial of the Chicago 7\" is one of these films. A coherent narrative with a perfectly acceptable script and no extra glamor. Adapting in cinema has always been a difficult task, whether from another literary work or a real event. The film also manages to make this historical adaptation and not only shows the details well, which gives it a new spirit with the art of cinema, so that it has the necessary impact on the audience. An important point is that the film is successful in creating a feeling and does not seek to hide its weaknesses by crowding the film by using unnecessary Techniques or tricks. Throughout the film, we see a variety of emotional atmospheres that are sometimes very lively and sometimes very calm and quiet. The director, however, has been able to create emotion both in crowded spaces and in the silences, that sometimes take the audience to a deeper layer of the movie. The actors in the film are all acceptable, However, some of them do not become characters in the script, and in the meantime, \u201cLangella\u201d acting as the judge and \u201cSacha Baron Cohen\u201d as Abbie was better than others. \u201cSorkin\u201d has once again shown that he has an acceptable ability in screenwriting, and this time he has performed well in directing too. \u201cThe Trial of the Chicago 7\u201d is a compact movie that works to the best of its ability And it tries to get closer to the form, though it cannot be said that it has done it completely, but in some places it gets close to the form. It should be noted that the film is very successful in its purpose and the use of old images and videos helps to convey this purpose to the viewer. What this film has done, that is, create a sense of criticism and sometimes hatred for a corrupt system, is something that not every film can easily do. In general, \u201cThe Trial of the Chicago 7\u201d is a good movie that will be alive for a long time and anyone of any age and period can communicate with it.",

For those too young to know, the first 20 minutes accurately expresses the vitality and energy of late 60s-early 70s Cultural Creatives.  I was there. Sorkin began writing this in 2007.  In 2020, a terrific amount of writerly thought and creativity is on-screen.  No, not the best FABLE for 2020, that's The Island (2005) by Michael Bay and friends.I cried at the final scene of \"7.\"  It brought back all the promise and heartbreak of failures-shortcomings of cultural progressives in the era.

The real facts remind me how inarticulate we were back then.  The movie is more articulate than we were ourselves back then.  Progressive Historian at UCI, Jon Weiner (JonWeiner.com) says the movie is inaccurate yet is truthful.  Thank you, Jon. In the less favorable pro reviews here, I think what is missed is how much thought went into consciously MODULATING the actual personalities to permit greater contrast--and a greater sense of their unity--than was on display in real life.  This is why Abbie Hoffman is downplayed and other character changes.I want to congratulate Frank Langela and Mark Rylance for holding the movie down to the ground.  Frank does wonderful villainy here without over-doing it.  He truthfully portrays the \"out of control\" control-freak which characterized many officals of that era and today.  Mark's integrity and self-confidence balances the just-finding-out-who-I-am of all the the younger characters.

Written and directed by Aaron Sorkin (writer of 'The Social Network' and creator of 'The West Wing'), I've always admired his brilliant, sharp, and witty dialogue, and there's plenty of it to go around here, especially with such a large ensemble cast full of so many great A-listers I can't even begin to list them all out. If I had to single one out, however, I'd say that Sacha Baron Cohen ('Borat') is the MVP of this film, as it allows his signature humor to shine while also giving him a surprising amount of dramatic moments that he pulls off seamlessly. The film does feel standard in terms of a courtroom drama, but there are some moments of humor injected throughout to keep it entertaining enough. And even if the film wraps up with a standard-feeling sappy ending, it's the writing and performances that help keep it entertaining and worthwhile when all's said and done, not to mention many of its themes will feel especially timely to many viewers to keep their interests piqued. Overall, its brilliant writing and roundup of great talent, as well as its timeliness make it a compelling enough watch.",

I don\u2019t mean that in a negative way, I mean that there is some Spielberg influence with an outstanding script. If you didn\u2019t know, Steven Spielberg was originally supposed to direct this film but dropped out and Writer/Director Aaron Sorkin took over. The writing and directing here are excellent. Sorkin knows how to keep your attention with simple scenes by having long monologues with unique camerawork and interesting framing. The performances here are great too especially Sacha Baren Cohen and Eddie Redmayne. I would say this is probably a career best for Redmayne and one of my favorite Cohen performances but his performance in Borat still has this film beat. The story is engaging and interesting which is weird because a lot of this is court room drama but I was invested for 95% of the time. The riot scenes are sprinkled throughout the film and those scenes are excellent. My issue with the film is its historical accuracy and certain dramatic moments.

I knew next to nothing about the Chicago 7 beforeThe Trial of the Chicago 7 resonates as much as it does because even though it is a dramatization of events from 50 years ago, it feels like it could have been based on current events. I knew next to nothing about the Chicago 7 before watching this movie, but I also know that good movies don\u2019t always make for good history. However, The Trial of the Chicago 7 does the best thing a movie based on an important true story can do: it gives me a strong sense of what things were like for the people involved and it makes me want to learn more. I have never cared much for Aaron Sorkin\u2019s TV projects, but I have really enjoyed his film writing (A Few Good Men, The Social Network) and even his work as a director (Molly\u2019s Game). As with Molly\u2019s Game, Sorkin writes and directs, but it is clear that Sorkin the writer is at the helm. Aaron Sorkin is aware that his forte is writing speeches and debates and that awareness can also be his problem. This based-on-true-events courtroom drama is in many ways what you expect, but it is no less satisfying to watch.Protests against the Vietnam War at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago turned into riots and 7 people (actually 8) were arrested and charged with crossing state lines to intentionally start a riot, though, of course, this was not true. We see dramatizations of the trial, strategy sessions and arguments the 7 have with each other and their lawyer, and flashbacks of the events leading up to the protests turned riots and why that turn happened (it might be unfortunately no surprise or shock to find out that the police, not the accused 7, escalated the protests into riots).  This is the epitome of an ensemble cast. Every role, major and minor, is a distinct one and played by recognizable name or face. It is an impressive and slightly distracting cast. When the defense team tracks down an important witness you spend the preceding scene wondering what celebrity will be waiting for them at the end of the hall. The standouts of the ensemble are Sacha Baron Cohen, who has earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance in the very showy role of Abbie Hoffman, Mark Rylance as William Kunstler, the determined lawyer for the 7, and Frank Langella as the prejudiced, frustrating, and incompetent Judge Julius Hoffman. Eddie Redmayne gives a good performance as Tom Hayden, the head of Students for a Democratic Society, but his best scenes are his arguments/debates with Cohen as Abbie Hoffman. I really enjoyed their scenes together; both are on the same side and want to achieve the same goal but are on different paths. The 8th person on trial is Bobby Seale, the national chairman of the Black Panthers, played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. who was not involved in the planning of any of the DNC protests but was charged nevertheless and lumped into the trial as part of the FBI\u2019s campaign against the Panthers. The scenes with Seale are noteworthy not just for the injustice being dealt to him but for Mateen\u2019s performance as well. Joseph Gordon Levitt plays the federal prosecutor and does a good job in a pretty restrained role. John Carol Lynch and others also turn in solid performances but in a cast this stacked it is difficult to stand out. The story of the Chicago 7 is perfect material for Sorkin. It allows for lengthy speeches, wordy arguments, memorable characters, and declarations about political and moral values. The runtime is just over two hours but for a dialogue heavy movie, it is well paced and engaging. I think Sorkin successfully makes this into something more than just another courtroom drama. The Trial of the Chicago 7 feels like a pageant at times but it is one that needs to be performed and is done so very well. This film doesn\u2019t have the at times frenetic feel of Molly\u2019s Game\u2014which really feels like he was trying to recreate Danny Boyle\u2019s lively aesthetic\u2014or an especially distinct visual style. Here Sorkin lets the dialogue and performances shape the movie.",

Although set amongst the political unrest in the 1960s, the film seeks to echo today's political climate with a fraught election impending, a partisan electorate, a pandemic, and daily protests - a political drama like this hits just right. Aaron Sorkin wrote and directed this courtroom drama that's destined to be in the conversation for major awards attention. Is such awards attention warranted? Here's how I see it.The Trial of the Chicago 7 is about a trial of 7 activists who were charged with inciting a riot outside of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968. The defendants on trial include Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and David Dellinger. In an unfortunate turn of events, Bobby Seale ends up on trial with the \"7\" even though he had nothing to do with the protests and was only in Chicago for 4 hours on the day of the riot. The trial also features the tireless work of the lawyer for the \"7\", William Kuntsler and the ultimate antagonist, Judge Julius Hoffman. This cast of characters is packed with actors giving it their all, including: Sacha Baron Cohen, Eddie Redmayne, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jeremy Strong, Mark Rylance, and Frank Langella, among others.As courtroom dramas go, The Trial of the Chicago 7 has all of the ingredients to be great, if only based on its screenplay. Aaron Sorkin is an accomplished writer, who won an Academy Award for The Social Network, and he wrote one of the best courtroom monologues of all time from A Few Good Men. If you are not familiar with the history that this story is based on, then there is a lot of foundation to be laid in order to understand where it's going. Sorkin does a good job in both the screenplay and direction in showing who the characters are, what their motivations may be and setting a tone for the film. The editing of all that is going on between the protests, the interactions of the characters and the procedures of the trial makes it all come together.As far as the ensemble, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II plays Bobby Seale and he gives such a great performance. He is dynamic and emotional. Whenever he's on screen, the focus can't help but be on him. Unfortunately, he isn't on screen enough and disappears entirely at one point. Also, Mark Rylance is very powerful as William Kuntsler. He gets some of the best lines in the film and becomes a champion for the cause. I can definitely see Rylance and Abdul-Mateen as acting nominees for this. There also a fairly awesome cameo near the end.The Trial of the Chicago 7 is worthy of a big box of popcorn. It is an easy watch that breezes by and is very entertaining. There is a powerful message that resonates in today's climate",

It seems they were going for an end to match 'A Few Good Men', which was also written by Aaron Sorkin of course. From the overly uplifting score, to the slow clap, to the freeze-frame. Per Esquire, the scene is not even how it went down IRL either. I'm all for 'Hollywood endings', just less of the cheese please.The rest of 'The Trial of the Chicago 7' is, though, very good. Sacha Baron Cohen (Abbie) is the greatest performer, the role is mostly comedic - which he nails - but even in the more serious moments he is terrific. Jeremy Strong (Jerry) is notable alongside him, also. Eddie Redmayne, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Frank Langella, Mark Rylance and Joseph Gordon-Levitt merit props, too.I did enjoy how it portrays the (true) story, one that is very interesting no doubt. Overall, I had a pleasant time watching this - though I'd rate it a tad higher if not for that (not negative, just a bit lame) ending.",

Even on my second watch, it's as energetic and riveting as earlier. Aaron Sorkin's ability to create a setting in a simple courtroom but still keep tings fascinating and entertaining is remarkable. This is a more screenplay than direction movie, but the direction is still top-class and makes the movie much more than an Oscar-bait biopic. The whole cast is amazing, with Frank Langella, Sacha Baron Cohen and Eddie Redmayne be the standout performers, and the other members of the cast are also very good. This film has great editing which manages to keep it fascinating and intriguing. While I don't think it's really that emotionally appealing or take sThe Social Network level risks, it's still amazing in it's own way. The Trial Of The Chicago 7 is riveting, exciting, entertaining, and is filled with great performances, screenplay and really good editing.",
