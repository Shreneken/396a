  "critic_reviews": [
    "A dreamy homage to old-school Hollywood as well as a haunting, female-driven psychological thriller with deep mystery and satisfying twists",
    "Rebecca has a couple of slow stretches, but James is always interesting and always sympathetic, if only because we see her struggling to do her best. After all, it’s much easier to not give up on a character when we see she hasn’t given up on herself. The movie further benefits from the absence of 1940s-style censorship, which suppressed a key plot detail that’s restored here.",
    "It’s what James and Thomas bring to the table that makes this new adaptation of Rebecca worth watching.",
    "Wheatley’s Rebecca is still a strong film when judged on its own. It looks gorgeous, has solid performances, and excels at amplifying the predatory central dynamic between “I” and Danvers in a singular way that earns a place besides Hitchcock’s.",
    "With or without that hallowed history, it's hard not to feel the lack of something in director Ben Wheatley's lush, ponderous update — the most obvious thing, perhaps, being Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine.",
    "There’s nothing in this version of Rebecca to cause it to stand out from its crowded field of predecessors but, due to the strength of the novel (to which it is reasonably faithful), it holds the viewer’s interest and will likely maintain an aura of suspense and mystery for those unfamiliar with the story.",
    "Pint-sized James — you never realize how short her other leading men were until you see her paired with Hammer — carries this Rebecca, and I think carries it off, even as it’s taking us places no “Rebecca” has ever gone before. It’s not a classic and not “Hitchcock,” but hell, thanks to James, Hammer, Thomas and Dowd, it’ll do.",
    "Personally, I would have preferred a little more Wheatley edge, a little less Country Living.",
    "Handsome, risk-taking Netflix remake sacrifices suspense for sweeping sadness.",
    "This is Ben Wheatley on a different register: a bigger scale, a more mainstream approach. There’s much to like — but the shadow of Alfred Hitchcock looms large.",
    "For about three-quarters of the running time, Rebecca does a respectable job of navigating between respect for the source and establishing its own distinct identity. And then, at precisely the moment where it stands to make a few enlightened improvements . . . this Rolls-Royce of an adaptation veers off the road.",
    "The film only gets as far as the beach, and James’ breathy line readings, and Scott Thomas’ icy supporting performance. It never bothers undressing.",
    "Rebecca is a psychologically rich story with so much to pick at and probe. That means decisions need to be made on where to focus, and Wheatley bats about .500 in that respect.",
    "Wheatley plays it safe, and throws star power and sumptuous imagery our way as reason enough for his pale, uninventive iteration of the classic gothic horror. It goes down easy enough thanks to Lily James and the already-delicious plot, but Wheatley’s imitation fumbles when it matters most.",
    "Despite its title, this Rebecca is decidedly modeled after the second Mrs. de Winter instead of the first. Soapy where Hitchcock’s interpretation was stiff, the film is beautiful and hurried and eager to be liked by everyone in a way that will only lead to trouble. It dutifully respects Manderley’s past, while at the same time revitalizing that drafty mausoleum with an Instagram-ready sheen.",
    "While the new Rebecca is a lot of things, irresistible, alas, isn't one of them.",
    "This new Rebecca has its own sense of style, and it’s not above fully embracing the pulpy delights of du Maurier’s book, but unlike the unnamed second Mrs. de Winter, it can’t quite break free of the inevitable expectations placed upon it.",
    "Wheatley gives us one grotesque dream sequence of guests at a masquerade ball, but the rest is palely conventional. Like the character who gives the film its title, the adaptation is pretty much dead in the water.",
    "Scott Thomas sounds like she’s about to pull out a shiv and knife her new boss right then and there. The actress is so good, you wish she could reprise the role in a better film that actually deserves her.",
    "Everyone behaves themselves in this Rebecca, whereas the point of the book and the first movie is that our worst behavior is always floating just below the waterline, ready to bob to the surface at the wrong moment.",
    "We can’t travel these days, so it’s fun to wallow in the scenery and its vivid colors. Want a great movie? Go watch the original Rebecca instead, but you probably knew that already.",
    "This journey from sun-soaked beaches to chilly English country, from heart-racing flirtation to soul-shattering stress, from new love to old regrets, feels dry and flaccid. Much like Mrs. de Winter, the long shadow of Hitchcock's Rebecca proves just too powerful to ignore.",
    "For some reason that shall forever remain a mystery to all those but director Ben Wheatley and the almighty Netflix algorithm, 2020 has delivered one of the most unnecessary remakes in the history of an industry built upon revisitation: Rebecca.",
    "Earlier films like Sightseers and Free Fire suggested Ben Wheatley might have the mordant wit to tackle a work forever associated with sardonic genre maestro Alfred Hitchcock. But in place of atmosphere and suspense, he delivers blandly glossy melodrama.",
    "The film is a pretty bauble of a thing that ticks off the story’s shock revelations in an efficient, if not particularly surprising, fashion.",
    "Manderley is in part a state of mind. In this Rebecca, that state is exasperating boredom.",
    "This new Rebecca feels as if someone at Downton Abbey were having a bad day.",
    "Instead of growing from a sweet young thing into a strong woman who is Maxim’s equal, this bride stays scared and vulnerable until close to the end, when the script turns her implausibly into a sort of Nancy Drew doing detective work for the husband she adores. Who could have guessed that the film with a modern perspective on gender politics was the one made 80 years ago?",
    "Wheatley — who specializes in thrillers with a macabre vibe, like \"Kill List\" (2011) and \"High-Rise\" (2015) — overhandles and overworks the dough of Du Maurier’s basic story. His movie is sometimes dumb, sometimes dull and sometimes entertaining; it just doesn’t know what it wants to be, and that lack of vision drains its potential power.",
    "Glossy, handsomely mounted, with ample footage of mist-swathed Cornish cliffs, this adaptation is all still waters and no depth.",
    "The filmmakers seem curiously at sea over the purpose of their assignment, possessing neither the patience to plunge headlong into the story’s familiar depths nor the radicalism to reinvent it entirely.",
    "Rebecca 2.0 is sometimes quite enjoyable in all its silliness and campiness and brassiness, and in some ways, gets closer to the narrative shape of the original novel than the Hitchcock film, which rather truncated the third act.",
    "A work of fierce interiority has been turned into a hollow exercise in exteriority.",
    "Lily James brings a refreshing straightforwardness to the role in the second half, as the character takes the reins of the situation, but has a difficult time convincing us in the first half that she is susceptible, cowed, in thrall.",
    "The pretty, empty, emotionally frictionless and touch-free new Rebecca adaptation may suit the pandemic dictates for social distancing, but the drama fails to spark.",
    "Rebecca is nice to look at, inoffensive, competently executed and utterly unnecessary when once, it was so much more.",
    "This Rebecca can’t really suffer in comparison to its predecessor. To suffer it would need nerves, a pulse, a conscience, or at least some idea of its reason for being.",
    "The leads set the tone for this unfortunate waste of time, heralding a series of issues that reflect poorly not only on this ugly retread but on much of Hollywood’s recent output as a whole."

A wonderful adaptation with perfectly cast archetypes of womens power, the men paled by comparison which was a welcome contrast between 1940 and 2020 direction as well as a spotlight on how well Du Maurier channeled timeless female strengths 80 years ago!For me the garish yellow suits the alfa males cowardice; fear of living alone, of betrayal and of losing face. This actor was very close to the Maxim in my mind conjured from re-reading the book a 1000 times; handsome, commanding, hotheaded yet weak in character... a shell. We are not meant to fall in love with Maxim,  he is an object of pity; a male in distress. It is the simpering, unnamed heroine who defeats her dragon, embraces her dead rival, rescues her man and lives on... The book strikes a chord with women and this film highlights and celebrates its girl power where Hitchcock tactfully placed artful, broody shadows, perhaps to keep the book within his social lens and time. Nothing can touch a Hitchcock masterpiece however this film, in many ways is more honest towards Du Mauriers cunning flip of stereotypes.The locations, cinematography and costumes are superb.I think the critics are comparing the film to Hitchcock's vision not Du Maurier's book and for that very reason have missed the magic.",

Meanwhile, the memory of his first wife pervades the property and haunts his memory, which isn’t helped by the sinister housekeeper (Kristin Scott Thomas in the movie’s most juicy role). First off, the scenery and rich locations are beautifully showcased (only 2 rooms were sets). Secondly, the other performances are adequate, while never especially compelling. Finally, the story’s twists are the most interesting part of the film. I’ve never seen the Hitchcock original, so no comparisons, but l’d imagine this version is certainly more romantic and lush than suspenseful. Still entertaining.",

That's especially true when a director attempts to follow in the footsteps of a legendary director. It's advice that would have been well heeded with regard to this remake of the 1940 Alfred Hitchcock classic \"Rebecca.\" When a naive lady's traveling companion is swept off her feet by a wealthy English aristocrat in Monte Carlo, she's soon overwhelmed by her new life when she joins him back at home as his new wife, becoming the lady of the house at his sprawling seaside estate, a mansion where the ghost of his deceased first wife allegedly still lives on -- and with whom he is apparently still obsessed. While the film features a superb BAFTA-nominated production design, gorgeous cinematography, and excellent performances by Lily James, Kristen Scott Thomas and Ann Dowd, the suspense factor that made this picture's predecessor a classic is virtually nonexistent here. Instead, this offering tediously rumbles along, tossing out occasional mildly interesting revelations but never reaching out and grabbing viewers in the way that a Hitchcockian-type tale should. The story even becomes somewhat at muddled as it moves toward its conclusion, diluting the impact of whatever modest chills it may have built up along the way. Indeed, this release is, once again, further proof that, when it comes to emulating cinematic icons, it's generally best to leave well enough alone.",

The film is based on a novel by Daphne du Maurier that has been on high schoolThis week Netflix released a remake of an Alfred Hitchcock classic, Rebecca, that stars Lily James and Armie Hammer as the main couple at the center of the story. The film is based on a novel by Daphne du Maurier that has been on high school reading lists for decades though I've never read it or seen the Hitchcock version. I didn't know exactly what I was getting into, but I expected thrills, maybe a ghost and a tense mystery. Here's what I actually got.The basic premise of Rebecca is that a rich guy, Maxim de Winter (Hammer), falls for a young lady's companion (James) while on vacation and their swooning romance becomes an impulsive commitment. Maxim is a widower still troubled by his wife, Rebecca's death; but, he brings the new Mrs. de Winter to his estate, Maderley, where the specter of Rebecca lingers and clings to the shady housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Thomas). Hijinks ensue.Supposedly, there's a mystery surrounding the circumstances of Rebecca's death. We hear whispers, but get no real details. Mrs. Danvers acts very strangely and disapproving of the new Mrs. de Winter, but the sneering portrayal while good doesn't really enhance the material. Both Lily James and Kristin Scott Thomas fill their roles admirably. James plays the doe-eyed rube well. She reminds me of the charm she had from her days in Downton Abbey. Thomas gets to be icy and almost menacing. Her obsession with Rebecca is palpable, but it is not really clear why she is so stuck on her - it feels just like a power trip. Hammer just fills the role of window dressing - any actor could have played that part. He and Lily James do look good together and have some good moments, but she gets the credit for selling the romance aspect of this film.The look of Rebecca is really well done though. Manderley is a stunning estate inside and out. It has that English stateliness of a Downton Abbey, but it also is creepy - too big to be cozy and so many rooms. There are shots that are on cliffs that are beautiful and scary at once. The sprawl of all that is going on fills the screen so wonderfully. They really spent their money well on that aspect. If the plot were as interesting as the craft of the film, then this would be a real winner.Ultimately, Rebecca is a passable film for 2 hours. It is not entirely engrossing, but it isn't boring either. It takes a while to get to the point and for the mystery to develop, but even then, it feels like an afterthought. On a gloomy autumn evening, you could do worse with a handful of popcorn than watch Rebecca. Give it a try.",
