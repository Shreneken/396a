  "critic_reviews": [
    "Moss continues to deliver what we crave from woman characters: the kind of messy yet sturdy intricacy many of today’s thinly conceived you-go-girl female superheroes continue to lack.",
    "There’s no extraneous storytelling here, no scene that feels unnecessary, no scary moment that plays like it’s pandering. This is the expertly told, horrifying story of an abusive relationship filtered through the lens of a classic horror movie monster.",
    "The horror of The Invisible Man comes from the knowledge that not only would Griffin’s schemes work should such a technology exist, but also from knowing that they already do.",
    "It’s elegant and diabolically poised, a familiar story expertly retooled for an era of tech-bro sociopathy and #MeToo outrage, but also graced with an insistently human pulse. Studio brand extensions rarely feel this intimate, this personally unnerving.",
    "Moss shifts into another gear for the truly disturbing finale, when those eyes flicker with thoughts of revenge and events unfold in a way that remind us that Whannell’s big break was as the screenwriter of Saw. The Invisible Man ends on a nasty note, but then again the 1933 film was nasty too. Given the omnipotent power of invisibility, humans apparently do their worst.",
    "Elisabeth Moss delivers the best performance of her film career, carrying the story every step of the way.",
    "Moss gives yet another fearless performance – hers is a raw, exposed, physical, and ultimately fierce role, and it’s often stunning to watch the manic energy in her eyes as she attacks a scene.",
    "Movies that make you think are great, but most of our finest filmmakers attempt that (even sometimes when they shouldn’t). With Leigh Whannell, we have a hyper-competent craftsman who seems like he’d rather make us shit our pants. It’s nice.",
    "The Invisible Man is full of tension and surprise, a brooding midnight movie traumatizer packed with the constant threat of unhinged energy that roars with a crowd.",
    "While not particularly subtle or probing, The Invisible Man manages to do what many of our greatest horror movies have done before it: address a real-life, everyday nightmare in a heightened, bracing, and even cathartic way.",
    "Moss also strengthens the notion that this is a monster movie unusually interested in looking past the toxic-male machinations of its famous character and toward the lasting horrors left in his wake. In other words, the stuff that previous movies, and real life, have sometimes tried to turn invisible.",
    "Subverting the original text’s point of view allows Whannell to privilege his female protagonist while continuing to explore the novel’s theme of untrammelled power.",
    "The script is solid, the cast is excellent, most of the special effects are impressive too.",
    "The scariness quotient remains high to the end, the plot is sufficiently twisty, and it’s stirring to watch Cecilia prevail against monstrosity without becoming a monster herself. As to how it all works out, let’s just say that the right person gets the last slash.",
    "By situating the film in the context of domestic abuse, Whannel avoids cliché by evoking the way that distressed women are routinely treated as irrational and disreputable – a theme carried through to the film’s inspired conclusion.",
    "It’s an inspired and nasty movie about domestic abuse and its aftermath that is also perverse fun, a dynamic sure to raise some eyebrows — but for our purposes here, just know that it’s far from kid stuff.",
    "It’s powered by a truly harrowing performance from Moss, and with the exception of one plot thread it probably telegraphs a little too obviously, is cleverly constructed for maximum dread — and maximum audience identification with Cecilia and her precarious grip on sanity.",
    "Moss’s full-bore performance — anchored by her extraordinarily supple face — gives the movie its emotional stakes.",
    "Working from his own tight script, Whannell demonstrates an admirable ability to place the wet-yourself shocks where you least expect them. Benjamin Wallfisch’s insidious score complements later action, but the director is prepared to play out the opening conflicts with no music whatsoever. Great thought has gone into the architecture of this ingenious structure",
    "The Invisible Man is a chilling mind-bender that strikes at our deepest fears — the ones we can’t see.",
    "With Moss’ brilliance in full view, Whannell’s taut exercise in suspense gives Universal’s monsters a jolt of life.",
    "Unbearably tense and thematically rich, this feels like an entirely fresh take on a 123-year-old story.",
    "Leigh Whannell’s film – one of the smartest and scariest yet to roll off the production line at horror specialists Blumhouse.",
    "This gratifyingly clever and, at times, powerfully staged thriller is too rooted in our era to be called old-fashioned — its release, in fact, feels almost karmically synched to the week of the Harvey Weinstein verdict. Yet there’s one way that the movie is old-fashioned: It does an admirable job of taking us back to a time when a horror film could actually mean something.",
    "Leigh Whannell's bleak and brutal reimagining of the classic Invisible Man is chillingly effective.",
    "It’s all pretty marvelous stuff, as much a well-oiled genre machine as it is a respite from big studio bloat, a flick more decidedly horror than any version before and yet another showcase for Elisabeth Moss’s herculean prowess.",
    "When Whannell’s movie is at its best, the audience is not just a witness to the terror; we are part of the machinery that inflicts it. Which is not to say that — when it works — this remake of James Whale’s 1933 classic is a success born of camera placement, special effects, or even conceptual daring.",
    "The latest film version loosely adapting the Wells story exploits it both ways, subtly and crassly. It works, thanks largely to a riveting and fearsomely committed Elisabeth Moss mining writer-director Leigh Whannell’s stalker scenario for all sorts of psychological nuance.",
    "The fun is watching the shivery details — such as a shot of the back of Cecilia’s neck, in which we can almost feel the sudden scent of a presence — and appreciating the skill of Moss’ performance.",
    "Elisabeth Moss is an acting event all by herself, a modern version of Bette Davis, and The Invisible Man gives her a chance to embody all kinds of emotional extremes — terror, dread, madness, inconsolable grief and murderous rage.",
    "It’s a sly, twisty little chiller, not ashamed of its B-movie bona fides and better for it.",
    "If the buildup and catharsis of its final minutes are more than a little silly, and marred by Whannell’s urge to put too neat bow on it all, the movie still has its satisfying jolts — including possibly one of the single most shocking screen deaths so far this year.",
    "With a lot of silence, some wonderful, minimalist effects doled out for maximum shock value, and a focused, fear-filled turn by Moss, Whannell has updated a timeless title with a genuinely horrific message.",
    "The Invisible Man is both a jumpstart and a template for their renaissance: The movie delves into the sheer terror of abuse and explores how Cecilia doesn’t even really understand the psychological scars until she begins to discover some semblance of freedom.",
    "For all the authentic thrills that the film eventually delivers, it leaves the feeling of a terrific idea that’s been left on the drawing board.",
    "Moss is good at these roles, so good that she should probably take a break from them. But The Invisible Man is still an excellent vehicle for her; you can’t imagine the film without her.",
    "Though Whannell started out as a writer, it’s clear that stylish direction is where his strengths truly lie. Luckily, The Invisible Man has more than enough of that to hold the viewer’s attention.",
    "Moss, whose gift for speaking volumes with purposeful stares is well-documented on \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" perfectly captures the sense of invasion Cecelia feels, and at first, helplessness. Her growing strength, in the face of such an overwhelming threat, is the movie's most empowering element.",
    "Leigh Whannell does a damn fine job manifesting unnerved tension and sustaining Cecilia’s downfall right in front of everyone’s eyes.",
    "The Invisible Man is a thrilling movie. If nothing else, it will make you question if that feeling you get of being watched is just in your head, or if there really is somebody else in the room.",
    "Thanks in large part to Moss's performance, The Invisible Man becomes a fascinating dive into a survivor's psyche wrapped up in a compelling and truly scary horror movie.",
    "Leigh Whannell’s version of The Invisible Man is a smart take on a story that seems next to impossible to tell in an interesting way, but here it somehow is.",
    "By the time the film begins approaching the two-hour point, the feeling sets in that perhaps Whannell is stretching his conceit a bit too far for its own good. But it’s hard to deny his ingenuity and flair with genre tropes and keeping his audience somewhere approaching the edge of its collective seat.",
    "There may be two genres at work in The Invisible Man, but there’s only one Elisabeth Moss, and her performance makes Whannell’s film worth discussing far beyond the realm of the title character.",
    "The Invisible Man loses its personality as it tumbles into the third act, and with it goes a lot of the emotional fiber Moss has worked so hard to spin into something rich and memorable. She still holds her own as the movie crumbles around her, but her performance deserves better than what Whannell ultimately gives her.",
    "Whannell has the talent and cunning to turn The Invisible Man into a chilling and well-crafted B-movie. But if you’re looking for anything more than that, you’ll probably come up empty.",
    "Whannell fails to address how easily the power of invisibility can be foiled in today’s world where anyone can buy cheap (less than $200) infrared goggles for overnight delivery.",
    "The Invisible Man is not as smart as it could have been, but the concept is ingenious even if the execution gets slapdash. And with Moss at the center, it doesn’t matter all that much — she sells what’s approached as B-movie material with the unwavering dedication of someone starring in a prestige biopic.",
    "Whannell is so invested in unloading juicy surprises that this initially realistic story becomes increasingly preposterous, but Moss keeps the film anchored in plausibility; although sometimes just barely.",
    "There’s fun to be had here, thanks to Moss and an involving set-up, and given the state of multiplex horror, especially at this time of year, this is a striking diversion. But Whannell gives us just enough to make us want more and despite the stretched 125-minute runtime, he can’t quite deliver what he loosely promises.",
    "The Invisible Man is inarguably well done, and this is one of Elisabeth Moss’s best performances, but this is the kind of subject matter you can’t short-shrift. This is life-altering, traumatizing stuff, but in privileging horror shocks over emotional reality, this film unmasks itself. It’s not as interested in abuse victims as it is cheap thrills.",
    "As the film progresses and positions itself closer and closer to visualizing what Adrian might look like, it also becomes more cartoonish. Adrian comes to be rendered almost as if he were a comic-book villain, which severely undermines the weight of the story.",
    "The idea of combining creature-feature invisibility with domestic-abuse gaslighting — playing with someone’s reality to make them think they’re going insane — is inspired. This middling horror film, regrettably, is not.",
    "It’s an original and timely feminist spin on HG Wells’s concept, and a welcome riposte to those thrillers that are fascinated by homicidal maniacs at the expense of their victims. If only the film itself had been clever or scary enough to do justice to its ingenious premise.",
    "Through to the end, you can’t get off on the thrill of this film’s craftsmanship without also getting off on the spectacle of more than just Cecilia brought to the brink of destruction. Like its style, The Invisible Man’s cruelty is the point.",
    "It’s just a giant missed opportunity to be something more.",
    "\"Saw\" writer Leigh Whannell mixes metaphors in this limp remake, using gaslighting and privacy fears for his uneven sci-fi horror."

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nWhannell's directing experience with The Invisible Man provides a riveting horror plot that still leaves questions towards some of the decision-making that transpires throughout the movie. Overall, there are areas I really enjoy but also dislike. It is hard to grade this one, not going to lie. I just find myself viewing this movie as \"mediocre\" with potential to be something greater.First off, the plot was great. I really enjoyed the thriller/horror experience with such a foggy perspective of Cecilia's mind from the start. You know something is wrong with her mentally, but it keeps getting worse or clearer as the movie continues. I thought the ending was bland, but understood the mindset behind it. With the amount of intensity that the entire movie provided, I just believe it could have offered more for the ending scene (although, the death scene was insane... in a good way).Cast was fantastic, I really believed everyone did their job well with their respected roles. One issue I did have with the cast was Moss's character as Cecilia. There were some cases where I just believed it was hard to watch her act. The dinner scene with her sister was crazy, but I think her state was too altered to switch from normal to insane every 5 seconds. Do not find it realistic as well. There were times her acting also reminded me of Jordan Peele's \"Us\" movie once her cloned killed her. It was that kind of insanity I did not want to see, but it seemed to show up in some cases which was not what was intended for her character in my opinion.I was split on some of the special effects. Although I understand the complications that come from fighting something invisible, it sometimes just turned funny rather than scary watching them fight the invisible man. Overall, it was not bad, but not super good.One main problem I have with this movie is the amount of things that do not make sense. From the beginning there were many scenes that just provided no significance or common sense to the overall film and it definitely is the main reason why I gave this a 6.5/10. Cecilia cutting her wrist and surviving without bleeding out after a 15+ minute scene. The Invisible Man seemingly surviving almost every blunt force that comes at him expect the bullets at the end. The Invisible Man was essentially a superhero with that costume, almost killing everyone with a single hit. Also, what is the significance to the cameras on the costume? What is the significance of the money if he was going to take it away anyways? Why did they never check security footage at the dinner with her sister? Is the Invisible Man omnipresent (he gets places sooooooo fast)? There are many questions that ultimately leave me baffled with this movie. They could have provided more realism to it and it did not seem to offer that when I saw it.I would recommend seeing it. I believe it is a \"love it or ya hate it\" kind of film. Won't see it again though.",

Bogged down with cliches and doesn’t fully transcend its genre as it appeared eager to do at first.  I was entertained moment to moment but baffled by the film’s logic.  It fails to pass the test of: why don’t they just use cell phones and videos to solve these problems.  Which gives the script a “written in the 90’s vibe” which is kind of how the movie feels (at its best) but it’s extremely  modern in other ways, having major plot turns rely on email, uber and the suit’s futuristic technology.  So where is the cell phone video?  We’re talking about a story about a woman entirely out to prove that she’s being stalked by an invisible intruder and she doesn’t think to herself “I can film this to prove it.”  If you can look past that sort of stuff, it’s a fine movie.  If you can’t, it’ll feel more like a decent movie.  Definitely not a bad movie though.",

While a had aI was genuinely surprised that a horror movie like this early in 2020 didn’t suck. Most studios just throw out really bad horror movies in January and February just to get rid of them. The Invisible Man is the rare exception. While a had a lot of issues with the film, it still was a very solid effort and did the one thing a horror movie should do, be scary. The film’s biggest trait is that it does not rely on cheap jumpscares. It instead relies on a natural build up of tension that pays off with an interesting and unique scare. The film also doesn’t continuously use the same type of scare. Some horror movies will continuously use the scary face trope to get a reaction but The Invisible Man doesn’t. Each scare is unique in its own way. I won’t spoil any of them because they are quite creepy and need to be seen and not explained. Elisabeth Moss does a great job in this film. She is able to communicate this sense of loneliness while being surrounded by everyone and was able to convey the emotions of fear, sadness, and joy in a natural yet intentionally creepy way. The rest of the cast does a fine job but really don’t compare to Moss. The only thing holding her performance from being top notch is the screenplay. Some of the lines of dialogue were very awkward and took away from some scenes because of how corny or lame they were. That didn’t happen throughout the whole movie but when it did, it was noticeable. The rest of the film’s technical aspects were pretty good. The direction from Leigh Whannell was unique and interesting and the cinematography was pretty great. Each shot was visually interesting and had something to offer. The way they shot some of the scenes was great. Exchanges were shot from many different points of view and the camera was able to spin around and follow characters exact movements during action sequences. One technical aspect I took issue with was the score. While the actual composition of the music was good, the repetitiveness of it was a little irritating. The film kept using the same song for more intense scenes and it got distracting after a while. It didn’t delve into different ways to use music for scenes with high amounts of tension and I really wish it had done that. The film also has a lot of plot inconsistencies and dumb character decisions. One such inconsistency that isn’t spoiler related is when a car crashes. The front of the car is really banged up but it’s shown less than a minute later and it’s completely fixed. Overall, The Invisible Man is a mostly smart horror movie with a great lead performance, story, direction, and cinematography but is almost undermined by a weak screenplay, plot inconsistencies, and dumb character decisions.",

This movie has some structural plot holes that just cannot go unnoticed for example why didn't the cop did something about Adrian \"faking\" his death, even after he was supposedly kidnapped). Why didn't Cecilia told her sister and to her cop friend about Adrian's cellphone that she found on her **** attick weeks after Adrian was dead? The trailers tell another story, I thought it was going to be a thriller about a damaged person from all those years of abuse. Maybe she had schizophrenia, maybe it was all inside her head but NOPE, man bad wears an invisible cape suit. At this point, I lost all interest. The acting is SOLID especially on Moss part and the soundtrack thank god isn't used just to \"enhance\" the jumpscares. I really liked parts of this movie but really hated some and I don't know, you should watch it and see it for yourself.",

Universal finally made a GOOD remake of one of their classic monster movies!! (Celebration by Kool and the Gang plays) Not only is it a good remake, I’d say it’s the best Universal Monster movie since Creature from the Black Lagoon! This remake is very different from the original 1933 film as well as the HG Wells novella it was loosely based on so purists may still be unhappy with this movie, but I’m all for updates to the classics (that’s pretty much what the original films were, they’re almost nothing like the original books) so it didn’t bother me at all. The Invisible Man updates the story in very clever ways that I won’t spoil here and it gives a sci-fi horror twist to a relevant story about an abusive relationship. Nobody sees it happening and nobody believes the main character when she tells people about it. Huh. The lead performance from Elisabeth Moss (yes, I’m spelling her name correctly this time) is fantastic, and this movie is SCARY! The original 1933 film was very effects-heavy with a lot of comedy. In this, there is no comedy to be found and the effects are very minimal, but even if the movie is showing you nothing it makes you feel the presence of an evil figure lurking around using only framing, sound design and Elisabeth Moss’ performance. There are tons of tense and creative sequences (very similar to the director’s last film, Upgrade) and a ton of suspense. You never know when the titular character is going to show up next and it keeps you on the edge of your seat! I think the movie was a little too fast-paced, the buildup to what’s really going on could’ve been slower and more effective, and the score can be loud and overbearing at times, but overall I thought this movie was excellent. This is a must-see for any horror fan or fan of the classics! I’m so happy this movie is a hit and we’ll be getting more movies like it! I can’t wait, this is going to be awesome. The Universal Monsters are back and I couldn’t be more happy. The director of this wants to do a remake of Dracula and James Wan is producing a Frankenstein remake, among a ton of other projects in development. Yes. All the yes. Give them to me. I want them.",

He's been declared dead, but she finds herself menaced by this unseen force. This was a decent film.Though there is violence, this is one of those films that relies on more on suspense, and it's done really, really well. Rather than kill Cecilia, the invisible man is trying to ruin her life. He's subtle at first and there is a lot of tension wondering if he's in the room or not and what he's going to do next. And when stuff happens, it can be pretty startling at times.The movie looks great. Director Leigh Whannell (Upgrade, Insidious 3) continuous his style: a starkly lit look. There are a lot of nice wide shots and pans to give the impression that Cecilia is being watched. (However, I thought that the opening scene was a little too darkly lit.)Moss, whose character is the biggest part of the film, does an excellent job portraying a woman going through trauma but is also wily when threatened.This isn't a perfect movie, though. Running at two hours and four minutes this didn't have to be that long. There are too many scenes of Cecilia being freaked out or people not believing her. The antagonist's plan didn't have to be that complicated. (Though it does mostly make sense in the long run. I've seen other movies with this level of intricacy that couldn't pull it off.) Also, there are several lines of dialogue and decisions that don't feel natural.Overall, I don't think you need to see this immediately, but if you like suspense then this if for you.",

This film much like upgrade thrives with a crisp smart script and fantastic visuals. Whannell has a keen eye for detail and it shows in bunches in this film.

There are many moments in this vicious film that you will not see coming and I was actually surprised by the amount of brutality which serves the overall story well.

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nTo be completely honest, after watching this movie, I am shocked to see a 7.1 from both the audience and critics, that rarely lines up, and usually, both aren't so horrendously wrong. I went in with low expectations from Blumhouse, after their last few movies they have felt like a shadow of who they used to be and this movie reflects that, loudly. The Invisible Man is one of the worst movies I have seen this year and I am an avid moviegoer who goes typically 3-5 times a month. Not only does it have multiple moments where it appears to be ending (sort of like the false endings in LoTR), but it just continuously drags on with so very little going on at damn near every point of the f***ing movie. I'd say the beginning of the movie was the most interesting part, but they never build or show their relationship, we have no way of knowing just how terrible Adrian really was to her. It seemed odd that they refused to show the abusive relationship, I mean, the movie is over 2 hours long, and there's next to nothing about their relationship. I think the movie possibly could have benefitted from showing how **** of a person Adrian actually was in their relationship. Instead, we get he-said-she-said type of **** that never amounts to much.Compared to the original's charm, it has nothing going for it. The twist is lame and illogical (also predictable), and large parts of the movie just do not add up. For instance, during her daring escape from the mental institute, no one is seeing the people get murdered? They all assume it is her and when she passes by the guard station, you can clearly see cameras, RECORDING EVERYWHERE (as a mental institution does), and yet nothing, no one is saying \"Hey, there's a knife floating and she's either killing men with her mind, or her story is legit.\" Most of the big twists in the movie or the big shock moments also take place in a public setting, so you're telling me that no one in the restaurant saw a knife floating except for her and her sister? You're telling me they couldn't have shown footage in the restaurant of a floating knife??? Do you mean to tell me that the cops didn't go to check the footage? You're going to tell me they didn't see A F***ING KNIFE FLOATING??? Give me a break from reality, but not this big of a disconnect. Also, why does the little girl believe she hit her when she's clearly on the other side of the room? None of it adds up, the only suspense and disbelief comes from how laughably unbelievable the film is at moments.Also, after she shoots and stabs the suit, how would it just blink and go in and out? That's literally not how it would work, once she disconnects/destroys a camera it would act more like a dead pixel that would be constant, it wouldn't make half of the suit blink, did no one explain how electric current and cameras work? Drab. The best way to describe this movie is by calling a drab, drag-fest that goes on for what feels like a f***ing eternity, my theater had people walking out or laughing during highly suspenseful and intelligent dialogue such as \"He's invisible! It means you can't see him!!!\" I mean, wow, so profound, thank you for defining the meaning of \"invisible\", I really needed help on that! I'm not sure how this movie has such high ratings, it was just plain-out bad and predictable at every point. Though the writing doesn't treat the audience as poorly as the writers did in The Dead Don't Die (where they explain the f***ing plot and 'hidden' meaning on multiple occasions), it still feels insulting when they introduce us to plot points that just make literally no sense, and that's the problem with The Invisible Man, it almost makes no sense from start to finish. I also feel like the twist where it was his brother was meant to make us think \"Oh my God! What if it wasn't him!!!!\" but, tbh, at that point, I was so f***ing checked out of the movie I was only thinking \"Jesus f***ing Christ, it's going to keep going for another f***ing 40 minutes.\"",

Although normally I try to keep them in check because so many movies are utterly disappointing. Well I'm happy to say this film completely blew me away. Leigh Whanell has created his masterpiece. A superb update inspired by the invisible man but something completely new altogether. The brilliant Elizabeth Moss stars as Cecelia a damaged woman in an abusive, controlling marriage. As we begin the film she escapes and soon after finds that her ex has committed suicide. Following that she discovers that she will inherit five million dollars as long as she doesn't commit any crimes or is ruled mentally incompetent. All of that is a red herring for what's to come. Soon after she comes to realize that her new found freedom is an illusion and that her sociopathic ex is stalking her but is invisible. I don't want to get into the details because I refuse to spoil this for anyone but wow. From the opening moments Whannel concocts a mounting feeling of chest tightening dread and keeps it uncomfortably fluid throughout. The small moments of laughter and a feeling of freedom are only to distract you from what's coming. And trust me it's worth the wait. The film unfolds unexpectedly is utterly driven by Moss's vulnerable yet resilient performance. She's so smart and driven it's easy to root for her and to relate to her seemingly hopeless plight. The film succeeds in establishing Adrian as an utter monster. And the invisibility is a device that works so well because had he been given a steady face and performance, it would have humanized him. And it's all the more effective that it didn't. Despite being a reimagining this is a really new film. It feels fresh in every aspect and even though you might think you know what's going to happen the utter brilliance in which it's executed is utterly astounding.",

Wells. Fun Fact: this was originally going to be the second movie in the cinematic universe \"Dark Universe\" with Johnny Depp playing the titled character. However, the flop of the Mummy seems to have made Universal focus on standalone Universal monster movies. This new strategy seems to be the right move as The Invisible Man is an absolute thrill of a movie. The general summary of this movie is that Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) who has escaped an abusive relationship from her ex Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) only for weeks later to find out he committed suicide. However, she suspects his death was a hoax and that she is being hunted by someone nobody can see.The biggest praise of this movie has got to be Elisabeth Moss performance.She gives an authentic performance of a character who has been in an abusive relationship.She makes the emotional stakes feel high and her agony feel genuine. However, she is also able to give a ferocity in her performance when her character decides to fight. She does an incredible job in carrying this movie. The score by Benjamin Wallfisch is also incredibly unsettling and intense when it needs to be. It manages to perfectly elevate the scene in every way and really make the audience invested what they are watching. I also have to praise their unique use of camera shots. The director Leigh Whannell uses a lot of wide shots and panning to make it really feel like there is someone else in the room watching our character Cecilia. The story is also really engaging and is a really smart narrative on woman who have been abused or manipulated. The movie has great scares and great suspenseful moments that are not just relying on jump scares(but there are some) and it is just a breath of fresh air for a horror movie.This isn't the director's fault but the trailers kind of ruin a fair amount of the surprise sadly. I highly recommend people don't watch the trailer for this movie cause it will lessen the experience. My biggest issue with this movie is just the amount of plot holes that really make me question things. I will avoid spoiler territory. The first thing I have to question is the lack of cameras? There are security cameras in this world and this movie emphasises cameras but when there is a scene that 100% would have security cameras in the real world, the movie decides it doesn't exist anymore. Also I have to question how a certain character is able to get to get from point a to point b so quick when there is clearly no transportation used by this character. Additionally, this character somehow knows where everyone is just baffling and unexplained. You have to suspend some of your belief to accept these and unfortunately that is kinda difficult especially considering the tech shown in this movie. The last act of this movie also feels really contrasting to the the slower and suspenseful pace of the first two acts of this movie and it kinda makes it feel like a completely different movie. Honestly, I also prefer the first two acts compared to the last one. Overall, this movie is just a great horror movie and a fresh contemporary adaptation of the novel. If you want a unique and vastly different horror movie experience then this movie is a must watch for you.",

In fairness,Over the past few years, Blumhouse Productions has become a money machine, offering low-budget, pulpy horror films (the “Purge” series, “Truth or Dare,” “Happy Death Day,” among others) that do very well at the box office.  In fairness, they’ve also bankrolled serious theatrical efforts like “Get Out” and “BlacKkKlansman.”  “The Invisible Man” moves Blumhouse outside the traditional horror genre.  It’s a film that is part horror film, part action movie, part support for #MeToo.The concept behind this film originated with the 1897 novella “The Invisible Man” by H.G. Wells, generally acknowledged as the father of science fiction.  This film also owes a debt to the 1933 film with the same name, starring Claude Rains.In the hands of Writer/Director Leigh Whannell (the “Saw” series), the content and focus of this movie is changed dramatically from the original source material.  In fact, the man we sometimes can’t see is actually only a tangential character in the story.  The protagonist is Cecelia Kass (Elisabeth Moss), the long-suffering live-in partner of a rich genius who works in field of optics.  A total control freak, the optics inventor has abused Cecelia in every way imaginable.  After escaping from the fenced-in fortress where she lives with this madman, Cecelia is further persecuted by a series of mysterious events.  Her former boyfriend has donned a body suit that refracts light, rendering him invisible as he performs a series of increasingly horrific misdeeds.   Blood flows. Cecelia is accused of madness and murder.  The game is afoot, Watson.What makes this film rise about the typical Blumhouse dreck is Elisabeth Moss, who has had memorable roles in several iconic TV series including “West Wing,” “Mad Men,” “Top of the Lake,” and most recently “The Handmaid’s Tale.”  Here, Moss offers an acting tour de force.  Her character evolves from terrorized abuse victim to action figure to cold-blooded avenging angel.  As her character transforms, Moss’ facial expressions and body language also evolve strikingly.  If you can get past all the blood, it’s an evolution worth watching.Because this is Blumhouse, who gave us masterpieces such as “The Gallows Act II” (a record-tying 0% on Rotten Tomatoes) and the currently-playing “Fantasy Island” (checking in at 9%), effective plotting is not a strong point in “The Invisible Man.”  For example, while housed on a secure psychiatric ward, Cecelia simply opens the unlocked door to the stairwell, helpfully labelled “Emergency Exit,” to make her escape.  Some of the plot twists made me yearn for the GEICO commercial with the immortal line, “Let’s hide behind the chain saws!”“The Invisible Man” is a worthy addition to the pulp noir genre.  With no particular skills, Moss’ character overcomes impossible odds to preserve her sanity and right wrongs.  Along the way, the cinematography is notably flashy and fascinating.  However, it’s Moss, and Moss alone, who elevates this film and makes the whole endeavor worthwhile.",

Elizabeth Moss is terrific as an abused wife who plans and executes her escape from her abusive husband.  Just when she thinks her troubles are over, she finds out they are not.

Wells are stretched to their \"2020-iest,\" and followers of the adaptation process's limitless possibilities have yet another feather in their cap in the form of Leigh Whannell's \"The Invisible Man,\" an ambitious, imaginative and twisted return to form for one of Universal's underappreciated \"monster\" properties. Whannell capitalizes and even improves on everything that surprised me about his last entry, \"Upgrade,\" distributing the kinetics of his film in a more even and structurally friendly fashion, using the frame as an antagonist that's just as terrifying to look at as it is impossible to look away from. The narrative is sumptuously deceiving, yet structurally recognizable enough to make you think you know where things are headed, even though the exact destination isn't where you figured you'd end up. The production design and cinematography are sleek, ultimately pairing with the respective looks of his previous films to give Whannell what I'd even call an aesthetic in the making. And though it really shocks me to say it, I find myself really intrigued at the prospect of more Universal monster movies with this treatment of the source material in mind. I'd consider that a success on the part of those involved.",

As the story begins, Elizabeth Moss, who looks miserable and frightened for most of the movie, is sneaking out of the house and the relationship that's ruining her life. The boyfriend wants her back and uses his innovative optical technology to stalk and terrify her. Director Leigh Whannell (best known for the Saw and Insidious films) has kept the first third of the film very low-key with ominous promise.

SheCecilia’s (Elisabeth Moss) abusive ex Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) commits suicide and leaves her his fortune. The relief that he is gone from her life is short lived as a series of very strange occurrences begin to happen to her. She suspects Adrian’s death was a hoax and he has found a way to haunt her without anyone seeing. How does she convince everyone that she is being terrorized by something invisible?First off I had low expectations for The Invisible Man after watching the trailer, I felt it had bad horror movie written all over it. Not only that, but The Invisible Man was supposed to be one of the many monster movies in the Dark Universe franchise. A franchise that failed after one movie, you can all go ahead and blame Tom Cruise’s Mummy movie for that one. But The Invisible Man is not that kind of movie. The opening scene sets the tone of the type of movie you will be watching, taking a real life frightening situation and builds a horror movie around it. It uses everything at its disposal to keep you in a constant state of unease. From the camera work to the score and absolutely everything that Elisabeth Moss is doing. She really is superb in this, her facial expressions and stunt work are brilliant. I thought The Handmaid’s Tale was showing us Elisabeth Moss’s full range of emotional capabilities but she is well and truly pushed to her limits with this performance.Everything about The Invisible Man pushes it away from your average horror. It doesn’t restrict itself to one genre, yes it is for the most part a horror movie but it’s also dealing with a very serious subject matter. The physically and emotionally abusive relationship and the aftermath of that. It raises issues of how we treat victims of abuse and the devastating effect it can have on one’s mental and physical health. It’s incredibly tense, unexpectedly horrifying and jam packed with frights. It will make you jump out of your skin and with plenty of stress inducing moments you’ll be on the edge of your seat. I’m impressed with how this movie has been reinvented to suit today’s audience. It is well worth taking the time to see, highly recommended.",

Thus what you're waiting is for him to do something. You as a viewer are waiting for the jump scare, so because of that the tension has gone out the window.I cannot understand how people can say the genre lacks originality and then after seeing it they come and say is great.The film is full of plot holes, devastating plot holes. Don't even talk about the cliches and it's a shame but considering the story tried to turn around by focusing on the abuse of women, Whannell cannot avoid falling into the same mistakes over and over again, showing completely repetitive situations.Instead of deepening the abuse and mental harassment, the film resorts to the same topics as the protagonist is unable to make the people around her believe what is happening and that's the limitation the horror genre imposes over the story.You just have to look at the scene where her sister is killed because is just ridiculous. No cameras in the restaurant and no smartphone from any of the diners in a full restaurant that could record or take a picture of a strange floating knife. Absurd.And although the invisible suit is crazy, at least you can believe it because after all the film is based on that but what I thought was disastrous is that the suit apparently gives super powers to the wearer. When the guy gets rid of all the guards in the hallway the brute force of his punches is unbelievable, all the guards seemed to be hit with concrete. What more can I say?Elisabeth Moss delivers but the script barely helps her and that frankly at the end of it all is the structural failure of this film, which depends totally on how gullible you are for it to work.",

It's a film that really requires a suspension of disbelief right from the get go in order to enjoy some jumpscares throughout. Essentially a ripoff of \"Gaslight,\" \"Hollow Man,\" and \"Enough\" in a premise right up front with massive holes. The CGI effects are terrible, as the killer looks like something more out of the 90s in the way he flashes around versus at least having equal quality to that as the aforementioned Hollow Man or even Terminator 2. So we are told he's some kind of genius optics scientist, meanwhile his appearance looks terrible by scientific standards. We are made to believe that the protagonist in the film has no friends, no family outside of her sister, and no alternative other than to stick within 15 miles of where the killer resides.  One key plot point that is poorly explained is how there was no police-based death certificate or verification of his death in the way it is presented. Meanwhile, Cecilia is constantly around her police friend James, so something doesn't add up. Even as I type this, I realize how preposterous the whole movie was.Look, like typical Blumhouse fare, if you're looking to bring your girlfriend/boyfriend for  some jumpscares amidst over the top musical scoring (reminded me of something Tarantino would parody), this movie is for you. But even if the age of Harvey Weinstein, there is nothing compelling here storywise beyond that, and it's clear that Blumhouse is a profit shop trying to exploit the #MeToo era of sincere issues. The villain Adrian and his motives for violence are poorly developed, the story has gaping holes in logic, and you can only look at the protagonist uglied up and deranged looking for so many minutes before you say to yourself \"I Get the Point.\" Really, an awful movie - the only reason I give it 2/10 instead of 1/10 is so people don't dismiss the review.",

Finally, they make a good scary movie type film this year, since all the thrillers and scary movies that have already come out have been garbage. I'm glad this film redeemed this year so far. I am going to watch it again in theatres soon. This is a \"watch 100 times and never get bored of it\" type of movie.

The Invisible Man 2020 is essentially a Hollow Man re-skin except without the awesome special effects and plausable invisibility tech creation storyline of the latter. In fact there's absolutely zero explanation as to how The Invisible Man 2020 invisibility tech was created or why. It's presented in a cliche Tony Stark / Bruce Wayne style. The well-worn origin story of a rich, genius man's gadget filled basement in a mansion but this time there happens to be an invisibility suit there. This method of introduction just seems out of place for one of the most important discoveries in human history.The motivations of the villain in The Invisible Man 2020 (Adrian) seem solely that of a domestic violence perpetrator. Unfortunately there's almost no character development for Adrian apart from a few glimpses of him before he turns into the Invisible Man so it's quite difficult to relate to his extreme and ridiculously complex reaction to Cecilia ending their relationship. Then it's straight into the invisible revenge craziness which quickly becomes far to elaborate to be believable even in a fantasy way.In all honesty, in the invisibility genre Hollow Man is a better movie. It's scarier, more disturbing and ultimately more complete of an invisibility fantasy movie and demonstrates well the absolute power of invisibility corrupting absolutely.",

Oh, wait it's just Trip Fontaine panicking over The Invisible Man. Relax Trip! Catch your breath! I know we both viewed this film this week, but it's over now. No one is following you. You're much better looking than Elisabeth Moss. No way her crazy husband would want to follow you when he could do much worse. Anyway, we saw the remake/current day adaptation of The Invisible Man.Trip: Don't worry! I'm not scared. I'm never scared... except when Elisabeth Moss' crazy eyes are staring me down. So, yeah, I didn't, but should have, realized that this was an adaptation of H.G. Wells' The Invisible Man. That didn't entirely register with me until after the fact. Duh!This The Invisible Man was written and directed by Leigh Whannell, and I'll call it a modern adaptation inspired by Wells' book. Elisabeth Moss plays Cecilia Kass, a woman who escapes a controlling relationship and her menacing, optics mogul beau, Adrian Griffin, played by Oliver Jackson-Cohen. Not to give too much away but Adrian commits suicide and Cecilia thinks he's haunting her or is she just crazy - hijinks ensue(See The Trailer).To be honest, I walked into the theater knowing exactly what was going to happen. There was only one legitimate plot twist that surprised me. In fact, my jaw may still be on the floor from that. Otherwise, this movie was a paint-by-numbers psychological thriller. Characters, specifically Moss' Cecilia, make decisions that make absolutely no sense solely to further the story. Characters don't say things that make any sense and do say things that no one would ever say, which was very frustrating. The script is cliched and predictable; but, of course, The Invisible Man original was published in the 19th century and has been adapted many times over. I would have hoped that Whannell could have done something truly original with the psychological thriller.Elisabeth Moss is generally good here. She has the face of a woman who is being terrorized. She's got these eyes that just bore into you. She does not need to do much to convincingly portray crazy, but she also is powerful. I do not fault Moss for the overall shortcomings of the movie. I'll also commend the design of Adrian Griffin's home. It is cold and angular, and exactly what you would expect of a rich, optics guys. The isolation and starkness of the surrounding echoes the relationship that haunts Cecilia.S2S: More like she has a face that terrorizes...This is the only role she should play because it comes so naturally to her angular face. But that's neither here nor there... continue my friend.Trip: *ignores comments* The visual effects are hit or miss. There is a fight sequence that seems either poorly edited or the visual effects are inconsistent.S2S: I'd agree the visual effects were hit or miss. In fact, the visual effects were just as inconsistent as the escape plan given to us in the beginning. Yet, the effects also added a bunch to the cool aspects of action sequences and the intensity of anxiety. So what she flies across the kitchen as if he some how has superpowers and her head is independent from her body *sarcasm abounds*...Trip: Well, even though The Invisible Man is hardly original and is fairly predictable, if you know that walking into the theater, is it worthy of a viewing? I would still say yes. There are jump scares that don’t feel entirely cheap. This is what you came for. As I stated before, there is one plot twist that is almost worth the price of admission itself. Ultimately, it is fun and satisfying – not scary, if that what you want, but thrilling nonetheless. I say worth a trip to the big screen with a popcorn to spill at those shocking moments.S2S: I mean I generally agree with you but I think our readers deserve a little bit more. This movie is definitely a popcorn muncher but is it necessary to see on the big screen because of 2 good scenes? I think you can pass the movie theater ticket but you won’t be completely disappointed, if you did. This is at best a matinee movie but definitely a RedBox rental type of flick.",

Wells's original The Invisible Man (1897) suggests that rather than something as powerful as invisibility being used for the betterment ofStarts brilliantly but ultimately undermines itself with plot contrivances and genre foolishnessH.G. Wells's original The Invisible Man (1897) suggests that rather than something as powerful as invisibility being used for the betterment of mankind, it would instead be used to fulfil private desires, ultimately leading to the moral corruption of otherwise good men. However, despite the centrality of this theme in the core story, reframing the template as a tale of domestic abuse and PTSD, as happens in this latest adaptation, which focuses not on the male scientist but on a female victim of his, is a fascinating idea. But fascination only gets you so far, and what could have been an insightful film eventually proves itself incapable of using issues of domestic abuse as anything other than plot points to get from one predictable scare to the next.The film begins as Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) is putting into motion a plan to leave her domineering and abusive boyfriend, Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), a wealthy pioneer in optics. Having drugged him, she leaves their high-tech home in the middle of the night and is picked up nearby by her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer). Although assured that Adrian can't find her, Cecilia is suffers from agoraphobia and paranoia until Adrian commits suicide. Contacted by his brother Tom (Michael Dorman), who's handling his estate, Cecilia learns that Adrian has left her $5 million. However, despite her best efforts to move on, she just can't shake the feeling that Adrian is still around, watching her, sometimes even in the same room as her.Written and directed by Leigh Whannell, this latest adaptation of Wells's original is not actually about the invisible man. Indeed, short of a background shot of him lying in bed, a shot showing only his torso as he runs through a forest, and a close-up of his hand, actor Oliver Jackson-Cohen doesn't even appear on screen prior to his apparent suicide. Adrian is not only the invisible man of the plot, so too is his character ideologically invisible. Which makes its own statement, and it's a statement worth making – men like him don't need to be present to continue to cause harm. In this sense, at least initially, the film is more concerned with the fear Adrian has instilled in Cecilia. Along the same lines, it looks at issues of how women who accuse powerful men of gaslighting are often ignored or disbelieved.Aesthetically, the film looks terrific, particularly Stefan Duscio's cinematography, into which is built Cecilia's paranoia. For example, countless scenes involve the camera panning away from her, moving across the room, showing us nothing at all, and then panning back. Ordinarily, this would be textbook unmotivated camera movement, but here it conveys how Cecelia fears there may be something in the corner to which we panned. There are also many shots which in another film would be awful framing; isolating Cecilia in the frame and filling up so much of the screen's real-estate with empty negative space. Except, again, in this film, such negative space has an ominousness not applicable to regular thrillers.But, I had a lot of problems with this film. For one thing, we know from the get-go that Cecilia isn't imagining things, that Adrian faked his suicide and is now stalking her whilst invisible. Granted, this is kind of unavoidable given how well-known the property is, but had the film allowed for even a little bit of ambiguity, it could have done wonders for emotional complexity, turning a story about invisibility into a story possibly about mental collapse. Another thing that bothered me is that in a film so focused on surveillance and privacy, there are several scenes where if there is even one functioning CCTV camera, the movie ends. A pivotal scene in a restaurant is an especially egregious example of this – one grainy image from a camera, and Cecilia can prove she's not going nuts and the whole plot unravels.However, my biggest problem is that what starts as a fascinating study of the lasting ramifications of domestic violence ultimately descends into genre stupidity. The fact that Whannell ultimately undermines himself in this way, deploying such important themes merely to get him to the gory dénouement, is especially frustrating insofar as he genuinely did originally seem to have some interesting things to say. Tied to this is that Adrian is introduced as such an abhorrent character from the start, void of nuance or subtlety. Domestic abusers aren't monotone evil-doers, oftentimes, they're very charming on the surface, and any film claiming to be a serious examination of this topic would make room to address this.The Invisible Man left me disappointed and frustrated. Initially positioning itself as an allegory for the difficulty victims of domestic abuse have in moving on with their lives even after the abuser is gone, it eventually privileges genre beats and cheap thrills over emotional complexity.",
