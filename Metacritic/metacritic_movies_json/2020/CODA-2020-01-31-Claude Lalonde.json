It is simple, in a way; beautifully simple, and simply beautiful. The commonplace themes of fear, love, and loss are certainly universal, but no less profound for that. Perhaps I am biased, as I myself am a musician with no confidence--if one is looking for an action-packed adventure, this is not that. It is, instead, quietly passionate. Sir Patrick Stewart gives a compelling, powerfully moving performance (indeed, I don't think I've ever seen him give anything else). Katie Holmes is very natural, genuine, intense but most charming. Even Giancarlo Esposito is quite memorable, although his character gets relatively little screen time--he's sort of the voice of reason, keeping everyone from falling into themselves, as it were.Not that long, small cast, a great deal of silence and natural beauty... simple, as I said. Yet it has found a special place in my heart, and I hope that if you see it, you feel the same.",
