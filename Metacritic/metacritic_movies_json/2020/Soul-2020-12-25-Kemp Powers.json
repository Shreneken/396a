But one small misstep takes him from the streets of New York City to The Great Before – a fantastical place where new souls get their personalities, quirks and interests before they go to Earth. Determined to return to his life, Joe teams up with a precocious soul, 22, who has never understood the appeal of the human experience. As Joe desperately tries to show 22 what’s great about living, he may just discover the answers to some of life’s most important questions.… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Great animation can communicate wildly complex ideas with head-spinning clarity and wit, as Docter capably proved with Inside Out – a film which staged the interplay of emotions in an 11-year-old’s head like a vintage sitcom. If anything, Soul pushes this capacity for revelation even further: there are moments of true Blakean mystery and wonder here, expressed with a crispness that feels like a lightbulb snapping on above your head.",
    "Here is a strikingly beautiful, bold, funny, heart-tugging otherworldly journey almost dizzying in its multi-leveled complexity, and yet containing the simplest and most enduring Capra-esque messages about how we don’t know what we’ve got until it’s gone, and how we should embrace every waking moment because it can all vanish in the blink of an eye.",
    "It all blends together beautifully, a marriage of Pixar’s square, safe, feel-good sensibility with what could be described as the “real world” — and one that, much as “Inside Out” anthropomorphized the mind, will leave audiences young and old imagining their own souls as glowing idiosyncratic cartoon characters.",
    "Pixar’s 23rd animated feature is an exercise in psychedelic existentialism that astonishingly increases in inventiveness as it goes along. Then, before you’re overwhelmed, it shifts into a lower gear, eventually arriving as a stirring and relatively simple meditation on what it means to be alive.",
    "It’s a ravishing ode, too, to gestures, touches, smiles, and pithy, pointless conversations; in Soul the tiny human interactions that we so often brush over come under the magnifying glass.",
    "It’s a deeply sweet, happy, gentle film.",
    "Moving ever-onward from the sequels years, Pixar gets right back in the zone with Soul. Deep, witty, and fast on its jazz-loving feet, it doesn’t miss a beat.",
    "Visually glorious, frequently very funny and genuinely profound, this is a picture which cries out to be seen on the big screen.",
    "This densely packed, exquisitely executed and just a teensy bit batshit film is peak Pixar. It's a vintage mix of the company's intricate storytelling, complex emotional intelligence, technical prowess and cerebral whimsy on dexamethasone.",
    "Pixar’s first feature with a predominantly Black cast and a Black lead actor (the superb Jamie Foxx) contemplates the origins of jazz and the meaning of life and death. Don't fret the metaphysics, kids, It's the year's peak achievement in animation.",
    "Like the best moments in Up or Wall-E or Inside Out, the alchemy of Soul's final scenes find Pixar at its most stirring and enduring, a marshmallow puff of surreal whimsy that somehow lightly touches the profound.",
    "Soul feels like the best Pixar movies used to feel — deeply humanistic, with both silly, kid-friendly humor and a sincere solemnity that feels entirely adult. Docter and Powers weaponize all of this in a story that literally and directly questions the meaning of life.",
    "Soul likes jazz very much. That’s a rare certainty in this ambitious film, which attempts to contemplate nothing less than the root of all human experience on this planet.",
    "Like some of the best jazz compositions, it uses a traditional framework to veer off in many unexpected directions, so that even the inevitable end point feels just right.",
    "Soul stuffs its playful optimism into a simple message and delivers it with colorful, endearing beauty.",
    "Credit Pixar veteran Pete Docter (\"Up\" and \"Inside Out\") and co-director Kemp Powers (the writer of the play and upcoming movie \"One Night in Miami\") with an addition to Pixar's library worthy of its classics.",
    "It’s a small, delicate movie that doesn’t hit every note perfectly, but its combination of skill, feeling and inspiration is summed up in the title.",
    "Soul wasn’t made for a world that’s just gone through the nightmares of 2020, but coming out at the end of this harrowing year, it couldn’t feel more poignant. It’s funny, and it’s imaginative, but it’s also just very, very real.",
    "I think Soul will become a classic, but we must be patient too, because this stretch of the film is mostly illustrated notions, heavier on explanation than action. It’s very pretty—Klee-like figures and lots of pastel translucency—but not, perhaps inevitably, all that lively.",
    "Soul asks its audience to examine what in life truly is important. You never know what your spark might be, until suddenly you do. And it might not be what you think. Turns out you may have had it all along.",
    "At times, Soul is as heavy as it sounds, and invites all sorts of contemplation from viewers about our purpose on this planet, and whatever (and wherever) comes afterwards. At other times, it is uproariously funny, particularly after Joe and 22’s story takes a very unexpected turn in its second half. In typical Pixar fashion, it’s also visually stunning.",
    "Soul turns out to be not an exploration of the afterlife but a wondrous whirligig of daily life.",
    "Soul is messy, maudlin, funny, ridiculous, and poignant. In other words, it has soul.",
    "Soul amounts to more than technical wizardry and intelligent dialogue. Why artists keep pounding the pavement despite never finding commercial success is a meaty topic.",
    "Without becoming doctrinaire or espousing a particular religious ideology, Soul offers insight into the concept of death and the potential of an afterlife. It does this while maintaining a light tone and avoiding many of the obvious pitfalls that could accompany addressing such subject matter.",
    "A holiday gift, it’s bringing some much-needed light to these dark days.",
    "Soul is dealing with themes that may even be beyond its grasp. The idea of creative passions becoming a reason for living has been a recurring thread through most Pixar films, but Soul attempts to dig deeper. And while it may not find one perfect discernible answer, it’s a search that feels inherently…soulful.",
    "If you’ve seen enough of the studio’s movies, even something this full of imagination suffers from some predictability. There is a period in Soul, where, in spite of the lovely creativity and goofy story-telling, it lags and feels a bit listless, before bouncing back.",
    "The originality of vision remains strong with Pete Docter and his cohorts. But beyond strange new concepts, they need to dig deeper for more truly unexpected characters.",
    "The visuals are as wildly original as the script, which was co-written by Docter, Kemp Powers, and Mike Jones.",
    "It’s whimsical and bold and also easier to admire in the abstract than to get deeply emotionally invested in, though it features a late-breaking burst of beauty that will soften the hardest of hearts.",
    "It’s a visually sumptuous riot of ideas, pitched somewhere between a playful musical, a divine comedy and a metaphysical drama.",
    "The more you think about it, the more of a muddle Soul seems to be. But what a gorgeous muddle it is. It may not be wholly satisfying, but it is exhilarating in its ambition, superbly animated, and brimming with affection for its characters and their milieu.",
    "The title, with its built-in weightiness ... well, it’s a tall order, one this latest Pixar animated feature falls just short of. The dominant mood here is not so much soulful as spirited, which is still better than most – and a most welcome gift.",
    "Soul is a jazzy and profound riff on humanity and the hereafter, an entertaining, exuberant effort about our existence with comedic shenanigans, deep thoughts and wondrous imagination.",
    "The beauty of Soul is that, just as animation is finding more being demanded of it, Pixar is answering that demand. It is making the case for animation as an ideal vehicle for exploring the grand, the general, the universal.",
    "Despite some distraction and not quite enough music, Soul manages to tap into deep emotion as its characters explore the limits of mortality and what it means to be passionate about life.",
    "There is a mesmerizing quality to the movie.",
    "\"Cars\" and its various derivatives aside, Pixar has never released a flat-out bad film. And this is a good one: pleasant and clever, with a generous heart, committed voice acting, and some of the kookiest images in Pixar history.",
    "It’s overflowing, like a bright portal into a new reality, with gorgeous details. So what if they don’t quite add up to a deeper whole?",
    "It’s comical, but not really a comedy, spiritual without being all that deep. But as it grapples with what drives a creative person, paints the “after life” and “before life” eternity in Picasso-with-a-light-pen strokes and questions what makes life worth living, it can be quite touching.",
    "There are many elaborate lessons on life and how to live it in Soul, though its best may ironically be its simplest: Look. Listen. Learn. Enjoy. You may not turn the film off with an answer to what a soul is. But you may find yourself wondering if you’re forgetting to occasionally connect with your own.",
    "The lingering lesson of Soul, a lovely, imperfect movie about life’s lovely imperfections, is that every moment is worth living to the fullest, this one very much included.",
    "Like every Pixar movie, it’s entertaining, sharp, and visually inventive. But it lacks the thunderbolts of creativity that make the company’s best philosophical inquiries so electrifying. It never quite finds its spark.",
    "While Soul offers food for thought and has heart, it’s never quite as funny, engrossing, or emotionally rewarding as Pixar’s best.",
    "Soul is perhaps the most existentially ambitious film ever attempted by Disney and yet it pops with colorful visuals and gentle wisdom while the story clips along despite the dizzying height of the concept. Only in the final stages do the knots of plot complexity get the better of the characters, but audiences will have been well won over by then.",
    "Just as a movie skewed toward kids will bore adults, Soul will bore children, and it did mine. I love jazz, but I don’t think my child will add it to her Spotify playlist. In the end, Soul told a good, insightful story but was too much of a departure from the norm.",
    "This dazzling, if ultimately frustrating, movie seems to pick up where the far superior “Inside Out” ended, leaving behind the inner workings of young people’s emotional lives for an exploration of metaphysical realms that are fuzzier, more speculative and, to put it bluntly, not nearly as involving.",
    "While most Pixar films pride themselves on presenting rich, fantastical responses to real-world wonderings, Soul keeps conjuring up visions that don’t correspond precisely enough to anything in the real world.",
    "If anything, Soul is guilty of over-ambition. The wizardry and wit is there, but it lacks Pixar’s usual deftness in making complex themes sing for youngsters. Mixing heart and existential angst, it’ll connect more with Joe’s generation than little ones. It’s smart and, yes, soulful but it never quite takes flight.",
    "Overall, the movie is so ambitious—so intent on reminding us, every minute, that it really is a work of Big Ideas—that it ends up subverting its own charms. The Pixar masterminds often seem to think complicated is better, or at least just deeper. But to paraphrase Thelonious Monk, they’ve been making the wrong mistakes.",
    "It’s a movie with the sort of resonance, thoughtfulness and universality that audiences of all descriptions will enjoy — and, more importantly, connect with.",
    "What lets the film down somewhat is an issue that has dogged much of the studio’s recent middling efforts, namely an inert narrative and a wishy-washy message that ultimately doesn’t have the courage of its own convictions.",
    "Soul isn't Pixar's finest or most resonant film, but its beautiful animation and soundtrack, paired with fun characters make for an enjoyable watch.",
    "While not quite offering the emotional gut-punch it promises, its many ideas never completely cohering, Soul is nevertheless a gorgeous and tender existential trip. It’s full of surprises."

It has breathtaking visuals, amazing music, and a great cast. Richard Ayoade keeps on being one of the best actors no one seems to recognize. The visual ideas are really inventive and interesting, \"The zone\" being one of the most creative things I have seen in a film. The montage towards the end of the film made me cry, and is peak Pixar. Pretty much every scene spent in the spirit realm is really great. The scenes on earth is more of a problem. They have a bit of a whiplash effect, after the creativity on display in the spirit realm. Another problem is the weird, essentially tangential part where the protagonist is turned into a cat. I really appreciate that 22 got to be a human, but couldn't she just discover the wonders of the world as a cat? Anyway, I really liked this movie, despite its mistakes. It isn't very funny, which is a bit of a sad trend with modern Pixar, but it is still pretty great. It reminds me of the glory days of pixar, of Ratatouille and Wall-e and Up. I really hope this might usher in other films like that. And also that they stop making movies like Onward.",

Not because anything was too ambitious or deep, it was more how disjointed the story seemed to be between the living world and spirit world. I don't want to ruin anything but there are things that happen that flat out made zero sense and had my head scratching, especially in the last quarter of the movie. Also when the cat thing happened I was kinda like....I guess that has to be for the children because that route made way less sense to me than a fusion situation, where they were BOTH operating. It's one of those you have to just accept it's a fictional movie kind of deals.I really enjoyed most of the characters a lot. Terry was my biggest gripe character-wise. I get you aren't supposed to like him and he's arguably the only antagonist if there is one, but he was just a means to an end obviously. I just felt like there was a struggle to connect the two realms to further the story in the writers room. There was a lot of hurrying things along near the end.Overall a good movie that conveys a message about how our desire to seek purpose (and how those purposes can become obsessions) can take away from really \"living\" life.

Los personajes son muy carismáticos y la animación es de lo mejor que he visto, pero si hablo de las cosas que no me gustaron, siento que la película rompe con la seriedad que transmite en algunas situaciones de comedia como cuando Joe se convierte en el gato, se siente como la parte mas débil de la película. Una película animada que toca tantos temas complejos y serios necesita equilibrar mucho mas su comedia y que se note menos forzada. Y después esta el tema de que siento que no explotan el mundo de fantasía que propone. Se menciona el gran despues, el infierno y el gran antes, pero creo que le falto un poquito mas de desarrollo. En su lugar, la película trata de explorar mas la vida de Joe.En mi opinión, no es una de las mejores películas animadas que he visto de todos los tiempos, pero definitivamente es una de las mejores que he visto en los últimos años.

It had me thinking who I would like to be and what I could be. Although I didn’t find the answer in 2-hours it had me wondering, what is THE spark that makes me, me?Visually, this film is spectacular. At times I would forget that it was an animated film, but this aspect had me more invested into the incredible story. I think each individual who watches this film will have a different take and level of emotional response. Speaking for myself. At the end of the day I didn’t feel the emotional heartstrings being tugged at, but I honestly felt like my soul had been moved to want more and to be better.The last takeaway to this film is head up. Take each day for what it is and live it to your fullest because you may never get the opportunity for a do over or second chance. Be kind to yourself and those around you, as it may trodden them in such a way that they lose hope or faith in who they are and who they are meant to be.Overall:Honestly, this is a must see film before the year is up. It’s visually stunning, thought provoking, and emotionally driven. Admittedly, I did have my doubts and thought this film would fall short of my expectations, which was 10/10, but instead it met them, which was a 10/10.Enjoy the show!",

Right after getting his chance do play at a Jazz club with other talented musicians that he thinks will give his life meaning he dies and in trying to return to his life he ends up with an unborn soul named 22, who for thousands of years has been avoiding living.

Through this new perspective on life, 22 learns to put aside all of her preconceived notions about life on Earth and Joe comes to realization that it's the little things, not your passion, that make life meaningful.

However, after watching the film, I think people will realize that that's not the case. The way the soul world is intertwined with the real world can be a bit confusing at times, but is executed beautifully overall. This film is probably  the most mature-themed Pixar movie I've seen. The visuals are absolutely stunning, and the storytelling is executed very well. This is probably one of the few movies that has hit close to home with me, and I can see it doing the same with others. I love to see that Pixar is constantly innovating and finding new ways to speak to the audience personally. I understand if some might not like the theme because of it's complicated nature, and it's more mature target audience, and that's okay.

I'm not sure why Pixar thought making a film for kids about midlife crisis, existentialism and general meaning of life, with jazz and no child characters was a good idea.  Each of our boys (8,6,2) drifted off to play with Lego etc, and they NEVER do that. There seemed to be very little to which they could relate. There are almost no children in the film, my kids aren't big on jazz, and it wasn't very colourful for large parts. There was a (quite sensible) talking cat and a bit where characters poop whole slices of pizza. They liked those bits.  IMO Disney can't hold a flame to Miyazaki when it comes to the mystical and this film really proved the point.  But compared to other Pixar offerings it doesn't have the charm of Up or the cleverness of Inside Out. But Soul's big failing is it just isn't very much fun.",

I'd say I barely enjoyed watching it and will probably not see it another time. This movie honestly feels like it's trying to imitate Pixar's Inside Out, but does so with disingenuous material and does it poorly.We follow our main guy Joe along his life being obsessed with music and finally getting the gig he wants only to fall into a sewer and die. From there we get to see the Great Beyond and the Great Before; terms that become problematic when talking about any actual afterlife that the movie makes neatly side step by saying that's all in the beyond.Joe is able to avoid the Beyond (only to put a time limit on his actions and to trick him into thinking he's special) and escapes to the Before, where he proceeds to get back to his body even at the cost of stealing other's lives. Joe constantly shows he's selfish and doesn't care about others and only changes after he destroys a life and only through Deus Machina fixes it.Combined with a lot of psych nonsense rhetoric, anti-christian hints, and naive view of life makes this movie feel like a way of tricking the next generation the way Disney did the previous: feelings are all that matter.",

With the help of a lost and rebellious soul by his side, he must try to get back into his own body while also learning about the joys of living along the way. Pixar almost never fails to put a smile on my face, even with some of their lesser efforts in the past, and this one is no exception in the smiles department for me. However, it also turned out to be one of their most mature and ambitious efforts to date! Complete with beautiful and colorful visuals, a great voice cast led by Jamie Foxx, a touching and often times funny story, a universal theme for anybody to relate to, and even a mature and impressive musical score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, it's sure to be enjoyed by just about anybody and will hopefully even make you appreciate the little things in life more! There are some familiar-feeling story beats at times, but they're more than made up for through the gorgeous animation and storytelling that Pixar's become so beloved for over the years. Overall, it may not necessarily be one of Pixar's tear-jerker flicks, and while only feeling a little formulaic in a scene or two, the film's heartwarming and unique enough to stand out as one of Pixar's best recent triumphs to date!",

The journey of selfSoul in my humble opinion is the most imaginative and philosophical movie Pixar has ever made. It delves into the meaning of life, the great Before and After, the purpose of our existence and the spark of our soul. The journey of self discovery is one we must all undertake, some sooner, some later, some never. All this is well addressed in Soul, in a very metaphysical way. Pixar animation just keeps getting better - reflections of lights on the glass panes of pictures, mottled rust on aging metro rail pillars, hazy sunlight filtered through autumn leaves. Just such a delight to watch this bustling realistic world of New York unfold. Soul is probably the most musically authentic of all Pixar movies, diving deep into Jazz and other genres. But at the end the message remains paramount - see the forest beyond the trees, see the ocean beyond the waters. Life isn’t one big moment, it’s lots of little moments, treasure them all.",

The animation was astounding, it was gorgeous and the character designs were stupendous and so original especially the designs of the souls, the Jerry's, and Terry. The writing was remarkable especially the story, it was beautiful, touching, deep, and shows us that no matter what we do the most important thing in life is to just be happy and that there is no right answer of how to live our lives just that to be happy with what we do with our lives. I loved how original the concept was for a Pixar and animated movie, it was outstanding. The music was exceptional, one of the best musical scores of all time. The voice acting was phenomenal especially from Tina Fey, Jamie Foxx, Rachel House, Alice Braga, Richard Ayode, Phylicia Rashad, and Angela Bassett.

This is a huge step up in quality from Pixar’s previous film Onward from last year. For reference, I gave Onward a 5/10. Soul has probably the most gorgeous animation in a Pixar film and I know saying that good animation in a Pixar film is like saying water is wet but I really wanted to highlight it here because it’s incredibly gorgeous. The way Pete Docter and the animators incorporate different colors and shots for both the spirit world and New York is beyond amazing. Some might be glad to know that this film doesn’t feel like Inside Out 2 like most were predicting. They only spend maybe 1/4 or 1/3 of the movie in the spirit world and I really enjoyed a lot of the metaphysical jokes they made and the art style of it. It distinguished itself from Inside Out by doing this. The story and themes here are captivating. We learn through Jamie Foxx’s character Joe that we need to slow down and not devout ourselves to only one idea or else we will get stuck in that pit never get out. There is also a lot about our purpose and what we should do with our life which is represented through Tina Fey’s character 22. It’s surprising at how mature these themes are even for a film that is geared towards a younger audience. I have to talk about the music too because it’s great. Scratch that, it’s incredible. It’s almost all jazz music and it fits the themes and tones of the film perfectly. You couldn’t ask for a better score than this. My issues with the film are with its ending and one performance; Graham Norton. I think Norton is a fine talk show host but it was distracting whenever he was on screen here. They probably should have cast somebody else because his performance was average at best compared to the great performances from Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey. The ending of this film is a little bit abrupt and a tad underwhelming. We get this absolutely incredible Jazz section with Joe reflecting on life before it takes us to a more normal ending and I kinda wish the film had been resolved in a better way. I still think the ending is good but it could have been better. If you enjoy Pixar movies or just animated movies in general then I would highly recommend this.",
