  "critic_reviews": [
    "Has the same mixture of dumb puns, corny sight gags and sly, even sophisticated in-jokes. It's a lot of fun.",
    "Crammed with show-biz jokes that younger kids won't fathom, but the action is so quick and colorful that they probably won't mind.",
    "It's often surprisingly clever, dripping with respect for its model, and done with considerable wit and style.",
    "Beautifully regenerates the Jay Ward TV show its characters were based on.",
    "So quick that the flat moments are rapidly, inevitably chased by a new gag.",
    "This megastar mix of CGI animation and live action is remarkably faithful to the spirit of the original.",
    "The problem with the movie isn't that it sells out Rocky and Bullwinkle -- it's that it can't keep up with them.",
    "Hit-or-miss comedy at its best and worst: When it connects, the belly laughs are long and loud, but when it misses, the groans you'll be hearing are your own.",
    "Never asks its target audience of self-referential baby boomers and their littles bundles of joy to take it more seriously than it takes itself.",
    "Does go on too long, leading to inevitable dead spots.",
    "Has some good throwaway gags -- but far too often, the moviemakers don't throw them away soon enough.",
    "These are pitch-perfect impersonations rather than performances.",
    "Hardly a project worthy of grown men and women.",
    "Succumbs to its blockbuster ambitions and turns into a noisy, bloated mess.",
    "Scarcely seems worth the expenditure of time, money and talent.",
    "This clunky TV remake is stiffer than an iron curtain.",
    "A whole lot of something about nothing."

The human casting was sheer brilliance, especially Robert De NIro as Fearless Leader. After seeing him in so many mob-related films, it was a refreshing change to see him basically making fun of himself. Piper Perabo was awesome in here. Rene Russo and Jason Alexander were absolutely hilarious as Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale. I also enjoyed the wall-to-wall celebrity cameos such as John Goodman, Carl Reiner, Billy Crystal, and Whoopi Goldberg to name a few. Yes, some of the puns are dry. But, I found most of them to be absolutely hilarious. If I have one complaint about this film, it would be that it's no where near long enough. Otherwise, this is a great movie for the entire family.",
