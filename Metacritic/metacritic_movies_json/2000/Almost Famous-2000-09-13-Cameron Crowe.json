  "summary": "In the 1970's, a high school boy (Fugit) is given an opportunity to follow and write a story about the hot new rock band Stillwater (with lead guitarist  Crudup) as they tour the USA.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "A wondrous honesty.",
    "See it and it'll stay with you as your own memories do: funny, poignant, bittersweet and irreplaceable.",
    "It's not only the most gentle and effortlessly funny movie so far this year, it's a film with a style and sensibility that wonderfully harkens back to Hollywood's golden age of sophisticated comedy, and in particular to the masterpieces of Crowe's filmmaking idol, Billy Wilder.",
    "A great movie -- and the best movie ever about the '70s rock era.",
    "Oh, what a lovely film. I was almost hugging myself while I watched it.",
    "You'll treasure this movie.",
    "What Mr. Crowe has done is nonetheless remarkable. He has made a movie about sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll that you would be happy to take your mother to see.",
    "Crowe, staying close to his memories, has gotten it, for perhaps the first time, onto the screen.",
    "The first relevant film about rock and roll and the music industry, the first film that lets you in on the secret.",
    "Casting is perfect all down the line.",
    "Sharply observed, bittersweet and suffused with the kind of detail that only someone who lived through the era could summon up, Crowe's script is funny, heartfelt and very cool.",
    "Crowe's world is an open ecosystem --transcendentally open. This movie is his boombox held aloft.",
    "Crowe has made a hugely entertaining, nearly pitch-perfect film about rock & roll.",
    "It takes the rock movie into regions it has never been before.",
    "Crowe has created a genuine love song for all those who've ever felt their lives to have been saved by rock & roll.",
    "Crowe gave Kate Hudson one pointer while making Almost Famous: Her character simply had to light up every room as soon as she walked into it.",
    "A movie that is easily likable.",
    "More gentle and modestly insightful than it is exhilarating or revelatory.",
    "Panoramic yet cozy, enthusiastically glib.",
    "Like rock 'n' roll itself, the movie's really all about girls. Even when -- no, especially when -- it's pretending not to be.",
    "This is wonderful stuff, as far as it goes.",
    "This has much of the warmth and feeling for adolescence that Crowe displayed in his first feature (\"Say Anything\"), though the slick showboating of \"Jerry Maguire\" isn't entirely absent either.",
    "Fugit gives a starmaking performance as the teenage reporter, and Crudup and Lee are excellent as the band's lead guitarist and singer, respectively.",
    "A sweet but curiously unfulfilling story."

I love movies, I love classic rock, I, like the protagonist, discovered rock at a young age. However, the film is one word: BLAND. And bland is most certainly not a word you would associate with coming of age and the power of rock and roll. It's based on Crowe's own experiences, but it makes you wonder: Did he water it down or was it all really this uneventful? The performances by Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, and Jason Lee are very solid, while the usually great Frances McDormand was handed an underwritten character. Kate Hudson, meanwhile, plays \"band aid\" Penny Lane in a lifeless, generic fashion that makes it unlikely anyone would fall for her, and that she would have an interest in anything, let alone rock and roll. The film lopes along and never gains momentum, and leaves you with a flat feeling. If you want the real spirit of rock music, watch A Hard Day's Night, School of Rock, American Graffiti, and Dazed and Confused, and forget Almost Famous.",

To be given the chance to step into their world within having too much irrepairable damage inflicted must have been amazing-if Cameron Crowe really did experiance this, he must regret the passing of time.

Well written and acted with many both funny and heart warming moments. I would say that the one weak link in this movie is Patrick Fugit which proves to be problematic at times because he is in most every scene. There a couple scenes in particular with Hudson where Fugit fails to hold his own against her or the dialogue, and this took me out of the movie for a moment or two. These moments are few and far between however and most of this movie is entertaining. Hoffman in particular is extraordinary as usual. While this movie did nothing to hook me emotionally, it also did nothing to disappoint. An entertaining film worth a few viewings.",

All of their characters areAlmost Famous is absolutely a very good film that I really enjoyed thoroughly. First off, the acting is great. Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson, Jason Lee, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, are all stupendous. All of their characters are endearing in their own way and really steal the spotlight individually at times. The directing from Cameron Crowe is great and the story is told wonderfully. It really does not glamorize rock and roll of the time, but it certainly makes you fall in love with these flawed human beings as we interact with them through the eyes of a young 15 year old writer. We truly fall in love with these people as he does and struggle through the same struggles he does as a writer on this trip that changes his life forever. Ultimately, Almost Famous is a resounding success and a film that provides laughs, drama, and just enough of romance, to keep you interested. A truly great film.",

The message and themes shine bright, and every character is there for a reason. Some scenes drag a little bit too long and are overplayed a little bit, which is the sole reason for my 8 and not 10 rating. But, still overall a great film and I definitely recommend it. I especially liked Eric Stonestreet as Sheldon the desk clerk, after seeing him in ModFam.",

Everything about this movie is perfect. Cameron Crowe really captured something that he was passionate about. Almost Famous is essentially Crowe's life as a teenager while he was writing for Rolling Stone, he lived this movie. I love Billy Crudup as Russell Hammond, who is one of the coolest characters ever portrayed on screen if you ask me. Jason Lee was also great as the lead singer, I really love everything Lee does and I will he'd get some more recognition for how great he is, but Kate Hudson is who really steals the show. Hudson has the performance of a lifetime in this movie as Penny Lane and you are drawn to her whenever she is on the screen. Almost Famous captures a point in time that will never grow old, this film will always be amazing and I recommend it to anyone, old or young. Almost Famous belongs in my stack of perfect films.",

As much as unique the concept is, it equally is simple and sensible that breeds valuable opinions from each three dimensional characters of it. Crowe's world in here believes to live in present and enjoy each tiny moments which offers the audience an adequate soothing closure in each frame; it's just a \"good\" story is what it is. Even the weaving of the structure that occurs in front of the audience in its initial stages, is breathtaking with monologues, debates and \"teenage fun\" bits that makes it slick. The songs are uplifting, the backyard score is decently scored, the cinematography is mesmerizing with fine editing and stunning camera work and visuals with live locations that foliates it into the anticipated musical cinematic experience. Hudson is surprisingly good with Crudup and Lane going head to head offering the appropriate crisp to their track and McDormand as always offering the gravitas and keeps this fairy tale grounded. Crowe's narration is far better than we usually get in such band musicals and the primary reason to that is that it is perfectly balanced, it never is too light nor dark, he is well aware of his audience and he can filter them out with maturity itself. His execution is definitely worth the script he wrote, in fact if anything it celebrates it with an extravaganza for life where each emotional conflict is respected equally with a subtle tone. The behind the stage preparations and conversations that a star goes through, the originality and innocence of the concept and Crowe oozing his presence behind all of it are the high points of the feature. Almost Famous is pure art that both lyrically rhymes and taps to the beat and eventually make you too.",
