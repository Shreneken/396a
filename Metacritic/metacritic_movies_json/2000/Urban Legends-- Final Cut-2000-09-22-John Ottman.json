  "critic_reviews": [
    "You're smarter than this, but occasionally it tricks you into thinking it might be up to something you haven't considered, like an above-average, extra-bloody episode of \"Scooby Doo.\"",
    "Has slick production credits and performances that are quite adequate given the (narrow) opportunities of the genre.",
    "Has a dark, low-budget feel and an incongruous combination of self-consciously jokey patter and gross-out gore.",
    "Schlock, but amusing schlock.",
    "Awful in ways that are just clever enough often enough to make it intermittently watchable.",
    "Although it's recycled from start to finish, there are some decent jokes laced throughout, plus enough gore to satisfy the most bloodthirsty tastes.",
    "You cease to care as they fall back on a catalogue of clichéd shocks, tired camera angles and an ever-mounting gore quotient.",
    "Preposterous plotting and interchangeable young actors.",
    "Sophomoric.",
    "Ottman doesn't have the firm grasp of tone necessary to make his deliberate ambiguities seem other than simple confusion, nor the sense of humor necessary to turn the deliberate clichés into effective satire.",
    "Wears its lack of originality in a crowded slasher marketplace like a red badge of desperation.",
    "Simply a lousy film from start to finish.",
    "Basically a dressed-up piece of drivel, a self-referential pseudo-thriller with pretensions to pretensions of classic Hollywood suspense.",
    "Doesn't do much with its pseudosavvy characters.",
    "Predictable, gratuitous and just self-referential enough to believe itself hip and knowing.",
    "Has promising raw material to burn--and that's pretty much what's been done.",
    "Simply less campily moronic than its predecessor, a tired kill-by-numbers.",
    "Just plain bad.",
    "It's hard not to feel angry that you've spent almost two hours watching this moronic exercise.",
    "A poorer film than the paltry original even as it strikes a self-consciously clever pose.",
    "The only quandary in this film is in where to begin despising it.",
    "If you've seen one \"Scream\" rip-off, you really have seen them all.",
    "As for genuine willies, well, chances are you've had more disturbing encounters with, say, a belligerent Shih Tzu.",
    "No style, no irony and no smarts, just a vicious streak that lasts 90 minutes.",
    "Debased swill."

The acting was average at best, the twin aspect of the movie is silly and completely unnecessary, the movie tries so hard to establish one of the characters as the obvious killer, that it's obviously not him and the characters were so stupid that it became infuriating. At least the movie as a whole was quite entertaining.",

The answer is no.In this film, Amy Mayfield, a young film student, has to make a short film as an end-of-course work. She decides to make a film in which a murderer kills his victims by recreating famous urban legends. Everything is going well until people really start to die, at the hands of a mysterious murderer.Well, what we have here is the same recipe used in the first film. The difference is that, as we have already seen it, it does not surprise us. It's just another horror movie for teenagers, with a plot so weak that it's not even worth talking about it. It will shatter at the first pull as if it were a rotten rag. The cast is very weak, almost amateur. Jennifer Morrison, the lead actress, does nothing particularly good. She just does what has to be done. There are, however, some moments where it seems that the film makes some little veiled criticisms, but quickly leaves that aside. The ending is perhaps the best part of the film.Despite being, in general, a frankly bad and forgettable film, it was a step forward in the career of many of those involved. Actresses like Eva Mendes, Matthew Davis or Jennifer Morrison had, shortly after, the opportunity to do more serious work: Mendes, for example, will have the opportunity to appear in \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\" and Davis will cost to establish himself but, after years of small appearances, he will finally did it with \"Vampire Diaries\". Even the director, John Ottman, will discover that he is a terrible director but has a knack for other things in cinema, as music. So, I think this film fulfilled an objective and served a purpose, although perhaps many of those involved hide it on the bottom shelf of their filmography.",
