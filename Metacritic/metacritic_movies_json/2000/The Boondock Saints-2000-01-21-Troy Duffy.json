    "summary": "Two Catholic vigilante killers from Boston (Flannery, Reedus) who believe they are doing God's work kill members of the Russian mob and customers of a porn shop, but instead of paying for their crimes, they are praised as \"saints\" by the local newspaper and by an odd FBI agent (Dafoe).",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "(Duffy) navigates the twisted collision of religious faith and the thrill of the kill, altruism and brutality, with an ingenious mix of humor, horror, mysticism, and just plain hipness.",
        "More interested in finding fresh ways to stage execution scenes than in finding meaning behind the human urge for self-appointed righting of wrongs, (the film) is stuffed with effects that have no lasting impact.",
        "(Duffy's) assembled a fine cast -- it's hard to take your eyes off the two young leads -- but he's given them little to do but squeeze triggers and mouth platitudes.",
        "As written and directed by newcomer Troy Duffy, The Boondock Saints is all style and no substance, a film so gleeful in its endorsement of vigilante justice that it almost veers (or ascends) into self-parody."

The pseudo religious undercurrents are on par with those in Arnolds end of days if not worse...... just cus they pray after they kill in no way illustrates how these tards are supposed to be acting out of faith or how their faith justifies the killing. How is it that in this day and age people still sympathize with characters, and yes we ARE supposed to sympathize with this duo of beer guzzling Irish vigilantes, that take justice in their own hands in the name of religion, all the while suicide bombers kill for the exact same reason????? Maybe it's because the characters in the movies are killing in the name of the RIGHT god and not for a dangerous foreign one. The unforgivable stupidity of the movie aside; there is not an original idea in the direction and despite Defoes, admittedly funny, depiction of a gay bashing homosexual cop, the acting is just plain bad........ I'm sorry, but this is a horrendous movie.",

I loved this movie and think that it at minimum shows the moral standard that people SHOULD live by. Is violence wrong? Yes it is. Is violence sometimes necessary?

The two leads were quite charismatic, but they didn't have enough screen time, most of the movie having been taken over by stupid dialogue between Dafoe in his worst performance ever and the rest of the police department. Please, enough with the bagel jokes! They weren't funny the first time, let alone the tenth! Dafoe's character is just as waffling as the rest of the movie: the character alternates between being a genius if eccentric detective and a loser who is just as confused as the rest of his bumbling police force.

But the saddest part was that lack of quality that went with it. I would find a more quality series of events in a Punisher comic book. -2 Lack of theme-Though the statement they make makes you relate, it carries hardly any philosophical value. They could have easily surrounded the story with ideas on justice or some other often questioned value.-3 The smut- The language is horrendous, and the jokes mostly were vary perverted. Though quite funny in an immature way, I personally would rather watch some quality jokes. Not Youtube.

Yes, it rips off both Pulp Fiction and Leon in places (I cringed at the 'No women, no children' philosophy of Billy C's character), but, in my humble opinion, this film beats Pulp Fiction. It's funnier, but in a way that seems coincidental rather than deliberate (the scene where the brothers play a trick on Rocco is superb), and the toilet- dropping scene near the beggining is breathtaking.

I personally enjoyed this movie very much but I have seen much better attempts at this style movie, specifically by Tarantino. It seems to me that Duffy idolizes Tarantino and at times Duffy succeeds in bringing that sick and surreal wit to the screen, however most of the time he fails. You may enjoy this movie if you love gangster movies and their kin or simply love violence. If you absolutely abhor movies that lack any real insight or explorations of the issues raised and leave all analysis to the viewer, then you are a mindless automaton and will definitely hate this movie.",

The script seems as if it was writen by a high school student, then acted out word for word by novice actors looking for a shot at the big time. Willem Dafoe overacts as usual, playing a gay detective that exemplifies the homosexual stereotype as a completely flaming man. He dances around while investigating crime seens in an almost unbearable seen while sweat drips down his head. Every background actor gives off an amature aura as if they were plucked from the street to play the roll. The only respectable acting jobs done are by the two brothers and Rocco. The movie makes use of ridiculous stunts that mimic James Bond movies (ie. jumping off a 5 story building) however this can be overlooked because it is a cheesy B movie. On the otherhand, scenes where the \"best assasin in the world\" stands 10 yards away from the 3 main characters, unloads six handguns worth of bullets and only hits one of their hands make you question, how retarded can this get before I turn it off? If the best assasin can't take out three schmucks, then I'm James Bond. The story evolves basically because the three brothers get into a bar fight, then realize they enjoy kicking ass. So they go kick some more ass, then some more, then some more. The humor isn't funny, the action is mediocre and the acting is amateur.

It's eccentric characters lead to a lot of memorable moments. The action is also well-crafted, but the film regularly gets distracted with side-excursions into juvenile and crass comedic material. There are so many moments that don't contribute anything to the overall plot, but are made entertaining by just how odd they are. Occasionally they can be tasteless, such as a scene where one of the side-characters is forced to tell a racist joke to his crime boss. We're supposed to laugh at just how uncomfortable and floundering the character is when having to try to make his serious and dangerous employer laugh, but the only amusement I got was from the fact that it was included in the first place.When the movie is focusing on the crime-scene investigations and flashbacks to actual hits on the mob bosses, you can tell it's a pretty well put together little film and certainly a unique one at that. Willem Dafoe's performance in endlessly enjoyable. His dialog is hilarious (mostly because of his delivery) and I was shocked to see just how far both he and the movie were willing to go in some cases. It's a pretty crazy experience right from the start, but blows up into an all out circus in it's final act. It's also worth noting that Norman Reedus would regularly slip in and out of his Irish accent throughout.Those hoping for a thoughtful look at the moral ambiguity of an \"eye for an eye\" mindset will be disappointed. What few questions it does raise in regards to the validity of answering violent crime with just as violent justice are reserved for the very end of the movie and aren't explored at all. It's easy to tell where writer and director Troy Duffy stands on the matter though. No, The Boondock Saints is much more concerned with brutal wish fulfillment and immature humor. It values blood and bullets more than a brain.I can't say I liked this movie or that it's even particularly good film, but there was never a dull moment. This strange tale about two very Irish brothers who have a spiritual experience that tells them to go out and kill all those criminals who seem to regularly slip through the cracks in the justice system is one brimming with personality. So much so in fact, that it gets in it's own way by trying to do it's own thing far too often and branches out in directions that feel pointless and unnecessary. The Boondock Saints is not going to click with everyone. A lot of us will be better off just sticking with The Punisher for our vigilante needs. However those who value originality no matter how peculiar might find a hidden gem with this one.",

Mixing some of the brotherly antics with the family ties and the drama and love between the three characters makes some of these scenes unforgettable. The characters are almost needlessly in depth going so far as to delve into their personal sex lives. Looking into the characters' motives and reasons for killing reminds me of what comes out of the Middle East extremist groups, yet in a much more calm and controlled sense, if you can even say that about killing in the name of an omnipresent leader. If you've seen it and all you want to do is sit there and say it's a ripoff of all these other films then fine, but if you haven't seen this movie I encourage you to rent it or Netflix it or do whatever you have to do, as this is a film that many can enjoy.",

This movie never gets boring, this movie surprises the viewer every minute. The characters get well established, are easy to know, like and relate to. When watchng \"The Boondock Saints\" I felt as I was killin the baddies myself. Few scenes made me laugh a lot, as the Saints are quite the company of very different people on multiple levels. All of this acompanied by a detective who is starting to have doubts about his job. To be honest I took this film more as comedy than drama or anything serious. It gets brutal at times, but the funny stuff enters it the same moments. Light, funny, especially worth seeing for the characters development part.",

You get the MacManus brothers on their crusade for justice, which is fine. It's nothing particularly new. The violence is loud, brash, and impersonal. The religious undertones are tried and only semi-true. But -- oh, man -- does Willem Dafoe bring it in this movie as the FBI agent pursuing the brothers' controversial plight. He simply acts circles around every other performer in this movie and it doesn't even stop there -- the dialogue and scene dynamics almost instantaneously improve every time he's onscreen.

I'm most definitely among the lovers out there and the reason for this is simple : out of all action films I've ever seen, \"The Boondock Saints\" seemed the most entertaining, the most visually appealing, the most original and the funniest to me.\r Sure, \"The Boondock Saints\" is no \"Citizen Kane\", but that's something I never expected in the first place. There are some major plot holes, most characters are caricatures and the acting isn't the best around, but if you manage to ignore this there is a lot to like about this film.\r Being raised in a Flemish labor class family, my cultural background is very much like that of the two main characters. As such, I found the motivations, the philosophy, the personalities and humor of the main characters very recognizable and very appealing. I suspect this may also be a major reason why there are so many haters. If you do not have any affinity with Irish labor class culture or mentality, then you may just not \"get it\". I'm not saying you must be a factory worker to like this film, though. My own job is programming web applications.\r Then there's the visuals. Duffy opted for a non-linear way of telling his story that with a unique combination of fast-paced action, some experimental editing and a matching music score. While \"Pulp Fiction\" undoubtedly inspired Duffy's style, it's still far too different from Tarantino's typical style or anything else I've ever seen to be considered a rip-off. Tarantino based his own style on the dozens of films from the '70s he saw as a teenager, but does that make \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"Pulp Fiction\" any less original or unique?\r Most of all, though, \"The Boondock Saints\" is just fun. Invite some of your friends over, grab a few beers and just enjoy the fact-paced action, the sometimes very foul-mouthed or very dark humor and debate with your friends whether you'd think it would be a blessing or a curse if \"The Boondock Saints\" were actually real and not just a story made up by Duffy. For me, that's the perfect setting for a film like this.",
