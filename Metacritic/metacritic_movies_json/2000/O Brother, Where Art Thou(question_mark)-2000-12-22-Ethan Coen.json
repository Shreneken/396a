    "critic_reviews": [
        "It's a wild, whacked-out wonder.  Coenheads rejoice.",
        "A wildly original movie with astonishingly varied moods and influences.",
        "From moment to moment, O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a pleasure. But when the Coens are really cooking, when the acting and the conception and the music all come together, it's something more -- Dogpatch rapture.",
        "It's a new new thing, classic myth from both literature and the movies, commingled, set to great folk music, and untrammeled by any sense of predictability, urgency, realism or believability but hypnotic, graceful and seductive.",
        "It is, all in all, a rambunctious and inspired ride in which the Coen brothers' voracious fascination with the arcana of American popular culture and their whiz-kid inventiveness reach new heights of whimsy.",
        "Clooney has become a movie star, and the Coens have given him his very own \"It Happened One Night.\" The man, and the movie, are downright bona fide.",
        "Devilishly delightful.",
        "Enlivening things to an unprecedented extent, the songs turn O Brother into perhaps the warmest production in the Coens' repertoire.",
        "All I can say is this particular excursion into screwball madness is often heavenly, and frankly leaves critical explication somewhat unnecessary. Go see it and laugh.",
        "As a Coen brothers fan I hate to say this, but the movie's a collection of great bits and pieces rather than a complete work.",
        "The risk pays off for Clooney and the Coens, as O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a nicely off-kilter exploration of American gumption.",
        "This time around, though, the Coens' usual arch deliberateness isn't quite as deliberate, and there's an appealing shagginess to some of the episodes and performances.... This is the Coen brothers' most emotionally felt movie, and that's not meant as faint praise.",
        "Toss in enough gorgeous bluegrass music to make the movie's CD a must-have, and you have prime, picaresque entertainment.",
        "A charming, if lightweight, Coen brothers escapade flecked by plenty of visual and performance grace notes.",
        "A remarkable film. From its performances on down to director of photography Roger Deakins' sun-baked, dirty-ochre cinematography, the film is all of a piece.",
        "Joyously unhinged and outrageously inventive.",
        "The film is worth seeing for George Clooney's performance. More than ever he seems like a Clark Gable for our time.",
        "A clever and satisfyingly abundant entertainment.",
        "For all its originality, O Brother doesn't seem to have a point, or enough spark to distract us from the lack thereof.",
        "Of all unlikely possibilities, the team has finally made a movie that, for them, is on the tepid side.",
        "While it displays its share of quirky charm, off-kilter characters and outlandish situations, this is really the first film where you can feel the Coens straining to keep up with themselves.",
        "Not quite as funny as it wants to be. Mostly, it's just silly. But as always, the Coens are entertaining themselves first.and their quirky individuality has served them and their fans well so far.",
        "O Brother contains sequences that are wonderful in themselves--lovely short films--but the movie never really shapes itself into a whole.",
        "The art direction is impeccable, but this is a pop-up book that I was impatient to slam.",
        "Often clever but fundamentally shallow, this shaggy-dog story is greatly enriched by its extraordinary bluegrass soundtrack, supervised by T Bone Burnett and performed by a phenomenal collection of artists.",
        "For all its ambitions, though, the Coens' odyssey is a scattershot affair with too many tricks and twists for its own good.",
        "Remains naggingly hollow, a cerebral exercise in whimsy that isn't nearly clever or funny enough to seem like more than grand self-indulgence.",
        "After making their two best features to date, \"Fargo\" and \"The Big Lebowski,\" the Coen brothers have surely come up with their worst.",
        "Whenever the music subsides and the characters speak the Coens' lines, the film turns back into mush.",
        "Why would filmmakers with this much talent work this hard to thumb their noses at everything they put on screen?"

Structurally, it is a 'road movie', though it borrows the episodic encounters with larger-than-life characters from Homer's Odyssey (including sirens and a cyclops!). But the artful combination of its photography and music with delightful story and characters makes this one of most bewitching and beautiful road movies ever made.The critics seem to find it shallow, though I struggle to understand why. In addition to being genuinely funny and centred upon rich characters, the story includes a fair weight of political satire and a sprinkling of the Coens' strange metaphysical fascinations, with the Devil making his own cameo in the form of a lawman. If this is too shallow, I wonder what comedies the critics have been watching that are so deep?If people are confusing depth for emotionalism, perhaps they should stick to rewatching the English Patient.",

One may find the wanton slaughter of cows, superficially sexualized Sirens, satanic black side kick, mocked/idealized villains, commercial contemporary take on folk music, incidental ties to Greek tragedy, and general aimlessness (tied together with a cute little literal string) to be light-hearted fun, but to see it as repugnant is an equally appropriate reaction. This is a story of selfishness and stupidity signifying nothing. The characters live in a beautiful world and have zero appreciation for it. This is exemplified by the slick, soulless direction and obvious, ugly digitized cinematography. \"O Brother\" can be called nihilistic and smug with perfect reason because, for all it creativity and polish, it is an intentionally aloft meditation on negativity and cynicism. At least \"Days of Heaven\" seems to have some sense of appreciation for atmosphere and environment even as it utilizes Depression era elements. Nihilism can be overtly expressed or implied, and \"O Brother\" wears it less like a badge than like a favorite pair of dirty socks kept in some high drawer, right next to a baby skull paper weight for a pornographic magazine. Sometimes laughter is a sign of sickness. JAFO (just another ****ing opinion) for what it is worth. Cheers.",

Suave and fancy-talking Everett Ulysses McGill The writing, directing, and producing team of Joel Coen and Ethan Coen created this picaresque comedy (inspired in part by Homer's The Odyssey) set in the Deep South during the Depression. Suave and fancy-talking Everett Ulysses McGill (George Clooney), dim-witted Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson), and easily-excitable Pete (John Turturro) are serving time together on a prison chain gang. Everett knows where $1.2 million is hidden that's theirs for the taking, and the three manage to escape; however, a stranger soon warns them that they'll find treasure, but not the sort they're looking for. As Everett and his partners hit the road, they happen upon a gluttonous bible salesman, Big Dan Teague (John Goodman); meet up with Baby Face Nelson (Michael Badalucco) as he robs a bank; encounter three Sirens doing their washing; run into Everett's estranged wife Penny (Holly Hunter), who has told everyone her husband was killed in a train wreck; find themselves in the middle of a heated campaign between political boss Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning), and reformist candidate Homer Stokes (Wayne Duvall); and even find time to make a hit record as The Soggy Bottom Boys. Noted songwriter T-Bone Burnett helped compile the songs (combining vintage country blues tunes with originals in the same style), while Carter Burwell composed the background score. Incidentally, the title O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a reference to the classic Preston Sturges comedy Sullivan's Travels, in which a director plans to make a serious \"message picture\" with that name. O Brother, Where Art Thou? is the number one motion picture of the year, and has all the hip and jazz to almost reach the standards of The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly.",

The comic tone in here works which doesn't always come in handy, especially when there isn't much room for it. Having said that, the feature never attains the correct amount of intensity that it anticipated for and the primary reason is the stake projected in here that never reaches to the audience.It is short on technical aspects like background score, sound effects and editing, although the costume design is suitable with the tone of the feature. The feature doesn't follow a rudimentary process which favors in its side along with its light and breezy tone which it stays true to, throughout the course of it. The screenplay by Coen brothers may not be smart but is surely gripping and hilarious in its own terms. Addition to that, Joel Coen; the director, has done a tremendous job on executing the feature despite of fumbling its way on the dramatic aspects of it. The performance objective is handled decently by the protagonist George Clooney where he is supported by John Goodman and Holly Hunter.O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a confused feature seeking and bearing for art that it never is able to reach for let along grasp it.",

Even if his effort wasn't positive he tried. I say that because I read Homer and I know how heavy this author can be. Its a kind of literature extremely difficult to adapt. The Coen Brother's went a step further: they took Homer to the cinema in a way that hardly resembles Homer. They put old Greek story into a new context, giving it a different shape. All done with the usual touch of sarcastic elegance that is the signature of these directors.The plot's main idea is simple but takes time to show itself: Everett Ulysses McGill is a convict who decides to flee his labor camp and try to prevent his fianc\u00e9 from marrying another man. He takes two other prisoners who were fortunately chained together with him. Some moments of the film are very funny and the irony is always there. Sometimes we wonder where are the logic but the film quickly explains most of the illogical moments (except, perhaps, the hundreds of pomade cans that appear throughout the film, which I honestly don't quite understand). In contrary to some critics, I don't think reading \"Odyssey\" is important to understand this movie, although it helps us to notice some nebulous scenes. The work of the actors is well done but no actor overlaps George Clooney, almost unrecognizable, with an intense southern accent. Well, maybe Tim Blake Nelson is as good as Clooney, thanks to the naive way he played Delmar. Finally, a word of appreciation for the costumes and scenarios, absolutely faithful to the period in which everything happens, as well as the enveloping and animated soundtrack, that gives life to the story.",

The songs are all so gorgeous, beautifully sung and so evocative, conjuring up a completely different ideal of a lost world in the past that never really existed in the storybook way it appears here.  Don't get me wrong, the movie is good too, but the soundtrack will definitely get more replay value with me than the movie will--it's the most exceptional and beautiful part of the film.",
