  "summary": "A University Professor (Jackson) becomes the love interest of Klump (Murphy).  Her research is helpful to Klump when his alter ego Buddy Love threatens their romance.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Eight different characters, all played by Murphy, all convincing, each with its own personality. This is not just a stunt. It is some kind of brilliance.",
    "It's a half-life better than Martin Lawrence treading similar, simpler water in \"Big Momma's House.\"",
    "Frequently hilarious.",
    "When have we seen the same performer playing both parts in a sexual situation? It happens here, not once but twice.",
    "Murphy still knows how to please a crowd.",
    "Nothing less than stunning: a slapstick ballet of choreographed buffoonery.",
    "Messy and scattershot, with a plot that's little more than a dirty version of ''Flubber.''",
    "Despite greater resources and high-tech whiz bang than the first movie, has a lot more turkey than dinner.",
    "This is a parlor trick, but it's a hell of a good one.",
    "Too often, the movie is more forced and frantic than actually funny.",
    "Murphy is remarkably convincing -- even endearing -- as each of the characters.",
    "It's just like Paul McCartney's first solo album after the Beatles broke up; he played all the instruments himself -- because he could.",
    "Half a movie at best. The broad humor at times derails Mr. Murphy's performances, but the movie provides a vehicle for him to display his reach.",
    "There's a whole lotta latex goin' on. The trouble is that not enough else is going on.",
    "Character-rich, but plot-poor.",
    "Has some very funny moments, it is weighed down by gooey sentimentality.",
    "The bloom is off the rose due to cynical rehash.",
    "Yes, bestiality in a PG-13 movie. It's the end of life as we know it.",
    "Defiantly sophomoric, often hilarious and crude as all get-out.",
    "This inferior sequel is doomed by a lousy - and extremely vulgar - script.",
    "He (Murphy) can't make chicken a la king from the chicken manure supplied by the writers.",
    "Sporadically funny, the film seems weighted down, literally, with bulging, bulbous Murphys flatulating endlessly.",
    "An amazing technical accomplishment that never becomes a coherent movie.",
    "Be prepared to laugh less at a lot more of the same thing in this overbearing but underwhelming sequel.",
    "Half vulgar and funny, half tedious and cloying; despite the shameless laughs, it's still a disappointment.",
    "An annoying, unclever, unlikable movie.",
    "The star's over-the-top energy isn't enough to make this hopelessly vulgar, numbingly repetitious farce worth watching.",
    "Wastes most of its 110 minutes making impotent jokes about male sexual behavior and the repugnance of old women.",
    "What was a ragged but often hilarious charmer has been genetically altered into a deafening and desperate mutant.",
    "Suffers from a serious case of sophomore slump.",
    "It will linger like a foul odor or the taste of tinfoil between the teeth.",
    "The thrill is definitely gone, leaving a disappointing and unpleasant mess in its place.",
    "Utterly unnecessary sequel."

Eddie Murphy is a good actor but compared to the original it's rubbish because The Nutty Professor is an excellent film and it's pretty funny. Nutty Professor II was just awful in every way and some sequels work like Terminator 2, Aliens, Lethal Weapon 2, French Connection II which was an excellent film but Nutty Professor II doesn't work and for a sequel it's pretty bad. Skip this junk.",

It's probably on par with the first film with just as many jokes, and I loved having more of the Klumps on screen, but that 'dinner scene' has lost its effect from the first film. Janet replaces Jada and she fits in well with the film. There is a nice blend of comedy mixed with good messages but overall its a great comedy and again Eddie's best work in my opinion.",
