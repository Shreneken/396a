  "critic_reviews": [
    "It's that very rare feeling that you're settling into a movie whose individual elements are so finely attuned they fuse into a singular construct of pure entertainment.",
    "A gloriously entertaining thrill-packer of truly epic proportions.",
    "There's a thrilling sense of transcendence that won't let go from the first masterfully constructed frames in Ridley Scott's modern epic of ancient Rome. It's that very rare feeling that you're settling into a movie whose individual elements are so finely attuned they fuse into a singular construct of pure entertainment.",
    "What matters for today's hero is the good fight, and Gladiator KOs us with a doozy.",
    "It lives up to the hype. Gladiator has its creaky moments, but it delivers a particular kind of visceral historical spectacle that movie audiences haven't seen in decades.",
    "An exhilarating, sweeping epic that begs to be seen on the largest possible screen.",
    "If there's a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&-sandal epic -- and from the star rating above, I think you can guess where I stand -- then you'll swoon with giddy delight over Gladiator.",
    "Has the kind of super-cinematic qualities and bravura acting that make up for almost anything.",
    "Gladiator is designed not just to entertain, but to enthrall. It draws audiences in and immerses them in a reality that is not their own. A boisterous reaction is expected every time the protagonist defies the odds and wins a conflict, or changes the tide of battle in his favor. This is filmmaking on a grand scale.",
    "One extended guilty pleasure.",
    "John Mathieson's widescreen cinematography is magnificent, and the pacing across 2½ hours is well modulated.",
    "Emphasizing brawn over brain and spectacle over intimacy, Ridley Scott's Gladiator nevertheless is an impressive accomplishment in its re-creation not only of the golden age of the Roman Empire but of the unspeakable brutality with which one of the world's greatest states conducted its business.",
    "Scott's sword and sandal spectacular is a bloody good yarn, packed with epic pomp and pageantry, dastardly plots, massed action and forthright, fundamental emotions.",
    "The whole enterprise rests on Mr. Crowe's armor-clad shoulders, and he carries it remarkably well.",
    "While it's all grand opera, and driven by sweeping gestures and pompous, overwritten dialogue, it is prone to plain silliness - especially in granting us the big showdown at the close. But the sheer dynamism of the action, coupled with Hans Zimmer's lavish score and the forcefield of Crowe, still makes this a fiercesome competitor in the summer movie stakes.",
    "As formulaic, but occasionally outré multiplex-bound behemoths go, Gladiator is a foaming beast.",
    "At 2 1/2 hours, Gladiator is a long ride, but it doesn't drag.",
    "In the end, Gladiator is overdrawn and too insubstantial for its own good, just like the old days, but it satisfies as entertainment on a grand scale.",
    "The upside? Visually polished, credibly acted and competently directed courtesy of Ridley Scott, the film is always likable. The downside? Well, it's never anything more than likable.",
    "The heroism and the tigers and the epic grandeur all leave behind the flavor of cynicism.",
    "Brawny, he-man spectacle combined with a surprisingly solid story and buttressed by excellent performances.",
    "The warm humanizing element in all the cool stuff is Crowe.",
    "Instead of the heat of humanity, what lingers on in the mind is the cool of the computerized effects.",
    "It ends with the corniest convention of all: an absurd mano-a-mano between good and evil.",
    "The script by producer David Franzoni, John Logan, and William Nicholson is serviceable but not exactly inspired.",
    "Filled with brilliant filmmaking and features outstanding performances, but it's neither profound enough nor pop enough to be great -- it's mournful, serious, beautiful and, finally, pointless.",
    "Like an aging athlete who knows how to husband strength and camouflage weaknesses, it makes the most of what it does well and hopes you won't notice its limitations.",
    "Grandiose and silly.",
    "The digital animation is far more evident here than in \"The Phantom Menace.\"",
    "It's a loud, obnoxious, and pleasant-enough entertainment, but hardly the soaring tale of one man's struggle that it was so clearly envisioned to be.",
    "The soul of Gladiator is made sluggish by a maddening lack of suspense.",
    "Scott's filmmaking is as blunt and bullying as the mayhem it portrays.",
    "It employs depression as a substitute for personality, and believes that if the characters are bitter and morose enough, we won't notice how dull they are.",
    "For all its grandeur, Gladiator is a canned experience, a film that flails around awkwardly trying to find a reason to exist, or at least a compelling story to tell.",
    "Gladiator's combination of grim sanctimony and drenching, Dolby-ized dismemberings left me appalled.",
    "Friends, Washingtonians, countrymen, I come not to praise Gladiator but to bury it."

Both Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are incredibly brilliant in their respective roles, however Phoenix deserves tons of props for pulling off a convincing evil emporer. Connie Nielsen almost steals the show at times while playing Lucille (Commodus' sister).

Ie: \"Gladiator\" is not merely a collection of fighting at the Coliseum in Rome, more or less of spectacular via special effects. And what is it? A real tragedy of inner power, underpinned by a subtle and intelligent argument that favors relations backstage and shades of political discourse. Gladiator is a true intimate epic, served by some remarkable compositions of his cast, especially almost inevitable for Joaquin Phoenix, impeccable characterization of a tissue power of ambition, blindness and fear. Ultimately, we are faced with a symphonic work whose themes and variations are wonderfully scored music by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard.

His son however has other ideas. Angered by what he feels is a betrayal he sets about exerting his murderous authority and Maximus, having refused to swear his loyalty, only narrowly escapes with his life. Bent on vengeance Maximus later returns to Rome as a gladiator hoping to take down the new emperor.\r Aside from a few plot holes Gladiator is peerless in its quality. Russell Crowe, always an excellent actor, plays his defining role, his presence commanding attention throughout the film and the supporting cast do well not to be completely overshadowed by his performance. The action sequences are brilliantly shot and staggering in their realism as all the gory details are shown. As the film reaches its climax this all combines to make it impossible to not root for Maximus in what is arguably the movie of the decade.",

The arrogant and unbalanced Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) arrives at the front, along with his beautiful older sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), just in time to learn that his ailing father (Richard Harris) has named the triumphant Maximus his successor as emperor. For his part, Maximus, a Spaniard who has never seen Rome and, far more important, has been separated from his wife and son for nearly three years, wants no part of this plan.But Maximus makes the mistake of spurning Commodus. After killing his father in a fit of jealous spite, the insecure new emperor orders the execution of the popular general. The resourceful Maximus escapes this fate but reaches home too late; when he arrives, he finds his wife and son dead, his farm torched. In the poetic manner of Sergio Leone, Scott uses a man of action’s bitter and idealized memory of his lost family as a motif and a motive for the single-minded pursuit to which he devotes the remainder of his life.\r At the 45-minute mark, action shifts to a distant North African outpost of the empire, where the captive Maximus is taken as slave. Purchased by gladiatorial entrepreneur Proximo (Oliver Reed), Maximus conceals his true identity but, when thrown into the arena for the first time, he fights well as a team with the African Juba (Djimon Hounsou), who will become his closest confidant.\r In the meantime, of course, Maximus must survive arena combat that is heavily rigged against him. The gladiatorial contests are tense, dynamic and brutal, to be sure, and probably no less or more violent than most viewers would want them to be. Less fetishistic about the weaponry and modes of fighting than “Spartacus” and some other Roman combat pictures of yore, “Gladiator,” with its fast flurries of action and jump cuts, emphasizes the ferocious speed and urgency of every move in the arena, to the slight detriment of spatial unity and action continuity; in terms of the classical building of tension in a one-on-one fight, the standard is still the Anthony Quinn-Jack Palance battle in Richard Fleischer’s “Barabbas.”\r But “Gladiator” enjoys a solid foundation in the strength of Maximus, the vividness of its evocation of the Roman world and the integrity of the story arc. Script by David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson shrewdly appropriates touchstone moments from previous epics, just as it also cuts down the talk to a minimum when possible; there is none of the windy speechifying that ground many an epic to a halt in decades past. The action is presented in strictly Roman terms, with none of the Judeo-Christian angle so common to the genre in the ’50s.\r The film revels in both the glory and the horror that were Rome. Proximo’s luminous description of the Colosseum to Maximus beautifully conjures an image of what was then the center of the universe, and the games themselves are presented in context as gaudy, lowbrow entertainment. Countless details in Arthur Max’s brilliant production design and Janty Yates’ highly diversified costume design are offered up in wonderfully offhand fashion.\r But the scene stealer, in his last role before his death on location, is Reed, who hadn’t brought such relish to a performance in years, and to whom the film is dedicated. Proximo’s excitement over being able to return to Rome brings out the old man’s boyish delight in his profession, which he insists is just “entertainment,” and Reed clearly reveled in both the physicality and the modestly hammy opportunities the part presented. Pic reps a great sendoff for him and a fine way to be remembered.\r Production represented a gargantuan undertaking in four countries; even if the film is a big hit, it’s unlikely that the genre will come back in any significant way due to the costs involved. CGI effects have allowed numerous sets, notably the Colosseum, to be enhanced in size and spectacle value; the stunts, fights and battles are as forceful and realistic as anyone could want, John Mathieson’s widescreen cinematography is magnificent, and the pacing across 2½ hours is well modulated.",

Maximus is a brilliant Roman general, theA solid and epic blockbuster that still impresses us today.This film is set in the golden age of the Roman Empire, at the end of the reign of Marcus Aurelius and the early years of Emperor Commodus. Maximus is a brilliant Roman general, the favorite of the old emperor, who wishes to restore the Roman Republic and sees in his successor a project of bloodthirsty tyrant. However, Commodus manages to kill his father and succeed him before he carries out his plans, becoming absolute lord of Rome and orders to kill Maximus and all his family. Trapped and sold into slavery, he becomes a gladiator and, thanks to his training and military experience, quickly becomes one of the best. Finally, he returns to Rome, eager to avenge the tyrannical emperor who stole his life and family.Ok, this movie reminds me a lot of Ben Hur with all this story of revenge and injustice set in the Roman world, but let's talk first of what's good ... directed by Ridley Scott, has a good rhythm, no dead moments, and The director did a pretty good job. The script has an emotive story, with a coherent development that gives us strong and well developed characters. Russell Crowe did a good job and shines in the lead role in one of the films that shaped his career. Joaquin Phoenix also had one of the most remarkable films of his career here, giving his villain a \"rich narcissistic spoiled rich boy\" touch. Richard Harris made a good appearance in what would become one of his last film works. But the real good-bye to seventh art is Oliver Reed, giving life to Proximo, the head of the gladiator school. The prestigious actor passed away during the filming period. In the supporting cast, Djimon Hounsou and Connie Nielsen do a good job.However, the movie is not flawless. The film takes advantage of the names of two Roman emperors who actually existed and succeeded one after another. This turned out to be a problem ... in fact the lives of these two emperors have nothing to do with what this movie shows, and the use of names and contexts raises serious questions about likelihood and historical rigor. There are also some problems of lack of logic and credibility. Regarding the work of the actors, I negatively highlight the bad dialogues of this film, with absolutely cliché passages and excessive theatricality.At the technical level, the film uses and abuses CGI, the state of the art at the time, to provide us with breathtaking scenarios that bring to our time the exaggerated glory and monumentality of Ancient Rome. It would be hard to do better than this. The deeply epic soundtrack accentuates this monumentality and has become one of the best-selling and most famous soundtracks in contemporary cinema, in all fairness. The special and sound effects highlighted the brutality of the fighting quite well, while the sets and costumes correspond well to what we might expect in an epic movie this season.Unsurprisingly, and despite all the flaws, the film garnered five Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Costume, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects) at the 2001 ceremony.",

While it's not as shocking, disturbing, or otherwise counter-traditional as films that their class eats up and spits out 90+ ratings for, this masterpiece by Ridley Scott recaptures something special about epic films that has been almost entirely lost since the days of Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur, and Spartacus. This movie brings the notion of redemption to life in a way that makes you deeply empathize with the main character, Maximus. While a fictional work, it brilliantly captures the elegant and corrupt world Rome at its apex. With intense (but not over-the-top) battles fueled by choreography rather than CGI, cunning dialogue, and a truly honorable story, Gladiator deserves to be recognized for what it is, an iconic motion picture, among of the best of its time.\r In no universe should this film score a mere 13 points above Zach Snyder's substanceless meatgrinder '300'.",

Or at least according to me.\r The plot of the story is one of downfall and the returning of a great hero, warrior, and man. The plot takes you to a world that is possible to imagine and is so easily and well done that you could almost believe that the movie was in fact shot in Ancient Rome. It's so expertly written that I have watched it dozens of times and still enjoy every moment of it. The story adds to the setting, character development, and overall feel of the movie. It's an amazing film as far as storytelling goes.\r As for the acting I can even appreciate the main villain. He comes off as a whining, simpering lunatic with quite a lot of daddy issues. Most of the time the villain is the one person I find most uninteresting, but this time I did find him interesting and due to this wanted him to die so hard. As for the main role, played by Russel Crowe, Maximus is just the guy. He's the one guy I'd want in case of zombie outbreak. Batman is well and good, but Maximus is better. Batman can abandon you and go and fight the zombies by himself and then when he returns to you he can sit there and do some detective work to try and figure out why leaving you by yourself got you killed. While Maximus will ensure the survival of you, your friends, the kid with you, the dog, the cat, and the donkey you've all got following you. In short...best cinema hero ever. A believable hero too.\r The settings are just amazing and really suck you into the film. Every piece, every segment looks like something you would see in Ancient Rome. From the coliseum to the streets of Rome you're made to believe that they're all in an accurately depicted ancient civilization. Not to mention the costuming also plays a big role in giving you that feel. No one is dressed out of place and the costumes due the timeline and the movie honest justice.\r The music is amazing, and it stands out when it needs to, and fades to the back when it needs to. They did very well on that part and unlike many movies that just like to park trumpets in your face and blow your eardrums up this one has none of that. They did their music well and come on...I love Enya.\r In the end this is a beautiful, touching, gorgeous movie that's all heart. It had me crying my eyeballs out, and also got me thrilled. It's one of a kind and to this day Gladiator remains one of, if not my favorite, film of all time.",

My rear end deserved a big thumbs up from the Coliseum crowd for enduring two-and-a-half hours of schlock like this.

After the breathtaking build up to the film's opening battle in Germania, we are given a hyper edited bloodbath, full of horrid jumpcuts that do the film no favour in hiding the fact that it was done on digital cameras and didn't interest me at all, especially when compared to the intensely visceral opening battle in Gangs Of New York, which put jittery slow-motion and jump-cuts to much more effective (and this is a huge understatement). From then on, there is not one sequence in the entire film that works. The whole thing is one big boring, pompous, ugly and altogether hollow mess, so much so that it makes even Troy look thoroughly impressive in comparison. At least that had an interesting story, was aware of its own over-the-top masculinity, wasn't full of laughabley hokey politics and banal dialogue and didn't put a predictable division between the tough, ordinary Stallone-eque good guy and the weird, effeminate villain. Scenes were Commodus (Jaquin Phoenix) lusts over his sister Lucille (Connie Neilson) are unintentionally funny and have about as much resonance with what little story Gladiator has as those of the senate ranting about what they're going to do with Rome. The Colloseum fights are were the film really hits rock bottom. These loathesomely shot pieces of ruthless carnage are gratuitously bloody and devoid of either artistic or entertainment value. I wasn't so much disgusted or shocked as I was bored. The films also serves an unfortunate epitaph for Oliver Reed who is given some of the films most tedious monologues to read out, you can almost feel his boredom.

It was never outright like, \"Wow this is horrible,\" but it just did not manage to grip me. However, it eventually finally sank its teeth into me. First off, I loved the score. The score was so perfect for this film and really helped bring the film to life. In addition, the fight sequences were brilliantly choreographed and I also appreciate that while of course there has to be a lot of blood, it was never gratuitous. As for the acting, Russell Crowe did a really great job as Maximus, but for me, Joaquin Phoenix outshined him. Phoenix brought the consciously evil Commodus to life. I also loved seeing Tommy Flanagan in a small role here, as I love his current work in the TV series \"Sons of Anarchy\". Another plus for this film was certainly the screenplay. Tons of quotable lines and great speeches really helped to amplify this film.\r My complaints would likely center around the forced and unnecessary romance. It did not help move the film forward in the least. In terms of providing character history, it works, but as the action unfolds, it no longer really serves a purpose and felt like excess. In addition, the aforementioned slow beginning sequence was not overly to my liking, though I certainly understand why it is there and cannot complain over its conclusion. It simply did not provide the necessary spark to grab the viewers attention in my mind, but regardless, its importance is clear. Other than that, while typically top-notch, the CGI at times was noticeable with some unrealistic deaths along the way, but that is to be expected, as no film is perfect.\r Overall, Gladiator is a very good film that proves that these types of films can be done successfully if enough work is put into them. Very deserving of the praise it has received without a doubt.",

Ridley Scott's \"Gladiator\" is a masterwork of both the moving image and the written word, featuring striking visuals and production design as well as an appealingly classical narrative with welcomed Shakespearean undertones.
