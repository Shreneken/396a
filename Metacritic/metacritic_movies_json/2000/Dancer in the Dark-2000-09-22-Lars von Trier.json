    "critic_reviews": [
        "A thrilling, audacious work.",
        "It is a bold, reckless gesture.",
        "Can be unbearably moving or annoyingly mawkish, sometimes in the same scene.",
        "I was astonished to find myself weeping copiously over von Trier's latest, which is another parable of monomaniacal sainthood.",
        "You may leave this movie exhilarated by its no-holds-barred boldness or annoyed and bewildered at the unpredictable course it takes.",
        "This is a film like no other this year, and on that grounds alone you should see it.",
        "The song-and-dance numbers that make this musical tragedy a celebration of life despite its awfully grim climax.",
        "Slow and depressing, but ultimately haunting film.",
        "This deliriously downbeat vehicle for the postpunk diva Bj\u00f6rk has generated the controversy the Danish dogmatist has relentlessly court.",
        "My only reason to recommend this movie is that there's nothing quite like it.",
        "Aside from Bjork's astonishing performance, it's a grim tragedy that's deliberately drab and exceedingly painful to watch.",
        "Like a naive modernist hymn made by someone who doesn't, deep down, believe in hymns.",
        "What is meant to be an innovative, cutting-edge musical melodrama is so jumbled, irrational and amateurish that it makes dinner theater look like the Old Vic.",
        "This is the kind of movie that has always polarized serious film folk, while the public usually elects to stay home and prune shrubs.",
        "Both stupefyingly bad and utterly overpowering; it can elicit, sometimes within a single scene, a gasp of rapture and a spasm of revulsion.",
        "Fairly incompetent as a musical and rather silly as a drama.",
        "Lars von Trier is a mechanic, not an artist. And his movies are meat grinders he feeds his characters through.",
        "Two-and-a-half hour slice of unmitigated depression.",
        "At times the movie's crudeness has an eerie beauty, but the musical fantasies are a bewildering hash, and the protracted climax on death row is nearly unendurable.",
        "Bj\u00f6rk holds the movie together,  her natural charisma and the overwhelming intensity of her emotions should blind a lot of viewers to the ludicrousness of the story and the intentionally rotten videography.",
        "A 2\u00bd-hour demo of auteurist self-importance that's artistically bankrupt on almost every level.",
        "So exasperating in its contradictions, so frustrating in its fakery, so deeply irritating in its pretensions, it's frankly hard to know where to begin to dissect it."

Had this been done by a major famous Hollywood director, it'd be up for an Oscar - if anything for Bjork's wondrous lead performance. One thing that bothers me most about the critics giving poor reviews (20s, 30s, 40s) is that they blame it on the depression. \"This si 2.5 hours of pure depression,\" or \"the climax: with death row unendurable.\" It bugs me cause THATS WHAT THE MOVIE IS! It's supposed to be gut-wrenching, and heart-wrenching. It's supposed to make you cry. Make you feel. Make you hate it. It drains you mentally and emotionally, and, sometimes, physically. It's not unendurable though, cause you need to see what happens to her. And then that last song and it's pure misery backing it up - it really gets to you. And when it gets cut off.... one of the most depressing and best endings I've seen to a movie. Though probably the most depressing movie I've ever seen, and probably one of the most depressing movies EVER MADE... it's incredibly well done and it ranks among my favorites.",

The performances are great, specifically Bj\u00f6rk's one (this woman is really THE ART in itself). The story is black, cold. We are not invited to laugh in front of this movie, simply to see how cruel life can be. Depressing? Maybe, but life is sometimes worse than that.

The handheld style helps to feel like you are watching a woman's life unfold tragically before you.

Dogville, Antichrist, Manderlay and Dancing In The Dark, which this one is his most gripping work. Situated in a United States built in the middle of England, since the director refuses to ride a plane, but compensates by rebuilding the spirit of the country and its people with pesonal perfection, the film tells the story of the sweet and innocent Selma, suffering from a disease that will leave her blind and that by being hereditary, then began to affect his beloved son Gene. Despite being in immigrant status, work hard in a factory, living in a small trailer for the properties of a couple and have to struggle to save money for an operation for her son, who refuses to reveal, even tense moments in the film, Selma with her spirit always remains light and dreamy and outrageously good throughout the movie, a character without becoming silly or annoying, but incredibly exciting. After committing a crime is intention, Selma sees everything so that struggled to escape her control, but still insists her goal of helping her son and her good behavior not to harm anyone. After the event climax, all sequences become distressing and depressing, in placing side by side with the pain of the character and causing outrage, anger and absolute sadness in particular at the crime scene and the final sequence. The few, crucial musical moments, are very similar to the work of Bj\u00c3\u00b6rk, a somewhat surreal atmosphere, which take place in the mind of Selma, and act as a form of escapism from the harsh realities it faces. The acting is another highlight for the movie. Bj\u00c3\u00b6rk surprised with an interpretation intense and moving every second of the film, which unfortunately wasn\u00e2",

The first 1/3 of the movie or was rather stale, and poorly acted, this combined with distracting editing was anything but a turn on for me. But, as I continued to watch, it didn't bother me as much, because I was sucked into the compelling characters and story. I felt tangible pain several times in the movie when Bjork's character continued to destroy her life, just to keep up the facade of being unimpaired. Bjork, as a whole, was a spectacle to watch, I really bought into her blindness, and felt like I was watching the tragic story of a real Czechoslovakian immigrant. Her blindness didn't seem to be all that consistent, but for the most part, it was a well-implemented plot device. Going back to Bjork, the sounds that she brought to the movie were right up my alley, and after the credits started rolling, I found myself having bought the soundtrack and listened to it play a few times through before I went on to my next task of the day. The tension and emotion built up during the climax and finale were exquisite, and, had I been a more emotional person, I have no doubt I would have cried. Overall, this is a wonderful film that accomplished many things at once. It manages to be an 'anti-musical' critiquing the idealist nature of classic Hollywood musicals. It does this while also still managing to be an enticing drama with great sound to boot. I definitely recommend this to both fans of classic Hollywood musicals, like 'The Sound of Music' or 'My Fair Lady', and to those seeking an enticing and engaging drama.",

The movie was a slow burner for me as I'm not a big fan of musicals, yet by the final act I realised why it was so important for music to play such a big part. Yes this film is very depressing but I came out of watching it  feeling moments of glee thanks to the amazing soundtrack and very bittersweet ending.",

With Bj\u00f6rk's hidden talent of acting, the way she bought Selma jezkova to life and made her character feel substantial is so undoubtedly adequate.So, i personally do not like musicals but something about dancer in the darkAn amazing film! With Bj\u00f6rk's hidden talent of acting, the way she bought Selma jezkova to life and made her character feel substantial is so undoubtedly adequate.So, i personally do not like musicals but something about dancer in the dark is so appealing to watch, the story about a blind czech woman who tries to save her son from going blind too, aw mother's love, so tragic.This movie is just depression like fully, sad, emotional and touching. if you didn't feel for selma i'd assume you're an insensitive person.The icelandic actress put lots of effort and feelings to give us this shy and timid czech immigrant perhaps the total opposite of Bj\u00f6rk's personality.Nonetheless, a great film overall, perfect story, great acting, beautiful songs, And of course a sad ending that would leave you sobbing, for me personally i'd consider it one of the saddest 2000's films, the thing about it that it sort of gets boring in the middle but then suddenly something interesting happens, but anyway it's not an issue since well the plot is so emblematic, the acting makes you sob, and the way the pop star put such emotions into this character is so great even better than that i'm so speechless, i don't know but something about it is real and it still happens in our lives today, where immigrant women suffer a lot, such a human lesson and what a magnificent film overall.",
