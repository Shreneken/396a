  "critic_reviews": [
    "This bloody celebration finally gives the American Revolution the epic it deserves.",
    "Doesn't try too hard to be anything other than a vicarious experience that makes you crave the satisfaction you know you'll get when the hero gets his revenge.",
    "It has everything you want in an epic: sweep, scope, wild reversals of fortune and plenty of bold, basic emotions.",
    "Sentimental, overbearing, flag-waving--and a crowd-pleaser.",
    "If Emmerich had any sense, he would have ceded the direction of the battle scenes to his star.",
    "Has a flag-waving dumbness at its core.",
    "It is rousing and entertaining, and you get your money's worth.",
    "It's big, exciting, ambitious, and it makes you cry in all the right places.",
    "What might have been a treat for history buffs and a refresher course for the rest of us turns into just another occasion to watch Gibson shoot guns, swing tomahawks, and wreak other kinds of havoc on enemies we've been primed to hate.",
    "Emmerich might have had a masterpiece, but he'll have to settle for what comes close to being a must-see movie today.",
    "It's often corny, but it's never boring, and it'll sweep you up in its momentum if you give it a chance.",
    "The best movie I've seen about the Revolutionary War.",
    "It's depressing that this first movie in years to dramatize the American Revolution has so little to do with the politics of secession and so much to do with pop-culture themes of vigilantism.",
    "Mostly, the movie is riveting, well-done fare -- the stuff of Hollywood epic adventure.",
    "Has some emotional pull and isn't stuffy and dull.",
    "Only so much (pop)cornball tubthumping, a sweeping, occasionally stirring, always gorgeous bit of action-figure history.",
    "There's no denying that Emmerich's film, though a good half hour too long, keeps us watching.",
    "\"We, the people\" have never been big fans of movies about the American Revolutionary War. The Patriot, however, appears to be the movie that will break that historical jinx.",
    "It's a death-wish revenge thriller posing as a lavishly pastoral historical epic.",
    "Far from the smart historical epic some might have expected, is just another feisty summer shoot-'em-up.",
    "As a whole, though, the movie is much less magnetic or believable than its star.",
    "While the film contains some terrific, realistically bloody battle scenes, it has a distinctly Germanic feel, both in its epic heaviness and in the peculiar way it revises the history of the American Revolution.",
    "Gibson's performance is robbed of his customary humor, and he flounders around in search of the character's core.",
    "Patriot reflects on nothing, except perhaps that the American Revolution was a golden opportunity for Mel Gibson to go postal.",
    "Shamelessly stirring, brandishing Mr. Gibson's anguished masculinity like a musket. It may be effective, but you leave the theater feeling used.",
    "Trots out more flag-waving wartime cliches than any movie since John Wayne's \"The Alamo.\"",
    "Does benefit from Gibson's charisma...Whether it is quite good enough is another question.",
    "A movie of cornball sentiment, humorously anachronistic dialogue, and expensive Colonial Williamsburg sets.",
    "The film is long, empty and bogus.",
    "Seems likely to stir rebuttal from historians, especially those on the other side of the pond.",
    "The Patriot makes the Revolutionary War look like super-produced studio footage of the L.A. riots.",
    "Undeniably handsome..., but no cliché is left unturned, right down to the spray of toy soldiers falling from the hand of a dead child. Everything old isn't new again.",
    "Whatever extraordinary ingredients are necessary to fashion a 1776 home run, this movie doesn't have them.",
    "Overblown sanctimony and sentimentalism as corny as the Fourth of July."

Never, ever, in all my days, have I seen a movie so reckless in it's portrayal of history. The first problem the movie contains is a lack of any recognition of Slavery in America. The main character is based of a revolutionary hero who, owned, raped and killed his slaves as he wished. In fact American Slavery is completely ignored and the arrogant slave owning masters are now British... Just bizarre. The second problem lies in the portrayal of the British Army as Nazi's. A war crime is created (the burning church scene) in order to paint the British as monsters. This event did actually happen might I point out, in 1944 by the Nazis against a French town, literally making the British Appear as Nazis! People do take away lessons from movies and the blatant Anglo-Phobia and rampant lies this movie sells, in a shocking attempt to shove propaganda down your throat, making me feel physically sick.I mean the battle scenes were good I guess so 10/10",

This film begins badly: as I had occasion to refer to when I reviewedRoland Emmerich saw Mel Gibson's \"Braveheart\" and what did he do? He thought the US should have its own Braveheart and called Gibson to help, giving him the lead role. This film begins badly: as I had occasion to refer to when I reviewed \"Braveheart\", Gibson's film is terribly bad as far as historical accuracy is concerned, however appealing and cinematic it may be (and it is, its undoubtedly epic). This film is unfortunately not better, at least historically and with regard to the English, who are portrayed in an almost insulting way. Okay, there are atrocities in war but everything has limits, and the British still had, at this time, a mentality very much for the gentlemen's war, at least the officers. I accept the argument that its fiction and not a documentary, but even if it is, it should respect more its historical background. I believe that many Englishmen did not accept the way this film portrayed their army. Despite this, the film has some historically correct details, as is the case with all the well built and elegant colonial settings and the costumes, in particular the military uniforms. The way the soldiers fought, quite formal in its essence, is also historically accurate. As a piece of entertainment, the movie works well. The epic way it was designed is nice, looks great in movies and even on TV. It has an extraordinary soundtrack by John Williams and cinematography, colorful and vivid, looks great. I also give a word of praise to the actors, Mel Gibson particularly. This actor had an interpretive tone very similar to what he kept in \"Braveheart\" but without that horrible fake Scottish accent. Here, Gibson seems more at ease with his character, a man seeking personal revenge in the midst of all the conflict he engages in. Heath Ledger, still young, also gives serious evidence of talent. Joely Richardson and Tom Wilkinson met what was expected of them, even though their characters did not require much. Jason Isaacs gave life to the villain and, although his character is not credible at all, he can be very sadistic and scary, showing the cruelest side of the war.",

Almost no attention is paid through the entire movie to fleshing out the characters beyond a bit of their back stories and roles in the film. Heath Ledger is completely wasted in this thing, and Mel Gibson delivers the same bland performance as he does in any other movie; in fact during an ambush scene in the forest, I had trouble telling his character apart from the trees, his performance was that wooden.The movie relies on so painfully obvious set ups, story twists and cringe worthy cliches, that it makes you want to stop the movie so you can go to the bathroom and vomit. A complete disservice to the memory of the Revolutionaries. Congratulations, George Washington, you and your men's cause has been boiled down to a pathetic, cliched, pandering, unconvincing, shocking manipulative excuse for a film.

Mel Gibson gained on BraveheartOkay so I know what people are thinking if I was going to review The Patriot when they're thinking about the Steven Seagal version of The Patriot which has nothing to do with historical Revolutionary War. Mel Gibson gained on Braveheart before this came out. Why did I say that? It's because the battle scenes are similar. Hey, I haven't seen it I just know it. Mel Gibson plays Benjamin Martin the veteran of the French and Indian War and a widowed father of seven children. He refuses to go to war but his eldest son, Gabriel played by Heath Ledger goes to war to join the Continentals against his father's wishes. Colonel William Tavington played by Jason Isaacs and his army of British redcoats arrive to the house, captured Gabriel, Thomas tried to stopped them but is shot dead by Tavington calling him a stupid boy. So when their house got burned down, it's up to Benjamin to take down the redcoats. He and Gabriel joined up with his army of friends to take down a bunch of British redcoats once of for all to protect their family. So it's not that long for an epic war film but it does have some slow-paced moments that do fit for some part. As much as I enjoyed most of the action in the war it gets bloody. What people like especially women is the costume design. But there's only one scene that got to me in tears is where Benjamin's daughter, Susan telling him not to leave and she'll say anything he wants but he promises her he'll be back. That scene gets me anytime it gets emotional. I'm not gonna lie, it really did get me. Years ago this is something I checked out before I checked out the Lethal Weapon films now that's saying something 'cause I said before that Mel Gibson is one of my favourite actors of all time. I know there are people out there who don't really like the movie mainly because of it's antics of the American's hatred on the British and the Britain's hatred on the Americans especially when those redcoat b*****d's murdering innocent people, destroying their homes and families. But I'm not one of those people who hate this film, I liked it. It may not historically accurate but it is a fantastic war film with some good cinematography which really made the film look real in the war. Actually I heard somebody in the film mention the word \"accurate\". Mel Gibson, his character said it and the second time somebody else said it. Well, that's just the fact. I'd say give it a watch if you haven't already.",

If you do not believe me just make a comparison from characters, motivations and story arcs. It is the story of Benjamin Martin played by Mel Gibson who is a former soldier who is dragged into the Revolutionary war by dire circumstances and with this also the story of the war and struggles. Within. While the character is fictional I learned recently that he is also a mixture of historical characters. Again it is the Hollywood version of events full of emotion, glory and black and white morality. The truth is less nice but never point this out to US citizens as it is glorified and nearly a dogma. The reality was grim as there is no glory in war and both sides committed horrible crimes (which is a textbook definition for war by itself). However this is an entertainment movie and not a documentary so for me it does not influence my rating. I am not sure if it is as intense and emotional for non Americans as me. To shorten it the movie uses all the techniques to get immersion like Braveheart. This is show not tell, giving emotional impact, make the bad guys (enjoyable) evil, great scenery and breathtaking battles. However I think they have overdone it as there is to much pathos, patriotism and melodrama. It weakened the experience as it gave sometimes a disbelieving feeling that got me out of the immersion. There is nothing for me to criticize for the actors. The cast is well chosen and delivers their roles. I will praise Mel Gibson and Jason Isaacs as best performers in this movie. Both accomplish each other as their respective antagonists / nemesis. There are also some good jokes sparingly used in the movie. The main question that remains is why does this movie not work as good as Braveheart does? For me it is mostly that they overdone some aspects and we have seen it done better in other movies (The Braveheart comparison and similarity did also not help). Maybe Roland Emmerich is not as good as director too but I must remark that I see also no serious mistakes. Overall it is enjoyable but fast forgotten movie.",

The film does suffer from a number of things(similar problems I had with Braveheart actually), and the historical inaccuracy is pretty much the least of its problems.

The direction is nothing special, the pacing is too slow and the film is 10 minutes too long. The acting is lacking too, Mel Gibson tries hard with a very one-dimensional and unlikeable character but he struggles. In fact, only Heath Ledger gives a glimmer of hope and that is because he is the only character you feel sympathy for.

Gibson delivers yet another conflicted hero and portrays his struggle in an impressively tender but strong way. Isaacs also brings us a fantastic villain performance once again. While a joy to watch throughout, the film foes occasionally drag and could have done with a few more scene cuts. The script can be a little lackluster and clunky in terms of dialogue at times, and the storyline is relative predictable. However, the action and drama is enough to overshadow these flaws.",
