  "title": "Remember the Titans",
  "rating": 8.1,
  "release_date": "2000-09-29",
  "summary": "In 1971 high school football was everything to the people of Alexandria, Virginia. But when the local school board was forced to integrate an all black school with an all white school, the very foundation of football's great tradition was put to the test.  (Walt Disney Pictures)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Works better and cuts deeper than the mostly fictionalized \"Hoosiers.\"",
    "A civics lesson about integration very artfully - and entertainingly - disguised as an upbeat family sports movie.",
    "A huge surprise: a startlingly resonant yet unabashedly entertaining slice of American history, a popcorn movie with complex observations about, of all things, racism.",
    "Earns its emotional moments, and it takes the audience along.",
    "A conventional, button-pushing but emotionally affecting tale.",
    "Has the outer form of a brave statement about the races in America, but the soul of a sports movie in which everything is settled by the obligatory last play in the last seconds of the championship game.",
    "It has a good heart, though, and makes an amiable introduction to the integration battles of the '60s and '70s.",
    "Lively and inspirational, with terrific performances from a big star and a host of supporting players.",
    "It really does communicate an optimistic sense that race is irrelevant and we can all live happily ever after together.",
    "Washington and the others score in this predictable but rousing film where the big victory is over attitudes.",
    "Only a very stony heart could resist its pull.",
    "Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, in an atypically high-minded and low-budget frame of mind, manages to breeze through most of the gridiron genre's obstacles with his admirable, crowd-pleasing Titans.",
    "Ultimately nothing more than a live-action cartoon.  A high-minded, inspiring cartoon, but a cartoon nonetheless.",
    "The script's hokiness flattens the performances.",
    "A proudly unsophisticated demonstration of racial progress.",
    "Denzel Washington, by now, could do this sort of role in his sleep.",
    "A shrewd, pulpy crowd-pleaser.",
    "Herman Boone was no doubt a terrific football coach, but the lessons to be drawn from his success in Alexandria are ambiguous, and Remember the Titans is too wrapped up in its weepy macho sentimentality to address them clearly.",
    "If Remember the Titans is corny, it's unabashedly, even generously so.",
    "Earnest and well-intentioned.",
    "Perfectly effective when judged on its own merits, but is that really enough anymore?",
    "This mix of sweat and uplift in the Civil Rights era doesn't quite come off, despite some strong performances and the fact that it's based on a genuinely inspirational true story.",
    "The leads, Denzel Washington and particularly Will Patton, are so good they occasionally make you forget the material is shameless.",
    "Falls short of both the social history lesson it so pointedly strives to impart and the sport it so roughly embraces.",
    "History as filtered through the faux-liberal prism of Hollywood's dream factory, and an insult, I believe, to the people who actually carried the fight and endured the pain for civil rights.",
    "Simplistic and non-controversial, and thus is virtually guaranteed commercial success.",
    "Its heart is in the right place, but it has no soul.",
    "Bruckheimer's latest is in some crucial respects worse than those earlier blockbuster bids (\"Gone in  60 Seconds\" and \"Coyote Ugly\") -- certainly it's more fraudulent -- because unlike those films, which don't claim to be about anything other than thrills and tits, Remember the Titans means to be about race.",
    "A feel-good movie only in the sense that it wants to reassure today's white people about our own enlightenment and how far we've come in the evolution of our attitudes about race.",
    "So smug and so proud of itself, and you can tell that everybody involved conceives of it as a civics lesson instead of a story, that they squeeze all the life out of it.",
    "Boorish and flatulent."

The movie is an inspiring one as all sports movie tend to be, but if you are a tough nut to crack, you may start yawning at some places. It is quite predictable if you look at the movie objectively. There's the first half with all the good-for-nothing individuals, inspiration, motivation and boot camp training. Then there's the second half with the initial hardships, near losses, the inspired masterstroke and the big final win. But thanks to the racial undertone, the proceedings are dramatic enough to watch.The script is inconsistent that is it is too weak/lame at some points but very strong in other instances. Almost all energy has been put into making sure that everything looks right from the outside. Individual characterizations are poor and it shows in the actors' performance. Some scenes are written beautifully but some scenes fail to impress. The director Boaz Yakin too surprisingly sticks with the script and doesn't explore the many possible angles.Denzel Washington does an amazing job at the centre playing the insanely tough and bullish coach, Herman Boone. Will Patton who plays his calm deputy Bill Yoast is passive in the first half (thanks to the poor writing) but comes to the foreground and gives an acceptable performance as the movie progresses. Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst share a great chemistry and give believable combined performances playing leaders of the black and white bandwagon respectively.The football scenes are a treat to watch. Make sure you know the jargon and tactics of football because if you don't enjoy them, you are gonna miss half the fun. Everything from the warm ups, the handful play sequences, the individual player's sacrifice for the good of the tea and the exchange between the coaches. The choreographer (if its the right word) deserves a round of applause for his work. Watch it if you are a fan of Denzel Washington or if you want to discover the meaning of team spirit. Watch the movie expecting exactly whats present in it and you will be impressed and walk out completely satisfied. But if you randomly walk in hoping to see something a class apart from others, this one will be a bit of a disappointment. But all in all, the experience will be worth 'remembering'...well at least for sometime.",
