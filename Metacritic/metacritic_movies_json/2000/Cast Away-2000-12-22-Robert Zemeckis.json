  "summary": "Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a FedEx systems engineer whose personal and professional life are ruled by the clock.   His manic existence abruptly ends when, after a plane crash, he becomes isolated on a remote island - cast away into the most desolate environment imaginable.   (Twentieth Century Fox)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Hanks towers as a near naked, near biblical man. Zemeckis tells his story -- the screenplay is by William Broyles -- with a control magnificent in what isn't shown as much as in what is.",
    "Finally, the man (Hanks) has delivered a moving, slightly unhappy, and ultimately hopeful story in which squishy love takes a backseat to the wondrous whirlwind of life.  The season's most delightful surprise.",
    "A handsomely constructed and executed movie, the kind of effort that deserves appreciation, on its own terms, for what it both dares and accomplishes.",
    "Just be glad that Hanks and Zemeckis toiled mightily to pull off at least two-thirds of a remarkable achievement.",
    "It's mournful and troubling in a way that goes beyond ordinary movie manipulation. It burns clean.",
    "At its best, Cast Away, like \"Titanic,\" awes us with its sheer oceanic sweep and its cosmic apprehension of human insignificance.",
    "If there's anyone who can make this ordeal -- and when you're plumb out of characters, it can be an ordeal -- tolerable, and even entertaining, it's Hanks.",
    "Hanks gives possibly the most compelling performance of his career.",
    "The island phase of Hanks' performance is simply amazing.",
    "The middle 90 minutes, which put Hanks alone on an island without voice-over narration or even a musical background, is as risky as anything Hollywood did this year.",
    "Hanks's extraordinary acting keeps the adventure involving even though the beginning is predictable, the middle is uneven, and the finale slips into Zemeckis's patented brand of \"Forrest Gump\" fuzziness.",
    "Here is a strong and simple story surrounded by needless complications, and flawed by a last act that first disappoints us and then ends on a note of forced whimsy.",
    "While \"Robinson Crusoe\" was a paean to the practical middle-class virtues that allowed its industrious hero (and the nation he represents) to re-create civilization out of nothingness, Cast Away is a far less triumphalist peek into the nothingness at the heart of civilization.",
    "This is no film for the squeamish.",
    "The 80 minutes it spends on the atoll alone with Hanks make for engrossing storytelling. The film is less sure-footed back in civilization.",
    "Meticulous, sumptuous production design, and striking visuals compensate for the lack of dramatic momentum in a film that arguably stretches narrative form to its limits.",
    "At its most basic level, Cast Away is a graceful and powerfully rendered survivalist saga.... And yet there's something generic about Chuck's plight. The filmmakers don't opt for the usual happy-face Hollywood ending, but even the half-smile they provide smacks of inspirationalism.",
    "Solid and inspiring will do nicely for Christmas, but it ought not to be good enough for the Oscar nominations that will almost certainly rain upon this movie's adequate head.",
    "Comes off as convincing but never compelling. There's a ponderous quality to it, as if it's forever clearing its throat to say something of value that doesn't quite get articulated.",
    "Hanks and Zemeckis (and writer William Broyles Jr.) are so intent on making an epic of the spirit that they can't bring themselves to acknowledge the comic, narcissistic side of their desert island fantasy. And so on simple, human terms, the picture gets all gummed up.",
    "Too full of its own heavy breathing to work as the primordial storytelling it's aiming for--a so-so adventure story is closer to the mark.",
    "It will bring joy in a way certainly not intended, as one of the most gloriously and unwittingly silly films ever devised by a major American filmmaker."

An incredibly well known film, there is not much new to be said about Cast Away other than to say that I really enjoyed it. It was brilliantly acted by Hanks and damn, the film made us care about a volleyball. Sure, it is a bit by-the-numbers in the way things happen and the film itself breaks little new ground, but that is just fine by me, as long as it is well done. In the case of Cast Away, that is certainly the case. It is very well directed by Robert Zemeckis and very well written. Other than Hanks, nothing about this film is excellent, but all of it is good all the same. The special effects here were also really well done and the crash sequence was brilliantly executed and packed with excitement. This one really puts you through every emotion possible, which ultimately, is what film is supposed to do. Overall, Cast Away is a very well made and brilliantly acted film that entertains in bunches.",

It consists of a deep psychological drama, which brilliantly explores the despair, depression, the need to survive in extremely harsh conditions, homesickness, loneliness. If we add to these features the particularity of the film has virtually only one character during most of the time (Helen Hunt plays an essential role in the plot but appears very little), could be expected a film absolutely still and lifeless. But it's not the case. The film uses the psychological ups and downs of Chuck (the main character, played by Tom Hanks) to keep moving and avoid dead times, finding space for great moments of tension and hilarious moments of humor. Hanks is a highly capable and talented actor, able to suck his character to the bone and do a first class job, truly chameleonic. Literally, Hanks carries the film with the back thanks to this superb performance. The sets and shooting locations are also worth a positive word.",

He shines here again and although it is not a big hit like Forrest Gump, it is still a great film in my eyes. The plot is quite simple. The magic is that it doesn't quite go to plan and our main character finds himself on an island where no one is. That's where all the fun begins. The whole island just sort of snaps away. I really enjoyed it. A beautiful setting, of course, hiding hunger and loneliness, though it doesn't take long for our hero to find a ball to start having fun with. Crazy maybe, but who wouldn't go crazy after being alone on an island for so long with no one and still feeling like you might die. In the end, I was happy with the film except maybe a little bit for the ending, which in my opinion was already a bit drawn out. In short as I mentioned the island is the main and by far the best thing this movie has to offer and once it's over it's pretty much over. Thankfully it didn't take long for the film to end. So for me, a great movie that I recommend.",

The sheer frustration he has is clear, as is understandable, I mean just imagine the thoughts he must have, not knowing if he'd ever be found. Can you imagine what you'd do, if you were in that situation?Its hard not to wince at times too, he gets his share of pain through certain situations, which of course adds to his frustration.As the movie goes on and of course time passes by, he becomes more vocal and makes a face out of one of the items he found in one of the Fed Ex packages - a volleyball, which he names Wilson and starts talking to more and more, as if it were human. The lack of human contact clearly affects him, as it would affect anyone, I imagine.Alot of the emotions are only evident from his facial expressions and later on from his frustrated and sometimes hopeful outcries and dialogue/banter with Wilson (the volleyball).Its not hard to feel sorry for the guy in this situation (although at the start of the movie, he is portrayed more as a bit of a jerk, bossing people about and complaining when he doesn't get to where he's supposed to be quite in time) and it is intriguing, like I say, to see how he copes and adapts to whats available to him.Seeing how he changes as time passes by is also quite sad or depressing in one sense but in another it indicates some real strength and will I guess. I wonder how long it would be possible to last in such a situation? he clearly misses his wife, having a framed photo of her that takes pride of place among his belongings. As time passes by, he realises what a large area there is for any search party to cover and his hope of being found diminishes but of course, you have to see the movie to find out if he is rescued eventually or not.The sort of friendship that evolves between Chuck and Wilson is kind of intriguing. I guess some would say that it marks the start of his mental well being deteriorating, he certainly converses with 'Wilson' as if it were a fellow human, initially painting a face on it as I mentioned previously, to even more humanise it. Tom Hanks does pretty well in portraying the character of Chuck, certainly, as I say, you can see the emotions, the frustation and fear, on his face.I guess the message behind it is to do with taking a step back from our busy workload and lifestyle and to think about the basics, hey at least we have food, drink, shelter and human company, well, most of us do anyway, right?While this might sound like a fairly boring movie, there is the ocassional dramatic scene, not including the plane crash, though its also fair to say that they are a bit few and far between.There is the odd squeamish moment, I would warn, if you don't like blood, just be aware, its only the occasional but it made me look away, I'm not good with that sort of thing I'll admit!The way the story plays out and the character of Chuck is shown, I felt it intrigued, certainly me anyway, to watch on and find out what became of him.The film does a good job of making you see quite how isolated he is too, with the vastness of the ocean surrounding him.I thought, given the ending as well, that this is a movie that feels like it is trying to give a message to its viewers, about making us think about our hectic lifes and whats really important. This may put some off I suppose, I wouldn't say thats overly preachy really, its more at the very end that this is really brought home, you could say.I thought that this was a good movie worth watching.",

Through is performance and Robert Zemeckis direction, we see a story of taking each day at a time if this sort of situation arose, not a 'right heres what Im going to do' type story, that is unrealistic, we see him licking water from a leaf for goodness sake, it brings everything to the table, being alone, emotional withdrawal and lengths we would go to just to stay alive, who ever thought of needing the dentist while on a deserted island.\rHanks delivers a stellar performance, his weight loss as the film progresses is clearly visible, another indication of ability to to place himself in the mind of whoever he is portraying.\rThis film was of course the birth of the infamous 'wilson ball' friendship which Hanks had with a simple blood stained Wilson ball, this was ahidden message within which was in are darkest and most despaired moments, its simplest things we can turn to, no matter who or what, to realise who we are and what we are capable of.\rWhat was surprising the most was how Hanks convinced us how alone he really was, talking to 'Wilson', fighting with coconuts and attempting to escape, it was all these realistic and yet simplistic gestures which created a thrilling journey and emotional performance from Hanks. It was definitely the quieter moments with no dialogue that really showed the capabilities of of Hanks, so much more than Forrest Gump on a desert island.\rFedEx need to maintain a reputation after this film, Hanks, on the other hand, has nothing to prove, see this to believe the brilliance.",

I fully agree with Hanks` Oscar nomination for this role. I guess he is the only thing holding this film from being a failure. The music is good, though it doesn`t go too well with what we`re watching. The effects and pictures are well made, though they do not contribute in any better way.  I divide this film into chronological 3 pieces. The first one is good, mostly because there is realatively alot of happening and we see the planecrash. The second one I found to be boring. Here, as much as Hanks tried to keep me interested, it didn`t really work as there was not much content to it. We see how he tries to survive on the island, how he builds his home and what difficulties he faces. There is not enough psychology to the main character which would serve the movie well in this central time-piece. It seems that the director didn`t really have an idea how to portrait it. The third piece of the movie is going home, watching how time went by and how things changed. It is supposed to be sad inspite of a miracle that brought Chuck back. Also Helen Hunt didn`t get a chance to shine, as she plays it roughly average. A movie that is nice to see but doesn`t manage to execute too well.",

The airplane crash scene, with the haunting noise of the swirling plane, the virtually realistic performance of the plane crew, especially Hanks' fright, is just an amazingly directed AND choreographed scene. Was it right for Helen Hunt's character to move on? Absolutely. Zemeckis has lent true validity to her character - she may have moved on, but she's still caring enough to keep every track of her boyfriend's voyage, from the time he got on the plane to the time he came back to the civilized world. I especially enjoyed the movie soundtrack theme during the \"Wilson, I'm sorry\" part - it was just apt. No overblowing orchestral music, just the right mix for a moving, serious film. We all have our fantasies - what if we were stranded alone on a remote island, without nothing to eat or drink? Hanks does it impeccably....it's totally understandable and reasonable for him to learn to break a coconut in half, sip water from a leaf, go exploring his new surrounding, or learn how to make fire. I was fascinated by how the story built up - and impressed by how Zemeckis keeps our eyes on the screen by simply focussing on Nolan, and not in how the world back home might have been reacting. The movie might be a fantasy-theme, but in no scene does it venture into the unknown, or the unrealistic - it is as normal as one would probably find themselves in, if one were alone in that environment. I recommend it very much - not in the least the penultimate scene when Nolan drives into his ex-girlfriend's house in a rainy evening. The characters do apt justice to their roles, how would you feel if the person whose dreams sustained you in that remote island for four years has now moved on, had a family of her own? Hanks and Hunt are just brilliant in their characters. Cast Away is a brilliant movie - watch it for positivity and optimism, not with scepticism or negativity - it is highly moving and uplifiting. I should know - it is one of my wife's favorite movies! Of course, there will always be questions asked about movie plots and directions, I can surely do without them!",

One of the most interesting and, often, unsung aspects of \"Cast Away\" is that Zemeckis and his crewRobert Zemeckis' \"Cast Away\" is a movie that is not only a revolutionary piece of film, but it is as poignant and affecting as they come. One of the most interesting and, often, unsung aspects of \"Cast Away\" is that Zemeckis and his crew basically crafted this movie on the fly and during production. In fact, the whole concept of \"Wilson The Volleyball\" was not conceived until about halfway through shooting. Another interesting aspect of the film is that a very large portion of it has no dialogue, yet it still remains highly entertaining experience. Much of the film's complexity comes from the incredibly moving performance as Chuck Noland, a FedEx engineer who is tragically separated from everything he loves. Which leads me to another point, and, possibly, my favorite aspects of \"Cast Away\" - the themes conveyed. The movie is deeply driven by the central idea that life can be cruel and unforgiving thing, but that shouldn't stop us from pursuing something better. This theme is accentuated to an enormous degree by the movies soundtrack by Alan Silvestri. Though the soundtrack is absent throughout most of the first half of this movie, the movie's main theme is slowly introduced towards the end of the film. It's a very solemn musical piece that effectively illustrates the pain the Chuck Noland experiences throughout the movie, but it also presents a sort of hopeful tone to the film. In the end, I feel that \"Cast Away\" presents a number of innovative and impressive techniques that, ultimately, make it a near-perfect film.",

      "content": "Director Robert Zemeckis and star Tom Hanks take tremendous risks -- both dramatic and commercial -- and for the most part succeed, in \"Cast Away.\" In this bold and unique story about a single character stranded on an island, a top-notchDirector Robert Zemeckis and star Tom Hanks take tremendous risks -- both dramatic and commercial -- and for the most part succeed, in \"Cast Away.\" In this bold and unique story about a single character stranded on an island, a top-notch Hanks holds the picture on his shoulders with a bravura perf.\r “Cast Away” bears thematic resemblance to “Forrest Gump,” the earlier Zemeckis-Hanks teaming, in its focus on the personal journey of an Everyman. But the 1994 Oscar winner spanned decades and numerous locales, with its hero the only constant; however, the bulk of the new pic is confined to one setting and a much tighter time frame, depicting in detail the moral odyssey of one man.\r Hanks, who serves as a producer, plays an ambitious FedEx system engineer whose life, run with the precision of a Swiss watch, is shattered when his plane crashes, leaving him alone on a remote island.\r The narrative is divided into four asymmetrical parts. Set in 1995, the first segment establishes Chuck’s manic personal and professional lives. His fast-paced career takes him, often on a moment’s notice, to far-flung cities such as Moscow, away from his loving g.f., Kelly (a splendidly understated Helen Hunt). Returning home on a FedEx plane, Chuck can’t wait to spend Christmas Eve with Kelly. But a mechanical problem on the plane causes a terrifying crash, filmed with unprecedented, gritty realism. In the second segment, Chuck is forced to deal with the most basic biological needs. Film plays up well the irony of a career-driven man, used to solving problems, faced with the most urgent problem of all: sheer survival.\r Cut to four years later. Tale now finds Chuck trim and muscular, sporting long blond hair and a bushy beard and stripped to a Tarzan-like outfit. Having mastered the four basic needs — food, water, shelter and fire — he begins to deal with his need for companionship.\r While his memories of Kelly are essential to Chuck’s survival, he also establishes an unusual relationship with “Wilson,” a volleyball washed ashore inside a FedEx package from the doomed flight. Playing a crucial role, Wilson rescues Chuck from solitude as well as depression. This fellowship also allows Chuck to speak — after an hour’s worth of mostly silence.\r Driven forward by the strength and struggles of its hero, “Cast Away” takes admirable risks while avoiding pitfalls. Story stays close to the ground, literally, maintaining a coherent p.o.v., with Chuck the center of attention; there are no cuts to society’s or Kelly’s reaction to Chuck’s disaster.\r Fate gives Chuck a chance to fight his way back to civilization in a daring escape, only to face an unexpected emotional challenge that, in many ways, is more demanding than the physical ones he survived. Though there’s closure, the last segment deviates refreshingly from a conventional Hollywood ending.\r Building a script, based on journals of shipwreck victims, William Broyles Jr. creates a skillful work in which events and emotions are brought to life with sparse dialogue and little music; the first melodic sound is heard 90 minutes into the story.\r Pic is replete with ironies and subtle humor. As a FedEx exec, Chuck is dedicated to connecting people all over the world, but the yarn throws him into a situation in which he is disconnected from everything. Moreover, the island’s pristine beauty and serenity stand in contrast to Chuck’s civilized life. The irony is that for most people the Fiji islands rep tropical paradise, whereas for Chuck they become a prison.\r And Zemeckis gives the film heart, depicting Chuck’s efforts to get water, make a knife out of stone, and (in one of the film’s most humorous scenes) crack a coconut.\r The film revolves around a key question: Once you have learned to survive physically, how do you survive emotionally and spiritually? While Chuck opens the FedEx packages that have washed ashore, he decides not to open one that’s adorned with angel wings, which becomes a symbol of hope — one he holds onto even after his return.\r More problematic is the suggestion that if Chuck hadn’t lost everything, he would never have come to understand what’s truly important. It’s here that the film gets excessively academic and metaphysical. Ultimately, “Cast Away” is about realizing the true meaning of belonging, of finding home, casting away the clutter that complicates life in an effort to rediscover what matters.\r This issue comes into focus in the last reel. The helmer shows again his mastery of mise-en-scene: Chuck’s return to civilization is so brilliantly staged that it almost makes up for the unexciting spots at the center.\r It’s hard to imagine this film without the captivating perf of Hanks, who reaches another height in an already impressive career. Filmed in sequential order, “Cast Away” may be the only pic shot in two parts over 16 months, with a one-year hiatus to allow for Hanks’ physical transformation.",
