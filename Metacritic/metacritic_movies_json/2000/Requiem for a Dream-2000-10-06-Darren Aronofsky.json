  "critic_reviews": [
    "Aronofsky has fashioned a chilling vision that lives up to the caustic irony of its title and gives us a nightmare that is not lightly forgotten.",
    "May be the first movie to fully capture the way that drugs dislocate us from ourselves.",
    "He (Aronofsky) has put together a phantasmagoria of self-destructive obsession that is so visually astounding it becomes its own saving grace. Otherwise, we might not be able to bear it.",
    "Burstyn is astonishing, forsaking all vanity to make silly biddy Sara a fully dimensioned human being.",
    "Be warned: it's a downer, and a knockout.",
    "A work of art whose beauty has the eternal power of redemption.",
    "A fluent, intelligent piece of work whose sex and violence are anything but gratuitous, and exactly the kind of highly personal, no-holds-barred vision of life on the ragged edge that independents always aspire to but rarely have the goods to achieve.",
    "A powerful fable about love and addiction that manages to be darkly humorous when it isn't graphic or harrowing in the extreme.",
    "An unrelentingly dark vision that's as hard to watch as it is impossible to walk away from.",
    "Aronofsky brings a new urgency to the drug movie by trying to reproduce, through his subjective camera, how his characters feel, or want to feel, or fear to feel.",
    "Locks in on its self-destructive subjects so precisely, it's almost unbearable to watch.",
    "Easily the most searing movie-going experience of the year.",
    "The tremendous power of Aronofsky's filmmaking -- its omnivorous omnipotence, if that makes any sense -- has the curious effect of diluting its emotional impact.",
    "Haunts the memory long after you've left the theatre.",
    "Often, Requiem for a Dream is as technically inventive and daring as the Scottish heroin film \"Trainspotting,\" but it has more resonance and feeling. And when Burstyn is on screen, it often becomes heartbreaking.",
    "May be an elaborate stunt, a bungee jump, but even so, it's forceful enough to leave a rare palpitating residue.",
    "Becomes increasingly unwatchable -- not just bleak but punishing, as if the director wants to fry your circuits along with his characters'.",
    "Love it or hate it -- and I suspect, frankly, most people are going to hate it -- this is like no other film you've ever seen.",
    "It’s technically striking filmmaking, to be sure, but what it’s presenting is nothing that many people will want to look at.",
    "This bleak vision directed by Darren Aronofsky (\"Pi\") is pointless with good reason.",
    "It's one of the most beautifully unpleasant movies ever made - its reverse charge being that it is no fun at all.",
    "Aronofsky has given us a well-acted, gorgeously overwrought and luridly entertaining exploitation flick -- a midnight movie for future generations.",
    "While director Aronofsky pistol-whips your attention with his style, the characters (mostly relegated to human mannequins in Aronofsky's visual schemes) suffer big time.",
    "Chilling and technically proficient and, also, fairly hollow.",
    "To be fair, Aronofsky has a knack for stylistic overkill, and his hammering onslaught is undeniably riveting, at first anyway.",
    "Solid acting helps the story stay earthbound when Aronofsky's filmmaking gets addicted to its own flashy cynicism, but the picture sometimes seems as dazed and confused as the situations it wants to criticize.",
    "Far too complex and provoking.",
    "Never the heart-wrenching emotional experience it seems intended to be.",
    "It's two hours of slumming in a vision of hell hatched from bourgeois comfort. That, and not its unsavory subject matter, is what makes it bummer theater.",
    "Too self-consciously dark, too aware of its long, murky, art-designed descent into the underbelly of America's addictive personality.",
    "In the end the movie goes nowhere a hundred movies haven't already been and tells us nothing we don't already know. It does so with so much violent energy, however, it's like four brutal years at film school crammed into an hour and a half."

The film talks about family conflicts, couple problems, friend disagreements, racist fights, poor environments and all of these immersed in the drugs world. Obviously the points of view towards these problems are four, the one of Harry (who is trying to be successful and have a job), his girlfriend (who is looking her happily ever after), his mother (who wants to be remembered after her dead, by appear on television) and his best friend (who is hoping to live without worries and just enjoying the moment). In another way, this people is trying to accomplish something that is very difficult to find in the real world, so the solution is to escape from the reality; here is when the four path joins in a common point: the drugs, which represent the release of their minds. In this part Darren Aronofsky use the expressionist and surrealistic images, like the sequence when they take drugs, the attack of the TV people with the refrigerator and the zombie ending. Finally the four people end in the same way as if they were only one body. All of this is enhance by a marvelous direction, astonishing performances, excellent script and shocking music. This is a requiem for the beloved housewife, the worker son, the empathic girlfriend and the supporting friend. It is a requiem for achieving perfection. A Requiem for a Dream.",

Yeah, this movie proves that drugs not only ruin your life, but they also come in many places. You just have to know where. My favorite part about the movie is the fast-paced editing. It gets more and more intense as the movie goes on and really adds that freaky feeling about drugs. Also, I personally quite enjoy the snorricam in this. It just adds to the surreal feeling.

Not to sound pompous but if i was from a sheltered middle class suburban upbringing I'd probably find some othe sens painfully graphic, but having done my time in the ghettos (plural) I've seen way worse.  The directing was the most entertaining aspect.  The story, well, even if I hadn't experienced some of it in person I'd have read about it countless times before seeing this simply because I'm middle aged.  So I guess you might also have to be kind of young to be shocked as well.  It's well crafted and if you feel like you 'should' see it so you understand the current pop culture references, then do so.  It's not a waste of time.  If you want to see the real thing though, check out 'Dope Sick Love'.  It's a mind blowing doc that's readily available for free online. Just google it.

I love the style in which it is filmed, there are lots of split-screen technique, exaggerated sound effects and huge close ups, and all these manage to be stylishly used. The music is stunning too, Aronofsky directs superbly and the script is brutal and very honest. Requiem for a Dream has one underlying theme, the creeping menace of addiction, this theme is explored in a lot of forms and with chilling and compelling effect. Not only that, the highs and lows of drug-taking are conveyed. The story is hard-hitting, moving and draws you in and the characters feel real. The acting helps with this, Ellen Burstyn is amazing and gives one of the best performances of the decade. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are also excellent, and Marlon Wayans I think hasn't been better. In conclusion, a powerful film, while not all people may like it it is for me one of the most important films on this subject. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

A masterpiece over here!Personally, I have watched 'Requiem for a dream' three times, but the counting will carry on for sure. First in this movie, I must say, impress the directing, brilliantly combined with the topic - drugs, how they affect you and destroy your life. No chance, you miss that. Typical for the dramas, the accent is put on the details, the visual  influence by facial impressions and sounds. Here, oh Lord.. Crazyyy directing. We could argue a lot about what's more important - good directing or good story and in the end we end up without conclusive answer, BUT some movies just impress you with that art of setting things in place. Second, Jared Leto in main role makes the movie even more touching.  This man is god damn beautiful, talented and most of all there is something about him, that let him very very much impact you and drive you in the story. And that last thing represent supreme characterization of a masterpieces. The whole acting by every one of the actor crew could not be better. .Shortly, perfect cinematography and soundtracks, story and acting, basically everything. A movie, that will touch you and make you shake.",

Directed by Darren Aronofsky, it has a screenplay by Hubert Selby Jr. and the participation of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly.This is one of the most disturbing films I've seen. But this is not a defect. In fact, its the greatest quality of this film: it changes the way we think. Shocking and assertive, it shows how a person is able to dispose of their own luck, focusing on what he want and wasting the good things he already have. And the more disturbing becomes when we recognize, in the attitudes of the characters, our own attitudes or people we know. Decidedly, its a film that puts anyone thinking, it was made for this and not as entertainment.The script is exceptional, the concept is innovative. The way the director drove all the work is very competent and was decisive for the final result. Speaking about final, the end of the film is disturbing and not recommended for sensitive people, as well as several other scenes. The actors performance is good, particularly Ellen Burstyn, who is unrecognizable in her role. The sets and costumes are regular. The photography is excellent, becoming darker and sinister as the characters go \"down the pit\".

They make extreme amounts of money from their deals and dream of opening a fashion store.\rAs the two stories unfold, we watch as each of the four peoples addiction grows out of control and the effects to which their lives begin to spiral, the title truly bears fruit to the lengths these individuals go to for what they believe to be a better life.\rElllen Burstyn puts in an emotionally stirring performance as Sara, forever fantasising of her life in a gameshow, and her struggle to come to grips with reality are perfectly portrayed here, simply for the love of her son.\rThe multi-talented Jared Leto continues to shine, playing the conflicted Harry, who we never quite understand just how much he loves his mother, as when he is around her he seems uneasy. his characters relationship with is also addicted girlfriend starts off quite simple, but we soon realise that he will do anything he can to please her, whatever his actions.\rDarren Aronofsky's superb filmmaking comes in with a bang in this film, combining close up shots with a montage of quick cuts to emphasise the speed and evolved nature of each persons addiction, and he tells a wonderful story as how the ambitions can indeed be dangerous, many things that people reach for could have tragic consequences, but unfortunately an idea can spread.\rCombining expert filmmaking and a gripping story, along with a superb cast, Aronofsky has created a truly breathtaking yet tragic film, one that will not be forgotten, simply because of its meaningful story and heartbreaking finale.",

His use of numerous film-making devices from close up action shots of everything from the dilation of a pupil to the sipping of a cup of coffee, sound effects that enhance the action, side by side panoramic shots, high speed action shots, and many other techniques all come together to truly allow the viewer to feel what the character feels, to experience his or her inebriation end ultimately despair as desire and withdrawal come into play in the latter half of the film. At times such stylistic directing doesn't allow for character growth, but nonetheless when the characters are able to grow, they do so beyond measure. From simply desire of the drug and love for one another, they move to dependence and we see that become their only focus. Then Afronsky shows us the deepest dark of  addiction. From simple withdrawal to prison to prostitution to hospitalization and even to an amputation, the characters end in far different places and circumstances. But nonetheless, in the end, all the characters face the same loneliness, the loneliness that comes when one has sacrificed all else for the drug that gives him nothing. This film takes different circumstances and ultimately brings them together in the most tragic of ways. While not a perfect film, Afronsky proves that he is a director not to be reckoned with.",

Son regard acéré et la peinture cauchemardesque qu'il en fait sont indéniablement l'équivalent d'une grosse mandale en pleine gueule et pour autant, on ne peut accuser le film d'exagérer, car nous savons bien qu'il a raison, cent fois raison.Son réquisitoire ne s'apitoie pas, bien au contraire et montre la misère mentale, affective et le désespoir à la manière d'une étude clinique, impitoyable où les vaines espérances des protagonistes sont finalement broyées et avalées par leur addiction terminale. Ce requiem n'utilise aucun recul fût-il cynique, satirique ou même empathique, car son but n'est qu'une démonstration claire et simple : \"regardez ce que ça fait\" et point barre. Aucune rédemption pour ces pauvres hères tourmentés : ils en sont les seuls responsables.Cette approche ne plaira pas à tout le monde et s'il est un reproche que l'on pourra faire au film est de ne jamais arrondir les angles mais au contraire de les affûter pour les rendre coupants comme des rasoirs. La musique de Clint Mansell reflète cette dureté, brutale et âpre, torturée et parfois dissonante.La mise en scène sèche et cinglante d'Aronofsky y participe également au moyen de toutes sortes d'effets très inventifs pour illustrer son propos et les acteurs décidément brillants ne sont pas en reste. Un film paradoxalement désagréable et en même temps d'une efficacité redoutable et... impitoyable !",

You want a more... INSPIRED message in the end, or at least a somewhat happy ending! But you don't get it.
