  "critic_reviews": [
    "The special effects work fine for minor acts of magic, but the climactic aerial dragon fight is lame, and most of the performances are at the level of high school plays.",
    "Malty brew of heroics and minutiae.",
    "Jeremy Irons, giving what is, hands down, the worst performance of his career.",
    "Dungeons & Dragons looks like they threw away the game and photographed the box it came in.",
    "The audience has already checked out, long before the formulaic finish.",
    "Good intentions, bad writing.",
    "Whalin is awful, Birch is saddled with lines that would make a silent film star blanch and Irons devours huge chunks of scenery with the ferocity of one of those dog-fighting dragons.",
    "A cheap \"Star Wars\" rip-off with swords instead of light sabers.",
    "Stinketh like the breath of a dyspeptic dragon.",
    "This fantasy crap, fake-o effects and all, betrays princes of dice, masters of graph and wielders of bong.",
    "Take this as a warning: it's not much fun.",
    "Horribly slapdash affair.",
    "The plot somehow manages to be both hackneyed and convoluted.",
    "Stunningly bad sci-fi/fantasy hokum.",
    "Maybe I should let a role of the dice determine whether I use a cudgel or a broadsword to put this puppy out of its misery.",
    "At once laboriously expository and defiantly incomprehensible.",
    "This dragon, sadly, is DOA."

I'm amazed that such a talented actor like Jeremy Irons hasnt managed to slip up yet- Dungeons and Dragons is yet another jem in his filmography crown........brilliant. I also loved the costumes- they didnt take themselves too seriously and the locations- although very low budget and tacky, blew my mind! If I had to nominate just one film to take the title of 'Film of the Decade' it would be 'Mortal Kombat Anihilation' but 'Dungeons and Dragons' would be a close second!- Awesome.",

I do think not only is it the worst fantasy movie I have ever seen, honestly Legend and Princess Bride were much better, but one of the worst movies ever made.The dialogue was inane and vomitSorry guys, I really didn't like this movie. I do think not only is it the worst fantasy movie I have ever seen, honestly Legend and Princess Bride were much better, but one of the worst movies ever made.The dialogue was inane and vomit inducing. In one part of the movie Snails says something along the lines of \"That is the riddlyiest thing I have ever heard\". Not only was that unfunny, but entirely out of place. The direction was off too, and the scenery was okay, but the camera-work was so flat and unfocused, it was barely a redeeming quality. And the plot was poor too, likewise with the special effects and you could drive a big tube train in some of the holes in the action.And the acting was atrocious. Jeremy Irons is a great actor, participating in fantastic films like Lion King and Reversal of Fortune. But as the villain in possibly the worst performance of his career, not helped by the terrible dialogue he was given, he chews the scenery to pieces, honestly the dreadful overacting puts someone like Tim Curry to shame. Marlon Wayans was cringe worthy, his humour was lame and in some cases unnecessary, and Justin Whalin; bland beyond bland. Unbearably wooden at times, and as the hero? Tom Cruise did better in Legend and he was the main flaw of that movie. Just for the record, I do think Legend has its flaws, but it is gorgeous to look at, and Tim Curry's Darkness was phenomenal, and should've got an award. Thora Birch acquits herself better, but her dialogue was poor, and I was thinking, is she a little too young for the part?Overall, terrible. You may like it, and I have no problem if you do, but as a die hard fantasy fan, I hated it. Watch Legend, Princess Bride or NeverEnding Story instead. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

I'm not making fun of if it actually did have a low budget or anything, but come on. The acting stank, the script stank, money put into CGI effects had been much too heavily invested into the wrong ones, and to top it all off, it was FAR off from the source material. The fact I even gave it a 1/10 is due to the *cough*fumes*cough laughing gas put off by this dung heap, and even there I am feeling like it being a bit too generous (fumes must be wearing off). I would say more, and even push into strong details, but it would be easier to simply tell you to look elsewhere if I have not convinced you of the scent it excreates.",

This is THE worst game to film adaptation of all time, bar none, and it's a genre filled with mediocre crap. There is no acting in this film. None. It's like a bunch of high school students set up a V-8 cam and did improv to a D&D campaign of their own device. The music is dull and generic. The special effects are as cheesy as anything I have ever seen in CGI. The plot just isn't there, it isn't there at all, likely hiding in shame in one of those dungeons the heroes never really visit.",

Acting on the whole is either very bad or too over the top (I?m looking at you Irons.) I will compliment the movie for at least trying to capture the Dungeon & Dragons atmosphere and lore, and to be fair some of the creature effects are pretty decent. Set design and wardrobe also pretty top notch too. But regardless, this movie is just a huge steaming pile of dog crap. A real shame as you can see that the production crew were trying.\r Overall:\rA real, real shame. From the set pieces to the effects team it could have been great. But such a putrid script and piss poor acting from the cast, it can not be saved. I can not even say that its so bad that its good. No, its not. Its just bad. Period!",

It should be awful but is hilarious entertaining instead. I wont blame anyone for a different opinion because it could be one of the worst (if not the worst) films of the year and it is not an advertisement for D&D. It should be noted that the director said that there was a lot of interference form investors / license holders and it should be mentioned that this was his first (big) movie. What makes this film so bad? The acting. All actors deliver a poor performance or are just stereotypes which is a shame because most if not all are acclaimed or at least performed better in other roles. I will admit that I like many parts of the character interactions. Jeremy Irons as antagonist delivers an over the top bad guy with is hilarious entertaining to watch. He would even be far too much for a James Bond villain. The other bad thing is that this movie uses all cliches, tropes and stereotypes that it could. If you play stereo type bingo you will run out of sheets ;-). The special effects are O.K. for me (Compared to the much earlier Jurassic Park they are garbage). Overall I consider it a guilty pleasure that I should have rated at most 3 /10 if it was not a “So good that it is bad” movie and hilariously entertaining.",
