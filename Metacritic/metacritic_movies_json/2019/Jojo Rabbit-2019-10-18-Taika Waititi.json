  "summary": "A lonely German boy's (Roman Griffin Davis as JoJo) world view is turned upside down when he discovers his single mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a young Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic. Aided only by his idiotic imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi), Jojo must confront his blind nationalism.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "A work of  sublime sweetness and beauty.",
    "Jojo Rabbit succeeds even with a high degree of difficulty, given the sensitivities of the subject matter, the emotional undercurrent of a mother’s devotion to her son and the breaking down of artificial walls to let love in. As much as it makes you laugh, Waititi’s must-watch effort is a warm hug of a movie that just so happens to have a lot of important things to say.",
    "Waititi infuses a level of humanity into WWII without blindly forgiving those responsible, nor hiding behind the guise of good guys in bad situations, or allowing even a 10-year-old boy to get away with hate without swift retribution and thorough self-examination.",
    "Waititi ... finds such strange, sweet humor in his storytelling that the movie somehow maintains its ballast, even when the tone inevitably (and it feels, necessarily) shifts.",
    "Waititi’s World War II satire is both a magic trick and a high-wire act – the filmmaker keeps pulling rabbits out of his hat while balancing comedy, kindness, and often shocking darkness. The end result is a heartfelt, sweet, blackly comedic coming-of-age journey that tries to find hope in hopeless times.",
    "Blazingly and brilliantly over the top, Jojo Rabbit’s total dismissal of subtlety is its most ferocious ally and, only occasionally, its most frustrating foe in the war against hate.",
    "Waititi masterfully balances the film’s comedy with the seriousness of the subject. He plays with your emotions to heighten the impact of the story’s message. Nothing in this film feels gratuitous and the tonal shift in the film will hit you like a ton of bricks.",
    "Absurdist humor abounds throughout a story whose underlying themes echo Elvis Costello’s eternal question, “What’s so funny ’bout peace, love, and understanding?” even as corpses dangle from a foregrounded gallows.",
    "This is either the worst time for a movie like Jojo Rabbit or the best time. I lean toward the latter. I’m perfectly willing to concede that the film may come across as gauche in the coming years, but in November 2019—as an irreverently comic middle finger to idiotic, irrational tribalism—wow, does it feel good.",
    "In the uncomfortably funny, unapologetically insensitive, cheerfully outrageous Jojo Rabbit, writer-director Waititi (“Thor: Ragnorak”) delivers a timely, anti-hate fractured fairy tale AND turns in hilarious work as Adolf Hitler, imaginary friend to a 10-year-old German boy near the end of World War II.",
    "Set to an anachronistic pop soundtrack and an eye-poppingly attractive production design that would be right at home in a Wes Anderson movie, this is a film that dares you not to enjoy its material pleasures, even as you wonder if you should be laughing quite so hard at the jokes.",
    "Strikes just the right balance between comedy, tragedy, and drama, the result being a very funny WWII film that nevertheless carries an incredibly important message about the here and now.",
    "A twisted piece of grandly entertaining provocation. ... This is a dark satire that finds a way to make a case for understanding.",
    "Waititi’s witty script and colorful supporting role as Adolf Hitler are the obvious comedic highlights of Jojo Rabbit. But the film only works because it manages to nail its balance of tones.",
    "Jojo Rabbit works such tensions throughout: between laughter and groans, between emotion and sentimentality, between daring and bad taste. Such gambles are worth taking even if you believe the gambler is headed for the breadline.",
    "Yes, the tone is a tricky balance that sometimes almost gets away from Waititi — there are some laugh-out-loud moments alongside some scenes of harrowing sadness. But for the most part, Waititi and the cast, which is uniformly excellent, manage to make it work.",
    "It’s Waititi’s ability to balance unassailably goofy moments with an acknowledgment of real-life horrors that makes the movie exceptional.",
    "Breathtakingly risky but valid under scrutiny ... Jojo Rabbit isn’t perfect; sometimes it strains to reconcile Waititi’s more relaxed beats (“Let everything happen to you,” is a line from poet Rainer Maria Rilke that gets big play) with his visual fussiness. But he’s legitimately breaking new ground. It will find an audience that gets it.",
    "As both director and performer, Waititi is on top form.",
    "Waititi adopts a tone that’s wild enough to accommodate all possibilities, so that even while we’re laughing, we’re in a state of anxiety.",
    "The reason Waititi’s films (yes, even “Thor: Ragnarok”) are so resonant is that they’ve always placed love and humanism at the heart of their humor. “Jojo,” despite going to some very dark places for its laughs, is no exception.",
    "Waititi injects enough heart and wit into this enterprise to make a case that artists like him should at least be trying to find creative ways to educate new generations about the horrors of the past.",
    "Jojo Rabbit excels with at least a sincerely attempted – if not exactly precise – balance of humour and horror, absurdity and tragedy.",
    "Neither the masterpiece nor the atrocity it will be described as from here on out by fans and critics alike, Jojo Rabbit is pretty funny, mostly fine, and (perhaps worst of all) well-made.",
    "You’ll laugh, you’ll cry — sometimes at the same time. But love or hate Jojo Rabbit, it’s damn near impossible to shake.",
    "The film is a little too sprightly to land any heavy punches — it’s more of a comedy with satirical elements than a true satirical tale. ... But hate can be both worthy of ridicule and deadly serious, and for the most part Jojo Rabbit manages to thread that needle.",
    "The problem with Waititi’s approach, not unlike those faced by Roberto Benigni 22 years ago when he made the divisive \"Life Is Beautiful,\" is perfecting the tonal shifts. His difficulties in this area can create a whiplash effect that results in the overall production feeling a little “off.”",
    "There’s no question this exuberantly directed coming-of-age tale — a peppy slapstick drama, if you can get your brain around that — is a sight to see. Whether you want to see it is something you may not be able to decide until halfway through.",
    "Johannson has never played a sweeter character on the screen, and she delivers an endearing performance.",
    "It’s far from the disaster it could have been given the tonal tightrope it walks, but it’s also closer to a misfire than we all hoped it would be. Believe it or not, the “Hitler Comedy” plays it too safe.",
    "I suspect the strangely good-natured feel of the film will win the hearts of many viewers, but my own head remained too muddled by its uneven and oddly indecisive approach to embrace whatever quirky virtues it may possess.",
    "Taika Waititi’s most daring film isn’t his most successful. But among the tonal clashes there’s real hope, humanity, and no-bones-about-it Nazi-bashing at a time when that’s depressingly necessary.",
    "It’s no surprise that the film should so often stumble and trip, yet I would sooner watch it again and sort through my mixed feelings about it than revisit, say, the nullity of “Joker.” There is genuine zest in the unease of Jojo Rabbit, and it’s weirdly convincing as a portrait of childhood under surreal strain.",
    "Let me add something in the movie’s favor. Although I don’t love Jojo Rabbit, I love that it exists.",
    "The humor is so audacious and the psychological insight at times so startling that it’s hard not to be dismayed when an easy and familiar dose of comfort is supplied at the end. This “Rabbit” is maybe just a little too cute, and a little too friendly.",
    "Jojo Rabbit’s script isn’t emotionally complex enough to address the cruel realism of its world, and as the bleakness continues, the jokes fall flatter and flatter.",
    "Erratic but engaging, going in and out of daring, the film’s mixture of black humor and unashamed sentimentality is not always as good as its best parts.",
    "Though it dabbles with the horror of the Third Reich it never examines their worst atrocities ...  And that perhaps, is too careless in today’s world of a rising far right and stealth dictatorships. But if you’re looking for giddy escapism, Bowie tunes and an unapologetic good time with a side order of remembrance for of WW2, then you’ll have as much fun as the cast clearly had making this.",
    "It’s like a Wes Anderson movie set during the Third Reich. ... And yet it’s not as if it’s a terrible movie; it’s actually a studiously conventional movie dressed up in the self-congratulatory “daring” of its look!-let’s-prank-the-Nazis cachet.",
    "Waititi spends so much energy trying to convince us that this story is universal that he often loses what made it novel in the first place.",
    "Jojo Rabbit, a very nice but thin crowd-pleaser about love conquering all, bills itself as an “anti-hate satire.” But true satire challenges and provokes. This one offers free hugs.",
    "In the early going, though, Waititi manages to keep the tone light and the humor surreal enough to avoid too much association with the real world. But as his story devolves into melodrama, the comedy curdles.",
    "At the end of Jojo Rabbit, you’re just left wondering what the point of it all was.",
    "It’s a well-meaning idea that never quite succeeds on the levels of either comedy or drama. Call it a noble failure.",
    "An awkward, uneven film, with writer-director Taika Waititi conjuring some touching moments, but unable to pull off the magic act this \"Rabbit\" trick requires.",
    "The cartoonishness of it, while amusing at the outset, doesn’t wear well as matters deepen and progress.",
    "Yes, Waititi’s sugary fantasy unearths an endearing quality in the most unlikely places. But in the process, it buries the awful truth.",
    "Jojo Rabbit has little to say about any of the things it dredges up, beyond the obvious.",
    "It’s oddly safe, given the subject matter, and the humour is similarly sanitised. What Waititi thinks is shockingly audacious is in fact frustratingly timid, he opts for a gentle prod when maybe a punch would do.",
    "Jojo Rabbit doesn’t lack for ambition or sincerity of purpose — which only makes it more disappointing that the film proves to be so meagre. ... Rather than being bracing or dangerous, this comedy ends up feeling a little too safe, a little too scattered, and a little too inconsequential.",
    "Taika Waititi’s self-proclaimed “anti-hate satire” “Jojo Rabbit” exists in service of a single idea, a notion so desperately idealistic that it lands somewhere between naïveté and disingenuousness.",
    "Even though the target of satire in Jojo Rabbit is clearly the Nazis, the movie sharply but unintentionally satirizes itself, as well as its makers and the movie industry at large that saw fit to produce, release, and acclaim it.",
    "There are no insights to be had – and no laughs.",
    "As satire it’s a dismal dereliction of duty; as comedy, a one-note joke that wears out fast.",
    "Its so-called audacity smacks of calculation and emotional cowardice.",
    "The film doesn’t lack for audacity, or ultimate purpose — it’s against hate and in favor of love. But the adaptation isn’t funny enough to sustain the style, which owes an overt debt to Mel Brooks and amounts to Springtime for Hitler Youth.",
    "Waititi is incapable of dealing with the twin horrors of oppression and indoctrination beyond cheap-seats sentimentality and joke-making."

I think it is fair to say that it was NOT what they were expecting. This is likely one of the reasons for some of the negative reviews.  This movie is ambitious. It draws you in with what you expect to be fully satirical slap-stickish humor and then rudely wakes you up to the realities of war, prejudice, and fanaticism. The movie triggered the full spectrum of emotions from goofy happiness, to anger, to love of many forms, to shock, sadness, anxiety, and finally uncertain joy.  The success of the movie, and its innocent goofiness, comes from the fact that it is ENTIRELY presented from the perspective of a 10 year old boy. A boy forced to deal with the horrors and glamour of war at the same time that he is dealing with the normal hardships of growing up, like any of us.  While we can relate to some of his experiences, the backdrop of his reality amplifies the circumstances and consequences of his actions and experiences. The story telling, though at times imperfect, is ultimately successful because of the amazing performances of the cast and the honesty and value of the message being conveyed. The boys did not get the movie they were expecting but instead were treated to a film which challenged their beliefs, expanded their thinking a bit, an triggered great conversations. They loved it.",

It follows a young Nazi-raised boy by the name of Jojo and his upbringing and various misadventures in war-torn Germany, all alongside his mother (Scarlett Johansson), a young Jewish girl he discovers in hiding (Thomasin McKenzie), and his imaginary friend who happens to be a much sillier version of Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi, who also directs the film.) Throughout much of the film's runtime, it gave me some serious Wes Anderson vibes, what with it's quirky and bizarre nature, eccentric characters, and offbeat dialogue and jokes. Unfortunately, it's these jokes that hindered the film's potential for me. Just about all of them fell rather flat to me personally, and a surprising amount of them felt really dragged out and in slightly bad taste too. All of the actors, which also included the likes of Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson, are given great opportunities to shine and a fair amount of screentime, but I simply felt as though their talents were undermined by the film's flimsy premise and story. Overall, it made a decent effort, but not only did it feel like a Wes Anderson wannabe, I simply found it rather forgettable and subpar in terms of its attempts at dark humor, especially when looking at something as risque as jokes about Nazis and anti-Semitism during WWII.",

She's kind. She treats me like a person.\"Taika Waititi is on a roll recently and rightfully so, because he's got a great comedic vision.'Jojo Rabbit' is a World War II satire that's both hilarious and surprisingly tragic. Joy, terror, love, hate all in one movie. Waititi knows how far to take a joke and how humor can put on light on ugly issues. While absurd looking on the surface, but on a deeper look it's something unique.Newcomers Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie take center stage upon the big cast. Their comedic timing, emotional range and overall performances are nothing short than impressive. Also Archie Yates is like the adorable child version of Nick Frost.Speaking of big name stars. Scarlett Johansson is having a fantastic year and she once again delivers a wonderful performance. Sam Rockwell is amazing in pretty much anything he's in and here is no different. Rockwell playing a closeted homosexual Nazi is hysterical, and yet meaningful when you look at it more thoughtfully.The weakest actor upon the cast has to be Rebel Wilson. I really didn't buy her as this character. I thought she's just doing her usual comedic traits like in every other movie, which I'm not a fan of.Not only is Taika Waititi directing and writing, but also starring as Jojo's imaginary friend of his very own idol... Adolf Hitler. Apparently Waititi didn't have to research playing Hitler, because he thought Adolf was 'a f**ing c***'. Anywhere, the concept itself is really bizarre and really fascinating. While silly and entertaining, but could've been left out, in my opinion. There was a point where he completely disappears from the movie to later reappear during the finale.At times I feel like it tries hard to be like a Wes Anderson movie, in terms of staging, quirky humor, and overall setting. Influence is one thing, but it came a point when it wasn't being it's own thing.Overall rating: Criticisms aside, I had an absolute blast. Endearing and highly vocal.

It manages to work and I don't thinkMaking fun of Nazi Germany is a double-edged sword, after all it serves as a satire but you also can't forget the horrors that happened back then.Jojo Rabbit swings between satire and a feel-good story. It manages to work and I don't think it was insulting. Written and directed by Taika Waititi, Jojo Rabbit is a movie that certainly borrows a lot from Wes Anderson. The opening sequence is more than evident and although that may be considered problematic for some, Waititi manages to emerge gracefully from the evident comparisons, though with its obvious ups and downs.Another point to emphasize is that you will enter the world of the movie or you will not and personally I think that depends a lot on whether you'll enjoy the movie or not.There's moments where I couldn't help feeling the film stretches a lot the absurdity, but once again Waititi manages to recover enough the pace so that things don't get out of hand.While not all jokes land and honestly the movie is never as funny as it thinks it is, passing the bumps, Jojo Rabbit shows the heart of its narrative that is the friendship between Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) and Elsa (Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie), the young Jew girl that her mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding in their home.This is essential because Jojo being the main character and obviously the narrative driver only knows what he has learned so far, what they instructed him and is that the Jews are vermin therefore his growth as a character and evidently as a person lies in that plot point although obviously that's where the failure of the story lies because at this point that's not something that is no longer known or needs to be learned, perhaps it should be emphasized but not only towards the Jews but towards the whole world in general considering that kids today continue to be feed with that kind of hate.Jojo Rabbit is a conventional film but it stands out for its style and it's an honest story, as honest as its plot can provide. It's nothing special but personally I had a good time watching it and that is also what cinema is about.",

This movie is'nt just trying to get some laughs out of tragic events, but as well make fun of how stupid humanity can be sometimes. Some critics giving this movie implications like \"What is the point?\" Reminding even the same kind of critics Roberto Benigni's La vita è bella got for getting some humor out of this dark period of human history, hence completely missing the core of that movie which was positivity of hope for the future. And talking about Jojo Rabbit, though it really doesn't have anything too philosophical to say, it delivers what you sign up for: Having a good time and hope for the future!But of course it's not flawless by any means, there are some insinuations for romances here and there that do not get really to some point in the end. Some character motivationes, that may seem merely plain or somehow unexplained, can get the overall perception that secondary characters have in fact little care, with one very specific exception in the very end of the movie. Sometimes the plot can feel a tiny bit dragged or feeling like you have to wait a little bit for that important thing to happen.Now let's get the great parts on the table. The performances from the younger actors are really on point, and across the board the perfomances of the main characters are great, highlighting Waititis funny performance as Hitler and the realtion between each character with Jojo in a natural and realistic way. Scarlet Johansson can get from really funny to really compelling quite smoothelly, but on one very specific moment that was meant to be really sad and shocking, can actually get a little off putting or with misunderstood feelings that you may forget after 5 minutes; and that can be a problem, ther are very emotional events here and there that can get you on the edge of heartbreaking so to get back to the general feeling of comedy they appeal to use, although very comical, out of nowhere jokes which can be annoying for some people.And the best part of this movie, the feeling of hope and opportunity for the future that it reamins on one's mind for very long. It really pays off in the end as a movie which has something to say in a very heart warming way, something that can go around the sentiment of keep going 'cause it gets better.",

JojoFirst off, I'd like to address to what seems to be a common criticism in the other reviews. the impression of Hitler is goofy and in a way reminds me of mr. bean, however this is only how Jojo (our young protagonist) perceives him. Jojo idolises Hitler and has him as his imaginary friend so its only logical that a child sees his imaginary friend as child-like thus, the directors/ writers arent in any way saying the real Hitler was anything like how Jojo imagines him to be, they just made the imaginary version of him mirrors the boy which by the way was very comedic and well done  as for the rest of my review, Jojo rabbit is supurb, every character is believable and most are actually likeable which is a nice breath of fresh air when it comes to nazi movies. the film does a great job at showing not all nazis were crazy killing machines that believed in the aryan race concept(but its definitely talked about in the movie) and humanizes them greatly. it pulls heart strings effectively and takes on a good deal of themes and doesnt suffer for it  8/10 film, would see again",

He’s a 10 year-old, Hitler Youth with Adolf as an imaginary friend. Does he understand what it all means? Or, does he really just want to play dress up and be a part of a club, as is suggested by one of the other characters. How does a 10 year old navigate this complicated and dangerous world? Jojo Rabbit explores these themes and more through a delicate balance of satire and drama. Taika Waititi wrote and directed Jojo Rabbit, which is based on a novel by Christine Leunens called Caging Skies; and he brings his special brand of boffo comedy – even portraying Jojo’s imaginary confidante, Adolf. It’s both wacky and serious. Sometimes it is both within the span of minutes.I have had a difficult time digesting Jojo Rabbit because I wanted it to be more impactful to me than I felt it was. It’s a coming of age story with many of the tropes that a coming of age story has. Jojo is destined to learn a lesson. On the other hand, Waititi, as writer, director and cast member, has a strong point of view about lampooning the ridiculousness of Nazism and through his brand of humor dismantles other hate-filled ideologies. In that way, the film is novel and a worthy viewing. The whole thing can be disorienting, which may take some audience members out of the overall experience of the film.Roman Griffin Davis plays Jojo. This kid is great. He has the weight of this sometimes silly and sometimes very serious movie on his shoulders. Through the eyes of this child, we see and question war, ideology, love and loss. Davis always seems appropriately in tune with his character. There are other great performances by Scarlett Johansson as Jojo’s mother and Thomasin McKenzie as the mysterious stranger Jojo develops a relationship with. I’ll say that Waititi’s Adolf is very impactful in his brief scenes; and there’s a hilarious and threatening cameo by Stephen Merchant. The only out of place and unnecessary cast member is Rebel Wilson, which is true of most of the roles she’s portrayed. No offense to you, Ms. Wilson.Overall, Jojo Rabbit is a good movie that should be seen. It will not be what you expect. The balance of comedy and drama achieved by Waititi didn’t always work to me. If you are not calibrated to this satirical tone, then you may not enjoy Jojo’s ride. I say proceed to the theater with caution.",

Positing that the firstA hilarious piece of political satire that isn't afraid to be seriousBased loosely on the 2004 novel Caging Skies by Christine Leunens, Jojo Rabbit is a political satire written and directed by Taika Waititi. Positing that the first casualty of indoctrination is objective truth, Waititi follows in the footsteps of filmmakers such as Charlie Chaplin (The Great Dictator), Mel Brooks (The Producers), Roberto Benigni (La vita è bella), and even Quentin Tarantino (Inglorious Basterds), in attempting to defang Nazi ideology by rendering it utterly absurd. Marketed as an \"anti-hate satire\", the film has no easy task – to use Nazism as the (mostly) humorous background to what is essentially a bildungsroman, without it seeming exploitative or dismissive. And Waititi manages this tricky balancing act exceptionally well. The satire and slapstick elements are as funny as anything in his filmography, and the film's more serious moments (of which there are several) arrive like an absolute gut-punch.Großdeutsches Reich, 1945. In the fictional town of Falkenhem, ten-year-old Jojo Betzler (an astonishing debut by Roman Griffin Davis) lives with his whimsical mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson doing probably the best work of her career) and his imaginary best friend - none other than Hitler himself (a ludicrously over the top Waititi), or at least Jojo's conception of Hitler. Believing absolutely in his duty to the state, Jojo attends a Hitlerjugend camp run by the cynical Cpt. Klenzendorf (a powerful performance by Sam Rockwell that was outrageously ignored by the Academy), who was forced to leave the front line upon losing an eye. However, the overzealous Jojo is injured and forced to return home. At which point, he discovers his mother has been hiding a young Jewish girl, Elsa Korr (a nuanced performance from Thomasin McKenzie), in a crawlspace.The film mixes slapstick humour, caricature, satire, dramatic irony, and hope, but never does it seem like its ignoring or trivialising real suffering - when the comedy is dropped and Waititi gets serious, the tonal shifts pack a shocking punch. Crucially important to the film's tonal qualities are director of photography Mihai Mălaimare, Jr.'s bright, colourful palette and Ra Vincent's whimsical production design. Together, they speak to the fact that this is Jojo's worldview rather than objective reality, with the look of the film reminding me a great deal of The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). It sure doesn't look like any World War II movie you're ever likely to have seen.Thematically, the film examines multiple issues; the devotion of motherhood, the importance of kindness in defeating indoctrination, the disconnect between unchallenged ideology and complex reality, the predetermined attitudinal stance towards the Other, the clash between doing what one knows to be right and what one is expected to do. Klenzendorf's arc is especially telling in this respect. Introduced as a hyperbolic caricature, the source of some of the film's biggest early laughs, as things progress, we realise there's considerably more to his character, and he commands what's easily the most moving scene in the whole film. This is Jojo's story, however, with much of the runtime concerned with his attempts to rationalise the cognitive dissonance between what he's been taught and what he can see with his own eyes.Of course, although set in 1945, Jojo Rabbit is really about today, as it mocks political extremism, particularly people who hate based on ethnicity or religion. Jojo's belief that Jews are demonic figures capable of powerful magic stands in for people who believe all Muslims are terrorists or all Mexicans are rapists. In this sense, the film is partly about the role adults play in inculcating children into hate and partly about exposing the power of propaganda to subvert truth. But so too is it about rising above such ideology, no matter how ingrained it might be. And although all of this is presented humorously, it never becomes didactic or monolithically preachy – Waititi balances his tones too well.Of course, Waititi does gloss over some of the more horrific atrocities carried out during the War. The Nazis in the film are, by design, cartoonish, although that is done so as to render them as easily dismissed. The reality, of course, was far darker, and it wouldn't have hurt to have at least one Nazi who isn't a figure of fun. In this sense, the film doesn't represent the awful truth, but it never claims to.Jojo Rabbit is beautiful, emotional, heartfelt, and devastating, but mostly hilarious and always hopeful. It's an extraordinarily sweet film without ever becoming saccharine, as Waititi strikes a perfect balance between comedy, tragedy, and drama. It's a very funny World War II film which imparts a vital message for our confused and divided world of today – if we let them, love will always trump hate, hope will always light a way through the darkness.",

Sure, they have solid help from a stellar supporting cast which elevates the leads, but without them, it wouldn’t play half as well and certainly would fail to deliver on the more sensitive and serious moments which are the film’s real surprises.",

It's well shot, mostly very well acted (accents aside), and the writing really impressed me. My first reaction to the film was that nothing was subtle, but nothing was trying to be subtle, and it sorta worked. As the film progressed, though, it was clear that there was a lot more subtle moments of genuine care than expected, and even a lot of the humor was moving to lines that sorta took the audience a few seconds before it clicked and we laughed. Is it the film of the year? No. Does it do what it set out to do? Everything and more, I think. As a Jewish man, I've long held that Life is Beautiful is the only film that has gone for any laughs about the holocaust in any shape or form that worked, but that maybe a movie with enough thought and talent in writing could do the same someday. I just never thought that film needed to exist, and I especially never thought it would come from the Thor 3 guy. This movie is no Life is Beautiful, but it hit the marks it needed to, I think.",

Writer/Director Taika Waititi doesn’t.The premise of this film is unique.  Ten-year-old JoJo (Roman Griffin Davis in his professional debut) and his mother live in 1940’s Vienna near the end of World War II.  JoJo’s best friend is an imaginary, wildly inaccurate Adolf Hitler (played by Waititi).  Early on, JoJo eagerly anticipates a weekend of camping, indoctrination and adventure with the other Hitler Youth.  But as the film moves along, his blissfully rabid world view begins to come unhinged when he discovers the Jewish girl his mother is hiding in the attic.This film’s greatest asset is its mastery of shifting tones.  Initially, it trades in broad, slapstick humor.  JoJo’s adoration of Hitler and all he stands for is offered as a hilarious example of the blind idolatry one can only hope is unique to ten-year-olds.  By Act Two, the tone begins to shift and the horrors all around JoJo start to slide into focus.  In one scene, JoJo and his mother are walking through the town square when several sets of dangling legs appear in the foreground.  When JoJo asks, “What did they do?” his mother replies softly, “What they could.” By Act Three, the brutality of WW II is on full display, with the film taking on a full-blown (pun intended), serious anti-war tone.Another great reason to see this film is the supporting cast.  Nobody does crazy better than Sam Rockwell (“Seven Psychopaths,” “Three Billboards…”).  Here, Rockwell is in full manic mode, exhibiting a blustering braggadocio totally unsupported by reality, a skill he has perfected over several films.  As JoJo’s mother, Scarlett Johansson is so compelling and such a sympathetic character that love between mother and son eventually becomes one of the dominant themes of the film.  Steven Merchant and Rebel Wilson add additional support. As the girl in the attic, New Zealand-born Thomasin McKenzie conveys a world-weary kindness one would expect from a person much older than her nineteen years.In its juxtaposition of slapstick humor with Nazi horrors, “JoJo Rabbit” treads some of the same ground explored in 2017’s equally excellent “The Death of Stalin.”  Both films play for laughs that carry an undertone of dread.  But this film clearly has its own points to make about the insanity of blind devotion and about the risks of unthinking tribalism.“JoJo Rabbit” excels by drawing the viewer in with its initial humor, then using the built-up good will to provoke serious personal thought and reflection.  In so doing, it solidifies Taika Waititi’s reputation as a thoughtful provocateur.  Overall, this is one of the best films of the year.",

This is a movie with heart, and we need movies with heart nowThe latest offering from Taika Waititi is thought provoking, hilarious, and heart-breaking. This movie has such a strong, compelling, artistic vision that it never wavers from. This is a movie with heart, and we need movies with heart now more than ever.Without going into any spoiler territory, the best way I can describe the vision of Jojo Rabbit is this: Imagine if Wes Anderson directed a mashup of Thor Ragnarok and The Boy In the Striped Pajamas. It's sound absolutely crazy, but Waititi manages to pull it off with exceptional grace. The soundtrack, which is loaded with Beatles songs and David Bowie anthems, is a leaf right out of Wes Anderson's book. Also inspired by Wes Anderson is Waititi's shot composition of incredibly symmetrical images, visual metaphors and foreshadowing, and a vibrant pastel color palette. The humor and character development in the film is classic Waititi. Waititi himself plays a well thought out caricature of Hitler who always gives terrible advice, and is struggling to mask the evil that hides beneath the surface. Thomasin MacKenzie is absolutely brilliant, as is our main character, Jojo, played by Roman Griffin Davis. Sam Rockwell is surprisingly touching as a sympathetic Nazi. Scarlett Johansson's performance will not leave a dry eye in the house. Other performances of note are Stephen Merchant's terrifyingly hilarious take on a Gestapo officer, and Archie Yates as Yorki, Jojo's happy go lucky best friend.While billed as a comedy, this movie is definitely a drama. There is no doubt about that. The film doesn't shy away from the horrors of WWII, and when the emotional punches start coming, they just don't stop. A lot like the real WWII, things get way worse before they get better.There wasn't a whole lot I didn't like about Jojo Rabbit. Occasionally, some moments drag out a little too long. Also, the very last shot of the movie is a little unnecessary. However, Jojo Rabbit is a beautiful, emotional rollercoaster of a film. It asks daring questions about the human soul, and it does provide some good laughs. Definitely check this one out.",

Writer-director Taika Waititi takes quite a chance with this comical coming of age story, walking a fine line between evoking laughs while addressing serious subjects, a mix that hits some notes and misses others. The picture's best assets -- its strong start and finish, an excellent Wes Anderson-esque production design, and excellent performances by Roman Griffin Davis as the befuddled youth and Waititi as an imaginary friend version of the Fuhrer -- unfortunately are undercut by a drawn-out, meandering middle that stymies the picture's momentum and detracts from its strengths.

Amidst all the controversies and debates that the film has been provoking, you know then and there that the film works. Filmmaking is one slippery sand in your hand. You are told to define the filmmaking in the most textbook format. The definition asks for you to follow certain rules along with elements, proper stages with enough room and objectives that are obligatory. And this is how it is measured. Now, one would always argue then, why doesn't everyone gets it right. Well, one's an idiot. Because there is no textbook out there. So what you are referring to, what your source is, is your instinct.You must have a sophisticated skillful way of turning the heads of the viewers. Tilting with wonder? Why not. And you can deny and argue as much as you like but Taika in its absurdity and contradictory method, wins your heart with a charming and delightful \"small talks\". If it makes you cry, it made you feel something. If you're laughing, then you are. The \"experience\" factor of the film could not be more clear.Taika's Jojo Rabbit is rabbit-alike. My family has just adopted a rabbit. So all I see is it. But the adorable looks or tone of the film overcomes its undermining and often questioning themes. The film repeatedly skips the \"homework\" aspect of the narration to zap you with an emotional dose. There are so many things wrong with it. But then, the premise itself asks for it. And no, I am not pointing towards the old Hitler routine, the elephant in the room. But what goes behind those frames. There are some unearthly images enacted in the film to exaggerate the underlined lunacy where all these acts were leading towards.",

Jojo Rabbit is one hell of an emotional roller-coaster and tonally a bit all over the place which will leave most of you an emotional wreck by the time the credits roll.Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) is dead set on becoming a member of the Hitler Youth during the last years of WWII. When he finds a Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) hiding in his home he becomes caught between his moral conscience and his blind nationalism. You’ll be laughing one minute and nearly in tears the next. Jojo Rabbit has more than a few tear-jerking moments, yet the mood will quickly change any time Taika Waititi appears on screen as Adolf Hitler. Yes you read that right, Waititi portrays Jojo’s imaginary friend Hitler. I don’t believe any other person could have gotten away with that and on paper it sounds very strange but trust me on this, it works. It just about finds the balance between political satire and a moving story. Yes it’s a little outrageous at times but the acting from the entire cast is absolutely exceptional. Scarlett Johansson as Jojo’s mother and Sam Rockwell as Captain Klenzendorf give a standout performance, but it’s Roman Griffin Davis who really shines through. A very impressive debut, I don’t know where they found him but I’m sure he has a very successful career ahead of him. I loved JoJo Rabbit, it’s shocking, funny and well worth the ticket price.

Sure it's not everyone's cup of tea. But whether or not you feel the subject is film-worthy, this is a dead film. As was the audience at my screening.",

It was billed as a satire on Nazism, and it tried to make the training of Hitler Youth funny; but it failed spectacularly.It did not even work as an illustration of the senselessness of war, the despicableness of anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry, or the horror of socialist totalitarianism.I drove 40 minutes to see it because some critics seemed to believe it was Oscar-worthy.

TheThe idea of making an absurd movie about WWII is not new.\"Life is Beautiful\" comes to mind.But a comedy? Really? Of WWII? In theory I think everything is possible but it would require tremendous talent. I haven't seen it in this movie. The director is definitely not without talent but it's not nearly enough to turn a farce into a drama.Or may be I am too old.There were a few amusing episodes and a few funny jokes. Overall the movie felt flat and somewhat ridiculous, as if you come to an amusement park. I guess horrors of World Wars are being erased from our minds as a society.Amusement parks are immensely popular. I am sure many people will find this movie great.",
