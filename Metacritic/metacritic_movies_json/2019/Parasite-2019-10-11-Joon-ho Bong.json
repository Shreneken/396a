And the Kim Family, rich in street smarts but not much else. Be it chance or fate, these two houses are brought together and the Kims sense a golden opportunity. Masterminded by college-aged Ki-woo, the Kim children expediently install themselves as tutor and art therapist, to the Parks. Soon, a symbiotic relationship forms between the two families. The Kims provide “indispensable” luxury services while the Parks obliviously bankroll their entire household.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "Thrillingly played by a flawless ensemble cast who hit every note and harmonic resonance of Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won’s multitonal script, it’s a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul.",
    "Bong has once more proved what an exciting filmmaker he is, and Parasite is strong contender for Oscar Best Picture.",
    "Parasite is quite simply a supreme feat of film-making, a tense and hilarious jewel box of a film that draws you deeper and deeper into its wicked, absurdist satire.",
    "A miracle of a film. It feels like Bong Joon-ho’s already extraordinary career has been building to this: a riotous social satire that’s as gloriously entertaining as it is deeply sardonic.",
    "This is a film of such dramatic power and innovative comedy and romantic poetry and melancholy beauty that upon exiting a screening, you might well feel the urge to tell everyone in the lobby of the multiplex to delay their plans to check out some mainstream offering because if they truly love cinema, they should see THIS movie, immediately.",
    "With Parasite [Bong] transcends genre even as he sharpens his social satire skills, delivering a movie that will resonate from Seoul to Syracuse, Helsinki to Hong Kong, one of the great films of 2019.",
    "Nothing is off the table when your status is threatened, no matter what your station in life. Parasite explores this in stunning fashion.",
    "Every typical category of film analysis – the performances, the cinematography, the score, the wit, so on and so forth – needn’t be labeled as anything less than great.",
    "You’ll watch knowing you’re in the hands of a master filmmaker; only wondering when it’s over how certain effects were achieved.",
    "Parasite becomes a social satire of almost breathless audacity, a three-dimensional chess game of Darwinian one-upmanship that is by turns hilarious, terrifying, and brutal.",
    "As entertained as the audience is throughout, you don’t leave the theatre undisturbed.",
    "Like Jordan Peele’s “Get Out,” Bong’s Parasite expresses consequential ideas that matter to the filmmaker about the way we live today, and the prejudice and malice we create for ourselves and others. The best social satires, like this one, dwell in the underworld where the sinister, the sobering and the bitterly funny swirl in the same stream of consciousness.",
    "Parasite, Bong Joon-ho’s latest masterpiece and the best film I’ve seen so far this year, is about two families of four at opposite ends of the economic spectrum, and how the one on the lower end systematically takes over the lives of the other.",
    "With Parasite, Bong’s finest work to date, the 50-year-old director clearly articulates a throughline that has been present in all his previous work: there’s no war but the class war.",
    "Parasite won the top prize at Cannes, and it’s South Korea’s entry for the Best International Feature Film Oscar. There are good reasons why it’s poised to resonate worldwide. It tells a story you could probably follow without subtitles, or any dialogue at all: the faces of these actors show with piercing clarity how it feels to be outsiders in a world of wealth and privilege.",
    "Parasite, maybe the best film Bong has yet made, begins as a social-realist drama about a poor family struggling to find work in modern-day Seoul. By the end of its brisk two hours and 11 minutes, it will have cycled through black comedy, social satire, suspense, and slapstick.",
    "The story begins as a social satire of rich and poor, as witty and sophisticated in its fashion as vintage Preston Sturges or Ernst Lubitsch. Remarkably, though, it gets funnier as it grows more serious, then savagely funny and finally…but we mustn’t get ahead of a movie that stays ahead of its audience every frame of the way.",
    "Bong’s command of the medium is thrilling. He likes to move the camera, sometimes just to nudge your attention from where you think it should be, but always in concert with his restlessly inventive staging.",
    "This dark, socially conscious film about the intertwining of two families is an intricately plotted, adult thriller. We can go up, for sure, but Bong can also take us deeper down. There’s always an extra floor somewhere in this masterpiece.",
    "Few filmmakers can manage such a dizzying blend of tones, but for Bong, one of South Korea’s finest directors, it’s a trademark. With Parasite he’s crafted his best movie yet.",
    "Parasite is an unpredictable, thought-provoking masterpiece about inequality.",
    "The humanity on screen might be messy, but the skill with which it’s portrayed never is.",
    "An exhilarating and furious indictment of class struggle, Parasite might be the masterpiece South Korea's Bong Joon-ho has been working toward his entire career.",
    "Parasite is unquestionably one of the best films of the year. Just trust me on this one.",
    "It’s extremely moving and thrilling and it will both make and ruin your day.",
    "It’s rare for a movie to combine cinematic fireworks and social commentary in quite the thrilling and mischievous way that Korean director Bong Joon-ho manages with Parasite.",
    "Parasite begins in exhilaration and ends in devastation, but the triumph of the movie is that it fully lives and breathes at every moment, even when you might find yourself struggling to exhale.",
    "A raucous and blood-splattered social satire.",
    "A masterful dissection of social inequality and the psychology of money.",
    "It’s a heartbreaking tale of why the haves and have-nots will stay that way, crafted by a virtuoso director at the very top of his game.",
    "A serrating, brilliantly stylized portrait of class and fate and family in modern-day Korea.",
    "Parasite doesn’t attempt to solve the world’s problems, or even to entirely explain them. It’s a woolly meditation from one of our woolliest meditators. Bong Joon-ho cements his place as one of the greats.",
    "Bong is perhaps the contemporary master of entertaining, intelligent and resolutely political cinema. In our age of assembly line blockbusters, he’s a veritable treasure.",
    "Parasite isn’t just thrillingly unpredictable. It pivots with purpose, the class politics setting the trajectory.",
    "[A] furious and fiendishly well-crafted new film. ... Giddy one moment, unbearably tense the next, and always so entertaining and fine-tuned that you don’t even notice when it’s changing gears, “Parasite” takes all of the beats you expect to find in a Bong film and shrinks them down with clockwork precision.",
    "Bong, in short, is a merchant of stealth. There is no more frenzy in the editing of Parasite than there are shudders in the motion of the camera, and, as with Hitchcock, such feline prowling toys with us and claws us into complicity with deeds that we might otherwise fear or scorn.",
    "Parasites is a brilliant film and for a thriller, it’s absolutely unpredictable (except in one big way).",
    "The movie dissects the universal gap between the haves and the have-nots with shocking wit, stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence. It’s explosive filmmaking on every level.",
    "There’s an anger at work in the film, but what’s more effective is its ruefulness—its ribbons of abiding hope, frayed and tattered but still there, somehow.",
    "Parasite is a malign delight from start to finish, with a Machiavellian sense of mischief and a cinematic brio that shows Bong revelling in his Hitchcockian control of somewhat Buñuelian material.",
    "Bong delivers a stunning return to form with this newest venture, which takes bold leaps between tenors and tone, but holds together beautifully thanks to the director’s unparalleled visual/spatial sophistication, and his unsparing social indictment.",
    "Bong is back and on brilliant form, but he is unmistakably, roaringly furious, and it registers because the target is so deserving, so enormous, so 2019: Parasite is a tick fat with the bitter blood of class rage.",
    "In a year when the coy social mores of upstairs and downstairs have been filtered once again through the aristocratic monocle of \"Downton Abbey,\" it's a relief that there's a film this year that tackles the servant/master relationship with the straight-for-the-jugular malice of Parasite.",
    "The film surprises with its narrative twists and turns, making the overall trajectory unexpected and the endpoint different from anything one might have expected at the beginning.",
    "The genius is in the way the movie’s little details and character touches lead to an absolutely bonkers climax—after a shocking twist I won’t reveal—that nevertheless feels inevitable.",
    "In a masterful bit of cinematic sleight of hand, Bong, the writer and director behind 2013’s \"Snowpiercer\" and 2017’s \"Okja,\" harnesses the precise anxieties everyone of us is currently sharing — top of that list, the growing income gap and the crumbling planet — and uses them to make every scene in this blackhearted comic thriller crackle with energy and purpose.",
    "The latest excellent effort for writer/director Bong Joon-ho (“The Host,” “Okja”) is a more entertaining version of “Roma,” an Oscar-ready, slice-of-life foreign film that challenges its audience to look inward.",
    "Even through its absurdist, bleakly satirical lens, Bong understands that social inequity is not just theatre, but lived experience.",
    "A luxuriously watchable and satirical suspense drama.",
    "The only thing that keeps Parasite just slightly below the tier of Bong’s best work, namely The Host and his underrated and similarly themed 2000 debut film, Barking Dogs Never Bite, is the overstuffed pile-up of incident that occurs toward the end.",
    "A demented and often-uproarious class-conscious satire, Parasite falls slightly short of Bong’s greatest work.",
    "Like much of Bong’s work, Parasite is cumbersomely plotted and heavy-handed in its social commentary. The largely naturalistic treatment here may also alienate some of his fantasy fanboy constituency. That said, this prickly contemporary drama still feels more coherent and tonally assured than Snowpiercer or Okja, and packs a timely punch that will resonate in our financially tough, politically polarized times."

Seems like a lot in 2 hours, but not only is the message of class division clear, Bong presents it in the most accessible and humorous way while being able to shock his viewer; and everything from the performance of the cast, to the script, to the cinematography and to the production is flawless and jaw dropping.Calling it a great movie is an understatement. Bong has created a masterpiece and what could possibly his best film so far. Go watch the movie as soon as possible. If you love cinema, this is one movie you have to watch. It will leave you speechless at the end.",

I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. The film’s message is a little on the nose but I don’t have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. Other than that, this film is perfect. There is not one bad performance in the movie. Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, and Kang-Ho Song are standouts from the film. All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film’s slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film’s story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It’s so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it’s always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I’m using the word tension a lot but that’s what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose.",

I don't know whether to consider it a comedy, drama, thriller, dark comedy, etc., as it contains so many elements of all these genres. One thing I do know is certain though, this is such an interesting and unbelievable film in virtually every way possible! Winner of the Palme d'Or (the French equivalent of an Academy Award) earlier this year at the Cannes Film Festival, this film follows a poor Korean family that attempts to insert themselves into the lives of a rich, upper-class suburban family by getting themselves hired for various jobs for the family, such as a math tudor, chauffeur, cook, etc. They seem intent on even replacing the family and claiming the house for themselves if possible, until they stumble upon something shocking and unexpected within the house. And to say too much else beyond that would ruin the amazing experience of viewing this film for the first time! Really, all I can say is this: No other film this year had me laughing so much during one moment, and then completely on the edge of my seat during another, with certain scenes even leaving me absolutely breathless and speechless! The acting, writing, and dialogue were all so brilliant and razor-sharp as well! The film is layered with so many unexpected twists and turns! I never knew where this film was going or what it'd morph or evolve into next, as each scene and moment always felt so radically different and unpredictable than the last! On top of all that, the film undeniably provides a unique subtext on class, social status, the lengths some will go to for prosperity, and how people within certain classes are often perceived. Overall, I can't even begin to heap enough praise towards this masterpiece of a film! It had just about everything to offer, combined so many favorite elements and genres of mine, and left me flabbergasted by the end to the point where I sat through the entire credits and then some in order to properly process and sit with what I'd just watched! This is far and out one of the best films of the year, maybe even the decade!",

In his earlier films “Okja” (2017) and “Snowpiercer” (2013),In “Parasite,” Writer/Director Bong Joon Ho continues his critique of capitalist economies that, in his judgment, inevitably create economic divides resulting in class warfare.  In his earlier films “Okja” (2017) and “Snowpiercer” (2013), Bong used a platform of science fiction to soften the message.  With “Parasite,” he employs slapstick and dark humor to leaven a story that, in lesser hands, might have become painfully didactic.Setting his story in Seoul, Bong has the benefit of dealing with class warfare and economic inequality without the complication of race.  South Korea is one of the most ethnically homogeneous countries in the world – 96% of the population is Korean.Bong’s pacing of his story is impeccable.  In Act One, we are introduced to the Kim family, literally and figuratively living in the lower reaches of the city, the parents unemployed and struggling, the kids getting by on street smarts.  When workers come by spraying white clouds of pesticide in their rodent-infested section of the city, the father advises to leave the windows open:  “It’s free extermination.”  At the other end of the economic spectrum is the Park family, wealthy beyond reason and totally reliant on others to do anything requiring physical or mental heavy lifting.  Bong underlines his premise by conveying clearly that, while they have great wealth, the Parks are not endowed with a particularly high level of intelligence, common sense or self-awareness.When a wealthy friend of the Kim son creates an opportunity for him to tutor the Park daughter, the Kims use this entry point as leverage, creating jobs for every member of the family within the Park household.  So far, the story, is light, bright and slapstick, with only a small vein of dark humor.  This tone offers opportunities for non-threatening exposition.  Remarking on the Parks’ unlined faces, Mr. Kim intones: “Money is like an iron.  It smooths the creases out.”In Act Two, the story takes a darker turn, initially by exploring the consequences of the Kims’ actions on one of the displaced workers.  By the end of the film, class warfare has escalated from bland observations (Mr. Park observes that those who ride on the subway have a “special smell”) to full-on emotional and physical violence.  For me, Bong’s thoughtful, subtly-crafted story invoked a fair amount of thought and introspection.“Parasite” won the top prize at this year’s Cannes Film Festival and is South Korea’s entry for Best International Feature Film at the Oscars.  It’s one of the finest films of the year.",

The last movie that affected me that way was Akira Kurosawa's Ran. The latest to affect me that way is Bong Joon Ho's Parasite. The only other movie I've seen from Bong is Snowpiercer, a film that dealt with the issues of class inequality, in Parasite he returns to this theme, but this time he plays it from a very realistic angle. Bong captures the tension of class disparity superbly, blending grittiness, humour and horror, and striking imagery that completely immerses you in the world he created. The actors all do a superb job, especially Kang Ho-Song, who best exemplifies through his performance, what it feels like to be on the less-fortunate end of the class spectrum. The writing is superb too, in particular how it portrays the struggle to move up the class ladder, using both the optimistic practicality of \"planning\" and pessimistic impracticality of \"dreaming\", in a hard-hitting way. This movie forces you to ride the wave with our main characters, all the way up, and down.The cinematography is beautiful, and the images composed superbly. The way the cinematography captures the architecture of our more-fortunate characters home is breathtaking, so is their lifestyle. No wonder our main characters plot and dream of being in that position, who wouldn't want to be?. The score stands out too. At times it gets super eerie and spacy and combined with the imagery, it helps produce the feeling that you are in a fever dream, and trust me, when the sh*t hits the fan in this, it's a fever dream and then some. I highly recommend this hard-hitting bit of cinema.",

This is the latest movie from South Korean director Bong Joon-ho, director of The Host, Okja, Snowpiercer and more. This is only the second movie of his that I have seen and it really makes me want to watch more!

If that’s an issue for you, don’t see it. You won’t enjoy it. Otherwise, if you want an exciting and well-made movie that is completely original, go see this movie! It’s one of the best of the year!",

In times of cholera and uncertainty, Bong Joon-Ho’s latest and buzziest masterpiece comes like a head-turning accomplishment, a surgically accurate class fable, a truly gripping multi-genre piece of entertainment, and a reinvigorating storytelling-rich decade-new awake. Ever since its Palme d’Or win, “Parasite” has been ground-breaking new history, not only by becoming the very first non-English language, non-epic-length period drama nabbing the Best Picture award at the 2020 Oscars ceremony, but by giving new life into movie-going experience in an aging era of convoluted streaming-service battles and rowdy franchise-building tentpoles.In a way, “Parasite” feels like the “Inception” of this new century. Back in 2010, Christopher Nolan’s towering 160-million Russian doll odyssey opened several doors industry-wise, putting the absolute, always-coveted formula into one single movie: crushing box office incomes, cerebral, wholly original storytelling, and, above else, priceless craftsmanship power. However, Nolan did not treasure any social-resounding message as sharply as Bong Joon-Ho did overseas. “Parasite”, on the other hand, is a small-budgeted, South-Korean thinking piece that, even while managing different procedures— it turned out to be more profitable than Nolan’s pic —comes to the very same conclusion: great filmmaking is the key. Social-headed slices of art would never be about big budgets and small films like “Get Out” and “The Invisible Man” are proving that studios, either big or small, may still conquer audiences with entertaining, on-point storytelling.  Script-wise, “Parasite” is an utter knockout. At first glance, the most outstanding, praised features the film exposes now and again are its turns and twists, the comings and goings of a story where everything mutes into something unexpected. These “think-again” premium plot devices are the main pulling force for mainstream audiences, even though they are not the most powerful assets Joon-Ho has to offer. The truly one-of-a-kind centerpieces are: proceedings and composition. Take for instance the 5-minute towering montage at the end of the first act, where black humor, cadence and rhythm are the beating heart of the sequence. It builds and places anticipation at the highest level by using endless narrative tricks to convey the emotions and reactions the film intends to spring up, blurring the line between good and bad, between wealth and the poverty, between sarcasm and irony. Every one of the characters succeeds at becoming storytelling backbones because of the amazing ensemble cast, which— by the way —became the very first foreign Ensemble Winner at SAG Awards, making, one more time, movie history. Park So-dam, Lee Sun-kyun, Choi Woo-shik, Cho Yeo-jeong, and Song Kang-ho deliver award-worthy performances, endowing to the story tangible, three-dimensional characters that, in incompetent hands, would come out as hollow caricatures.    Bong Joon-Ho’s pictures are described as many things at once: black comedies, social commentaries, genre-crossing post-apocalyptic adventures. Owning every inch of them, “Parasite” spices the mix up with deeper, timely metaphors— make no mistake, peaches and basements are not going to be the same; — however, the film owes it to two crucial aspects: visual language and edition. Camera movements, blocking and visual composition are masterfully managed by the director and his crew. It could have been a silent film, and still it would speak volumes. Cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo executes his vision with perverse precision and voyeuristic delight, grabbing class divide by the throat. What could have ended up as a mere style exercise between the shady lighting from the semi-basement and the luxury LED lighting of the main mansion, it is now the perfect visual cocktail:  sophistication and softness, luxury and poverty, ups and downs, dark and light, hungry beasts in empty spaces. “Gisaengchung” by Bong Joon-Ho is the crowning achievement of the decade. Many critics have healed it as “the picture of the year” and, even if it is tout à fait true, “Parasite” transcends the boundaries of society-headed, industry-transforming films; say Jordan Peele’s ambitious allegory “Us” reimagined through the lens and voices of Shakespeare, Hitchcock and Kim Ki-young, and still you are nowhere near to it. Many talented, socially-aware filmmakers and their equally committed crews have paved the way through the years; now Bong Joon-Ho, in total command of his craft, has made it: “Parasite” is a groundbreaking work of art.",

The film is more or less divided into two major sections:the first half of the film follows a Family living in the poor areas of Seoul (im assuming). After the son Ki-Woo (Choi Woo-shik)is given the opportunity to work as an English tutor in an extremely rich household, he begins to realize that despite having a great income, the adults of the family are not exactly the brightest of induviduals, and so slowly Ki-Woo and his family devise a plan to all come into the employment of their new wealthy acquaintances. Although the film may give a lighthearted impression, once the movie transitions into the second half it becomes extraordinarily twisted, slightly resembling the ending of Robert Eggers's 'The Lighthouse'.After contemplating the events that took place witin the film, It seems obvious to me that Like JB Priestley's 'An Inspector Calls', Bong Joon-ho intends for this movie to display a clear contast between the lives of the rich and the struggles of the poor within this obviously unjust society. Of course it doesn't just rub your face with morals, and there is a very substantial and entertaining plot, but this is one of the main focuses of the movie.As for the other, i'd say that would be the excellent dynamic between characters which is further developed by the brilliant performances from every cast member, particularly Park So-dam who in my opinion was robbed of a Best supporting actress nomination. Other notable features include some top of the line cinematography and a outstanding writing, but other than that I feel there isn't much to talk about.Parasite is an absolute masterpiece, and like so many other films that have come out recently I absolutely recommend it.Fun fact: Elon Musk officially stated that Parasite was his favorite movie of 2019, and whie that's all well and good, the film practically exists to ridicule people like him.",

That's what happened to me, seeing all the good review, I had over hyped hopes for this movie. I'm not gonna say they didn't live up to those expectations but.. It wasn't what I was expecting. The story is a bit all over the place and far fetched but hey that's what I'm used to in Asian horror. I'm going to say that this is a must for any asian thriller fans. The again, I don't even think it's considered a horror. Just has some creepy elements to it. I'd say with the story alone it gets a 7.. With the gorgeous cinematography, that bumps it up to an 8. Some really awesome shots from a photographer's perspective. Loved the telephone wire scene. After saying all that, don't take my word for it, actually don't read reviews at all, they can only tarnish the viewing experience. Heck one of my favorite movies is rated a 30% on rotten tomatoes, that goes to show you how much salt should be taken with a review.",

Director Bong Joon Ho has showed that he has mastered his craft as a director and a screenwriter. The theme of class division is consistent throughout the movie and is shown beautifully through visual storytelling, dialogue, and symbolism. The film's social commentary on the two way parasitic relationship between the rich and the poor in today's society is displayed in a very entertaining and creative way. The twists and surprises along with the super intriguing concept of this con-story made for a movie that entertains as much as any film ever made. Narratively speaking, this story is one for the ages, but it doesn't just stop there. Parasite is a beautiful film thanks to its beautiful and purposeful cinematography, and due to its well-thought out production design. Not only is Parasite a beautiful film to visually take in, but every visual aspect of this film is installed for a reason. Most of the time the visual aspects are installed to enhance the theme of class division. The editing of this film took Parasite to levels even further than already discussed. The flawless editing helped the pace of the movie feel flawless, and it enhanced the thrilling vibe that this movie gives off.The actors in this film ground this realistic yet crazy concept of a film in reality. Without their terrific chemistry and performances, I am not sure that the film would've resonated with as many people as it did. Parasite is a beautiful ride of a movie that transcends any other film experience I've ever encountered. Parasite has invented a new genre of film that just doesn't have a name yet. It's message on how there is a parasitic relationship across classes has been relevant for centuries and will always be relevant. Because of this, the pure thrill of entertainment the movie provides, and the technical craftmanship of this film, I believe Parasite will become a film that will be recognized worldwide as one of the greatest achievements in cinema. Parasite is not only my favorite film of 2019, but it may perhaps be my favorite film of all-time.",

As the camera settles on this view, HangulBong Joon Ho’s 2019 release opens with a sub-ground level view out of a semi-basement window outlooking the alleyway of a Korean slum that will play the setting for most of the first act of the film. As the camera settles on this view, Hangul characters discreetly faze into frame and are quickly translated to the American title: Parasite. This seemingly menacing title (for who has any good memories of a parasite?) is in stark contrast to the equally seemingly innocuous backdrop. This opening frame acts as the films first (of many) contradictions that keeps the viewer intrigued and constantly guessing what will happen next all the way up to its thrilling and touching finale.\tThe film centers around the Kim family: a hard-on-their luck family existing (just barely) amongst the previously mentioned alleyways of the slums that make up the bedrock of this unnamed Korean metropolitan. The family is shown as goofy, well-meaning, cheap, and ultimately entirely relatable. The interesting characters are brought to life by the apparently impeccable talents of the entire main cast. Kang-ho Song acts as patriarch to the Kim family but never acts as the boss. Each family member has a strength to balance any apparent weaknesses they may have. The performances are broad yet nuanced and the dialogue reaches every emotion on the spectrum while always maintaining a hint of comedy. Every character is given a chance to pine as well as get a laugh. If the trailers and posters scare or baffle you, know this: the acting in this movie is worth the cost of admission on its own. The cinematography and writing are all icing on this character-driven cake.\tThat’s not to say the look and writing of this film are not high points on their own. American viewers will automatically find the Korean setting to be a breath of fresh air with great shots of modern architecture contrasting the dreary shambles of the slums. In every frame of the film, the filmmaker attempts to make the background just as important a character as the people delivering lines. And as the viewers become more accustomed to the diverse settings, the plot constantly creates doubt in our securities and hints at something sinister behind every corner. At the moment you feel most safe, Bong introduces something new that shakes and upturns every notion you built up to that point. This all culminates in a showdown that both strips the viewer of all safety while at the same time establishes a new hope. Walking into the cinema as this film begins, the viewer has a pretty good idea of what kind of film they are in for. But as each scene shifts and every conversation is had in the film, the viewer is treated to something completely new and equally satisfying. The viewer will laugh and cry, cheer and gasp, all while cringing and gripping their seats and this is not an experience offered often to a modern audience. In an age of paint-by-numbers blockbusters, this gem offers a shining example of how great storytelling can be different and completely unsafe. Bong Joon Ho’s own concern about Western audiences reservations about subtitled films rang even more resonant after my viewing as Parasite offers one of the best reasons to hurdle that 1-inch barrier.",

TEchnically it is very well crafted, great cinematography, great acting, but personally I think overhyped. In a day an age where everything is political and has to do with social issues, a movie that very blatantly shows the disparages between rich and poor, (a little bit too stereotipically, I might add) is bound to get great reviews. Actors and their 200k bags of face creams like to feel they are connected to the poor massess, and social justice folk of Twitter feel they have been done jsutice, even if only for two hours on a theater. Hollywood wants to be that White Knight, and last year it paraded in their red carpet Mexican Native Yalitzia Aparicio, this year it was the Korean actors, I'll bet next year it will be another troupé. Like the rich family in the movie, minorities and other cultures are nothing but parasites to Hollywood, useful and good while they serve their purpose, stink bugs that have to be fumigated when they don't. Watch the movie for yourself and make your own mind, I don't think it is the 10 everybody is saying but its political message has provided the fuel to skyrocket it. Beware though, last 10 minutes are quite gross and gory.",

Huge praise to Song Kang-ho and Park So-dam especially, they gave amazing performances. The cinematography/set design is also impressive and uniquely correlates with the ongoing story. The use of staircase and lines to tackle the ongoing theme, while not subtle, is done extremely well. The soundtrack, while not exactly memorable, manages to elevate the tense atmosphere and keep people on the edge of their seats. Finally, the film is absolutely entertaining with the way it incorporates contrasting genres, black comedy and thriller, into one surprisingly cohesive and exhilarating movie. THIS IS A MUST WATCH! It deserves best picture for a reason.",

Despite having been out for several months, I feel that many of the film’s true intentions won’t be realized for some time. The film is, as it openly admits, “extremely metaphorical”, almost every decision feeling well-meant and multi-layered. Many people have stated their interpretations of the work, and I feel most of them are missing the point. Parasite is a satire, yet many people seem to be taking it at face value. In an interview, Bong stated that calling lower-class individuals, people who have no feasible means of class mobility, parasites is missing the point; it is the upper class who saps off the lower class via class warfare and exploitation who are the real parasites. In this way and many more, Parasite likely doesn’t affirm the viewer’s world view, it may seem to do so, but this misconception is illustrative of the divide between reality and perception. Parasite, even if watched as an ideologically vacant film is still incredibly deep, with well-placed reincorporation and a constantly evolving plot. Despite its dark undertones and periodically graphicly violent scenes, Parasite remains to be intensely funny, a humour derived from the absurdist reality of the film’s world and premise.",

The plot slowly but surely unveils and it gives you enough clues for you to uncover a lot of its themes beforehand, not that is predictable mind you, but is not unfair or cheap, so several views are recommended.I don't want to speak a lot of the plot so I won't spoil anything, but is not only an extremely well done and entertaining movie, it also serves as an actual social commentary about the poor and the wealth, it is also so well written that it doesn't tell you a moral, it makes you question yours. Please see it with an open mind and make your own conclusions.",
