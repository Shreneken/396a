    "critic_reviews": [
        "Freaks is a mind-bending thriller that is subversive enough to be rebellious, and in this era of CGI superhero cinema, the revolution is welcomed.",
        "In a world packed with information, it\u2019s outright exciting to know so little about where a story is going, or how far it\u2019s willing to go to get there.",
        "Freaks subtly subverts the superhero formula under the guise of a hallucinatory, cautionary tale of paranoia, delusion and extreme parenthood.",
        "The film shrewdly keeps us inside Chloe\u2019s head, filtered through her very limited comprehension of her burgeoning and truly awesome abilities.",
        "Every little detail \u2014 straight down to a smiling child holding out a melting ice cream without caring that it\u2019s pooling atop her hand \u2014 carries weight. Not a second is wasted.",
        "Although in the early going the convoluted plot sometimes struggles to maintain interest, Stein and Lipovsky have such a clear vision that they keep developments confidently on track until subsequent revelations engage in full-throttle action mode, leading to a climax suggesting they likely have future plans for these characters.",
        "One of the film\u2019s successes is its ability to subvert expectations.",
        "The final act isn\u2019t as interesting as the first two were to me. But Hirsch impresses, as usual, as a man losing his wits and Dern always gives fair value as a canny old coot who knows more than he\u2019s letting on.",
        "Appealing, partly because it\u2019s so unembarrassed by its genre's done-to-death social-injustice themes, this undercooked blend of science fiction and family drama virtually dares you to turn up your nose.",
        "It\u2019s watchable and intriguing stuff, yet also silly and inconsistent.",
        "The only problem is that it\u2019s easier to be impressed by the ingenuity of the staging and the architecture of the screenplay than it is to stay invested in the characters.",
        "Lipovsky and Stein\u2019s first feature as collaborators exudes a grungy, second-hand feel, and the movie doesn\u2019t have the confidence or vision to breathe new life into its narrative clich\u00e9s. Instead, the pair lean on the sincerity of their storytelling, crafting a paean to broken families and exploring how children process unspeakable loss.",
        "While it may be a little better in concept than in execution, there\u2019s enough energy, imagination and innovation here to satisfy any genre hound suffering fatigue from the endless wash, rinse, repeat cycle of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, et al.",
        "Half-nifty, half-cheesy.",
        "The fatal flaw of Freaks is that Lipovsky and Stein\u2019s tantalizing approach gives way to mundane results, as the questions raised by their screenplay are considerably more interesting than any of the answers that follow.",
        "This is clearly a film that favours concept over narrative expansion, and it suffers for this."

Thankfully, it isn\u2019t that at all. This movie is more of an X-Men or Stranger Things or Miss Peregrine\u2019s type deal about people with superpowers who are persecuted by normal people who fear them and want to kill them. We\u2019ve seen this kind of thing before, but the way this movie tells its story was actually really interesting. It throws you into this world and slowly gives you information about what\u2019s really going on, like an unfolding mystery. This made for a very engaging and entertaining film. I actually see real franchise potential, there are all sorts of stories that could be told that take place in this world that I would love to see explored, like a low-budget MCU. The performances in this movie are all really good, even the child acting was tolerable! The effects were decent and this movie has a lot of genuinely suspenseful, scary and shocking moments! Definitely check this movie out if you\u2019re a fan of stuff like X-Men and want to see a lower-budget, more mature take on it. It\u2019s very good!",

A father (Emile Hirsch) and his 7-year-old daughter (Lexy Kolker) live captive inside their house, hiding from the world. Turns out they're Abnormals, a group of humans with special powers who have become feared by the world. The appearance of a stranger (Bruce Dern) exposes the girl to the truth. Even though the film manages to create some intrigue, the narrative takes a while to take hold. Sometimes it's confusing what's happening, but once the conflict amps up, the story gets really interesting. There are some basic, but well-crafted special effects, but it's primarily the enthralling human story and the somewhat original take on the subject that makes this worth watching.",

Certain people start to develop superhero like powers and are referred to as freaks. They are easy to spot, as often times, after using their powers, they bleed from the eyes. As with anything they don't understand, the government sees these people as a threat and has started to hunt them down. One such family, having recently lost a wife/mother has gone on lock down in a suburban neighborhood, this is their story. After seeing the trailer for this movie I was intrigued, until I realized it was just a rip-off of the X-Men, without the special effects. Basically they promote this thing like it's the next big thing in Science Fiction, when it's just a very old idea that's been done to death. As for the film itself, it takes forever to get going and even longer for you to realize just what the hell is going on. This crazed father is babbling on making no sense and keeping this little girl locked in this house. All she seems to care about is ice cream, more so than the life of her father or her personal safety, the whole thing was just so bizarre. As for the cast, there really wasn't any chemistry, Emile Hirsch was just awful, playing this paranoid babbling idiot. He's paired with Bruce Dern, who is far too old to really do much of anything, and then there's Chole (Lexy Kolker), the little girl stuck in the middle of all it. The bottom line, Freaks is an idea that has been done and done again, with a cast that so vastly different, that really doesn't click on any level. Worst of all it takes so long to get going and explain what's going on. By the time you finally get it, you've really stopped caring. Freaks looked cooled and has a trailer that will suck you in, but ultimately it's a disappointment.",

It starts out interesting and then lurches through scenes inconsistently, a random mix of slow, perplexing, riveting, simplistic, dull, overwrought, pretentious, and explosive. The concept and writing may have been better than the final presentation, and since the actors were mostly good, I'll have to pin my eye rolling on the director. This really should have been better, but unfortunately it probably took the perspective of the child to an overly-technical degree, and it comes off as childish when it should have been intriguing. I suppose audiences these days aren't given much meat to chew on anymore and so can overlook a lot of cheesy fluff.
