  "critic_reviews": [
    "The movie dramatizes the constraints of the era, the imposition of a narrow and religion-based morality, the stern discipline that’s internalized as a result, the elision of women and their world from public life, and the firm expectations of family and society that Héloïse will endure in her unwanted marriage. Yet it does more than merely depict them—it embodies them, in the characters’ poised stillness, which makes the airy surroundings feel as rigid as stone.",
    "Portrait of a Lady on Fire (the French title uses the less Jamesian “jeune fille”) seamlessly intertwines themes of love and politics, representation and reality. At times it plays like a breathless romance, trembling with passionate anticipation. Elsewhere, it seems closer to a sociopolitical treatise, what Sciamma has called “a manifesto about the female gaze”.",
    "“Do all lovers,” wonders Héloïse in a passionate moment, “feel as though they’re inventing something?” Portrait of a Lady on Fire, a bittersweet celebration of passion and art, feels like that; you’ve never seen another movie quite like this. In its quiet gaze, love becomes art — and vice versa.",
    "There are theme-park rides; there is cinema; there are sacred love poems to take with you for the rest of your life. Thank you for giving us the last one, Céline Sciamma.",
    "Not much music finds its way on the soundtrack, but what’s there is crucial. Vivaldi’s “Violin Concerto in G Minor,\" heard twice and strategically, ends up crystallizing the love story in ways we don’t see coming.",
    "What makes the French masterpiece Portrait of a Lady on Fire — one of my favorite movies ever made, and the perfect Valentine’s Day date movie — so good is that it’s both a great romance and a great love story. The two bleed into each other so skillfully that you’ll almost miss where the romance begins and the love story ends.",
    "Portrait of a Lady on Fire builds and builds and builds, as we keep waiting for an explosion, a big emotional climax. And, not unlike with another great recent import, Pedro Almodóvar’s \"Pain and Glory,\" it arrives with the very last shot — which I won’t reveal other than to say it’s one of the finest pieces of acting and one of the most moving images I’ve seen in eons.",
    "It’s a film that gets brilliantly to the truth of how and why we fall in love, and replicates that sensation — and the heartache that follows.",
    "There are many great acting moments in this film, but you should especially savor the final shot, the long close-up of Haenel in profile. Put simply, it’s why we go to the movies.",
    "Céline Sciamma’s extraordinary fourth feature and a movie of body, heart, and mind.",
    "Haenel, who also appeared in Sciamma’s debut film, Water Lilies, is mesmerizing, conjuring a full person using little more than stillness and a direct stare.",
    "The prime mover is sexual tension, which grows inexorably as the women learn the contours of each other’s lives. Portrait of a Lady on Fire — the fire is figurative, but also real — goes beyond painterly beauty. It sees into souls.",
    "It’s the rare movie that can take something as ancient as myth and use it to break your heart anew.",
    "Portrait of a Lady on Fire is primarily a romance. But it’s also a film about the deeply personal process of creativity—the pain and joy of making one’s emotions and memories into a work of art.",
    "It’s a delicate drama that flourishes through the liberating power of art, where a hopeful yet consuming love affair sparks between two young women amid patriarchal customs, and stays concealed in their hearts both because of and in spite of it.",
    "It also happens to be the best ending of a movie this year and the work of a filmmaker completely attuned to both her craft and the inner lives of her characters. Moreover, the shot is the final act of passion and precision in a film that is teeming with both, a work of art whose flame will continue to smolder in your mind and heart well after you have left the theater.",
    "Just like the short time the lovers have together, Portrait of a Lady on Fire is minimal but perfect, without an image, a glance, or a brushstroke to spare.",
    "Sharply subverting the male gaze at every turn, Sciamma has created an unforgettable treatise on thwarted desire. It is so very easy to label a film incendiary, but Portrait of a Lady on Fire deserves the scalding honour. It will ignite every flame you might have.",
    "It’s deeply romantic and also deeply thoughtful – an electric combination.",
    "This radiantly sensual film ends on the perfect note, a rush of emotional intensity that’s wrapped in a secret, as hushed as the rustle of silk.",
    "Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a film of incandescent scenes and staggering wonder.",
    "A superbly elegant, enigmatic drama ... I was on the edge of my seat.",
    "Sciamma ... has a magnificent capability for elegant prose that wouldn’t feel out of place in a classic novel, the kind of dialogue that simmers long after it is spoken.",
    "Razor-sharp and shatteringly romantic ... as perfect a film as any to have premiered this year.",
    "Assaying [Sciamma's] first period film, an exquisitely executed love story that's both formally adventurous and emotionally devastating, she sticks the landing like a UCLA gymnast in peak condition. It's so good you'll want to watch again in slow-motion immediately afterwards just to see how she does it.",
    "In Sciamma’s gifted hands, the film escapes cliché and becomes something glorious—a study of forbidden love that grandly highlights how much has been lost under the crush of hetero patriarchy.",
    "The final shot of Céline Sciamma’s Portrait of a Lady on Fire is overwhelming. It’s a culmination of the two hours that have preceded it, but it’s more than just the end of a movie. It’s an entire life cycle of a love affair.",
    "Portrait of a Lady on Fire doesn’t shout at you. It whispers gently from the porch of another house, leaving its message to be carried on the breeze.",
    "There’s almost no single moment in Portrait of a Lady on Fire that couldn’t be captured, mounted, and hung on a wall as high art. That’s how visually ravishing it is to experience writer-director Céline Sciamma’s arthouse swoon of movie — winner of both the Queer Palm and Best Screenplay at this year’s Cannes Film Festival.",
    "This is a quantum creative leap for Sciamma, herself a keen observer of behavior. (Her previous films, like Tomboy and Girlhood, were rich with character detail.) Time traveling to an old world seems to unlock the full scope of her passion and insight.",
    "The conversations in Portrait of a Lady on Fire are among the most memorable people have had on a screen in some time, with each line a stanza in a poem, a reversal, a shift in perspective. With every exchange, the relationship between Marianne and Héloïse changes subtly.",
    "This is less a chronicle of forbidden desire than an examination of how desire works. Like a lost work of 18th-century literature, it is at once ardent and rigorous, passionate and philosophical.",
    "Portrait of a Lady on Fire is enthralling on every level. In her hypnotic and haunting film, alive with humor, heartbreak and swooning sensuality, Sciamma has created nothing less than a timeless work of art.",
    "For an instant, I heard the rumble of the coming Revolution, and wondered how Sciamma would conclude her engrossing movie. In violent devastation, perhaps? Well, yes, but the violence is that of a storm-tossed heart, and the final shot is of a woman — I won’t reveal who — shaken by ungovernable sobs, with smiles breaking through like shafts of sunlight. Reckon you can weather all that without falling apart? Good luck.",
    "Though this gorgeous, slow-burn lesbian romance works strongly enough on a surface level, one can hardly ignore the fact, as true then as it is now, that the world looks different when seen through a woman’s eyes.",
    "Visually ravishing ... [A] piercingly intelligent treatise on art, agency and queer love in the 18th century.",
    "What the film excels at, however, is the anticipatory desire. It builds slowly, concluding with a stunning sequence that is all breathless remembrance and self-satisfaction that is both wordless and impalpable. The film will seem the height of romantic desire to some, but will be a slow burn for others.",
    "A film in which everything feels stunningly fresh, raw and new.",
    "Even more powerful than Sciamma’s portrayal of a feminine portrait of solidarity and desire is the statement that art is not exclusive to those who make it.",
    "A Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a richly textured, highly evocative story of love, lust and longing, and thanks to exceptional direction and remarkable, talented actors it’s a work to be cherished.",
    "This isn’t a film that suddenly bursts out at you. Sciamma, like her characters, works by restraining everything. She doesn’t rush the story or focus on a building sense of hunger or passion. The title notwithstanding, the movie is a slow burn, not a fire.",
    "Its enigmatic lustre encourages you to take another look, like Marianne, to try and see what’s really in front of you.",
    "Not since Jane Campion’s The Piano has a costume drama presented such a gorgeous view of love from a woman’s point of view.",
    "Sciamma’s splendid, multi-layered conceit manages to carry equal weight as a love story and a manifesto of sorts for feminine art.",
    "Arthouse audiences will be intrigued to discover how Sciamma has channelled the fluid energy of her contemporary work into the more constrained environment of a costume drama. It won’t hurt that this is a strikingly handsome production which will be admired on a technical level.",
    "It’s still a lovely character study in a lovely setting, even if the romance rarely achieves the urgency or heat to truly animate this “portrait.”",
    "True to its title, Portrait of a Lady on Fire generates more than its share of heat, even if it never truly becomes an engulfing flame.",
    "What's most stirring about Céline Sciamma's film is the lack of artifice in Héloïse and Marianne's feelings for one another."

It's a slow film of forbidden love, two women who know each other briefly for a period of time, but become floored by each other with an intense connection that they both will carry with them forever. Until the ending sequence I felt the movie was a 7.5, pushing an 8, but the last 15-30 minutes pushed it to an easy 9 for me. Very emotional and very very very well acted.

Director Celine Sciamma's latest may be a joy to look at, and its content may indeed constitute an earnest, heartfelt feminine manifesto, but it often comes across as somewhat tentative and restrained in going all-out for what it really wants to say (especially with a title that includes the words \"on fire\" in it). To be sure, this is a fine piece of filmmaking in many regards, but rising to the level of \"masterpiece\" sincerely requires more than what's served up here.",

It is easily my favorite film of 2020 to date. (yes I'm counting it as a 2020 release even though it had a tiny release in December 2019 okay wow) This is a film that showcases the raw might and devastation embodied by forbidden love.  I don't think I have been so moved by a romance in film since 2018's Call Me By Your Name. I feel that the amount of emotion this film is able to evoke results from fully drawn characters, patient, exacting performances, gorgeous lighting, and purposeful cinematography.The way this script reveals its characters' personalities and histories is through the brief and extremely femininely coded interactions between each of them. So much is accomplished by the writing and performances in so little dialogue that both the characters and the audience are given quite an allowance of time to fully soak in the weight of each and every line. Shots will linger on each of the main characters as they act and react to each other in a way that achieves significant tension and suspense, especially for a film in the romance genre. That suspense is only heightened by how this film is lit and shot. Between the beautiful French cliff-side beach and the surprisingly warm castle home, the main locations this film takes place in provide ample opportunities for visually stunning shots, all of which were seized and all of which directly aligned with the script. Honestly, I was gushing for most of the movie over just how effectively the language of the camera was being used. It felt similar to Parasite in that way. With that review and comparison, I don't think my rating here should come as any shock. PoaLoF is on Hulu right now and it is definitely worth a watch.",

There’s a deep, rich luxuriousness to the film, from the cinematography to the acting to the storyNearly every scene in Céline Sciamma’s ‘Portrait of a Lady on Fire’ can be frozen in time, mounted on canvas, and hung on a wall for display.  There’s a deep, rich luxuriousness to the film, from the cinematography to the acting to the story itself, making it ever so deserving of winning the Queer Palm and Best Screenplay award at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival.The ethereal, hovering camera work evokes the essence of a Terrance Malick film.  Considering Sciamma both wrote and directed ‘Portrait,’ her budding career shows no less promise.Noémie Merlant plays protagonist Marianne, an artist tasked with painting the wedding portrait of Héloïse, played by Adèle Haenel.  Héloïse mustn’t know Marianne’s true intentions as the bride-to-be is emotionally fraught, having suffered through the recent suicide of her sister along with a stint in a convent.  The notion of being married off to some Milanese nobleman in a sudden and emotionless marriage may simply be too much to bear.As the cat-and-mouse interplay unfolds, Marianne and Héloïse bond, creating an emotional connection  flecked with romantic leanings.  It’s within this raw passionate atmosphere that the story lingers, offering the audience a meditative mood piece that draws our own emotions into a deep, sensory-rich trance.Though the pacing of ‘Portrait of a Lady on Fire’ is slow, it is necessary to achieve the hypnotic nature of the film.  In capturing this deliberate rhythm, which is essential to the period and plot, Sciamma is able to fully realize the lingering memory of lovers long past into something vibrantly and excitingly new.",

Unlike the typicalPortrait of a lady on fire is a French romance/historical drama from the capable hands of Céline Sciamma, who crafts this meticulous, tantalizing tale of an artist who falls in love with the woman she is assigned to paint. Unlike the typical romance, the film takes a more gradual approach to building a dynamic between each of the characters, which ultimately makes the events that follow all the more meaningful. In Some ways you could say it’s the polar opposite to a romance like James Cameron’s Titanic, which I’ll have you know I’m not especially fond of. This is because in my opinion it (Titanic) rushes the development of the protagonists’ relationship in order to create an illusion of ‘Star crosses lovers’ . In some instances I don’t mind this, such as when used in Romcoms, but in the case of a serious film like Titanic I believe it is extremely out of place. This is one of the reasons why I enjoyed Portrait of a Lady on Fire so much. Rather than rush into the romantic elements, it demands your patience, which in turn is rewarded to a satisfactory extent. One of the ways that Sciamma builds tension between Noémie Merlant’s ‘Marianne’ and Adèle Haenel’s ‘Héloïse’, is that during moments of interest she tends to linger on each of their faces, long enough for the average viewer to decipher their emotions and watch how they alter after certain changes. Of course this does almost entirely depend on the cast’s ability to display said emotions, and fortunately each actress plays their part beautifully. The cinematography is also incredible, with some absolutely stunning shots of vastly different scenery, and although music is used sparingly, when it’s utilized it perfectly contributes to the atmosphere. My one small gripe with this film is that often there is a meaningful scene that feels hastily cut off in order to continue with the plot. Although many people won’t mind this I would’ve personally preferred if they had lasted a tad longer.In conclusion, Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a phenomenal film that echoes the directors passion, and due to a stellar cast, brilliant writing and amazing cinematography I give it a 9/10",

My concern has grown since going to watch it. I'm glad the masses found it enjoyable. I, unfortunately, find myself to be one of few (at least vocal) cinemagoers who did not like the film. Leaving the cinema, I was offended. I felt gypped, cheated, mislead, though, happy to see the back of it. To evoke the saying \"throw me a bone\", this movie showed me its bones, one by one, placed them clumsily into its various pockets and tripped into the sea. I waited for this movie to give me anything, something I could leave with, something to shock me, something I haven't seen before. It gave me the latter, perhaps the most tedious, plodding, most unenjoyable cinema experience in recent memory.  I found myself counting the seconds between each line of dialogue delivered. It was comical. I was grasping for threads to follow, themes of substance, anything, I was starving. Maybe that was the point, a realist approach, showing it as it were, I had surmised. I tossed and turned in this manner until I had no longer cared as to construe purpose in the film. Resorting to taking in the pretty pictures, I landed at the conclusion that this was what the film was, and just that. Just as I relaxed uncomfortably, a thought of Barry Lyndon came to my head. Perhaps this film excels at nothing.As I do with any art related enterprise, I give props to the filmmakers for making art, participating in the craft, and for throwing in their two cents. Offended as I was by the lack of substance within the picture, they provided me with something to get passionate about, even if that may be the distaste for the picture itself. I see this picture called \"The perfect film\", to that I must conclude this is your first time, there's much more in store for you.",
