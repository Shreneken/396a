  "summary": "Togo is the untold true story set in the winter of 1925 that takes you across the treacherous terrain of the Alaskan tundra for an exhilarating and uplifting adventure that will test the strength, courage and determination of one man, Leonhard Seppala, and his lead sled dog, Togo.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The real joy of Togo is simple: Willem Dafoe plus dog, and sometimes Willem Dafoe plus dogs, plural. He tells them they’re good dogs. (They are.) They lick his face. (So would I.) As they race through the ice and snow, they bring a sense of warmth and life to the landscape. It’s wonderful.",
    "The movie is affectionate because it has that sense of animal love that lets entire sequences rest on Togo’s charms, but is by no means letting the dog do all the work. Director Ericson Core (previously of the “Point Break” remake) clearly cares about animals, but filmmaking, too.",
    "The film really hits hard when it leans more into the emotion of it all.",
    "Though Togo is headed straight for a streaming service, it's still feels like a very cinematic experience. Director Ericson Core (who also served as the movie's cinematographer), excels at portraying the brutal conditions Leonhard and his team endured during the serum run.",
    "When Togo gets going, it goes.",
    "There's nary a note of surprise to be found, but the heroism and man-dog bond carry the movie along.",
    "Togo is in a slightly more sombre register than Call Of The Wild but delivers similar sturdy pleasures; exciting dog-in-peril action and striking landscapes, all anchored by Dafoe’s grounded performance.",
    "Willem Dafoe isn’t delivering one of his all-time performances, but he’s also not phoning it in. And these are, truly, good dogs. Togo is content in showing you those good dogs, and not much else. It’s a decent enough way to spend two hours, but only just."

Cinematographer Ericson Core has done his best job in this movie. Cinematography and CGI are the best part of the Disney+ Togo movie. The way the director Ericson Core wanted to connect the entire story with us and he was successful in it. You will also become a little emotional while watching this movie. Willem Dafoe has done his best performance in the role of Seppala.You have to watch a Togo movie for a new adventure, thriller, and inspirational experience.",

This movie features some really solid performances, with Willem Dafoe being the standout, as is usually the case. If you like dogs, definitely watch this movie! It has cute dogs everywhere, and I think they are mostly real with minimal CGI. I’m always amazed at how expressive these animals can be and what they can be trained to do. The subject matter of the movie was very interesting, I feel like I learned something about history from watching it. It also features some really intense and thrilling action sequences that had me on the edge of my seat! I wasn’t that into the structure of the film, it was told in a nonlinear way that kinda took me out of the experience sometimes. That, and I didn’t think the cinematography or the editing were anything to write home about, but other than that this is a good movie that gives you a good old-fashioned triumphant feeling. It’s worth a watch if you have Disney+.",

When it comes to dog centric films, I tend to not watch them because let’s just be honest - most of them are sad. Beautiful, but sad. Togo may look like just another Disney dog movie, but it is so much more. This film blew me away from start to finish. And one really interesting fact about this film is it IS based on a true story. I even fact checked the movie after and was floored to find how truly faithful this movie is to the real events.If you grew up with the animated film Balto, I can’t recommend the watch more, it takes the story of a dog mushing adventure that we loved as kids but made for the whole family - and especially us adults.  Willem Dafoe again proves his worth as an actor, giving a beautiful performance and Julianne Nicholson was a brilliant cast to back his character up. Give it a watch - you don’t be disappointed.",
