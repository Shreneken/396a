    "summary": "An incisive and compassionate portrait of a marriage breaking up and a family staying together.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Johansson and Driver are remarkably, heartbreakingly good in every scene; showing their characters\u2019 journeys to an unflinching camera, letting the gap between them get wider yet unable, for their son\u2019s sake, to completely walk away. It\u2019s a drama playing out on two larger-than-life faces; a family torn apart, and yet enduring.",
        "Divorce severs this marriage like the dull blade of a knife cutting through the tiers of a wedding cake.",
        "What makes Marriage Story  so profound and affecting is its tenderness.  Although there are points where one character\u2019s choices puts the other into serious difficulty, Baumbach doesn\u2019t demonize Charlie or Nicole, and never ever asks us to judge either of them.",
        "If they called it \u201cDivorce Story,\u201d you wouldn\u2019t go see it. And you really should.\r\nNot only is Marriage Story possibly the magnum opus Noah Baumbach has been working toward for much of his career; not only does it give space to two or three or five of our finest working actors to re-enact the human condition as a daily tragicomedy; not only is it a \u201cKramer vs. Kramer\u201d that refuses to take sides.",
        "This often hilarious heartbreaker is simply Baumbach\u2019s best film to date \u2013 insightful, sympathetic and rather beautifully bewildered.",
        "This wonderfully sweet, sad and funny film simply delivers more moment-by-moment pleasure than anything else around.",
        "Driver and Johansson face off to stunning effect in Baumbach\u2019s finest feature to date. So good it hurts.",
        "Ultimately, Marriage Story celebrates life and the journeys all of us are on. Noah Baumbach is the writer-director, and to watch such an incisive, deep-feeling script be given life by actors \u2014 Adam Driver, Scarlett Johansson and those around them \u2014 at the top of their game is to rediscover movies as a powerful medium of personal expression.",
        "Beautiful, witty, sad and hopeful.",
        "Marriage Story manages to be one of this year\u2019s best thrillers, comedies and romcoms all at once. A tender, taut gem of a film that will make you reconsider love and loss.",
        "Marriage Story is such a perfect blend of writing, unflashy direction, spot on performances and score (by Randy Newman) that you hardly even notice all the individual ingredients making up the whole. Its triumph is that it just feels like life.",
        "It\u2019s a life-affirming, profoundly affecting classic.",
        "It\u2019s funny and sad, sometimes within a single scene, and it weaves a plot out of the messy collapse of a shared reality, trying to make music out of disharmony. The melody is full of heartbreak, loss and regret, but the song is too beautiful to be entirely melancholy.",
        "Marriage Story is an emotionally lacerating experience, a nearly flawless elegy for a beautifully flawed couple, a broken-family classic to set beside \u201cKramer vs. Kramer\u201d and \u201cFanny and Alexander,\u201d to name two films that Baumbach references visually here.",
        "A highlight reel for everyone involved: career-defining work from Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, astounding supporting turns courtesy of Laura Dern and Alan Alda, and a masterclass from Baumbach.",
        "Marriage Story sees the end of a marriage as cause for both mourning and bittersweet comedy. The relationship is changing, but not ending. And the evolution is something to behold. To get a story like this right requires a sense of the comical and the absurd along with the devastating \u2014 and Marriage Story delivers.",
        "Marriage Story, unlike so many other breakup movies, offers venom in drips and drops instead of drowning us in it, because it knows that no matter how far apart Charlie and Nicole drift, the feelings that first brought them together are still there, informing their flawed attempts to move on without destroying each other.",
        "This is hilarious, heartbreaking cinema \u2013 a work that will make you burst out laughing one moment, and leave you tearing your hair out the next.",
        "With remarkable grace and compassion for his characters, Baumbach portrays divorce as a great equalizer, turning us into versions of ourselves we didn\u2019t expect to become.",
        "At the heart of Marriage Story are two career-best performances from Driver and Johansson. There is sensitivity, wit and intelligence in abundance, and in one barnstorming scene the kind of raw emotional nudity that\u2019s rarely captured on screen: it\u2019s the painful core of the movie which the laughter might ease but can\u2019t erase.",
        "Featuring powerhouse performances by Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, Noah Baumbach's divorce drama is a bruising tour-de-force.",
        "Baumbach pulls no punches, and exhumes a personal calamity, most people wouldn\u2019t have the stomach to sift through again. It\u2019s wrenching stuff to be sure, but it\u2019s also excruciatingly funny, loaded with empathy, compassion, and understanding too, featuring outstanding performances from its leads, Driver and Scarlett Johansson.",
        "At once funny, scalding, and stirring, built around two bravura performances of incredible sharpness and humanity, it\u2019s the work of a major film artist, one who shows that he can capture life in all its emotional detail and complexity \u2014 and, in the process, make a piercing statement about how our society now works.",
        "Marriage Story puts you through the wringer, but leaves you exhilarated at having witnessed a filmmaker and his actors surpass themselves.",
        "Marriage Story may often resemble a tug of war between its stars, but it\u2019s on both of their sides.",
        "With Marriage Story, Baumbach cements his reputation as one of this generation\u2019s leading humanist filmmakers.",
        "Baumbach takes the time to make room for their opposing viewpoints and experiences, and he creates a richer film for it. Marriage Story is beautifully bittersweet. There are no winners or losers in Charlie and Nicole\u2019s separation, and no heroes or villains, either.",
        "Johansson and Driver both give strong performances, while the use of supporting characters for comedic levity is smartly executed. While the content of the film isn\u2019t happy per se, audiences will find much to like.",
        "Though it may not be an easy movie to watch, or even a particularly original one \u2014 there\u2019s still Kramer vs. Kramer, after all \u2014 Marriage still feels like something special on the screen: a movie that somehow makes its intimacy seem like a radical act, one messy, heart-wrecking moment at a time.",
        "Marriage Story shows Baumbach reaching an entirely new level in his most consummate film to date.",
        "The brilliance of the movie lies in how it starts from a familiar place, then sneaks into transcendence.",
        "It\u2019s sad and sometimes angry, with a heartfelt view of a relationship\u2019s dynamics that some of the director\u2019s prior works lacked.",
        "How does a small tale of love found and lost emerge as a major triumph and one of the very best movies of the year? Marriage Story is more than just a career high for writer-director Noah Baumbach (The Meyerowitz Stories, The Squid and the Whale); it\u2019s a peerless showcase for its stars, Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, who turn this tale of a contentious divorce into a \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" for the 21st century.",
        "That blend of tones, with near-farce and emotional brutality blitzed together, is pure Baumbach, and he dishes it up for two hours straight.",
        "It\u2019s Noah Baumbach\u2019s most mature and generous work to date.",
        "The most important thing in Marriage Story really isn\u2019t the divorce itself. It\u2019s Charlie and Nicole as people on their own individual journeys through one of the hardest things a person can ever go through. It\u2019s a beautiful character piece that revels in its protagonists\u2019 quirks and tics.",
        "Driver ferries Baumbauch\u2019s super-cerebral script \u2014 Baumbach could never not be cerebral \u2014 to a place beyond thinking, where raw emotion becomes an entropic, hurricane swirl.",
        "Somehow Baumbach manages to find a nugget of humor at even the most painful points.",
        "For all its strife and sorrow, Marriage Story is a generous film. It sensitively acknowledges the ways people fail each other, and the ways they don\u2019t. It\u2019s well worth your time. Maybe don\u2019t watch it with your spouse, though.",
        "One of Marriage Story\u2019s biggest successes lies in its straightforwardness. It\u2019s not a story out to change how you think of relationships or marriage. It strives for honesty, even if it\u2019s clich\u00e9.",
        "Baumbach\u2019s main characters are written and acted straight as befits their personal integrity, but the rest of Marriage Story is done in a satirist\u2019s broad strokes \u2014 a penetrating, often inspired satirist.",
        "Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson give their all to Marriage Story, a smart exploration of the emotional intricacies of divorce and how they can rip love to shreds. As characters, they\u2019re a little too extraordinary in their careers to be as relatable as the film wants them to be, but that doesn\u2019t get in the way of the sheer power of the writing and acting on grand display.",
        "It\u2019s only when Baumbach surrenders to the inherent theatricality of what he is creating, that Marriage Story finally takes wing and flies.",
        "Baumbach seeks to mine his material for laughs, no matter how desperate the situation becomes.",
        "At its best, this movie is searing. It pinpoints many of the little talked-about aspects of divorce that seem the least significant but hurt the most. It also eviscerates the practice of Family Law without apology.",
        "Baumbach gets career-best performances from the leads.",
        "I\u2019m not buying every chapter of this Marriage Story, but there\u2019s enough material here to warrant a look.",
        "The divorce part fades in and out of focus while the marriage part unravels in flashbacks. Sometimes they drag on so long you can\u2019t tell the difference. Still, it\u2019s intelligent enough to like it a lot in retrospect.",
        "What makes Marriage Story work, mostly, is the raw nature of the performances -- allowing the stars to flex different muscles than their respective blockbusters -- and the agonizing aspects of the two trying to shield their young son while losing contact with what made them love each other.",
        "Don\u2019t let its sweet title fool you: Director Noah Baumbach\u2019s latest may just be the best war movie of the year.",
        "Throughout, the subtle glimpses of a couple\u2019s lingering affection for one another complicate the bitterness of their separation.",
        "Marriage Story is almost funny enough and touching just often enough to endorse. It\u2019s good, but it\u2019s no \u201cScenes from a Marriage\u201d or \u201cHusbands and Wives\u201d or hell, \u201cCompany,\u201d for that matter. It\u2019s just Netflixable.",
        "Good as Marriage Story\u2019s pieces are, they\u2019re too finely curated: Baumbach rarely lets the film be as messy as it needs to be, hemming himself in with the threads of his limited perspective."

Marriage Story aspires to show the viewer the real emotions and situations of what can actually happens in divorce so you're not going to get a plot twist. The movie essentially sides with the wife as they add the unforgivable bombshell that he has cheated on her. It also never lets him respond to the allegations that he is a smothering, self-involved idiot. She is portrayed as completely justified in blowing up the marriage and dude has to suck on the pain.It's mostly depressing. Any joy or comedy is quickly snuffed out with a new sorrowful revelation. Marriage Story revolves around the emotions and I cannot help but forever process the reasons and details which seemed one-sided and flaky.",

Adam Driver and Scarlet Johansson have turned in career-best performances. Laura Dern is a revelation, and Ray Liotta is quite good too. And then there\u2019s writer-director Noah Baumbach, who truly has outdone himself (I have not seen all of his films, but this is by far the best that I have seen). The direction is outstanding. Perhaps the most exceptional quality of the film is the writing, which is truly ingenious. Not only is the screenplay really moving, but it\u2019s also hilarious; I laughed out loud frequently. I also love how unpredictable and quirky the screenplay is, which serves to make the action and dialogue more realistic, believable, and endearing. The writing and direction remind me a lot of Woody Allen, yet Mr. Baumbach manages to forge his own unique style. This film also reminds me a lot of Kramer vs. Kramer, but I think Marriage Story is superior. This film is sure to be honored at most, if not all, of the awards ceremonies. I for one think that it should win Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and at least three of the acting categories (actor, actress, and supporting actress). Obviously, I have not seen all 2019 awards show contenders yet, but I will be very surprised if a film comes out during the remainder of the year that is better.",

Remembering that Mr.Baumbach\u2019s background as a child of two divorced parents and the ex-husband of Jennifer Jason Leigh, it is easy to understand where his allegiance lies amidst the two parents vying for the affection of their son. As is so often the case where the writer and director are one in the same, this film could easily have used the input of a third party to edit and minimize lengthy scenes and dialogue as well as a choice in casting (since some of the characters appear to be more like stereotypes than real life individuals). One might argue that these lengthy oratorical performances by the characters gives them an opportunity to exhibit their acting wares and, true as that may be, it adds to the length of the film which could be shorter than its 2 and \u00bc hours. All that being said, I give the film a 9.0 because it is a heartfelt and brilliant dissection of the divorce process, those who exploit it and those who are victims of it as written and directed by one of its vital participants.",

A devastating portrayal of divorce that can bring out the ugly in people, especially with child custody. But it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. It\u2019s incredibly heartfelt with plenty of humorous moments. I guess you have to find the comedy during the difficulties in life. Lets just say my cheeks wasn\u2019t dry afterwards.And yes, I wept.Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson both gave masterclass performances. And I do mean some power house acting. Driver plays Charlie, a competitive and undaunted theatre director that he is very clear about what he wants. Johansson plays Nicole, a mother who\u2019s a delightful presence and loves to play, but is also a dedicated actor. This is the best I\u2019ve seen from Johnasson. Her character delivers a monougle where she\u2019s explains the issues in her life that\u2019s all shot in one take, which brilliantly displays her acting chops where she naturally shifts from emotion to emotion - it was impeccable.The supporting cast were all fantastic. Lauren Dern, Ray Liotta, Merritt Wever, Julie Hagerty, and Alan Alda were all brilliant and really bounce off the energy from Driver and Johansson. Even the child actor held his own between these juggernauts of actors.Not only are the performances the strongest element of the movie, but so is the writing. Every character is so uniquely fleshed out that the conflict feels so incredibly raw. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I was so glued to the movie from start to finish. One of the best screenplays of the year.This is the first Noah Baumbach movie I\u2019ve seen from him and I am aware of his other work, just haven\u2019t got around to watching them. However, I feel like this was the best introduction to him as a director, because he crafted such a sympathetic look on marriage dissolving away. We don\u2019t see the full relationship, but we do get to hear Nicole and Charlie individually describe what their love about each other, while there\u2019s a montage that flash\u2019s through their routine life together with their son. Nothing visually striking in the presentation, but not once did it feel stale.The score from Randy Newman was terrific and fitted wonderfully with the movie. I loved the aspect ratio as it added a lot to the overall mood of the movie. When the two go head to head in the custody battle - that doesn't mean they\u2019re enemies. They still talk to each other as if they are still a thing. It\u2019s also hard to pick aside, because you understand where each of them are coming from, and even if you do choose, you still feel bad for either one.Overall rating: Any other relationship movie aint sh*t compared to this.",

Everything about this movie is incredibly compelling. I laughed. I cried. I was on the edge of my seat as I watched the best and worst of a human relationship unfold over the death of a marriage.The element of Marriage Story that shines above the rest of the movie is the acting performances. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver give the best performances of their careers, and Adam Driver in particular proves that he is one of the best actors alive today. His portrayal of a father going through the ringer in an attempt to protect his son broke my heart. He goes through every possible emotion flawlessly, and he is so vulnerable you can't help but feel for the guy.The script is a work of art. There are no good guys or bad guys. No one is right or wrong. Everything is a very human shade of grey, and the story just made me think about how I view my own romantic relationships. The score is beautiful, with a very surprisingly well utilized Stephen Sondheim ballad that anyone with any theatre history will recognize immediately.The cinematography is pure kino. The way space and barriers are used is just beautiful. Its very subtle, but its there. Its implemented wonderfully.This is one of the best dramas of 2019. It's definitely get some acting award buzz. I think this movie will resonate and remain relevant well into the future. I've already made plans to see it again.",

It's also a supremely well-executed artistic experience on a structural, dramatic, thematic, and technical level. It's rare to have a film operate so meticulously in its characterization process, yet remain so fascinating and emotionally impressive. In many other films, you'd label it a potential issue to have your average scene length be somewhere between 7-10 minutes, and to have most of those scenes involve characters simply talking to one another. But these are very carefully constructed moments of build-up, allowing the audience to breathe these characters in and empathize with every action taken and word spoken, no matter how hurtful or diabolical it may seem on the surface. At the end of the proverbial day, we find we're dealing with nuanced human beings trying desperately to navigate their respective ways through a tragic phase of existence (a kind of death, as the movie so aptly puts it). It's sad, heartwarming, brilliant, and earnest -- an experience I know I'll carry with me for some time.",

This profound experience is so rare, that it has happened to me only once. In Marriage Story.Marriage StoryThe writer and director, Noah Baumbach is spewing love. Not the usual way of expressing. But then, miscommunication is a major factor in this film. He is sugar-coating or bitter-coating a love story, by deconstructing, reverse-engineering a love story. Although that is what it seems at first. The film, above all, wonder me the most, is when it balances both sides of the coin. Every now and then, I think about what happened, why we are here, just as those characters do. It all makes sense and nothing fits despite the description, the definition. And still you don't feel cheated. And Noah dodged that bullet so effortlessly that you- at certain points in the film, even when there is no particularly emotional hurdle to cross- melt with a cathartic smile and tears, in its simple wittiness. The film deliberately follows Adam Driver's perspective. Now, that is a perfect choice, considering he \"is walking on\" something that he doesn't fully understand, just like us, the audience. Hence, he comes off warm and even pitiful at times, more than he actually might be or should. For following Scarlett Johanson would have come off calculative rather than spontaneous. Not something that the film wants to put out. It is vulnerable phenomena to be in. And to experience it, you should be out of control. Desperation is what drives the greed. And greed, something you keep it off the table from Day 1, is what it will come to. Not materialistic but philosophical. You'd want to be how you think of yourself to be. And in these scenarios where you are highly conscious of your decisions and acts. Legacy (Henry, in their case) is what you hold on to or at least fight for, now that you are sober.",

I love everyone involved in the movie so expectations were very high. But immediately, (IMMEDIATELY) the intrusive, BUSY musical score started to drive a nail into my head. Here were two monologues; letters written by the lead characters about each other. They were smart (if a little precious) and heartfelt and full of nice details. However, the entire time Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson were speaking, this wall to wall orchestra kept sawing away, frolicking and gamboling like a Rossini overture underlining the moments with 'whimsy' and the promise of 'heartache.' Like a bright yellow highlight pen, the music left no room for independent thought: I was being told exactly how to feel about every second. But I got through the opening bits; although I didn't quite buy any of the director/actor theatre scenes- Why is that no one ever seems to be able to capture the truth of what it's like to do small theatre? Those ridiculous rehearsal scenes were painful in their ostentatious inauthenticity...and don't get me started on the actual performance of the play. It was almost exactly like that old SNL sketch \"Bad Conceptual Theatre\" - If only Dan Aykroyd had stepped out as Leonard Pinth Garnell to give a review - Even more hilarious was the discovery in a later scene that this awful slice of \"high art\" was slated for Broadway. In what universe? But I stuck with it until the scene where Scarlett Johansson reminds her husband that she finds it difficult to cry onstage only to walk into her bedroom and burst into tears. This is a moment that should've wrecked me. It's beautifully set up, and would have been totally unexpected and rending. But at she walks through the hallway towards her bedroom, the score whips up into a Soap Opera ready string-filled cry of anguish so generic it could have been used for that old Carol Burnett sketch As The Stomach Turns. The camera pulls in to show Scarlett's tear-filled face - but any empathy is immediately sucker-punched to the ground by the hideously OVER THE TOP music.Cut to: this morning as I scanned through the Golden Globe Nominations. Not only is that exercise in bathos and banality actually nominated for Best Original Score... It was written by none other than Randy Newman. Bummer.If I make it through the movie it will be with the sound off and the subtitles on. I like to decide how I feel about things. I don't need to be smothered in kisses to know I am loved. And I don't need to be swaddled in a treacly, syrupy, honey-laden, jokey, telegraphing soundscape in order to understand that sadness or joy are on display. I'm pretty sure I'm smarter than that. My CATS are definitely smarter than that. It's no coincidence that Bennett coughed up three yards of hairball during the first thirty seconds of the movie.",

When she gets an offer to work in LA, it makes their impending separation much more stressful. There's more focus on the husband, perhaps because his situation is more disruptive or because writer/director Noah Baumbach based this on his own experience.

Johansson also does a fine job, along with a wonderful supporting cast, esp. Laura Dern and Alan Alda. It's good that they both play their attorneys, because the legal angles tend to drag down the emotional development. As their young son, Azhy Robertson is exceptionally natural.

One critic declared it is 'easily the most compelling divorce story since Kramer V Kramer.' I suppose it depends on what you consider compelling. There are plenty of other films about divorce but the one that springs to my mind is Todd Haynes' 2015 film, Carol, impeccably cast, acted and shot. Carol received a 10 minute standing ovation at Cannes that year and scored 95 on Metacritic, just one point more than MS (though Carol is a far superior film in every sense). There are a good deal of curtain-chewing and adult tantrums in MS but these don't disguise the fact that there is very little 'story'. MS is well acted but the characters don't really have much to work with. Their marriage has real problems, certainly, but good grief, what marriage doesn't? Basically, they need to talk more; she needs to be more assertive and he needs to listen and make compromises. Instead, they wind up paying absurd amounts of money for something that could easily have been worked out with more mediation. No doubt this happens all the time, but do we really need to witness the histrionics? Put simply, Marriage Story is mush in the same way that the weakest Woody Allen movies are mush. If you engage with that kind of jump-improv, indulgent, pseudo-self-analysis; if you like watching dewey-eyed, beautiful couples who have an almost perfect relationship talk themselves apart (leaving their oddly untraumatised child apparently saner and happier than either of them) then break out the popcorn and paper hankies.

Driver plays a New York-based theatre director traveling back and forth from there to LA where Johansson's character primarily lives as an actress that started out in film but now does theatre to support Driver. Any film that deals with divorce automatically hits close to my heart, as I come from divorced parents. I'm always interested to see how it will be portrayed differently in each film. And I gotta say, I think the last time I watched a divorce film that was so raw and honest about divorce was 'Blue Valentine' from 10 years ago starring Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. And while this one isn't quite as dismal and bleak as that one was (there are some endearing moments to be found in this one), this one still managed to portray all of the nitty gritty details and pitfalls that accompany long and bitter divorces. On top of that, Driver and Johansson deliver what I'd easily consider to be Oscar-worthy performances. Laura Dern also particularly shines as Johansson's divorce lawyer. Overall, while it's certainly not the first film to deal with divorce in great detail, it still gives a pretty unflinching look at the toll it takes, and that was more than enough to make it stand out to me.",

For two hours, you watch them go through every conceivable emotion, and you believe them in every moment. The supporting cast is great as well. The plot is simple, but that doesn't really hold the film back. My only complaint is that both characters are so financially successful that the money doesn't really come into the picture, except for a few lines where Driver complains about how much money he's spending on his lawyers. I would have liked to see the two of them making some really difficult financial decisions, like the ones people would face in a real divorce.",

The truly superb ensemble cast, with excellent performances by Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver, Ray Liotta, Julie Hagerty, Alan Alda and, especially, Laura Dern, coupled with a razor-sharp script, makes for a dynamite combination that reaches out, grabs and holds audience attention from beginning to end. Arguably Baumbach's best film, this offering is more than deserving of all the praise that it has rightfully had heaped upon it. You'll laugh, you might cry and you'll definitely feel the heart strings tugged with this one, but the picture assuredly earns the reactions it evokes.

No, but that's mainly due to the fact that the root of its story is centered on gender imbalance.The recurring case in couples of: what I do became less important than what you do and it's quite evident that this is the main reason for the separation the film tolds. Maybe other things did their harm but that's the key point.The thing is the film walks again and again on that line without achieving a more interesting balance and especially for the little that both characters grow during their hard journey. Especially Charlie, Adam Driver's character. Ironically, although it seems that Baumbach wanted to show more balance between both sides, he does not succeed, especially because even though he allows Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) to express her frustrations at the same time as her personal and professional ambitions beyond her family life, when the time comes for the court fights, Baumbach turns Nicole's voice in court into a kind of villain. Her lawyer, which is ironic because her lawyer is someone who is really understanding what Nicole is expressing.I always felt the film was more inclined towards Charlie's side. For the rest, well I can say that I don't deny that both Driver and Johansson's performances are pretty good and I certainly believe that they will get into the Oscar nominations but their work is not really the reflection of the background of their characters or the story for that matter, because as I said, this film is not bad at all but its strengths lie in updating the subject in our times, nothing more, yet something like divorce we know that not only encompasses the issues we see here.This was a really good film to close this year and another success for Netflix and its catalog but honestly I keep saying that Baumbach is credited with merits that I simply do not see in him.",

It never really feels rushed with individual scenes, but to make that possible, important background details are glossed over and so are the characters. The characters aren't especially generic, but still somewhat shallow and predictable. The plot certainly offers some surprises, but is also mostly predictable for someone familiar with divorce outside of a fictitious context. Ultimately, the movie is thin in terms of portraying the course of a marriage and divorce, but there's something to be said for its success on that front given the run time. The movie has its surprising moments of humor as well, but that's important because even with humor, I came out feeling more pessimistic about marriage, relationships, and people. But this movie didn't opt for the feel-good, sugar-coated route like most movies of this type do. It argues that things aren't really ever going to be black-and-white and doesn't give us one answer to the issues explored in the movie because there isn't.",

What a great story about relationships and the beginnings and endings of them. Marriage Story is a flawless, heartbreaking story led by two of some of the best performances of the year. Adam Driver is phenomenal. Most people know him from the new Star Wars Trilogy but people should really see some of his other films. He usually does a great job but in this film, he is 100% dedicated to the role. They are certain scenes in the film where it doesn\u2019t feel like he is acting. It feels as if he is actually this character and going through all of these troubles. He puts so much emotion into his performance that it is heartbreaking yet mesmerizing. Scarlett Johansson gives yet again another fantastic performance. While her performance isn\u2019t as mesmerizing as Driver\u2019s performance, it\u2019s still perfect. She also conveys a huge amount of emotion with her role but adds a slightly more comedic and relaxed atmosphere to Driver\u2019s serious and hardworking atmosphere. Both actors play off each other perfectly, even in scenes where their characters are fighting with each other. Every other performance in the film is pretty great, especially from Laura Dern. The script for Marriage Story is fantastic. It compliments the performances and feels very natural. It knows how much the characters need to say to get a point across or when to restrict them. The music and cinematography are great. The music is done by Randy Newman (Toy Story) and fits the depressing tone the film is going for. The film makes the good choice of not using music during certain dramatic scenes which helps make those scenes more emotional. The cinematography isn\u2019t groundbreaking by any means but there are a lot of beautiful shots. Towards the beginning of the movie, there is a 5 minute uncut shot of Scarlett Johansson talking about why she stopped being in love with Adam Driver\u2019s character and it\u2019s great. There is one sequence in the film that is perfectly shot, acted, and scripted and it\u2019s the argument scene. I felt sad and a smidge emotional for the characters throughout the film but this one scene made me feel a whole lot. It\u2019s one of the best scenes in cinema this year. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson completely disappear in this scene. It doesn\u2019t feel like acting. It feels like the filmmakers just filmed real people breaking apart. The emotion displayed in this one scene is off the charts. It cemented for me that Adam Driver is a masterclass actor that people should pay more attention to besides being known as \u201cthe guy from Star Wars\u201d. The rest of the film has its emotional moments but they don\u2019t top that scene. The film\u2019s plot is pretty straightforward but the way the characters interact makes the film feel unpredictable. Noah Baumbach used his direction to make a straightforward story feel unique. I\u2019m going to start paying more attention to Baumbach from here on out. Overall, Marriage Story is a fantastic film about relationships and divorce with some of the best performances of the year, an outstanding screenplay, unique direction, and some great cinematography and music.",

This movie gave me the feelings of divorce and stubbornness that I have not went through yet in my life but I could see and feel so clearly in the movie. The characters played by Scarlett and Adam seemed perfect couple at first glance, then you dive into the relationship and see the cracks within. Throughout the movie I felt for Adams's character most of the time, feeling like Scarlett's just wanted to run away from a great family life in NY. After seeing her point of view and her family situations, I could totally understand why she felt so entrapped and needed to spread her wings and make decisions because she wanted to and wanted to feel in control. The ending makes it all feel so streamlined and connects back with the start of the film in a good way showing that maybe if she read her letter, all of this could of been fixed. The acting is what makes this movie and I have to say that is some of the best acting Ive seen in the big fight scene between the ex-couple. Great movie that makes you feel what the characters are feeling throughout the movie without saying it word for word explaining the emotions.",

We've always known ScarJo is an excellent actress but I think this is her peak so far. Many times the actors portray the subtext of a conversation or half-hidden feelings in a more true-to-life manner than I've seen almost anywhere else; so that we feel as though we are on the titanic, watching an iceberg emerge from the darkness with dread inevitability. When those feelings do come to the surface, it is with simultaneous relief and crushing loss.I often found myself thinking that the marriage could have been saved and that is why this only gets a 9. I wasn't sold on the idea that their marriage was that bad. This is either the fault of the writer for not conveying the misery of the marriage (although one could argue that this is outside the scope of the film, and the viewer is simply to take this for granted), or due to the selfishness of either one or both of the characters. The fact that I don't know which of these is the cause is either a minor stroke of genius or a minor annoyance, hence the -1. Being a romantic, I found the film quite wrenching. I recommend it to all who enjoy good acting and being put through the wringer. Some films hurt-so-good, but this one kinda just hurts.",

It's an emotional movie, with excellent performances by Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, (both are at their best work in their careers), they deserve an Oscar nomination. Noah Baumbach's direction is quite simple, but at the same time manages to entertain the viewer with the story being told. The cinematography is interesting, the editing work is decent and the soundtrack is very well mounted to the progress of the film. Laura Dern's performance can also be cited, a very good performance and full of emotion, she deserves an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress.
