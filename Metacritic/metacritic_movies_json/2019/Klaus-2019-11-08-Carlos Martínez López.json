Jesper is about to give up when he finds an ally in local teacher Alva (Rashida Jones), and discovers Klaus (Oscar winner J.K.

These unlikely friendships return laughter to Smeerensburg, forging a new legacy of generous neighbors, magical lore and stockings hung by the chimney with care. [Netflix]… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Sergio Pablos' Klaus is a beautifully animated mix of old and new - offing up a unique and quirky take on Santa's humble beginnings. It's a fun, fresh story about friendship and the power of kindness that coats snowbound cliches with a shiny sheen.",
    "Klaus is a weird, meandering tale — but it has a distinctive visual style and a sly sense of humor and features brilliant voice work from the ensemble cast.",
    "The goofy and charming Klaus probably plays better if you don't know going in that it's a Santa Claus origin story.",
    "Sergio Pablos’s film is essentially a metaphor for its own unique and refreshing mode of expression.",
    "It’s awkward and weird, and yet all that awkwardness and weirdness give it personality and charm and a freewheeling, nonsensical quality that feels refreshing.",
    "It all moves along so amiably, and offers such consistently delightful visuals, that the conventional plot points, up to and including an inevitable “but I can explain” bit, are entirely digestible.",
    "Sergio Pablos' Klaus invents its own unexpected and very enjoyable origin story for the big guy who gives out toys every Christmas eve. Shaking off most Yuletide cliches in favor of a from-scratch story about how even dubiously-motivated generosity can lead to joy, it contains echoes of other seasonal favorites (especially, in a topsy-turvy way, Dr. Seuss' Grinch) while standing completely on its own.",
    "It’s far more successful with holiday magic than it is with character-based comedy, but that’s not enough of a flaw to keep young audiences (and their parents) from potentially turning this feature into a cherished annual tradition.",
    "It’s not remotely as polished as the earlier contenders in the field, but “Klaus” is good enough to have earned a theatrical release, on a par with MGM’s “The Addams Family,” in any event.",
    "As admirable as it is that “Klaus” in the overall isn’t a sugar-rush cartoon fix of wisecracks and mayhem, it’s also too lazily reliant on insults and insolence as its go-to mode for comedy. But what does work is the snowy, hilly luster of this bygone-era fairy tale environment, and the seasonal soul the filmmakers have tucked inside their invented history about children’s yearly haul.",
    "Solid first and third acts can’t disguise a so-so middle section stuffed with conventional story beats.",
    "None of the characters in Klaus are as delightful as they are well-drawn, and Pablos’ film never earns the holiday spirit it tries to manufacture down the home stretch. But there’s no denying that the future of “traditional” animation looks a little brighter than it did yesterday, and that’s reason enough to celebrate.",
    "What goodwill the movie does inspire owes more to the splendid visual world than to anything the story supplies."

This is a truly inventive, good-hearted Christmas film.The film uses old-fashioned animation with digital techniques to bring a 2 1/2D look to it. This looks AMAZING. I don't think I've seen something quite like this. The painted appearance to the backgrounds and characters looks great. The designs of the characters and locales are all distinctive, especially the characters. There is a wide cast here and they are so stylistically designed. The movie takes place around this town where two clans are at war. The townspeople are such a wonderfully diverse group of grotesques. I also loved the look of Klaus (voiced by J.K. Simmons) who is given a large, broad-shouldered figure. The character movement is also really fluid.The story is equally good. Although the film ultimately goes the way you predict it will, the storytelling in this is so well done that it doesn't much matter. The idea of the story of Santa Claus being told through non-magical reasons and happening through the actions of a postman is definitely something different from most attempts at Santa origin stories. The warring clans part brings a nice dab of dark humor while the sentimental bits are done nicely. All the characters are likable.I highly recommend you check this out. This is just a really well-done family Christmas movie.",

Never before have I seen an animated feature look so amazing.  Every frame is a work of art, skillfully composed and incredible shaded.  The story is wonderful, and an original one at that.  Sergio Pablos and his team have done something truly EXTRAORDINARY with this gem and I for one can't wait to see what they do next!  Our family will be watching this every year.  It is an instant classic, and THE best original content on Netflix.  Please ignore the cynics and watch this movie over and over again.  Your heart will thank you for it.",

What makes this film work so well is not that it's some silly story about Santa Claus, but the very real impact people can make in our day-to-day lives. How greatness can come from nothing, even ill-intended goodwill is still goodwill, and the results are spectacular. It is this expose of generosity that gives Klaus a real meaning and value beyond the obvious. It's a beautiful story with a core of solid gold that cannot be broken by critics who seem far more comfortable giving high praise to revenge stories, perhaps because they see a bit more of themselves in characters so absorbed in hatred. I am truly shocked a film of this stature only received a 65 on Metacritic, and for some strange reason the rather uninspired Toy Story 4 snagged the Oscar over this masterclass of storytelling. A good story should be what means the most to the audience. And on that front, Klaus excelled in spades. We see a town embroiled in hatred. We see the destitute. We see the excuses. We see good people turned bad. And throughout the movie, a whole lot of bad people turned good. A true act of goodwill always sparks another. That is the foundation of the entire story, and the strength and wisdom of that gives this entire film a transcendent foundation that cannot falter. It's a message we need more of these days, and one that has never been shown more beautifully. A rare 10/10 from me.",

And in this movie I really do see where the critics are coming from. This movie has very few surprises in the way it builds its narrative. Even casual movie watchers will recognize each and every part that makes up this movie and there are definitely parts of this movie that are worth criticizing. Some of the jokes fall a bit flat. Some of the line deliveries could have used a second take, etc. However, this is where the critics fail. Often through no fault of their own, apart from being jaded from experience, they too often break down a movie instead of taking it as a whole and that does this movie a massive disservice.This movie has an incredible amount of heart that is present throughout and you can tell that the creators really put their all into presenting it. The animation, atmosphere and storytelling, even if it isn't anything really new, is amazingly adept at making the audience feel. Throwing us between joy and sadness sometimes even in the very same scene.And for a Christmas movie it really nails it. I could see myself watching this every year with my family as it's just that good at setting the Christmas mood.This is, without a doubt, a future Christmas classic.",

It’s hand-drawn animation that is shaded to look like CGI. I’ve never seen this style before and it looks great! It’s so colourful and well-designed. The voice acting and the writing is really damn good too! Honestly, there are only a couple issues I have. Some of the music choices and what little CGI this movie does use seem out-of-place, but other than that this might be the best Christmas movie since Arthur Christmas. It’s certainly the year’s best animated movie, and the best animated movie in general since Into the Spider-verse. Give it a watch with the family, it’s really delightful!",

One of the few Christmas cartoons that I liked so much. Klaus is a very kind (although there is violence) and warm film that should gather the whole family around it and make these one and a half hours pass in one breath. Klaus also shows that a very beautiful cartoon does not require animation like Disney or DreamWorks. Summing up, I would like to say a huge thank you to Sergio Pablos and the whole great team for creating such an amazing cartoon that I am sure I will watch more than once, and not necessarily at Christmas.

Al fin y al cabo, creo que todas las películas navideñas son muy destacables. No me arrepiento de nada. Es una de las películas mas buenas que he visto en muchooooooo tiempo. -Empecemos hablando de los gráficos: Si bien es cierto que algunos personajes no están tan bien animados si lo comparamos a películas como Spirited Away o Toy Story o la poca variedad de escenarios, el diseño y el detalle de los mismos es simplemente espectacular... DEMASIADO! Contando con un excelente uso del 3d 2d y escenarios muy vistosos. Esta es una película muy BELLA, notándose los colores, la iluminación, la noche, el clima... Es una de las mejores películas animadas en cuanto a gráficos se refiere.-La trama: Se podría decir que el explicar los orígenes de la navidad, ya de por si es innovador. La trama es un poco triste en ocasiones y los personajes y su relación con el cartero con el paso del tiempo hacen que se note un gran cambio en sus personalidades, decidiendo que es lo mejor para todos.-Resumen: \"Klaus\" junto con \"Los Fantasmas De Scrooge\" y \"El Expreso Polar\" es una de mis películas de navidad favoritas. Incluso se podría decir que es innovadora. Lastima que no haya mucha variedad de escenarios, pero el detalle en los mismos, junto con la trama hacen de esta película toda una experiencia. Totalmente recomendada, tanto para ver ahora como en navidad.",

I am confident in saying that this could become a Christmas classic although I had some issues that are common in ChristmasMost of this year’s Netflix releases have been bland and boring but I’m glad to say that Klaus is the exact opposite. I am confident in saying that this could become a Christmas classic although I had some issues that are common in Christmas related films. The story is a little simplistic. I know that it’s more for children but I wish that these stories had a little more depth and more ideas presented. Even though the story is simplistic, it is still engaging. I was never bored throughout the course of the film and I was always interested in the characters and what they were doing. For a Christmas film, the characters are pretty good. The villains are kind of boring but the rest of the characters have their own interesting arc that they go through. This is boosted by some great voice acting from Jason Schwartzman, Rashida Jones, and J.K. Simmons who plays Klaus in the movie. Simmons gives the best performance in the film by far. Jason Schwartzman does a pretty good job although he was given a Christmas cliche that did annoy me. It’s the standard cliche of a character has different motives that change before the end and has a misunderstanding with the other characters who ignore him. That happens in this film and it was a little obnoxious. Some of the music choices were pretty weird too. They decided to create an original song for the film and it didn’t fit it that well in my opinion. The animation is beautiful in Klaus. It’s all hand drawn animation and it reminded me of classic Disney films. The design of the town was pretty great and interesting with all these different characters doing different things. There were some jokes thrown into the film and some of them weren’t that funny but the funniest ones were the jokes you can see in the background. All of these little visual cues were hilarious in my opinion. There is a lot of heart to this film. I was surprised at how much joy I felt when watching this and the ending was fantastic. It’s sad and joyful at the same time. This is a film I will probably start watching every Christmas. It’s a satisfying origin story to Santa Claus. Overall, Klaus may be a little too simplistic with weird music choices but its heart, animation, and voice acting make this an instant Christmas classic.",

I'm so happy to see movies that push boundaries and try to offer something different visually speaking, and this is one of those. There isn't a single moment in the movie that looks bad. It's stunningly beautiful, highly energetic and with so much style. It is like watching moving illustrations. In the other aspects, this movie is still really good. The concept is actually pretty unique. It's basically a Santa Claus \"origin story\" and a really creative one with so much originality...For the most part. See, the story for two-thirds of the movie was flawless: The pacing was great, the writing was great, everything felt great. It was until the end of the second act and the third act when I started to really disagree with some writing choices in both story and dialogue. The movie felt sort of anticlimatic in the end. I'm pretty sure that if the writers worked in some more ideas for the second half of the movie, it would've been pretty much a flawless screenplay. There were some emotional moments that really worked, but could've worked so much better if the music choice was better. Speaking about that, there were some music choices that felt out of place. Unlike a movie like Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse which I also critized some music choices, at least the \"bad music\" made sense because it was established that rap/hip hop music was associated with the main character: Here, there were some songs that felt out of place because they don't fit the setting and the time period at all, which is definetely not the present day. The humor was, in my opinion, pretty \"hit or miss\", but when it hit, it was really good. The characters are full of personality and charisma. I really love the character design overall. It looks so stylistic and energetic and watching those designs in motion...Jesus Christ! So gorgeous. I'm so happy this movie exists. Despite some issues I pointed out, this is a great movie and one of the best animated movies I've seen during the year. Definetely give it a watch, especially if you're an artist or an animation student or you are just interested in animation, because this is an example of how making something look different from other movies can give it so much personality and uniqueness.",

As per usual, IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes hit the nail on the head with their reviews for the movie giving it an overall score of 8.5/10 and 90%. As for Metacritic… well as per every movie that seems amazingly done they will try and find something be it so insignificantly small or just wrong, in order to slander the movie and therefore make their “opinions” “unique”. Metacritic is like that one kid that you don’t want to invite to anything because you know that the kid will just ruin it for you completely, they are the pessimists that no one likes and that always have wrong opinions. Metacritic gave this an overall 63%. Now I understand that there are people in Metacritic who give actual reviews but the majority is so awfully wrong that you would have to question if they just let their 3-year-old baby’s write the reviews or they are being forced at gunpoint to write such horrible reviews to keep their lives. Although this is a review of Klaus the movie I have to take time to address the horrible scrutiny that most of the time is complete poop, to be frank. Metacritic as a whole is just for people with “unique” opinions to feel like they belong somewhere, unique as in completely wrong, pessimistic, horrible just horrible opinions. Now don’t get me wrong they have given fair scores to movies such as The Dark Knight with an 84% or Marvel’s Avengers: Endgame with a 78% (I am being sarcastic and believe these movies should be given much higher praise) some may believe that this is because Metacritic has very high standards but that is far from the truth, taking good movies and games and saying they are bad because they don’t meet the impossible standards they set in their own minds is plain stupid. Most people who like Metacritic don’t even pay attention to their own reviews because they know its all botched. Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB are not the best either but of the three rotten tomatoes and IMBD seem to have the best grip on what the audience thought and what the critics thought to give the best overall scores (if you look at how many critics actually use Metacritic its so low that people just shouldn’t even bother paying attention to Metacritic when they search a movie up on google). In conclusion, Metacritic’s reviews are like watching someone cut their finger off with a rusty fork, its just wrong and it doesn’t work well at all, or its like watching a kid kick you in the crotch and then you tell them “don’t do it again” and they just do it again because all they heard was “do it again” they don’t listen to anyone and keep doing the wrong thing.Why Klaus Is Amazing\tEven before one word of dialogue has been said you can already tell that you are in for a treat, the animation and artwork for this movie is absolutely gorgeous and it helps the visual storytelling by a lot. Before knowing what’s going on the art shows us we are in a timeless land and that this is a remodeling of the old Christmas story of Santa. The actual plot is amazing, it takes many cliches but makes it work in a way where they actually work as good storytelling devices. Every single detail and point made in the story equal to amazing results and quality. The new take on Mr. Klaus was wonderfully done and with the addition of the art design it helped all the audience to feel like a kid again, everything that was once magical IS magical still. I dont believe I have ever seen a movie that told the story of Christmas in a new way and actually worked as an amazing piece of art. The length that this story goes with its new Santa is done magnificently, making him a regular human (or so we thought) not only made us connect with him more but also made us smile like kids to know that this man is Santa. The main character of the story Jesper Johanna is a regular post office man who helps create the Santa story, making him come up with the naughty list and the giving children toys on Christmas thing was such a wonderful surprise. Because we love this character we don’t mind him changing the story, although it did bother me at first that Santa wasn’t just a magical being, the ending made me really wonder “was he really not magical? Or did I just not notice” the way they humanize him is truly incredible.  The wind as a symbolic reference to Santa’s past lover is a cliche but works so well in the story that it doesn’t take anything away and just adds even more. The wind being symbolic for Santa’s wife and the wind moving through the snow, (which is connected to Santa because it represents Christmas which he holds dear to his heart) just creates even more amazing symbolism. The ending was amazing and really was an unexpected tear-jerker.",

This is easily the greatest animated Christmas movie ever, and just one of the best Christmas movie in general. Its up there with the greats like A Christmas Story, Christmas Vacation, It's a Wonderful life, and Miracle on 34th street. This movie has a great tone, and great themes. It's very emotional, while also being very funny. The animation is also gorgeous. It is easily some of the best 2D animation ever. I would even argue its the best 2D animation. I love this movie and give it a 9/10 and it goes on the S tier.",

A well-executed movie can be a transformative experience and leave a positive, lasting impression. For me, the most recent movie I’ve seen that had that effect on me was Klaus. It’s a great story about selfishness turned selflessness, hatred turned love, and the true power of giving.“A true selfless act always sparks another.”If you haven’t watched it I won’t ruin it for you, but I will say that I aspire to have an impact on our community like Jesper has on Smeerensburg. It won’t happen overnight nor by just my own hands, but rather with the help of those around me it will happen over time. I’m looking forward to the journey as that story unfolds. Thanks, Sergio, for this movie. It’s now on our annual rotation of Christmas movies to watch with the family.",
