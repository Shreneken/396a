    "summary": "At the height of the First World War, two young British soldiers, Schofield (George MacKay) and Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) are given a seemingly impossible mission. In a race against time, they must cross enemy territory and deliver a message that will stop a deadly attack on hundreds of soldiers\u2014Blake\u2019s own brother among them.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "1917 is a work of sweeping scale yet pinpoint intimacy.",
        "Perhaps no film can capture the enormity of that war, which left around 17 million dead, and generations to grieve. Director Sam Mendes wisely takes the opposite approach, personalising the experience through two young British soldiers sent on a harrowing, high-stakes, night-long mission, he creates a film that is tense, exhilarating and profoundly moving.",
        "Yes, it\u2019s a dazzling technical feat. One could also consider it a gimmick, or at least a method that threatens to distract the viewer\u2019s attention. But that ignores the fact that this very filmmaking style is also hugely effective at delivering this particular story, in the most visceral way possible.",
        "With brilliant, innovative, claustrophobically effective directing choices by Mendes, Oscar-worthy cinematography from the living legend Roger Deakins and strong, raw performances from the two young leads, 1917 is a unique viewing experience you won\u2019t soon shake off.",
        "It\u2019s impossible to overstate the immersive feel and psychological sway of 1917; Mendes inhabits those god-forsaken trenches in ways that are palpable, bringing the stink, filth, claustrophobia, and gallows humour to bear with stunning resonance.",
        "The intensity is overwhelming. Every war is hell, no matter when it was fought, but 1917, which is about a war far removed from contemporary reality, turns out to the best war picture since \"Saving Private Ryan.\"",
        "The long-shot is hardly a novelty \u2014 as it so often tends to be wielded in Hollywood \u2014 but a point of view \u2014 a feeling even. And rarely, if ever, has that style been so affecting and executed so beautifully.",
        "1917 is a modern war classic and one of the best movies of the year.",
        "1917 is Mendes\u2019s most purely ambitious and passionate picture since his misunderstood and under-appreciated Jarhead of 2005. It\u2019s bold, thrilling film-making.",
        "1917 is an expertly crafted and emotionally exhausting thrill-ride behind enemy lines. Gloriously shot, deftly paced, and striking in its gruesome recreation of the time and place, Sam Mendes\u2019 1917 wisely never loses sight of the smaller, intimate elements in a fast-paced story with immense scale and action.",
        "Deciding to craft a film as though it were all done in a single take means that everything must balance perfectly lest the artificiality be underlined rather than smoothed over. It is a credit to every person who worked on this film, at every level of development and execution, that 1917 works as well as it does.",
        "The proximity and intimacy of the technique render Schofield and Blake\u2019s journey more visceral, and more frightening. And as a result, at its conclusion, the catharsis lands with the force of a hammer.",
        "The film belongs to Chapman and more than anyone, MacKay, a 27-year-old Londoner with the long bones and baleful eyes of a porcelain saint or a lost Caulkin brother. His Lance Corporal Schofield isn\u2019t just a surrogate Everyman; he\u2019s hope and fear personified, and you couldn\u2019t look away if you wanted to.",
        "The film underscores its technical prowess with a raw, emotional story that finds beauty struggling to push through all the muck and mire. In 1917, war is hell, but it\u2019s a hell you can find your way back from as long as you remember your humanity.",
        "The key is that Mendes (whose eclectic resume includes \"American Beauty\" and two Bond films, \"Skyfall\" and \"Spectre\") doesn't sacrifice the movie's heart in the service of its logistical considerations.",
        "This is war as a First Person Shooter, and it\u2019s incredibly effective at putting the viewer in the moment.",
        "The burning intensity of MacKay\u2019s face, reflecting the ferocity and futility of war, leaves an indelible mark. His fervor, coupled with the creative passion that Mendes infuses in every frame, makes 1917 impossible to shake.",
        "Mendes is intent on bringing a sense of breathless derring-do to a war only known for its doomed futility. And he loads onto it a one-take challenge, a rolling-back and slowly-swerving camera, using the sleight of hand which distinguishes the best action cinema of this kind.",
        "Even if the film is mostly hitting familiar notes in terms of story and theme, it expresses a concise, focused and expertly managed vision with which there\u2019s little to quibble, and the extraordinary style represents the fruition of a long-imagined dream on the part of many directors and cinematographers. From now on, when the discussion turns to great works of cinematography and camera operating, 1917 will always have to be high on the list.",
        "Basing the story on family history, Mendes\u2019 terrifying view of war is poetic and tragic, dreamlike without the forced stoner surrealism that too often afflicts war dramas. It is instead impressionistic, most especially in its highly structured cinematography.",
        "While occasionally the film wanders a bit too far into sentimentality (a scene involving a baby feels like it crosses a plausibility line), watching 1917 is an emotional and moving experience. You think of these two young men as one minuscule piece of an enormous tragedy, filled with individual stories.",
        "The movie stands out as one of the year\u2019s most memorable experiences.",
        "What makes the vivid film such an astounding effort \u2013 and one of the year's best movies \u2013 is that it\u2019s edited seamlessly as one continuous real-time take, following a couple of Brits through rat-infested trenches, sniper-filled towns and even empty battlefields where the Grim Reaper\u2019s been busy yet danger still looms.",
        "The clock is always ticking in 1917, and even as MacKay is offering a heartbreaking study in restrained emotion, he\u2019s still at least moving towards the end goal of his terrible task. There\u2019s no time to pause, even for great beauty, a lesson that even 1917 is often loathe to honor.",
        "It\u2019s an impressive cinematic accomplishment and a dandy bit of storytelling to boot.",
        "For all the steel-trap visceral efficiency, it\u2019s the more low-key moments that really pack a punch \u2013 those moments when we\u2019re confronted with the simple human cost of war.",
        "The film is a genre entertainment and, like all such beasts, it honours certain conventions and allows certain compromises.",
        "War is much on the minds of people right now, and 1917 is a good reminder, flaws and all, of what that really entails. The contradiction, of course, is that it is not one long slog through gorgeous sunsets, but a million little moments that make up the effort. That\u2019s kind of the movie Mendes made, and yet it\u2019s not. You want to feel a movie like this, but too often you simply appreciate it.",
        "Mendes has made a film that feels wholly alive. It\u2019s a carefully polished picture, not one that strives for gritty realism. But its inherent devotion to life and beauty is part of its power.",
        "Still, one needn\u2019t be British to feel the epic loss and grief of 1917, thanks to some very committed performances, the intimacy achieved by the movie\u2019s style and camera \u2014 the cinematographer is the celebrated Roger Deakins \u2014 and Mr. Mendes\u2019s obvious devotion to what he\u2019s doing.",
        "1917 doesn\u2019t solve the problem that was posed 100 years ago by the historical convergence of modern warfare and modern image-making technology. No movie can provide a final answer to the question of what it means to film a war. But Mendes\u2019 stunningly crafted entry in the genre will now become a part of a long history of imperfect representations of that unrepresentable conflict.",
        "Sam Mendes audacious WW1 epic is a sensational technical achievement, grounded by George MacKay\u2019s gritty intensity.",
        "Although 1917\u2019s filmmaking very much brings attention to itself, it\u2019s an astonishing piece of filmmaking, portraying war with enormous panache. This is big-screen bravado, and then some.",
        "We basically just get our orders and go. But I get the sense this is Mendes\u2019 point. His goal is to put us in World War I for two hours. And, no, it\u2019s not a pleasant experience. But what the movie is trying to do absolutely works. 1917 wants to take us to hell and back, and, in that, it succeeds.",
        "Astonishing as his filmmaking can be at times, it\u2019s Mendes\u2019 attention to character, more than the technique, that makes 1917 one of 2019\u2019s most impressive cinematic achievements.",
        "It\u2019s the lack of depth that ultimately may keep you from committing to 1917 or even respecting it \u2014 the movie\u2019s sense that war is simply something that happens to people rather than being caused by them. Don\u2019t forget that World War I was once called The War to End All Wars. It wasn\u2019t and according to the headlines it still isn\u2019t, but this movie never stops running to bother ask why.",
        "1917 is a movie\u2019s movie, more showpiece than insight, a kind of flashy sizzle reel of The Great War\u2019s horrors. It will rattle your speakers but probably not your soul. Nothing wrong with that, but better to know going in.",
        "By the time it ends, Mendes has built within the audience an intense desire to see the men\u2019s message successfully delivered, and like a true dramatist, Mendes milks it for every drop of tension. He does not blow his big finish.",
        "In the case of Sam Mendes\u2019s First World War thriller 1917, I am willing to concede that this is indeed a cinematic experience that demands the largest canvas possible.",
        "As 1917 goes on and the pair face a series of logistical challenges (navigating a collapsing bunker, crossing a bombed-out bridge), the film\u2019s form begins to resemble that of a video game\u2014only without the user interaction that makes games so compelling.",
        "1917 loses its urgency just enough to make you notice and wonder \u201cWhat are these two doing? Get BACK to the MISSION!\u201d",
        "1917 is a rattling wonder of form, an audacious undertaking that nonetheless bobbles or cheats on a few occasions.",
        "The movie is more successful as a thriller than as a thoughtful examination of war and its horrors; Mendes seems less interested in bigger ideas about the nightmare of battle and its effects on his characters than he is in Hitchcockian audience manipulation.",
        "1917 is worth checking out on a big screen for its visuals alone (Deakins' next Oscar nomination is all but assured), even though its immersive cinematography can, indeed, have the unintended side effect of making the movie seem like a video game at times. Still, there's a beating heart beneath the machinery that prevents it from being a hollow experience",
        "There are times when the nonstop visual momentum lends 1917 the feel of a virtual-reality installation, and others when the simulation of raw immediacy slips to reveal the calculated construct underneath.",
        "By the end, 1917 has positioned itself as a salute to the sacrifices of those who died for their country. Mostly, though, it comes across as a monument to itself.",
        "Sitting through it is like watching someone else playing a video game for two solid hours, and not an especially compelling one at that.",
        "1917 is impressive but oddly distancing; ultimately stirring but too often gimmicky.",
        "The most thrilling and haunting details here are actively undermined by the chief technical gimmick of the film.",
        "I can\u2019t recall the last time I was so staggered by a film\u2019s craftsmanship while feeling almost nothing else about it at all \u2013 little fear, less sadness, and barely a spark of actual excitement at anything beyond the high-wire nature of the filmmaking enterprise itself.",
        "While watching 1917, there\u2019s a sense that you\u2019re waiting for a fresh take or an interesting point that never comes. Audiences don\u2019t need this movie to tell them that war is hell. But for those striving to get closer to experiencing that hell, Deakins and Mendes achieve something few war films before them have. They just needed a grander reason for doing so.",
        "1917 is a noble, failed experiment in breaking the rules.",
        "It\u2019s the visual language of video games, but video games pull it off because that distanced voyeurism also comes with something additive: interactivity. Eventually, you will become involved. That is not something a film can offer.",
        "The artifice of the aesthetic premise overwhelms any of the film\u2019s other intentions.",
        "A carefully organized and sanitized war picture from Sam Mendes that turns one of the most catastrophic episodes in modern times into an exercise in preening showmanship.",
        "There is no sense of real danger, because the mission has to continue, if only to keep this impressive long shot going. Any time there\u2019s a larger, more cataclysmic set piece, our heroes look like tiny chess pieces on a much bigger board, bystanders who move around exploding mortars and whizzing bullets to produce the most stunning tableaux possible.",
        "The so-called long take serves as a mask\u2014a gross bit of earnest showmanship that both conceals and reflects the trickery and the cheap machinations of the script, the shallowness of the direction of the actors, and the brazenly superficial and emotion-dictating music score."

This is the fascinating fulcrum of \"1917\", not the inevitable technical virtuosity in \"Oscar bait\" function and still less a too often shameless playstation perspective, but the odyssey to deliver the counter-order to cancel an attack, the sense of spatiotemporal suspension, the deliberate following of (almost) empty moments, the persisted stalemates, \"The Wrong Move\" (\"False Bewegung\") of circularity, and that's what differentiates it from the journey of the soldier Bardamu, of Captain Willard, of Commander Bowman, of Captain Miller (Spielberg continues to produce Mendes with DreamWorks). \"I am a poor wayfaring stranger / While traveling thru this world of woe\".

Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) is summoned by his commanding general.  The allies have just received intelligence that their forces will be heading into a trap if they mount an offensive against the Germans the following morning.  Blake and Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) must go through enemy lines to deliver the message to the field commander, located nine miles away, to cancel the attack.  If they fail, 1,600 men, including Corporal Blake\u2019s brother, will be slaughtered.  The film follows the two corporals\u2019 peril-filled trek to hand-deliver the order and save the troops.Technically, this film is impeccable.  Long shots have been a Hollywood staple for years.  They\u2019re usually used to establish an environment.  In this case, long shots are used consistently to follow the action, offering a vast visual scope that is sometimes breathtaking.  The filming in \u201c1917\u201d is further complicated because Mendes often chooses to track the actors with a single camera that follows the action for several minutes and several hundred yards of movement without any apparent editing.  Given these challenges, \u201c1917\u201d is in many ways Cinematographer Roger Deakins\u2019 movie.  Deakins has 80 credits as a cinematographer, dating back to 1975.  His diverse body of work ranges from \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d to \u201cSkyfall\u201d to \u201cFargo\u201d to \u201cThe Big Lebowski.\u201d  For \u201c1917,\u201d he is favored to win a second Oscar.  His use of light and shadow in this film\u2019s night scene is nothing less than a master class.The acting is also first-rate.  As Schofield, George MacKay\u2019s haunted expressions, stilted gait and thousand-yard stare communicate clearly the costs of war, with no need for exposition to underline the point.  Familiar faces Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch lend their gravitas at key points.But ultimately, Mendes has made a war movie with a surprising air of detachment.  We learn little about the characters along the way, other than their single-minded determination to accomplish their goal.  We come to understand that this \u201cwar to end all wars\u201d was intensely personal, with enemies often shot up close, stabbed or even strangled with bare hands.  But commentary about this fact, or any larger points about war or human nature, is absent.  As a result, \u201c1917\u201d is a war film that\u2019s surprisingly bloodless.",

George Orwell's Homage to Catalonia or Beevors Stalingrad convey it more effectively. Or just watch old footage and photos. Soldiers in trenches always get live, are slee and food deprived. They all looked a little tii clean and healthy. I thought the plot had a few gaping holes Why didn't they just drop the orders off by and?

The two leads McKay and Chapman each have their breakout role here as two soldiers we follow and identify with throughout their journey, and the cameos of veterans such as Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch elevate the talent of acting in '1917'. Mendes and Deakins are one of the better creative teams in our modern filmmaking. To breathe new life into a dulled genre like war movies takes a true marvel but '1917' is just the film.

By bringing the war to the front row of the theater, audiences get to experience the terror of the conflict up close, a story capable of genuinely frightening viewers better than any of the best horror flicks on the market. The fine lead performances of George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman, combined by the stunning photography of Roger Deakins, the riveting score of Thomas Newman and the expert direction of Sam Mendes, combine to make this truly one of the year's best.

In a general sense, 1917 is somewhat reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan in that it gives its characters a clear goal with an easily discernible outcome. The film employs a technique that creates the illusion that everything is happening in real time with long takes. While this technique has been used in films with both small (A Boy. A Girl. A Dream) and larger budgets (Birdman), often with mixed results, it is very effective in this film. Even without cuts in the middle of each scene, the camera and action work so well together that the audience is always seeing what they need to see. That along with a very sophisticated use of CGI, makes you feel like you are right in the middle of the action. The result is an emotionally satisfying film with strong performances that doesn't let its use of technology get in the way of telling a good story. At just under two hours 1917 is the perfect length. You won't be bored and perhaps you will have a greater appreciation for the sacrifices made by soldiers in battle. Afterwards, checkout Peter Jackson's powerful documentary about World War I, \"They Shall Not Grow Old.\"",

This is an incredible piece of cinema!!!This movie is really a ride with sort of a dreamlike feel to it as the characters are taken from one unpredictable situation to another unable to know if they'll encounter friend or foe.Director Sam Mendes already showed in Skyfall that he commands an excellent visual style but this is a whole other level. The movie is filmed to give the illusion of one full tracking shot. Every moment the camera looks like it's following the characters. It is quite an achievement. Besides the tracking, the film also does a great job of deciding what elements of the scene to focus on.The scenery in this is a thing of ethereal beauty. The characters travel through a constantly shifting landscape, from trenches to abandoned farms and so forth. Even the worse of environments look good. In my opinion, the war torn town at night scene is one of the best images in film history.The one aspect that didn't always quite work for me was the music. Don't get me wrong. it's not bad. The issue is that the tracking shot gives a very natural, engrossing feel to what's going on. Suddenly, the music will boom loudly and take you out it.Overall, I highly recommend this.

While very impressive it doesn't make for the most impactful experience which cutting across time and space affords.

Colin Firth is always brilliant (best movie is A Single Man).  Honestly i got bored about 20 minutes in and just stayed there, the song ending the second act really drove that home.

While the mission seems virtually impossible, it's rendered even more incredible by director Sam Mendes' decision to shoot the film as if it were one continuous shot. Not only does this lend an urgency to the journey, but it boggles the mind to consider how some of the scenes were even staged/captured. The trek itself is full of setbacks that make the mission even more challenging for the soldiers and the viewer (if not a bit strained on credibility). Even though there is a continuous level of stress, the drama never has the poignant power that the story demands. As a result, this is a masterful piece of filmmaking that's impact is more technical than emotional.",

I have been a fan of Sam Mendes, who conquered me before with his first film \"American Beauty\"  and with \"Revolutionary Road\" and \"Skyfall\". These movie at the first instance do not share any obvious elements that allow us to characterize Mendes filmography, but what we can see is that in each of them and especially with 1917, it is that he is creating something so personal, proper, bright and at the same delicate, that as a spectator my only job is to sit and be marveled by his creations. He is a brilliant Director and one of the best for his generation. But not every triumph belongs to Mendes, because Roger Deakins is spectacular, perceptive, intuitive and performs the cynematography with brilliance and pure perfection (of course in the accepted limits, because that's where 1917 can have a bit of flaws and is that it does not have as much surprise factor as gender can sometimes merit it, it can be judged as too safe, but it doesn't matter because you see all the time surprised on how beautiful the film is). On the other hand, his cast led by the George Mackay promise is top-notch and the production design deserves multiple awards (the best of the year). In conclusion, it will be a epic war classic movie for further generation. Just as simple as that.",

This film is set in the midst of World War I in France, and follows two young British soldiers tasked with hand-delivering a message to their 2nd battalion that warns them to call off a planned attack that will lure them into an ambush set by the Germans. First off, what truly makes this film stand out is the nifty cinematography technique it employs. The film is 2 hours long, and it's filmed and edited to appear like one long continuous 2-hour shot (not unlike the best picture Oscar-winning film 'Birdman' from 5 years ago.) We literally follow these two young soldiers in real time from start to finish, with no cuts in between, adding to the film an even bigger sense of realism. But even setting aside this impressive technique, the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, and if this film deserves an Oscar for anything, it's the impeccable camerawork! Other great highlights of the film include its majestic musical score, as well as the acting from the two young soldiers, who make you feel like you're right in the middle of war with them with their realistic fear and performances. There were a couple of moments and stretches where the pacing slows down a bit much, but the one-take appearance does a solid job of making up for this and helped me stay fixated and invested in everything happening, and there was definitely a fair share of tense moments throughout too. Overall, it's undoubtedly a grand and truly unique war film, and one of the most harrowing and memorable ones I've seen in quite some time.",

Never have I seen cutaways from people and/or objects as lazy as that.Look, the thing about 1917 that confuses the hell out of me is why did Sam Mendes work (and boldly direct this big scale epic) with a script that feels like either a Jerry Bruckheimer movie or a Michael Bay movie, since sometimes it makes way for some unnecessary humor to it all because, I guess, we can't replicate the tone of Dunkirk or Hacksaw Ridge.Characters are just as one note as you'd think, sometimes it's overly serious (like, serious without making sense) and again, about Ec\u00f2ust, there's a scene that literally stops the plot for no reason other than \"squeeze the runtime more\".And what's most disappointing about this movie is Thomas Newman's Score. Now, I love the dude, he's made some of my favourite scores for Animated Movies (Finding Nemo and WALL-E), but there's almost no score in here. It has its moments (its few tension setups, and the character running scene seen in the trailer), but most of it is an annoying bass fest full of \"DUN DUN DUN DUNs\" that go on and on and on forever.But I salvage the movie nonetheless because the Artistic craft (Production Design and everything) is oh so gravy! From abandoned German mines to No Man's Land and just a **** of dead bodies surrounding the piece altogether...So, uhh... yeah. I'm shocked. I wanted to love 1917 as much as everyone else did, and I still hope it gets some Oscar attention, but if this really is the movie they went for...Mah. At least Deakins will be a 2 Time Oscar Winner?",

Yes, the story is very thin but that's something that made 1917 a somewhat different filmIt's not a war epic, nor does it try to be one. It's kind of a lone wolf war story, though at the beginning it wasn't like that, and that's good because despite everything that happens, the film doesn't lose that sense of camaraderie at the task that remains after the loss.1917 is a story of survival and that although it could not be considered completely original, that's totally the least of its problems because after all the experience is just spectacular.I admit the film has certain rhythm dropouts that I didn't like, especially the scene where Schofield loses consciousness, but at that point we are given the extraordinary night sequence, so my discomfort ended up disappearing.1917 is not a perfect film, but it's a reminder of how wonderful is to enjoy a film as they should be, even if it's a film that deals with the horrors of war.This is the kind of film that should be lived and experienced that way, otherwise it loses its resonance, so if you have the chance to see 1917 at a big screen do it.",

In reality, there are a lot more than two shots, but the edits have been digitally 'hidden', much like Birdman (2014) or Ut\u00f8ya 22. Juli (2018). And although I have some issues with it, I think Mendes has made an exceptional film, one in which form and content are tightly matched, with the style effectively delivering the story in a thematically justified manner.April 6, 1917; the Western Front. German forces have fallen back, and a pursuing British colonel believes that if he attacks now, he can turn the tide of the war. However, he's unaware that the Germans have fallen back to the heavily fortified Hindenburg Line and are lying in wait. With communication lines cut, two British Lance Corporals, Will Schofield (George MacKay) and Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) are assigned to physically carry an order calling off the following morning's attack. If they fail, 1,600 soldiers will be slaughtered.So, the film's big selling point is its aesthetic design. The use of the single-shot format is such a noticeable type of form that whenever it's used, it automatically places pressure on the content, which must justify why the film is shot this way, or the form becomes gimmicky. Think of Rope (1948) which was edited to look like one shot, or Victoria (2015), which was legitimately one shot. Very little in either film justifies the stylistic design. Compare this with one-shot films such as Russkij Kovcheg (2002) or the aforementioned Ut\u00f8ya 22. Juli, both of which tie form to content. And I think Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins achieve like synergy.Is the one-shot effect distracting? At first, yes, it is a little, especially if you're trying to spot where editor Lee Smith has hidden the transitions. But after sussing two edits in the first twenty minutes, I stopped looking, because I was just pulling myself out of the film unnecessarily. In essence, once you go with the aesthetic on its own terms, you forget about trying to spot the edits, instead letting the cinematography do exactly what it's supposed to do \u2013 immerse you.The opening scene is a superb introduction to the technique. The film starts with a shot of a daffodil field, before pulling back and revealing Schofield and Blake taking a break. They rouse themselves and begin walking, first past more resting soldiers, then the mess, then down a ramp into the trenches. We see the tactile transition from Edenic to hellish because we're moving in real-time through the milieu; we see the boundary between peace and war because the characters walk along that boundary. You shoot this sequence conventionally, and you undercut that.Along slightly more conventional lines, one has to commend Deakins's work during the nighttime scenes in \u00c9coust-Saint-Mein. As we pass through the ruined town, the only light is from flares creating very hard shadows in constant motion. The whole thing is almost otherworldly, and as the light traverses the sky, it's as if the ground itself is in motion. You won't find a better study in how to compose a sequence using light and shadow.Thematically, by its very nature, 1917 is far more focused on the micro than the macro \u2013 you might learn something about life on the front, but you'll learn nothing about the politics behind the conflict. Partly because of this, it avoids, for the most part, the kind of cartoonish jingoism that make films like Saving Private Ryan (1998) so obnoxious. Indeed, the protagonists' nationality is largely anonymous, which is not something you can usually say of a war film. On the other hand, you shouldn't expect too much psychological insight. The Thin Red Line (1998) it most definitely isn't.The story is unquestionably paper-thin, but that's by design. One criticism I did have, however, is how well-groomed Scholfield and Blake are. One only need watch They Shall Not Grow Old (2018) to see how unrealistic this is. Indeed, they look like they've just stepped out of the makeup trailer most of the time, and it's glaring enough to pull you out of things on occasion.All things considered though, I thoroughly enjoyed 1917. The single-shot strategy worked well, and even if the film is weak from a character/storyline/theme perspective, it didn't really matter when form and content are this well matched. It could have been an empty technical exercise, but Mendes hasn't allowed that to happen. The Great War was hell on Earth. 1917 doesn't make us feel what that hell was like. Because no art form can do that. But it's a very fine approximation.",

Slow to start, the first person perspective draws in the viewer,so we share the unfolding events and incidents alongside the two Tommies charged with their mission. It bears many similarities with Dunkirk (which was also more than just \"a war film\" and certainly not just a recount of a historical event).I was gripped, moved, drained, not just during the movie, but afterwards as well.

That would have been fine if this problem arose here or there, but it is a pervasive throughout.That said, the film does what it set out to do and it does it well.  It carries great emotional weight in certain places in part thanks to the uninterrupted shot style.  It is highly suspenseful in places.  It just doesn't tell much of a story;  It's sort of like designing an entire movie around a chase sequence.  People may be in imminent peril at all times, but there are no stakes for the audience unless you develop your characters so that we know them, empathize with them, and care about them.That is why the comparisons to Saving Private Ryan don't make sense to me....There was much, much more character development and story in Saving Private Ryan than in this film.  There was a simple objective in both, but far less plot linearity towards that objective in Saving Private Ryan.  Being limited to two characters in an unbroken shot also caused some awkward moments where the characters had to basically tell the audience what was happening instead of the film showing them, which was jarring and took me out of the moment.This isn't a bad movie.....but it isn't an all time great war movie either.  World War I was such a disastrously stupid war and it boggles my mind that no film to take up the subject to date has quite captured its utter folly or causes.  This film carries such a narrow focus it does not really do the war justice, in a sense.  It focuses on the glory and the bravery of the individuals who fought it (of which there was plenty) but glory can obfuscate the truth when it is removed from its context;  That truth here, where millions died for little to no good reason at all, and they knew it too.",

I want to say some of my thoughts on the film. I think the film deserves this assessment because it strongly touches on the theme of the horrors of war, which should now be shown in any movie about the war. Also, the plot here is not bad enough, but at the beginning we are somehow not brought up to date with everything that happens at the front. Therefore, a solid eight, I really liked the film, I advise everyone to go down who has at least some representation of the Great War",

Setting this aside, we are constantly reminded of the technical prowess (\"look at this trenchline that goes on forever\", \"what a beautifully lit night scene\"...) at the expense of any real sense of involvement and feelings apart from the death of the first protagonist. Some scenes are so caricatural and preposterous it reminded me of the worst in the Revenant. Some reviewers felt like in a computer game, and they are right!",
