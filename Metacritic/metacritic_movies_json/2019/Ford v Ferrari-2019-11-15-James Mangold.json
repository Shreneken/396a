    "critic_reviews": [
        "The movie is an old-fashioned rouser with a lot of new-fashioned virtuosity.",
        "It\u2019s a new and emotionally complex model of an old-fashioned audience-pleaser, with wonderful performances by Christian Bale and Matt Damon and a resonant soul to go with its smarts.",
        "A barnburner of a motion picture that mainlines heart-in-mouth excitement and tug-at-the-heart emotion, Ford v Ferrari is made the way Hollywood used to make them, a glorious throwback that combines a smart modern sensibility with the best of traditional storytelling.",
        "Ultimately, Ford v Ferrari is about art versus commerce, devotion versus cynicism, and inspiration versus deadness. It\u2019s one of the year\u2019s great films, and of all the great films so far, the most accessible.",
        "It stands with the greatest racing movies ever, and it\u2019s certainly the most entertaining. But there is no doubt about one last superlative.  Ford v Ferrari is one of the best pictures of the year.",
        "The chemistry between Bale and Damon is what makes the movie move the way it does, along with the script. Bale alone in the race car figuring out how to win and survive is where the film really sings.",
        "Shelby and Miles\u2019 story is compelling, but Mangold digs deeper to find the motor that propels Ford v Ferrari across the finish line.",
        "Ford v Ferrari is the sort of cinematic entertainment that sucks you in and won\u2019t let you go until you cross the finish line.",
        "You\u2019re going to watch Ford v Ferrari for the action, underdog story, and more-than-competent cast. Mangold also has the tone and pace of the film down perfectly. I would watch Ford v Ferrari over and over again.",
        "The movie works on you cumulatively, wearing down the impulse to roll your eyes at its familiar parts and leaving you to appreciate how snugly they fit together, and the way the whole thing purrs.",
        "Ford v Ferrari is a little too long; some scenes leave unnecessary skidmark trails. But the movie still has amiable style and energy to spare. It\u2019s fast but never furious.",
        "Bale is a cussed and calculating actor, yet he\u2019s never been more likable than he is here \u2014 an irony to relish, since the character he plays makes so little effort to be liked.",
        "Ford v Ferrari is almost as much about having to navigate having multiple bosses at a large corporation as it is winning a car race.",
        "The film\u2019s lively dynamics owe much to the bristly nature of nearly every relationship and interaction in the film.",
        "Whether you care about motorsports or not, Ford v Ferrari is a kick: both a rollicking true story well told, and a moving depiction of male friendship.",
        "Extremely enjoyable true-life drama featuring some of our most deft actors having the time of their lives.",
        "This infectious and engrossing story of the 1966 showdown on a French racetrack between car giants Ford and Ferrari is a high-octane ride that will make you instinctively stomp on a ghostly gas pedal from your movie seat.",
        "Ford v. Ferrari expertly captures the essence of mid-20th century racing, and the spirit of the men who went to battle in Le Mans.",
        "While there are plenty of obstacles and things going vroom, the two reasons \"Ford\" works so very well are named Damon and Bale: They're endlessly entertaining as loyal dudes who work out their differences through brotherly roughhousing.",
        "It\u2019s on the track where it finds traction. The events of the various races, reflected on the faces of characters whose lives revolve around the outcome, tell a story all by themselves.",
        "Ford v Ferrari is an easy film to scoff at; there is nothing new here, and there is no debating that fact. Instead, we have a compelling story told in simple, intelligent fashion. It deserves a spot on the list of great racing dramas, and the list of the year\u2019s most entertaining dramas.",
        "It\u2019s a movie so well put together as a hero\u2019s tale that it moves along almost too smoothly; the script by brothers Jez and John Henry Butterworth hits its marks of tragedy and triumph with a kind of shiny, measured inevitability.",
        "With its precise production design and rumbling racing scenes, Ford v Ferrari is as sleek and visually alluring as the vintage vehicles it showcases\u2014but beneath its shiny hood is an engine with real complexity.",
        "Slick, thrilling and saturated with vivid hues and 60s can-do optimism, Le Mans \u201966, James Mangold\u2019s follow-up to Logan, is a precision-tooled machine of a movie.",
        "Ford v Ferrari is no masterpiece, but it is \u2014 to invoke a currently simmering debate \u2014 real cinema, the kind of solid, satisfying, nonpandering movie that can seem endangered nowadays.",
        "Luckily, Mangold fuels his true-life plot with enough flesh-and-blood action to leave you dizzy.",
        "Even if you\u2019re not a motorhead, chances are you\u2019ll be thrilled by this high-velocity bromance, powered by zesty acting and Mangold\u2019s meticulous direction.",
        "It\u2019s the rare movie that doesn\u2019t trivialize a platonic male relationship with buddy film tropes.",
        "A fun, engaging story that\u2019s more about obsessive drive than actual driving.",
        "This is solid, middle-of-the-road entertainment. Slow patches aside, it finishes strong and, although it probably won\u2019t win the box office race, it may generate some Oscar interest (because Bale is almost always good enough to warrant that sort of attention).",
        "Damon is superb in the kind of role he excels at: a man of integrity who gets steered off the path and is subsequently righted. Lest all of this sound heavy, I should assure you that Ford v Ferrari is exactly as fun, maybe even more fun, than its well-put-together trailer makes it out to be.",
        "Setting aside more particular genre trappings, Mangold re-engineers one of his unfussy studio throwbacks into a supersized Dad Movie event.",
        "Ford v Ferrari works as a stylish, enjoyable mash note to its era, and the need for speed and all that.",
        "Damon and Bale are such magnetic onscreen figures that it doesn\u2019t take much to inject their various arguments, smarmy asides, and high-stakes bets with plenty of intrigue.",
        "Any misgivings bestowed upon Ford V Ferrari by the script are, more or less, eliminated by the film\u2019s big draw: the racing. Gloriously calibrated, simply designed, and modestly edited, audiences are reminded of the dynamite, nearly natural relationship automobiles share with filmmaking.",
        "It\u2019s behind the wheel with Miles that Ford v Ferrari becomes a well-oiled entertainment machine, a thrill ride with a driver\u2019s-eye view of the world\u2019s most exciting track. Everything that doesn\u2019t work is just a distant speck in the rearview mirror.",
        "Watching Bale and Damon channel those two speed freaks in all of their surly, testosterone-spitting glory is a reminder of how much fun it was to watch Bale play a similar character opposite Mark Wahlberg in \u201cThe Fighter.\u201d",
        "Ford v Ferrari is a classic Hollywood underdog film about friendship and overcoming obstacles. Mangold\u2019s direction is serviceable, but unspectacular, while Bale is a dynamic presence.",
        "If only director James Mangold had taken the route the Wachowskis did with \u201cSpeed Racer,\u201d which had psychedelic colors to spice things up.",
        "Ford v Ferrari\u2019s narrative and emotional beats feel assembled in a factory-floor kind of way. The characters are stock, the story\u2019s ups and downs are easily telegraphed, and the inoffensive but not particularly inventive dialogue is spat up as if the actors were eager to move onto the next thing.",
        "At a time when the nation continues to weigh the fate of its auto industry, James Mangold\u2019s depiction of the Ford Motor Company facing its first major financial threat transparently plays to nostalgic reveries of the industry\u2019s golden age.",
        "It is intermittently a blast, particularly when Bale and Damon ham it up with each other, trading jabs and one-liners, and having childish slap fights in broad daylight as Miles\u2019 saintly, patient wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) quietly observes. But when it isn\u2019t a blast, Ford v Ferrari is politically muddled to the point of distraction.",
        "Damon and Bale are unfailingly enjoyable company to be among, steering the psychology away from alpha-male dominance to something more complex and occasionally mystical.",
        "Ford v Ferrari is well acted and shot, but the story doesn\u2019t engage, making James Mangold\u2019s latest effort something of a slog.",
        "Two immensely enjoyable central performances and some of the best race sequences yet filmed fuel an otherwise standard sports movie.",
        "Though it\u2019s bolstered primarily by the charisma of Bale and Damon\u2019s performances, the soulless yet thrilling Ford v Ferrari doesn\u2019t provide much more than huffy banter, corporate rivalry, and an adrenaline rush. The real-life characters deserve more than that.",
        "It is crammed with unearned emotional moments and factory-built male characters whose dedication to their sport we are expected to find adorable and heroic by turns."

This is pure cinema Hollywood at its best! Christian Bale gives yet another incredible performance as Ken Miles and gives the near-perfect act for an Oscar nomination. All the other roles played by Matt Damon, Jon Bernthal, Tracy Letts, and Josh Lucas all are stellar. One gripe I do have with the film, however, is the slightly slower-paced sequences in non-racing areas. I think the film dragged rather than raced in those portions. But when the film raced, literally, my heart was pumping and I was nearly sweating out of exhaustion! James Mangold gives possibly a Best Director nomination-worthy job, period. All in all, this is an A-tier, one of the best 2019 movies, and an instant classic for me.",

I watched it on IMAX (laser), the engine sounds and screeching felt so good, the cornering was exhilarating, the shifting and throttling finally make sense in a racing film, and the music was there pumping hard, my wife was even humming it on the way back to the car. All these alone pay the ticket if you love driving, furthermore, you know you experienced a great racing adventure if after the film you go back to your car and hear your car engine with more affinity, feel the cornering more natural and have the sensation your Prius is really slow, but suddenly you realize that you are going 85 thinking is 55.Why 8.5 as a film in general? The cinematography was lacking, there was no worldbuilding whatsoever: shots around houses, labs, testing/racing tracks, and even cities were missing or only stills, and way too many short cuts to deliver an event such as pass or tight corner. Story-wise, it is based on real events, so saying the plot is obvious, it is a dumb thing to say. The acting is top-notch: Bale always creates a character that makes you forget about him in a snap, with incredible powerful deliveries left and right; Damon is always Damon, likable AF, he is like Tom Hanks at this point, you are just happy to see him on screen doing his thing; The Punisher is great too, he came and punched his way through. That being written, Ken's wife and child are \"the\" rockstars (I won't pretend I remember their names), every scene that was around them was really powerful, it shows that Mangold strives on getting the best of the best, and this pair has a bright future ahead.Bloody hell, go on and watch it already!",

Of course, this car was the GT40, and the rest is history. Going into this and judging from most of the trailers, I knew it was probably gonna follow the standard biopic tropes and be crowd-pleasingly predictable at times... And it was! However, that definitely didn't change how much fun I had with this film regardless. It's got all the racing and car scenes auto-buffs will definitely be all over, and even the non-car enthusiasts just looking for a thrilling ride of a story likely won't be disappointed. It didn't feel too long despite its 2.5 hr runtime, but there were definitely a handful of filler scenes that felt a bit longer than necessary. Acting-wise, Damon and Bale make a great team and bring plenty of charm to the film with their performances. Overall, despite its predictability with many of the story elements, the same can't be said for the racing sequences (especially in the second half), which had me on the edge of my seat, and Damon and Bale without a doubt work together great alongside one another to make this ride a highly entertaining one!",

It's the kind of film that appeals to a specialty audience, despite its human angle, so, if you're not into auto racing, this probably isn't for you. However, for those who enjoy the subject matter and appreciate such things as great speedway action footage, this is one of the best films ever made about the sport.

Shelby is the inspired engineer.  Miles is the irascible wildcard.  Henry Ford II is the cutthroat Man of Industry \u2026 and they even give him a sniveling bulldog lackey.The second half of the film picks up the pace and is considerably more engaging.  Mangold does a fine job filming the racing scenes, choosing just the right balance of different viewpoints and cuts.  Beyond that, he thankfully spares audiences from the awful \u201cshaky camera effect\u201d that some filmmakers would\u2019ve used anytime they wanted to ramp up the action on screen.Given that the \u201824 Hours of Le Mans\u2019 race is indeed twenty-four hours long, Mangold also excels at keeping an even pace down the final stretch, not relying too much on either the racing or the off track drama, but rather striking an even balance between the two.",

Le Mans \u201966 an exhilarating trill ride from start to finish and I enjoyed every minute of it.The art of good story telling is creating something that anyone can enjoy, you don\u2019t have to know a whole lot about cars and racing to appreciate Le Mans \u201966. I\u2019m sure all you car nuts out there will get a little more out of this film but when you break it down, Le Mans \u201966 is an exciting real life story jam packed with intense racing sequences and some unexpected emotional moments. The racing scenes are all real and not relying on computer generated effects and the results pay off. Nail biting drama, extremely immersive and will have you on the edge of your seat. But for me what pushes this movie into five star territory is the relationship between Christian Bale and Matt Damon. Genuine and humorous with electric chemistry.I knew virtually nothing about the story before seeing Le Mans \u201966 and I really feel this added to the drama. Whether you\u2019re interested in racing or not I can promise you\u2019ll enjoy this film. A truly gripping story with two brilliant central performances from Damon and Bale. Thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended.",

Though the many scenes of fast driving do add some adrenaline, the film has to rely on a dramatic arc that hinges on the possibility of building a fast car and getting the right driver. Unfortunately this dilemma advances all too predictably, and features static characters in cookie-cutter relationships that feature no real tension and no development whatsoever. The characters are drawn well enough to elicit a few laughs at unexpected juxtapositions, but mostly they just go through the motions, and we literally hear the same overblown lines at the end of the film as we do at the beginning, as though the film wanted to remind viewers that nothing actually happens in between. Some nice period touches and decent turns by some supporting actors working with limited material demonstrate that the filmmakers were at least trying, but the flat relationships and tepid dialog keep things moving at a snooze. Maybe watch it on an airplane if there's nothing better?",

Matt Damon plays the sports car designer who teams up with a famous driver (Christian Bale) for the titular challenge. This film is less about driving and more about the team's drive to win, including the technical challenges and the duo's head-to-head combat with the management of Ford. Most of the racing is saved for the big event, which is masterfully captured and downright riveting. The leads create a compelling duo, but the entire cast is makes this movie work. Director James Mangold keeps the dialogue and conflicts involving, while expanding their personal lives to give extra heft to the drama. A smart and compelling look at hard competition and the will to win.",

Based on a true story, the screen writers Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller, juggle 4-5 different stories to add human drama to the film while eliminating any one of them would have brought the movie in at a reasonable showing time, way less than the 2 hours and 30 minutes it runs.At the same time the director James Mangold has one too many race scenes, one too many shots of a foot hitting the brakes, more shots than necessary to prove Ken Myles is eccentric or business owners and their employees can be  underhanded and ruthless. Caitriona Balfe, though a bit difficult to understand, impressed me playing the wife of Christian Bale, who as driver Ken Myles, has been getting raves for his role, left me cold and also hard to understand. Matt Damon is, as always, impressive in a strong, somewhat silent way, as former champion driver and now designer of race cars. Tracy Letts in the role of Henry Ford II has a 2 minute moving and at the same time funny scene while being solid in the rest of the film. Josh  Lucas as the boss's right hand man is an effective villain even if the role is a bit overwritten and obvious.The banter between Damon and Bale tells a lot about both men but one segment, meant to be funny is only funny due to the reaction of Balfe while Bale's scenes with Noah Jupe, just right as his son, shows the man to be a good father.The behind the scenes of business life certainly isn't new but the behind the scenes of the racing sport and business aspect of it and car companies is interesting.Though you may know who the winner is, or will be, in \"Ford v Ferrari\" it will entertain you if you can get through the 30 to 40 minutes unnecessary segments.",

While biographic films might be boring at times, Mangold kept the pace well enough to let us feel the bond between Ken Miles and Carrol Shelby, whom despite obstacles mounting both from within the Ford Motors and the races itself, still manages to make the best out of the situtation to prevail against odds.

From 'Walk theIt has become apparent to me that James Mangold is probably one of the most under-appreciated directors of our time. This is a filmmaker who has made some fascinating films and many people probably don't know they were by him. From 'Walk the Line' (2005), '3:10 to Yuma' (2007) and even 'Logan' (2017), he has made some fantastic films, and has a very good eye in how he approaches his storytelling. Here, with 'Ford v Ferrari', he uses Matt Damon and Christian Bale (surely to get some Oscar consideration for his work) as the two leads to tell the story of how Carroll Shelby (Damon) persuades Ken Miles (Bale) to compete in a race against Ferrari by driving a Ford. Shelby designs cars, and wants to team up with Ford to make the best race car possible. The big company knows that they can't remain financially stable if they keep making car after car. They need style and they need to keep up with competition, but most importantly, they need a reputation. Shelby uses Miles as a way to promote the Ford race cars as he is clearly the best racer out there. Their friendship, their bond is what keeps this movie lifted throughout. The screenplay, written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller keeps these two central characters interesting when they're apart and when they're together. They know that Damon and Bale can work around the dialogue and that their chemistry is vital to the story. The racing sequences are also some of the best you'll see on screen. This movie can get a little long from time to time, so it can be hard to keep interested, but the acting, the chemistry, the racing and just the overall drama, with hints of comedy sprinkled here and there, is enough to keep you invested. It's sure enough that Bale will score another Oscar nomination for his work, hopefully, Mangold can get a \"Best Director\" nomination for his work here. It's a film and a story that deserves to be seen.",

Not for the quality but because I was worried that the story wasn't going to justify the whole two and a half hours. But Ford v Ferrari surprises and ends up being a rather entertaining and intense experience.James Mangold is armed with two solid Christian Bale and Matt Damon to provide a story that in addition to being interesting and exciting also has a pleasant dose of humor, irony and sarcasm in something that could lend itself to be more dramatic.While it's true the film shines and is much better in the scenes that involve the car races, it manages to balance in a good way all the narrative aspects of the story, like the ones that include the corporate elements with Ford and its bureaucracy, the scenes that show us how they achieved the mechanical improvements of the car, to the link and friendship between Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby.All this compensates both sides of the balance achieving a good pace that doesn't allow the argument or interest to decline. As I said it's two and a half hours long and I didn't feel them and believe me, that's hard to achieve.I really didn't plan on awarding it an 8 because I didn't really like the ending.I feel that it didn't do justice to the story and how it had been built up to that moment and it's not that it falsified an event that really happened, it's simply that it didn't feel in tune with the rest, but considering all the other stuff and the good time I had watching it, it deserves the 4 stars.I expected something good and it was therefore Ford v Ferrari deserves the recognition and the attention.",

The fantastic performances from the leads (Matt Damon and Christian Bale) will really make you connect with their characters and follow their journey.

The humor doesn't affect the tone, because, like I said, it feels natural and not forced for the sake of having humor. While the performances from basically every actor of the cast are really good (not as good as the leads, tho), some of the characters felt like cartoons. Sometimes there are moments that get over the top and feel like they belong better in a dumb comedy film, but those moments don't happen too often and the tone remains consistent (Those moments are entertaining tho, but I felt them out of place). The music feels like stock music downloaded from YouTube, and I feel like the racing sequences would've been a lot more intense with less music. Speaking about the racing sequences; They are amazing. The great cinematography and nice editing really helps to capture the races clearly. There wasn't a single moment in the races where I couldn't understand what was going on. Everything was shown nice and clear. The sound design and the sound mixing were fantastic and really helped make the races intense.Overall this is a really good movie: It has stunning technical aspects and great performances, but I feel like some characters, the music and some writing choices could've been better.",

I loved the hell out of this movie. My all-time favourite actor, Christian Bale, brings his A-game to this movie. Oscar nomination is incoming. Matt Damon also brings his A-game; this is probably the best I've seen from him. Bale and Damon's chemistry is fantastic too; I wouldn't mind seeing them work again in another movie. Jon Bernthal, Caitriona Balfe, Tracy Letts, Josh Lucas and Noah Jupe round out the cast and are brilliant in their roles. The movie is written well too. The writers portrayed the friendship between Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and Caroll Shelby (Matt Damon) well. They also brilliantly captured the family dynamics involved with racecar drivers, a frighteningly dangerous sport, in that era in particular. They even captured the politics involved in working for a giant like Ford excellently, bringing tension and also humour to the story. One scene involving Enzo Ferrari, giving his opinion about the Ford team is a highlight, so too the responding scene involving Henry Ford II. I can't praise the film enough on the technical front. The score by Marco Beltrami and Sanders captures the intensity of the races perfectly. The cinematography is gorgeous from start to finish. The directing is f'n fantastic, masterful even, James Mangold take a bow. What a movie he put together. The race scenes were freaking amazing. In particular, the Le Mans sequence. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and I sincerely believe it should go down as one of the best sequences in film, period. There is a bit in that sequence that should earn Bale an Oscar nod on its own. I can't recommend this movie enough. It's one of the best of 2019, a year that seems to keep on giving.",

This is an effective, thrilling, intuitive and enjoyable dissertation on perseverance, friendship, and the neverending battle between creativity and big business, featuring two dynamite performances from both Bale and Matt Damon. Yes, it's a tad safe, and it does tend to play a little loose with certain aspects of truth. However, if I'm being honest, I'm not necessarily sure there's a dire upshot in smoothing over a few edges here and there, especially in a story that bears little to no impact on current circumstances, events, or political movements. It's not as though this is a biopic of one of modern society's formative figures, or even an allegorical exploration into the underpinnings of some of today's issues. We're talking about the difference between cheating during the Super Bowl and cheating in a game of Jenga. That's not to say this movie bears no weight of any kind, though, as all forms of technicality on display (i.e. sound design/mixing, cinematography, stunt work, etc.) help remind you that this at times a life or death pursuit.

It\u2019s a good thing that we\u2019re now getting Oscar-bait movies that feel like they were made to have fun with it, both story-wise and production-wise (besides Tarantino fare), instead of just being made to put serious effort and care into the story and the production (coff coff, Downton Abbey\u2026). Actually, scratch that. This doesn\u2019t even feel like an Oscar-bait. This is basically James Mangold at his most free for directing purposes. To the point to where they also confirm that Mangold will do about anything to plug the Western aesthetic into his multi-genre movies (we\u2019ll talk about that later). I can say that Ford V Ferrari is fun and I\u2019d finish the review here, but I can\u2019t, because I\u2019m shocked that Fox went there and consumed $100M to transform such a story-changing event (for racing fans) into a big-ass thrill-a-ride packed to the brim with exquisite IMAX-worthy racing scenes and a really sweet and poignant dad/son story in a movie about building cars. Not only that but also delivering us one of the best movie villains I\u2019ve ever seen on screen, Leo Beebe (played by Josh Lucas), the Director of the whole Le Mans project, AKA that one Executive who will try ruining it too because he hates Ken Miles so much.Lucas brings in enough rage and menace to this character, and he makes it to where he also becomes one of the more hateful characters in the picture. The lengths and forces he\u2019ll go to make sure he tells anyone not to let Miles race feel like he's just ranting on him only based off of a funny banter between the two.The main cast is great too, especially Christian Bale as Ken Miles, the cocky idiot who loves going the extra mile who also has quality time with his son. Great stuff that pays off beautifully in the end.It\u2019s a shame I didn\u2019t catch this in IMAX, because, as said, the Racing scenes are thrilling and intense, especially the final race. Cars leaping and crashing left and right, the rage of the motors and constant speed...all accompanied by excellent editing that adds more pedal to the metal (I suppose brakes were harmed during the production of this movie).I\u2019m struggling to write a coherent review for it, but sometimes it\u2019s the case for these types of movies. While not really one with the source material it\u2019s based off, I still had a blast seeing some dudes building cars for 2h32\u2019 (which doesn\u2019t even feel like 2 hours). Ford V Ferrari felt more or less like 9 Year Old me enjoying the crap out of a Happy Meal mix,where,even if they had Hamburgers and McNuggets (that being the Racing scenes and Ford \"going to war\"), there were some other real nice treats,like Mini-Carrots and Fruit Juice (the Father and Son relationship).I can't believe I had this much fun at it, and it'll definitely be one I'll be rooting for at the Oscars.",

It looks nice and the pacing is pretty smooth for a two-and-a-half hour movie. Director James Mangold (Logan, Walk the Line) really knows how to make scenes visually interesting, throwing in little stuff. Though there isn't really that much racing in this, the race at Le Mans really pays off your expectations.Matt Damon and Christian Bale are the leads in this, the former being the guy who tries to work within the system and the latter being the guy who can't. Matt Damon gives a fine performance, but it's Bale who steals every scene he's in. The famously versatile actor completely sells the character of driver Ken Miles, both brash but charismatic. I'll be very surprised if he doesn't get an Oscar nomination. To be honest, the casting even to the smallest characters is pretty darn good. Props should be given to Tracy Letts as tough, intimidating boss Henry Ford II.The only weak spot I found, and it's more of a knitpick, is that they could've cut down on the scenes of Miles interacting with his family. It's good stuff, but it can be a little repetitive.Overall, I highly recommend this.",

The ending wasn't bad it just didn't end on a happy note. Ken Miles was such a good character but he gets screwed over by Ford. They make him slow down so the other two Ford race cars can catch up so they can cross the finish line together. And then they say one of the other two drivers won. And after that in a pointless scene Ken Miles crashes while practicing and I think he died. They kind of implied it. So I dont love that ending because it's kind of depressing.

So rare when everything, everyone, cries for one lap. One perfect lap.Ford V FerrariThe director James Mangold is deservedly and in my case surprisingly in the lead in the Oscar race for the Best Direction trophy. And I am including the best of this year's most controlled films. There are many indie films that packs a linear, safer and comforting punch than this at-times-commercial-yet-fully-artsy drama. I have never seen him so confident and empowering on screen. And not to forget his large chunk of the film spends time on the road, in the run, at the face of Bale's snide-y looks that resembles to me with that mysterious Alfred Borden way of scanning out from The Prestige.With a whoosh the film goes by like the Ferrari(!) and speaks mostly, structure wise, a pretty standard tale. Not at all biography but sports alike, the film feels. You are aware of where and how things would go and yet Mangold insists to you to experience these moments with this incredibly rich cast. Those tiny moments where it flowers you with flood of imaginative thoughts and ideas that scares and educates you, is the best asset of the film.The nuanced performance then and then only emerges up, visible to the naked eye, teary eye by then. The helps that Matt Damon provides, the rejoicing moment between a husband and a wife after landing a well paid job and Christian Bale's performance staged, framed, mostly around his face, are the moments where you go through a religious experience of discovering cinema in a nail-biting match about patience. Another thing about Ford V Ferrari that caught me by surprise was how both the lead roles were actually underdog characters. That doesn't happen everywhere. No one dares.",

It's a sport biopic of sorts with the characters of Ken Miles played by Christian Bale and Carolle Shelby playedFord v Ferrari (AKA Le Mans 66 in some European countries) is a story based on the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari in the 60s. It's a sport biopic of sorts with the characters of Ken Miles played by Christian Bale and Carolle Shelby played by Matt Damon of course being real individuals. The story of course exaggerates lots of things for the sake of dramatisation even more than other films so it isn't necessary a typical biopic. The film is directed by James Mangold who directed the masterful film \"Logan\" but the film certainly feels drastically different from Logan. Still, I came in with high expectations because James Mangold directed it and plus all the oscar buzz around the film.Firstly, the story is very compelling and engaging for a film about racing cars. The human drama between the Ford executives and the main characters is very natural albeit cliche. However, the director manages to balance out the racing with the human drama naturally so that none become too overwhelming or boring. Despite being titled \"Ford v Ferrari\" the film is more about the clash of Miles and Shelby against the meddling executives. The heart and passion of Miles/Shelby with the cold and calculative business choices of the executives is really the heart and soul of the film with some added bonus of intense racing. There are a lot of poignant and genuinely heart warming touching moments but with some funny moments and that is not normal for these type of films. Secondly, Both Christian Bale and Matt Damon give great performances with strong chemistry between the two that makes the friendship more believable. The supporting cast Jon Berthal, Caitriona Balfe,Tracy Letts give good performances as well and definitely do well in making the world more alive. Special mention to Josh Lucas who I say is the REAL antagonist of this film by somehow being suave but absolutely detestable. Thirdly, the race scenes are incredibly done and intense with great wide shots and none of the shaky camera garbage. The film really excels at creating exciting and thrilling auto action which is in part thanks to excellent score by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders. The score captures the electrifying race scenes but also uses score and music from the 60s to elevate the era the film is set in.Likewise, the sound and sound editing in this film are done perfectly as I could feel the engine turning or when the gears change. It's just really good.I do have some issues with this film and the first is the amount of cliches used by this film. The monologue at the beginning being used at the end again, Ken Miles being the typical cliche underdog character from a sports film, the montage with the amount of failures, the main character knowing more than the experts and machines etc. The cliches are done masterfully but it did surprise me a lot about how many cliches were in this film. My other minor issue has got to be the run time which is at 152 minutes. The pacing of this movie is mostly fine but there are certain points in this movie after they build the car where it just kind of drags. These are mostly in the scenes where there are paperwork or meetings where it just feels a bit too long for no reason. Other than some minor nitpicks, the movie is almost near perfect. The film is carried by great performances with thrilling car scenes but some genuinely touching and funny moments. The movie drives you along a road of contrasting emotions that leads you to an exciting finishing line. Give this film a watch.",

Baime's Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans (2009), written by Jason Keller,I'd have preferred to see Michael Mann's version, but this is an impressive and heartfelt study of friendshipBased on A.J. Baime's Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans (2009), written by Jason Keller, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth, and directed by James Mangold, Le Mans '66 (released in North American with the equally generic title of Ford v Ferrari) counts Michael Mann as an executive producer. This is notable, as Mann has been trying to bring an adaptation of Brock Yates's Enzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races (1991) to the screen since 1993. Mangold is a fine director, but he's no Mann, and the film could never be accused of breaking any new ground or trying anything original. It is, in essence, a thematically broad and aesthetically anonymous pre-auteur theory audience-pleaser made with the aesthetic sensibilities of modernity. But whilst the individual parts may be unsatisfactorily safe and familiar, the whole is accomplished and enjoyable.The film begins in 1959 as Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) wins that year's Le Mans, only to be told he has a heart condition and must stop racing. Cut to 1963, and Henry Ford II (a superb Tracy Letts) determines to build a car capable of winning Le Mans, which Ferrari has won in 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963. Ford Vice President and General Manager Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) reaches out to Shelby to design a car, but he says they'll need a great driver as well as a well-designed car. So, he reaches out to Ken Miles (Christian Bale), one of the best drivers in the world, renowned for his ability to identify problems in test cars after only one or two laps. However, because of his volatility, few want to work with him. He comes on board, but immediately clashes with Ford Senior Executive Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas).Le Mans '66 is somewhat similar to Michael Mann's Ali, insofar as it uses the grandiose moments of history to tell an intimate story - Mangold uses the determination to win Le Mans '66 as the background against which to examine issues such as friendship and the clash between gifted individuals for whom success is its own reward and corporations who don't see value in anything unless it's monetarily successful. Indeed, the argument could be made that the film is actually a commentary on the Hollywood studio system, with Shelby and Miles representing independent filmmakers who love the craft and see the medium as an art-form, whilst the Ford executives represent the studio, always more concerned with the bottom dollar than artistic integrity, always getting in the way of the people who, if left alone to work, could produce something spectacular.This thematic focus, however, is not to say the film ignores the intricacies of racing; on the contrary, there's a huge amount of techno-babble concerning vectors, aerodynamics, the mathematics of torque, the torsion of metal, and the ins and outs of physics. Additionally, the aesthetic design of the races is exemplary, albeit familiar, with Mangold, cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, and sound designers David Giammarco and Jay Wilkinson crafting some truly intense moments. For the most part, there are no objective shots (for example, there are no overheads giving us a good vantage of the entire race), and there are very few shots showing us something that Miles is unable to see, which creates the sense of being in the car with him, adding a default level of intensity.In terms of problems, there are only two of any significance. The first concerns just how safe and rudimentary the film is. Aesthetically, although the race scenes are kinetic and exciting, there isn't anything new or inventive in them; thematically, the film doesn't say anything we haven't heard before; and structurally, it walks a very well-worn path \u2013 chances are that everything that you think might happen in Le Mans '66 does happen. This is your basic underdog story, and it adheres rigidly to that template. This is seen most clearly in the character of Beebe, the film's token villain (you can't have an underdog story without a token villain). A Swiss army knife character he is a one-size-fits-all bad guy without an iota of nuance or interiority. The second problem concerns Shelby, who's one-dimensional (at best), as we learn absolutely nothing about his personal life. Who is the film's Carroll Shelby, and why should non-racing fans care about him? We never get an answer.Although these issues are significant in isolation, Le Mans '66 is so well made, it rises above the clich\u00e9d and overly-familiar nature of many of the individual scenes, resulting in a whole that is much more than the sum of its parts. It doesn't take any risks, nor does it bend any rules, but for all that, I couldn't help but enjoy it. It won't surprise you, it probably won't move you, it certainly won't change your life, but it's a journey well worth taking.",

In the capable hands of Director James Mangold (\u201cWalk the Line,\u201d \u201cLogan\u201d), \u201cFord v Ferrari\u201d is one of those films.The story, based on true events, centers on Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), a car designer, showman and entrepreneur, and veteran driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale), a plain-spoken Englishman obsessed with automotive perfection.  After Ford\u2019s unsuccessful effort to purchase the dominant Ferrari race team in 1962, Ford management hired Shelby-American in 1965 with a goal of winning the 24 Hours at Le Mans, the world\u2019s premier automobile endurance race.  After abject failure their first year, the driving team led by Miles won the endurance races at Sebring and the 24 Hours at Daytona in 1966 leading up to the race at Le Mans, the film\u2019s climactic scene.When Damon and Bale are together on the screen, that alone is well worth the price of admission.  However, they are ably supported by a strong cast including Caitriona Balfe (\u201cOutlander\u201d TV series) as Miles\u2019 wife and Tracy Letts (the long-suffering father in \u201cLady Bird\u201d) as Henry Ford II, whose screams and facial expressions when he experiences his first ride in a race car almost steal the show (regrettably, this scene is apparently apocryphal).  The storyline explores the fine line between persistence and obsession, the role of individualism in a corporate culture and, most of all, the overwhelming power of friendship.With its budget of $97 million, \u201cFord v Ferrari\u201d strives for faithful re-enactment throughout the film.  Despite a daunting script that calls for shooting several extensive race scenes (the last scene at Le Mans clocks in at 25 minutes) and multiple spectacular crashes, the creative team elected not to use CGI.  They assembled as many cars from the period as possible, then supplemented them with faithful replicas, particularly of the Ford GT40.  One person has estimated that some of the Le Mans scenes had race cars valued at over $200 million on the track at the same time.  Several key elements of the story are rendered equally faithfully.It\u2019s only a minor distraction, but the inevitable conflict between Shelby\u2019s team and the \u201csuits\u201d from Ford seems quite forced.  And from several reports, it\u2019s not entirely accurate.  Similarly, the race results sometimes have been altered to increase dramatic effect (which makes sense, because the outcomes of most endurance races are apparent long before the race concludes).\u201cFord v Ferrari\u2019 is a throwback film in the best possible sense.  It\u2019s well worth the time of contemporary audiences.  It\u2019s one of the best films of the year.",

It has all the elements of a traditional major studio sports movie: based on a true story, A-list movie stars, acclaimed journeyman director, fabulous cinematography, a motley crew of characters challenging conventions, an underdog angle. A more generous analogy would be Ford v Ferrari takes a reliable recipe and uses the best ingredients and best kitchen brigade to deliver an entr\u00e9e so well done it is almost easy to dismiss. That is almost what happened with this movie. After coming and going at the box office just before Thanksgiving, it seems the Academy couldn\u2019t dismiss this film entirely and gave it four Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. They were right to not let Ford v Ferrari pass without notice because, though it is working with a familiar recipe, this is an excellently done, engaging entertainment.Like the title directly states, this movie is about rival car companies. Specifically, it is about the nascent Ford racing program in the mid 1960\u2019s taking on the dominant force in international racing, Ferrari. Like a lot of sports movies, you could argue that this movie isn\u2019t so much about the sport but about the characters and their journey. Ford v Ferrari is certainly about car racing but what is most engaging about it is the friendship between its main characters, racer turned car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale). After a slump in sales, ambitious Ford executive Lee Iacocca hatches a plan to revitalize the car company's image by entering the world of international auto racing and winning the prestigious marathon race 24 Hours at Le Mans. Ford turns to Shelby to head their racing program. Shelby, turns to the best driver he knows, Miles, who is the right driver for the job but does not fit the Ford company image.At first the accents from the leads are a bit jarring. Damon is using a full Texas drawl and Bale uses a British accent not his own. Accents aside, Damon and Bale settle into the their characters quickly and comfortably. They are A-list stars that give A-list performances with great on-screen chemistry. Damon as the determined no-nonsense Shelby and Bale as the skilled but at times abrasive Miles (he\u2019s described as \u201cnot a people person\u201d) are not exactly a mismatched pair; they\u2019re more like yin and yang. Their best scene together is also the funniest in the movie: they fight each other with groceries. Shelby has a canned good in his hand, realizes that it would hurt Miles, so he hits him with a loaf of bread instead. Even when they are trying to hurt each other, they are trying not to hurt each other.The real rivalry isn\u2019t between Ford and Ferrari but with race crew and the Ford executives who don\u2019t understand racing and are only concerned with corporate image, namely Josh Lucas as Leo Beebee. Lucas is great performer but there\u2019s nothing to his character aside from being petty and obstructing Shelby and Miles. I did not care about the Ford motor company winning a race to gain prestige and sell more cars so rich men could be slightly richer. But I did care about Shelby and Miles succeeding. Watching them and their crew work together to solve the problems of building a state-of-the-art race car, with each member using their individual skills and knowledge, is a total delight. Those scenes reminded me of other film about people working together to solve a problem, The Martian, also starring Matt Damon, and also a Best Picture nominee. So, yes, in a film where the title flat out states conflict and rivalry, the best scenes are of people working together.Director James Mangold is not a household name, even among cinephiles, but he turns out solid work more often than not. He uses the same approach with Ford v Ferrari\u2019s racing scenes. There some shots of the cars zooming by the stands but there are also shots behind and in front of the cars on the track, inside the car with the Miles, POV shots of the racers, or shots where the camera has been attached the door of one of the speeding cars. It is all cut together to thrilling results (editor Andrew Buckland received an Oscar nomination for his work). Ford v Ferrari also picked up Oscar nominations in both Sound Mixing and Sound Editing. The sound of the roaring engines, zooming cars, and, yes, explosions, are a major part of the immersive experience of the racing scenes. I have never had any interest in car racing of any kind, but the grueling climatic race at 24 Hours at Le Mans, where drivers race in four-hour shifts day and night no matter the weather conditions, had me completely enthralled. That\u2019s good filmmaking. I can see Ford v Ferrari being dismissed as a \u201cDad Movie\u201d\u2014the kind of movie an adult child would watch with their dad over the holidays. If that is how you happen to see this picture, you and your dad are in luck.",

I found myself wishing (while I was watching it) there was a bit more footage of actual car racing in the first half of the film but I suppose thats me being a bit too lazy and hoping for 24/7 action. To be fair, the film does have some good character development and it is pretty insightful about the corporate story, even though it is a somewhat long film at just over two hours and twenty minutes long. I thought its a pretty solid film by the end - I found it quite immersive and gripping. If your a fan of motor racing or like a good biopic (especially a sports biopic) then this film is well worth seeing, yes.",
