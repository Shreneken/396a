  "summary": "A tribe of cats called the Jellicles must decide yearly which one will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new Jellicle life.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The movie, like the play, is a series of delightful songs strung together by a thin, loose thread of a plot, which lends a little credence to all the criticism and mockery online. But once you know this and have been warned by the trailer, what you’re in for is a remarkably fun time at the movies.",
    "If it’s not for everybody (I think fans of the play will like it), that’s no crime either. I appreciate the effort, got in sync (eventually) with what Hooper was trying to do and found myself quite moved, once or twice — which is twice more than “The Rise of Skywalker” managed.",
    "An individual’s appreciation of Cats may rest on a previous love of the stage play; others are more likely to throw up a hairball than purr in contentment.",
    "Does all this work? Well, it depends on how you feel about ... Cats. Did you love the show? You’ll find stuff to love here. Did you hate it? Ditto! Or maybe ... you’ll have both reactions? That’s possible too.",
    "Cats suffers from a problem common in contemporary filmed musicals. The musical doesn't trust the audience, doesn't trust that the dancing in and of itself is exciting enough to hold our interest.",
    "Cats isn’t for everyone – much of it is a cheesy, B-grade affair seemingly crafted solely to take over midnight-movie slots from “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.” Those with an open mind, though, as well as little kids and the T-Swift posse, might find it somewhat pawesome.",
    "Hayward is the very best thing about Cats, a movie that, like cats themselves, is otherwise filled with contradictions. Cats is terrible, but it’s also kind of great. And, to cat-burgle a phrase from Eliot himself, there’s nothing at all to be done about that.",
    "It’s 80-year-old Ian McKellen who can best answer that last question, having the most fun of anyone as Gus the Theater Cat, lapping out of saucers and rubbing up against corners like the true thespian he is. And really, for all its flaws, what more could you possibly ask for from Cats?",
    "In spite of its shoddy sound design (Hooper, as he did with Les Mis, has his cast sing live, but their vocals are poorly blended with the instrumentation), Cats' actors are perfectly matched to their respective roles.",
    "Cats may flop but it will be found by a likeminded audience, maybe the same one that rescued The Greatest Showman. Don’t be the sourpuss to tell these people they’re wrong.",
    "I guess I was charmed in spite of myself. I’m reminded of a quote from Alexander Pope I had to memorize as a kid, which gave me fair warning about the likes of Andrew Lloyd Webber and “Cats”: “Vice is a monster of so frightful mien / as to be hated needs but to be seen; / Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face, / We first endure, then pity, then embrace.” Did I tear up a little? Maybe. Do I ever need to see “Cats” again? Nah, I’m good.",
    "Even after 110 tumbling, tail-swishing, deeply psychedelic minutes, it’s hard to know if you ever really knew anything — except that C is for Cats, C is for Crazy, and C is probably the grade this cinematic lunacy deserves, in the sense of making any sense at all. And yet that somewhere under the Jellicle moonlight, it is somehow, too, an A++.",
    "It takes some ambitious swings and works on its own terms in fits and starts, all while not really working at all. Like the T.S. Eliot poems that inspired it, Cats is an elaborate lark.",
    "Whether you think the imagery is beautiful or nightmarish, this is a film that demands to be looked at. If nothing else, I can confirm it’s the most Jellicle experience I’ve had all year.",
    "Sadly, despite the film’s gallant efforts, I am forced to join the ranks of the naysayers. In the end, I did find that the CGI effects were as creepy as they are impressive, and there were more failed numbers than there were successful ones.",
    "Cats undermines itself in both editing and musical arrangement, barely has a plot to hang its hat on, and is CGI-ed into oblivion. Yet there’s something weirdly wonderful about just how committed Hooper is to his vision, which feels like it should have been audience-tested into something less phantasmagorical.",
    "None of this is by way of saying that Cats is bad, per se. In fact, some of the songs are pretty toe-tapping at times.",
    "It’s literally incredible. I hope I never see it again.",
    "I found “Cats” pretty bland, but it has its moments of catnip, and as a holiday movie option that anyone could see, it might be just the ticket.",
    "Its premise is ridiculous, its entire appeal based on the novelty of having a bunch of Lycra-clad strangers thrust their hips at you in the dark. Hooper creates something just as bizarre with his Cats, though not as successfully electrifying. Its flashes of brilliance feel like happy accidents and its uncanny technical choices are never overcome.",
    "Cats’ special effects render director Tom Hooper’s star-studded adaptation of the Broadway classic a lifeless disaster, though a few of its more charismatic cast members, namely Judi Dench and Idris Elba, manage to get a few licks in to add an alluring, ironic camp value.",
    "A lot of talented people have done their utmost to make Hooper’s vision succeed. Sadly, it doesn’t.",
    "The real issue is the distracting and disturbing “digital fur technology”. Every time Cats settles into an admittedly avant-garde shape, an ear twitches or a tail flicks and you’re back thinking about how ghastly the actual cats look.",
    "It’s an ugly stray who smells bad and should not be invited into your home, certainly. And yet it is its own kind of living creature, worthy of at least some basic compassion.",
    "Badly cast, broadly directed, and hampered by a book that hasn’t aged well since the musical’s 1981 West End debut, it’s hard to imagine just who this film’s target audience is.",
    "Generally, Hooper pulls away from loony-tunes excess, tries for sexy rather than freaky, and plucks at heartstrings, a reflex that pulls the story into mawkishness, particularly when he cuts to Victoria.",
    "Cats needed more narrative, more comedy, more show-stopping tunes, and more choreography that hadn’t been chopped to ribbons by the editors.",
    "There is something magical about the simple fact that this movie exists, in all its obscene, absurd wonder, its terrible filmmaking choices and bursts of jaw-dropping talent. It doesn’t need to be timely to be an artifact of its time — a movie about nothing but song and dance and, most important of all, about cats.",
    "Destined to be an instant guilty pleasure, Cats is an insane musical experiment gone wrong. It is truly like nothing cinema has ever seen. The question is, is it something cinema actually wanted?",
    "“Cats” the movie is deeply, deeply weird, and not in a good way.",
    "Cats is a slick and tedious and weird-looking exercise in self-indulgence.",
    "Cats isn't quite the unmitigated disaster that some feared -- or perversely hoped -- but it's not good, delivering a mostly incoherent adaptation of the long-running musical. An eclectic roster of stars claw out a few meager moments, but as screen experiences go, this is a memory best forgotten.",
    "Of course, Cats has always been ridiculous, just as it has always been ridiculed. (“Cats is a dog,” declared a notorious review of the musical’s Broadway debut.) But Hooper can’t even get camp right.",
    "As an adaptation, Cats is declawed, never delving fully into the possibilities offered by its proportion-manipulating trick photography and its animated cast. As a big-budget spectacle, it’s a triumphant disaster, if one at least born from a unique idea.",
    "These basic failures of taste and sensibility are a subset of Hooper’s over-all failure of literal vision: he doesn’t really see what he’s doing, and the virtual invisibility of his own movie to himself is reflected in an odd set of metaphors that result from his casting.",
    "For the most part, Cats is both a horror and an endurance test, a dispatch from some neon-drenched netherworld where the ghastly is inextricable from the tedious. Every so often it does paws — ahem, pause — to rise to the level of a self-aware hoot.",
    "Tom Hooper’s outlandishly tacky interpretation seems destined to become one of those once-in-a-blue-moon embarrassments that mars the résumés of great actors (poor Idris Elba, already scarred enough as the villainous Macavity) and trips up the careers of promising newcomers (like ballerina Francesca Hayward, whose wide-eyed, mouth-agape Victoria displays one expression for the entire movie).",
    "Here’s the thing, though: Cats still makes no f.cking sense.",
    "It's almost unfathomable that this one made it through all the preliminary production meetings without someone sensibly calling a halt to the process by saying, \"Wait a minute, those kitties are damn creepy!\"",
    "Tom Hooper’s jarring fever dream of a spectacle is like something that escaped from Dr. Moreau’s creature laboratory instead of a poet’s and a composer’s feline (uni)verse, an un-catty valley hybrid of physical and digital that unsettles and crashes way more often than it enchants.",
    "Please wipe this movie from my “Memory.”",
    "The camera’s canted angles and shaky closeups convulse with feeling that the actors can’t seem to summon. Ensemble dance sequences convey neither emotion nor information (except that the felines each have 10 fully articulated human toes). The film is rated U, but many of its uncanny images are sure to haunt viewers for generations.",
    "Mostly, Cats is a confusing litter box of intentions, from its crushed-velour aesthetic to its strip-bar sensuality to its musical cluelessness.",
    "It’s warbling warbling warbling piffle.",
    "It is the best anti-cat propaganda in the world. It could make you hate Garfield. Because the biggest sin of Cats, other than all its writhing sexuality and the heinous hairball filmmaking, is that it is supremely boring.",
    "I truly believe our divided nation can be healed and brought together as one by Cats — the musical, the movie, the disaster. In other news, my eyes are burning. Oh God, my eyes.",
    "This adaptation gets straight to the heart of the material, which is basically two hours of stray cats introducing themselves.",
    "Attention, moviegoers searching for the worst movie of the year: We have a late-breaking winner. Cats slips in right under the radar and easily scores as the bottom of the 2019 barrel — and arguably of the decade. Even Michael Bay’s trash trilogy of soul-destroying Transformers movies can’t hold a candle. What happened?",
    "The problem is not that Cats makes no sense . . . nor that the performances are mediocre (most of them are quite good). The murder weapon is the galling CGI intended to cover the actors in head-to-toe feline fur. Instead, the animation detracts from the film’s capable performers and inventive surroundings, drawing the eye reluctantly in like the sight of a person vomiting in the middle of an amusement park. It makes for a slow death, so overwhelmingly grotesque that it ceases to be interesting at all.",
    "The only realistic way to fix Cats would be to spay it, or simply pretend it never happened.  Because it's an all-time - a rare and star-spangled calamity.",
    "Is it the worst film of 2019, or simply the most recent misfire of 2019? Reader, I swear on a stack of pancakes: “Cats” cannot be beat for sheer folly and misjudgment and audience-reaction-to-“Springtime for Hitler”-in-“The Producers” stupefaction."

While yes in the beginning I did not think this thing was gonna go well, I was at the verge of tears because of how much laughter I was trying to hold back when I first saw the CGI fur. Every actor in this movie thought they were in a different movie. Jennifer Hudson/Francesca Hayward played it too seriously while Rebel Wilson/James Corden were just too comedic and light hearted. While the first two I mentioned did great, the ladder not so much. Rebel Wilson's song was so humiliating and overly sexual that I was laughing AT the film. The mice were so creepy and the roaches were revolting. James Corden did ok but his comedy was a little bit off. Idris Elba was very strong and seemed like an effective \"villain.\" Just leave on the coat Macavity. Taylor Swift had the best performance of the movie visually. Her song was dazzling and so visually pleasing. Her light British accent was nice and her voice was angelic yet strong. I just think that her and Macavity lacked chemistry, Their relationship (maybe???) should've been explored much more. Memory was so vocally amazing and JHud was a powerhouse. Francesca Hayward's Beautiful Ghosts (Taylor Swift penned) was well \"beautiful\" and helped furthered the story better than any song in the film. Overall this film was solid but character development was sparse and some of the cats were severely under used (Taylor Swift.)",

This movie is intended for fans of the musical, and not for critics and film reviewers alike who have not seen the musical, or read the poems. Yes, I’ll admit the CGI is very choppy in some areas, particularly towards the end, which is not something you want in a movie, to say the least. The controversial CGI design, however, can be easily overlooked and even ignored if you’re able to get into the story and experience of Cats. As a fan of the musical and the poems, I greatly enjoyed the film, and had a lot of fun with it. The only other criticisms I have about the film are nerdy nitpicks which I don’t want to get into (E.g: Skimbleshanks should not have a moustache!), or casting decisions that I also don’t want to get into (E.g: Rebel Wilson as Jennyanydots). Overall, the film is wonderful enjoyable if screened to the right audience, but unwise casting decisions and unfinished CGI work pull it down.

I never saw Cats when it was a musical stage sensation, but I understand that this movie stays true to its theatrical roots. TS Eliot’s work was probably not written with a theatrical adaptation in mind, so the writers have done well to spin this book of poems into a loosely knit plot. There is also a touch of Eliot’s mysticism. The characters, played by a Who’s Who of actors, convey a great deal of warmth and heart, and the production values are top notch.

Cats overflows with creativity and ardor and spirit and energy that comes from the cast onscreen and the people behind the scenes. The sets are mysteriously beautiful. But I think I was most impressed with the dancing choreographed by Andy Blankenbuehler and the dancers especially Francesca Hayward and Les Twins. But IMO all the Jellicle dancers put on an amazing show, so much so that there were moments in the film when I kind of wished director Tom Hooper had followed some of the full-cast dances a bit slower. But then again there is something to be said for Hooper's infectuous whirling effect. The singers are as good as the classic songs. Taylor Swift is a flirtatious Bombalurina who sings the nasty Macavity's (good job, Idris Elba) theme song as well as parts of \"Beautiful Ghosts\" & the full version over the end credits. . Jennifer Hudson's tortured, emotional version of \"Memory\" works wonderfully most of the time, especially at the end. This \"Cats\" casts Victoria in the starring role of an innocent homeless kitten rescued by some of the Jellicle tribe. I don't want to be a spoiler so I'll just say Victoria has some adventures as she gets to know individual Jellicles, some more than others. She follows one of Grizbella's \"Memory\" preludes with a sweet and touching version of \"Beautiful Ghosts\". If I try to comment on everyone and everything that makes Cats Cats this would be a very very long review! So just a few more. The comic relief provided by various cast members was uneven, some good, some \"meh\" but these short scenes do make Cats more entertaining and give audience members a chance to catch their collective breath. The most marvelous \"performances by an actor\" were  Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy and Ian McKellen as Gus the Theatre Cat.  There is something so warm and inviting about Dame Judi's facial expressions; she was covered with just the right amount of digital fur so that the audience could be moved by them. Sir McKellen is a treasure.He plays an old, seen-it-all actor reminicing about his long theatrical career with a sense of pride and joy in his craft that is genuinely moving. Thank you, Andrew Lloyd Webber and everyone who brought this feline magical mystery tour to the P.S. A quick comment on the \"trailers\" ~ having seen the complete movie, I feel sorry for those whose jobs were to create 3-minute trailers to communicate the merits of this movie. The film contains so much more than can be squeezed into a trailer.",

Eliot had written a book of verses regarding cats and wrote his publisher the following:\"....there might be a part that children wouldn’t like and part that adults wouldn’t like and part that nobody would like. The mise-en-scène may not please. There seem to be many more ways of going wrong than of going right    (to Geoffrey Faber, 6 March 1936)   \"Cats\", the Broadway musical, ran for 18 years and 7,485 performances opening in 1982. The previous year it opened London and now, 83 years later, it is on the silver screen. (Do people still call it that?)The first time I saw it on stage I went to the Winter Garden theatre and was interested how they changed the whole theatre into an alley and additionally  sparked my interest when you could see the 'cats' roam all over including the back of customer's seats. I didn't really pay attention to the story because there really wasn't any but watching the actors being cats was a joy of its own. It was more of an audition for some individual cats of which one would be chosen for the 'Heaviside Layer' and come back to a new life.The musical score by Andrew Lloyd Webber, using the verses of T.S.Eliot plus some help from Trevor Nunn and Richard Stilgoe, giving the world the song \"Memory\".Many people hated the show but more, specifically parents, their kids and tourists loved the show eventually making billions of dollars.The movie opened this week and will, too, have some loving it and others hating it but I think the latter will win. I don't fall into either category as I didn't feel one way or the other. Being a huge Jennifer Hudson fan I was anxious to hear/see her deliver \"Memory\" and she more than makes the song her own. Judi Dench, who was to be in the original production but who had to leave due to a Archilles tendon snapping a week before the show was to open, is here to decide who will go to the Heaviside Layer and Ian McKellen as Asaragus, Gus for short, is a once famous actor and now is old, has cerebral palsy and hopes to 'win' the chance for a new life.Various other cats are played by Idris Elba, Rebel Wilson and James Cordon while Francesca Hayward makes her film debut as Victoria a new cat abandoned by her human owners. There is also an excellent ensemble of professional dancers, many from the Royal Ballet, with choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler.The cat 'outfits' along with the disconcerting CGI effects and the direction by Tom Hopper lacks the charm of the stage productions. Though I am glad I went to see this version of \"Cats\" I won't recommend it as it is one of the many of less successful Broadway to Hollywood musicals.The movie runs an hour and 50 minutes and is rated R but I didn't hear/see anything that would be offensive for young kids who would probably get involved watched the cats.",

Despite all of the negative reviews, it is pretty true to the stage production with some slight changes. Francesca Hayward was an enchanting Victoria, Dame Judi Dench was charming, and the CGI really wasn’t the disaster critics claim. Cats has always been a whimsical, idiosyncratic musical without a hefty plot line. The joy of Cats is in the wonderful music, dancing, and the unique feline characters. If you have no sense of fun or appreciation for the arts and can’t suspend your disbelief long enough to simply enjoy some great singers and actors who happen to be in Cat costumes, skip this film. I’m sure there will be another dull, formulaic and unoriginal film you can watch instead. Maybe another Fast and Furious sequel is more your speed ?!?!",

Do the you think the humans pretending to be magical singing cats look weird? I tell you, if someone was going to make an adaptation of ALW's Cats, i WANTED it to look weird! I wanted it to strange, fantastical, sometimes silly, sometimes oddly serious, and always unlike any other movie out there. In those terms, this film is a wild success. You can argue that you don't like the show on which it is based (I had actually never seen it, nor was I familiar with most of the music,) and that you might have never had any interest in seeing any adaptation of it period, but I feel like most people are merely reviewing the film's existence and not the film itself. If you don't like the look of the film and the performers, what WOULD have satisfied you? It was always going to be humans pretending to be cats. Yes, the CGI fur and make-up looks odd, but I was totally fine with it. I was thoroughly entertained for the entire film. I went to an early press screening, and then took my wife a few days later. Unlike me, she is very familiar with the show and she absolutely loved this film. Even more than I. Are there so rough edges to this film? Definitely. But that's certainly true with similarly toned recent musicals like Moulin Rouge or The Greatest Showman, and I like this film considerably more than those. The cast here is excellent. Ian McKellen is a notable standout. Many of the non-star dancers are exceptional. I think Hooper did an excellent job with the film. A Cats movie was always going to be weird. This is gloriously weird. The more people who hate on it now, the bigger the cult status it will achieve later. This film has its fans. They just need to find each other. This one will be watched for years to come. Just not by everyone.",

This is such a wildly imaginative movie in both story and appearance.In order to help explain the plot, it helps to look at this film's origins. At first, there were a bunch of poems about cats written by T.S. Elliott in the 1930s. Then came the crazy idea to turn them into songs for an eighties musical. It really didn't have any spoken words. A loose story was added to tie the songs together. Now we've got a film trying to to sell this loose concept to a general audience. I don't think it did too bad a job.The movie takes the basic musical and adds some dialogue and a little more to flesh things out. The story is this: a bunch of cats compete in order to win the honor of cat reincarnation. The story still isn't big; a lot of this is just the contestants introducing themselves through song. (You can go through multiple numbers without dialogue.) Still, I feel it works well enough. Don't get me wrong, the whole thing is kind of nuts. We've got a whole bunch of humanoid felines doing a bunch of random stuff. (Also, some of them are magic apparently.) But that's what I like about this. It's basically creative pageantry that is just trying to have fun. (Although, there is this really dark turn in the Jenny Anydots song, which wasn't in the previous works. It left a bad taste.)Director Tom Hooper really tried to keep the highlights of the musical: the songs and the dancing. A lot of musical movie adaptations have to cut stuff for time, but this one is surprisingly intact. The movie manages to keep all but one song I believe. Fans of the original be prepared that they change up the lyrics or musical tempo or style for some of the numbers. (I think the movie was trying to update these to appeal to the mainstream.) Personally, I didn't find any of the changes too outrageous.As for the songs, well Memory, which the musical is best known for, is an excellent piece. The other numbers, though... Well, these contain thirties lyrics and peculiar feel to a lot of them. I think the songs are decent, but they don't compete with a bunch of other musicals. They're a bit of a selective taste. The new song Beautiful Ghosts (the one they usually create for films in order to get a best original song Oscar nomination) is okay. The lyrics are very poetic, but the music can't live up to them.One of the things I like best about this is that it brings back what is missing in a lot of modern musicals: the extended dance sections. The choreography is really good the cinematography does a fluid job of displaying the action. There is a real distinctiveness to people dancing like cats.This movie is eye-candy personified. All the sets are huge, dreamlike, and colorful in a dark neon sort of way (as confusing as that sounds.) There are these big fantastic-looking set pieces and so many of them.The cats are created using computer graphics on mo-cap actors. The people-cats are definitely distinctive looking. The animation for the faces never quite feel natural, but it I didn't find it to be a deal breaker either.For a movie where people act like cats, I'm impressed that almost the entire cast really committed to this. Idris Elba seems to be having a hell of a time eating up the scenery. It's rather fascinating seeing how veteran actors Judi Dench and Ian McKellan take such goofy actions as rubbing heads together or scratching themselves so seriously. McKellan puts so much work into his character's mannerisms that I think this is one of his best roles. The lead Francesca Haywood, a ballerina, does a fine job as the newbie to the group.Remember when I said \"almost?\" Well, Rebel Wilson as Jennyanydots is the only actor who doesn't feel like they're trying to play a character. She's just doing Rebel Wilson stuff and throwing jokes. The character Jennyanydots as she plays her doesn't really match the character as described in her introductory song.This movie, especially the songs may not be for everyone. It's kinda artsy, but I found this to be a truly unique and creative ride. I say give it a shot.",

Maybe you're thinking after two hours you'll get used to the ghouls, because you'll get immersed in the plot or something. But nope, they're still ghouls the whole time and it's always terrifying.  And there is no plot.This was the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time, mostly because the combination of unintentionally terrifying creatures really sincerely trying their best to be cute for so long but just never succeeding was sort of like a running gag that kept getting funnier and funnier as time wore on.Also when you add on top of the cutesy terror the fact that there also attempts at humor that never quite land, so its sort of like if a demon was doing a standup set and just bombing up there and you feel bad for him but well, he is still a demon who would devour your soul at the first chance so not too bad for him.And then you add in that none of the songs make any god damn sense whatsoever because there is no plot development so stuff just sort of happens and it is terrifying and then it stops.This is a trash classic.",

The movie starts with a horror vibe as the main cat is ambushed by a bunch of cats wanting food for the night. After a few songs about genitals we get to the main plot of the story.The queen cat has to pick a cat to kill and send to space. so we go on this whole wacky adventure with hit star James Cordon and other non important characters and jump into the world of cats. They eat,drink and meow like cats. Half-way through seeing the movie i realized it was not star wars, but in fact cats. I mean most people were probably confused, it had Dumbledore. anyways back to the movie. talor swift drugs all the cats and then the sung a song about wanting to bring back all the cats that were thanos snapped (James Cordon). Once they are back the queen cat picks a black cat because she is racist. then the cat dies and they sing a song about being cats. all in all i give this movie a 10/10.",

I’ve been a fan of the original cats musical for a while now, so watching the movie from the stance of a theatre fan, this movie did an amazing job at bringing the magic of cats to the big screen. First of all, I love what they did with Victoria’s character. In the original musical Victoria doesn’t have a song and she isn’t the main character, no one is. But they way they spun this film into a story of a abandonment and acceptance was really touching. Furthermore the scene with skimbleshanks was incredible and magical. I could not believe how they gave skimble an entire tap number which fit his character perfectly. And Jennifer Hudson’s performance of “Memory” had me in tears in the theatre. Overall, this film was a great adaptation from musical to movie. Anyone who dislikes this movie is most likely a hater of the original breathtaking musical, Cats.",

For the most part the film hits the spot. It has most of the songs from the original musical. The new song, Beautiful Ghosts, isn't a great fit but neither is it terrible. It's great to see some a variety of actors in the roles, which are pretty much a good fit. I don't have an issue with the CG, other than from a technical standpoint the fur seems to shift ever so slightly at times in relation to the actor. The story from the original musical is an odd one, and I suspect most people didn't understand it or pay attention, watching the dancing and listening to the songs instead. The film explains a lot more about what's going on, and it's either something you engage with or think is daft. Overall I enjoyed it, but clear it's proving divisive.",

This movie will give them a near experience to what it’s like to watch the show on Broadway. My sister who hates the live show adored this movie. She said it made the entire stage plot make sense.
