  "title": "Avengers: Endgame",
  "rating": 7.9,
  "release_date": "2019-04-26",
  "summary": "The grave course of events set in motion by Thanos that wiped out half the universe and fractured the Avengers ranks compels the remaining Avengers to take one final stand in Marvel Studios’ grand conclusion to twenty-two films.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "In a word, it’s terrific.",
    "If “Infinity War” was about failure, “Endgame” is, ironically, all about acceptance and moving on. After 11 long years, the Infinity Saga is finally, fulfillingly over. There is no post-credit scene. But oh, what a going-away party these old friends have thrown for themselves.",
    "A victory lap that moonwalks through the best part of the MCU back catalogue and emphasises emotion as much as action, this is an intensely satisfying piece of blockbuster filmmaking.",
    "I’m not prepared to instantly label Avengers: Endgame as the best of the 23 Marvel Universe movies to date, but it’s a serious contender for the crown and it’s the undisputed champion when it comes to emotional punch.",
    "I have to admit, in all its surreal grandiosity, in all its delirious absurdity, there is a huge sugar rush of excitement to this mighty finale, finally interchanging with euphoric emotion and allowing us to say poignant farewells.",
    "Marvel has clearly saved the best for last and I cannot stress how much those fan service moments will have you cheering. I highly recommend that you see Endgame in a packed theater of fans so that you can experience the climactic ending with the energy of the crowd.",
    "Avengers: Endgame is easily the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s most ambitious, emotional, and affecting film to date, somehow managing to tie up more than a decade of storytelling in a confident (and mostly coherent) climax - a hurdle that many other blockbuster franchises have stumbled over in their final runs.",
    "Comic book fans know the thrill of following all your favorite characters through a multi-issue storyline that culminates in a “universe at stake” ending. Now, thanks to 21 movies in 11 years and one massive, satisfying three-hour finale, moviegoers do, too.",
    "Even with the interlocking nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Endgame feels like a triumph of narrative engineering -- weaving in enough callbacks to earlier movies to delight even the nerdiest patrons.",
    "Succeeds at its daunting task: summing up an epic struggle with bedazzling action; with a style that progresses, apart from a few lapses, from the elegiac through the episodic to the symphonic; and with more humor, zest and feeling — the real, heartfelt stuff — than you’d dare to expect from what is, after all, an immense industrial undertaking.",
    "There’s a host of great performances too, from Evans’s sad and weary nonagenarianism to Johansson’s watery mettle to Brolin’s lumbering and alluring villainy.",
    "The most shocking thing about Avengers: Endgame is that there are several moments within this colossal movie that feel like a Marvel miracle. These are the pockets of time when what you watch on screen sends a shock of joy jumping through your skin, making your eyes go wide and watery at the spectacle.",
    "What's best about Markus and McFeely's script is that they understand the characters.",
    "It is so uncannily adroit at balancing humor and pathos that the two complement rather than detract from each other.",
    "Endgame provides something truly satisfying: a sense of closure.",
    "Oh yes indeed. Avengers: Endgame brought it...This film had an insanely difficult job to do — to gracefully and tidily wrap up a 22-movie Marvel Comics cycle with a cast list bigger than the Hulk, and to do so with both poignancy and hold-your-breath action — and it delivers.",
    "If the Marvel superhero movies on the whole are your favorite band’s individual albums, Avengers: Endgame is the triple-disc greatest-hits package with the really awesome cover and a slew of familiar, comforting gems inside.",
    "The film earns its length not by overstuffing the frame with opulent action, but by slowing things down and basking in the charisma of its ensemble.",
    "Endgame was never designed to stand on its own as a single well-crafted movie, and it was never designed to follow the MCU formula. It was designed to cap a decade of buildup around a single gigantic story.... In that sense, it’s certainly a triumph: it’s ambitious, towering, and above all, daring in its difference.",
    "Endgame manages to effectively deliver reunions alongside farewells, fan service alongside the kind of storytelling which needs to occur in order for the whole billion-dollar machine to keep a’grinding, and a handful of sincere, honest-to-God surprises that make the grandeur of the whole thing feel justified.",
    "And to say that directors Joe and Anthony Russo fulfilled the promise set by last year’s blockbuster, and the 22-film MCU story arc, is a gross understatement. The directing duo has really outdone themselves with this one. It’s just that outdoing themselves comes with some consequences.",
    "The movie largely delivers, splashing its ambitious three-hour narrative across a sprawling canvas of characters, eras, and not-quite-insurmountable challenges.",
    "The final battle is giddily cathartic, but the catharsis arises from prioritising character development over plot and spectacle. This, I imagine, will be the Avengers’ legacy.",
    "This is fan service elevated into an art form, transcending winking self-aggrandisement to become something of a reflection on the past eleven years, a chugging, tooting, spectacular train of a franchise, careering indefinitely forward.",
    "Avengers: Endgame throws in plenty of laughs along the way. In fact, in the long stretch between its appropriately somber opening chapter and an emotionally grueling finale, it may be the most lighthearted and character-driven Marvel movie since the giddy comic entry \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" Endgame consists almost entirely of the downtime scenes that were always secretly everyone’s favorite parts of these movies anyway.",
    "Avengers: Endgame isn’t a great movie, but there are flashes of greatness in it, and quite a few of them belong to Evans. His Captain America rewards us with a revelation and escapes with a secret. The best thing in Avengers: Endgame is everything he doesn’t say.",
    "The movie hits you like a shot in the heart.",
    "Endgame often pays tribute to itself, which makes it as fascinating as it is self-serious. It taps into a live wire of doomy tragedy and phoenix-like rebirth that comics do so well.",
    "An alternative title for this one might have been Avengers: Encore, since the film knows its entire audience has been here for the long run – even beside Infinity War, Endgame would be completely impenetrable to a novice. Think of it as a kind of victory lap, in which a decade-plus of painstaking team assembly is re-run at top speed, then paid off with thermonuclear dazzle and force.",
    "Avengers: Endgame is, without a doubt, the most confusing and convoluted of any of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, yet it’s also unbelievably satisfying – and, yes, does act as an endpoint for many major character arcs.",
    "Not quite as good as Infinity War, but wears its three-hour running time with ease and rewards the fans. Part of the journey is the end, and this goes out with a bang that’ll make you whimper.",
    "No matter what comes next from Marvel Studios, this Avengers is a gargantuan love letter to the equally enormous mythology that Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and the rest of their collaborators built — and to the generations of readers and moviegoers who truly believe in it.",
    "Best of all is Robert Downey Jr. Amid all the hardware, he alone in the Marvel series has consistently given top-notch performances. His work in “Endgame” is extraordinarily moving and makes me wish yet again that this great actor would on occasion see fit to be great in a movie that doesn’t require him to fill out a franchise.",
    "Avengers: Endgame isn’t as brash, surprising, or relentless as its predecessor but it’s a worthy conclusion to the Infinity War duology and provides a satisfying end to the First Avengers Era.",
    "The movie is ludicrously long, clocking in at three hours and one minute, but surprisingly satisfying.",
    "It’s really like nothing that Hollywood has produced before, existing not just to acknowledge or exploit the fans of this series, but to reward their love, patience, and undying adoration.",
    "If you partake of the Marvel universe, this movie is for you no matter what. And if you don’t, seeing it would be like going to church if you’re an atheist — an experience of spectacle unmoored from any purpose or definition. In the case of “Endgame,” we’re talking fine spectacle, to be sure, the best that money can buy.\r\nBut all the same, this one is strictly for the faithful.",
    "Generous in humor, spirit and sentimentality, Anthony and Joe Russo's Endgame is a surprisingly full feast of blockbuster-making that, through some time-traveling magic, looks back nostalgically at Marvel's decade of world domination. This is the Marvel machine working at high gear, in full control of its myth-making powers and uncovering more emotion in its fictional cosmos than ever before.",
    "I wasn’t sure, after the tedium of Infinity War, that Marvel could wrap this up in a satisfying way. Turns out, it was a snap.",
    "It’s as sprawling and pulse-pounding a fight as you’re hoping it will be.",
    "It’s the time travel conceit that keeps “Endgame” hopping, and the trial-and-error sequences recall some of the best parts of the first “Iron Man” 11 years back.",
    "Avengers: Endgame has almost nothing on its mind but crossing the Ts and dotting the Is of a far-flung superhero saga, but to anyone with even a minor emotional stake in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it has all the fleeting satisfaction of a shot of whipped cream delivered directly from the spray can.",
    "Endgame is the superhero equivalent to an original cast revival in a long-running Broadway show, and often has the same hair-raising effect.",
    "Even at three-plus hours, the gargantuan Avengers: Endgame is light on its feet and more freely inventive than it needed to be. Given the year-long wait, its audience — Pavlovian dogs, myself (woof!) included — would have salivated over less. It’s better than Avengers: Infinity War, which was better than Avengers: Age of Ultron; and it is, for a change, conclusive.",
    "Not every emotional beat lands, and some action scenes merely repeat past strengths. But between Brolin’s continued excellence as Thanos, a moral monster who believes in the righteousness of his cause, and the filmmakers’ effortless popcorn-movie poetry, Endgame is a muscular send-off to this series of comic-book extravaganzas.",
    "The inside jokes and fan-service digressions are blatant and relentless, but also pretty effective. The conflicting narrative priorities that often bedevil an epic series finale — how to tell a story that builds with inexorable momentum while also staging the mother of all cast reunions? — are cleverly and resourcefully reconciled.",
    "Settling scores, wrapping up loose ends and taking a victory lap — the main objects of the game this ostensibly last time around — generate some comic sparks as well as a few honest tears.",
    "After nearly two and a half hours of hardcore comicbook entertainment — alternating earnest storytelling with self-deprecating zingers designed to show that Marvel doesn’t take itself too seriously — “Endgame” wraps all that logic-bending nonsense with a series of powerful emotional scenes.",
    "While constantly eventful and a feast for the eyes, it's also notably more somber than its predecessors. But just when it might seem about to become too grim, Robert Downey Jr. rides to the rescue with an inspired serio-comic performance that reminds you how good he can be.",
    "This insane stable of A-list actors finally got to show their chops. Downey Jr. gives some of his best work during act one with Johansson, Renner, and Evans coming a close second to matching his pain as they try to lick their wounds.",
    "An earnest, overstuffed, fitfully funny superhero melodrama, Endgame hits the buttons it wants to hit, and sometimes affectingly.",
    "As Endgame sputters to the finish line, it leaves the impression of witnessing a Marvel Movie Marathon compressed to three hours — and 58 seconds, but trust me, they’re disposable — of unbridled fan service.",
    "Avengers: Endgame is nothing if not the crowd-pleasingest crowd-pleaser in recent cinema history...Give everybody, and I do mean EVERYbody, a curtain call.",
    "For fans, counting up how many superheroes can emerge from the clown car of one three-hour movie is half the fun. For casual moviegoers — say, those who might skip minor installments such as “Ant-Man and the Wasp” — it accounts for half the exhaustion, a bit of world-building fatigue to go along with the sensory overload of a fantasy realm that seems stuck in perpetual apocalypse.",
    "The one thing you do need to know about Avengers: Endgame is that it runs for a little over three hours, and that you can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax. You won’t have missed a thing.",
    "Even if I could muster the strength to defy studio marching orders on plot details, there is no point. There is little in Endgame that is worth spoiling, given how its core is spoiled rotten to begin with.",
    "Every serious narrative beat in the film is ultimately undercut by pro-forma storytelling, or by faux-improvised humor."

The minor characters orGo ahead and watch the trailers for Avengers: Endgame, they won't give anything major away. It's amazing for a huge movie to be so self-aware of itself, as well as, the movie genres that they're overtly borrowing from. The minor characters or those not even in Avengers: Infinity War, step up and help set up huge sequences that are highly entertaining and actually answer questions. Avengers: Endgame acknowledges every aspect of the characters emotions in their previous MCU film's and succeeds in the most Meta way possible.Ant-Man is a major reason for this. It's no spoiler to say that he's in the film as he produces some of the biggest laughs from the trailer of him ringing the bell at the Avenger's front gate. It's Paul Rudd's wry jokes, quick timing and fish out of water facial expressions that really assist things.The pacing of Avengers: Endgame is amazing and not for the reasons you might think. It's brilliantly paced, but it throws the entire formula and how MCU films are done on their head. Battle, loss, battle, loss, humor and then victory, take those ingredients, shake well and you've got a loose description of some average superhero films.If Avengers: Infinity War left you feeling betrayed and bummed out, I feel you. Avengers: Endgame more than makes up for any ill feelings that it caused. I see why they played it the way they did, and doing so any other way would've cheapened the film, watered down the MCU and made it all disposable. It is also worth noting that the film balance lots of humor with the drama, all the while putting it in a nice bow with stones.What we're left with is a 10 year opus that spans more arcs than Lord of the Rings and encapsulates it all in a perfect manner. Granted, they will still make many MCU films, this is not their swan song. However, there is a victory lap feeling about Avengers: Endgame. It respects the fans, adds to the dramatic elements, answers questions that fans have wondered about and plants a couple new seeds to grow on.",

Also, if Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye, Star Lord, Black Panther and Dr. Strange are fighting together in one scene, I don't think people would say it's \"forced\" although they are all males. Last but not least, this whole movie is a fan service. Let's just celebrate the diversity of the superhero lineup. Everyone of them is the favorite for some fans.

This movie is best benefited by those who have watched most of, if not all of the Marvel films. Throwbacks and characters appear from more than last decade of movies. The acting and comedy is on point with every joke hitting perfectly and every actor showing their passion for the role. The movies set pieces are perfect with sets from past movies. The action, humor and overall story telling shows the passion that not only the Russo brothers had for this film but everyone involved. The story concludes the 22 films perfectly while also leaving character arcs open for future MCU movies. This movie deserves the praise and excites me for future MCU movies in the future. This movie is a roller coaster which can be benefited most by those who have seen many of the other marvel films. Thank you to all those involved in the production of this movie, you have created a great films!",

After the shocking cliffhanger in last year’s, “Infinity War”, the long year wait moved fast and slow all at the sameThe time has come. The thrilling conclusion to the Infinity Stones saga and the Marvel Cinematic Universe as we know it. After the shocking cliffhanger in last year’s, “Infinity War”, the long year wait moved fast and slow all at the same time. Now that we are here, the questions began to flow in. Who lives? Who dies? What happens to the world? All of these questions and more are answered but not in the way you might think or in the most understandable way. The film opens up with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) free-floating in space on the Guardians spacecraft with Nebula (Karen Gillian) after the snap from Thanos (Josh Brolin) and losing Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), and Drax (Batista) on Thanos home planet, Titan. Some humor is added to the mix with both Tony and Nebula playing a game of paper football while waiting for life support to fail. This leads to a monologue with Tony recording a message to Pepper (Gywneth Paltrow) through his helmet. After that, it looks like he is close to death. But, a orange glow overtakes the ship and it’s Captain Marvel (Brie Larson)  to the rescue. From there, they are reunited with the team that remains. Fast forward a bit and now they find Thanos, thanks to Nebula. The stones have been destroyed and Thor beheads him. What do our heroes do? Five years later and still no results. The movie petals along for a good solid hour with our heroes trying to find different theories until they realize that time travel is the only option. The first hour of this film does tend to move a bit slower then you traditional Marvel film. We are treated to a very depressing and somber tone with giving each character their moment and what they have been doing over the last five years. The biggest moment by-far is given to Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Beer and time have not been kind to him. Yes that’s what I said, beer. I don’t want to give it away but his appearance generated some of the theater’s funniest laughs. I was glad in this sequence to see a few characters from “Thor: Ragnorak” make a return appearance and see that they are alright. I was really surprised how many laughs were in this film considering where the story is at this time. I think there may have been almost too much funny going on here at times but that may have been just because of the audience that was with me in the theater. Petaling along, we are treated to all of the avengers splitting off into different times to locate all of the stones before Thanos gets them. These were some great sequences and it was great to see some old familiar people from past Marvel films and callbacks to the first avengers film. Time travel is a key part for the whole last two hours of this film and while things to make sense at times, there are also many different plot holes I found too. Some time travel events don’t exactly match up with previous time rules we have seen in other films or what common sense would tell you in these situations. It leads to some convoluted and messy things that still are a bit bothersome especially when five years have passed and at the end of the film, Peter Parker goes back to high school and sees his friend,  Ned (Jacob Batalon). How did high school resume for them when five years have passed? I am hoping this is answered in the upcoming “Spider-Man: Far From Home”. The final battle of this film is quite the epic spectacle. Not as big as some of the reviews were hinting because I still believe in the big picture of things that the battles in the previous film were a bit better. Although the moment where all of the avengers assemble here is quite the goosebumps moment. The CGI is nearly flawless in the film with only some moments in the final battle looking a little too green screen. There are a couple of deaths in the film. One of them I was expecting and another not so much. I won’t tell you here but the one I was expecting gets a proper sendoff and it is a good farewell that feels right. I am also pleased that Captain America gets the ending that I always wanted. It’s exactly what I predicted and if you listen to mine and Jason Kobasic’s podcast on the previous film and our first part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe recap, you will know what I mean. This film bookends just about every thread from the previous 21 Marvel films. It couldn’t have been an easy task for the filmmakers to put that together and create something special. They did and everything comes together real nice in the final moments and I loved the final shot. It  put a smile on my face and felt very satisfied. I still like “Infinity War” a tad bit better then this one but this is still a great addition and an epic conclusion to these first three phases. Bravo Marvel and we will see you in Phase four and beyond. Grade: B+",

Sometimes a bit slow, sometimes a bit tóó much comic relief, and some weird decisions regardingAvengers: Endgame is, and I'm not overselling this, a wonderfully crafted film that truly ends one of the best organised franchises ever. Sometimes a bit slow, sometimes a bit tóó much comic relief, and some weird decisions regarding character development, but somehow, it all works, like pieces finally fitting in a magnificent (not at all perfect, but magnificent) puzzle. The two first acts are steady and are greatly dedicated to the core characters, as the third act focuses on the ultimate fight, crafting one of the most epic shots I have ever seen in movie history, and by far my favorite shot from the entire MCU. Regarding the title, Endgame truly feels like an end, and as a rather perfect one for that matter (certainly if you're an MCU fan -- in which case you will experience what is probably the most satisfying ending of a film ever), wrapping up the entire Infinity Saga with some emotional but primarily satisfying and in a way beautiful (dare I say perfect) ending. The screenplay goes through a rough patch due to its complex story, but still manages to deliver a cohesive film. As acting performances are concerned, Downey and Evans again do whatever it takes to pull off the portryal of their legendary characters, but it is Jeremy Renner and Chris Hemsworth who are really performing like their lives depend on it. Ruffalo looks like he had the best time ever shooting this flick, while performances of Johansson and Brolin are steady as ever. As I previously stated, the ending is perfect. There is absolutely no way anyone can guess how the story goes, as Marvel is trying to be as inventive as they can. I am extremely satisfied with Avengers: Endgame, a culmination film that exceeds expectations (that were already pretty high) and that does everything it can to be as spectacular, jaw-dropping and bombastic as possible. Again, satisfying is the word. And epic. And complex. But mostly satisfying and epic.",

From the beginning we get to feel what the characters feel. There is a sense when initially seeing Thanos that he is perhaps somewhat weaker yet this could be the same for the Avengers too. The film unfolds with a downbeat atmosphere then builds and builds. It is filled with emotion, surprises, laughter (Thor especially!) and of course fight. The battle at the end is brilliant and the emergence of the portals letting in Black Panther et al...just wow! All characters have a weakness which is exposed with feeling by the Russo brothers. It makes our heroes gain a sense of the humanistic. They end the saga with integrity and a sense of warmth towards them. The end possibly sets it up for new heroes. If you stay til the end, the metal clanging could be reference to the rebuild of a new iron man? whatever happens next my son and I will be a part of it all. Bring on the next chapter",

All the actors in this film did amazing jobs. From when we first see them to now you can see the character growth that has developed in them. This film is three-hours-and-two-minutes long but really you never feel it. You’re so engaged in this movie and the characters that the time just flies by so quickly and every second in this film is important. I feel like if they got rid of anything in this film it would take away from something. That something being the emotion in this film.

And I am glad that they did that. You cannot overwrite something. You cannot destroy the existence of something by overwriting its state and thus also not overwrite the event that served as initiation of the overwrite itself.That was perfect.What was not perfect? Well, first of all, they used Multiverse Theory. That is bad, because it is also inconsistent but whatever - let's accept that, it fits the comics overall and is at least no Consistency Paradox. BUT the story tries to establish \"if we bring the stones back we dry out those time branches\" - what? No. Either they exist or they don't. Trying to \"dry them out\" would mean you would actually depend on the Overwrite Consistency Paradox which the writers so skillfully already cancelled out. Now IF they establish \"the stones were always brought back, we do not overwrite a timeline/delete it, we simply are talking about something that is possibly but never comes into existence\" then okay, then it would mean that within a timeloop they always brought back the stones after getting them. But they very well established that they want to get rid of the timelines so they were no talking about timelines that never existed in the first place. A timeline without a Thanos because Past Thanos travelled to the other branch will always exist. A timeline where Loki stole the Tesseract and fled will always exist and there is nothing they can do about it by bringing back the stones. At best they \"always brought back the stones\" and that's it. The timelines that we know definitely exist even if there might have never been a timeline \"without Infinity Stones\".Now this being said, I am glad that they at least tried and of course its fine that they at least tried to make an effort caring about causality but treating it like there are no other timelines now is just nonsense because from a chronological perspective and the establishment \"we cannot overwrite/delete things\" they very clearly (and realistically) could not do anything about that. The timeloop by the way was also sloppy because Cap cannot bring back the stones in their original state so he definitly \"has not always brought them back to his own timeline\". I do not know if they forgot about that but I can turn a blind eye on that because they really tried other than other movies and Tony's fate was heartbreaking but he got a solid sendoff, so did Captain America. It is great how the movie ended with him giving him \"a second chance\", but I think the writers wanted us to just think about the joyful side of this because the reality is: Even that was another timeline. Captain America had a life with an Alterative Magaret. His own Margaret still became an old, lonely lady in his \"home timeline\" and that is pretty sad and depressing for both.Well, nevertheless for what the movie tried, establishing good character scenes with all kinds of emotions, wrapping up things (even if not completely correct but the effort was here) and offering spectacular finale to this story arc it did a absolutey fantastic job.By the way - there was no solid reason why they could not snap their own set of Stones back into existence. On top of that: i understand why they cannot bring back Gamora and Natasha as they ARE the Soul Stone but Vision existed together with the Mind Stone and Thanos already proved the Stone together with Vision can be brought back so they should have brought him back.I love it times 3000. By the way - half of the time travelling complaints here on this site come from ordinary pop-culture fanboys that have no idea of time phenomena, causality, et cetera. Just as the other half is from Thanos fanboys that really thought Thanos was a hero in Infinity War just because he \"wanted something good for 50%\" completely dismissing the psychopathic part of the character.",

But, was it really so perfectly great? No. ..Good : The first thing I loved about this movie was that it was the most character driven film in the MCU till date. In particular, Hawkeye and Black Widow got the most of character shine. And, it didn't have much of Captain Marvel. As someone who feels awkward when she comes on screen, it was a good thing. It did a great job of serving the fans. So many crowd pleasing moments! I was literally jumping and whistling when I was watching this film, literally. The third act is full of those moments. Those moments do come along with really good character background, a story and excitement. All of these do not make complete sense, but at least they weren't blant. And, many parts are quite nostalgic. It has tried its best to give every character a proper arc. Performances are incredible. I didn't even hate Don Cheadle in this movie. On the whole, it was insanely entertaining and has ridiculous amount of great moments to say the least. ..Mixed : It's not a spoiler to say it's a time travel film. While this plot device served a lot to give us a lot of crowd pleasing moments, each of which I really loved, the whole time travel part could've been even more epic and exciting than it was. There were parts in Infinity War where it jumped from plotline to plotline. This one does the same, but it looked more choppy here. Not necessarily a bad thing, a movie of this scale would have such problems. But it was a bit more distracting than before. I admit I liked many arcs given to the characters. But, they were still a bit illogical, in particular that of Steve Rogers. Many things were entertaining as hell, but still quite paradoxical. ..Bad : It's a time travel movie. It generates a lot many plot holes and inconsistencies. It uses time travel as an excuse for getting certain things done. It has the most generic issues of a non sci-fi time travel movie. The timeline surely is f**ked up now. I don't know how the time travel in this universe works and how certain things were amended due to all of these time travelling stuffs. May be I will never know. And Thanos. He was treated more like a mustache twirling villain, rather than how he was in Infinity War. The way his character ended was the most disappointing part of the movie. It feels as if it tries to be as big as Infinity War while it clearly isn't. ..Conclusion : You can and must watch this film. It's a film by the Russo Brothers, you can definitely count on them for an entertaining film, but this is perhaps their weakest film in the MCU. It isn't well paced as Infinity War is, but still gives all the moments you can wish for. Infinity War is a whole lot better than this film, but is still a worth watching flick. If you stop thinking about the inconsistencies time travel creates in this film, this will be a much better experience. ..Rating. ..Score : 8.9/10Grade : A",

The time travel part creates a huge amount of plotholes, but it's interesting indeed.The movie lends too much time for the first part, filling much of the 3 hours of the movie. The main characters on this movie are the original avengers, whose story ends in this movie. The best part about this movie is how it ties up all the storylines of the MCU in a satisfying conclusion.It is a worse movie than Infinity War but it definitely isn't a disappointment. However it gives me the idea that the future of the MCU won't be that great, seeing as the most important Avengers in the next phase are mostly absent (I still don't see Captain Marvel as the leader of the New Avengers, it is still an undeveloped character).Hawkeye/Ronin's storyline is compelling and Scarlett Johansson works the best as Black Widow in this movie, although her sacrifice scene is a bit odd.The final battle against Thanos is compelling although being time travel Thanos makes it less dramatic. The battle between Thanos and Scarlet Witch could have been more emotional with a Thanos that killed Vision.Tony Stark's sacrifice is compelling as the end of Stark's character development, becoming a symbol for the hope of humanity and the Avengers.
