    "summary": "Following a mysterious treasure map into a spectacular underground realm of twisting passages, outrageous booby-traps and a long-lost pirate ship full of golden dubloons, the kids race to stay one step ahead of a family of bumbling bad guys... and a mild-mannered monster with a face only a mother could love. [Warner Bros.]",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "The Goonies has a rich and indomitable air of all-American innocence.",
        "A rolicking good time is had by all in this adventure that is built on archetypal plot strands that tie together oh so well.",
        "It has crooks, bats, cobwebs, skeletons, a lovable monster, an underground grotto and a treasure hidden by some of the most considerate, clue-loving pirates who ever lived. Their ghostly ship is the movie's piece de resistance.",
        "The Goonies, like Gremlins, shows that Spielberg and his directors are absolute masters of how to excite and involve an audience. \"E.T.\" was more like \"Close Encounters\"; it didn't simply want us to feel, but also to wonder, and to dream.",
        "The action at the center of Chris Columbus' script occasionally falters and generally feels manufactured, but the kids go about their chores as if convinced that all their make-believe is true.",
        "Though obviously aimed at a younger audience, The Goonies is packed with four-letter words. Sure kids speak like that, but writer Chris Columbus and director Richard Donner rely on obscenities as a substitution for clever punch lines, tossing in a few sex jokes and a touch of racist humor as well.",
        "Territory is typical small town Steven Spielberg; this time set in a coastal community in Oregon. Story is told from the kids' point-of-view and takes a rather long time to be set in motion.",
        "The usual Spielberg rhetoric about the sanctity of childhood and the beauty of dreams seems wholly factitious in this crass context, which even includes a commercial--in the form of a rock video--for the tie-in merchandise."

We have familiar faces in Josh Brolin and Sam Astin in their much younger days, the latter playing young Mikey, a kid with breathing problems who talks fast and seems to be the level headed one of the bunch, until he begins to start chasing treasure in the hope finding something to save his town, which is about to be demolished. His older brother Brand, played by Brolin, loves his brother but doesn't agree with his childish adventures, but Mikey and his friends manage to embark on their adventure in a very accidental way, unearthing secrets they never imagined before. A series of traps and willpower test these young explorers as they dig deeper into centuries old secrets. The standout of his friends is the larger than life Chunk, probably named for his larger size, but Jeff Cohen delivers a hilarious and energetic performance as this talkative, annoying and always hungry character, he brings a wonderful sense if playfulness and young shenanigans to the film, something that's missing from the \"kid-friendly\" films of today, but it isn't all innocent. There are different themes throughout the film, that border between adventure and even horror, Steven Spielberg has created a piece that entices the viewer but is really there to enjoy, I suppose it comes down to trying to recapture youth in the most exhilarating of ways, the kids are chased by the notorious Fratellis, a family of criminals who happen upon the same plan, this provides another dose of comic value, it's also interesting that it brings back the nostalgic notion that every character within a group in a film has some sort of use, the one who is afraid, the strong one, smart one, techie one and the stud, it's a nice touch that doesn't really happen anymore and gives a real sense of purpose and reason to be there.\rThis is a true adventure and has the Spielberg effect of epic touch and a perfect score, the performances of the young cast are exceptional, letting their imaginations run wild and having one last blowout before the next stage in their life, they are foul-mouthed and mischievous, they are children.",

Then there is the matter of the acting, some characters where portraied very nicely, like Chuck, he was very entertaining, but other characters, like Data, where hard to watch, understand, or relate too. I had to relay on what the other characters said to get what he was saying. And finally the pacing of the movie, particularly at the end, the characters felt rushed into certain situations to advance the plot, and with the lack of any clue to as what is going on until 3/4ths the way through the movie really hurts to what could have been one of my favorite movies.

The story starts when the Goon Docks area of the town of Astoria is facing foreclosure. A group of resident children who call themselves \u201cThe Goonies\u201d go on a last adventure together where they find a hint of a buried treasure. I am vague here to avoid spoilers. Like I said it is a fantastic adventure that entrained me a lot. Together with the actors it is the strength of the movie. This is a fitting translation to the cast. All Goonies are excellent in their roles and because good child actors are rare this deserves even more praise. The adult actors also deliver so there is no misstep. I want also praise the humor, sets and effects too. Overall this is a charming movie many have fond memories of. It barley misses to become a classic but its definitely worth watching and remembering. I heard rumors they want to make a sequel recently and hope they never do.

I will admit Richard Donner's direction was a little too leisurely and there are some parts in the middle half that are too slow and falls dangerously into cloying sentimentality. Still this childhood favouriteThe Goonies, what a fun movie. I will admit Richard Donner's direction was a little too leisurely and there are some parts in the middle half that are too slow and falls dangerously into cloying sentimentality. Still this childhood favourite of mine is great fun from beginning to end. No matter how thin the story is, it has an intriguing premise and Donner and Chris Columbus keep the action going strong and the adventure fun enough for the younger audience. The script is funny and affectionate, the music is memorable and in general the special effects are good. The image of the pirate ship was mind blowing and the cinematography and costumes are very well done. The performances are very good; while Sean Astin and Corey Feldman are the standouts of the child cast, it is Anne Ramsey who steals the show as Ma Fetali in a effortlessly over the top and deliciously evil performance, very like Diana Dors in The Amazing Mr Blunden. All in all, a fun adventure yarn. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

As long as you are willing a lot of dumber moments in the film be, it's a great, fun viewing.The plot itself seems like nothing special today, but rather than itself being cliche, it's the Goonies that influenced the armada of films that make the plot so predictable.The characters sometimes feel like they are quite useless and that the plot could do away with few of them, as they only seem to exist for the sake of existing. It sometimes leads to quite loud scenes in which it's harder to discern to what we should pay attention. The quick changes in focus between characters make some scenes somewhat inconsequential. That said, the prominent characters really pop out with their quirky gimmicks, theatrical acting and how they set themselves apart from the rest.This film is a fairy tale dressed as an adventure film. Besides being a fresh breath of creativity in my recent film viewing, it's a lighthearted film, I believe almost anyone could enjoy.",

Hard to describe how disappointed I am...Scenario begins by being interesting but ends up being predictable, uninspired and shallow. The time everyone spends on this damned cave at the end is way too long. There are some poor parallel stories going on just to try to extend movie duration. How uninteresting! Characters are flat and dull. It is really hard to have any empathy for them excepted for Mickey and Brand Walsh at some few points of the story. I know it's a movie for children but does that mean they all have to shout and speak at the same time in this movie? I truly think showing this thing to kids is a total shame because of its constant vulgarity, its nonsense and its lack of intellectual depth. There are way too many stereotypes in this feature: girls are attractive and a bit dumb, they just want their first kiss as soon as possible, guys are here to be strong protectors, parents are here only in order to sign papers and prevent children to eat too many chips, fat kids are laughable, chinese create a lot of failed gadgets and so on.Special effects look really old. This feels like Indiana Jones but for children so the emergency exits and secret passages in the movie are really obvious.Bad guys oscillate between being truly dangerous as they almost tortured a child and crazy and deaf since they can't even manage to hear a dozen of kids in an abandonned house. The third brother is an abomination. I just don't write that because he is actually ugly but rather because he concentrates all the debility of the movie in himself. His presence completes those of the children as he can't stop shouting inarticulated words and insulting people. The movie morality is as ineffective as childish.Spielberg didn't hesitate to show commercial brands on screens using children's attention in one of the most perverse and insidious way. It is such a trash that it is hard not to give it a 0/10.",

I watched it once when I was very young in the early 2000's and blocked it out of my memory. Watching it again recently, I remembered why. It's about group of boys, aka The Goonies lead by Mike Walsh played by Sean Astin, who follow clues on a treasure map found in the Walshes' attic in hopes of stopping the foreclosure of his house- something every family can relate to. The crew ends up in dangerous tunnels beneath a dilapidated restaurant where they're pursued by a family of thugs.What I can't stand about this movie is the screaming about what's literally happening in each scene. If there's a skull in a room, you know at least 3 kids are going to scream \"SKULL.\" Bad guys are coming? \"THE BAD GUYS ARE COMING.\" Boat? \"BOAAAAT.\"The only plus side of this is it provides room for the characters to honestly express their feelings. When a little kid starts crying out of fear or heartbreak, you really believe the performance. You can't help but care about them,  like a friend after they **** their pants at a party and you had to drag them to your house that's getting foreclosed. I liked it.",
