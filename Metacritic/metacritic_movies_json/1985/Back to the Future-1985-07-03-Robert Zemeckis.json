    "summary": "Marty McFly goes back in time, in a DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown, and must make sure his high-school-age parents get together, so he doesn't cease to exist.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Among the plethora of innocent charms on offer, there's the near perfect script by Zemekis and Bob Gale which not only negotiates its time travel paradoxes with deft, exuberant wit but invests the light-hearted plot machinations with a seasoning note of honest drama.",
        "Entertainment of the purest kind, a picture so tightly plotted, wittily scripted and pacily directed that it's impossible not to dive in head-first and be swept gleefully along.",
        "There aren't many films we'd describe as perfect, but Robert Zemeckis's oh-so-'80s time travel tale fits the bill.",
        "Back to the Future entertainingly deals with the child's eternal question: If my parents had never met, where would that leave me?",
        "Mr. Zemeckis is able both to keep the story moving and to keep it from going too far. He handles Back to the Future with the kind of inventiveness that indicates he will be spinning funny, whimsical tall tales for a long time to come.",
        "Performances by the earnest Fox, the lunatic Lloyd, the deceptively passionate Lea Thompson, and, particularly, the bumbling-to-confident Glover, who runs away with the picture, merrily keep the ship sailing.",
        "It's funny. It's sad. It's imaginative. It's great sci-fi, and terrific family entertainment. In short, Back to the Future is brilliant.",
        "The picture packs a wonderful wallop.",
        "The movie, in fact, resembles Capra's \"It's a Wonderful Life\" more than other, conventional time-travel movies.",
        "Kids and parents alike are gonna dig this wonderful fantasy.",
        "Back to the Future stands up on its own as a well-oiled, brilliantly-edited example of new-school, Spielberg-cultivated thrill-craft, one that endures even now that its visual effects and haw-haw references to Pepsi Free and reruns seem as dated as full-service gas stations apparently did in 1985.",
        "Back to the Future is played neither entirely seriously nor entirely for laughs, and therein lies the nature of its success. It's funny and breezy but doesn't descend to a level where the characters are little more than props for jokes.",
        "Small-town America is portrayed with gentle, affectionate humour.",
        "The laughs are plentiful and the acting by Fox, Thompson, and Glover is superb. Robert Zemeckis's direction, like the technical contributions, is first-rate, and after an ambling start takes off into frenetic, non-stop fun.",
        "Director Robert Zemeckis confronts the oedipal heart of the time-travel genre with this zestfully tasteless 1985 tale.",
        "Highly entertaining, but that\u2019s about all."

This movie is by far one of the greatest Sci-Fi movies of all-time and is also in my top 3 favorite movies of all-time. This movie has a great concept and plot that later unfolds into one of the greatest storylines in the history of storylines. Michael J. Fox is fantastic as Marty McFly and delivers some of the most nostalgic acting I've ever seen, but my favorite performance was Christopher Lloyd's unforgettable, historic role as Dr. Emmett Brown. This character is what you get when you take one of the greatest actors ever and put them in your movie, you get one of the greatest movie characters in Science Fiction history. This movie mixes action with hints of comedy so perfectly that there isn't one point in the movie where you aren't interested in what is happening or what is about to happen.

Every foreshadowing is subtle, believable in the story and doesn't come off like a plot device. Every event or action in the movie makes perfect sense and is at the same time subtle and powerful. There isn't a time in Back to the Future 1 where I thought that something wasn't sensible or plausible, it all fits perfectly in a plot of great complexity that mixes romance, time traveling, science, and a lot of likeable characters of all types, nerdy  George McFly, aspiring rockstar Marty McFly, Lorraine McFly, Doc Emmett Brown, and even Biff, the movie's main villain.\r So it may not be the best movie ever, I mean other movies have been more memorable with one element or the other to me, but I certainly can't find a real flaw in it, it's a movie that's enjoyable in every one of its aspects and does every bit of the job just perfectly.",

Humor and charming characters are what makes this so great. Fantastic performances are all around and it's not hard to be taken in by the films magic, especially during the tense third-act. If it does have one flaw it's that this film has been to big of an influence for other time traveling science-fiction stories. A lot of the plot threads, like accidentally changing the events of the future, have been done to death as of today, and if you're like me and didn't watch this movie until many years after it has come out then this flaw becomes abundantly clear. Also the film gets surprisingly dark in content for one or two scenes (there's almost a rape). Overall it's a highly enjoyable film that had me laughing and on the edge of my seat. It may be a little familiar by todays standards, but it's still a great film and a classic.",

He has to create a romance between them so he could be born in the future. Dr. Brown, who invented the time machine in the future, is also his ally in the past, and together they must find a way to send him back to the future.\r The story takes place in the same town. The world is a different place in the 1950s from the 80s. The dressing, speech, tastes in music, all of it. Marty, as he says himself, has a life in the future he wants to return to. The plot was intricate and the dialogue sharp and witty. The eccentric Doctor can't go a second without putting a smile on your face.\r Marty's arrival in the past confuses a family living on a farm who take him for an alien. He flees from there and marches into the town still in his clothes from the future. At several instances, it is suggested that some of the popular culture was defined by Marty, such as skateboards and rock n roll.\r Marty's father, George, is bullied by the same man, Biff, who is also bullying him in the future. Marty starts working on helping his father stand up for himself. He regularly comes into conflict with Biff.\r George is afraid of any kind of social contact and Marty has his work cut out for him to convince him to ask his mother out so they could kiss and start a relationship. Much of the humour lies in Marty's struggles to spark fire between his parents which was messed up by his intervention.\r His mother, who should have fallen in love with his father, instead becomes infatuated with him. His horror at this development is funny because you know this is a comedy film and everything will work out in the end.\r 'Back to the Future' is possibly one of the most entertaining movies about time travel, probably because it didn't delve into hard science and combined elements of both science fiction and comedy.",

Fox) is the seemingly average teen who lives with a family that is at the bottom of the food chain, something that only seems to bother Marty.\rHe has a friend in the form of scientist Emmet \"Doc\" Brown (Christopher Lloyd), who informs him that he has created a time machine, something Marty can only snort at but soon must believe the ridiculous nature of it and get himself out of a big problem, returning to the future with the unnecessary tools to do so after he has accidentally landed in 1955. But the opportunities he has while trying to fix the DeLorean time machine are endless as he has the chance to repair the circumstances to which his mother and father met and to perhaps changes their fortunes, but this is going against the warnings his friend Doc outlines to him, that he cannot get involved in any situations that may alter the future as these could have dyer consequences.\rThe almost impeccable writing and direction from Robert Zemeckis promote a changing of the winds in science fiction film, he has played with the idea of time travel but delivered an energetic and larger than life story that is bursting with jokes, pop culture references and characters who all have their own traits that will change their fate, Lea Thompson plays the hilarious Lorraine McFly, mother to Marty, but someone who, in 1955, has the hots for the man who has travelled back in time, her son.\rWhether she is swooning after him or remarking on the nature of having your own name on your underwear (she thinks his name is Calvin Klein), her chemistry along with her future husband George (Crispin Glover), is a nice emotional kick for the film. But the real magic comes from Chris Lloyd and Michael J. Fox, who not only create to iconic characters, but also ones who are enjoyable to watch and easy to quote.\rThe film boasts excellent effects and a riveting score, and for re-watch value it is unmatched. A real gem can be hard to find in the current onslaught of big budget films, but Back to the Future set the benchmark and keeps on giving time and time again.",

It's funny! It's well put together! Michael J. Fox does a fantastic job as Marty McFly, and Christopher Lloyd does a fantastic job as Doc Brown. I thought the story was tense, and extremely well done. The way the past version of Hill Valley was sort of a parallel version of Hill Valley from 1985 was really smart, and using the clock tower which had been hinted to before was a great tie in. The ending was already pretty good, and then Doc Brown said \"Where we're going, we don't need roads...\" and the movie was officially made by that one line. However, nothing can be flawless, as there are some problems. First off, Biff was generic, and didn't have much character. I wish they had expanded on him. Also, the old people make-up on Marty's parents and Biff at the beginning of the movie isn't very good, and there's really no explanation for why the teacher hates Marty so much. Like I said, Biff is stereotypical, and Biff is an extremely cliche bully name. The closest thing to a plot hole that I can find is the fact that no one saw the car disappear when the lightning hit. I mean....really? It's especially \"convenient\" when it occurred RIGHT NEXT TO A SCHOOL DANCE, A.K.A, a very crowded place. Now that I think about it, technically at the end of the movie, Marty's family are totally different from who they'd been before, and Marty has no memories with them, which is pretty sad. Overall, in the future, I'll always come back to this movie. BACK TO THE FUTURE!\r Just as a side-note, I would have given this movie an 8.5 if Metacritic allowed for decimal ratings. The last thing I will say, is that Back to the Future had great music!",

Also for many this is one of the quintessential time travel movies and science fiction comedy. The strengths are the great cast, the good immersive story and that it has nearly a perfect pacing / build up. At the time of writing it is over 35 years old and still works for new and old viewers. It is the story of the teenager Marty McFly who comes from a struggling family with many problems. One night he meets Dr. Emmet Brown on a parking lot who claims to be his friend. There he shows him his newest invention which is a time machine he build into / with a modified DeLorean car. Sidenote: The DeLorean motor company was an American car manufacturer which got bankrupt in 1982. They are remembered for the gull wing doors and for this movie. In short their name entered pop culture history while they had no commercial success. Back to the movie. After some events I wont spoil Marty is stuck in the past on 05.11.1955 and has no way to return back to his time without help (To be precise he is technically home ). However this is not his biggest problem as time travel has consequences too or will have if you don't act carefully. I am vague here to not spoil the story. It has a great pacing, good twist and the actors enhance this with their performance. I rewatched this movie countless times and it has still nostalgic value. The movie has something everybody can relate to. Lets start with the great cast. This is Michael J. Fox signature role as Marty McFly and he is universally liked if not loved. It is such a natural performance that wins you over immediately. I cant picture anyone else in this role. Same goes for Christoper Loyd as Doc Brown. He nails the role of eccentric scientist. These 2 are perfectly for this movie and became pop culture legends in these roles. It stops not here as we get Thomas F. Wilson as Biff Tannen. He is one of the favorite bad guys in cinema and his performance is just great. I will praise Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover for their performance but wont spoil much. For all of these the movies became one of their most well know performances. I say we got a great cast and no missteps. Then I want to point out the special effect. It is amazing how good it looked back then. ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) are just the masters of special effects and also the gold standard. Even today it would be acceptable and I have seen worse from much newer movies. They got the look of 1955 right or the expectations. Everything looks and feels right. I must of cause talk about the soundtrack by Alan Silvestri. The \u201cBack to the Future\u201d theme is universally know but \u201cThe Power of Love\u201d became a timeless classic too. It is even played today in the radio and often reaches top positions in best movie songs. The rest is also excellent and worth buying. Before I forget it I must also praise director Robert Zemeckis who is in general not recognized enough for his works. Lastly I want to address the well done humor. They get the mixture of humor and seriousness right. Nothing harms the other and you will be entertained greatly. Overall this became rightfully a classic and started a successful franchise (It has no weak movies. Naming part 3 weak is nitpicking at best). It is the kind of movie that you will rewatch from time to time and have fond memories off. Fully recommend it as it is pop culture history.",

Fox) who is a typical 1980s teenager that hangs around with a scientist, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), and he has a girlfriend, Jennifer (Claudia Wells). Marty lives at home with his somewhat dysfunctional family, including his loser father, George (Crispin Glover), who often gets bullied by Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), and his cynical mother, Lorraine (Lea Thompson).\r One night, after the doctor invents a time machine in the form of a DeLorean, and tests it successfully, an incident occurs which leads Marty to get in the car and ends up travelling back to November 1955.\r Marty then runs into the younger versions of his parents, who at the time, still haven't met yet. He also tries to get help from the younger version of Dr. Brown to assist him getting back to the year 1985.\r The movie is wildly clever in regards to how it discusses the logic of time travel and what could happen if one was to travel back in time and alternate history. The special effects in this movie are top-notch and perfectly timed. It is a gorgeous film to look at, and the way it captures the 1950s era with its setting can really feel like the movie has taken you back in time.\r It uses the comedy very well in regards to its subject, and Michael J.

Following nationwide, jumbo opening July 3, grosses are sure to brighten the Summer of Universal Studios and such key filmmakers as director Robert Zemeckis and coexec producer Steven Spielberg.\r The central winning elements in the scenario by Bob Oale and Zcmeckis are twofold: hurtling the audience back to a very accessible year, 1955, which allows for lots of comparative, pop culture humor, and delivering a 1985 teenager (Michael J. Fox) at the doorstep of his future parents when they were 17- year-old kids. That encounter is a delicious premise, especially when the young hero\u2019s mother-to-be develops the hots for her future son and his future father is a bumbling wimp.\r Film is also sharply anchored by zestful byplay between Fox\u2019 Arthurian knight figure and Christopher Lloyd\u2019s Merlin-like, crazed scientist. The latter has mounted a nuclear-powered time machine in a spaced-out Delorean, which spirits the bedazed Fox 30 years back in time to the same little town in which he grew up.\r The film\u2019s opening 20 minutes or so, in present time, are intended to set up almost all one needs to know about the characters and the madcap vision of the scientist.\r Indeed, the first image on the screen, of countless timepieces ticktocking away, is an effective symbolic touch. But the filmmakers scramble too furiously here and the film doesn\u2019t find its control and its feet, and what a relief it is, until the hero is dropped into the same town in 1955 to the becalming background melody of the Four Aces singing \u201cMr. Sandman.\u201d Then the fun begins.\r Fox\u2019 wonderful goal, it eventually develops, is nothing less than making a man out of his father, who as a teenager is taunted by high school bullies and who is a peeping torn (of his future wife) to boot.\r In the film\u2019s opening sequences, the father (wonderfully played by Crispin Glover) is an unctuous nit wit, and the mother (Lea Thompson) a plump, boozy, turtle-necked frau. It is the rearranging of time and events by our stalwart heroes, the wondrous youth and his magician scientist, that sets up the surprise ending when the young lad goes \u201cback to the future\u201d to happily discover his family, including a brother and sister, living a life that would qualify as a trendy Southern California magazine cover.\r If the filmmakers\u2019 pre-\u201960s Be- Bop-a-Lula look occasionally suggests the \u201940s more than the \u201950s, the screen is constantly full of delightful comparisons: the old village-square movie house in \u201955 with a marquee showing Ronald Reagan in \u201cCattle Queen Of Montana\u201d has become a porno house in \u201985. The Studebaker lot is now peddling Toyotas.\r The quaint shops on the square in \u201955 are now squeezed into the metallic greyness of an outlying shopping mall. The malt shop has become an aerobics gym.\r None of these points are underscored but merely floating in the background as signposts of change. The most rousing and audience-grabbing scene of culture shock comes when Fox mounts the stage of a \u201955 high school band, says he\u2019s going to play an oldie, and digs into Chuck Berry\u2019s \u201cJohnny B. Goode \u201d at the dawn of rock \u2018n roll.\r You can see the end of doo wop, syrupy ballads and, for that matter, the fade-out of strapless prom dresses and baggy-cuffed slacks. But the mellow image of the fab \u201950s is the movie\u2019s nice, lingering image.\r Performances by the erstwhile Fox, the lunatic Lloyd, the deceptively passionate Lea Thompson, and, particularly, the bumbling to confident Glover, who runs away with the movie, merrily keep the ship sailing. Thomas F. Wilson as the bully (what a change he comes to) and Claudia Wells as a gorgeous contemporary girlfriend of Fox contribute good support.\r Film\u2019s time travel theme is sufficiently imaginative to remind filmgoers of James Stewart\u2019s fantasy travels in Frank Capra\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s A Wonderful Life.\u201d",

Stoltz, however, bowed out early during filming due to that ever-popular reason: \"creative differences,\" opening the door for Michael J. Fox (or, as nearly everyone knew him at the time, Alex P. Keaton). Would Back to the Future have become a modern classic with a different lead actor? That's as much of an unknown as what Casablanca would have been like with Ronald Reagan asking Sam to play \"As Time Goes By.\" What is known, however, is that the version of Back to the Future produced by Robert Zemeckis remains one of the mid-'80s most enduring and enjoyable confections: an infectious mix of comedy, fantasy, satire, excitement, and nostalgia.\r Back to the Future is played neither entirely seriously nor entirely for laughs, and therein lies the nature of its success. It's funny and breezy but doesn't descend to a level where the characters are little more than props for jokes. We believe in Marty, like him, and root for him to succeed. Part of the reason for that is Michael J. Fox, whose unforced screen charisma had already made him a huge television success. (He was the #1 reason Family Ties was a Sunday night staple.) Fox brought a lion's share of that \"aw shucks\" affability to Marty, and Back to the Future launched Fox's big-screen career. In order to appear in Back to the Future (once he had agreed to replace Stoltz), Fox had to go virtually without sleep. During the day on weekdays, he would film Family Ties episodes. At nights and on weekends, he made Back to the Future.\r Like Crocodile Dundee one year later, Back to the Future is at its heart a \"fish out of water\" story, about an '80s boy being trapped in a 1950s small town. His mother is smitten with him, the local bully doesn't like him, his dad is a wimp, and he doesn't fully understand the customs and lingo of the period in which he has become stranded. Plus, there are the twin difficulties of repairing a state-of-the-art 1980s time machine using 1950s technology and patching the damage his presence has caused to the time continuum. Zemeckis plays much of this with a light touch, but when there are opportunities for some excitement (as when Marty has a deadline to get to the \"finish line\" or risk not getting to 1986 until he's middle-aged), he milks it for all it's worth. Back to the Future leaves viewers a little breathless, but not drained - exhilarated and smiling.\r Nostalgia plays a role in Back to the Future's success. For kids in the '80s, it suggested the '50s of Leave it to Beaver and other black-and-white sit-coms that were in UHF re-runs around the time Back to the Future opened. For 40-somethings, the movie provided a glimpse of their past through rose-colored glasses (always the best way to remember high school). When the film is watched today, some 25 years after its release, the nostalgia is double-barreled. Now, the '80s scenes are as evocative as the '50s material.\r f there's a problem with Back to the Future, it's the film's ending, which left open the expectation that there would be more chapters to come. In fact, the movie was originally designed as a one-off project, with the final scene being a quirky way to wrap up things rather than a teaser for another installment. However, when Back to the Future topped the 1985 box office and public sentiment was high in wanting to know what the problem was with Marty and Jennifer's kids, Zemeckis went to work on Back to the Future Part II and III, which were filmed back-to-back and took four years to reach the screen.\r The '80s were a dark and cynical decade, remembered by most for excesses of consumption and greed. Back to the Future is unapologetically lighthearted and upbeat - a tonic for a weary movie-going society. Even its theme song (Huey Lewis' \"The Power of Love\") brought a smile to the face on its way up the charts to the #1 position. For Zemeckis, this represented an opportunity to join his buddy Steven Spielberg on the A-list - his next film would be Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, and Forrest Gump was less than a decade away. Like Spielberg, Zemeckis has a keen understanding of how to blend diverse elements of comedy, action, adventure, and drama into concoctions that win over audiences.\r It's the kind of alchemy that, on those rare occasions when it materializes, cannot be replicated - as the filmmakers discovered when they re-assembled for Back to the Future Part II. The magic lasted for one film, and that's the one to re-visit.",

It is 'today' to Marty but 'past' to Brown and other people. Therefore, I think Marty change only one thing, his family. In Marty`s past, they got unfair treatment, but, in Marty`s future, they become a high class.\r Watching this movie, I take a long time to think about time travel. I want to ask one question to you, If you go back to the past, can you change something in today? My answer is no, because all about today`s situations are caused by past things` conclutions. Your today is another`s past. However, in Back to the Future, Marty change his 1985s. In my opinion, it is just dramatic elements or the message that movie director want to send to audiences, \"humans are strong as can change the future.\" (or not)",

While having a typical 80s feel to it, which I like, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time travelling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

As the film became the 30th Anniversary in 2015, the three films became a 30th Anniversary Trilogy celebrating the release of the first film which gained massive praise from critics and audience. Yes, I watched the whole trilogy in one day, believe or not, but I'm going to get these two later until I'm finished with the first film. Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, who accidentally travels back in time from 1985 to 1955, where he meets his future parents and becomes his mother's romantic interest. Dr. Emmett Brown aka. Doc, played by Christopher Lloyd, his friend and the inventor of the time-traveling DeLorean automobile, who helps Marty repair history and return to 1985. OK, so what people love  about this film that has sense nowadays that I know this is a popular film and definitely the most popular Back to the Future film out of the trilogy. I love the story for what they've achieved with the first act where the story of the characters saying about what happened back in 1955 and when Marty is traveled in that year it goes what they usually do but not for Marty McFly 'cause he got hit by a car instead of George and now Lorraine, played by Lea Thompson, who now has the hots for him. Yeah, kinda weird while you think about it. For what I didn't know is that this film is used in pop culture such as what is \"Rick and Morty\" and that's all I know about that. I love the characters in which Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd plays along with the other actors. They both play fan favourite characters like Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly is a typical teenager who accidentally went back in time in 1955 and he wants to get back in the year 1985. From what I heard that Michael J. Fox has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease which kinda sucks but he did continued work. Christopher Lloyd for many people know as an eccentric scientist, Dr. Emmett Brown aka. \"Doc\" who built the time machine made from the DeLorean and is my favourite character of the film. I bet many of you know his quotable line is \"Great Scott!\" Lea Thompson plays an innocent Lorraine McFly who falls for Marty and his mother in 1985. Crispin Glover is George McFly who is a teenager in 1955 and Marty's father in 1985. And then Thomas F. Wilson as Biff Tannen, many people known him as the best character in franchise. His bully type really does suit the character really well and he throws in one of his catchphrases like \"What are you looking at, butthead?\", \"So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?\" and he hates being covered in manure. Also, I've heard the song \"The Power Of Love\" by Huey Lewis & The News and this is a good song. Christopher Lloyd appears in the music video as Doc Brown from the movie but what really caught me is Huey Lewis made a cameo appearance as one of the teachers. There's also a scene where Marty sings \"Johnny B. Goode\" by Chuck Berry. Yes, this song is in the 50's. In fact, Chuck was thinking about doing this song back in the mid 50's, believe it or not. You know, as much of these sci-fi movies that are popular at the time. Back to the Future is one of those movies you will have to see in the lifetime. It has great directing, fantastic writing, memorable characters, great performances and good effects. It boosted Robert Zemeckis' career up like he directed Romancing the Stone. This is one of my favourite films and my favourite sci-fi film of all time much like what others think of it when they put it in their Top 10 or many number movies. Do not miss this movie. Stay tuned for Back to the Future Part II.\"Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.\"",

DeLorean you ask? Well, sh*t, if you're going back in time, might as well do it with some style! Anyway, he gets sent back to 1955, where his future mother gets the serious hots for him, which is pretty awkward. And while she's gettin' wet over her future son, I'm trying to conceal a hard-on as I watch the movie surrounded by family and friend. I mean, really, Lea Thompson was a babe back in 1985 when this movie came out. I mean, she was pissin' hot! So, Marty has to hook up his parents, and makes some plan to get his future parents to fall in love at the Fish Under the Sea Dance, while staying one step ahead of that dumbass bully Stiff, I mean Biff Tannen (played by some Catholic comedian). Meanwhile, Doc from 1955 has to figure out how to get Marty back to 1985, and Marty has to warn Doc that he's going to get his ass blown by some Muslims! It's confusing, but you'll watch it, understand, and it'll be the best movie you've ever seen (unless, of course, you've seen JAWS, in which case, it's either way). So, it's a great movie, and the following trilogy was, overall, pretty good. If you love, action/adventure, romance, comedy, sci-fi, it's got all of that, and then some!

Robert Zemeckis can make things work perfectly by designing a lightweight movie that can entertain and make you laugh, but still smart enough to appeal to the most demanding audiences. The film never tries to be credible or scientifically accurate, nor is it required as it is clearly a comedy. The cast, in turn, is absolutely dominated by the excellent partnership of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, with a series of memorable dialogues in between. Both actors here have probably achieved the most notable roles of their careers. The other actors contribute perfectly.Special effects, visuals and sound are inseparable and important part of any sci-fi movie and here they work quite well. The soundtrack has also become iconic. In fact, the entire film has gained classic status, to the point that the film has been preserved as part of American cultural memory. For me personally, it is one of the most remarkable films of the eighties, which has aged very well and still has class, charm and style today.",

This is my favorite travel time for Sci-Fi, an epic comedy adventure in the 80's, and I love this movie to death! Excellent science fiction, fit epic, I LOVE the 80's. This is the simplest movie about travel time that has ever happened in the history of world cinema.This film is one of the best episodes of epic adventure film. The evaluation of Alan Silvester's musical theme is excellent, I could listen to him all day long. I also consider the playful actors such as Michael J. Fox (Marti McPlay) and Christopher Lloyd (Dr. Emet Brown). Despite the fact that this trilogy is 35 years since the first episodes of the first part, I will always redistribute the film and sometimes find different postings.who left the director for example a film that advertises in 2015 (the upcoming event of 2 parts), \"Jaws 19\" in 1989, the budo has already taken part 4 and the conductor was Stephen Spielberg and in the post of director 19 parts was Max Spielber son Stevenand there are still few of the force since there are as many different jerals that each part of the film has 88 departures and this is the speed required for travel in time. I love this franchise very much and will be glad to look at it again and again.",

Back To The Future represents one of those films, such a powerful, inspirational, comical, heartwarming, and innovative one. Probably, McFly and Doc Brown proffer the best duo-interaction I have ever beheld in an 80s film (which, happily, could end up being top-notch of all time). There are almost no blunders to be found because the flick essentially represents an instant classic of cinematic history as if to say, pure perfection. From this moment on, you might be thinking about the reason of having assessed the film as absolute perfection....First and foremost, we discuss relating to breaking formulas and experiencing new paths, in other words, means opening new cinematic genres and improving them, that is to say, films which leave a significant legacy. Back To The Future follows the proper steps to provide that brand-new feature we were all hoping. Secondly, we balance the film's highest moments and ordinary moments with humour, some 50's nostalgia, some drama and (even) some action moments which results in a win-win the film provides a mixture of genres carefully well-managed and accurately-needed. Third, if the goal is the production of an instant classic, we will need to focus on the cast, because they are the ones who will perform during the whole film, they embody the heroes and villains; therefore, they become fundamental. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are the film's core, as excellent as Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson's 2005 Wedding Crashers, I daresay. Finally, but not least, the soundtrack and the environment, in spite of ending up being complementary, provides not only a trusting reality but an opportunity to show the audience the plot's main incidents. During the display, we will notice the most recurrent spots are the 80's and 50's at school, at traditional coffee shops and the streets, not forgetting the excellent pop-culture references introduced....The audience ought to congratulate Robert Zemeckis' mind and, also, the crucial support of his staff (one of whom was Steve Spielberg) owing to this masterpiece. The montage is proof that everyone who has an incredible imagination is capable of creating chef-d'oeuvres, delivering the audience such an extraordinary time. What is more exhilarating is the fact that then-president Ronald Reagan loved the film to the point that he used famous BTTF quotes, for example, during his 1986 State of Union Adress. What an achievement ladies and gentlemen!...(91/100)",
