  "critic_reviews": [
    "For once, the audience isn't forced to surrender its intelligence (or its healthy cynicism) to embrace the film's sunny resolution.",
    "A hilarious and unexpectedly profound comedy.",
    "This movie has all the qualities necessary to be a crowd-pleaser: likable characters, charismatic performers, a strong, capably-executed premise, and lots of laughs.",
    "That glimmer of recognition is what makes Groundhog Day a particularly witty and resonant comedy, even when its jokes are more apt to prompt gentle giggles than rolling in the aisles.",
    "A demonstration of the way time can sometimes give us a break.",
    "Seeing it once is fine, but seeing it every day for the rest of your life is not recommended.",
    "There were a lot of ways for this film to go stupid; it succumbs to none of them.",
    "The funniest moments in Groundhog Day come when Phil takes sneaky advantage of his predicament-by, say, pumping a sexy woman in the local coffee shop for facts about her past and then, ''the next day,'' using the information to lure her into bed. What the movie lacks is the ingenious, lapidary comic structure that could have made these moments fuse into something tricky and wild.",
    "Dial your expectations to moderate, burrow in for the duration, and you won't be disappointed - it ain't exactly springtime, but there are worse things than an amiable outing on a winter's night.",
    "Considering that none of the characters is fresh or interesting, it's a commendable achievement that the quality of the storytelling alone keeps the movie watchable and likable.",
    "The film is inconsistent in tone and pace; fortunately the pay-off works, bringing some much needed warmth to the area.",
    "With its zany daily episodes, \"Groundhog\" gets stuck in a non-progressive repetition."

Following the broadcast he tries to leave town but finds himself caught in a snowstorm which forces him to spend the night. Unfortunately for Phil he awakes the next day to find that it is actually Groundhog Day again and again and again. At first confused by his predicament Phil soon realises that he can also use it to his advantage; to re-write the events of his day, and to generally have a whale of a time.\r The repeating day formula has now been done to death in movies and on TV but none have ever lived up to the quality of Groundhog Day. This is largely due to Bill Murray, always a brilliant comic actor, but is truly exceptional here. The movie does contain some darker moments as Phil finds himself losing hope but Groundhog Day is primarily a comedy, and an excellent one at that, and the fact that the term Groundhog Day has entered popular culture is the best testament to this.\r Often imitated but never bettered Groundhog Day is a must see movie.",

You also feel sympathy for him, because there are scenes in which he talks to this girl that he has a crush on and they meet for a night, tell stories, etc. He wakes up the next morning, asking her if she remembers what they did yesterday, and she has no clue what he is talking about, because it's the same day.\r Groundhog Day is a bit of a confusing movie, but if you're up for watching it, definitely don't miss this film!",

At first he tries to resolve the problem, and then he takes advantage of the circumstances, after that the meteorologist attempts to finish with his condition, and finally Phil reaches the maximum level of egocentricity believing that he is some kind of God, until he realizes that there is only one way to scape. What the whole thing represents is the path you need to go through in order to lose and find yourself, although the things that happen in the middle are of your business.This film has a great cast, starting by Bill Murray, which I think is the best performance of his career; also Andie MacDowell and Stephen Tobolowsky are incredible. The music is so nostalgic, my favorite is I Got You Babe by Sonny and Cher, and the form in which is interrupted by the broadcasters always makes me laugh. This is a special picture and I will never forget it, and if you think the Groundhog day is repeated to many times, I can say to you: that day is repeated the same amount of times as the days in a season.",

It takes a natural approach to the subject of how someone would react to living the same day over and over again, the first step is shock and disbelief, but onwards its fun and reaping the rewards of an unexplainable phenomenon, that's exactly what weatherman Phil (Murray) experiences as he covers Groundhog Day in Pennsylvania, he is a confident, egotistical and charming man who meets producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) who sees right through Phil and his over-zealous personality. As he begins to relive the same day, he starts to use it to his advantage to try and woo Rita, this is where we begin to see Phil seeing the error of his ways and his attempts to try and change his life. Murray brings real charisma and vintage charm to a simple role, his timing and reaction is in full force here where he uses his repetition of days for selfish means and also to impress flabbergasted onlookers for his 'predictions' of Jeopardy. This is an interesting tale of how repetition and routine can change ones outlook in their own life, whether they feel meaningless or not, it also shows the impact that he can have on others, but it also studies the fact that everyone has the room for change and never to settle for the same old thing, even though he sees it day after day. While the film can be too deliberately paced for some, it explores each avenue of such a life-changing event even if it happens again and again, realising the people closest to him matter most, whether co-workers or even homeless strangers, he tries to change everyone's life even in the smallest of ways.\rThis is a funny, touching and equally as inspirational piece of cinema that takes risks in the repetitive nature but ultimately pays off to see the change in one person, Bill Murray couldn't have been more likeable or sincere in his delivery as he struggles with not knowing how to get out of the rut he is in, and how to convince other people to see the change in him.",

Throughout, the repeating days never becomes old and tired, much the opposite in fact as every time he relived the same day it felt new and interesting. Plus, every scene never really ceased to be funny, as Bill Murray was undeniably at his very best in this film, both as a comedian and as an actor. In addition, the moral and events of this one are almost always very touching when they are not funny. Watching Phil Collins transform as a human being by living the same day is a great thing to watch and is also a credit to the great script for this one. The script manages to tell a story that has been told many times before in a very fresh and unique way, while almost tricking us into thinking it is brand new. That is not bad thing either, as it really makes this film all the more enjoyable and always leaves you wondering what is ahead next. Overall, this one is a very unique approach to a similar topic that never really feels tired thanks to its great acting, comedic elements, and script.",

It is determined to ultimately answer: How does one find true happiness. The kind of baby that might have been hatched by crossing Woody Allen and Dali Lama. What's truly amazing is that it pretty well achieves this without being pretentious or portentous. Its humble, pedestrian style coincides with it's charitable message. Furthermore, it's a riot!\r What do you do when the snowstorm of life traps you into a place you don't want to be? Self-destructive anarchy is an option: drinking, stealing, screwing, lying, joyriding and suicide. But this is a big storm so long-term solutions are required. The good news if you're lonely and unhappy? You probably have more time to dedicate to self- improvement (music lessons, ice sculpturing).\r But challenging the self must have worthwhile outcomes. Phil, believing he's magical, challenges himself to get Rita to sleep with him within 24 hours. He's being dishonest, still playing games and ends up getting slapped in the face repeatedly. It appears that Phil's obstinate pattern of narcissistic behaviour is the cause of this inert existential loop, and one that traps everyone he is in contact with. When he finally realizes that while money, sex and immediate self-gratification might have their perks, they are short-lived and vastly overrated, and a major personality overhaul will be required to escape this Kafkaesque nightmare. An endless, insanely frigid winter is bound to contain him (them (us)) unless new strategies are introduced, alternative energies adopted, the shift away from a self-serving paradigm sustained.\r To his credit, Phil refuses to be cornered in by the status quo and become one in a million zombies chanting “it is what it is”.  Phil actually starts to recover when he gives up trying. When he dismisses the quick fixes (sex, booze, anger, lying and fighting), when he relinquishes his ego and lets go of his smarmy King Joffrey-Justin Bieber juvenility, when he learns to be himself, like himself, settle into his own skin so he can thrive in and, in turn, improve his surroundings. In a reversal of \"It's a Wonderful Life\", rather than Bedford Falls being worse off from George's absence, Punxsutawney is better off with Phil's presence. Routine days require routine acts of kindness and Phil and the entire town collectively benefit from it. Phil is a born-again humanist, one who rescues himself from himself, escaping a solipsistic rotation of mutually-destructive behaviour simply by being a good Samaritan. The forecast: many rewarding days of sunshine.\r I always had a bit of a problem with the ending. That the cycle of unhappiness only ends when the guy gets the girl. But now I see that getting the girl was coincidental (and symbolic). Before he gets the girl he has to get himself. That's how you put a reverse spin on a downward spiral. The girl is now able to love the boy because he is love-worthy. The boy could be anyone. A politician. A corporation. You.",

Phil is not the nicest of men, not even to his co-workers Rita and Larry. But having to live the same day over and over again causes him to become a better person. He tried to save the life of a homeless man, save a kid from falling from a tree, and he even falls in love with his producer Rita.

I see this as a modern fairy tale that is as much for adults as for kids. The combination of the enjoyable idea, a charming cast with a great Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell and director Harold Ramis works excellent. It is a fantasy comedy that has elements of self discovery, a love story and a lot of philosophic elements that give a lot of depth. Also you can just see it as family film and it works also well. It is one of the movies you will rewatch once in a while with fond memories. The story is around the television weatherman Phil Connors. He, his cameraman Larry and producer Rita Hanson will travel to the small city Punxsutawney to cover the annual Groundhog Day festival for their TV station. This is actual torture for Phil who even does not hide his disgust for everything involved like the whole festival, town, coverage and citizens. This will get worse as he will end in a situation that will trap him in the town. I try to avoid spoilers here for those that do not know the excellent twist. The story works really well. The message and character development is a true strength. The movie is immersive, relatable and enjoyable. It has humor and seriousness where nothing harms the other. The conclusion is truly amazing and rounds up a great experience. Just as side note: The town of Punxsutawney and the Groundhog Day festival really exists but it was not filmed there. Just google it if you don't believe me here. Back to the review. I will praise Harold Ramis first as he is such a great director (also actor and writer). He deserved far more praise for his works as many of his movies are classics I and others don't want to miss. Now to the actors. Of cause this is an awesome performance from Bill Murray as Phil Connors. I say this movie was made for him as he could deliver the full range of his talents. He gives everything you want from a Bill Murray performance. I know the statement “The yin to the yang” is cliche but with Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson it fits perfect. She is the other half to Bill Murray’s performance and truly excellent. These two together enhance the movie. The actors who play the townsfolk of Punxsutawney are all amazing and deliver such a good and natural performance. The overall performance is so good you often forget it is a movie. I have to praise the whole cast for their great performance. The movie town of Punxsutawney is actually Woodstock in Illinois who is famous for this. It is a beautiful smaller city that gave a remarkable location for the movie with a lot of charm. I have also to praise the music. Of cause Sonny and Chers “I got you Babe” is an integral part of the movie. There are some classical music and more modern hits (for its time). Some are well integrated into the movies story. Overall I see this as timeless classic and must see movie. The story is so relatable and heartwarming. The conclusion rounds up the character developments as much as the movie. I can say movies like this are not made anymore and it would be true.",

Every audience member has a different set of criteria they use to measure their viewing experience. Not everyone shares the same set of criteria. If we did, what a bland and uninspired world this would be.\r What I Personally Liked About \"Groundhog Day\":\rFirst and foremost: Bill Murray. Seriously, how can you not like this man's performance? It takes a very skilled actor to craft an arrogant, sarcastic, unlovable **** of a character and actually turn him into someone the viewer cares about by the end of the film. The man is a genius with his delivery of lines, his facial expressions are dead on in every scene, and the suffering he feels over his burgeoning humanity can be shared by each and every member of the audience. Andie MacDowell creates a wonderful counterpoint to Murray as well. The semi-awkward chemistry they share feels natural and unrehearsed, both when it's obvious she is supposed to be disgusted by Murray's egocentrism and when she is supposed to be falling for his cute attempts at chivalry. I also feel that one of the most genuinely romantic segments of any film released from the nineties can be found in this movie: Murray and MacDowell dancing in the gazebo to the Ray Charles version of \"You Don't Know Me.\" I often wonder how many guys in real life tried to recreate that scene on one of their own dates. I'm betting there were at least a few who did.\r What I Personally Disliked About \"Groundhog Day\":\rMy worst complaint for this film is the schizophrenic nature of the comedy. The subtle bits work well; particularly the many deaths of Phil Connors montage (and the subsequent discussion about Phil's status as a deity) and the gluttonous indulgence Phil displays with the sweets and coffee. However, the blatant attempts to lighten the mood with material such as driving on the railroad tracks or the stealing of the groundhog just seem too over-the-top when trying to fit into the general mood of the film. They stick out like sore thumbs which have been hit by twenty pound hammers, to be frank. But that is a minor quibble which can be overlooked by the magnificence of the remainder of the movie.\r My Overall Impression of \"Groundhog Day\":\rExploring the concept of being allowed to (or rather forced to) live one day of your life over and over again until you get it right (or rather as reasonable a facsimile of \"right\" as you can get) is an enthralling notion for me. It was also extraordinarily different from anything else which was being done in romantic comedies at the time. Oh sure, you had the wacky weatherman story of Harris K. Telemacher two years earlier, however that film just didn't have the same warmth or the same staying power that \"Groundhog Day\" showcased to perfection. This is an incredible film that I have watched more times than I care to admit and will probably continue to watch more times than I am currently able to imagine.",

Harold Ramis could have done some better work in it along with editing the screenplay a bit tighter too; around 90 minutes would have been adequate. Bill Murray is excellent as the protagonist in this fantasy and he pulls it off all alone in his shoulder with head held high and doing some of his career's finest work.

The film portrays the journey of a television meteorologist to a smallIn the Eighties and Nineties, Bill Murray was one of the great comic actors, and this will be one of the most iconic films of his filmography. I have no doubt of that. The film portrays the journey of a television meteorologist to a small American town to cover the Groundhog Day ceremony (a ceremony that exists in real life) on 2 February. It turns out that this meteorologist is a detestable person with a bad and smug personality. Maybe because of this, he ends up getting stuck in time, reliving countless times the same day until he corrects his own mistakes.The film is not clear on the reasons why the main character gets stuck in time. Simply inexplicable, this phenomenon happened and allows the character to do the stupidest things knowing in advance that he will live everything the next day, so there are no consequences. Generally, I do not like movies where strange phenomena occur without the film explaining to the audience the reason behind it, and I may even consider it as a point against the film, but in this case I am willing to make an exception. In fact, this film is so funny and enjoyable that we do not care about the logical reasons behind the story. The movie works just as well: strange, illogical and funny. That is enough.Murray is the right man for the main character. He is the actor who always seems impassive and serious, even when around him the most stupid things unfold, as if all that were normal. And that makes the performance of this actor even funnier and appropriate for the character. Beside you, a capable cast of support allows you even more room to shine.I will not consider this movie to be brilliant. It was not even thought to be. It's funny, it entertains well the audience and makes laugh without exaggeration. This makes it enjoyable, and a good bet for anyone who simply wants to spend quality time.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nIt would seem like a pointless exercise - writing a review of a popular film, which has been released almost 30 years ago. Everything has long been written, criticized, rewritten, forgotten and written again. But when you revisit Groundhog Day again with a different baggage of experience than before, you begin to notice those aspects and perspectives that was not previously understood and perceived, even if someone noticed it. I will refrain from briefly describing the plot and praising the witty lines and acting of the ironic-cynical Bill Murray, as well as the charming Andie MacDowell, and focus on the main things.What would you like from your life if everything was allowed (and without any consequences)? I think a lot of people, at least me, will think about their old, unfulfilled dreams, about desires that they did not realize because of saving money, time or fear of consequences. The hero of the film, Phil, received such an opportunity - to become \"a god\" of a small world, the town of Punxsutawney. Having mastered his newfound power, Phil goes through mortal sins, starting with gluttony (a scene of gluttony in a cafe), fornication (seducing local beauties), greed (robbery of collectors), vanity (flaunting a Mercedes bought for stolen money with a young curvy blonde) and ending with anger and sloth (various suicide attempts and apathy). Satisfaction of all desires, as is clear from the sloth in which the hero fell, does not bring him joy. Satisfied desires become the same mindless routine that Phil suffered from before, but now there was nothing to strive for.A new goal is given to him by communication with Rita, with whom Phil is in love (and whom he could not seduce). \"Princess\" Rita, who studied for 12 years in a Catholic school and studied French poetry in college - the embodiment of impracticality, according to Phil, - also embodies in Groundhog Day the moral purity (kindness and beauty) that Phil strives for, but cannot achieve, admitting that he is not worthy of Rita. For the hero, she becomes a reference point and Phil tries to direct his capabilities not to the endless satisfaction of his desires, but to helping others and self-development. He begins to read a lot, learns to play the piano, carves sculptures out of ice, tries to get to know people and their problems. Phil does this \"out of fullness\", like God who has everything and tries to share the abundance with others, which gives him joy. Phil begins to feel joy, helping all the residents of the town day after day. However, he is still not omnipotent and realizes this, trying to help an old homeless man who, however, still dies at the end of the day, no matter how hard Phil tries. Looking at the sky Phil realizes that he is not \"omnipotent\", cannot raise the dead, but can imitate God, doing good deeds to the extent of his capabilities. This is also indicated by the final lines of Joyce Kilmer's poem \"Trees\", which Phil reads to Rita: \"Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree\". Phil transforms, sincerely loving neighbors as himself and helping them: he saves a boy who has fallen from a tree, the mayor who choked, helps the collector Felix to cure his back, helps the bride with wedding, gives a wedding gift and even buys unnecessary insurances from the annoying insurance agent. Rita notices Phil's transformation and falls in love with him. When the transformation and mutual love bring Phil the long-awaited tomorrow, he decides to stay with Rita in his beloved town, which he no longer considers a deaf and dull province inhabited by \"morons who like blood sausages.\" Whether intentionally or accidentally, Groundhog Day depicts the Christian's journey of love, repentance, death, and transformation. Only then does he find his way to \"tomorrow\" through the \"gates to Heaven\", like the heroes of the film, passing into their future through the hotel gate with the camera plan shifting to the sky.",
