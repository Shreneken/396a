  "summary": "The dogs can talk at a family of 4, where mom loses her job the same day dad gets a job as pilot for a cute, single boss.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The reason that the film (rated PG-13 for off-color dialogue) is borderline pleasant is because, even more than in the first two films, Travolta and Alley are a marvelous team.",
    "Though Alley, Travolta, and their canine counterparts do their zany best to be irresistible, Look Who’s Talking Now! probably won’t become a yuletide classic. Even so, the happy ending of this harmless comedy serves one purpose: reassuring doubting kids that Santa really does exist, a lesson parents might like — at least until the li’l ones climb into the big guy’s lap and ask for a dog for Christmas.",
    "Like an over-dressed Christmas tree, Look Who's Talking Now is a movie so eager to shine that it arrives draped in several layers of sentimental tinsel and cutesy-pie decorations.",
    "It's often a pleasant diversion, and much more entertaining than LOOK WHO'S TALKING 2, which over-extended the talking baby tricks.",
    "Comic interest is sustained by the entrance of prissy poodle Daphne (voice-over: Diane Keaton), but the preponderance of nudging innuendo was enough to earn the film a '12' certificate, thus excluding the audience of younger children who might otherwise have enjoyed the movie.",
    "The first film had maybe a shred of realism to flavor its romantic comedy. This one looks like it was chucked up by an automatic screenwriting machine.",
    "Even Charles Barkley's big-screen acting debut can't camouflage a wandering script built on formulas and cliches. As for John Travolta and Kirstie Alley, suffice it to say that their pets steal every scene, and, when the dogs aren't present, the furniture takes the honor. Look Who's Talking Now has about as much appeal as the pile that Rocks leaves on the back seat of James' cab.",
    "Unsurprisingly this film is weak. The final film in a weak trilogy, filled with weak characters, who have weak dialogue and feature in a, you guessed it, weak plot. Thankfully Travolta's next film would be Pulp Fiction giving his career a well-needed boost, it's a shame the same couldn't said for Allie.",
    "One nagging point: Pic seems aimed at kidvid market, but it revels in its ongoing references to open sexuality, including a reprise of opening credits that run over a microscopic view of squirming sperm. Very tasteful.",
    "Lie down with dogs like Look Who’s Talking Now! and you’ll end up with fleas.",
    "Take the \"dle\" out of \"poodle\" and you've pretty much got the leitmotif of Look Who's Talking Now, a crude and mawkish film in which dogs attempt to communicate with Kirstie Alley and John Travolta.",
    "The amazing thing in Ropelewski's film is just how much of this lowest-common-denominator pabulum has been recycled from the foul spillage of the previous two films. Once again, needlessly, we're treated to lengthy scenes of the family singing and clowning about with treacly plasticity, fantasizing, dreaming, whining, mewling... it's all too much, grating on your nerves and leaving you desperately in need of a healthy dose of cinematic sanity. Or, at the very least, genuine humor."
