  "critic_reviews": [
    "Though the story in Carlito’s Way is treated in a fatalistic sense, the moment-to-moment, frame-to-frame experience is anything but rigid and stodgy from over-determination. It sings, dances, punches, slinks, embeds. It moves like the luxurious tracking shots that punctuate the film.",
    "Utterly compelling - Sean Penn is a powerhouse in support - and with a railway station set - piece in which De Palma actually betters what was his previously Untouchable effort.",
    "Penn, with curled hair and wire-rims, makes a brilliant, slippery high-end shyster; his modulated hysteria is amazing. So is Brian De Palma’s direction. Few films actually made in the disco era can match the kinetic allure of this 1993 production, which has a bluesy undertow all its own.",
    "Carlito's Way, like Casualties of War and Mission: Impossible, seems to stand at a nexus between commercial fealty and directorial idiosyncrasy; it's a sort of half-breed film that exudes personal vision but functions satisfactorily for the multiplex crowds at the same time.",
    "The acting here, by Sean Penn, is a virtuoso tour de force - one of those performances that takes on a life of its own.",
    "With a concluding chase/shoot-out episode that might even make Hitchcock jealous, Carlito's Way is a dandy piece of entertainment. If the story needs a bit more depth and reason, who really cares? There's hardly time to notice.",
    "Carlito’s Way is perfectly okay entertainment, yet this 2-hour-and-21-minute movie never convinced me it wouldn’t have been every bit as good (if not better) as a lean and mean Miami Vice episode.",
    "Al Pacino gives an urgent, bravura performance as the title character.",
    "Big and violent, dark and operatic, both stingingly real and maddeningly overblown. But what gives it resonance is Pacino's performance.",
    "Handsomely made, expertly directed and colorfully acted, it should satisfy action buffs and slightly more sophisticated audiences. That adds up to solid commercial prospects at home and abroad that are just shy of blockbuster returns.",
    "Below the attention-getting surface, there's no sense of humanity underneath. The day De Palma pulls away the masks from his characters, they'll start to breathe -- and so will his films.",
    "A mid-level commercial thriller, it is a solid and acceptable if not overwhelmingly exciting piece of work from a star and a director not previously known for their centrist tendencies.",
    "Carlito's Way is best watched as lively, colorful posturing and as a fine demonstration of this director's bravura visual style.",
    "It runs long and is ultimately not much more than a showpiece, but Pacino looks every inch a movie star, and De Palma provides a timely reminder of just how impoverished the Hollywood lexicon has become since the glory days of the '70s.",
    "Carlito's Way probably should have been a taut thriller, but choices by DePalma in both presentation and editing have hamstrung it.",
    "About halfway through, the overwhelming fact that the movie is a complete nothing becomes too much to ignore.",
    "There’s a secondhand feel to the way this gangster movie delivers the goods. Carlito’s Way is haunted by a ghost from De Palma and Pacino’s past — Scarface."

From the misplaced accent, to the hammy\"Carlito's Way\" finds \"Scarface\" collaborators Al Pacino and Brian De Palma reteaming within the realms of the crime epic. This time around, though, the wear and tear is evident, particularly in Pacino. From the misplaced accent, to the hammy voice-over work, his performance didn't really pass the smell test for me. Seemed like he was kind of phoning it in here. That being said, he's still watchable, with his innate charm and likability carrying you through the watch just so. A genuine shout-out has to go to Brian De Palma and his ability to film a frenetic set piece. The gunfights and chase scenes (particularly the one at the end of the film) are really terrific sights to see. I only wish there was as much attention put into the characters and drama. In longer movies like \"The Godfather\" or \"Heat,\" even the tiniest of moments and characters feel significant. No time is wasted. Here, a lot of moments and characters either feel simply \"there\" or like a retread of something we've seen in a different film. I know it seems like I'm bagging on this movie a bit too much, but with names like Pacino and De Palma on a movie poster, you tend to expect more than this ended up being.",

So far it is my favourite Brian De Palma film alongside Carrie and The Untouchables. De Palma's direction itself is terrific, while some of the set pieces such as the pool fight, the 15-minute subway chase and the shenanigans on the train-station escalator are among the best in any De Palma film.The cinematography is excellent, the lighting is used in an interesting way and the scenery and locations are striking. In short, the film looks good. The soundtrack drives the film very well too, the script is smart and funny and the story is ceaselessly compelling. The pace is spot on, and the acting is very good. Al Pacino gives a suitably restrained performance which was a refreshing change from his excessive performance in Scarface, while the supporting cast have plenty of time to enjoy themselves.In conclusion, a fine film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Like most films by Brian De Palma, he's known for making his films look stylish making the shots long like some he did back in the day make the angles look unique. It'll let you know what was going on if something goes wrong. Al Pacino as Carlito Brigante, who used be a criminal after spending five years of a 30-year prison sentence vows to go straight and get into any illegal activities But that proves to be difficult when he ends up being dragged into the same activities that got him imprisoned in the first place. His lawyer, David Kleinfeld played by Sean Penn, keeps him out of trouble while he meets his girlfriend Gail played by Penelope Ann Miller. From what I am seeing so far I'm liking very much, granted the fact that it has pop songs that you heard about much like the ones I've heard of before. The chemistry between Al Pacino and Penelope Ann Miller is really good. You can see that they're really meant for each other. I really love the climax chase scene at the end, it is very thrilling and it left me on the edge of my seat. This is something that I should look up on very soon but what can I say, it is worth it. Carlito's Way may not be memorable to others like Scarface but it is an interesting crime thriller by Brian De Palma and stars Al Pacino.",

Penelope Ann Miler is pretty unbearable. Whining, ranting or blubbering throughout the entire run-length. Even her obnoxious dancing during the credits is annoying. Sean Penn is pretty good as the scumbag lawyer, and although Pacino does his best with a lightweight script and dull dialogue, but he's just phoning it in and ends up coming off as a parody of himself. The ending is quite strong and the tension is palpable, but yet another plot hole does away with it.",
