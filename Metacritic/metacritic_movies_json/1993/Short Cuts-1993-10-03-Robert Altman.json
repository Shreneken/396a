    "summary": "Using the short stories of Raymond Carver as inspiration, Robert Altman revisits the formula of his 1975 film \"Nashville,\" portraying various interlocking stories set against the backdrop of contemporary middle-class Los Angeles.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Los Angeles always seems to be waiting for something. Permanence seems out of reach; some great apocalyptic event is on the horizon, and people view the future tentatively. Robert Altman's Short Cuts captures that uneasiness perfectly.",
        "Part of the miracle of Robert Altman's triumphantly fierce, funny, moving and innovative Short Cuts is that you can't get this movie out of your head. You keep playing it back to savor its formula-smashing audacity, its peerless performances and its cleareyed view of blasted lives.",
        "The movie equivalent of a great read. It's a masterfully conducted concert of characters...already head and shoulders above most of the competition.",
        "Exploding Raymond Carver's spare stories and minimally drawn characters onto the screen with startling imagination, Robert Altman has made his most complex and full-bodied human comedy since \"Nashville.\"",
        "Carver's stories are obviously inspiring for Altman, and that's the point, this movie is bursting at the seams with ideas and energy.",
        "It's a genuine pleasure to find a movie with such a deep and intelligent portrayal of simple human lives, with all their minor triumphs and tragedies.",
        "At first, it's hard to sort out who knows who and where the stories connect, but it eventually comes together, combining the gripping power of a soap opera with the skewed, unusual perspectives of Carver and Altman.",
        "Quirky, sometimes brilliant, and mostly ice-cold.",
        "Inevitably it's a mixed bag, though the film's assurance in keeping it all coherent is at times exhilarating.",
        "Altman shakes the camera like a two-bit horror director, and it seems a different sort of signature - less masterful than weary, less signed than resigned. Zero-sum, indeed.",
        "A cynical, sexist and shallow work from cinema's premier misanthrope, Robert Altman, who here shows neither compassion for -- nor insight into -- the human condition."

Critiquing modern society, marriages, infidelity, and more, Short Cuts is a film with a ton of moving pieces, courtesy of a variety ofAn ambitious, cynical, and character driven film, Short Cuts is loosely plotted, but always engaging. Critiquing modern society, marriages, infidelity, and more, Short Cuts is a film with a ton of moving pieces, courtesy of a variety of storylines. Each storyline and set of characters interacts with others in very natural ways that link their stories. Above all, it really shows how flawed we all are and the fragility, mistrust, and lies, that permeate modern day marriage. Through these vignettes, it quickly becomes clear that Altman has a very cynical opinion towards modern day marriage and people's ability to remain faithful to their spouse and not act in their own self-interest.One of the best portions of this film is the acting. With such a large cast, obviously there are a lot of terrific actors and boy do they every display it in this film. Leading the way is Julianne Moore. As an eccentric artist who largely paints nude women, she portrays Marian Wyman. Married to Dr. Ralph Wyman (Matthew Modine), she and Modine share one of the best scenes in the film. Confronting his wife about an event three years ago when he believes she cheated on him, the moment is intense and incredibly powerful. Moore's performance in this moment really hits a fever pitch of intensity and emotional rawness that define her character. She is very open throughout and even does this scene without her pants, which really shows what makes her character tick. She is raw and a passionate person and Moore really captures this brilliantly, especially in this moment. Alongside her, Jennifer Jason Leigh is often scene stealing here. Appearing as Lois Kaiser, a married mother of two who is a sex line worker, one of the funniest encounters of the film is her talking dirty to a customer, which upsets her husband. Wondering why she does not talk to him like that, her reaction to this apparent absurdity and comical reaction to her work is hysterically put together, bolstered by Leigh's performance.Yet, what is really impressive is the writing. Thinly plotted, the film is never anything less than engrossing. It keeps you fully engaged and entertained throughout because of the writing. The characters are nuanced, with most of them being neither fully good or bad. They all act, talk, and walk like real people. Robert Altman introduces a variety of characters and uses them brilliantly to explore the state of marriage and the turmoil that ensues. Issues regarding infidelity, different desires, lack of passion, death of children, and depression, all ensue and are beautifully depicted. The acting helps here, as it is all very grounded and authentic, but the writing is really what creates this impact. Instead of introducing storylines and dropping them, Altman delves into them and shows them from varying perspectives. In one relationship, a man cheats. In another, the woman cheats. How is the dynamic different? This is explored in Short Cuts, as well as other marital issues that can arise. All are given the heft and weight they demand, which is a real treat to watch unfold.For a three hour long film, Short Cuts honestly feel quite short. Its acting and writing is so engrossing, it never slacks. Compared to Altman's past film of this type, Nashville, it is hypnotic. While Nashville is a great film, it does sometimes feel its length. Short Cuts, however, is streamlined and consistently powerful. That said, the comparisons to Nashville are apt as they are not just Altman films, but both use music in interesting fashions. Through Tess Trainer (Annie Ross) and her singing in a club, which brings a few characters into the bar, we hear songs such as \"To Hell with Love\" or \"Prisoner of Life\". Thematically, these are great fits as the film largely explores the pain that can come from marriage and the problems that arise. Yet, having a spouse and kids, as most of the characters do, can leave one feeling trapped and stuck with their current way of life, even if its unhappy. This is a constant in Altman's films and Short Cuts is hardly an exception as, though he explores dark themes here, it is done through music and the musical choices accentuate the thematic excursions.A poetic and moving look at life, marriage, and death, the film explores issues that can arise once we are married. The animosity, loss of passion, or infidelity, that plagues modern marriages are on full display in Short Cuts with brilliant writing and acting to boot, which does its sensitive subject tremendous justice. Honestly, this is as near to a masterpiece as I have seen in my mild binge on Robert Altman in the past few weeks.",

Short Cuts? Is it even Altman's best work? Well, everything unique and original in the other movies on this list was done before... by Altman. (Is there anything the man hasn't tried?) And everything Altman achieved in his career can be summed up in Short Cuts.\r Five of the entries on my list are genre intact: gangster, war, bio, sci-fi, adventure. Lynch is a genre of his own (a master of hook and subvert), Pulp Fiction is pomo-noir with a swagger, Tree of Life, an audacious and transcendent poem, Boyhood, literally an epic achievement of dedication and commitment. Short Cuts doesn't seem to fit in as it is merely an observation of lives and love. But what observations! What lives! What heartbreaking affection. All underscored with a resonating heartbeat patching into so many paths, teetering on the brink of disaster and threatening to explode, which it does, in the form of a climactic planetary stroke. Nothing brings people together quite like a natural disaster. An earthquake, tremoring just enough to inform us of our place in history on the cosmic map. Enough to bring us down to earth, reboot our egos, and put multiple perspectives in perspective. Enough to appreciate the simple state of being.\r A larger-than-life baroque master is at the helm, warbling out contrapuntal narratives and swirling themes orchestrated to perfection. Multiple story-lines wavering under one very singular umbrella. And under Altman's protective cover the talent runs free and easy, playful and experimental, ironic and sincere. The key characters in one story become walk-throughs in another, paradoxically tethered and disconnected from the self, from family, community, and life. Boundaries are crossed and souls get lost. We're all the same if only by not knowing what our needs are or why we're even here. With nothing to say except everything is exceptional, infinite and empty. And life is short. Shorts Cuts of scenes stories words actions desire love loss lies lust faith wonder and devotion. Heck, I'd see it again only to watch Tom Waits and Lily Tomlin shack up.\r Some movies claim to be infinitely entertaining, some maintain they can be viewed repeatedly without losing their initial charm, some insist they never age, I know only one that can lay claim to all such conceits. Short Cuts is like falling in love. It delivers quietly, wonderfully, naturally, tenderly, simply and deeply.",
