        "Though many characters are dispatched in various gory ways, the film gives them more to do than the have-sex-and-die victims of past entries. Director Adam Marcus and writers Dean Lorey and Jay Huguely give them some personality, and the acting is also generally better than in the previous Fridays.",
        "The scriptwriters try to conjure some history/mythology to validate the plot's twists and turns, but the whole thing ends up more confusing than Days of Our Lives on fast-forward.",
        "A largely incoherent movie that generates little suspense and relies for the majority of its thrills on close-up gore.",
        "Jason goes to hell, and not a moment too soon. His descent has been far too long in coming, as the exhausted, witless Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday demonstrates.",
        "While the Nightmare on Elm Street movies possess a sick yet clever surrealism, and the first Halloween was at least well crafted, the Friday the 13th series has always been the cut-rate horror franchise, offering barely functional sex-and-slash pitched straight at the moron brigade. Jason Goes to Hell varies the formula a bit, with ideas swiped from The Terminator, The Hidden, and Alien, but after nine installments the impalements and dismemberments all look the same. So go to hell already, Jason \u2014 and take Sean Cunningham, the \u201dbrains\u201d behind this dreck, with you."

I feel that now I have got this far through the series that I am owed something from the Jason character. This film did not make me feel good. The story was truly stupid meandering along complexities that I will never try to understand. Thankfully this dull entry to the saga contains all that wonderful uncut violence that made me fall in love with the first film. Some truly sick vile moments of maniacal madness. This really did not fit in with the other films, a maverick if you will. The perplexing story fails the most and fails with shuddering ineptitude. Take a look to complete this long series of Jason films or if you want to watch some ultra-violence. Sending Jason to hell was cool no matter what trash came before it.",

It all begins when Jason tries to takedown an undercover FBI agent (whose footwear keeps changing as she's chased through the woods) and he's blown to bits in a spectacular, over the top fashion. The doctor doing the autopsy is seduced into eating his black heart and from than on it's a whole bunch of body switching like 1987s The Hidden but way amped up. The masked maniac is a demon parasite in search of a family member so that he can become his old self again. It's all a bit goofy and there are some unintentional funnies but who cares. The movie is fantastically gory and overly entertaining. Not only does it have the best kills of the series but also has the best kill of any slasher ever. The \"tent split\" is beyond amazing and needs to be experienced in it's full unrated cut like the rest of the glorious film. And as a horror fan how can I not appreciate all the homages and genre universe expanding. From the Halloween references to the Necronomicon from Evil Dead which makes Jason a full fledged deadite to freddy's glove dragging his mask into hell. It's all an absolute crazy, goretastic, insanely fun bundle of genre goodness.4.25/5",

Those who say the remake was awful, have you seen Jason Goes to Hell? ..Good : There is an interesting character - Duke. He seems interesting a lot. He doesn't do anything significant to shine in the movie, he is just dumping expositions. But the actor makes it likable. If we accept this s**t, the movie isn't as terrible as it is said to be, at least not as terrible as the last two. ..Bad : Yet another f**king whacked out Friday the 13th movie! This feels like a forced piece of s**t that is there just to set up Freddy vs. Jason. So far, there has been no mentioning of supernatural origins of Jason, not even hinted. Freddy's Dead is a garbage film. At least it has only mentioning about the tadpoles that powered him throughout the series. We know about his origins from the subsequent movies. Here, everything is done via exposition. Jason's bloodline plotline is just super crammed for not letting this movie die. I said the movie is whacked out, I definitely don't like this piece of s**t. But it is entertaining in \"that\" way and only in \"that\" way. If we had some better characters in a better setting and in a fantasy franchise, I think the ideas for this movie could've worked. But it feels like a dispassionate job of a totally bored creative team. Jason possessing people is another s**t that has never been explained at all. This movie is just a train wreck of weird ideas put on screen. The new elements do not make Jason more interesting. He is perhaps the most goofy and overrated villains of the horror genre. I won't say anything else. It's very boring talking about this movie. ..Conclusion : It is just a generic Disney witchcraft film which is a bit darker, a bit gory and features Jason. That's the perfect way to put it. As I like the fantasy witchcraft things, I enjoyed it a bit more than others. Else, it's nothing good. ..Rating. ..Score : 1.8/10Grade : F",

This movie masquerades as a sequel but is entirely irrelevant and quite honestly shouldn't be considered a slasher film. I understand that people were complaining that F13 movies are too samey, but no one (not a single person) asked for the entirely lore of the franchise to be retconned. They wanted a new movie. Not a new genre/seriesHowever ignoring all of that, it's still a pretty bad movie. Too many potholes, random anime blades, unexplained information and the middle meanders despite being on the shorter size. While the love interest wasn't boring as they usually are in F13 movies, she was annoying. This isn't me just blindly hating the movie however. Its highlights are genuine highlights that are too hard to ignore. It's the first movie with ACTUAL good actors for once. The main character was endearing, the bounty hunter man was a cool guy and the love interest was well acted. The problem is that the writing gave them nothing to work with as their script/concept was pretty dumb. The beginning with the twist before the credits was really cool and I loved the effects. Plus the last 15 minutes were actually a 9/10 movie. Overall, 90% of its faults have to do with the horrendous writing even for an F13 movie. Whoever made/okayed this script/direction should be fired in all honesty. Everything else was pretty good and would've made a legitimately good movie in other circumstances, but the writing/script/concept was ACTUALLY that bad.",

Besides the first movie, we don\u2019t get Jason hardly at all in this movie (I know A New Beginning doesn\u2019t have Jason, but we get someone at least dressing like him!). But it is the goriest Friday the 13th movie to date.PLOTThe FBI \u201ckills\u201d Jason and takes his body to the morgue. Due to his body being in pieces, Jason possesses people in order to get back to Crystal Lake and find a way to get his body back. In the way is the usual teen victims and stupid adults. A bounty hunter may hold the information that can stop Jason for good.MY THOUGHTSI\u2019ll have a Voorhees burger and a side of Jason fingers.\u2013DukeWow! A lot to unpack. Not sure I\u2019m liking the whole Jason possesses people instead of actually seeing Jason. But can I say, I\u2019m not hating the male nudity in this? LOLStarting with the kills. I did like the fact that Jason Goes to Hell is the goriest of the movies (up to this point). We get some good bloody kills. I like the kill where Deborah (Michelle Clunie) is stabbed and torn in half with a spike. I also liked the effects when Deputy Josh (Andrew Bloch) after transferring \u201cJason\u201d just melts. We get to see the effects, and I think the K.N.B. Effects Group did a great job with it. There were a lot of kills in this installment and a lot of good kills. Come on. One woman had her face pushed into her head by someone possessed by Jason! LOLThe acting wasn\u2019t too bad. I think Richard Gant did a pretty good job when possessed by Jason. Steven Williams as the bounty hunter was just the right amount of jackass in the beginning. Steven Culp is his usual slimy jerk (he\u2019s usually pretty good at that role). I had totally forgotten that John D. LeMay was in this movie. Nice little tie in between the movies and the TV show (even though they don\u2019t have anything to do with each other). I think, for the most part, the male roles were more outstanding than the females. Though I do think Kari Keegan as Jessica, the final girl did better than Rennie from Jason Takes Manhattan.There are a few props from other horror movies planted throughout the movie. The Necronomicon, from the Evil Dead series, can be found on a table in the Voorhees house. Also in the house, in the basement, is a crate that is from the story \u201cThe Crate\u201d in the movie Creepshow. Outside of the Voorhees house is the jungle gym used in Hitchcock\u2019s The Birds. And finally, the most well-known is Freddy\u2019s glove at the end from A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. As a side note, the actor using Freddy\u2019s glove is Kane Hodder. He\u2019s the only actor to play both Jason and Freddy.Now to the negatives. As much as I liked the special effects for the kills, the hands dragging Jason down in the end sucked. They were just really cheesy (and not in a good way). I already mentioned I didn\u2019t like the fact that Jason was hardly ever in the movie. And I think the baby storyline was not needed but that\u2019s just a minor detail.Overall, I\u2019m surprised with this rewatch. It\u2019s not as bad as I remember. Still not the best, but may not be the worst. Interesting how your views on a movie changes as you get older.The reason that this film is titled \u201cJason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday\u201d instead of \u201cFriday the 13th Part IX\u201d or something similar is that New Line Cinema did not have the rights to the name \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d. This was the first film in the series made by New Line Cinema instead of Paramount.This is the first Friday the 13th-related film to have another Voorhees in the movie since Friday the 13th (1980).Josh\u2019s death won the Golden Chainsaw Award in Dead Meat\u2019s \u201cJason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (R Rated Cut)\u201d kill count, while Deborah Caldwell\u2019s death won the award in the Unrated Cut.
