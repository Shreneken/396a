    "critic_reviews": [
        "Inherit The Wind acutely captures the farcical Monkey Trial and offers the awesome talents of two double-Oscar winners, Tracy and March, in their only film together.",
        "It is Inherit the Wind among all of Kramer's films that seems most relevant and still generates controversy.",
        "A searing indictment of religious fundamentalism and anti-intellectualism. Inherit the Wind\u2019s relevance continues beyond its immediate parallels with McCarthyism.",
        "One of the most intelligent, respectable and entertaining motion pictures of this year.",
        "This is a rousing and fascinating motion picture. Producer-director Stanley Kramer has held the action in tight check.",
        "Tolerably gripping in its old-fashioned way, thanks chiefly to old pro performances from Tracy and March as the rival lawyers and ideologists, but rather let down by Kelly's inadequacy as the cynical journalist who is comfortably denounced as the real villain of the piece.",
        "Spencer Tracy does his cuddly curmudgeon turn as Clarence Darrow; it's a lazy, vague performance, but its wit provides the only crack of light in the film's somber, gray overcast."

The story and the dialogues are great and demand some thinking of the views.On the other hand both protagonists overacted a bit in my view and the theme is a bit ridiculous today. But this is interesting also, because dont forget, there will be always stupid opinion in the public, just like the opinion of the town folks.",
