  "summary": "Five career criminals in New York are rounded up for a standard police line-up. After release, they get together for a bit of revenge by pulling off a $3 million emerald heist. This scheme brings them to the attention of an underworld crime figure who convinces them to do a highly dangerous job.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The Usual Suspects is an ironic, bang-up thriller about the wages of crime. A terrific cast of exciting actors socks over this absorbingly complicated yarn that's been spun in a seductively slick fashion by director Bryan Singer.",
    "This movie has everything but Humphrey Bogart, and I'm sure he's sorry he was unavailable.",
    "This one's done right. Here's an intelligent movie with no special effects. You have to pay close attention, to listen hard to its cross-fires of dialogue.",
    "A movie with style to burn, and, initially, that is this crime drama's most mesmerizing aspect.",
    "Dense, ironic and thoroughly engrossing caper melodrama.",
    "The Usual Suspects is an accomplished synthesis of noir elements and, as such, is an entertaining entry to the genre.",
    "The Usual Suspects filled me with a highly unusual urge - to be a true \"reviewer,\" to rewind the projector and figure out this humdinger once and for all.",
    "Byrne is a stand-up poet the way some actors are stand-up comics. His innate depth prompts The Usual Suspects to transcend its own cleverness--and this is the movie's smartest, least predictable surprise.",
    "This thriller is like a game of life-and-death chess, with quick double-crosses and wild gambits.",
    "The Usual Suspects is a maze that moviegoers will be happy to get lost in, a criminal roller coaster with twists so unsettling no choice exists but to hold on and go along for the ride.",
    "For my money, The Usual Suspects was the pulp fiction of the '90s.",
    "Dense with plot intricacies, thick with atmosphere, and packed with showy roles for a hip ensemble.",
    "Look out for everything, and listen, too, because Suspects is one of the most densely plotted mysteries in memory.",
    "Screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie's tough-guy dialogue and Bryan Singer's crisp direction give the ensemble cast every opportunity to shine, and they do.",
    "Self-consciously bleak.",
    "Nothing more than an over-designed lobster pot. After following the beckoning twists and turns, you're left trapped and more than a little disappointed for getting in so deep.",
    "To the degree that you will want to see this movie, it will be because of the surprise, and so I will say no more, except to say that the \"solution,\" when it comes, solves little - unless there is really little to solve, which is also a possibility."

No one cracks and as the men sit together in jail they hatch a plan for an elaborate diamond heist.\r The story is told in the past tense by one of the five men, Verbal Kint, as he sits across from a detective trying to uncover what happened during the attempted heist. This provides a unique twist in that not everything Kint describes is necessarily accurate or true and keeps the viewer constantly guessing as to the true nature of his involvement.\r Featuring a fantastic cast The Usual Suspects features a plethora of interesting and entertaining characters, none more so than Kint himself and by the time the movie reaches its fantastically clever finale most viewers will realise they have just watched a cinematic masterpiece.",

Everything has a low-budget, early Tarantino-esque feel, which is good for two reasons: First, the story and acting have to carry the movie and they do so superbly. Secondly, the aura of simplicity adds to the feel of realism: instead of special effects and sleekness, one gets to feel as if there, with the characters. Without spoiling too much, I can say that this is one of the cleverest movies I've ever seen. So many details add together in subtle ways, allowing the viewer to slowly but surely come to conclusions just seconds before the characters do too. It never feels forced or obvious, yet the director manages to guide us through a mental maze. Apart from Spacey who is sublime, I believe that Byrne and Palminteri both diserve lots of credit, even though Palminteri's character has little depth, the actor plays the role to it's full potential, secretly enabling the story to go the way it goes. Overall, it's not a movie everyone will find fantastic, but if you're into the criminal heroes / messing with your mind kind of thriller, boy, are you in for a ride.",

A more accurateAn ugly word that often gets unfairly tossed around in film criticism is manipulative. This word seems like sudden death for any movie, and is often used to describe a film that tries to play to the emotions of its audience. A more accurate way of using this term is a film that has little confidence in what it does and simply tries to throw things at the audience, hoping for validity. The Usual Suspects is a great example. While it certainly does paint an interesting picture, the characters are stock, and without interesting play between the players, it over compensates with plot twists and story holes, mixed rather uninspired interrogation scenes. There is little to enjoy in The Usual Suspects other than trying to put together its story, and once you do that you realize it is not even an interesting story, but simply feeds the audience so little, that there is little payoff to learning the surprises.",

I have to say it was more than a little disappointing. I do understand why people, including myself, have become so attached to this movie. Spacey's performance is fantastic, the reveal at the end of the film is still exciting and fun, and there are some very memorable, quotable lines. What I forgot about are some of the problems with this film, and they are numerous. First of all for a thriller this movie spends a whole lot of time with nothing going on. While most of the performances are ok, I still have no idea what they were doing with Del Toro's accent. The score is pretty poor. Once the final reveal happens there are countless plot holes that will never be explained. While I still like this movie based on the two strongest aspects of the film, and will probably revisit it again in a few years. I will not recommend this movie as strongly the next time it comes up with someone who has never seen it.",

I said I would probally watch it but it probally wouldn't be that great. I was very wrong. The Usual Suspects is about a group of criminals, each specified in a certain field, brought together by a legendary criminal to do some dirty work. This legend is named Keyser Soze. The only problem is, Keyser Soze might not be real. A lawyer named Kobayashi tells the five criminals about this job by Soze and they unwillingly accept. The whole movie is about one man that survived from that mission, Verbal(Kevin Spacey). Verbal is a crippled man who was the only survivor of the deadly mission. One cop wants a story from him about one of his partners that the cops suspects is more than an ordinary criminal, maybe even relations with Soze. This movie started off kind of slow which turned me off at first. The film then gradually started to pick up and gave me the best ending of a movie I have ever seen. Actually, the ending pumped my score up to 10. The acting in this movie is really good... there was a lot of suspense in this movie, especially toward the very end of it. This movie is on my top five favorite movies of all time. Rewatching it really makes you respect it more. My only big problem with this movie is they didn't develop a few characters very well.

First of all, hats off to Bryan Singer's outstanding direction, Christopher McQuarrie's confusing and thrilling screenplay and Kevin Spacey's remarkable and an Oscar-deserving performance which made the film too freaking awesome. I can't begin to appreciate the surprise Bryan Singer has managed to deliver to us. The mystery, the neo-noir elements, the puzzles and the way all the pieces are put together in the climax are just marvellous. I don't know why Roger Ebert found this movie confusing and gave it such a low rating (He did the same with Fight Club, starring Edward Norton and Brad Pitt). The plot is confusing, yes, but it's something really unusual and astounding and that's what makes this film so exciting. Although, the characterization is limited and there are a few possible plotholes as well. Those plotholes aren't explained properly but you can easily ignore them since they don't have anything to do with the real story. What I really like about this movie is that once you have started watching it, it will keep you interested. You might also find it difficult to follow the characters and the plot at some points but keep your mind and eyes open and you will be finally able to understand everything. Long story short, even with the limited characterization and confusing screenplay, The Usual Suspects is a classic and remarkable neo-noir thriller that you are definitely going to love and appreciate.

It’s a story of much complexity with a lot of dialogue. This, in combination with the big lack of character depth might seem like a big flaw, but the 3rd act explains a lot of this and it does weigh more than the film’s cons — for some people. I loved the ending but found most of the 1st and 2nd act slow and uneventful. The third act made the whole flick superbly better, mostly thanks to the film’s mysterious antagonist, the powerful direction by Bryan Singer and Kevin Spacey's performance as the character 'Verbal'. It’s one great and dramatic thriller, but that might be a bit too slow for my taste.Personal rating: 72/100Critical rating: 80/100",

Fully deserving of its reputation as one of the best modern, and perhaps overall, films ever made. Not everybody is going to disagree and that is fine.'The Usual Suspects' is slickly and audaciously made, filmed with a lot of style and is atmospherically directed. It is also hauntingly scored. It is intricately and intelligently written by Christopher McQuarrie, some of the best screen-writing he ever did. It is beautifully and deftly directed by Bryan Singer. If remembered correctly, neither McQuarrie or Singer were well known at the time and it was 'The Usual Suspects' that put them on the map.Film is famous for the iconic line-up scene, the noticeboard that haunts everybody forever and its killer twist, one for the ages and not one to forget in the long one. Twists have wildly varied in film, there are some ingenious ones but also some naff ones, 'The Usual Suspects' is one of the ingenious ones. 'The Usual Suspects' as said before doesn't just have its twist going for it. The flashback-packed story is similarly intricate and never feels muddled or convoluted.It has some of the finest ensemble acting there has ever been. This is especially true for a mesmerising Kevin Spacey in one of the most deserved Oscar Wins that year. Spacey is just one of the all round brilliant performances. Pete Postelthwaite, an always dependable actor who is still very much missed, is suitably mysterious, and Dan Hedaya and Chazz Palminteri make their mark as the confused cops. Steven Baldwin doesn't have a particularly challenging role but has never been better, Gabriel Byrne is also solid.Overall, magnificent film in every sense.

This movie follows on five usual suspects who are arrested for a trumped up charge on hijacked truck with guns. And wouldn't you know it? A mysterious crime lord who is Turkish named Keyser Söze which I will not give information about that character. One of my favourite scenes from this movie is when those five criminals get arrested they have to say the tagline they've been given called \"Hand me the keys, you f£$king c**ksucker.\" This is the memorable line in the entire film.Todd Hockney: \"Hand me the keys, you f£$king c**ksucker.\"Michael McManus: \"Give me the f£$king keys, you f£$king c**ksucker, motherf£$ker...\"Fred Fenster: \"Hand me the keys, you c**ksucker.\" Hand me the f£$king keys, you c**ksucker. What the f£$k?\"Dean Keaton: \"Hand me the keys, you f£$king c**ksucker.\"Verbal Kint: \"Hand me the keys, you f£$king c**ksucker.\"The characters what I get into is the one I love is The Usual Suspects and the only one I got into is Michael McManus played by Stephen Baldwin. Why is that? Well, he's hilariously cocky and smart mouthed and he says the tagline which I really love and I kinda laughed and chuckled at is my favourite line and that is, \"Give me the f£$king keys, you f£$king c**ksucker, motherf£$ker...\" and he does gets a good line. I guess the only factor here is that Kevin Spacey did a great performance as Verbal Kint and yes, he won an Oscar for that and he in the interrogation with Dave Kujan who asks Kint questions about Keyser Söze, the dope on the boat and Dean Keaton. I once watched it just to concentrate on Kevin's performance through the entire film. Well, of course everybody remembers the most is the ending. It really adds a twist that who is the real Keyser Söze and the fact that everyone believed it, it really is Keyser Söze. Okay, now this is an thrill ride experience of The Usual Suspects. Best film of the year hands down. Great writing, great directing, great pacing, great characters, great editing and one great twist ending. This is a fantastic film. I really enjoyed this.",

Not a horrible movie by any means, but gets way too much hype. The plot isn't very compelling and very confusing to follow at times, and the twist at the end doesn't pack the punch that it should. The film is partially saved by great actors, but I just wouldn't consider it a very good movie.",

Wonderful script. Great camera work. A true gem.With Kevin Spacey leading the pack in his Academy Award winning performance, the acting in this film is very believable, and powerful. Your eyes will be glued to the film from the moment it begins, to the moment when your jaw hits the floor, in the end.I would highly recommend this film to anyone and everyone who considers themselves a fan of movies. This is simply a must-see.",
