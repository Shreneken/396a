  "summary": "A family descended from Maori warriors is bedeviled by a violent father and the societal problems of being treated as outcasts.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The film's story is both culturally specific and broadly universal and that duality is a large part of what makes Once Were Warriors work.",
    "The director's key achievement is creating a convincing sense of daily life in the household and neighborhood. This is not a narrow drama that focuses on a few themes; it paints a whole style of life, the good times with the bad.",
    "Once Were Warriors works, to some degree, on three levels: the visceral, the emotional, and the intellectual, and it is the amalgamation of these that makes this a memorable film.",
    "Once Were Warriors has more to say than the traditional TV-movie about spousal abuse. But some viewers will have to pay a price: This is a movie that requires strength and fortitude to sit through.",
    "Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell, who plays Grace, had never acted before, and neither have a couple of the other key players. But under the careful direction of television veteran Lee Tamahori, they all do credible and forceful work.",
    "You can feel director Lee Tamahori doing his best to get a rise out of you. Yet his work has fire and substance, too.",
    "At once upsetting and highly involving, it packs an undeniable punch.",
    "A gritty human drama evoking the residual vibrancy of a threatened culture.",
    "There's a documentary-like realism to the movie, thanks to its authentic Maori cast and Tamahori's semi-improvisational approach to direction. Tamahori also gives everyone a sympathetic, realistic dimension.",
    "Pic deserves nurturing, because it’s one of the best to emerge from New Zealand in quite a while. Tamahori, working from Riwia Brown’s intelligent script, has done a marvelous job in depicting the day-to-day horror of the Heke family, which is held together only by its women, the sorely tried Beth and her eldest daughter, 16-year-old Grace.",
    "It's a fine, fierce and nearly unforgettable movie.",
    "You may not want to accept what you see here; you may be unable to accept it. But it's doubtful you'll leave this film unmoved.",
    "An uncompromising, emotionally draining drama that presents the urbanization of New Zealand's Maori as a cultural disaster, one that is mirrored in the shards of a shattering marriage. This explosive first film by director Lee Tamahori focuses on the transformation of a battered wife, but its story is fueled by the machismo of the disenfranchised Maori male.",
    "A movie that's lean, unsentimental and hard around the edges -- a gut- grabber that stays with you for days afterward.",
    "A grim, well-realized film from New Zealand. It is an impressive first feature for its director, Lee Tamahori, and a splendid dramatic vehicle for its stars, especially Rena Owen, who gives a gritty portrayal of a Maori woman fighting to stand her ground in a violent ghetto household.",
    "A brutally effective family drama. Rough around the edges and crudely obvious at times, it still presents a raw, disturbing story of domestic strife.",
    "Domestic violence has never been more savagely portrayed on screen.",
    "There's little new here, but uniformly powerful performances (especially Owen's) give the tale unexpected power and depth, and the exotic details--like the elaborate tribal tattoos worn by Nig's gang, or the Maori chants Boogie learns in reform school--make the Heke family's descent into misery seem fresher than it otherwise might."
