  "critic_reviews": [
    "Before Sunrise speaks as much to the mind as to the heart, and much of what it says is likely to strike a responsive chord -- a rare and special accomplishment for any motion picture.",
    "It's a lovely and wistful celebration of youth, time and moments of connection -- and about the experience of living in the midst of a simple, perfect day that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life.",
    "Before Sunrise is a film that first startles you with its simplicity, then bowls you over with its complexity.",
    "If Linklater goes to a bit of an extreme here, it's in making both characters so intelligent and sincere, so ardent and giving, that they seem a little too good to believe.",
    "Richard Linklater goes Hollywood (1995) -- triumphantly and with an overall intelligence, sweetness, and romantic simplicity that reminds me of wartime weepies like The Clock.",
    "Watching and listening to these two is a charming experience; their conversation has the ring of veracity, and rarely does the viewer's interest stray.",
    "Though Linklater allows the movie to wander, he never allows the pace to slacken, and more often than not he finds some unexpected bit of found poetry or cultural kitsch to make the digressions worthwhile.",
    "The overall effect is too intelligent to be soppy and too damn good to be ignored.",
    "The charm -- the midsummer enchantment -- never feels forced; it steals up and wins you. A true romance.",
    "Before Sunrise is so much like real life - like a documentary with an invisible camera - that I found myself remembering real conversations I had experienced with more or less the same words.",
    "Delpy and Hawke begin to grow on you and Linklater and his actors achieve a point midway through the film when the characters are so attractive and smart and emotionally daring that you'll be happy to spend the night with them.",
    "Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are attractive stars, but what's most appealing about the picture is the value it puts on sharing ideas and feelings through language.",
    "What Mr. Linklater does best here is to come up with conversational gambits that have just the right fancifulness to suit this situation.",
    "There's nothing much to the movie, except for the amiability of the actors and the layers of feeling Linklater provides, but that's just almost enough.",
    "The weight of the film rests on the shoulders of Hawke and Delpy, and they're both remarkable.",
    "Sunrise feels more like an absorbing experiment than a supple success.",
    "If his first two films were about emotional mutes, then Before Sunrise is the tale of two kids who won't shut the hell up.",
    "While pic remains sympathetic and appealing, the endless dialogue and repetitive settings become wearing through the couple's one long night together, and the artifice of the premise may contribute to the difficulty the film has in coming to romantic life."

But, as usual, I went into it with a very open mind and found I was quite pleasantly surprised. I don’t know it was because the film touched those parts of the human psyche that relate to the interaction of the sexes; but I did find their conversations quite enthralling at times whilst at the same time quite entertaining. I guess it’s like eavesdropping on a conversation, you know it’s wrong but you just can’t help it. I thought it was well made, using Vienna very well without becoming a kind of travelogue.

They meet on a train just outside Vienna; by the time they reach the station, they've hit it off well enough for Jesse to propose that Céline spend the next 14 hours wandering the city with him, until his flight leaves for the States. Intrigued, she accepts. So begins an unexpected adventure of the heart. What's magical about Linklater's entrancing movie is the way he and his actors manage to convey the emotional truths that underlie all the talk as the potential lovers test each other's opinions and commitment. Funny, poignant and perceptive, this is a brilliant gem.",

Yes at times, but the script by Richard Linklater and Kim Krizan is thought-provoking, and engaging, make twist and turns when you don’t expect it to be. Linklater and Krizan create these characters that are spellbinding, Hawke and Delpy bring so much elegance into their characters that’s awe-inspiring also beyond spectacular. On his way to Vienna, an American named Jesse (Ethan Hawke) meets Celine (Julie Delpy), a student returning to Paris. After a prolonged conversations a connection starts between them, Jesse convinces Celine to get of the train with him in Vienna and start a journey. Jesse’s flight doesn’t depart till tomorrow, so he has no money for lodging. They wander off in the city sharing experiences with one and another. As the night progresses so does their bond for each other. The performances are a tour de force under the direction Linklater and this is Richard Linklater’s magnum opus. Linklater creates a tremendous atmosphere which the second reason why the film is so perfect, and has the perfect tone to it. As soon as the film ends you can’t get enough of these characters, they're so interesting and irresistible, but after you watch the next one. Grade A+",

A film that isWorthy of the acclaim it has received over the years, Before Sunrise is a beautiful film that oozes with romance and works in brilliantly some comedic elements throughout that only add to the natural feeling of the film. A film that is essentially just a \"day in a life\" featuring two characters who simply run into each other and decide to spend the next day together, it is one that many will complain about \"nothing happening\", yet that is its brilliance. It is simply a film about a chance encounter between two people with a major connection between them. What ensues is one of the best romantic films ever made with phenomenal writing (seriously, some of the dialogue here is perfection), great direction from Richard Linklater, and terrific acting from Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Both leads turn in very natural performances that fit in perfectly with the feel this one gives. Honestly, it feels like a documentary about two people who actually fell in love in Vienna. The film is also exquisitely shot, which is quite appropriate since the film as a whole is beautiful. Overall, Before Sunrise is a great film that will continue to stand tall for a long, long time to come.",

However, the(skip to the last paragraph for a concise one-sentence summary and a number)\rBefore Sunrise is a film that is magical in a unique way; it talks with the viewer. That said, the film does not literally converse with the audience. However, the way the film progresses and the conversations held by the protagonists make us feel like a comfortable third wheel. It’s like we’re walking along by our protagonists (and director Richard Linklater, since he has spilled so much uch of his persona and soul into this artistic venture it feels like we already know him) through Vienna.\rAnother highlight of this film is the powerful chemistry that the protagonists share. It’s as if there is an innate connection between the two that has just now been discovered like siblings separated at birth (although not quite for romantic reasons). Their spontaneity and inquisitive, skeptical approach towards life and people clicks like a lock. This pitch-perfect compatibility motivates the film and makes for a very moving conclusion as time runs out before sunrise.\rThe film is very talkative, I will not deny that. At some points, it also lingers as the conversations drift into simple chatter and the plotline seems to have no clear direction. However, no moment in the film is wasted, as every conversation further develops each character's personality as well as their sweet relationship.\rIn conclusion, this is what I have to say: Before Sunrise is a magical and enlightening gift to anyone who views it and has enough patience to make it through the dragging conversations between its lovers. Before you know it, the film will be talking to you more loudly than the protagonists talk to each other.\r FINAL SCORE: 82.5 (excitingly great -----o--------------- almost perfect)",

We all remember the feeling of first big talking with the person you like. You talk a lot, they talk a lot, suddenly butterflies appear in the stomach, you are excited, take and be careful for every word from your interlocutor. Due to the shortness of this feeling, the film takes you to the same atmosphere and helps you to remember. I would say some movies submit a peculiar way of experiencing some strong feelings again - naive, but works. Before Sunrise is included in the list of these movies. Acting was just as great as possible, they where acting shy, confused, but also happy.Also the varied script contributed for the whole authentic atmosphere. Maybe more music, sounds and maybe drama.. would have made the movie 10/10.With that in mind, highly recommend it!",

An American Male meets a French Female on a train and asks her to spend the evening with him in Vienna. What is not simplistic is the wonderful characters, and exceptional dialogue in Linklater's film. It is obvious that Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy) have a connection after their first conversation. As their day progresses their connection to each other deepens as does our connection with them. Before Sunrise is so special because we are not manipulated into connecting with them through tragedy, or violence, or sex. We connect with them as we do with people in everyday life, through the life experiences they share with us little by little as our relationship grows. This is true intimacy and is beautifully achieved here.\r The intimate, personal moments that Jesse and Celine share throughout the film are sprinkled amidst a plethora of other conversations during their night together. They discuss everything from palm reading to dancing, the conversation is never boring and never unnecessary. They don't agree on everything and through that disagreement we we are invited further into their personalities as their connection grows. Jesse and Celine do interact with other characters in the course of the film. Linklater perfectly blends these interactions as well. The supporting characters add to the film without over powering the main characters. These characters are also just odd enough to further strengthen Jesse and Celine's connection as kindred spirits, without ever becoming caricatures.\r Before Sunrise is a beautiful film. It made me want to rush off to Europe and spend aimless evenings wandering around foreign cities looking for romance. I suppose I will have to settle for revisiting this film and these characters in the future.",

Why is this the best film of allBefore watching this film I had always regarded The Godfather as my favorite film of all time. Since then, every film I have watched has not met the bar which had been set so very high… until Before Sunrise. Why is this the best film of all time? Because you will struggle to find another film like it. The plot is so straightforward; a boy is on a train to catch a flight which will head him back to America alongside a girl on the same train who is travelling back to France. They both meet in conversation and together, decide to spend the next 24 hours within the beautiful and gorgeous city of Vienna. Sounds like an easy and simple plot but what makes this film so enthralling and interesting is what happens in Vienna and the thoughts and feelings expressed by the two lead characters, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy who portray such outstanding and realistic performances which make you forget that they are just acting. This is a film which consists heavily of pure dialogue which may put off some people; however that is the beauty of the film. There are no explosions, car chases or action scenes but simply two people exploring each other inside a wonderful city debating about such topics such as Reincarnation, Death, Love and many more. The conversations are so real, so vivid and so dreamlike that it makes the film it own. It's almost as though they are in an alternate reality where their normal routine life is put to a hold and they escape inside a dream world. Towards the end where the night is over and the sun has risen, Ethan Hawke's character Jesse quotes that they have gone back into \"real time\" which shows that the moments they have shared and the collection of memories that they have made, are those which will last forever in their own little world and time. A classical romance which does well to stray away from the old cheesy and clichéd films of that genre, Before Sunrise is superbly filmed and wonderfully acted with rich, pure and realistic dialogue making it one of those rare films that shine with magnificence, a film that everyone has to see.",

It's a story about two strangers who meet on a train, talk about their lives a little bit, fall in love with each other and then spend the remaining time simply talking to each other to pass the night as Jesse has to catch a flight the next day. Exploring the city, they do plain talking, sometimes raising deep philosophical questions. What really amazed me was that despite all that plainness, Linklater really got me to watch through the entire movie- I never really got bored. I believe that it mostly owes to the strong narrative technique that he adopts and the dope acting performances full with energy put up by both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. I think this movie is definitely worth a watch if you are willing to hear some stories and are lonely or something.",

The story focuses on two young people who are tempted by the experience of knowing more about each other. The romance is nice and developed in an interesting way, without forcing any feelings nor overdoing it. Characters are endearing, with some few (but notable) highs and lows according to me and the ending (no spoil) remains intriguing even if really predictable. It definitely make me want to see the sequel.However it is impossible to keep the count of the movies based on such a story. The introduction is just based on a too simple hook like 'I don't know you but already like you a lot, would you give me my chance?'. Obviously if she answers 'no' there is no movie. Obviously if the feelings don't manage to grow there is no sequel, no proper ending. Fortunately, the film seems to be aware of its shortcomings and takes the gamble of proposing an innovative visual approach. Throughout the film, we simply follow the two characters, there are very few other speakers. It's a shame that this interesting idea quickly became too repetitive to the point that I sometimes felt like I was suffocating by the forced solitude of these two people. In their own originality these scenes in which they are walking side by side become boring and overrepresented. In addition, I found it hard to empathize with Celine (Julie Delpy) because she often seemed calculating and inauthentic. When she tries to sound self-assured or when she tries to utter aphorisms, it very often falls apart in disjointed pieces. In his side Jesse (Ethan Hawk) totally is in his element and even during embarrassing moments. I found that his acting was particularly amazing.The fact that the film constantly tries to be philosophical and profound while unfortunately ending up being more childish and ineffective than anything else made me lower the score. In conclusion, the lighting, the originality, the unpredictability of the dialogues and the overall acting clearly saved 'Before Sunrise' from being another traditional and boring love movie.",

Given the American character is in Europe, I suppose I could compare aspects of the plot (thematically) to Lost in Translation, which is another great film about feeling somewhat lost and lonely. I wouldn't say the two main characters in this film are expressly lonely per se but there did feel (to me) to be that element of isolation and companionship of course. It is somewhat philosophical in tone - a somewhat deep film, moreso than a lot of the not so memorable romantic comedies. There are discussions about death, dreams and religion and the characters share some of their secrets.Would I recommend it? definitely. It gets two thumbs up from me, although if your not at all keen on gentle, slow films (plot pace wise) or romance type watches then this may not appeal to you.",

It's a rich film unique only to certain filmmakers, such as Louis Malle with a simple but artistic vibe and insistence on a theatrical presentation of dialogue, character and subtext in the mise-en-scene.Watching this as part of a trilogy and with an audience, the reaction was sublime, i felt i was among friends at a party, we all laughed throughout and I know I shed a few tears, perhaps at grieving the aching innocence of youth's love that I've lost, maybe at the purity of the characters and the bittersweetness of never seeing someone that you have a connection with ever again. Despite the fact that they did meet again (in Before Sunset), real life rarely gives us this.It's a passionate and honest film with many hands of the same minds and the same love poured in to it. Every little flourish fleshes out a film brimming with life, perfect male-female observation and a timeless quality to the best meet cute film ever. I have previously rated all films in this series at variable levels but all at once they are, like LOTR trilogy, one perfect 10/10 film.",
