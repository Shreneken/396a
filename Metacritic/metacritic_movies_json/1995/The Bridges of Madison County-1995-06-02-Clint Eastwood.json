    "critic_reviews": [
        "Streep is an actress known for her uncanny ability with accents, but her quiet performance in \"Bridges\" proves that she would have made a world-class silent-film star, too.",
        "To say that Eastwood, who directed, has done a first-rate job of adaptation fails to do him justice. What he's brought off is closer to alchemy.",
        "It is easy to analyze the mechanism, but more difficult to explain why this film is so deeply moving.",
        "A beautiful film, not only in the way it was photographed, but for the manner through which the characters are revealed to us.",
        "The strength of Eastwood\u2019s Bridges is in its patience, and how it lets the love story develop from start to finish, even though the audience knows from the beginning the broad strokes of what\u2019s going to happen.",
        "Limited by the vapidity of this material while he trims its excesses with the requisite machete, Mr. Eastwood locates a moving, elegiac love story at the heart of Mr. Waller's self-congratulatory overkill.",
        "Streep and Eastwood's chemistry makes the film.",
        "Bridges is another example of Eastwood's remarkable economy of style as both a director and an actor. It is neither his best work nor his worst, though it is a fascinating exploration.",
        "Clint Eastwood transcends the story's cliches with a classically restrained yet steadily imaginative filmmaking style.",
        "Robert Waller's inexplicably colossal bestseller is transferred to the screen with more art than it deserves, but neither old-fashioned Hollywood craftsmanship nor the massive star power of Eastwood and Streep can compensate for the story's intellectual slightness and emotional implausibility.",
        "Given the intelligent restraint of the treatment, this is about as fine an adaptation of this material as one could hope for, although there is still something of a gap between the impressive skill of the filmmaking and the ultimately irredeemable aspects of the source.",
        "The reason for the film's success is simple. Screenwriter Richard LaGravenese and director Eastwood skirt most of novelist Robert James Waller's excesses.",
        "What Eastwood and Streep have done is to bring a semblance of emotional reality to the story.",
        "Screenwriter Richard LaGravenese and director Clint Eastwood have turned out something sombre and restrained -- almost, in fact, good (though it's too long).",
        "Through the actress's effort and her director's generosity, this book about an irresistible man becomes a movie about a remarkable woman. Madison County is Eastwood's gift to women.",
        "The film version, competently directed by Clint Eastwood and beautifully acted by Meryl Streep, isn't about to mess with a popular formula - this is a straight-up adaptation as faithful as a fawning spouse.",
        "While this adaptation of Waller's treacly bodice-ripper leaves out a lot of the lurid excess, it is not altogether free of pomposity.",
        "LaGravenese...  has understood that the worst of Bridges is not in its dialogue but in the silent musings that occupy its characters' minds. By keeping those thoughts unspoken, by allowing the camera to show instead of having words tell, much has been accomplished.",
        "Even those who despised the original novel should not have trouble stomaching Bridges, while the novel's fans will find the film -- despite some additions -- generally true to what they perceive to be the book's spirit.",
        "Director Eastwood favors naturalism and sometimes the effort to reproduce what it is like to meet someone new bogs the picture down irreparably.",
        "Clint Eastwood resurrects the star system, the Hollywood love story, and middle-aged romance, but despite all his craft and sincerity, he and screenwriter Richard LaGravenese can't quite turn Robert James Waller's cardboard best-seller into flesh and bone."

The chemistry between the lead cast is the primary reason why there is such pulsating energy emitting from this electrifying tale. The crisp and the uneasiness is bred, without any flirty talks and the way it surfs around the edgy with a shady note, is stupendously breathtaking. The attraction depicted in here plays a vital role and the makers being aware of the strength of the cast, milks it out from them that lures the viewers in, in its innocent bubble. The background score is mesmerizing, the cinematography is pure magic with fine editing and well detailed camera work. Contrary to premise where it suggests it has a limited span to be spent upon, the feature is maturely calm and soothing where eschewing their characters appropriately, the actors cast in their spells in a subtle tone. The narration is adaptive, elaborative and exquisite with gripping screenplay and pragmatic conversations. Sculpted to communicate for subsequent generation, the tale speaks volume metaphorically in those calm silent pitches that is harrowing and heartwarming at the same time. Streep is a revelation in her convoluted and unsure portrayal that is probably one of her best and underrated performance and on the other hand Eastwood is poised and reserved, supporting her thoroughly in each aspect.LaGravanese's exquisite adaptation gets better execution than anticipated from Eastwood's deck and is probably his finest act. The poem that flows fluently across the entire feature, a stunningly beautiful tale and stellar performances at the heart of it are the high points of the feature. The Bridges Of Madison County is a rare art where its poignancy is naturally cathartic for its innocence foliated through chivalrous allegory.",

Though it is possible that Eastwood did not take inspiration from Lean's film, theAfter watching David Lean's brilliant film Brief Encounter yesterday, it seems like fate that I would encounter Clint Eastwood's The Bridges of Madison County. Though it is possible that Eastwood did not take inspiration from Lean's film, the two are incredibly similar thematically and plot-wise. Portraying two people meeting for a fleeting few days in 1965, this film is a transcendent look at love and denial that is positively heart wrenching. Set in both 1965 and the present day, the film looks at the affair between Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep) and Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) as it occurs and as it is viewed by Francesca's two children as they learn about it after their mother's death. Both a passionate and mournful look at love, the film is a brilliantly constructed look at relationships.In 1965, Francesca is an unhappy housewife. With her husband and children out of town for a few days, she plans on just getting some time away from them and breathing. However, photographer Robert Kincaid comes to town to take pictures of the bridges of her Iowa hometown for a National Geographic spread. Quickly falling for him, their relationship is brief, just four days, but very much akin to the one in Brief Encounter. Robert is not married to a woman, but is married to his work. Taking him all over the world, he is devoted to the world to the detriment of his relationships with women. Francesca, meanwhile, ditched her dreams long ago to have children. The part of her that would jump and leave at the drop of a hat is long gone, for fear of instilling a bad message to her children. Thus, both know their relationship is doomed. It will end because there are forces beyond their control that pull them away from one another. Yet, as much as it hurts them both, neither wish to forget what they felt over the course of those four days as they, by their own admission, cram a lifetime of passion into just four days.With the relationship defined in small moments - Robert picking her flowers, dancing in the kitchen, taking photos at the bridge, laying in the bathtub, and simply talking at the table - the romance is incredibly authentic. Yet, no moment really rips your heart out akin to the last chance they have to be together in spirit. With her husband Richard (Jim Haynie) home now, Francesca goes into town with him where she sees Robert. Staring at one another in the rain, the film refuses to go for the overly dramatic and unrealistic conclusion. They look at one another, Francesca leans over in the front seat to get a better look at him in the pouring rain, but they go their separate ways. Leaving town, Richard winds up behind Robert. In his truck, Robert can be seen hanging the crucifix Francesca gave him on his rearview mirror and waiting at a green light. He gives her one last chance to come with him. She clutches the door handle and waits. Her worries about Robert no longer wanting her are long gone. The connection is mutual. The experience unique. They are brief soulmates, but Francesca must choose: her family or Robert. In this tense and dramatic scene, the drama feels real. It is not manufactured and you can feel her dilemma. Regardless of what she chooses, she will never feel complete as her heart is guaranteed to be pulled in two separate directions. As is the case throughout, Streep beautifully portrays this complex character and the dilemmas before her. She acts out at Robert for making her feel this way, is set to leave, and is set to stay. She cannot make up her mind, but settles on hurting the least amount of people. Were it not for Streep's powerful performance, the film would still be good but not great. This is the perfect marriage between actor and material as she brings power and grace to the picture, as well as the dilemmas put before her character.One of the film's greatest assets, however, is the portrayal of Francesca's husband. Often times in these films about affairs, the spouse is shown to be boring or abusive or any number of things. Robert, however, is not treated in such a way. He is a great husband and father. On his death bed, he expresses his regret that he never gave Francesca her dreams. His role in the film is moving and powerfully written. A large part of why Francesca stays is to not hurt Richard and it is easy to see why. He is a beautiful soul who never hurt anybody. Why would he deserve to be hurt in such a way by his wife, who he never wronged. Thus, by not portraying him negatively, The Bridges of Madison County brilliantly shows the pull her marriage has on her heart. Had he been portrayed negatively, it would be a mystery as to why she would stay when she was so unhappy. But, due to his characterization, it becomes clear that she stayed because she loved him. She could not hurt somebody she loved for the simple reason that he was not her soulmate. It is a truly selfless act and yet another example of her giving up her dreams for her family.",

It is one of my top 10 favorite movies! always will be a fan of Clint as well as Streep! such an amazing love story that will make you want more and more. To think about the story, and try to see it as a ''real life'' synario, I can honestly say that it would be really creepy if a random bridge photographer stopped at my place and ask for directions in a remote small farming town. But its fiction, so there for I absolutely love it and I will watch this repeatedly through out my life while teaching the children to never trust anyone who says they're lost even though they new what their profession entailed.",
