    "Offeris an exhilarating, and occasionally touching, experience that has viewers leaving the theater caught up in an afterglow of wonder. These days, heros like William Wallace are as rare as motion picture displays of this high, uncompromising quality.",
    "One of the most spectacular entertainments in years.",
    "Tempers moments of despair with deliriously romantic passages abetted by James Horner's traditionally lush score and photography by John Toll (\"Legends of the Fall's\" Oscar winner).",
    "Thrilling, a grand cinematic adventure -- beautifully handled myth-making from Gibson, who, by the way, is just fine in the lead.",
    "An action epic with the spirit of the Hollywood swordplay classics and the grungy ferocity of \"The Road Warrior.\"",
    "Looks like a true epic...even if it is both bloody and bloody long.",
    "The sort of massive vanity piece that would be easy to disparage if it didn't essentially deliver.",
    "Despite a formidable effort and occasional grace, there's something cowardly about Braveheart -- it's an aspiring giant with a diminutive soul.",
    "A completely adequate modern facsimile of the classic romantic epic.",
    "Braveheart features some of the most enthralling combat sequences in years, and the excessive ferocity of the violence is part of the thrill.",
    "Never tries to confuse our loyalties or question the strategies of our hero or bring home the all-embracing soul-destroying horrors of war for all sides. Braveheart may be rip-roaring, but it isn't all that brave.",
    "A massive, sweaty, frequently silly epic that nevertheless delivers enough brute pleasure to pass a rainy afternoon.",
    "Braveheart comes up short by beating the drums of human treachery and violence so loudly they become assaults.",
    "Braveheart is too much, too late.",
    "A rambling disappointment."

It is the story of William Wallace (and with that also Robert the Bruce) in one of the most interesting and celebrated times in Scottish history. It is a battle for independence from England with schemes and lot of struggles. It is a nice Hollywood version with passion, emotion and glory. It is one of the most immersive movies of its time and deserved its praise by fans and critics. The real story behind it is not as black and white or glorious. It is from a historical standpoint really incorrect and awful (The list of errors would be longer than a summary of the movie). This does however not influence my rating as entertainment and documentation are separate genres. For itself it was Mel Gibson grand project as he was director, writer, producer and main actor. You can always feel the passion, heart and soul that was injected into this project. It uses clever techniques to build up the characters and story. Lets start with the actors. Mel Gibson is a great William Wallace and delivers a remarkable performance. Angus MacFadyen is a strong Robert the Bruce who struggles with his crown. Patrick McGoham as Edward I (Longshanks) is a magnificent bastard and one of the best villains I have seen. I shorten my praise here and say all actors deliver a good to great performance. Then there are the beautiful sets and locations in the movie. They filmed in Scotland and Ireland and it looks awesome. On a sidenote there are holiday trips for Scottish movie locations as many movies made them popular. Then there are the battles. They are intense, immersive and you always feel excited. The story and characters together create a great atmosphere. Also there is some good humor in the movie. While I have no complaints in general I think that the ending can be a bit of a downer. Overall this is an excellent movie that pushes all the right buttons. It rightfully deserves the Oscars and acclaim. It is a must see except for history buffs or historians.",

Even though well over two decades have passed but everything from the film's battle scenes to the soundtrack are fresh in my memory. Braveheart builds slowly to its first gritty climax. Much of the early film concentrates on Wallace's love for Murron. Their courtship is unhurried, yet this is all preparation. The real meat of the story, which includes political betrayal, and dramatic battles, is yet to come. Braveheart is a brutal, bloody motion picture, but the violence is not gratuitous. The maiming, decapitations, and other assorted gruesome details make Wallace's world seem real and immediate. It is a testimony to the directorial skills of Mel Gibson that despite being three hours long this film never drags, in fact we the audience are transfixed. Braveheart is one of the best epics ever filmed and people would be talking about this movie fifty years from now.(Gibson's masterpiece).",

In the late 1200 a boy named William Wallace was born. After the English takes his land kills his brother, father, and wife he begins a revolt. This revolution ends up taking on epic proportions. The reason this revolution becomes so powerful is mainly because of William Wallace. He just is a motivational leader and his undying belief in freedom is contagious. In fact before one of the bigger battles of the movie Wallace makes the quote, “Sure I’d love to settle down, have a farm, and raise a family. But I can’t do any of that, not without the English taking it. I’m willing to lay down my life for others so that they may live the dream that I have. ” It was his belief in freedom and a land of their own that helps him lead his troops so well.\rNot only is the plot amazing, but the actors who preform it are truly stunning. Throughout the movie you can feel it, as Mel Gibson (William Wallace) yearns for a better life.  Every time Wallace loses someone you care about you can feel the pain in your heart too. Also when Wallace was betrayed to the English you felt everything in you die a little bit. This movie and the actors within it really help you respect and treasure the freedom we have now. It was because of great men like William Wallace that anyone has any true freedom.\rThe impact of this movie is incredible. I can guarantee that anyone who sees this movie will have a hard time not screaming freedom randomly. Personally I felt that all the themes of this movie were life changing, and impacted the way I’ll think of day to day life forever. In my opinion the only place this movie fell short was it wasn’t long enough. I would advise anyone who wants to live life to its fullest to watch this movie.\r-Patrick Brooks",

Every audience member has a different set of criteria they use to measure their viewing experience. Not everyone shares the same set of criteria. If we did, what a bland and uninspired world this would be.\r What I Personally Liked About \"Braveheart\":\rLet's start off by addressing the fact that this film features some of the most spectacular locations ever caught on camera. The shooting locations found in both Scotland and Ireland fit the production perfectly and breathed life into the backdrop in a way most movies can only dream about. The stylish way the locations are presented from a visual standpoint seems highly influenced by the eighties' output of Akira Kurosawa, and let's be honest, there are certainly worse directors you could derive inspiration from. As for the acting, Mel Gibson has fairly decent chemistry with all of the cast members he plays off. This is an admirable trait considering the fact that the spotlight is on him so often in this film. Unlike other three hour ensemble pieces from the nineties (\"Short Cuts,\" \"Magnolia,\" etc.), \"Braveheart\" contains a straightforward narrative and much of that is fueled by Gibson alone. In addition, the battle sequences are well-framed and well-choreographed which creates an exciting sense of urgent realism. It also contains one of the finest, most memorable battle cries of its decade when William Wallace says \"They may take our lives, but they'll never take...our freedom!\"\r What I Personally Disliked About \"Braveheart\":\rFor as good an actor as Gibson is, this film would have benefitted from tighter direction. You can feel every ounce of weight in its length and that is not a complimentary statement. Often times, it moves at a snail's pace with patches that serve to bore the story into one's head instead of letting the moments unfold naturally. Basically, it is an epic for the sake of being an epic. Another drawback is that many of the movie's villains feel like generic knock-offs when compared to the fully fleshed heroes who oppose them. From a cinematic standpoint, as we have learned over the decades, a hero is only as strong and as righteous as his villain is evil and crafty. The forgettable villains in this film inadvertently weaken the accomplishments of our brave Scots.\r My Overall Impression of \"Braveheart\":\rWhile it is a bit long in the tooth and a bit one-sided in the characterization department, this is still a reasonable example of what Mel Gibson was capable of delivering when he wasn't portraying crazed cops or reimagined mavericks. This is his show all the way and you can tell he tried to make the best of it.",

That's in large part due to Mel Gibson's remarkable and risk-taking direction, and the masterful editing.Long shots, wide camera angles, and quick cuts in the dialogue scenes as well as the battle sequences gave this movie a lively atmosphere, and therefore made it a unique experience that helped it to stand out from the other historical epic movies.That being said, I found the tonal shifts completely outputting. The movie kept moving from a somber to a lighter tone throughout its runtime to match the current situations and events. That made some important moments have less impact on me, such as; some dramatic moments didn't work as mush as it should, the climax of the plot felt sudden and not well prepared for it, etc. While it didn't take me a long time to adapt to the new tone, the episodic nature of the movie is quite annoying and distracting.The romantic relationship between Wallace and his wife was pretty fine and acceptable at first, but then it overstayed its welcome a little bit. Whilst the reason for that is quite understandable, I couldn't help but cringe for a while.The villain is very menacing and almost everything about him is great, except that he provided us with an exposition of his plans many times. But, fortunately, likewise some cheesy lines, these scenes were justified by Gibson's excellent direction that gave them an epic sense, and therefore made them more passable.Randall Wallace's screenplay is more than enough to make the movie match its ambition. From the way we witness our protagonist from his childhood to become the hero he is, to the miraculous narrative control on the abundance of side characters and their sub-plots. All that made Braveheart a larger-than-life historical tale, and I don't care about how historically accurate it is because it's a great movie!(8/10)",

The acting is good throughout, the action is very exciting and well done, the score is great, and the cinematography is gorgeous.

The length is also very much justified as there is always enough going on to keep you fully wrapped up in the proceedings. However, even though all of those things are good to great, there is enough going wrong to take away from the overall product. Firstly, the violence, though not graphic, is entirely numbing. There is just too much of it and by the end, it loses all of its impact as you are so desensitized to it. Also, I just struggled as times with Mel Gibson here. He just does not look right, he just seems so out of place here. His acting was good and all, but I think somebody else could have fit the look better. Finally, the historical inaccuracies are bad. This is not inaccurate like a film like Inglourious Basterds is inaccurate, as that one has no false pretense of accuracy and is very much theatrical and gloriously inaccurate. Here, Braveheart does not necessarily pass itself off as accurate, but it certainly would like you to believe that it is and I simply cannot do so. If it was only a little inaccurate, then ok, but the blatant disregard for what happens is annoying to say the least. Overall, Braveheart is a pretty good film and is certainly worth a watch.",

This story was writen by Randall Wallace and directed by Mel Gibson who also plays the main character, William Wallace, in this story. William experiences tragedy at a young age when he walks into a house filled with murrdered Scottish nobles, killed by King Henry Longshanks (played by Patrick McGoohan). Then again when his family is kill while trying to confront the king, and once again when he was an adult his family was taken away after the English try to rape his wife and then sentence her to death for assaulting a Brtish soldier. This infuriates Wallace and makes him seek revenge on the English through a crusade if violence and warfare. He is detrimental to this story because without Wallace the Scottish revolution would have never happened. I empathize deeply with Wallace and his loss he loses his family twice to a king he never pledged as his own. The main theme of the story is the idea freedom, you will probably hear him say that word more times than you can count throughout the movie. The theme of freedom in the movie helps drive Wallace to his goals and it was pulled off rather nicely, Gibson's performance makes the audience wish that they could do something in the world to stop opreshion of anyone. Gibson took a very dramatic approach to filming this movie with amazing battle sceenes and intense, dramatic diolage. The big impact this movie has on the world is to help people believe that one man can change the world and the importance of equality. As a person of Celtic ansestory I may have a bias but I truly believe that this movie inspires everyone who watches it to go out and make a difference in the world and try to others around them. I enjoyed this movie for it's raw story telling, everything felt natural and realistic nothing was forced onto the audience or was compleatly unbelievable.",

Directed by Mel Gibson (who also plays the lead role), has Randall Wallace's script.This film is especially dedicated to those who don't know absolutely nothing of Scotland's history and don't wish to understand anything about it anytime soon. This is because the whole film is a complete nonsense, one slapstick that should never have been filmed, an insult to Scotland and its past. Why am I so hard? Because this film not only ignored the real life of William Wallace, lying about that and inventing the most of things, but also portrays the Scots (and even the English) in a historically inaccurate manner.There is absolutely nothing good in this movie. The costumes don't match (even the kilts didn't exist yet at Wallace's time), battles didn't happened that way, Gibson's performance was poor and theatrical, photography is boring and ordinary and the psychological depth of all characters is comparable to a dry river in Summer. Oscars for this film? Yes, he got some (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects and Best Makeup)... but I don't even want to know how it's happened! Even the Razzie Awards are something too good for this movie. Mel Gibson is usually a good actor. He can be a good \"Patriot\", he may even know \"What Women Want\", have a \"Lethal Weapon\" or even several. I don't care. But making a \"Braveheart\" so bad that even the Monty Python would easily do better is such a shame that leaves me in the \"Edge of Darkness\"...

I say that as a Scottish person born and bred, who was in secondary school when this film was released and I clearly remember the criticism it got (I wasn't keen on historical films at the time). I can certainly understand the criticism - I admit one of my first thoughts on watching the start of this film was 'ugh, the accents are all wrong! their slaughtering our language, never mind the bloody violence(!)'. There are some good special effects and the battle scenes are undeniably somewhat intense - fairly gripping I guess but I would say it did feel a bit unnecessarily over the top. I realise how this will sound and I realise such battles were undoubtedly brutal and gory but the way its depicted, how and when cameras focus on certain injuries, it just felt slightly over the top. I'm ok with  most horror films too but obviously this is a film supposedly, if but loosely, based on fact and my initial reaction was that the most intense violent scenes felt somehow a little exploitative perhaps? I'm not sure. On the other hand, I felt it was a little too uncomfortably sentimental at the start. So, yes, this is a bit of a somewhat cheesy film of extremes but I can't say I entirely hated watching it, so I can't give it too low a rate, nor too high one.Also there's an issue with realism or accuracy in as much as the main character (and most others) having apparently bright shiny (very clean) teeth and so on, which surely wouldn't have been the case. Its a little thing but I thought it was quite noticeable. Plus, going back to the battle scenes, I also thought it was surprising how little blood appeared to have been spilled on the land, following said  battles, when we're shown people leaving the area...it just didn't seem entirely, well, credible and that's ignoring the whole elephant in the room of an Australian being Scottish(!).If your interested in this in terms of an entertaining watch of a film then yes, I'd cautiously recommend it - its certainly far from perfect but it is still reasonably gripping. I suppose I wouldn't especially recommend it in terms of being fully historically accurate, no but thats not all that matters in a film.",

Mel GibsonBraveheart: Well that was unexpected. Mel Gibson has a way with film making because I’ve only seen 2 of his movies and somehow they make you not like the films when you watch them but when you finish you end up really enjoying it. Mel Gibson brings his all in the lead with the Scottish accent to go along with it he did a great job. So did the rest of the cast and just like the Rambo movies they really make you hate the bad guys and of course there from England but they do it in the best way some people you may think are good but then flip it on your head and betray their people. The cinematography of the movie is great the Scotland lands have never looked so good its so well lit and very beautiful to look at. But the main thing I love so much is the music. All the music in this movie even though they over use some of the same songs it doesn’t matter at all the bagpipes sounds so good that I now want to go to Scotland, go to a music festival there and hear the music I adore it. But there are some bad things like the main motive is cliche fall in love, get married, girl dies, go fight but the real story is great Scotland fighting for there freedom. Then even though this came out before Passion of the Christ if you watched that movie first then you can see the same stuff he did like having the main character’s family watching him get tortured and then someone from his past walks past the family so maybe you can say that was a Braveheart shot but since I saw Passion first I called it a Passion shot. Overall yeah it was really good action was solid, blood was good, story nice but sometimes generic watching it during these times. Next review is Parasite though let’s see if it deserves its 5 Oscars.",
