  "critic_reviews": [
    "Scorsese tells his story with the energy and pacing he's famous for, and with a wealth of little details that feel just right.",
    "Possesses a stylistic boldness and verisimilitude that is virtually matchless.",
    "Whether or not Casino meets your expectations, it delivers the rush you only get from an audacious gamble.",
    "Several flaws, mostly minor, keep Casino on a plateau slightly below that of the director's best (Mean Streets, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas).",
    "A 2-hour classic wrongfully stretched into three.",
    "So long as Casino stays focused on the excesses -- of language, of violence, of ambition -- in the life-styles of the rich and infamous, it remains a smart, knowing, if often repetitive, spectacle.",
    "Visually impressive, splendidly performed, thematically significant, this is a movie in full possession of every key cinematic asset except one -- a solid script. Casino is a polished vehicle with an untuned engine.",
    "Simultaneously quite watchable and passionless.",
    "One of the ironies of Casino is that even though Scorsese is interested in the story's wider implications, he focuses so much energy on that unsavory romantic triangle that he and the film lose sight of the larger issues.",
    "As anthropology, it's fascinating, and everything about the production is first class. But the human drama at the heart of this movie is stillborn.",
    "An accomplished film that carries with it the unshakable feeling that we've seen it all before.",
    "It's an ambitious film -- but also a scattered, unfocused one.",
    "Roll past this casino."

Scorcese has Robert de Niro subtle, meticulous, and ruthless, Joe Pesci is every inch the tough-guy gangster who never backs down, but has a temper that is rather too immature and loose. Sam Rothstein (de Niro's character) is efficient and serves his bosses well - he's always sending the goodies back home! Sharon Stone's Ginger is a wreck, drug-induced, unstable, irrational, and apparently, very stupid. Now, how did she lure Rothstein's cool cat personality to fall for her? That's everyday life for you - the smart, cool ones do fall for those types - beautiful, with a personality and body to match, until the gold sheens off the statuette day by day. Pesci's fight scenes are brutal, but real. There is no pretence in these scenes - there is enough violence in the world to disguise such brutal depictions on celluloid. I enjoyed the desert scene, when Rothstein captures the essence in his narration as Pesci's character races through the desert - you didn't know what you could get from Pesci's character. Casino is just a magnificently handled subject, Scorcese has not gone over the top or over-done it, it's impeccably handled, the actors are just apt in their parts, and it is just fascinating to see how the gulf spreads between de Niro and Pesci's characters. Thumps up for Casino - if I may dare say it, it surpasses Goodfellas in its power and impact, and ultimately overpowers Scorcese's later movie, The Departed. Yes it does, I'm betting on it....with Sam Rothstein's back-from-the-dead character on the line!",

It became evident that there was something and that was a bonus, a filmI did not know, when I went to see this film, that there was a true story behind it. But that was something that struck me because of the way the film presents the plot. It became evident that there was something and that was a bonus, a film that, in itself, is already capable of proving itself excellent. Despite all the comparisons with \"Goodfellas\", (I couldn't help doing them myself), I don't think Scorcese tried to repeat the dose, although it is undeniable that he likes to make this kind of films, involving mafia or organized crime (\"The Irishman\", very recently, and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\", for example, not to mention the obvious \"Goodfellas\").The script shows how two Chicago mobsters manage to control and run a casino in Las Vegas until marital problems, betrayal and mistrust, addictions, greed and brutality eventually led them to their fall. There are some sub-plots that are developing equally, but everything is brilliantly orchestrated and combined by Scorcese. The film has all his style and their three hours length pass quickly. The heavy atmosphere, the brutal and raw violence, the current use of slang and f-words, are all part of a style that Scorcese associated with his gangster films. The torture scene where that guy's head was smashed into a vise is worthy of anthology, and likewise some of the scenes where Pesci gets angry and starts brutally beating those in front.Robert De Niro is one of those actors who never, or almost never, fails. And he works beautifully with Scorcese, as does Pesci. The three collaborated wonderfully here, and the result is a harmonious combination between the work of the director and the two main actors. There is not a moment out of tone. Pesci's performance was really the best of his career, much more mature and profound than in Goodfellas. Sharon Stone, in turn, had to face a difficult character, in which beauty is associated with a certain spirit of survival and a vicious cycle, that ends up leading her character to self-destruction. She has a character that requires beauty, sensuality, but also a lot of psychological depth, and the actress achieved its combination brilliantly, being nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress that year and winning the Golden Globe in the same category. She, like Pesci, achieves in this film one of her best performances ever (or at least everything I have seen of her so far). In addition to them, the film has good additions such as James Woods, Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, Pasquale Cajano and Vinny Vella, among others.Technically, the film is impeccable. Filmed inside a real casino during daily closing hours, you couldn't demand a better or more detailed set. The cinematography and camera work were also meticulously done, and editing, mixing and post-production work are impeccable. The pace is good, with scenes so well linked that the whole story is crystal clear to the audience, despite the three hours length. Finally, a word for the soundtrack, which harmonizes perfectly with what the film shows, and the general environment.This film is not just a follower in the path of \"Goodfellas\", although there are similarities in style, derived from the presence of the same director and main actors. It is a different film, less sympathetic perhaps, more brutal, realistic, intense, sometimes cynical and deeply critical. It is definitely worth seeing.",

At the center of this movie is the rise and fall of Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein, a gambling expert and mafia associate who lives the good life as a casino operator in Las Vegas - at least before the decline of his career and his personal life. The film tells a compelling story containing themes of power, greed, deception, and betrayal. Scorsese's direction is brilliant as always. The performances are stellar as well. De Niro \"aces\" his role as Rothstein, as does Joe Pesci as Nicky Santoro. The highlight is Sharon Stone as Ginger, the wife of Rothstein who seems pleasant at first - only for you to discover that she's rotten at the core.

It is shocking, disturbing and unflinching in places, particularly the part where a head gets squeezed in a vice, but that added to the atmosphere rather than distracted from it.Casino is brilliantly made too. I loved the setting, the cinematography and editing are outstanding and never take away from the atmosphere, and Martin Scorsese's direction is superb. The realism the film has is always absorbing, the subplots that form the story are intriguing and the characters are adeptly drawn.The story for me has seldom a dull moment, not with the subplots as intriguing as they are, how well made it is, how good the characters and acting are. The characters also are deliberately less endearing than are seen with Goodfellas, making it perhaps a more even portrayal of unorganised crime, but the decision to do that paid off. The acting is equally impressive. Robert DeNiro the great actor he is is incredibly charismatic, Joe Pesci gives his best performance in one of his more meatier roles and Sharon Stone(who has never been this good or even sexy before) is a revelation in a very demanding role.Overall, hugely compelling and underrated. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

This is probably Scorsese’s most overlooked film. Casino is a great movie and so underrated by a lot of people. Should really have a higher score than it has right now from critics. This is one of the best movies I’ve seen in my life, I’d put it right under Goodfellas and slightly above the Departed. It’s under appreciated and this is a movie that doesn’t get talked about enough. If you are easily offended by violence and swearing, then this film or any of Scorsese’s movies for that matter, might not be for you. But if you’re a big, diehard Scorcese fan or just into gangster movies or cinema in general, I consider this one a must watch. Make your own opinions on the film and go ahead and rate it. Overall, I give this movie a very high 9/10. Amazing soundtrack and great acting make this an excellent movie watching experience. Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci, and Robert De Niro really nailed it.In my opinion, almost as great as Goodfellas, like right up there. If you’re a little bit squeamish, well, you should still enjoy it.

It doesn`t come off as nearly repetitive as \"The Godfellas\", even though we`ve seen Presci and De Niro in many such films. This is in a huge part achieved by major role by Sharon Stone, who exceeds all expectations. There is nothing simple about her character. She never comes off as simply bad or good. Sometimes you understand her fears, sometimes you condemn her. Nevertheless, she made her own plot in this movie. From others we see the same excellent actor work, though I liked the Rothstein`s character a lot more than in other such productions. This is because he never stopped being human. At some point he even enjoys the gangster life completely, although he always chooses the more in between solutions. Joe Pesci did the rest by creating an excellent villain, though sometimes also a bit confused. The music, the camera work also excellent. Almost 3 hours of sheer virtuosity.",

The length is not unnecessary - all of it is used to develop the story and characters with excellent narration and acting. You see a film like Scarface and it's mostly just a montage - a brilliant one, but nevertheless too much jumping around. However, Casino manages to get the story across in a very believable way. The personal issues are so deeply explored, and the fact that Robert De Niro is a \"good guy\" really adds an extra perspective. In every other film, everyone ends up being a baddy and gets whacked or goes to jail. But in this one, it was interesting to see the story from two perspectives - De Niro's and Pesci's. The two actors suited their characters' roles perfectly, and the pacing was inline with how quickly one can imagine events developed. The rise, the top and the fall all got their relative share of the action according to how long they last. Best of all, the movie was not about doing crime for the sake of it - it was actually mostly about business and not killing people randomly with a few deals being used as a cover-up. The direction and general style of story and development etc. are almost identical to Goodfellas, so if you enjoyed that this is definitely worth watching as well.",

Pesci pretty much repeats his short-tempered mobster from Goodfellas. Both films have similar eclectic rock backgrounds (including heavy usage of Rolling Stones songs). Plus the f-bomb is dropped pretty frequently. Yet Casino still has some positive points to help it stand on its own. From the great writing to the beautiful cinematography, Casino isn't a slapped-together and hastily-made effort. It is a great film with a great story that starts off on a documentary-esque note but slowly reveals itself as the gritty crime drama Scorsese fans fervently crave. The cast is great too. Pesci (who really is the only one who can play short-tempered gangsters like Nicky Santoro) and Stone (surprisingly) shine in their roles. But it is De Niro that deserves the cake as Ace Rothstein as he gives an exceptional performance showing emotion while smoothly restricting it with inner power.Of course, there are some scenes in Casino that feel overdone with language and/or violence to the point where the scene looks comedic. Plus there are scenes that kind of allude to Goodfellas (especially the Pesci beatdown scene) since actors from the former film are reused in Casino. And that kind of ruins some of the original magic that Casino holds, as it isn't a wholly new film. Nonetheless, the Scorsese-De Niro-Pesci trio rock well, regardless of the flaws.",

Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci were phenomenal here as expected and, though I heard evidence to the contrary, I never thought the violence was too much. For the most part, it was relatively tame compared to other films I have seen. In addition, the story was very good and never failed to be completely engrossing. The characters were well crafted and their arcs very interesting to follow. There were a lot of them, sure, but it was never too overwhelming. In addition, the true story aspect of this made the story really work and I can see why Scorsese was drawn to this, as it feels like a very Scorsese film, as thematically it is similar to many of his other works. For the most part, it felt a bit like Goodfellas in a casino, but I did not really mind that. The only thing that really stuck out to me was the narration. I think the story could have been told without it and the narration, at times, could distract from the story. However, otherwise, this was a pretty easy one to watch, even with it being three hours long.",

Badly shot (it looks ugly) and scarce in compelling performances. De Niro is his usual self, but displaying far less depth than in any other Scorcese role he's played. To have to watch the trials and tribulations of these lowlife characters for a merciless three hours is a massive chore. Like in the highly overrated, but superior Goodfellas, these characters are as glib and one-dimensional as they are amoral and this time around, it not only appears as if he has recreated the very same formula, but has in the process of creating such an ambitious project has devoted far too little time to skillful writing or even a sense of plausibility. Thus while Goodfellas palpable sense of realism compensated for the lack of dimension in its story, Casino fails miserably in both departments. What it appears we're left with is 180 minutes of lowest common denominator sleaze and violence. With not a single compelling character or any trace of inventiveness or ingenuity, viewers are expected to appreciate it on that back of its abundant display of sadistic blood-drenched spectacle.

Director Martin Scorsese makesMartin Scorsese's Casino is a great film, expected from a director of Scorsese's stature. Casino opens with short sequence in 1983 before moving on to the meat of the story, which is related through flashbacks. Director Martin Scorsese makes heavy use of voiceovers, employing disembodied monologues by both lead actors -- Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci -- to fill in gaps. The sheer volume of words sporadically detracts from character development, but it is integrated successfully enough not to seem overly intrusive. In every way -- from the fantastic sets, rich dialogue, and unapologetic violence to the well-portrayed characters and themes of loyalty and betrayal -- Casino is pure Scorsese. Although not the director's top work, this is nevertheless compelling film making. Casino sparkles like its fake diamond of a host city. The cinematography, which uses surprisingly few tricks other than freeze-framing to emphasize key moments, is crisp and clean.(Top tier film from a top tier filmmaker).",

Great performances and acting especially by Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and James Woods and some of Casino is mildly amusing thanks to Joe Pesci's over the top and constant bad language approach.
