  "critic_reviews": [
    "Fair Game works as a thriller for anyone who lives entirely in the present.",
    "A thriller primarily about the movement of Cindy Crawford's breasts beneath a succession of ever-smaller T-shirts.",
    "Will you find yourself wishing you were looking at someone else? Not really.",
    "Not bad enough to be good.... This vigorous, pinheaded action flick asks us to accept Cindy as a lawyer.",
    "This is right up there with the dumbest pictures of the year.",
    "Fair Game is howlingly bad - so awful, in fact, that it can actually be enjoyed on a certain level.",
    "Fair Game, written and directed by men, allows model Cindy Crawford to make her screen debut as Miami lawyer Kate McQueen.",
    "Very slick and extremely silly, not to mention aptly titled, Fair Game is just that - a noisy actioner so inanely scripted, acted, and directed that it practically begs you to make fun of it.",
    "The only heat that rises from the movie is mechanical.",
    "Fair Game is otherwise notable only for its jaw-dropping stupidity, the sort of action yarn that hopes nonstop mayhem will help cloud just how nonsensical it is.",
    "The movie is fast, slick and dumb as a post.",
    "Don't imagine there is any reason to see Fair Game."
