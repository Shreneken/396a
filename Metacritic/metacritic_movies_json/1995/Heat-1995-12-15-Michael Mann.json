  "critic_reviews": [
    "Stunningly made and incisively acted by a large and terrific cast, Michael Mann's ambitious study of the relativity of good and evil stands apart from other films of its type by virtue of its extraordinarily rich characterizations and its thoughtful, deeply melancholy take on modern life.",
    "One of the most intelligent crime-thrillers to come along in years.",
    "A sleek, accomplished piece of work, meticulously controlled and completely involving. The dark end of the street doesn't get much more inviting than this.",
    "Heat is in the cop-movie pantheon with Akira Kurosawa's \"High and Low,\" and that's as \"right\" as the genre gets.",
    "A stunning crime drama that shares its protagonists' rabid attention to detail—and love of adrenalin.",
    "As with his other works, [Mann] binds sound, music and pictures into one hypnotic triaxial cable and plugs it right into your brain. He makes this almost-three-hour experience practically glide by.",
    "Above all, the dialogue is complex enough to allow the characters to say what they're thinking: They are eloquent, insightful, fanciful, poetic when necessary. They're not trapped with cliches.",
    "No, the film may not be quite as luminous as the cast, but it's good - very good, in fact.",
    "It didn't sound like fun to us, either, but we were wrong; Heat scores on many fronts...The plot, though it seems to ramble, builds suspense with deft precision, and the action set pieces are triumphs.",
    "There's nothing really new...but it has craft, pacing, and an overall sense of proportion, three pretty rare classic virtues nowadays.",
    "It's a monster of a movie, and it gets unwieldy.",
    "We're not watching McCauley and Hanna anymore; we're watching De Niro and Pacino trying to out-insinuate each other. For a few moments, Heat truly has some.",
    "Ultimately, though, the movie never transcends the limitations of its Hemingwayesque, men-with-men attitudes.",
    "I lost track of how many times I checked my watch during the nearly three interminable hours it took Heat to play itself to a predictable conclusion of a chase scene and a shoot-out.",
    "The performances are persuasive but the plot rattles on much too long.",
    "There isn't much to recommend this movie until Pacino and De Niro finally share the first of their two scenes together.",
    "A 3 hour fusillade of cliches."

Pacino and de Niro are just perfect for the characters they play, the direction is equally strong. The length of the movie might be a bit too long for the usual Hollywood flick, but this is serious, heady stuff. Pacino is quintessential and meticulous as the cop who knows a challenge when he sees one, de Niro is the smooth operator who must always stay a step ahead. The leader of a fearsome crew, de Niro's silent, tough control over his team, over their future, is just perfect. The supporting cast are equally commendable. Of Michael Mann's best movies, Heat is certainly one of them. Cliched? Not one bit. The best scene of the movie isn't just the diner-coffee scene, it's the first one where de Niro ascends the electric stairs and on to the pavement. You see the look, the fierceness in his face, the way he walks and does his business, the perfect character played by the perfect actor. Pacino is no less powerful, the way he hankers after his informant, Eddy, the way he gets the 'slick' lead from Eddy's cousin, the way he prowls and stalks de Niro's crew, his tireless dedication to his work - Mann has just handled both these magnificent actors as well as any director has ever done so, with balance and precision. Pacino and de Niro are subdued in their fierceness, no over-the-top overacting by these two fine actors, it's just classic, downright methodical acting. The story builds up, adds more intrigue and suspense by the minute....Heat is one for the ages. I should say it, I've seen it no fewer than 15 times, from start to end!",

It manages to keep your attention throughout despite being a long film. It's suspenseful, deep and eventful. The characters are well-developed, and there's a perfect balance between action and story. At first there seems to be two unrelated movies in one going on at the same time, but the way it comes together, and especially the moment when the two main characters meet makes for a great scene. Overall, Heat is not a shallow action film, but isn't hard to follow or boring to watch. There aren't any points where you feel the time is wasted. Every minute of the film is put to good use and offers variety, rather than focusing purely on action or purely on developing the backstory for the characters. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro did a tremendous job in this film, and made it a must-watch.",

Having heard about how influential it has been in other movies and video games, I couldn't believe that I had waited so long to see this movie. Boy, was I disappointed. This movie is far from the masterpiece that I was led to believe. Other than a couple of great crime scenes (and a little bit of great action), I can't think of much that this film had that would make me want to see it again.While I wouldn't characterize the acting as bad, I can't think of anyone in this movie who gave a performance that is among their better ones. Al Pacino is practically a caricature of himself the entire time. He overacts in every scene and he yells about half of his lines. Robert Deniro has the same scowl on his face and speaks in pretty much the same voice for the whole movie. Pacino and Deniro fans looking for some \"tough guy\" porn will find plenty of it here.Ultimately, Heat is a movie that could have been made better by cutting about half the content. It is loaded with characters that are poorly developed, but are dramatically presented as if you are supposed to give a crap about any of them. One of them gets killed after about four minutes of screen time, and after that, we see his grieving wife. Rather than cry with her, I just kind of rolled my eyes. Another gang members death is presented with the drama akin to a squad mate getting killed in a war movie. I could have cared less. Val Kilmer's subplot centers around the tenuous relationship that he has with his wife. Al Pacino has a lousy third marriage and Robert Deniro somehow manages to have a romance side plot that is neither relevant nor believable.There is even a suicide attempt scene that has nothing whatsoever to do with the story – a diversion that will have you scratching your head, wondering why so much celluloid was wasted on it. Without exception, every single scene with a female in it could have been left on the cutting room floor, and not one shred of value would have been lost. None of the characters are sympathetic or well developed enough for you to want to see their romances work or to be able to share their pain. It would have worked well maybe in a television series where you would have more time to develop the characters, but here, all of the side plot material is really boring.One of the draws of this movie seems to be that it is a \"realistic\" and non ideal take on human behavior. Okay, I get that, but if you are going to go with the \"realistic\" approach, then don't ruin it with the occasional unbelievable scene or plot hole. The biggest offender is the famous bank robbery scene in the middle of the movie. It would have been spectacular in an action movie that didn't take itself seriously. But in Heat, I couldn't stop thinking about how absurd it was that a few guys with automatic weapons were able to cut through the entire LAPD like a hot knife through butter, escaping clean in the process. I still greatly enjoyed that scene, largely because it's just a great action scene that is well choreographed and shot. However, it's sort of out of place in this film.I'll give Heat some credit for not being a by-the-numbers cops and robbers movie. Maybe it is this uniqueness and the time of its release that made it so popular. Upon reflection though, there have been many crime and caper movies over the past few decades that are more entertaining than this one. Scarface, Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects, to name but a few. While I didn't hate this movie, I certainly don't think that it deserves a place in the Top 10 greatest crime dramas.",

But to give it a negative review, let alone a zero -- that just shows you have absolutely no clue about films or cinema.  Yes, there are some \"cliches\", but what do you expect from a cop/robber film?  They weren't trying to reinvent crime here, they were trying to show the lives of a highly proficient crime ring and an obsessed FBI agent, and the people in their circles that their actions affect.  And the movie does an outstanding job of this.  This is not a pure action film by any stretch, yet it has some excellent action scenes.  If you're looking for fast-paced, high-action, over-utilized CGI, there are plenty of crappy films out there to satisfy you.  This is more of a slowly unfolding drama with actual character development and meaningful underlying story-lines (an art lost in present-day action films).

With riveting performances from an all-star cast and an interesting plot, it had the potential to be great entertainment on many levels. But post-production choices by director Mann turned this into an unwieldy two hour and forty minute beast.Everything just goes on too long, underscored by a narcotic soundtrack that leaves the audience twitching in their seats instead of on the edge of their seats. The turning point scene where the two main characters first meet face-to-face should have been a cerebral break in the action and relationship drama, but instead comes after many minutes of plodding, unnecessary footage. The ending was also a huge letdown considering how much the proficiencies of both main characters had been built up over the course of the film.Still, there are some great individual performances and scenes in this film, so I'm giving it a rating that makes it worth watching, though not a must see. 6/10.",

The movie starts with such a shot: the camera is set in between the elevated tracks of a metro railway and centered on a station silhouetted against the early dawn sky. The lights in the shot define what we see. A metro moves into view from the right and stops at the station. The next shot shows de Niro stepping out. We hear nothing but the music playing and the sounds of the metro and the city. An awesome shot.\r The movie is carried by the acting and the visual style, but hampered by the weak and overburdened plot.   No less than three relations are followed as side stories, which allows some roles for women, albeit in the overcrowded niche of troubled partnerships. Mann is not one for strong independent women or ones that stand by their men.. Despite all the women(or maybe because of this), this is a man's movie foremost. No pun intended.\r The weakness of Heat is that Mann cannot quite make the plot stick. At the beginning, we start out with de Niro and his men robbing an armored money car with such gratuitous violence that it must have attracted crowds of onlookers as they are in the middle of LA, yet only one hobo was a witness to the events. This then is the reason that further on into the movie Pacino forestalls an arrest : they got nothing on them.  Another event that is badly handled is when the gang is caught robbing a bank. Again overdone violence results(another Mann trademark) whereby the three crooks fight off a police force that out guns and out man's them. They not only manage to take out seven policemen but get away with the loss of one of them and one wounded. All thanks to their never ending supply of bullets.\r Mann can not turn violence into something that does not hamper the plot. Shoot up half the town and nobody can point a finger. So, in the end, some ratting needs to be done, by a woman of course. But again: what evidence do they have that they did not have before? Nothing actually. So we just kill them all. With that the movie is actually about the morally bankrupt, perhaps another Mann trademark.\r Women do get the short end of the stick. They are a source of trouble: if they aren't nagging they are cheating and if they aren't cheating they are selling out their partners. And if they do neither of those they are best at whoring, lying or cowering in fear. The message: women, you can't do without them, just don't expect much too of them. And maybe that is another trademark of Mann.\r Short: it just takes too long and overreaches itself. Collateral is a lot better.",

Possibly even better than The Godfather, the movie franchise which bought Al Pacino and Robert De Niro together for the first time. One of the main differences this time is that they are playing enemies, and they do it very well. I found the scene, just before the hugely famous bank robbery sequence, where Pacino and De Niro are explaining their intentions to each other over coffee to be ridiculously tense. So tense that I was almost feeling uncomfortable! Val Kilmer and Natalie Portman (in one of her earliest roles) are brilliant as part of the supporting cast too. It's a shame Michael Mann didn't direct anymore movies like this because Heat is to be blunt the only memorable work he has ever done. It definitely could be shorter but that doesn't mean it isn't exciting, personally I enjoyed the last hour the most due to the extremely tense coffee scene and of course the unforgettable gunfight in the street.",

HEAT has a rather great story about a cops obsession with catching a criminal named Neil McCauley and this maybe not the exact story but it pretty much sums it up. Vincent Hannah (Al Pacino) and his platoon of cop buddies are on the lookout to catch Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) in the act and wait for the right time to pounce on Neil McCauley (De Niro) and his criminal gang or crew who take scores and basically break the law.. The other criminals working with Neil McCauley are Chris (Val Kilmer),  Michael(Tom Sizemore) and Trejo played by Danny Trejo... Jon Voight is a villain also as he gets involved with De Niro if only by discussion.. So Robert De Niro and his crew do armed robberies and take scores and Vincent Hannah who's played by Al Pacino and who's an LAPD cop tends to stop him and his crew. Neil McCauley (De Niro) is still trying to track down someone who did a job for him but escaped De Niro and his criminal gang one mysterious night and hasn't been seen since and has kept a low profile. The escaped man in question is Waingro played by Kevin Gage but after one of the gang is close to death and criminal mastermind Neil McCauley (De Niro) finds him and hears Waingro is involved and some dude named Van Zant then De Niro tacks Waingro down and unloads a couple of bullets in him. When he leaves the building it's swarmed with innocents pouring out of the building and LAPD Lt. Vincent Hannah (Pacino) waiting for him so then belongs a footchase and bullets going off... The rest is a surprise and you probably know the ending. HEAT is full of violence and great acting and bad language and helicopter scenes in the night sky beautifully made and directed.",

This is just a fantastic film, a non-stop trill ride that never stops the action to tell the story. The film has an intense and engaging plot. Criminal Neil McCauley(played by Robert De Niro) leads a team of robbers on a armored car heist to rob 1.6 million dollars in bearer bonds. All goes well until one of the robbers, Waingro, murders a guard, which forces the criminals to muder the rest of the guards. This enrages McCauley, who tries to have Waingro murdered later outside of a diner, but Waingro manages to escape. Meanwhile, hot on their trail is Lieutenant Vincent Hanna(played by Al Pacino), an LAPD homicide detective who has been on McCauleys trail for quite some time. This leads to a thrilling cat-and-mouse game between McCauley and Hanna. This film is very well acted by Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Val Kimer and the cinematography is absolutle top notch.

Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are the best part of this movie. The writing for the characters is great. A problem I have with Heat is that I think it is a little too long. It is 2 hours and 52 minutes long and it can get a little boring.That is my biggest issue with the film, but I think it is pretty good. I would definitely recommend it for people who like heist movies.",

In Heat they still onlyHeat was technically the first-time acting legends Al Pacino and Robert De Niro would star in, and this was, and is big news. Both stalwarts had starred in the Godfather 2 but they were never together on the screen. In Heat they still only have two scenes but they more than make up for it by some exemplary work by the director Michael Mann and the rest of the cast. Heat looks at both sides of the law as it chronicles an armored truck robbery and the subsequent fallout. With typical precision, Mann builds tension not through contrivances but through character identification and the ever-present prospect of violence. Everything in Heat builds to a climactic confrontation that occurs with nearly an hour still remaining. Employing a forceful score by Elliot Goldenthal, evocative imagery by the legendary Dante Spinotti, and top-notch acting by a dream cast, Mann works his magic to fashion an epic crime story out of a seemingly standard-order story.(A must watch for any cinema enthusiast).",

The robbery scene is one of the best ever but then the film begins to be self indulgent and full of clichés. The characters are written to be spectacular rather than real (especially the character of Al Pacino) and many scenes seem to be shot only for the mood but are not functional at all.
