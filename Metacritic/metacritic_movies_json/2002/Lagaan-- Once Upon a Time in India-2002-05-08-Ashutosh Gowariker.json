  "critic_reviews": [
    "The sunny, funny, toe-tapping Lagaan is the answer to those who ask why they don't make movies like they used to: They do, but in India.",
    "Rippingly good, old-fashioned movie epic.",
    "A movie that amply delivers on the epic promise of its title, entertaining, enlightening, and emboldening viewers with its deceptively simple premise and execution.",
    "The unlikeliest enthralling movie to be released so far this year.",
    "An inspiring effort, lavishly lensed and featuring a spicy (if occasionally synthy) score from A.R. Rahman. Best of all, it's also something of a musical, as the characters are not above breaking into song and dance to serve their emotions.",
    "It works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film's length becomes a part of its fun.",
    "Features colorful song-and-dance numbers that look and sound best in surround sound and on a huge screen.",
    "An enormously entertaining movie, like nothing we've ever seen before, and yet completely familiar.",
    "Think of this corrective to Kipling as \"The Longest Yard\" meets \"The Seven Samurai\" with cricket bats, choreographed dance numbers, romantic triangles and a rousing call to solidarity.",
    "If you've never experienced a Bollywood musical before, seeing Lagaan will be like watching \"Gone With the Wind\" without ever having seen a Hollywood movie.",
    "Gowariker's stunningly choreographed, four-hour spectacle (reportedly one of the most expensive films in the industry's history) is a fascinating mix of Hollywood genres and tropes.",
    "Raises it to the level of an art film with fully drawn characters, a serious underlying theme, and a sophisticated style and point of view.",
    "Not only the best I've ever seen, but also the Indian film that'd be most accessible to a Western audience.",
    "Neither pure masala musical nor pure masala meller, Lagaan is an involving, easily digestible hunk of pure entertainment that could be the trigger for Bollywood's long-awaited crossover to non-ethnic markets.",
    "Lagaan may look naïve; it is anything but. This is a movie that knows its business — pleasing a broad, popular audience -- and goes about it with savvy professionalism and genuine flair.",
    "By the time Lagaan climaxes with 90 minutes of remarkably riveting cricket, the stakes and the effects on the players have taken on a vivid clarity, and what might have started out as corny clichés have become the stuff of classic movie entertainment.",
    "Confident and brash, Lagaan may be high-concept New Bollywood, but it plays like well-crafted Old Hollywood.",
    "An epic film in every respect.",
    "A wild, self-indulgent but completely captivating extravagance.",
    "Isn't as lavish or flashy as the typical Bollywood product, and cricket aside, there's little to distinguish the plotting and wide-screen visuals from more traditional Hollywood musicals--though few recent American musicals are this fluid or engaging.",
    "If you've never seen a \"masala\" musical, you may find Lagaan hilariously bad. Cartoony acting, dreadful dialogue, obvious dubbing, and meandering but ultrapredictable plots are simply part of the Bollywood package, along with six musical numbers and a bizarre mixture of romance, comedy and melodrama."

I had joined Climb First for GMAT preparation and I met Mr. Vinod there who has cleared his examination. He advised me to prepare strategy plan as per Lagaan movie. At Climb first, Vinod advised me that to crack GMAT Examination, 11 things are very important, same like 11 members in a team.  1. Quant, 2. English, 3. Analytical Writing Assessment,4. Level of Difficulty 1 & 2, 5. Keep in Mind about different range of questions, 6. Time Management, 7. Stress Management, 8. Shortlisting of Universities, 9. Tips for Interview, 10. I should justify why I want to do MBA, 11. Where I see myself after MBA. These are the 11 things. If we can coordinate and club all these 11, then we can make it as a team and can hit the goal. I really appreciate Vinod whom I met at Climb First to give these tips I applied and cleared my GMAT. I got a score of 730 in GMAT.",
