  "summary": "The story of three childhood friends, Lucy (Spears), Kit (Saldana) and Mimi (Manning), who, after eight years apart, rediscover their friendship on a cross-country trip.  (Paramount Pictures)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Not only makes excellent use of the singer's sweetly coltish acting abilities, but it also promotes a standardized set of sturdy values with none of Mariah Carey's desperate ''Glitter,'' or any of Mandy Moore's gummy pap in ''A Walk to Remember.''",
    "Spears delivers a performance with the same sincerity she invests into a Pepsi commercial, only this film contains twice the sugary calories.",
    "Highbrow self-appointed guardians of culture need not apply, but those who loved \"Cool as Ice\" have at last found a worthy follow-up.",
    "Marks the emergence of a talented young actress. Not Britney -- who has the amateur's tendency to stand looking awkward after delivering her lines -- but Manning (Crazy/Beautiful), who plays Mimi with the gusto of a young Holly Hunter. Though she has little competition here, when she's on the screen she pretty much owns it.",
    "Fascinating in its own strange way, not as entertainment but as a cultural document.",
    "Packaged fluff aimed low, and patronizingly, at Spears's legion of young female fans.",
    "Everything she (Spears) does seems diluted and secondhand and is never transformed into something original or indelibly self-expressive.",
    "Adults will wish the movie were less simplistic, obvious, clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized. But what are adults doing in the theater at all?",
    "Here's what Crossroads does not have: Cohesive direction from Tamra Davis, intelligent dialogue, a comprehensible plot.",
    "This is a star vehicle that stalls.",
    "So vanilla yet so transcendentally sleazy that its target audience seems to be pubescent girls and dirty old priests.",
    "Spears, Davis, and company are well aware that they're making nothing more than the cinematic equivalent of Spears' glossy bubble gum pop -- but that's exactly the problem.",
    "The movie is a lumbering load of hokum, but unlike those other recent pop star white elephants -- it's at least watchable.",
    "The film's mealy-mouthed messages about feminine empowerment will almost certainly fall on deaf ears, since even 11-year-olds know Spears's power resides largely in her taut torso.",
    "Less a movie than a mind-numbingly dull road trip.",
    "I went to Crossroads expecting a glitzy bimbofest and got the bimbos but not the fest. Britney Spears' feature debut is curiously low-key and even sad.",
    "Crossroads may now fall into the same paragraph as \"Glitter,\" Mariah Carey's disastrous star vehicle.",
    "Not a music video, not yet a movie, but more like an extended-play advertisement for the Product that is Britney.",
    "You spend a lot of time wondering, \"Better or worse than Glitter?\" You think if the projectionist cranked the volume a little you could actually sort of get into this.",
    "When the cast is shown during the final credits repeatedly cracking up in blown takes, one would like to think they were laughing at some of the lines they were expected to deliver.",
    "Young girls are the only ones likely to enjoy this vapid road-trip movie.",
    "In a way, it's probably unfair to blame director Tamra Davis exclusively for this debacle. After all, she's toiling in the shadow of a would-be multi-media superstar, making her essentially a hired gun.",
    "Spears is filmed and costumed in such a harsh, unflattering manner that it looks like Christina Aguilera bribed the crew to make her rival look as hideous as possible. Spears' ubiquity has spawned an inevitable backlash, but the awful Crossroads ought to do more harm to her career than even the most powerful Britney-basher.",
    "Awfully lame bigscreen debut for pop diva Britney Spears.",
    "Spears acquits herself as well as anyone might, in a movie as contrived and lazy as this one.",
    "So dull, a road-trip movie that's surprisingly short of both adventure and song.",
    "A movie so pathetically lame that hopefully even Spears most ardent young fans will give this stinker a big thumbs down.",
    "It does wonders to a critic to know that [Britney] could be a continuing font of teen and post-teen kitsch for years to come.",
    "Functions mainly as a big-screen showcase for America's No. 1 teen tease, with the story and other characters serving mainly as accessories."
