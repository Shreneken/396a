  "summary": "Guy Ritchie's contemporary adaptation of Lina Wertmuller's 1974 romantic comedy, a story of love, sex, drugs and too much money -- all set against the backdrop of a Mediterranean island paradise.  (Sony)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Ritchie made a movie that never pretends to be more than a guilty pleasure of soft-core kitsch, and Madonna and Giannini (son of Giancarlo, costar of the original) achieve a lively S&M chemistry.",
    "At its best, Swept Away is like a scrapbook of postcards starring two lovebirds with great tans.",
    "Madonna herself is not so much terrible as merely uninvolving. She's quite credible as the harpy of the first act, but she can't pull off the transition and the spark that makes a movie star instantly sympathetic.",
    "A simple misfire rather than a world-class fiasco. This misguided attempt to remake Lina Wertmuller's corrosive 1974 satire as a wistful romance is only unintentionally funny in the last reel.",
    "Schizoid romantic comedy -- The first half of the movie is full of broad but capable comedy, but the original film's sexual and class politics are clumsily handled, and the mood turns serious with all the subtlety of a falling guillotine blade.",
    "The effectiveness of this kind of issue-driven give and take relies heavily on casting, and Ritchie puts himself at a disadvantage: Madonna looks terrific in a bikini but she can't act, and the younger Giannini is stunt casting.",
    "One hopes that this is Hollywood's last go-round with Swept Away. Watching this fiasco, I kept having nightmares about a possible cartoon version, co-starring Cruella de Vil and Shrek.",
    "A bad movie. No amount of perfume sprayed on talk show audiences by Madonna and her husband can eliminate the stench of failure emanating from this motion picture.",
    "The fact that Swept Away got made at all implies there simply is no dissuading Madonna from her movie-star aspirations. Her tenacity is admirable, but it's also block-headed.",
    "Madonna may be better in this film than she's been in some of her recent endeavors, especially when she stops screeching her lines, but she's done herself no favors with her choice of material.",
    "For starters, it blows. Madonna continues to mistake a knack for striking poses with the interpretive skill of a real actor.",
    "No less laughable is the ending, where Ritchie  neatly reflects today's prevailing attitude -- that audiences can't be trusted to handle a hint of ambiguity, but can live happily with flat-out stupidity.",
    "A deserted island movie during which I desperately wished the characters had chosen one movie to take along if they were stranded on a deserted island, and were showing it to us instead of this one.",
    "The junior Giannini, who has inherited Giancarlo's handsome looks, portrays his mercurial character with energy and flair. Madonna doesn't. Indeed, it's hard to remember the last time a certified celebrity gave a performance so monotonous, unimaginative, and all-around tiresome to watch.",
    "Merely an indulgent vehicle for Mrs. Ritchie -- and Madonna is so spectacularly convincing as a hateful, self-absorbed, nouveau riche ogress that her character's third-act transformation is as preposterous as her overmuscled physique.",
    "At no point should anyone mistake this for an actual movie. This is an extended beach video that will leave no one swept away.",
    "There is no credible feeling here, no comedy, no eroticism.",
    "Suggests that we're supposed to take this love story as something more than farce. Please. Tom Hanks fucking that volleyball would have been more convincing.",
    "Ritchie's frivolous comedy tries to have it both ways, thinning out the material for mass consumption while still sticking to the script -- an unstable alchemy that backfires horribly.",
    "Isn't dubbed. But it sure feels like it. The characters open their mouths and their lips don't seem to be shaping the right words -- you can't believe any human beings would ever utter such ludicrous dialogue, with so little conviction.",
    "The film turns out to have nothing going for it at all, except a small charge for soul-deep Madonna haters.",
    "If you were expecting Ritchie to discover something in Madonna that no one else has, something like, say, acting talent, forget it.",
    "It certainly didn't take long for Madonna to ruin husband Guy Ritchie's career.",
    "Even camp status eludes this tepid and misguided picture.",
    "Not as bad as rumor would have it. It's worse.",
    "A shrill, amateurish two-character play that demeans women and leaves men with the quaint notion that the best way to a woman's heart is through enslavement."

It is one of the worst films I have ever had the displeasure to watch. Madonna's acting was just unbelievably bad, as well as Giannini's was (if not worse, even). The predictable storyline is not just predictable, but it is almost insulting to one's intelligence. Horrible story, horrible acting, dialogue that could be better used on a piece of toilet paper: that is what Swept Away is. Definitely deserved all 5 Razzie Awards it won... as well as the two it failed winning.",

Americans are like \"it's painful to watch thus I'm not watching it\" and Russians are \"it's so painful to watch and I'm rewatching it when possible\". Masochistic approach. Plus, there's always this \"Americans are trashing this movie - must be a good one\". And, of course, according to us, Russians did it earlier with cult and still famous \"The Fourty-First\" (1956) winning award in Cannes. That's why Lina's version was not original, too. It's a little consolation for Madonna and Guy, of course. But, you know, Fellini was treated as **** before he was awarded at Moscow Film Festival. The only minus of this movie - no Madonna song on soundtrack. Such a waste.",
