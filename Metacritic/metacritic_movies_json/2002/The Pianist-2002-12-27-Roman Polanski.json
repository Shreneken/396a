  "rating": 8.0,
  "release_date": "2002-12-27",
  "summary": "Wladyslaw Szpilman, a brilliant Polish pianist, a Jew, escapes deportation.  Forced to live in the heart of the Warsaw ghetto, he shares the suffering, the humiliation and the struggles.  He manages to escape and hides in the ruins of the capital.  A German officer comes to his aid and helps him to survive. (Focus Features)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Polanski, himself a survivor of Nazi-occupied Poland, has created a near-masterpiece.",
    "There are three Poles in The Pianist -- Szpilman, Polanski, and Frederic Chopin. Of the three, fittingly, Chopin speaks the loudest.",
    "Roman Polanski's new movie may be the greatest historical film centered on an enigmatic character since Lawrence of Arabia.",
    "The director seems to be saying that, for survivors, art may be a way back to our finer selves -- extraordinary.",
    "The best film of 2002.",
    "A great movie on a powerful, essential subject -- the Holocaust years in Poland -- directed with such artistry and skill that, as we watch, the barriers of the screen seem to melt away.",
    "One of the great Holocaust films.",
    "A beautiful story, told in measured cadences by a master of old-timey narrative compression and expression.",
    "The result is a movie, and Cannes Palme d'Or winner, of riveting power and sadness, a great match of film and filmmaker -- and star, too.",
    "It's no wonder that Polanski, himself an artist who has survived a series of nightmares, should tell it so naturally and powerfully.",
    "The results are masterful, admirably unsentimental, and never boring, if also a little stodgy.",
    "This powerful, precision-made movie offers hope as well -- an act of kindness from a German officer that saves the pianist’s life, the music that sustains his soul.",
    "Never before has a fiction film so clearly and to such devastating effect laid out the calculation of the Nazi machinery of death and its irrationality.",
    "There have been other films dealing with the Jewish ghettos during the Nazi occupation of Poland -- some very good -- but The Pianist, the latest feature from Roman Polanski, may be the best.",
    "Polanski’s strongest and most personally felt movie.",
    "Polanski, who was a Jewish child in Krakow when the Germans arrived in September 1939, presents Szpilman's story with bleak, acid humor and with a ruthless objectivity that encompasses both cynicism and compassion.",
    "Szpilman takes to performing sonatas in thin air, eyes closed, those jittery fingers stroking nothing but air. It's a wonderful moment in a wonderful, ghastly film, and one of the most moving arguments for the redemptive powers of art ever made.",
    "After an hour, The Pianist stops being the Holocaust movie and becomes a Holocaust movie.",
    "Polanski's view of life is like that of Greek tragedy, with the same cold comfort that tragedy implies; from the larger perspective which art gives us, we know even horrors eventually pass.",
    "If The Pianist isn't quite as devastating as \"Schindler's List\" -- the movie with which all other Holocaust movies must be compared -- it's because Polanski isn't interested in an expansive view of the war.",
    "With this 2002 Cannes Film Festival best-picture winner, Polanski skips the quirky flourishes and simply brings history to life.",
    "To the extent that movies bear the residue of their filmmakers' autobiographies, I found The Pianist particularly compelling.",
    "The power of the arts to transcend cultural differences is presumably what moves the German to spare Szpilman, and, perhaps, is the key to Polanski's salvation as well.",
    "The closing scenes of the movie involve Szpilman's confrontation with a German captain named Wilm Hosenfeld -- Polanski's direction of this scene, his use of pause and nuance, is masterful.",
    "Crafted without a whiff of melodrama, this motion picture takes a steady, unflinching look at the plight of Jews in Warsaw.",
    "Nothing can detract from the film as a portrait of hell so shattering it's impossible to shake.",
    "Polanski's film is an unqualified success both dramatically and artistically.",
    "To name only one of its predecessors -- for me, the towering one -- doesn't \"Schindler's List\" do everything that Polanski achieves and more?",
    "Does the world need another Holocaust film? When the director is Roman Polanski, the answer is an unequivocal “yes.\"",
    "A raw, unblinking film. It teaches that in dire circumstances our only obligation is to our own survival; all else -- culture, ideology, even love -- is a dispensable luxury.",
    "Polanski, wisely, doesn't interpret or explain. He seems to have decided that in the face of such meticulously planned horror, the best one can do is get the details right.",
    "The Pianist recalls \"Schindler's List,\" even down to its weakness: Just as Spielberg's film turned sentimental in its final half hour, Polanski's work, too, has a schmaltz coda. But that doesn't make The Pianist any less effective.",
    "Has a sense of emotional urgency and deep-dwelling grief.",
    "Through Brody's remarkably controlled, self-effacing performance, Polanski succeeds in making his hero an invisible man, but the sights he conjures are surprisingly artless and ordinary, familiar from a dozen other Holocaust dramas. Among the casualties in The Pianist is a great director's imagination.",
    "Suffers from over-explanation. The movie maintains tremendous momentum through the Szpilman family's deportation. The second half is another story.",
    "Offers nothing new. It's actually one of Polanski's more conventional films and, ultimately, it's hard to recommend it with a clear conscience.",
    "At the risk of being called an anti-Semite, I would like to propose a moratorium on Holocaust movies -- While it would be crass to discount the importance of the subject, at the same time one has to admit there is some degree of excess going on here.",
    "Surprisingly lacks a feeling of personal urgency and insight that would have made it a distinctive, even unique contribution to the considerable number of films that deal with the war in general and Holocaust in particular."

There are no only good or bad sides here. It shows us that the war never really changed poeple to mindless warmongering zombies. There were bad and good people everywhere. The story of a young Jewish radio pianist is interesting as the perspective is shown from his secret flat provided by the Polish. Everything he experienced most of the time was viewing from his apartment`s window. The apocalyptic reality of ghettos also have some time in this movie so we can see how he Germans treated their slaves. The character played by Adrien Brody is likeable and interesting to the point we want to stick with the story. And in this movie we see another page of history which is Germans destroying Warsaw. In the end I felt sorry for Wilm Hosenfeld and I reflected upon how unjust and random war is.",

The piano playing sequences are pretentious and obvious and the rest of the film feels like a missed opportunity. Why doesn't it tackle issues like the prejudices of slavic poles towards the jews.

At the end of the film when Brody is back in the radio studio playing the piano (where the film began) we understand EXACTLY what he is feeling when he looks at his friend who has walked into the sound room. I guess some people need to be hit with a baseball bat in order to feel anything. The low votes for this film are just a reflection of our dumbed down and numbed culture.",

This film does not make use of elaborate or groundbraking camera techniques, doesn't over-play it's coloring or even it's wonderful sets- Roman allowed the story to speak greatly for itself. In simplicity, this film achieved more than Space Odyssey did with all it's grandeur, in my opinion. My mother, a professional musician, asked why it was called 'The Pianist', as there wasn't much applicable piano playing in the movie- but the title is about so much more than that. To me, it basically hands you the character on a silver platter- music is all he is, and is such an underlying force in his survival. The scene where the officer tells him to play once he's been found in the house, I could feel that passion of returning to his own little world. Music creates that head space for him and he becomes unaware of the officer, just being able to get rid of so much pent-up emotion that it makes me cry every time I see it. Adrien Brody is beyond belief, keeping his performance subtle and relying on the strength of the character and the force of the story to bring this one to life. Like I said, this movie never resorts to visual over-stimulation (although that has it's place) but still manages to give you a photographic piece of art to accompany the majesty of the film itself.

One survivor, if still of sound mind, can not have memory. And the memory \"music\" of a pianist, is very long term. The music also helps to seek, to find and hope for our hero, to forgive. So I understand. But who is our hero? His name is Wladyslaw Szpilman  Adrien Brody / is the famous pianist of the \"Warsaw Ghetto\", his talent has crossed the Polish borders. Szpilman familiar chromatic scales, those that give color; insignificant harmonica in his hands takes vivacity. Among other things, the implementation of the Study op. 10 No. 2 by Frederic Chopin, which requires a special technique of execution, not for nothing is unprepared. Moreover, our Wladyslaw, Chopin knows everything, really everything. The story goes that when Chopin composed the op. 10 No. 2, was inspired by a mouse, quickly seen running to his room. Szpilman has seen much else in his Warsaw Germans, many, \"armed in the soul\" with the most powerful poisons, HATRED. Ready for anything, to destroy everything, to \"destroy inside.\" It all began in September 1939. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 23, 1939 is a done deal. Consequence of this is the invasion and division of Polish territory by the Russians and Germans. I am the latter, the co-stars in the film directed by Roman Polanski. I said, the German planes begin bombing Warsaw at the same time, the camera captures our pianist, impassive, calm, almost disinterested in studies of Warsaw radio, while continuing to play the C # 20 Nocturno, Op posth- F. Chopin. It is 'forced' to vanish quickly when another explosion shatters all the glass panes of the studio and beyond. E ', this, the last sonata \"live\". E '1945, the \"reborn\" Polish studies, incorporate the same hands to put pressure on blacks and white keys of a piano. The piece by Chopin \"violently interrupted\" resumes its \"path\". The mind and hands of the \"survivor\" are stylistically synchronous. Chopeniani enthusiasts who have had the good fortune to listen to before the events and now are not slow to realize that the anxiety and pessimism gives way to a romance aimed at all \"to escape\" the thought and memory, while not forgetting. But what has happened in all these years to the Szpilman family, our composer, to the thousands of Polish Jews? What imparts the \"INFINITE\" circular Nazi? What are JudenrÃ¤te? What role occupies the Wehrmacht officer, Captain Wilm Hosenfeld?  Thomas Kretschmann / seen by our \"the only human being wearing the German uniform I have ever known.\" Polanski, finally finds the strength to tell and tell. In fact, the story told is an excerpt from the memoirs of Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, written after the war. The director, at the time a child is imprisoned in the Krakow ghetto. The facts narrated are not at all \"handled\". What happens in the ghetto is told without rhetoric. \"Beyond the wall,\" Jews are accomplices Jews who have grown rich on the backs of other Jews, there is a whole underwater life. But not intentionally. I think. Choosing is not easy when you find yourself alone in front of the \"certainty of death.\" He who saves a soul is as if he saved the entire universe is written in the Talmud. Wilm Hosenfeld will ever have a tree dedicated in the Garden of the Righteous in Jerusalem? And today? The Second World War is over? My answer is no. A long appendix of global tragedies following the tragic events. The man still does not learn from his mistakes. And Italy? Italy is a country at war. But who knows? And the cinema? The cinema has a duty to tell / inform, if you like. The viewer has the duty to investigate / guard, if you like. It is of free thought. And this I do not give up. \"The Pianist\" won: Two 2002 Oscar - Best Director  Roman Polanski s best actor  Adrien Brody /; Cannes Film Festival 2002 - Palme d'Or for Best Film with Roman Polanski; David di Donatello 2003 - Best foreign film with Roman Polanski.",

But it isn't meant to, people should now that what happenned was bad and should never happen again - this movie shows how bad it was, how you had to hide from nazis, how bad it was at the ghettos and all that. Yeah, maybe the main character gets lucky too much in the movie, but besides that it is still a great movie.",

Szpilman's recollections, published shortly after the war, offer, like other such books, a deeply paradoxical impression of the Holocaust. Accounts of survival, that is, are both representative and anomalous; they at once record this all but unimaginable historical catastrophe and, without intentional mendacity or inaccuracy, distort it.\r The reason for this could not be simpler. Most of the intended victims of Nazi genocide did not survive; the typical Jewish experience in 1940's Europe was death. One of the main genres that allow later generations access to this time thus presents an inevitably unrepresentative picture of it.\r We naturally identify with the protagonists of these books, and the characters based on them in movies and plays, and so imagine that we would have been among the lucky ones, even if the real odds suggest otherwise. (We also comfort ourselves in the vain belief that, had we been there, we would have bravely defied the Nazis, risking our own well-being to help their victims.) When it is not treated with the uneasy sentimentality reserved for miracles, survival — whether through dumb luck, resilience, the kindness of strangers or some combination of these — is often viewed with a deep and bitter sense of the absurd.\r Mr. Polanski, who was a Jewish child in Krakow when the Germans arrived in September 1939, presents Szpilman's story with bleak, acid humor and with a ruthless objectivity that encompasses both cynicism and compassion. When death is at once so systematically and so capriciously dispensed, survival becomes a kind of joke. By the end of the film, Szpilman, brilliantly played by Adrien Brody, comes to resemble one of Samuel Beckett's gaunt existential clowns, shambling through a barren, bombed-out landscape clutching a jar of pickles. He is like the walking punchline to a cosmic jest of unfathomable cruelty.\r Perhaps because of his own experiences, Mr. Polanski approaches this material with a calm, fierce authority. This is certainly the best work Mr. Polanski has done in many years (which, unfortunately, is not saying a lot), and it is also one of the very few nondocumentary movies about Jewish life and death under the Nazis that can be called definitive (which is saying a lot). And — again paradoxically — this is achieved by realizing the modest, deliberate intention to tell a single person's story, to recreate a specific and finite set of events. (Ronald Harwood's script does take some necessary liberties with Szpilman's account, but these seem justified by the demands of movie storytelling.)\r One of Mr. Polanski's trademarks is what might be called (to continue multiplying paradoxes) a humane sadism. He has always been fascinated by what happens to weak, ordinary people — Mia Farrow in \"Rosemary's Baby,\" for instance, or Jack Nicholson in \"Chinatown\" — when they are intruded upon by evil forces more powerful than they, and he punishes his actors, peeling back their vanity to make them show the face of humanity under duress.\r One of Mr. Brody's most appealing features — from \"King of the Hill\" 10 years ago through such varied and underseen pictures as \"Restaurant,\" \"Summer of Sam\" and \"Bread and Roses\" more recently — is his quick-witted, almost smart-alecky cockiness. His Szpilman, in the first section of \"The Pianist,\" has the gait of a self-satisfied dandy and the smug smile of a man who takes charm and good fortune as his birthright. As he plays piano in a broadcast studio, an explosion rattles the building. He ducks, wipes some plaster off his sleeve, and keeps playing. Later Szpilman refuses to allow the widespread panic at the German invasion to interfere with more pressing matters, like the seduction of a star-struck young woman named Dorota (Emilia Fox).\r Mr. Polanski, working in Poland for the first time in 40 years (and also in Prague), reconstructs the look and rhythm of life in the ghetto with care and sobriety. You feel the dread and confusion of the inhabitants, and you also observe their intuitive, futile attempts to master the situation — circulating underground newspapers, smuggling contraband through the walls and quietly arming themselves for resistance.",

This is one of them... not because it is a film about the Jewish holocaust, because there are a lot of films about that, but because of theThere are some films that are so powerful and remarkable that they remain in the collective memory. This is one of them... not because it is a film about the Jewish holocaust, because there are a lot of films about that, but because of the raw way in which it approached it, without artifice or heroism. Directed with absolute mastery by Roman Polanski - himself a Holocaust survivor, with many harsh memories of the time, some of them used here - the film seeks to mirror the personal account of the difficulties experienced by Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish pianist who worked on the radio when the Poland is invaded by Nazi Germany.I have not read the original account written by Szpilman, who would die at a time when the film was being made, but I give credit to Polanski's efforts. The director wanted a faithful, realistic and sincere account, and managed to turn his film into a historically faithful and credible portrayal of the facts and events that took place in Warsaw during the German invasion, including the occupation of the city, the forced relocation of Jews to the ghetto and transport to the extermination camps, the harsh living conditions experienced by those who lived in the ghetto and the way in which the Polish resistance and confined Jews collaborated to oppose the invaders, in a work that reached its peak with the Ghetto Revolt, suppressed with extreme violence, as we know. The pianist's story unfolds among all these facts, making Szpilman the eyewitness of all this. In the midst of absolute barbarism, dissonant notes that help us not to see reality in black and white: a Jewish police that collaborates with the Nazis by oppressing their ethnic brothers, a Polish housewife who does not hesitate to denounce that Jew that hides in the apartment next door, and a German officer who, against all odds, is willing to help him, even giving him his military coat, so he won't get cold. War and life have these things.Adrien Brody, still young, achieved with this film the most striking and powerful interpretation of his career to date. He's a great actor, he'll have a lot of opportunities to do something as good or better, but I have to admit that it's going to be difficult to give us something so powerful and intense. Next to him, we have good performances by Frank Finlay, Emilia Fox, Michal Zebrowski and Thomas Kretschmann, among other actors, all of them two or three steps below Brody.Technically, the film makes the most of the chosen filming locations in Warsaw, where filming was concentrated. The sets and costumes are loaded with detail and realism, transporting us to the time and historical context with a truly enviable rigor, worthy of a documentary. To this work, we have to associate impeccable and beautifully thought out cinematography, where light and color gradually disappear, as all the action progresses and the atrocities become more and more evident. There are also some very well executed CGI effects that take us through a city devastated by bombing and fighting. The tension and harshness of the events keep us stuck with the film until the end, and the brutality and destruction of the war are the icing on the cake. The soundtrack brings together a series of magnificent melodies by Chopin, a composer who knew how to explore the harmony and nostalgia of the piano as almost no one else knew how to do after him. Ironically or not, this Polish composer was anti-Semitic (like many people in his time), which did not prevent pianists of Jewish blood like Arthur Rubinstein from poring over his scores to the great delight of music lovers...",

This film is set in Poland during the second World War when Jews were being persecuted in the Holocaust, although many know of its horrors this movie really displays to what extent the Jews would be targeted and tortured and highlights how the suffering was universal, instead of selected the Jews who had done something wrong they are all bunched together and treated as less than human, The Pianist really does well to display this through the mood of the areas in which the movie takes place and through character development shows the corruption of the body both physically and mentally, lacking in trust and doing all it takes to survive. Despite its name, The Pianist has very little piano scores throughout the whole film played by the protagonist which makes the ones he does play even more impactful and beautiful, a man stripped of what he treasures, finally gets to enjoy it again. This movie is a real tear-jerker especially as it's based on a true story if you are interested in war this movie will shine a true and honest light on it and if you enjoy classical music in anyway this movie is definitely for you, it will bring an new and powerful connection between you and your music.",

I suppose the piano playing, if only depicted on ocassion, presents the viewer with a clear sense of the beauty that still existed by those who were otherwise forced to be labelled as among the lowest class of people in German history at that time. There's undeniably a strong poignancy there. It conveys a depiction of disintegration, on a both personal and societal level.One of the most memorable moments is depicted right at the start of the film, when said pianist (Wladyslaw Szpilman) is performing in I assume a recording studio and the impact of war based action is impossible to ignore.This is a chilling/sobering watch.
