  "critic_reviews": [
    "Rosenthal observes all the ritual elements -- a veteran of the series, he seems to understand that its fans crave certainty over shock.",
    "Director Rick Rosenthal (\"Halloween II\") seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense, relying on cliched shadows and grainy, handheld images supposedly shot by the increasingly terrified students.",
    "Like its parade of predecessors, this Halloween is a gory slash-fest. It can't escape its past, and it doesn't want to.",
    "It's all very pat and, ultimately, annoying.",
    "If, as it appears, Rosenthal is competing with the knife-wielding Myers for the title of biggest hack, he wins by unanimous decision.",
    "It seems content to plod listlessly through the motions.",
    "It's not the worst film in the series -- \"Halloween III\" will never be unseated -- but there's not nearly enough scares, or humor, to make Halloween: Resurrection worthwhile.",
    "There's no evidence of craftsmanship or energy. Everything, from the plot to the execution, is plodding and obligatory.",
    "Cheesy.",
    "Spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen, not screaming but yawning.",
    "After almost twenty five years, the Halloween series has been reduced to a false alarm. ...the characters are so devoid of human feeling they accomplish the task of making us not wish they were dead, but just gone.",
    "More uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels.",
    "It's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even \"Jason X\" - a recent attempt to prolong the rival \"Friday the 13th\" slasher franchise - look positively Shakesperean by comparison.",
    "Forget this dreck: Where's that Michael vs. Jason grudge match we've been hearing about for the last decade?",
    "Halloween: Resurrection comes closer to comatainment."

I fully understand all of the negative reviews but in my opinion Halloween: Resurrection is, in fact, one of the better editions to the series.This movie may not be the best- the characters can be quite forgettable, the story line is mediocre and the found footage cuts are of low quality and therefore unenjoyable to see on screen.

Of course that aforementioned bowel takes place in the literal lunacy of Curtis' Laurie Strode playing throughout the first ten minutes.

Not even possessing the comical and unforgettable camp of Halloween V, or the hamstrung, jarring, and butchered plot of Halloween VI, Halloween VIII ends the series with a death you've waited decades to not see.",

In fact it is a bad one and it also ruins the effect of the previous showstopper before it. That being said it is quite a bit of fun and although it's nowhere near as good as the previous film it feels more like a Halloween sequel than that one did. The film centers on a doomed reality show that happens in the Myers house on Halloween night. Of course Myers is there and systematically stalks and brutalizes the wannabe stars. Some of the entertainment is of the so bad it's good kind from Sarah shattering a glass with her powerful scream to Busta Rhymes entire performance. The kills are fun and Rick Rosenthal of 1981s Halloween II sets a decent atmosphere. Although this sequel is completely unnecessary and doesn't move the franchise forward in any way it's marginally entertaining even though it's embarrassing.",

That's pretty much the only good thing I have to say about this movie. The plot screams teen marketing (an internet-based reality show, you say?) and the execution is uninspired at best since most teens in 2002 had no concept of Carpenter's work. The movie once again ups the body count at the expense of building tension, but the death scenes do nothing whatsoever to set it apart. There's just not an original moment in this whole thing... even the opening explanation of how Michael survived H20 is laughable. But the greatest insult of all is the contrived, unceremonious way they kill off Laurie Strode within the first ten minutes, instantly turning what was billed as hers and Michael's final showdown into an undistinguished 90-minute kill-fest of disposable, undeveloped characters nobody cares about.",

Unless someone else fell down the hill, got hit with the fan and was stuck agenst the tree, just as Michael's mask landed on his face, Michael should not be here! Michael's objective in life is to kill his family, now what? He's going to go molest a bunch of teens in a house full of cameras. If you think, this movie is garbage and anyone who thinks this movie was scary, should get there balls checked, and probably reattached. ",

(or wounds her. you never know if she comes back for Halloween 9) bringing in Busta Rhymes they destroyed the rest of the movie. but for those guys who are complaining that laurie is dead.. don't be so sure yet. halloween 9 is coming out later... you never know if she comes back... and plus you have to put in perspective that Laurie's son John is alive and Jamie's baby is also out there too. so have some faith and pray that halloween puts everything together.",

To this day it's still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters Michael Myers.Which is why it is such a shame that not only are all of the sequels nowhere near as good but that the decline in quality is so drastic. Ok, the original 'Halloween' is very difficult to follow on from, but most of the sequels could at least looked like effort was made into them. 'Halloween H20' is the one exception and the fourth film is also watchable. 'Halloween: Resurrection' is the worst offender. One of the worst sequels ever, of the genre and any genre, and one of the most pointless.'Halloween H20' was a perfect place to stop the series, to have it resurrected so badly and in a way that disgraces the 'Halloween' name to intelligence insulting degrees is enough to make the blood boil. The only halfway good thing is Jamie Lee Curtis and she and her iconic character are written out in such a slap in the face way in a scene that is anything but creepy or suspenseful. Sadly that is the one scene that actually feels like it belongs in a 'Halloween' film.Curtis aside, the acting is absolutely dreadful. By far the worst acted of the sequels, yes worse than the 'Revenge...' and 'Curse...', with the embarrassment that is Busta Rhymes being the biggest offender. The entire cast of characters are far more annoying than Tina in 'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers' which is quite a feat.Laughably awful dialogue, in a script that shouldn't have been approved beyond first draft if even that, can also be found. The film is even more ineptly directed than Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers' and the non-horror scenes in 'Season of the Witch'. Visually, it is far too gimmicky that it severely gets in the way of the atmosphere.The music, after improving drastically in 'H20', is even bigger a drawback than in the fifth and sixth films, no it is no longer one of the best assets like it was in the first four films. Here it sounds cheap, goofy and just doesn't fit in placement or in tone. There is nothing remotely creepy, tense, suspenseful or even entertaining here, the deaths cause unintentional laughs, nothing creative or shocking.The atmosphere is just ruined by that, gimmicky filming, a paper thin, confusing and ridiculous story that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, terrible dialogue and acting, intelligence insulting stupidity (Rhymes versus Michael, the nadir of the entire series bar none) and erratic pacing (mostly dull).In summary, should never have been made, an unforgivably poor quality and pointless excuse of a sequel and a film. 1/10 (a rare rating for me these days but this deserves it).
