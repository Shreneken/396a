    "summary": "Alexandre Dumas's classic story of an innocent man wrongly but deliberately imprisoned and his brilliant strategy for revenge against those who betrayed him.  (Touchstone Pictures)",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "That tale gets a first-class Hallmark Hall of Fame treatment in Kevin Reynolds's swaggering The Count of Monte Cristo, which is old-form moviemaking at its best.",
        "It's a heady mix of the earnest, the grave, and the frivolous. Wizardly director Kevin Reynolds even manages to condense into a single shot, with a wisp of humor, several of the hero\u2019s long years in a dungeon without making them any less grueling.",
        "Reynolds, working in close harmony with cinematographer Andrew Dunn (Gosford Park), brings an infectious brio and an occasional sweeping grace to the classic trappings of Dumas.",
        "A lavishly mounted and appealingly old-fashioned swashbuckler with nary a trace of wink-wink irony or revisionist embellishment.",
        "This is the kind of adventure picture the studios churned out in the Golden Age -- so traditional it almost feels new.",
        "It pays homage to the genre's most glorious days.",
        "The stuff of high romance, brought off with considerable wit, too. People are going to love it.",
        "Sail to the box office, swashbucklers. Dumas is back in style.",
        "The week's guilty pleasure is The Count of Monte Cristo, a gorgeously photographed, sumptuously designed adaptation of the Dumas swashbuckler boasting the most ludicrous dialogue since director Kevin Reynolds's \"Waterworld.\"",
        "The new Count moves with the smooth, plastic efficiency of a TV miniseries. Inspiration and originality may be in short supply, but the movie gets the job done.",
        "The film tells an engaging swashbuckler on its own terms, and that's what director Kevin Reynolds has done with this old-fashioned romp of revenge.",
        "While fleeting moments from Pearce and Luis Guzm\u00e1n (as Caviezel's loyal servant) suggest the film might have been even more fun had they been allowed to loosen up a bit, the finished product still offers little cause for complaint.",
        "As a revenge thriller, the movie is serviceable, but it doesn't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions.",
        "The best thing in The Count of Monte Cristo is Guy Pearce's snot-nosed hauteur. He gives this scoundrel some wounded edges, and frills as well.",
        "For younger audiences drawn by the attractive actors, this might be their introduction to the Dumas epic. At least it's an effective and rousing version.",
        "The story stands up pretty well for a movie that's about 20 minutes longer than it ought to be, and has few of the action-beats that action-film audiences have grown accustomed to.",
        "Wolpert and Reynolds seem to be aiming for the ''Titantic'' audience at the expense of sophistication and historical relevance. It's too bad. The able cast, not to mention Alexandre Dumas, deserves better.",
        "A mediocre production that nevertheless will strike a deep and resonant chord with viewers.",
        "This is solid entertainment, and the time Caviezel and Pearce spent training for their sword fights pays off handsomely.",
        "The film's resolute indifference to fashion makes it, perhaps paradoxically, a refreshing piece of old-style entertainment, accompanied by a whooshing, trembling score by Edward Shearmur.",
        "This latest version, made with the MTV generation in mind, is arguably the least impressive of the filmed Counts.",
        "This seems to be a movie made by people who love the old classic movie swashbucklers but don't have a clue how to make or modernize them.",
        "In the end, it's a film so short on style and verve it feels lifeless; audiences might feel imprisoned in the Ch\u00e2teau d'If, praying for escape or quick death. Thankfully, one need not tunnel out of a movie theater.",
        "Revenge may be sweet, but this is one \"Monte Cristo\" that leaves a sour taste.",
        "More fun than Peter Hyams' \"The Musketeer,\" and somewhat less so than \"The Man in the Iron Mask,\" this is middling Dumas all the way.",
        "To say the film doesn't quite recapture the thrill of the novel is like saying that soda pop doesn't really have the same kick as heroin.",
        "This is the time of the year movie studios traditionally dump their mistakes into theaters -- and boy, did Disney make a whopper with The Count of Monte Cristo."

Directed by Kevin Reynolds, has a screenplay adapted by Jay Wolpert and has Jim Caviezel in the title role.This story is well known and is very good in film. Its an appealing story, with romance, good arguments for action and all that general public tends to like. Nevertheless, its not an action film, but a drama, focused on the destroyed life of a man and his thirst for revenge. The script is not brilliant, nor can we be tempted to compare it with the original book. But it does a competent job and transpose to the screen most of the major aspects of the novel, while adapting some points and bringing some new features that don't appear in the book, for dramatic purposes. In my opinion, the greatest sin of this script is the too much focus on Mondego, so that the revenge Dant\u00e9s exerts on other three conspirators is hardly explained (one of Them ends up not even appear in the film).The main actors are Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce, respectively in the role of protagonist and the main villain. Both are good investments: Pearce can be annoying with his arrogant attitude and Caviezel gives his character a certain hardness, without losing kindness and sense of justice. But this is not one of the best films of the two actors. It was shot at very attractive locations, from a visual point of view, and has good visual effects and costumes.In short: it's a good movie, which easily appeals to everyone and fulfills its role to entertain and tell a story. However, is not brilliant or particularly remarkable.",

Indeed, it's Alexandre Dumas's masterfully staged tale of retribution and duplicity that helps keep the audience on the edges of their seats, but credit should be given to the screenwriter for compressing a thousand-page book into a single, coherent, cinematic narrative. The solid direction from Kevin Reynolds also helps anchor some of the larger set pieces and action sequences down to a consistently impressive level of realism. It also helps that you have Guy Pearce playing on of the douchiest characters in literary history - Count Fernand Mondego. Pretty solid flick overall.",
