    "critic_reviews": [
        "There's no defense for movies like these, but neither do they warrant apology; they're irresistibly watchable, like car wrecks.",
        "This grim, joyless motion picture is anything but fun. It\u2019s a chore to sit through, with all the blazing, noisy pyrotechnics proving unable to lighten the mood.",
        "Kaos was apparently aiming for a coolly stylized, straight-faced take on ''Spy vs. Spy.'' As Maxwell Smart used to say, ''Missed it by that much.''",
        "Cut down to a frantic 88 minutes, you wonder if all the human moments were trimmed away to get to this abstract, humorless exercise in empty flourish.",
        "About the only fun to be had in the movie is screenwriter Alan McElroy's cartoon spook-speak.",
        "Offers the most onscreen explosions in recent memory. It's almost pornography for arsonists.",
        "The tiny, impassive-faced Liu is a disaster. She looks cute in her custom commando gear, but she's not actress enough to make Sever's ridiculous, faux hard-boiled dialogue sound like anything but the formulaic nonsense it is.",
        "I don't even care that there's no plot in this Antonio Banderas-Lucy Liu faceoff. It's still terrible!",
        "Thai director Kaos (a.k.a. Wych Kaosayananda), making his inauspicious Hollywood debut, still can't breathe any life into it. You'll just want to get back to your Game Boy.",
        "Sometimes it seems as though Hollywood can't make a decent action movie anymore. Now that's a thought to make you go ballistic.",
        "To pay for all the explosions and stunt work, the filmmakers must have decided to skimp on the screenplay. The rule of thumb is that one page of script equals one minute of movie, but there is so little dialogue in Ballistic that it could have been written on a matchbook.",
        "This is a movie in which you rarely know where you are or who's doing what to the next person.",
        "Amply demonstrates how even a movie with wall-to-wall action can be a crashing bore.",
        "Remote, non-involving and finally incomprehensible.",
        "Looks like a video-game promo, has a story that plays like the fifth episode of a struggling syndicated action show, and feels like a headache waiting to happen.",
        "To make a bad movie worse, even Ballistic's fight scenes, which ought to be the film's strong suit, are poorly edited, slice 'n' diced into incomprehensible blurs.",
        "Banderas slums through this dollar-bin action flick wearing the same look of wiped-out exasperation that Danny Glover's Sergeant Murtaugh sports in each installment of ''Lethal Weapon.'' And like Murtaugh, Banderas might be too old for this, too.",
        "The movie is a chaotic mess, overloaded with special effects and explosions, light on continuity, sanity and coherence.",
        "Zomboid, convoluted excuse for a thriller is among year's worst.",
        "You could run this film backward, soundtrack included, and it would make no less sense. --It's almost completely uninvolving, as well as being impenetrable.",
        "The film isn't even as good as the second-rate game it is based on, which is nothing but a shootout.",
        "Before seeing this film I couldn't understand why the producers had given it a subtitle; afterward I realized \"Ecks vs. Sever\" was probably the full script.",
        "This movie pulls out so many bad-action-movie cliches, you wonder if this is a how-not-to primer.",
        "Movies don't get much worse."

Sure, the third act is just a bunch of loud explosions, but Antonio Banderas is all scruffy and cute, and Gregg Henry plays a great smarmy bad guy, as usual. The criticism of Liu's acting is also way off base: she's playing an emotionless killer -- so guess what, there's not a lot to play. And actually, there are a couple of nice beats where she does reveal some vulnerability. But obviously, Kaos is not exactly an actor's director, and the script does her no favors. It's just your basic over-the-top shoot-'em-up thriller. Enjoy the nicely choreographed fight sequences and car chases, along with the always lovely Lucy Liu in bad-ass mode and call it a day.",

And it is a far, far rest that I go to that I have ever known. The soundtrack of this movie was also a high point in this already amazing movie with non-diagetic sound bursting through the speakers giving me multiple eargasms at once. And the acting, oh the acting, I must applaud the actors in this movie for their tremendous job in portraying the characters. They really become the characters and not simply act like the characters they were given. For example, the quoting by Ecks, oh dear lord that was amazing! That story about how his father gave him scars. I proudly relay the whole quote to my friends having learnt it off by heart. And the acting by Sever and his quote of how an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? Truly inspirational and amazing. This is a movie I would recommend to any friend or foe alike. PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE IT IS REALLY WORTH IT!! Yours SINCERELY,\rThe Crew from the Dark Knight.",
