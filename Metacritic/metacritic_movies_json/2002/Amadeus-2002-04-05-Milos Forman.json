  "critic_reviews": [
    "With his native Prague standing in for Vienna, Forman's images of icy beauty counterpoint the soaring music and grandstanding performances.",
    "Amadeus is a must for any music lover, any film lover, or anyone who reveres excellence.",
    "Remains the most popularly successful film ever to render the inner life of an artist.",
    "It still soars, but now it seems richer, more expansive. Amadeus reminds us that movies can be lyrical as well as vulgar, ambitious as well as playful, brilliant as well as down and dirty -- just like Amadeus himself.",
    "One of the finest qualities of Amadeus is that it reminds us of those rare occasions when an Oscar sweep is actually merited.",
    "Perfect pitch.",
    "Amadeus is about as close to perfection as movies get.",
    "In what was indisputably his finest moment as a filmmaker, Forman summoned the absolute best work of his craftsmen -- costumes, makeup, camerawork, production design -- and merged them with his own storytelling sense and his special way with actors to create what has to stand as cinema's most successful musical epic.",
    "Arguably the best motion picture ever made about the process of creation and the creator.",
    "The film is a visual feast of palaces, costumes, wigs, feasts, opening nights, champagne, and mountains of debt.",
    "Amadeus skewers the period finery - stunning costumes, production design, sublime music - with piercing intelligence and thematic gravitas.",
    "In acting terms Tom Hulce's shrieking, giggling Wolfie was easily outclassed by F Murray Abraham's brooding Iago-like villain, but Forman's distinctive central European locations, painterly night-time exteriors and period crowd scenes still look terrific.",
    "The superbly edited original version of Amadeus used overlapping sound cues for a lively flow between scenes, and the new version breaks up some of that flow with lengthy, talky interludes. Still, Ondr√≠cek's breathtaking images and Forman's essential craft are best appreciated on the big screen, and another theatrical run for Amadeus is a welcome gift, no matter how much this edition unnecessarily gilds what's already a near-perfect lily",
    "Loaded with pleasures, the greatest of which derive from the on location filming in Prague, the most 18th century of all European cities.",
    "A grand, sprawling entertainment that incites enthrallment for much of its 2 hr. 38 min.",
    "The movie is simply luxurious: huge, ornate stage settings; bright, colorful circus like street scenes; gorgeous costumes.",
    "Except for the Mozart music and Tharp movements around the edges, Amadeus plays like a monument to mediocrity. The movie belongs to Salieri.",
    "The big-screen reissue offers a rare chance to admire the marvelous production details.",
    "Mr. Forman has preserved the fascinating heart of Mr. Shaffer's play, and made it available to millions who might never enter a legitimate theater. Well done.",
    "Amadeus needs an additional 20 minutes running time like \"The Magic Flute\" needs a drum solo. Though the production is gussied up with more frills and decoration than a Viennese dessert trolley, Forman is generally workmanlike in his visual style and very uneven with his handling of actors.",
    "It binds up introductory lessons in music appreciation, Freudian psychology, and fanciful history with a pulp thriller plot.",
    "he entire cast speaks in horribly intrusive American accents, but Forman makes some perceptive connections between Mozart's life and work."

Gradually, the tone turned darker as Mozart turned inwards for inspiration, losing his boyish charm in the process. The music composed during this period was the most compelling. But his rival dogs his every step, sabotaging his success by using his influence at the court. Unlike some of the musicals which give me a headache afterwards, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, because there was ample humour and dialogue between the musical pieces. I have never enjoyed opera but here I could not get enough of it, for there is no denying that Mozart is a freaking genius. I had never had a full dosage of Mozart before I watched the movie and I'm glad I got introduced to his work in its full swing. For the naive viewer, this is a piece of fiction and you should take it like that. There is no evidence that Mozart's career turned out as it is depicted in this movie. It is based on a play by the famous Russian poet Pushkin, whose life could also do with a dramatic film.",

Amadeus is not a film about Mozart, played flamboyantly by Tom Hulce; it's a film about hisHow better to tell a story of mediocrity, the average human condition, than by telling a story of a genius through the eyes of a mediocrity? Amadeus is not a film about Mozart, played flamboyantly by Tom Hulce; it's a film about his contemporary Antonio Salieri, played by F. Murray Abraham as a sort of composer-everyman. The film's plot is largely fictional, with its earliest source in Alexandr Pushkin's 1830 Mozart and Salieri. Salieri blames God for meting out the greatest gift He could offer a composer, genius, with cruel unfairness. Salieri feels he's a devoted servant of God, via his music. But comes Mozart, in Salieri's eyes a pagan who nonetheless creates, sans effort, music Salieri knows to be genius -- this \"idle loafer\" (per Pushkin) has been granted God's gift. Salieri can't accept this injustice, and he plots Mozart's death, all the while hearing the voice of God in Mozart's art. Herein, Amadeus tackles two eternal themes in man's relationship with genius. The seeming arbitrariness of genius -- placed in select hands -- belittles ordinary men. Yet the product of genius raises ordinary men beyond the brutalities of worldly existence. Most of us are mediocrities mocked and enlightened by some form of genius we don't fully comprehend. Accordingly, Salieri's mission takes on ironic motive: \"I speak for all mediocrities in the world. I am their champion. I am their patron saint.\" Taking a step back, should genius be stamped out because it's inegalitarian by nature, or relished because it enlightens the vulgar masses of which we're a part? Director Milos Forman allows both possibilities to play out brilliantly. And from Forman there are deeper questions, as the Czechoslovakian-born director lost his parents in the Holocaust and emigrated to the U.S. when the Soviets invaded his homeland. Most specifically, does genius have the potential to save men from themselves and their worst collective impulses? At its heart, Amadeus asserts, emphatically, that it does.",

Though the accuracy of the film is certainly not 100%, it still proves to be an entertaining and informative biopics that manages to keep you wrapped up for all three hours (I saw the director's cut). F. Murray Abraham is great as Mozart's jealous rival Salieri, but to me, the real star here was Elizabeth Berridge, who plays Mozart's wife. In an innocent, vulnerable, strong, and entirely powerful performance, she manages to keep Mozart focused and keep him grounded, while also doing the same for the viewer. She is marvelous here and turns in an entirely enchanting performance. Tom Hulce, who plays Mozart, does well, but his performance is incredibly over the top and that proves to be a bit annoying at times. In no surprise, the music in the film is truly incredible and enrapturing. The production design and costume design are also top of the line. Finally, the direction from Milos Forman is grand in scale and phenomenal. This one was told quite well and really worked on multiple levels. A riveting film from beginning to end, Amadeus stands tall as a great biopic.",

But after watching it I felt something was wrong.  The central conceit of the movie - that Mozart was an enemy of Salieri is just not true and not borne out by historical record at all.  They had their differences but ultimately Salieri was a fan of Mozart and actually promoted his work.I understand that they were not aiming to make a documentary and I understand that artistic license is often necessary to create drama, but when your whole central thesis is based on a lie then it starts to fall apart.  I felt cheated.  The filmmakers created this fake drama that didn't exist in real life at all.  If you wanted to create a drama about a story like this go for it.  But to create a representation of Mozart that is nothing like the man is fraudulent and does a massive disservice to him and it feels like the drama was shoehorned in just to make a story more conflict laden.Why?  To sell more tickets?",

Murray Abraham) and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce in a daring performance).\r The costumes and settings are spot on as only great Hollywood historical dramas can pull off. (This is one place independent film doesn't hold a candle to Hollywood). With the exception of Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's wife the supporting cast is excellent (especially Jeffery Jones who plays Emperor Joseph the 2nd like Martin Sheen playing a Kennedy.)\r The plot line of an old Salieri confessing to a priest how he turned his back on God after realizing the almighty gave Mozart not himself this divine talent is a wonderful and emotionally satisfying tool to hang the plot. Salieri is a wonderful protagonist as it is easy to identify with the jealousy one feels towards those to whom talent comes so easy and seems almost squandered.\r Besides Berridge's performance there are a few minor quibbles with the film. The music is very opera heavy and not terrible representative of either Mozart's work or some of the pieces that invariably made him immortal (It's a bit like doing a biopic of Beethoven and leaving out his 5th and 9th symphonies.)\r The movie is also bit long and drags some in the middle. In one scene during the performance of The Marriage of Figaro the Emperor yawns and Salieri goes into great detail how the number of yawns affects how long the opera will run. At 2 hours 40 minutes it saying something that Amadeus only rated one yawn from myself.",

I did not love all aspects of it; e.g. only Abraham's performance really stands out from the crowd, and Hulce and Berridge are both somewhat irritating. However, it is hard not to appreciate such color and pageantry, and the tribute to Mozart's genius.  And as a work of historical fiction, it is worthy of discussion.  It is interesting to note that, like his quasi-villain Salieri, writer Peter Shaffer experienced great success in his artistic career, but is mostly forgotten today.",

Murray Abraham does a great job as SalieriFilm directed by Milos Forman released in 1984, the film shows the life of Mozart by the vision of his rival Antonio Salieri, who after an attack of madness begins to tell his story to a priest, F. Murray Abraham does a great job as Salieri old showing all the anger and envy that he has for mozart and at the same time the admiration and passion for the music of the composer. In the movie we are shown the rivalry of Salieri and Mozart and what he devised to try To end the life of the composer. Tom Hulce plays Mozart and gives a very great charisma to the character with a comical tone and a raucous laugh but who has an amazing talent about music, unfortunately in more complex works so salieri manages to fill this genius of mozart And how revolutionary he was for his time and that made him have an inevitable envy for mozart so much that he spoke that God chose mozart to be the bearer of his voice passed by his musica.entao so is shown the life of the two until death Of mozart that occurred when he was still 35 years old and even after his death we see that salieri is not happy to feel jealous of his sins against mozart. A great and very well-made workmanship, a great photograph and a perfect soundtrack with mozart and salieri compositions, the costumes and the ambiance are perfects and instantly remembers the time in which the film pass.In general amadeus is great movie that tells a good biographical history (even if it is not true, it is said that salieri and mozart were friends and salieri was more famous than mozart in his time) .with sure a great request for lovers of classical music And mozart itself.note 100",

It is rich on technical aspects like costume design, production design, background score, make-up design and editing. The script is elaborate, satisfying and justified thoroughly through the complex character's perspective whose narration is the window of writer where it can be and is brutally honest and clears up all that is hoax and distraction. Peter Shaffer; the writer, has done an appreciative work on writing this finely detailed script that is full of tactics but is surpassed by its brilliant execution by Milos Forman whose work pays off well in here. The performance objective is scored majestically by F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce, in their parallel role are doing some of their best work. The build up to the scrutiny of the politics in here is the key that is developed well enough to lure the audience in. Amadeus dances on the beat rhythmically and stay true to the tone of the feature for around 160 minutes, which doesn't happen often.",

It's an epic of one-sided rivalry about the dangers of envy, obsession, and devotion to craft over your own wellness entirely filled with beautiful classical music that is made surprisingly accessible by the characters' descriptions of it out of their own appreciation for it.

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nI recently watched this movie. I personally have nothing against these types of dramas. However, I was holding myself back from ripping out my hair when the goofball antagonist was smooth-talking and manipulating everyone. I hate the plot contrivances in this movie like when the antagonist pays a maid to work at Mozart's house and he never questions it and then somehow someone finds out about what his play is about when he wouldn't even let his own father look at the play before it was finished. After the emperor confronts him about it he questions it once, is told that he can't ask the emperor questions, and then just never touches on it again. Also, really weird when half of everyone has American or English accents and they're **** on each other about being from different countries. Like in the beginning the emperor is skeptical about inviting Mozart over because he's German but literally everyone is just speaking English. Pretty much all the drama comes from people not simply saying \"oh yeah, that dude Salieri payed me to be here\" or realizing any time Mozart needs to communicate with the emperor it literally goes from Mozart to Salieri and then Salieri just **** on Mozart behind his back. I get that it's possible, just annoying when it's so painfully obvious and Mozart never even questions it. Not even to himself personally. He just assumes everyone is out to help. Also he has a stupid giggle that I wanted to know what 'accurate', thankfully it isn't.",
