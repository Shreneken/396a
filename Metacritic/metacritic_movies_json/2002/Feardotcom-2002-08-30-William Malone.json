    "summary": "A brash young police detective (Dorff) joins forces with a beautiful, ambitious Department of Health researcher (McElhone) to find the answers behind the mysterious deaths of four people who each died 48 hours after logging on to the Internet site Feardotcom.  (Warner Bros.)",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Strange, how good feardotcom is, and how bad. The screenplay is a mess, and yet the visuals are so creative this is one of the rare bad films you might actually want to see.",
        "There's potential here for a macabre cult favourite touching on themes of technology and the body-mind split, but the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase \"fatal script error.\"",
        "Never quite realizes its potential to evoke the real horror of the Internet -- Yet, Malone has given the film a distinctive atmosphere and occasional flashes of his perverse sense of humor.",
        "As scary and minor-chord heavy as FearDotCom can be, there's no big payoff, no logical resolution.",
        "There's a germ of an interesting idea here, but it's smothered by gloomy cinematography a la \"Seven\" (1995) and grating implausibilities, like the fact that everyone lives in the kind of cavernous, dankly art-directed dumps that only internet millionaires and trust fund twinkies can afford in the real New York.",
        "The story is a mess, some of the images offensive, the acting under par and the dialogue silly.",
        "The film squanders every opportunity (and international-coproduction cent) on by now imitative Nine Inch Nails-video-style visual Goth-goo, and, scarily, forgets to input a plot or script that makes any sense.",
        "A low-rent, slow-witted horror flick notable chiefly for its hilariously unsuccessful attempt to pass off Luxembourg City as New York City.",
        "Made with just enough craft to keep it from being the instantly dated camp howler its title promises, but it's quickly apparent that there's no thought or originality under its grim, familiar surface.",
        "Would have made a hell of a short -- but falls flat on its hyperstylized face as a feature.",
        "I feel guilty and somehow unclean. And all I did was watch it.",
        "Shameless exercise in high-tech sadism.",
        "The film, whose clumsy editing and dearth of establishing shots keep the viewer in an unintended state of confusion, is a corpse in its own right: It\u2019s filled with the rotting ideas of far better movies.",
        "A depraved, incoherent, instantly disposable piece of hackery.",
        "It is painful to watch an actor as skillful as Mr. Dorff reduced to delivering flat repetitive dialogue that would make any actor look foolish.",
        "This movie is plain stupid from the get go, but at least it looks good.",
        "The story leapfrogs abruptly from scene to scene, and it makes such a mockery of narrative logic and continuity that the cast tends to look either baffled (Dorff) or as if they're trying to remain unrecognized.",
        "The film is a failure in just about every way, save for its acting, which is adequate."

I don't think I've seen a movie this lame since One Missed Call. FeardotCom follows two detectives, Mike and Terry, who investigate a series of murders that all link back to the awkwardly named feardotcom.com. If you visit the site, you die in 48 hours unless you can solve its mystery. Sound familiar? This movie is a complete rip-off of The Ring, except this has a two day time limit instead of a week, and it's a haunted website instead of a videotape. The \"big reveal\" at the end is incredibly similar to the one in The Ring, which makes this a very predictable thriller. Somehow, despite the fact that this \"thriller\" has so many inconsistent and just plain stupid twists, it managed to still bore me to tears. Everything about FeardotCom is so pathetic and lazy, from the laughable writing to the mediocre acting, that there just isn't anything to enjoy about this almost infuriatingly insipid film.",
