    "summary": "Robert Ludlum's international thriller gets an edgy 21st century spin from director Doug Liman.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "A first-rate thriller with grit and intrigue to spare.",
        "Blisteringly fast, Bourne also has a strong or striking supporting actor around every corner: Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, Julia Stiles and Clive Owen in roles that range from meaty to amazingly small.",
        "One of those rare thrillers where the cops aren't fools, villains don't turn stupid at crucial moments, and career assassins seldom miss targets.",
        "Somehow the movie works like a clock. Its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar, but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and, at the same time, is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time.",
        "The full-throttle approach of director Doug Liman (Swingers, Go) is impressive.",
        "There isn't a dull or dumb moment in this movie.",
        "The result is an escapist fantasy that is -- Damon's and Potente's persuasive performances aside -- as weightless and inconsequential as a musical. And at the moment every bit as welcome.",
        "The movie is a generic paranoid espionage fantasy, but its proportions are refreshingly correct. It moves quickly, adroitly, and without fuss.",
        "This is an entertainment that really entertains because any number of interesting and unexpected choices were made, starting with the selection of Doug Liman as the director.",
        "Entertaining, handsome and gripping, The Bourne Identity is something of an anomaly among big-budget summer blockbusters: a thriller with some brains and feeling behind it, more attuned to story and character than to spectacle.",
        "The Bourne Identity, like its hero, triumphs through sheer unreflective professionalism. It is, by today's standards, a modest thriller, with a self-contained storyline and with very few big special effects.",
        "Like its protagonist, it never hands you explanations on a silver platter, and it makes you think a bit, something far too few thrillers do these days.",
        "Liman packs enough firepower into The Bourne Identity to please the summer action fan, including a reshot climax that contains one of the niftier stunts I've seen recently. The centerpiece action sequence is a bravura car chase through Paris, yet the moments that bookend it are equally impressive.",
        "The result is not only entertaining but also refreshing, a shameless crowd-pleaser with a healthy cynicism about itself.",
        "A skillful action movie about a plot that exists only to support a skillful action movie. The entire story is a set-up for the martial arts and chases. Because they are done well, because the movie is well-crafted and acted, we give it a pass. Too bad it's not about something.",
        "Nicely paced and fits the bill for those in search of two hours of spy-based action and martial arts. The movie has credibility issues, but none are insurmountable in the name of entertainment.",
        "Damon, starring in his first full-fledged action pic, brings a determined bearing and believability to the proceedings.",
        "Though it's clearly meant to be character-driven, the movie is thrown out of whack by a total lack of chemistry between the leads, and some great acting (Clive Owen, Chris Cooper, Brian Cox) on the side.",
        "Director Doug Liman -- the hip skipper of \"Swingers\" and \"Go\" -- makes all the familiar dirty business seem fun and almost human. In these dog days, Bourne earns what passes as high praise: It doesn't suck.",
        "A lean, deftly shot, well-acted, weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s European-set spy pictures. There are even moments when you hope it could turn into a modern \"Charade.\"",
        "The problems with Damon's character are the problem with the movie: It's about plot mechanics, not heart and soul.",
        "This savvy adaptation of Robert Ludlum's action-clogged 1980 bestseller benefits from the fact that the filmmakers were smart enough to throw out most of the book's preposterous spills and thrills and concentrate instead on its intriguing central character.",
        "May be a bloodless piece of thriller craftsmanship, but at a time when craft has become negligible, its efficiency and whipcrack timing are increasingly uncommon virtues.",
        "As for Damon, this may not be a performance so much as an appearance. But he cares so utterly, it works.",
        "Makes one interested in seeing the inevitable sequel, but one is also left to somewhat question the worth of sitting through this first installment.",
        "It has a few whispers of intrigue, but at the heart of The Bourne Identity lies a dispiriting paradox: The more that Jason Bourne learns about himself, the less arresting he seems.",
        "Films borrow tricks from pictures made years ago -- try to watch Bourne without thinking of \"The Manchurian Candidate.\"",
        "Next time Damon will have to find a worthier vehicle. As the intended start of a franchise, The Bourne Identity is a bit of a bust.",
        "All this is diverting but also borderline dull.",
        "Banal big-budget adaptation of Robert Ludlum's 1980 espionage thriller.",
        "The best audiences can hope for is that they, too, get amnesia and forget they ever saw this movie."

The mysterious nature of the film and its protagonist really help it to become different than your classic spy movie. However, it still is a spy movie, right down to the over-the-top European location. This does not mean it is not a good spy movie, however. Endlessly entertaining with brilliant action set pieces, added in with the twists and turns of every good spy movie, The Bourne Identity really does it job well. Mat t Damon, Franka Potente, and Chris Cooper, are all very good in their roles and it is no surprise as to why this one exploded the way it did. Overall, very satisfied.",

The pacing is perfect, with no fillers but just under 2 hours of epicness. The balance between action and story, suspense and cinematic scenes is perfect. The story is very easy to follow, it's direct, intriguing and filled with great voice acting from Matt Damon and almost perfect direction. There's not a single moment in this film where you are not immersed. You don't want to take your eyes off it, whereas a lot of action films tend to go for all-out explosions and miss out on the story. You can switch on and comeback to it later and still enjoy, like the Transporter films, but this one is so gripping and almost perfect in every way. All it's really missing is a bit more action and scenes to go in between - basically a tiny bit longer. On the whole it's a must watch.",

The film follows the story of Jason Bourne (Damon), an amnesiac desperately attempting to discover more about his true identity while simultaneously embedding himself in a convoluted conspiracy involving the CIA. Now, when I had first heard \"The Bourne Identity\"'s fairly original and intriguing premise, I was already expecting this movie to be great. Did it disappoint? No. No, it did not. This is one of those movie's that just cannot fail - it has a rock solid story crafted by one of the most intelligent authors of our time, a brilliant screenplay written by one of Hollywood's most sought after screenwriters, and an intensely entertaining lead performance. \"The Bourne Identity\" and it's sequels are often credited with setting the par for most spy thrillers of the past decade - Does it deserve that credit? I believe so, for I have seen a multitude of films with similar concepts that have come out since \"The Bourne Identity\"'s release. However, most, if not all, of the movies that have tried to replicate what The \"Bourne\" movie's have done, cannot reach the level of intrigue that each of the \"Bourne\" movies have reached - and they promptly fall flat in comparison. That being said, everything about this film, beit it's fighting sequences, it's car chase, or it's intense cinematography has made an impact on the spy thriller genre, and the modern film industry, as a whole. All in all, I felt that \"The Bourne Identity\" was an intensely entertaining thriller with a large amount of intelligence clearly woven it.",

Another movie would have slick cars and immaculately groomed cast members who would be CG'd through their fight scenes. Here, so much of what you see feels genuine that it's easier to fall into, and easier to like the characters, for what they are. Damon in fits particularly well into the role of amnesiac assassin Jason Bourne. Once the action kicks in it doesn't try to reach the bar that The Matrix or X-Men set, but rather follows a more realistic, but still entertaining kind of action. And because it's unafraid to be what it is, it's its own kind of cool. If you have this is one hand and another action flick in the other, do yourself a favor and pick this.",

A body of a man is found floating in theThough it's not quite the incredible film critics were making it out to be, The Bourne Identity manages to entertain the whole way through, and it's hard to imagine someone being bored during the film. A body of a man is found floating in the ocean. This man has no idea who he is, who he was, or anything about his past. His ability to speak many different languages and provide detailed summaries about surroundings and people by just glancing at them suggests he was part of something big. Turns out, his name is Jason Bourne. And he's an assassin, and a good one. But now, he's on the run with the girl, in order to figure out more about his past, and not die. As I watched the film, I was constantly reminded of another action film I saw recently: The Fugitive. The Fugitive was a 90's film with Harrison Ford, who plays a man named Richard Kimble, falsely charged with the murder of his beloved wife. He escapes prison, and is on the lam. There are many reasons why The Fugitive is better than The Bourne Identity. For one, The Fugitive is more emotionally involving. We care about Dr. Kimble, and we feel his loss. The Bourne Identity offers no reason for us to care about any of the characters, so it's hard to root for either side. Also, The Fugitive is much more frantic. Dr. Kimble's race from the cops never really stops until the very end. Jason Bourne stops every so often, as if to take a breather from the action. We don't feel the thrill with The Bourne Identity, like we did with The Fugitive (and the generic chase scenes don't help). The film lacks smarts as well. The Fugitive was a nice little mystery alongside an action movie, but The Bourne Identity requires little thinking. We learn Jason Bourne's main role within half an hour. But The Bourne Identity isn't as bad as I'm making it out to be. There's lots of action. Maybe even more so than The Fugitive. There's gun fights, and fist fights. There's some exciting (and somewhat unrealistic) escape scenes as well. The film also benefits from a solid cast. Never for a minute will you question a lack of quality in the performances. Matt Damon provides a frustrated man who lost his memory. Franka Potente acts convincingly as an even more confused and worried Marie Kreutz, who wants nothing more then to get out of this mess. The rest of the cast is equally strong. I usually don't comment about the score in action films because they're usually very run-of-the-mill. This one was a little bit better than that, but the over-powering drums keep me from praising it too much. The main flaw with The Bourne Identity, however, was it's lack of a final fight. No cinematic duel to the death. In The Fugitive, we had a manic fight/hide-and-seek/out wit game going, that was heart-pounding. We get no such thing in The Bourne Identity, which surprised me, considering the fact that this was in fact, a movie about action. The Bourne Identity is perfect for teenage boys. It's fun, it's got some good action scenes, and a strong cast. It entertains from start to finish. It does suffer from problems though, such as a lack of thrill, no cinematic duel, and no need to think. But in the end, good outweighs the bad, and I'm ready for the sequel.",

The basic premise, a man in search of his own identity, could allow the script to have some mystery that would sweeten this recipe and make the film more interesting. However, after seeing the film, I feel that this is not exactly what I found and the film took little advantage of this idea.The script starts off well, as I said: a man wakes up not knowing who he is, but quickly starts behaving like a \"killing machine\". It's instinctual. It becomes evident to us there that he was, or is, a professional killer hired by someone. Furthermore, it remains to be seen what the details of his story will be, and it is this quest that leads the film, from one pursuit to another until the end. The problem with this movie really starts with a sparse script: the man doesn't know who he is and everyone wants to kill him, so he has to flee almost the entire movie, between gunfire and bombs. It's simple, and it's tiring.Matt Damon achieved, with this film and its sequels, a consecration as an actor that is deserved, albeit uninteresting. He is a good actor, but in this film he was far from his potential and the film, due to its characteristics, does not favor the work of an actor who wants to stand out for the quality of his dramatic interpretation. Still, the film gives him enough to do a satisfying job, and still allows to some supporting actors a certain leeway to show talent. This is the case of Franka Potente, Clive Owen and Chris Cooper. The rest of the cast shows up just because they have to and doesn't stand out.Technically, the film has many positive and well-developed aspects. Being a pure action film, there are high production values and a lot of money invested in great and quality effects. Gunshots, explosions, smashed cars, things that explode, fake blood, the film is a godsend for the visual, special and sound effects team. The work of action stunts is also important and worthwhile. Cinematography takes a back seat, with discreet but competent work, and the soundtrack, by John Powell, plays its part, with an especially good and striking song in the end credits: \"Extreme Ways\", by Moby.",
