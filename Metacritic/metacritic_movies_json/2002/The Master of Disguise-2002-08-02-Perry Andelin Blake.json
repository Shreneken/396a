  "summary": "Dana Carvey is Pistachio Disguisey, the last in a long line of \"masters of disguise\" in a family that goes back through 2,000 years of European history.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Feels like nothing less than Dana Carvey's desperate bid for his own \"Austin Powers\"-like franchise, but with a harmless humor far less crude. Carvey favors whoopee cushion punch lines to toilet gags and references to big butts over sexual double-entendres.",
    "A disjointed film that, but for brief flashes of comedic verve, should skip theatrical release and go straight to video.",
    "Totally lame.",
    "Pants and wheezes and hurls itself exhausted across the finish line after barely 65 minutes of movie, and then follows it with 15 minutes of end credits in an attempt to clock in as a feature film.",
    "Lacking even a hint of humor or a watchable story, Disguise has distinguished itself as the summer's worst movie.",
    "The individual scenes are just random, uninspired riffs by Carvey or awkwardly flat cameos by the likes of Jesse Ventura and Olympic sprinter Michael Johnson.",
    "At times, it actually hurts to watch.",
    "Like criticizing the light fixtures on the Titanic. This ship was going down anyway.",
    "For a movie that's all about camouflage, this sketch comedy epilogue turns out to be its most creative disguise: a thin coating of humor slapped on an otherwise ponderous film.",
    "Quite an artful dissembler. Despite all evidence to the contrary, this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie, the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on TV and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults.",
    "Imagine combining bad imitations of the \"Ace Ventura\" and \"Austin Powers\" movies and you'll have a rough idea of this feeble Dana Carvey farce.",
    "Vehicle for Dana Carvey as a chameleonic crime-fighting imbecile is noisy, colorful and fart-gag-filled enough to amuse undiscriminating auds under the age of 10.",
    "Painfully unfunny and misguided to boot.",
    "A film so family-safe it feels sheathed in plastic Bubble Wrap. Unfortunately, it's not even as much fun as popping the bubbles. It doesn't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes. It still feels like a prison stretch.",
    "An awful, stillborn comedy assembled out of rusty spare parts from secret agent movies and run-of-the-mill ''Saturday Night Live'' skits.",
    "Even the rare individual who died laughing while watching the trailer will discover that only half of that phrase - the \"dying\" part - applies to the experience of enduring the film.",
    "I understand how hard it is for parents to find movies to take their kids to, but the thought of them or their children getting stuck at this stinker galls me. Summer vacation feels short enough as it is.",
    "But even Carvey's protean talent can't dent this ponderously unfunny and uninspired comedy. It's hard to imagine anyone older than 10 being diverted by its broad buffoonery, and kids deserve better than this in the first place.",
    "A film about as funny as a seeping wound.",
    "The Master of Disguise represents Adam Sandler's latest attempt to dumb down the universe.",
    "No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise, an unbearably tedious and unfunny comedy.",
    "A gimmick in search of a movie: how to get Carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible, plot mechanics be damned."

The turtle guy is always the one that's marketed the most. He looks and acts completely retarded. The whole movie is just a cluster of the worst jokes imaginable. Some people say it's so bad it's good, and I'll respect that because that still means it's a bad movie.
