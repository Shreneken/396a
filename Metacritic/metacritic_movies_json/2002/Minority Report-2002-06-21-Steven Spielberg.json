  "rating": 7.0,
  "release_date": "2002-06-21",
  "summary": "Based on a story by famed science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, Minority Report is and action-detective thriller set in Washington, D.C. in 2054, where police utilize a psychic technology to arrest and convict murderers before they commit their crime.  (Fox/Dreamworks)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "This is the kind of pure entertainment that, in its fullness and generosity, feels almost classic.",
    "May show both director and star working at their professional peaks, but I don't think it's as good as that underappreciated masterwork \"A.I.\" It's not as resonant and daring, not as full of magic and marvel. Spielberg stretches himself technically here but not emotionally.",
    "A heart-pounding experience that makes you think and contains a gallery of characters that will haunt your nightmares for years to come.",
    "It affirms that, even in the 2000s, movies do not have to be brain-dead to be exciting. When the season is over, Minority Report will more than likely stand out as the best picture to grace multiplex screens during the Summer of 2002.",
    "This film is such a virtuoso high-wire act, daring so much, achieving it with such grace and skill. Minority Report reminds us why we go to the movies in the first place.",
    "Stripped of all bravado, Cruise delivers a raw and probably detractor-proof performance. Spielberg does what he did right in creating a novel milieu for \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence,\" but this time the writing is fresher and anything but unwieldy.",
    "A happy surprise: a timely antidote to the comic-book mindlessness of \"Spider-Man\" and repetitive space fantasy of \"Star Wars,\" and an encouraging bid from the top of the A-list to once again reach very high and spit in the face of the gutless formula filmmaking that rules Hollywood.",
    "Few directors are capable of marrying ideas and entertainment—one is often sacrificed for the other—but Spielberg peppers one gripping action setpiece after another with trenchant details about a near-future robbed of the most basic freedoms and privacy.",
    "It's a dark and dazzling spectacle.",
    "Where Minority Report succeeds is by dishing up a little bit of everything – to see no one leaves the theater disgruntled. There are helpings of science fiction marvel, there’s some interminable tension and a real human story underneath it all. The specials effects are damn impressive to boot.",
    "Terrifically entertaining specimen of Spielbergian sci-fi, incomparably better than \"A.I.\" and as dark a movie as the director has made since \"Schindler's List.\"",
    "This is a fiendishly complicated whodunit -- or, to be more precise, a who-done-what-to-whom-and-when -- told within the confines of thoughtful, speculative science-fiction.",
    "The film moves swiftly and unerringly to its conclusion. Spielberg remains under Stanley Kubrick's directorial spell.",
    "The most compelling question dangling at its end is, \"Didn't Steven Spielberg used to know how to bring a movie to an end?\"",
    "Spielberg takes assured control. In his hands, Minority Report is a classy, chilly quasi-Hitchcockian affair.",
    "The first 20 minutes are masterful, as Cruise hunts down a killer-to-be; the last 20 are mediocre, as screenwriters Scott Frank and Jon Cohen untangle the mystery they've grafted onto Dick's story. In between lies a conventional but expertly realized cop-on-the-run drama.",
    "Spielberg's dark side may not be where everyone wants to live, but it's somehow encouraging to know that he has one.",
    "May be a shade too serious and contemplative to completely enchant the thrill-seeking masses, while simultaneously seeming too mainstream-minded and genre-bound to be entirely embraced by highbrows.",
    "It's not the crowning achievement in Steven Spielberg's oeuvre, but Minority Report stands on its own sturdy sci-fi legs, and there's no sign of that little imp Haley Joel Osment, to boot, thankfully.",
    "Taut entertainment that juggles brainy ideas about perception, predetermination and free will - and drops things in a messy third act where the vintage noir gets bathed in a bit too much Spielbergian glow.",
    "Cruise will never be a master thespian, but there's no one better at putting across the charisma of control, and the opening sequence of ''Report'' is an astonishingly fluid demonstration of his gifts.",
    "Its most vivid scenes -- a visit with an insane ophthalmologist, a showdown at Anderton's supposed crime scene -- have the kind of anything-goes creativity that set \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\" apart from the crowd last year.",
    "The mechanical beauty and android possibilities of the future excite the filmmaker, and that's where Minority Report becomes an alluring postcard from the edge. But it's an edge over which Spielberg never seems to want to step.",
    "Whose idea was it to turn Minority Report into a mushy declaration of humanism? It ends up as less of a warning about an Orwellian police state than a protest that Pre-Cogs are people, too. It's Dick-less.",
    "Though he can still deliver an amazing scare, Mr. Spielberg's interest now leans more toward exposition rather than the anticipatory. He is explaining the fun away.",
    "One of the glummest and most forbidding thrillers ever.",
    "It's not the kind of work that wins awards, but without Cruise's intensity almost willing our interest in Spielberg's unrelentingly dark world, Minority Report wouldn't have nearly as much life as it does.",
    "More humdrum than horrible. It isn't futuristic film noir; it's just everyday film beige.",
    "We'll never know what might have been, as eye candy and food for thought replace real thrills in the cool but cold Minority Report.",
    "Miscast, misguided, and often nonsensical, Minority Report is nevertheless the most entertaining, least pretentious genre movie Steven Spielberg has made in the decade since \"Jurassic Park.\"",
    "Give Steven Spielberg some dinosaurs or a cute, funny alien and he'll spin populist sci-fi till the Arcturan cows come home. Give him a philosophical story about technology changing what it means to live in this world and he'll craft a hodgepodge of shallow and unexplored ideas."

Seriously i was not expecting much from this movie, but I was wrong, as it turned out to be a \"mature\" science fiction movie. I liked how Mr. Spielber presented 2054 A.D. (Even if He was too optimistic I am afraid...), where \"Pre-Cogs\" predict crimes beforehand. This whole \"Pre-cog\" method of peacekeeping, and it use in more and more places every day, raise interesting ethical questions. Is the person really guilty if he/she has not committed  the crime yet, because \"Precrime\" arrested him/her based on the prediction of \"Pre-cogs\"? Are \"Pre-cogs\" infallible? What if they make mistakes sometimes? Is If they do make mistakes, is it worth it for the greater good? Is it ethical to keep \"Pre-cogs\" sedated and placed in a room in their whole life to serve the law, basically taking away they chance to a normal life? These are some of the questions the movie ask from the viewer, while the plot unfolds. The movies main plot is also interesting and keep you seated the whole run time. It is about John Anderton who heads Precrime, and believes the system's flawlessness. However one day the \"Pre-cogs\" predict that Anderton will commit a murder himself in the next 36 hours. Anderton decides to get to the mystery's core by finding out the 'minority report' which means the prediction of the female \"Pre-cog\" Agatha that \"might\" tell a different story and prove Anderton innocent. I can only recommend the movie. It has some interesting twist and turns. Tom Cruise's character is layered and the actors all did a great job in their roles.",

You have very dark moments followed immediately by cute vignettes. It didn't jive well for me. The special effects are beautiful yes; they usefully serve to distract you from the horribly convoluted plot. In an ironic twist, the movie includes far more subplots and \"gotchas\" than the original text. One thing I didn't really care for about the visuals, though, is the bizarre use of color. I found it rather disturbing and oddly reminiscent of Gladiator's butchering of color. The ending, to use a borrowed phrase, is \"spielberged\". It would have been fine, had the movie finished about a half-hour before it actually did. If you've seen it, then you know what I'm talking about; if you haven't then I don't really want to spoil it for you. Lastly, I feel as though Phil Dick ought to be rolling in his grave over this movie. The \"take home\" message of the movie is diametrically opposed to that of the short story on which it's based. This would almost be ok (but not really), if I had agreed with the movie more, but I don't. If you think I'm some kind of purist that just doesn't like screen adaptations, you'd be right. But in this particular case, I saw the movie first; in fact, I hated the movie so much I almost didn't bother with the short story.",

Great special effects, very good acting/casting, and that unique Spielburg style directing you don't see anywhere else. I took one point off because of the ending, as someone before me said, was just too narrated, or forced, as some of Spielburgs movies are. It would've been better if they just let the movie end directly after the climax, instead of having Cruise explain what happened afterward. The other point I took off was because, although the movie is a great thriller, it does seem to lack action, or freshness, after you've seen it. But, as long as you don't \"overwatch\" it to keep the movie fresh, I'd really recommend buying this. Awesome movie...",

The overall tone of people's lives in 2054 is hopelessly murky. Director Steven Spielberg uses his tremendous skill as a prodigious technical director to bring jaw-dropping action sequences to life here, not to mention his dead-on ability to emulate the tense atmosphere of classic film noir, now blended with what can be described as a touch of realistic fantasy. The screenplay is mundane at best, though, for there are a couple of weak plot twists which end up causing a feeling of not enough innovation when it comes to building a relevant plot. This 102 million dollar thriller did not amaze audiences, afterall. Either because these people considered it too distant and dark as an escapist entertainment or, probaby, they simply disassociated it from those big, generic summer blockbusters. Mr. Spielberg achieved a slightly pretentious, enormously nice-looking motion picture, but not a particulary memorable one, so to speak. It ultimately lacks some depth and substance. As a Spielberg film, \"Minority Report\" can easily be labelled as average only. If compared to similar flicks, it is definetely above average.",

The plot twists were careful enough not to tie you in knots, but remembered the audience knew that it was a science-fiction thriller, and ended up creating something intelligent and mind-blowing at the same time.

Tom Cruise stars in his role as John Anderton, lead officer in Washington, D.C.'s pre-crime division set in the mid-21st century. \"Pre-crime\" is a concept that revolves around the ability to stop murders before they happen thanks to three \"precogs\" and their ability to see into the future. This is an inherently controversial way to 'solve' crime but is largely accepted because it seems perfect considering that no murders had been committed in the six year experiment. The conflict is introduced when Cruise finds out that he is the next expected murderer. This puts him on the run from the division he once led and on an investigation to find out how he is supposedly going to murder someone he's never met. The action isn't overdone but rather placed well throughout the film. The combat sequences could've been better but they were still enjoyable. A few of the plot points were a little weak also but there weren't actual holes or anything. The acting was solid with Cruise and a supporting cast of Colin Farrell and Max von Sydow among others. The best part of the film, though, was the interesting plot. Even with the few weak parts it's just a very interesting story that develops nicely. Many movies struggle with the concept of the future being predicted but Minority Report does a great job and is very entertaining.",

Dick and when you read his name, you probably just snickered. He might not have had an easy childhood with a name like that and you may not recognize his name, but he is to Science Fiction what Stephen King is to Horror. The films Blade Runner, Total Recall, Screamers, Paycheck, A Scanner Darkly, Next, & The Adjustment Bureau were all based on stories or books that he wrote. Minority Report is yet another of his stories developed for the big screen and one of the most popular. This ingenious film was Directed by Stephen Spielberg and starred Tom Cruise. I am by no means a fan of Tom Cruise, in fact, I've made it a point over the last few years to avoid seeing anything he is in, but this was one film I couldn't miss. To his credit Cruise was very good and exciting throughout, showing a lot of charisma, it was unexpected, but a welcome change from what we normally see from him. This terrific futuristic tale tells the story of pre-crime, a system in which high functioning autistics can predict murders with a very narrow margin of error. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the lead investigator, whose job it is to stop these crimes before they happen. Things are going well for him, that is until his name comes out of the machine and he becomes a target of his own men. The story was deep, yet somewhat complicated, as I was confused at several points in the movie, but that's how you know it's good Science Fiction. The action and chase sequences were fantastic, as was the direction and special effects. The story does however leave some lose ends and I found the precogs to be more than somewhat creepy. It almost seemed like these disabled people were being abused for their unique abilities and not a single character in the film had any issues with that. Minority Report is a long, complex story, but it's fast paced, visually impactful, and will make you think. It only took thirty years, but you can finally add a Tom Cruise film to the list of movies I enjoyed.",

In addition, the special effects are well done and the story, though slow forming, is very well put together and engrossing. However, on the negative side, the first half is iffy for me. As we are introduced to this futuristic world with no murders, the explanations and presentation of everything is spotty at best, leaving the viewer a tad confused and, at times, bored. However, once you finally wrap your head around everything, the film really takes off. I never really thought the \"action\" sequences were phenomenal, but otherwise, everything really began to click and the film had a very exciting and tense conclusion.",

Dick, Steven Spielberg's \"Minority Report\" was an incredibly interesting experience. I'd have to say that this film is easily one of the best science fiction films of the 2000s. The overall premise of the movie is really novel as well as provocative, and all the performances help to ...tell this complex narrative with great intensity. The film's story also delves into some very complex literary topics, such as: determinism vs. free-will, legality vs. politics, and Self-perception. One of my favorite aspects of the film is the way it's shot. In terms of lighting, Spielberg used a deep contrast between lights and darks which really helps to give the film a sort of a badass neo-noir feel. Spielberg also bleach-bypassed the negatives of the film in order to desaturate the colors of overlit scenes. Both of these technical aspects helped to achieve the very unique visual style that this movie has to offer - I style that I found relevant to the rest of the movie's tone. In terms of action, there's a pretty good shovelful of these really badass set pieces that Spielberg is known best for. Also, Spielberg reunites with John Williams to create yet another amazing soundtrack. My only problem with the movie was the ending. While it was pretty uplifting, I didn't really think it fit the tone of the rest of the movie. However, it doesn't take away from the film in any way - I still enjoyed the movie immensely and a happy ending never hurts. Anyway, in the end, I think that \"Minority Report\" was a near seamless film that was as interesting as it was aesthetic, and fun.",

In this case the insistent flash-bang-whiz helps to make up the deficit, as the viewer has no time to reflect on how bizarre and silly much of the story is.  So watch and enjoy the spectacle, but don't worry too much about holes in the plot or cookie-cutter characters.  A few barely functioning psychics float in a pool at police headquarters, and occasionally they get a vision of a murder about to take place, which results in a wooden ball rolling down a chute and into the hands of detective John Anderton, who quickly tries to locate and then shut down the crime before it can happen.  John has issues of his own, such as drug use, the disappearance of his young son, and the subsequent collapse of his marriage.  Then one day Anderton himself is fingered by the \"pre-cogs\" and he has to go on the lam and try to figure out who is out to get him and why.  This leads to a few plot twists and an unconvincing wrap-up.  But there are enough memorable moments - such as Anderton being followed by video ads in a shopping mall, a scientist and her amazing, moving plants, and mechanical spiders that invade an area on behalf of the police and identify people by shining a beam into their eyes - to make this an exciting ride.",

And I didn't even check about the name of the director until I watched it though... in 2018.Having said that, the relevance of the story Minority Report tells is not going to lose relevance anytime soon. The story of human error creeping, creating and destroying justice systems that are supposed to help people and the story of people far too ambitious and fame-hungry to ever see the right choice through. It is a timeless story of the inevitability of choice. There is nothing unpredictable about the how it would come to for Captain John Anderton but the way the narrative is driven till that penultimate final confrontation suffices far too well for it be a bother. The highlight of this all is Pre-Cog Agatha's fated monologue about the future of a child that was lost to human cruelty of a more subtle nature.If there is one thing that bothered me, it was Anderton having a last chance to take down the mastermind behind this tragedy and the redemptive act that follows it. It was far too wishy-washy for me to handle without a good bollocking. But Spielberg is much more intelligent man than me when it comes to movies, and perhaps I would like to have what he was thinking about this particular thing.",

It's a good feeling.Minority ReportSpielberg felt in a rush, to me. Maybe he was following Cruise. It is not the first time one of his films has been a victim of this phenomenon and it won't be the last if it will be dealt like this. The director Steven Spielberg occasionally does dip into the entertainment pool to expand his filmography. And as always we have left the screen satisfied and amazed at the spectacle that he puts enormous effort into. Those details pay off just like it does here. And while I am satisfied with the product, never for a second it convinced me that this is coming straight from Spielberg's vision. Don't get me wrong, there are few details added in the film regarding the futuristic materially rich world and the style and efficiency it comes with. But something doesn't add up. While the ambition is big, the reasoning felt short to me. For instance, I can understand the incompetence of the film to fully craft a nail biting chase sequence involving jet packs. But what I had issues with are cereal boxes that are animated. Sort of like, from the magical world of JK Rowling. These pictures animate and they endorse themselves perfectly. Just like the film does of Spielberg's sci-fi workshop. The emotional storage is empty, this time. In that sequence itself, Tom Cruise mourning over his son and the memories that he revisits feels misplaced and poorly choreographed. Yes, it could be argued that he is a stress eater and what not. But it then, doesn't communicate with us properly like it should have. The film in such ways repeatedly undermines what could have been heavy emotional moments. What we are left with is a highly paced entertaining action packed thriller which keeps changing the priorities and the headlines.",

This is the basic premise of this film, set inOne of the best films of 2002, with moral issues and a good story behind it.What would happen if we could predict a crime with details and certainty before this same crime actually happened? This is the basic premise of this film, set in 2054, where a system was set up (Washington D.C. only) called \"Pre-Crime\" that allows the authorities to take precautionary action by arresting criminals in the act before committing the act. However, the entire system relies on three people with a knack for seeing crimes that have not yet happened, and which are held virtually captive and asleep, called \"Pre-Cogs.\" However, doubts arise when Pre-Crime Division Chief John Anderton is spotted by the pre-cogs while committing a future assassination. Anderton will therefore try to understand how everything will happen and ensure that it does not happen.Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film is very well done. Set in the near future, there is much of the Orwellian universe here: people who are identified by the retina anywhere, as if a \"big brother\" watched over everything and everyone, a strong and controlling authority ... the movie, at this point, reminds a lot the works of this writer, famous for the pessimistic way in which he faced the future of humanity. The scene of the invasion of the condominium by the police spiders, in order to identify everything and everyone, is one of the moments that most reveals the controlling nature of the authorities, as if the ends justified all means, including the invasion of privacy and the home of each person. Of course, the weaknesses of the Pre-Crime system are exposed by the film and this raises complex moral and ethical questions. There is some poetic justice here, as it is someone in the system who tries to undermine the system to save itself. However, from a certain point in the movie, everything becomes increasingly clear and predictable, moving towards an ending that may, in fact, leave us wanting something more.Tom Cruise is an actor I don't particularly like, but I must admit that with this movie he got one of the best performances of his career so far. John Anderton is a good character, and Cruise was able to gradually destroy the character's confidence convincingly. The way he worked and brought to life the main character is one of the pillars that underpins the entire film, although he collaborates well with other good actors such as Max von Sydow and Colin Farrell. They never match Cruise, just giving you the support you need.On a technical level, and being a futuristic sci-fi movie, we should highlight the positive visual, special and CGI effects that Spielberg (who already has school at this point) has secured for the film. It was a job well done. Only those cars and airways didn't convince me, looking like something out of the Jetsons universe. Other than that, the focus is on realistic holograms, advanced computing, recreational 3D, robotics, etc. everything seems to be in line with the way humanity is developing.It is undoubtedly a good movie, one of the best in that distant year of 2002, and it still has room on the shelves and movie channels of our day.",
