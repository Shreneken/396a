  "critic_reviews": [
    "Part of Spielberg's skill as a filmmaker comes in choosing the right collaborators. Janusz Kaminski's gorgeous cinematography, Michael Kahn's graceful editing, Jeff Nathanson's clever script, and John Williams' score all work well in unison, but the film's masterstroke is the casting of Walken as DiCaprio's utterly decent father.",
    "It's brilliantly acted. But best of all, it's brilliantly made.",
    "It's the most charming and buoyant film Spielberg's ever made.",
    "Results in about the nicest movie you could ask for at the holidays: a gently funny, sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good, that is to say, entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp, overmanipulative Hollywood practices.",
    "Supremely entertaining.",
    "Never less than engaging; all that’s missing is a proper crescendo. The picture moves along briskly, even at two and a half hours, but it seems to be running on cruise control.",
    "Everything about this swift and gorgeous and tremendously enjoyable film is played out in a rush of staccato edits, crisp performances, and charmingly giddy subplots that coalesce into Spielberg's most purely entertaining movie in years.",
    "Nothing if not a celebration of our willingness to be gulled by life's charming strangers.",
    "Feels more like The Bill Clinton Story than \"Primary Colors\" (1998). It's a paean to naughty boys who dream of potency and become enraptured by their own scams -- a great American archetype.",
    "Based on the real-life exploits of Frank W. Abagnale but played more for myth than believability.",
    "Spielberg directs so fluently that it takes a while to perceive how well made the film is.",
    "Catch Me If You Can represents a distinct change of pace for director Steven Spielberg. This is a lighter movie than he has made in a long while, and you sense his relief that nothing much is at stake.",
    "Like a trot around the track for the thoroughbreds involved, and one of the results is that it takes them far too long to get to the finish line.",
    "As an actor DiCaprio has long been known for his ardor, not to mention his tiresome self-seriousness, but working for Spielberg, he plays his scenes with a comic deftness I thought he didn't have in him.",
    "Breezy and easy to swallow. Its maker, Steven Spielberg, hasn't had so much fun in two decades.",
    "The movie could have used a further dose of the resonance Walken gives it, and a more intellectually adventurous director might have brought the theme close to home.",
    "Brilliant performances by DiCaprio as Frank Jr. and Christopher Walken as his fallen father - and an enjoyable one by Tom Hanks.",
    "DiCaprio could hardly be better. He brings this outrageous character and his demons to life with skill, sympathy and a symphony of small, telling touches.",
    "What lingers in the memory is the impression of having experienced a frolic, a ride through the park on a bright winter day.",
    "This is not a major Spielberg film, although it is an effortlessly watchable one.",
    "An enjoyable, although not ambitious, holiday outing.",
    "The film's charm ends up worn out by the very perfection of Frank's con. We look at this teen wizard of rotating identity, and we realize we know everything about him except who he is.",
    "Even in its somewhat unwieldy form, Catch Me If You Can is charming, sparkling entertainment.",
    "Spielberg's directing is a tad less tricky than usual, but he doesn't have much talent for psychological suspense, which is the heart of the story. DiCaprio underplays nicely and Walken is superb as the con artist's downtrodden dad.",
    "Slight, enjoyable comedy.",
    "You won't find a movie that's more fun this season -- but at 2-1/2 hours, it's probably too much of a good thing.",
    "A pleasant romp through the land of Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction.",
    "In the end (and it's a happy end, to be sure), Catch Me if You Can is as crisp and trim as a new suit. Well, a new old suit - say, circa the 1960s.",
    "Breezily enjoyable but thin.",
    "We aren't talking Oscar here. We're talking truly fine performances and an unexpectedly hep John Williams score. We are talking a story that rollicks with the most rollicking of them. Not great cinema; just a great time at the movies and certainly a film well worth catching if you can.",
    "For all his genre-hopping and shape-shifting Spielberg seems to have become too big to tell small stories, which is one reason why the film sputters on one too many false endings.",
    "Spielberg's inchoate attempts at cultural observation stretch the movie out and dilute the giddiness instead of adding a pleasurable spike. When the movie doesn't feel inflated, it feels soggy.",
    "Catch offers mild fun but never as much as its animated '60s-retro opening credits portend. They're the cutest of the year.",
    "Well-enough made and highly watchable, but it lacks the one thing that would put some swing in its step and some swagger in its attitude: a sense of jazz.",
    "The whole lighter-than-air lark whizzes by like a brisk, kandy-kolored dream of the 1960s, flavored by a Saul Bass inspired credit sequence; a slinky, Henry Mancini-esque score; and a stunning array of period sets and evocative locales.",
    "DiCaprio is far more successfully cast here than in Gangs of New York: His performance is all about acting; it's a mild kick to see how he'll manage to talk his way out of nearly every scrape.",
    "What begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes. A film that took off like a hare on speed ends like a winded tortoise."

The story of a con-man in the 1960s who conned millions of checks and took the role of becoming a Pan Am Pilot, a doctor and a legal prosecuter is very interesting to watch. To me, it was interesting to see Frank basically just go all over the place. The movie has some very talented actors like Christopher Walken, Tom Hanks and especially Leonardo DiCaprio. This is easily one DiCaprio's top 5 films of all time. He really plays the role perfectly and has that kid like sense in him that we haven't seen since \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\". Plus, Tom Hanks was a great supporting actor. I've never seen him as one of those \"side characters\". However, he manages to give a great performance as Carl Handratty. As far as storyline goes, it's all over the place. There's just so much to keep up with, but with Steven Spielberg,  you're on a great journey with this likeable character. The movie does slow down at the end once Frank gets thrown in prison and eventually starts to work with the FBI, but other than that, the movie sets a good pace. Overall, it's an interesting biography on one of the biggest con-artist's in America.",

Leonardo DiCaprio is phenomenal here, as are Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, Amy Adams, and Martin Sheen. Really great cast on paper and they all did a great job in practice. The film does a really good job painting Abagnale as neither a bad guy or a good guy, rather you just feel sympathy for him since he is so smart, but uses his brains to steal, which is too bad and, plus, his rough home life certainly makes him even more sympathetic. Overall, Catch Me If You Can is a really well told, well acted, and well directed, film, that is just infinitely fun to watch.",

But let's not short the movie of its own dramatic worth. At its heart, \"Catch Me If You Can\" is not just the story of a young man forging convincing checks. It's the heart-breaking tale of the fallout that a broken home can leave lingering within the lives of its children, with the fallout in Frank Abagnale Jr.'s life namely resembling an addictive urge to cheat, steal, and run. The movie really wants us to remember this and I'm glad it does. This is also magnificently structured and executed on a screenplay front, featuring numerous twists, turns, and surprising scene dynamics that made me jealous as a screenwriter. And Spielberg's effectively expressive, period-focused direction almost needs no mention -- it's terrific work as per usual. In fact, this whole film is a terrific ride from start to finish.",

Strongly acted, beautifully filmed, Catch Me If You Can successfully conveys a warm-hearted message not only about how the life of the probably most incredible con artist of 20th century, Frank Abagnale Jr. turned upside down due to the influence his father's lifestyle and personality had on him, which raised sympathy rather than hatred but also about an unbelievable friendship between him, a criminal, and an FBI agent who, while attempting to have him arrested, realized his potential to become the world's leader in financial crime investigation.

There are occasional lapses into overly-sentimental schmaltz with the depiction of Abagnale's family life, not the first or last time with Spielberg and a long way from the worst case, but that is the one fault that was had for me.Spielberg directs impeccably, both in visual style and dramatic momentum, a directorial job that just screams of pure class. 'Catch Me if You Can' further benefits from as always beautiful cinematography from Janusz Kaminski and 60s period detail that not only looks sumptuously handsome but also evocative to make one think that it is more than just a film with a 60s setting.John Williams' score is not one of his best or most memorable, but still fits really well and has the right amount of slick jazziness, whimsy and understated pathos without over-emphasising (over-emphasis was the reason why his score for 'Amistad' was a rare misfire from him). The story takes a fascinating story and makes a ceaselessly engrossing film out of it, from the ingenious opening credits sequence to the heartfelt ending, the film is long but never feels it.This is further helped by a script that has a deft mix of genuinely funny comedy, poignant emotional moments and nail-biting suspense. The characters are intriguing. Can't praise the performances enough. Leonardo DiCaprio is movie star charisma personified, and brings wit, larceny and charm to a character that is a true crook in every sense but it is easy to see why one would fall for his actions.It is easy to overlook Tom Hanks, due to the role being not as colourful or as showy, but he brings charismatic command, generosity and doggedness in a role that could have been really bland and annoying in lesser hands. Of a sterling supporting cast, Christopher Walken is especially superb, particularly in the latter parts of the film as his life is ruined. Martin Sheen and Amy Adams are memorable, and Nathalie Bye solid.Overall, even if 'Catch Me if You Can' is not one of Spielberg's masterpieces it is one of his better later films and one of his most purely enjoyable ones. Well worth catching. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

A good 40 minutes too long, this amiable account of the trueThe larky \"Catch Me if You Can\" is like a trot around the track for the thoroughbreds involved, and one of the results is that it takes them far too long to get to the finish line. A good 40 minutes too long, this amiable account of the true story of teenage con man Frank Abagnale Jr. is a case in which the talented players could have won big had they cashed out much earlier; you can literally feel the returns diminishing the longer the game is extended.\r Abagnale’s autobiographical book recounts a youth so fantastic that it’s amazing it took Hollywood 20 years to get around to putting it on the screen. Reeling from his beloved parents’ divorce, the 16-year-old left home and discovered talents for survival that he readily turned into a genius for scamming. Playing out a string for an amazing five years, Abagnale successfully passed himself off as a Pan Am co-pilot, surgeon and lawyer while becoming a true master in one field in particular — that of writing bad checks.\r Although the film reps a lightweight breather between the darker and more grandiose projects Spielberg is taking on these days, there may also lurk a personal connection for the director with the subject of the film. After all, at the very same time Abagnale was pulling his stunts, the teenage Spielberg was dressing in coat and tie and trying to palm himself off as an executive on the Universal lot, a ploy that paid off when he got a TV directing gig by age 21.\r Setting a fizzy mood via some very mid-’60s animated opening credits and a jazzy John Williams theme that harks back to his “Johnny” Williams days as pianist for Henry Mancini’s orchestra, pic gets off to a jaunty start as DiCaprio’s Abagnale is introduced as one of three contestants on the venerable gameshow “To Tell the Truth.” Unfortunately, neither is the mood consistently maintained nor is the climax of the TV show ever shown.\r After beginning with a framing scene of FBI Special Agent Carl Hanratty (Hanks) coming to return Abagnale from his Marseilles prison cell to the U.S. in 1969, action flips back six years to New Rochelle, N.Y. Local businessman Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken) is a romantic, better at dreaming and scheming than at supporting his family. His proudest achievement is having brought back a French girl (Nathalie Baye) as his bride after WWII, so both he and his son are brought low when her infidelity triggers divorce, a matter exacerbated by dad’s troubles with the IRS.\r The FBI is on to Abagnale before long, but he proves remarkably elusive. Even when Hanratty corners the “Skyway Man,” gun drawn, in a Hollywood hotel room, Abagnale is able to turn the tables on his pursuer and slip away to continue his spree, this time in Atlanta.\r Spielberg and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson (the “Rush Hour” pics) might have taken this as a cue to begin wrapping things up themselves, but instead elaborate a great deal of follow-up material to more-is-less effect.\r Info about how Abagnale, under Hanratty’s tutelage, came to become a check fraud expert for the FBI after serving but part of his prison sentence is interesting and satisfyingly ironic, but could have been dispensed in a fraction of the time. Ultimately, the film pays for the excess baggage it takes on, suggesting this would have been a very good occasion for Spielberg to make his first under-two-hour film since “E.T.”\r Lively and appealingly retro as the picture may be, it has other problems as well. Attempt to give the story more dimensions than provided by the outlandish narrative result in a wobbly tone. While Abagnale’s love for his father and evident desire to succeed where the older man has failed provides plausible psychological motivation for the son’s exploits, the darkening of their relationship as the story progresses adds little and sidelines the narrative at times.\r More vexing still are the film’s visuals. Due to the cues received from the opening credits, the era involved and the serio-comic approach, the viewer could reasonably expect a high-gloss studio look in the manner of a Blake Edwards picture of the period; a bright, artificially polished style would have just added to the fun.\r Instead, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski eschews old-school elegance for gobs of blown backlight cascading through windows and other sources, even to the point of obscuring faces in the foregrounds. No one in Hollywood shot movies in this fashion until the ’70s, and the disjuncture here provides a big disappointment given the possibilities for period precision provided by the diverse locations, Jeannine Oppewall’s resourceful production design and Mary Zophres’ costumes.\r Charming, clean-cut and blessing his con man with an optimism that assumes the best possible outcome no matter how dire the dilemma, DiCaprio betrays not a speck of the sullenness he exhibited in “Celebrity” and “The Beach,” nor the stoic toughness he used in “Gangs of New York.”",

This film knows exactly what it wants to be, which is a blend betweenCatch Me If You Can is an enthralling film, built with some of the best pacing I’ve experienced in a film, and brilliant performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. This film knows exactly what it wants to be, which is a blend between comedy and drama and features very bright tones throughout, expressing the film as a sort of real life Tom and Jerry. This film doesn’t rely on fast, action sequences and car chases but expresses a depth of interest based on the truly intellectual Frank Abagnale J.R, who really grabs your interest as you’re left baffled at how such a young man can surpass the police skills of an agent and earn such a high quantity of money before the age of 18. This film not only succeeds as a cat and mouse drama but as a biopic – this film introduces DiCaprio’s character in such a way that it really elevates the feeling you’re on this personal crime journey with him; though the emotional power this film really fleshes out the true reasons why he is selecting the dangerous side of life and that can make you smile and almost respect the character. As I first mentioned, this film has some of the best pacing I’ve ever seen, no scenes feel too drawn out or too short, and that’s another factor that really increases the intrigue. Overall, this is a great watch and definitely one of Spielberg’s best films. Therefore, I’m going to give this a 9/10 – 94%",

So I will just say it's in my top 10. It's a movie I connected with for a couple reasons. The relationship Frank had with his dad and his parents divorce. My relationship with my dad was similar. I was friends with mine. And when my parents got divorced it was crushing. So when Frank's parents got divorced I felt his pain and confusion. I understood why he ran away. And years later since I first seen the movie I can now relate to when he found out about his father passing away. These things make his character relatable. They get you emotionally invested in the story. And Leonardo DiCaprio is my all time favourite actor and always has been. I think he's brilliant. This is such a great story based on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr. I love movies based on true stories. I always feel more invested and immersed in the movie.",

The film follows the origins and life of the main character, as well as the original and daring way in which he escapes justice until he is invariably caught.In addition to being an extremely fun movie to watch, with a game of cat and mouse full of comedic moments and some familiar melodrama to add some dramatic density to the main character, it has two extraordinary actors at an excellent time in their careers: Leonardo Di Caprio is charismatic, talented, and still young enough to give life to a teenage character; Tom Hanks appears more restrained and in a role of maturity but charged with charisma and personality Both actors are good and complement each other, sharing the protagonism and creating a good and pleasant collaboration to feel. The film also features Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen in secondary roles. Walken stands out particularly, with an appealing character and dialogues loaded with impact and meaning.I didn't feel that the film stood out for the more technical aspects. Its value is based on the performance of the actors, the story told and the way it entertains and entertains us. However, it is a film directed by Spielberg and that usually means quality: in fact, the film has excellent cinematography and was very well shot. The color, the light, all the camera work and editing were done with excellence and attention to detail. Because it is a film set in the Sixties, it also has a series of details that transport us to that time (used cars, scenarios and furniture that are emerging, the presence of some iconic brands and emblems of the time, namely in what concerns commercial aviation, clothes and costumes, fashion and hairstyles), which exude credibility, verisimilitude and historical rigor. I believe that I must also highlight the ingenious and fun way in which the initial credits were conceived, being an element that, right from the beginning, announces the tone and ambience of the film we are going to see. Last but not least, the good soundtrack, signed by John Williams.",

A jaunty caper movie inspired by real-life events, Catch Me if You Can never takes itself or its subjects too seriously, and contains more genuinely funny material than about 90% of the so-called \"comedies\" found in multiplexes these days. It also helps that in his two leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, Spielberg has actors who are capable of switching effortlessly between drama and comedy. The result is an enjoyable, although not ambitious, holiday outing. At 140 minutes, Catch Me if You Can is a little on the long side. Although, for the most part, it moves quickly, the final fifteen minutes are protracted and arguably unnecessary. In his attempts to redeem Frank, Spielberg may go too far and let the movie continue past the point where it begins to run out of steam.(Breezy comic drama by superstars).",
