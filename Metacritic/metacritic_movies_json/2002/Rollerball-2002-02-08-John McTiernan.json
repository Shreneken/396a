  "summary": "Set in 2005, this update of the classic 1975 film directed by Norman Jewison, focuses on the deadly sport that combines roller derby and basketball and packs arenas around the world.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "A turbo-charged remake that should alienate no fans of the adrenalized 1975 original.",
    "The game itself is meaningless, and the movie, much the same way, likes it like that.",
    "Rollerball was trash even back in 1975, but in some small way it was ahead of its time. The new version just makes you feel like you've been watching a lame late-night rerun while stuck in a thunderdome.",
    "Once LL Cool J, easily the film's most magnetic presence, is out of the game, the whole thing falls apart in a hazy, confusing mess.",
    "What's up with director John McTiernan? The man has got to get a career of his own -- sponging off the pale leavings of Norman Jewison just won't do.",
    "Some movies should never have been made, and high on that list is the addled new remake of Rollerball.",
    "Gets stupider as it moves along. By the end, you just don't care whether that cold-hearted snake Petrovich (that would be Reno) gets his comeuppance. Just bring on the Battle Bots, please!",
    "It's too bad this Rollerball veered off-track so swiftly, derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking.",
    "There's something junior varsity about the whole sensibility that makes the new version seem more dated than the old one.",
    "This oddly scrambled new version eventually falls apart so badly you feel embarrassed for the people who made it.",
    "Coupled with the flavorless dialogue of the inane script and a leading man who registers all the glow of a black hole, there's nothing to anchor this mindless mess of a film.",
    "The most depressing thing about this movie is not that it's such a complete waste of time, but that there are people in Hollywood who think this kind of thing is what American movie-goers are interested in seeing.",
    "The word on Rollerball is \"troubled,\" though troubled is what you call a high school junior with 50 snakes under his bed. Catastrophe is more like it.",
    "The current version, however, like its predecessor, fails as entertainment. Mr. McTiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious.",
    "Only those attracted to \"Waterworld\" or \"Last Action Hero\" level big-budget disasters need bother with this one.",
    "An incoherent mess, a jumble of footage in search of plot, meaning, rhythm and sense.",
    "Will surely end up as one of this yearâ€™s worst films.",
    "It has no moments of athletic grace amid the chaos, no apparent sense of strategy. It's basically just mayhem set to rock music.",
    "Say this for the soundtrack, it drowns out the lousy dialogue.",
    "Plentiful helpings of dreadful acting, confusing action cinematography, choppy editing and embarrassing dialogue, with the added bonus of a plot almost as dumb as that of the original film.",
    "Sheer chaos on wheels, a hysterically edited jumble that defies belief at nearly every juncture.",
    "Rollerball pushes the Hollywood action movie to stratospheric new levels of incoherence; pounding at the senses, it's mashed story, character, time and space into a chunky hash.",
    "A movie of such rank stupidity and appalling taste.",
    "McTiernan's Rollerball is a movie masochist's delight.",
    "Remarkably empty, remarkably noisy, remarkably pleasureless. It's unwatchable.",
    "As in the comparatively quaint original film, there are whiffs of greed, carnage, social upheaval and the triumph of the numskull, but it's all rendered noxious nonsense by zooming hot rods, vague T&A, irritating jump-cuts and a bunch of dipshit Power Ranger wannabes slamming in hell's moshpit.",
    "Bad and baffling from the get-go, probably the only good thing to come out of this Rollerball is the boon it gives the porn industry in terms of another ready-made title to spoof."

Die Hard was the Contra of the 80's, Last Action Hero was a pretty good B-movie of the 90's, Medicine Man (I still have to watch that movie). I know it's hard why he was once considered the land of the greats of action movie nostalgia. But then he threw it all away in Rollerball.I know a lot about Rollerball's messy remake. The production has way sorts of problems like it was originally going to be Rated R for its graphic violence and a lot of sex in this movie. But unlike another movie that cause a stir (Howard The Duck), the MPAA decided to make the movie to a family audience and give it a s***ty PG-13 rating nobody likes. The director of the film hated the script nearing the movie's completion and cause MGM to be re-shooted and re-edit the final product of the movie which was supposed to be released in the Summer of 2001. But before the 9/11 attacks happened, the film's schedule had to be pushed to February 8, 2002. The movie finally came out and I guessed it right, it was a wasted load of crap. Admidst all of the behind-the-scenes scrutiny over its production, not one many moviegoer see this movie in an empty theater because it was extremely panned by everyone. I think Rollerball is the gold standard of \"It's Batman & Robin on Ice\" of awfully bad movies. Like I said, the script that the studio (allegedly) think it was good, but hell no the story is s**t, the writing is s**t, and why in the hell did Chris Klein and the entire cast (LL Cool J included) decided it was a great idea to star in this dumpster fire. Not even an appearance by Paul Heyman and WWE's residential Hardcore badass Shane Macmahon can't even save this film. It's like telling all the souless fans to get hyped and see the movie promote it on the TNN Network. The movie was so bad, that was pretty much it for John McTiernan's directing career. No wonder why he decided he threw in the towel by getting his ass arrested for failed unpaid taxes and fraud allegations. For those who have Netflix ( or not), then I suggest you shold check out the original 1975 cult classic instead. I just hope MGM just learned their lesson not to remake an iconic classic ever again. I take that back, they did (The Pink Panther, Robocop, Carrie, etc.) Goddamnit, MGM.",
