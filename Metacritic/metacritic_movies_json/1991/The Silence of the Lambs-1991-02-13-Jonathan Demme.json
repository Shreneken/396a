    "FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), brainiac cannibal Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) and tackle-tucking serial killer Jame Gumb (Ted Levine) make for one of cinema’s great ménages à trois.",
    "A mesmerizing thriller that will grip audiences from first scene to last.",
    "The superbly crafted suspense thriller…slams you like a sudden blast of bone-chilling, pulse-pounding terror.",
    "Under Jonathan Demme's masterful cinematic surgery, we get into Lecter's twisted skull and, through this outrageous descent, we come to see this sinister in the everyday.",
    "Delicious with foreboding, a masterly suspense thriller that toys with our anticipation like a well-fed cat.",
    "Though the film's subject matter is grisly, the electricity between Foster and Hopkins during their prison tête-à-têtes could power every maximum-security prison in this country.",
    "Hopkins plays the cannibalistic doctor with a quiet, controlled erudition, lacing his performance with moments of black humor. His Lecter is a sort of satanic Sherlock Holmes whose spasms of violence are all the more terrifying because they erupt from beneath such an intelligent and refined mask.",
    "A smart, restrained entertainment, it doesn't splash around in blood and hysteria. It doesn't have to.",
    "At long, long last: the real thing.",
    "It has been a good long while since I have felt the presence of Evil so manifestly demonstrated as in the first appearance of Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs.",
    "For me, the distinguishing factor is the sense of humanity director Jonathan Demme brings to this inhumane material.",
    "Chilling and creepy, and there's no denying that the most celebrated aspect of the film -- the Clarice/Hannibal connection -- could not have been accomplished with greater skill.",
    "An accomplished, effective, grisly, and exceptionally sick slasher film that I can't with any conscience recommend, because the purposes to which it places its considerable ingenuity are ultimately rather foul.",
    "The plot is squeezed dry in this bloody Valentine from Hollywood and becomes annoyingly predictable. Thriller stumbles on its own success"

Now most people would say the scarier, the better. But if something is scary to you, I don't see how you could like it. And yet, this film had scared me like never before and yet I can never let go of the feeling of how amazing it was. The Silence of the Lambs is a crime-suspense thriller, starring Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. It's about a FBI trainee Clarice Starling, who is assigned to help capture a serial killer by the name of Buffalo Bill.  She simply has to question a former murderer, Hannibal Lector, better known as \"Hannibal the Cannibal\". The FBI believes there might be some sort of connections between the two killers, and asks Clarice to figure out what. And what begins as a small questioning process begins to evolve into one of the greatest crime story ever told. The Silence of the Lambs won 5 Academy Awards, including Best Lead Actor, Best Lead Actress, and Best Picture. It truly deserved all these wins, especially the acting. Jodie Foster's acting as Clarice Starling was great, but what really made this film worthwhile was Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector. Never have I seen a villain so kind, yet so sinister and evil. Every word and breath he takes is haunting. You know that even when he talks so kindly to Clarice, he has some evil thoughts or something processing in his mind that the viewer can't just understand. That's what makes Anthony Hopkins the best thing about the whole film. Then I believe the second best thing is the cinematography. This film's cinematography is excellent, and done like no other movie before. You see that whenever there's a new character introduced, it's shown in the perspective of the main characterâ",

It has never left popular culture still heavily influencing films today and is instantly recognizable from its many references to famous movie quotes. Apart from the really impressive performances by the entire cast (who literally all bring their A-Game), The Silence of the Lambs greatest strength is that it doesn't wallow in depravity, given the nature of the book and the screenplay, wisely choosing to keep a lot of the grisly violence off the screen which makes it even more terrifying. The film is a character study into the minds of two psychopaths and the young rookie cadet trying to match wits with them.The dialog is snappy and sharp and the first part of the film is very procedural and slow moving (although no less absorbing) but once the second half kicks in, with a fantastic bait and switch twist it becomes a rollercoaster ride of pure unnerving tension as the young cadet finds herself alone in a mad man's dungeon trying to save his next victim.I saw the film in theaters and vividly remember people hiding underneath their chairs the films tension was so unbearable in its climax. Of course we have been desensitized in the intervening years since this film released so some may look upon the film today and not understand why it frightened so many people upon release but you have to remember no film from this genre had played cat and mouse with its audience the way this film did back upon release, so it caught everybody off guard.Absolutely brilliant stuff, highly deserving to be in a class of only three films to ever win all five major Academy Awards and easily in my top 5 films of all time.",

The characters here are as nuanced as I've ever seen.  Foster's performance is also excellent.  I must warn you, it's a graphic, disturbing, and at times even disgusting film, and on a different note some of the technical aspects of the movie haven't aged so well, but all in all, it's so memorable and haunting that I have to call it an absolute horror/crime classic.

This movie truly heightens your sense to the maximum degree, you are completely and utterly aware of intentions and brooding desires from both Buffalo Bill and Hannibal, but does it completely succeed in feeding these desires? Not entirely, but in many respects it does. The film clearly has a certain essence of expression to it for it's first pointed to be generic yet surprisingly deep hill-billy antagonist. We can see an almost angering cycle of predator transforming into scavenger and a brief victory of innocence immediately terminated by the film's excellent conclusion which indicates a slightly ambiguous, although intentionally intriguing, return to norm. However, I believe Silence of the Lambs may be a little too intrigued with it's fascinating characters to give them any lore or necessary origin, something I was craving to see from Hannibal but oh my mouth was completely watering to see it from Buffalo Bill. This confused moth man, I was likewise confused whether to feel sympathy or not due to the fantastic Goodbye Horses sequence. Nonetheless, Silence of the lambs is a structural master-class and daringly explores decay in it's natural form although it's complete cocooning whittles away at some earth shattering, pivotal messages the film was aiming for.",

Granted, 1991 was a slow year for movies, and many pundits have remarked that the Oscar field was among the weakest ever (the other contenders were Disney's Beauty and the Beast, Bugsy, JFK, and the overrated The Prince of Tides), but the strong showing of The Silence of the Lambs was a surprise to almost everyone. In the first place, it was released in February 1991, a date thought to be beyond the short memories of the Academy members. Secondly, it is a dark psychological thriller - the kind of movie that occasionally receives a Best Picture nomination, but almost never takes home the statuette.\r Although The Silence of the Lambs is brilliantly constructed and powerfully acted, and became one of the most recognizable thrillers of the '90s, it was neither the best movie of the year (a citation I would award to Beauty and the Beast) nor even the best thriller (overall, Dead Again impressed me more). The Silence of the Lambs contains a number of inarguably great scenes, but the screenplay, adapted from Thomas Harris' novel, suffers from a split personality. The scenes featuring Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) are the stuff of legends. However, the rest of the movie, which concentrates on the pursuit of serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), has a familiar, derivative feel. In truth, the climax couldn't be more mundane.\r There is little doubt that the most memorable aspect of The Silence of the Lambs is Anthony Hopkins' incomparable performance as Lecter. Taking over for Brian Cox, who was effective, but not especially memorable, as the good doctor in 1986's Manhunter, Hopkins instantly makes the role his own, capturing and conveying the charismatic essence of pure evil. To his dying day, no matter how many roles he plays in the interim, Hopkins will forever be known for this part. (It is a credit to Hopkins' ability as an actor that this part did not result in stereotyping. His post-Silence career has been greatly varied, with roles as widely diverse as a stodgy butler in Merchant-Ivory's The Remains of the Day and an action hero in The Edge.) I can throw out any number of superlatives, but none of them do justice to this chilling performance, which I labeled as the best acting work of the '90s. Want to feel the icy fingers of terror stroke your heart? Watch this mixture of brilliant eloquence and inhuman cruelty. As portrayed by Hopkins, Hannibal is both a suave, cultured gentleman and an unspeakable fiend. He is gracious and monstrous at the same time. (Hopkins also provided one of the most quotable lines in recent film history with \"I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti\", which was followed by an inimitable slithering slurp.)\r It's impossible to mention Clarice without noting that she is one of the rarest commodities in thrillers: a female hero. In interviews, Foster has indicated that, of all the roles she has played in a career that began in childhood, Clarice is her favorite (which makes it odd that she didn't try harder to re-arrange her schedule so she could reprise the part in The Silence of the Lambs' sequel, Hannibal). In addition to having to face Lecter's mind-games and the dangers associated with Buffalo Bill, she must deal with the sexual politics of being a woman in a man's world. The most telling scene occurs early in the movie, when Crawford takes her on a \"field trip\" to view the latest victim. There, in a hick town, she finds herself stripped of authority as a result of a casual comment by Crawford, and surrounded by a group of macho, male cops. After momentarily escaping by taking flight into a memory of her father's funeral, she regroups and takes charge of the situation, ordering the men to clear the room where the body is housed. Thus does Clarice become a woman championing victimized women - a real heroine, not a woman imitating a testosterone-driven stereotype.\r The Silence of the Lambs may not have been the best thriller of the year, but it was the most chilling and creepy, and there's no denying that the most celebrated aspect of the film - the Clarice/Hannibal connection - could not have been accomplished with greater skill.",

Despite the relatively minimal screen time that he receives, Anthony Hopkins leaves a lasting impression with his performance as the brilliant but maniacal Lecter. Nobody could've nailed those roles better than Foster and Hopkins did; the dynamic between their characters is ultimately what makes this movie as great as it is. The Silence of the Lambs is undoubtedly one of the greatest movies that I've ever seen.",

That's what it was like for me in 1992 when Silence of the Lambs swept the Oscar's (Best Picture, Director, Actor and Actress). And boy did the movie deserve it. Jonathan Demme's fantastic retelling of the classic book by Thomas Harris. Anthony Hopkins' scene-chewing Hannibal Lecter turned him into a pop culture icon (and unfortunately a slew of middling sequels). And Jodie Foster's grim and naive portrayal of Clarice. The final touch is that haunting score. Some of the best movies out there are elevated by a musical score that puts it another league. A phenomenal classic.",

It’s one of the very few thrillers (not horror films, as asinine Hollywood likes to classify it) that improves with time, similarly to the Chianti Hannibal Lecter mentions in the essential The Silence of the Lambs quote, as it’s neither a whodunit nor a howcatchem, but rather a study of psychopaths’ and serial killers’ twisted states of mind.",

Directed by Jonathan Demme, it has screenplay by Ted Tally, and has the participation of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. Won five Oscars (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay; was also nominated for Best Sound and Best Editing).This film needs no introduction and has already become a classic. The Hanibal character is a horror icon and consecrated Hopkins as one of the greatest masters of representation of the late twentieth century. Decidedly, watching this film, we have the notion that all factors combined, in the ideal measure, to make a piece of art that, even so, due to the topic and some more shocking scenes, is not suitable for sensitive people.The script is excellent and works in a masterly manner, without errors or holes. The work of director was essential for the success of the film, along with the performance of the actors themselves. In fact, even the supporting actors in the film were very good in their roles, although the spotlight have been under the heads of Hopkins and Foster. The two actors were brilliant, the way they interact is a drama lesson. The penetrating gaze of Hopkins, and his viperous cynicism, are one of the registered marks of the film. The rest (sets, costumes, photography and soundtrack) is impeccable. It's a great movie, recommended to those who like a suspense story.",

Even though Lecter is known as an ingenious manipulator and Starling has been warned against getting personal with him, she must proceed, especially after the daughter of a U.S. senator becomes Buffalo Bill’s latest captive.\r Just as it seems the noose is tightening around the killer, Lecter, in an remarkably fine suspense Sequence, manages an unthinkable escape. The FBI and, on her own, Starling must use all the info and guts they have to finally corner Buffalo Bill. But then, there is Lecter.\r Harris’ plot is as tight as a coiled rattler, and it has motivated Jonathan Demme to turn out his leanest, meanest work. Abandoning the colorful frills and offbeat mixed moods of “Something Wild” and “Married to the Mob,” this always interesting director has devoted himself to relentless storytelling.\r There is not a false note nor an extraneous moment as he establishes a vise-like hold almost immediately and doesn’t let up even through the chilling final shot. In the second half of “Something Wild,” Demme demonstrated a marked talent for rough suspense, something he sustains for two hours here.\r At the outset, Demme and his longtime ace lenser, Tak Fujimoto, plunge the viewer directly into the p.o.v. of the novice investigator Stariing, as she goes face to face with the diabolical Lecter and, as suggested by the title, is forced to confront her own childhood demons relating to the slaughter of animals. Film is omniscient, however, showing the activities of Buffalo Bill as well as those of Lecter later on.\r In a strong performance, Foster fully registers the inner strength her character must summon up to meet the chaUenges and occasional humiliations her tough assignment entails.\r Cast against type as a reserved man in glasses and a suit, Scott Glenn is a very agreeable surprise as the FBI agent who takes a chance by putting his young charge on the case.\r The juiciest part is Hopkins,’ and he makes the most of it. Helped by some highly dramatic lighting, actor makes the role the personification of brilliant, hypnotic evil, and the screen jolts with electricity whenever he is on. This is, without doubt, his most effective film appearance to date.\r From the huge hall in which Lecter is eerily caged at one point to the dingy rooms of Buffalo Bill’s house, Kristi Zea’s production design is critical to the picture’s mood. Editor Craig McKay keeps doesn’t let a frame stay on too long, and Howard Shore’s rather traditional score outstandingly amplifies the tension and psychological mystery.",

This is a man who sketches and listens to Mozart while planning to literally eat off a policeman's face, a creature sensitive to Starling's tale of childhood torment yet cruelly reticent in supplying clues that might lead to the capture of the serial killer closest to his natural heir.\r Ultimately, though, Demme's breakthrough film is a triumph by virtue of its narrative strength, its sheer confidence in tackling Harris complex characterisation head-on, and its ability to scare the **** out of its audience without ever once resorting to amateur hour frightwigs and hands-over-the-eyes. Fingerlickin' good.\r A first unmissable, then enduring, but always unmissable classic.",

Granted, 1991 was a slow year for movies, and many pundits have remarked that the Oscar field was among the weakest ever (the other contenders were Disney's Beauty and the Beast, Bugsy, JFK, and the overrated The Prince of Tides), but the strong showing of The Silence of the Lambs was a surprise to almost everyone. In the first place, it was released in February 1991, a date thought to be beyond the short memories of the Academy members. Secondly, it is a dark psychological thriller - the kind of movie that occasionally receives a Best Picture nomination, but almost never takes home the statuette.\r Although The Silence of the Lambs is brilliantly constructed and powerfully acted, and became one of the most recognizable thrillers of the '90s, it was neither the best movie of the year (a citation I would award to Beauty and the Beast) nor even the best thriller (overall, Dead Again impressed me more). The Silence of the Lambs contains a number of inarguably great scenes, but the screenplay, adapted from Thomas Harris' novel, suffers from a split personality. The scenes featuring Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) are the stuff of legends. However, the rest of the movie, which concentrates on the pursuit of serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), has a familiar, derivative feel. In truth, the climax couldn't be more mundane.\r There is little doubt that the most memorable aspect of The Silence of the Lambs is Anthony Hopkins' incomparable performance as Lecter. Taking over for Brian Cox, who was effective, but not especially memorable, as the good doctor in 1986's Manhunter, Hopkins instantly makes the role his own, capturing and conveying the charismatic essence of pure evil. To his dying day, no matter how many roles he plays in the interim, Hopkins will forever be known for this part. (It is a credit to Hopkins' ability as an actor that this part did not result in stereotyping. His post-Silence career has been greatly varied, with roles as widely diverse as a stodgy butler in Merchant-Ivory's The Remains of the Day and an action hero in The Edge.) I can throw out any number of superlatives, but none of them do justice to this chilling performance, which I labeled as the best acting work of the '90s. Want to feel the icy fingers of terror stroke your heart? Watch this mixture of brilliant eloquence and inhuman cruelty. As portrayed by Hopkins, Hannibal is both a suave, cultured gentleman and an unspeakable fiend. He is gracious and monstrous at the same time. (Hopkins also provided one of the most quotable lines in recent film history with \"I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti\", which was followed by an inimitable slithering slurp.)\r Jodie Foster's interpretation of Clarice Starling is not as high-profile as Hopkins' work, but the film wouldn't have been the same without her. In a quiet, non-flashy manner, Foster takes ownership of Clarice, transforming her into the movie's human anchor; she is our point-of-entry into the contorted, grotesque world of murder, insanity, and decadence. Clarice is developed into a multidimensional human being who is driven to succeed in a man's world, haunted by memories of the loving father she lost at an early age, and fascinated by the twisted brilliance of Lecter. There isn't a false note in the performance. Foster's best scenes are the ones in which she is paired with Hopkins, such as the instance in which Clarice's facial expression crumbles almost imperceptibly while Lecter coldly and cruelly dissects her life. It's arguable whether Foster deserved a Best Actress Oscar for her work in The Silence of the Lambs, but there's no doubt that she is owed more recognition for the film's success than she often receives.\r Since its 1991 release, much has been written about The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal Lecter, Clarice Starling, and the relationship between them. Thomas Harris was so intrigued by the characters that he wrote the sequel, Hannibal, which soared into the top spot on best-seller lists countrywide as soon as it was released. The motion picture follow-up, directed by Ridley Scott and starring Hopkins and Julianne Moore (replacing Foster), is set to open on the 10th anniversary of the release of The Silence of the Lambs. If it's half as involving, it will be a success. The Silence of the Lambs may not have been the best thriller of the year, but it was the most chilling and creepy, and there's no denying that the most celebrated aspect of the film - the Clarice/Hannibal connection - could not have been accomplished with greater skill.",

Armed with an incredible plot, he always finds a space for his character to come forth and have their voices heard. His spin on these scripts is why the characters grow iconic both artistically and culturally. Of course, you'd be then imitating Anthony Hopkins over the years. Their perspectives are kept on table with a panache that would make even the most reserved, head turn and eyes pop. And maybe, that is why, for a character that is barely on screen, gets the nod of being the lead actor in a film. The best actor, to be precise. And there have been said plenty about this Hannibal Lecter over the years.So here, I'd like to focus on Jodie Foster. She is the mother of this case. And I feel this for her persona is just as caring as vulnerably open she is about herself. No matter how much powerful everyone else is, no matter how much authority do others have access to, she is the one, consuming all the energy. Just taking it in. And you are waiting for her to express it. Explode onto someone, something. But she doesn't give you that pleasure, just as she won't in front of others.That's power. There is something admirable on controlling a scene, a film by being the underrated character. And that is why I love underrated characters, the most. Since the beginning. To say so much, to yell. To be so much, to act. And yet, you steer your emotions inwards. Foster's both character and performance is a testimony to those days that has led us here. The Silence Of The Lambs is a silence that is going to stay with you for ages, not scaring you but consoling you, for a happy ending.",

I've seen this movie multiple times and I can confidently say it's in my top 3 of all-time best films. With a slow build and subtle foreshadowing, this psychological thriller will be on your mind even weeks after you've seen it. The two main characters of the story have a dynamic that I've never seen in other movies like this before, I'd sometimes forget I was watching a movie because their chemistry on screen was unmatched. A story of a young detective trying to earn her place on the force takes on the task of hunting down a serial killer named \"Buffalo Bill\" who skins women alive. To find more clues she speaks with the famed serial killer Hannibal \"the cannibal\" Lector, a former psychiatrist who helps her break down the clues of the case. The hunting down of Buffalo Bill is merely a side plot while Hannibal is the true star of the film as we see his intelligence and confusing charisma show itself through different scenarios of the movie. The shuttle foreshadowing of Clarice (the detectives) childhood past on a farm impacting her relationship with Hannibal gives us an unspoken story of her true personality and motivations, while Hannibal plays with her thoughts to not only help her with the case but to amuse himself in the process. The film itself lacks action and the blood and guts of traditional horror flicks but the slow build-up pays off at the end.  A movie that leaves no stone unturned is perfect for those who love to analyze and be surprised. The perfect comparison for this movie would be a puzzle, while very few people find thrill in putting a puzzle together, the pride you feel in completion is worth the effort.  The film is boring and drawn out at times but the payoff is the cherry on top. Every film buff and horror lover needs to see this film at least once in their life so they can experience this artful journey.",

Anthony Hopkins is so memorable people think of him as the primary antagonist, he stole the show too such an extent they made it into an entire franchise solely based around him, they give him a leading actor Oscar an award he shouldn't have even been eligible for considering he's only onscreen for 16 minutes but they didn't care.Jodie Foster also deserves her recognition giving an absolutely stellar performance as the FBI trainee Clarice Starling, the movie uses under utilised filming techniques to draw it's audience in like getting it's actors to deliver lines directly into camera (a very unorthodox method considering the very first thing actors tell you not too do is look at the camera.) it's very effective here and should be done more in films.There is analysis videos on YouTube that go in depth into the editing and camerawork during the Clarice and Lector scenes and show the various techniques used to make those scenes some of the best in film history. A masterpiece of a movie with the best end credits sequence I've ever seen.",

If you are looking for an answer to this question,then I have it for you.The 2 cental charectors  Dr.Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling are what makes this such a great movie.The connection between those two charecters were so brilliantly explored through this movie and the oscar winning perfomances from both Anthony Hopkins and Jodie foster adds to the charm..It is a masterpiece and surely worth your time...",
