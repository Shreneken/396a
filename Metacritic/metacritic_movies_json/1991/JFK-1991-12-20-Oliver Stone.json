        "Stone and his editors, Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia, have somehow triumphed over the tumult of material here and made it work - made it grip and disturb us.",
        "[Stone's] filmmaking is so supple and alive, his obsession with the visual aspect of history so electrifying, that JFK practically roots itself in your imagination.",
        "JFK is Stone's best and most emotional film since \"Platoon.\"",
        "Through his art and passion, Stone makes JFK plausible, and turns his thesis of a coup d'etat into fodder for renewed debate.",
        "JFK still retains a primal power; no number of derivative, headache-inducing CSI episodes can blunt the impact of Stone's aggressive visuals, and the film's plea for accountability and honesty in government is as vital now as ever.",
        "Controversy and all, JFK is one of the year's most powerful and provocative films.",
        "Director and co-screenwriter Oliver Stone pulls off an amazing filmmaking feat with JFK, transforming the dry minutiae of every John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory of the past three decades into riveting screen material.",
        "So is JFK a good movie? Actually, it\u2019s a great movie that looks better with each passing year. Even aside from what it\u2019s saying, and even with the many, many forced moments, JFK has a mad genius about it.",
        "Truth or not, this is an exceptional piece of cinema, deeply provoking and audacious.",
        "Oliver Stone's JFK is electric muckraking filmmaking.",
        "Stone creates a riveting marriage of fact and fiction, hypothesis and empirical proof in the edge-of-the-seat spirit of a conspiracy thriller.",
        "Stone makes it virtually impossible to leave the theatre convinced, beyond all shadow of doubt, of the lone gunman theory.",
        "The movie is often tremendously exciting.",
        "The movie, which is simultaneously arrogant and timorous, has been unable to separate the important material from the merely colorful.",
        "Stone's all-purpose conspiracy theory, built like a house of cards, rivals \"Mississippi Burning\" in its sheer crudeness and contempt for the audience."

Jim Garrison and his crusade for the truth about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. I've heard many different things about the legitimacy of \"JFK\", but it does bring up a series of valid questions surrounding Kennedy's murder. Everyone in this star-studded cast brought their A-game for \"JFK\". From Kevin Costner's commanding turn as Jim Garrison to Gary Oldman's dynamic portrayal of Lee Harvey Oswald, the acting remains a flawless aspect of the film. Another aspect of the film I admired was the Oscar-winning cinematography. Cinematographer Robert Richardson does a stunning job at seamlessly integrating actual archive footage and mock archive footage into the film. He also does a fairly impressive job with lighting techniques in some more tense scenes. Overall, \"JFK\" struck a very powerful chord with me, and it remains a fairly provocative film that enforces that the power to question is one of the most effective abilities of the citizens of a country.",

Despite this it certainly presents a compelling case against the widely believed lone gunman theory and will certainly inspire some to delve a little deeper into that fateful day in 1963.",

Structured as a bit of a courtroom drama with New Orleans DA Jim GarrisonSpinning an impeccable yarn about the conspiracy theories revolving the assassination of John F. Kennedy, JFK is a captivating, riveting, and truly compelling film. Structured as a bit of a courtroom drama with New Orleans DA Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) investigating the case, interviewing people with knowledge of the situation, and presenting his case to the jury. While compelling, the film is definitely very long, especially the director's cut. The film does a good job weaving everybody into the final case, while also showing just how hard it was to prove his conspiracy case against businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) being involved in the assassination of JFK. What Garrison does do, however, is convince the audience of every conspiracy theory possible. Laying out the evidence and painstakingly going though the minutia of details, everything sounds plausible and backed up with incredible evidence. What definitely becomes clear is the fact that there were multiple shooters. While Stone no doubt framed it in that fashion with the details he had, it should just be obvious to anybody knowing about the law of physics in relation to the magical bullet.Powerfully told, smartly written, and excellently acted, the film is anchored by a terrific lead performance by Kevin Costner. The embattled New Orleans DA with a tough home life as a result of his obsession, his home life may be a bit cliched. But while he is interviewing people and pitching his case, Costner is fantastic. The closing monologue as Garrison makes his case to the people is impeccably acted and written with Costner nailing every line, every question, and every moment of that sequence. Stone's direction turns the sequence into the equivalent of a hypnotic episode and Costner slinks right down into it perfectly. He is a terrific lawyer and detective in this film and matches the film's epic quality.However, what truly adds to the film's epic feeling is the supporting cast. Littered in this film are various tremendous actors giving terrific supporting performances. These include, but are not limited to, Jack Lemmon, Joe Pesci, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones, Edward Asner, Gary Oldman, Laurie Metcalf, and Michael Rooker. The whole cast, from beginning to end, truly nail their roles and add brilliantly to the odd cast of characters linked to the assassination of Kennedy. With each interview sequence being incredibly tense, riveting, and well told, the film finds power in its dialogue that more than entertains. With each interview, it becomes tough to balance everything we have heard in our minds, but Stone is smart to include wrap-up scenes in the DA's office every once in a while where the group find out exactly where they are and what they have that they can use in a courtroom.That said, it becomes clear during the film that people are just not ready. Garrison spins this incredible case that very clearly points to the conspiracy, but he is brick walled throughout by the media. Even though the jury agrees there was a conspiracy behind the murder, the connection to Clay Shaw is tenuous at best relying on sketchy witnesses. But, to uncover the conspiracy behind anything, weeding through what the witnesses say is a must, no matter who they are. People too willingly write off conspiracy nuts as crazy loons, even if some of what they say may be based in fact or covered up fact. Not every inch of conspiracy theories are true, but more than people are willing to admit. JFK shows this incredibly well with even employees in the DA's office expressing doubt about what they have and the horrible witnesses they talked to. That said, the key to understanding the assassination is given X (Donald Sutherland). In a terrific supporting role, Sutherland's mysterious military colonel tells Garrison that the who is just scenery to distract people from the why. Incredibly true, every conspiracy theory falls down when people get down into the who. Often times, there is very little evidence supporting the who or loose connections at best. If people focused on the why and worried about the who later, then maybe something would actually come out of most conspiracy theories.Long, maybe too long, but compelling and a truly unique conspiracy thriller mixed with courtroom drama, JFK is one of director Oliver Stone's best work with an excellent performance from Costner and the whole cast. Easily convincing the audience that there was a conspiracy, it does not pretend to show us the who because it hardly matters who kills Kennedy. Rather, Stone's film painstakingly sets the scene for why and makes a compelling case on that front. Now, it is up to the jury of the audience to figure out whether they believe it or not.",

It is also the mother of all conspiracy theories together with Roswell with probably thousands of variations. It is far to interesting to ever be left alone. To be fairThe assassination of JFK is one of the biggest stories of all times. It is also the mother of all conspiracy theories together with Roswell with probably thousands of variations. It is far to interesting to ever be left alone. To be fair there is a lot to debate. Kennedy had many enemies in the CIA, military, the mafia who founded his campaign, in politics and other areas that want to get him out of office. As always the investigation got really political, witnesses saw different things from each other (normality with so many people), the report has loop holes and errors were made. I repeat nothing abnormal and the bigger an investigation gets the more errors will be made and inconsistencies will be found. After looking into both sides I have no clue who is right or wrong.  But lets go to the movie. The movie is based on the book  \u201cOn the trail of Assassins\u201d by prosecutor Jim Garrison who made in real life a re-investigation in the assassination of JFK as the official Warren-Report had some inconsistency and weaknesses. The film is well crafted, directed and has a legendary cast of actors. Like I said the story itself is one of the most interesting stories of all time and a mystery people talk about today over 50 years later. The director Oliver Stone knew what he did and made a remarkable movie. The cast is superb with legendary names like Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemon and Donald Sutherland to name a few. Rarely ever get you such a cast of talented actors in one movie and I say everyone delivers. It is a great overall performance that made this movie even better. Then we have the score from John Williams who is a legend himself. It enhances the atmosphere and is fitting. The rest is history as the movie earned fan and critical acclaim. It won 2 Oscars and was nominated for 6 more. Is it factual correct or solves the mystery? I don't know about either or if it can even be solved. It is however entertaining and I enjoyed it in a time where I normally would have avoided such a movie. Overall I think this is a classic worth watching and remembering.",

JFK isJFK is an absolute masterwork of filmmaking and story telling, never has editing and cinematography blanded so well together, to create one of the most riveting, educational, thrilling, mysterious, and controversial films of all time. JFK is one of the best pieces of filmmaking i've ever seen, and one of my all-time favorite films.\r With films like this, where the subject matter is delicate and lies close to people's heart, and where it is incredibly controversial there will always be haters of the movie just because they hate it (I've read many reviews like that) without even viewing the film properly, without predjudice or anything like that.\rI am no american, and i am too young to have been alive around 1963, so i knew little about the assassination going into this film, except ofcourse that JFK was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald (which is something i learned in school, i didnt know if it was true or not, i did know that there was some controvery around the assassination though, and that's it) So i went in watching without predjudice. A movie like this will always have historians or other people complaining about how factually inaccurate it is, and frankly, i dont care about this in any way, same with biographies, i dont care if it is incredibly inaccurate, i care if it is a well-made film, and damn, JFK is one hell of a well made film. It's one of the most riveting, educational, thrilling, mysterious, and controversial films of all time. In my honest opinion there really is little to complain here.\r The main thing about this film is exposition and there's a lot of it in the film. There are times when Stone essentially asks us to listen while a character explains things. These scenes could have been deadly. He makes them exciting by using persuasive actors, by cutting between many different points of view, and by reconstructing the events being described. Stone's film is hypnotically watchable. Leaving aside all of its drama and emotion, it is a masterpiece of film assembly. The writing, the editing, the music, the photography, are all used here in a film of enormous complexity, to weave a persuasive tapestry out of an overwhelming mountain of evidence and testimony. Film students will examine this film in wonder in the years to come, astonished at how much information it contains, how many characters, how many interlocking flashbacks, what skillful interweaving of documentary and fictional footage. The film hurtles for 188 minutes through a sea of information and conjecture, and never falters and never confuses us. That is not to say that we are quite sure, when it is over and we try to reconstruct the experience in our minds, exactly what Stone's conclusions are. \"JFK\" does not unmask the secrets of the Kennedy assassination. Instead, it uses the Garrison character as a seeker for truth who finds that the murder could not have happened according to the official version.\r JFK is one of the best edited films of all time.",

The subjective procedure is the conflict that the makers neither can solve or eradicate due to its track that it has chosen. The avid narrative that is at best fueled with rage and sanity and at mediocrity a raw flat investigation. Stone's law are never black or white, he walk a perfect and safer line in order to filter out its smarter audience. He not only has the potential and range to flash out its star cast but foliates them in its palpable heartbreaking tone. Driven by the star power and stellar performances by each cast member, the runtime barely matters, in fact it leaves the audience hungry for more. It is rich on technical aspects like advanced camera work with smart editing, metaphorical cinematography and finely detailed art designing. Brimmed with various perspective and enough content for the audience to work on it keeps them tangled in its pathos bubble. Stone's work on adaptation might be smart and cut deeper but its eye popping execution is the game changer. Costner oozes power, vulnerable and pleads for the justice as the script and viewers demands with a support from a louder and complex Oldman, emotionally driven Rooker and reserved Jones. The final speech, Costner at the heart of it, and the research of the incident carried off by the makers are the high points of the feature. JFK is not only an important feature on terms of the raised questions in here but the craft whose exploration undeniably bedazzles you.",
