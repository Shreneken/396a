  "critic_reviews": [
    "A great movie... A pop epiphany, marking that commercially creative point where the power of Hollywood meets the purity of myth.",
    "Because it is a sequel, it's less satisfying than the more idea-driven original, but this is still top-flight kick-ass entertainment",
    "Cameron's achievement isn't only technical. He's using all the not-so-cheap thrills of a violent genre to make a movie with an antiviolence message, and the wonder of T2 is that he pulls it off without looking silly.",
    "The key element in any action picture, I think, is a good villain. Terminator 2 has one, along with an intriguing hero and fierce heroine, and a young boy who is played by Furlong with guts and energy.",
    "T2 features bigger, bolder, more energetic action sequences than its predecessor.",
    "The movie is a great big feast of wreckage. But that’s also what makes it a bit numbing.",
    "As with \"Aliens,\" director James Cameron has again taken a first rate science fiction film and crafted a sequel that's in some ways more impressive - expanding on the original rather than merely remaking it.",
    "Visceral to the point of overkill (and beyond), a berserk blizzard of kinetic images, it doesn't even give you time to be scared.",
    "The action in Terminator 2 is edited for maximum suspense, and much of it is mounted on such a grand scale that little in movie history comes close. (Scenes in last summer's Die Hard 2 did, but they lacked the finesse of the new film).",
    "The film's relentless pummeling grows wearying at 135 minutes. The first Terminator, a half-hour shorter, was leaner and meaner.",
    "It's a joyride until you think about the film's biggest contradiction. How come this movie celebrating the superiority of human feelings over machine precision is most alive when thrilling in the mechanical perfection of the Terminator and T-1000? Inside Terminator 2 beats a human heart. But its soul is that of a killer machine.",
    "Trend-setting visuals compensate for a plot that lacks the imagination and edge of the 1984 original.",
    "Mr. Cameron has made a swift, exciting special-effects epic that thoroughly justifies its vast expense and greatly improves upon the first film's potent but rudimentary visual style. He has also broadened his initial idea to encompass better developed characters (after all, the first Terminator was barely verbal), a livelier wit and a more ambitious, if nuttier, message.",
    "What is notable, though, is the amount of compassion invested in the film by Cameron and co-screenwriter William Wisher. There's a fairly well-drawn moral message in T2 that was more or less absent in the first film.",
    "All the virtues of the original... are present here, though when Cameron tries to milk some sentiment out of the \"personality\" and fate of his top machine he comes up flat and empty, and the other characters are scarcely more interesting.",
    "If you change the course of history, the world will experience a different kind of chaos. That's a time-honored movie cliche. Terminator 2: Judgment Day chooses to go against that philosophy, noisily and with some monotony."

The machines that rule the future send back a cyborg, played by the terrifying Robert Patrick, whilst the humans send back their own cyborg to protect him. Schwarzenegger again excels in a role he was born to play, his voice and physique suiting his cyborg character perfectly.\r This all leads to a series of truly memorable action sequences that still largely stand up today in terms of special effects.

The plot is very well constructed, the acting (especially Arnold Schwarzennegger's Terminator) is top-notch and very memorable. The amount of depth each character has is just amazing and you identify with each character, there is such an emotional charge to each moment that you are sucked into the movie. The action scenes are top-notch and will keep you enthralled in it, there are many in the movie and suspense is well-maintained when needed as well. The movie is sure to be remembered and quoted every time for a long time (\"Hasta La Vista, Baby\"). Flaws, there are hardly any except for maybe it can be a bit lengthy and the action takes some time to get interesting but once it does it's awesome and it is a small flaw though. Overall, Terminater 2 is a smash-hit movie that is an example of a super-action flick deftly crafted with emotion that will be remembered forever and is almost as good as the first one.

If the first movie was good with Arnold being the evil Terminator hunting down the seemingly innocent Sarah Connor (while utilizing some very top notch special effects by 1984 standards,) this 1991 sequel is even better with Arnold being the good Terminator trying to prevent John Connor from being hunted down. This movie is well-placed, and focuses mainly on the three main characters, John, Sarah, and the now good Terminator as it should. This movie also gets high marks from me as it featured special effects that were WAY ahead of its time, courtesy of the new, evil Terminator that can regenerate its body, even when it's broken into dozens of pieces! This movie demonstrates that while we don't know for certain what is going to happen in the future, we are always in control of what happens in the present, and therefore, we all play a hand in shaping what the future will eventually have in store for us. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I highly recommend it to people looking for some great thrills!",

The first one I thought had better subtext about war and the dangers of technology, this one however does still have bits of that located in it somewhere, but is more focused on trying out new types of effects. Not that's bad, this has some of the best action out there. Some of the things I am disappointed about is the opening, it's the same as the last one, but doesn't have that same flare that it had. The effects overall in this film are quite entertaining and are still pretty good for todays standards. Arnold is still good, for not showing emotion, but the scenes where they try to insert humor for him don't always work. Unfortunately I think that this is one of Arnolds last movies that he stars in and does well, afterwards is a steady decline. The main cast does pretty well to, definitely some believable characters. The villain is really good in this, even though it's a clone of Arnolds performance in a way, he's very imposing and at times scary. This is definitely a awesome movie, but compared to the last one it's just not as well written.",

It had a good mixture of action, character development withOne of the best movie sequels of all time and it earned its place in movie / pop culture history. It was carefully made, plays with expectations and delivers an amazing experience. It had a good mixture of action, character development with an immersive story. Lets start at the beginning: The Terminator was already a really good experience and the story could easily be continued. It is the standard Hollywood rule that if a movie is successful enough you get a sequel no matter what (Curse and blessing of the industry).  It took still quite a while until they started. A frequent reason I read were production issues and that the special effects technology was not good enough. However after solving the issues they could start. Luckily they get the best assets back with James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton atop of many people behind the screen. The story is set approx 10 years after the prequel. The supercomputer Skynet who is at war with humanity in the future sends another Terminator to get rid of John Connor who will lead the human resistance to victory. Again the resistance does send one of them back to stop the Terminator. This sounds firstly like a warmed up retelling or re-shoot of Terminator 1 but you will be surprised how good the story will become and how much effort was put into it (I am vague on purpose to avoid spoilers). The story itself has a lot of good ideas some twists and a mixture of action, story telling and character development / interaction that makes it hard to find flaws. Of cause you can find smarter solutions for Skynet to eliminate John like a virus pandemic or a high bounty to let ruthless humans do the hard work. However these are just thoughts or ideas and will not be used against the movie. I will continue with the actors. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns to his most iconic role and fully delivers. Same goes for Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor. She also fully delivers and got a lot of character development.  Then we got Robert Patrick who is the best addition to the movie. Edward Furlong as (young) John Connor is one of the few good child actors that also started successful career later. He is absolutely believable and relatable. I want to point out for the rest of the cast that there is not one missed scene or awkward acting moment I can remember. Everything fits into the narrative and I think I should praise James Cameron as director (also writer and producer). Visually the movie sets new standards for its time. Be it the sets or especially the special effects. While some special effects look not that impressing today they were amazing and baffled the audience. Then there are of cause the action sequences and they do nothing halfhearted. Often I hold my breath because these were so intense, immersive and entertaining. The stunt team deserves credits. Overall this is rightfully named as one of the best sequels of all times and outclasses the prequel. It is one of the most well know movies of all time, pop culture legend and so carefully made that it is easy to recommend. It is the best of the franchise and the kind of movie all later installments try to reach or surpass (Hint: They never came close again).",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThe sequel of The Terminator (1984) was way better than I expected. Because of the ratings in many websites like Rotten Tomatoes, the first one (100%) was rated higher than this one, the sequel (93%), also in Metacritic was the same, Terminator in 1984 got 84% and Judgment Day just got 75%. Metacritic rated so terribly. But in IMDb was fair. The Terminator Saga is one of the franchises that had its sequel better the the original like the Spider-Man Trilogy directed by Sam Raimi or the X-Men franchise.  Schwarzenegger was still T-800 but with a different mission. The last time we saw him as a villain, well in here he was sent to protect Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton)’s son, John Connor (Edward Furlong) who would lead an army to destroy the machines in the future. He was still a kid that time but his performance wasn’t bad. He was great with different emotions and good acting. In here, I liked Hamilton’s performance more than the previous film, she was a mother, a badass fighter and she was addicted to cigarettes. I also loved the way she looked but I didn’t like the way she got drunk. Schwarzenegger just got much better. In here, there’s a new villain called the T-1000 played by Robert Patrick, a better and more modern prototype. He could morph into liquid metal and used his hand as various weapons. The way the CGI was edited was really awesome. The cinematography was great as well. It was filled with a lot of great and classic moments. The action sequence here was a lot better, especially the liquid metal (I’ve already mentioned that) and the battle between the good guys and the SWAT. The CGI was well-edited there with lots of shooting and explosions caused by Schwarzenegger’s T-800.  The strong violence and sci-fi actions didn’t really make this move deserve an R-Rated. It was totally safe for 13 and 14 year-olds. I didn’t  see anything too bloody, just T-800 cutting his arm, that’s it. I really didn’t like the idea the the whole Terminator Saga would be rated R. It’s just sci-fi, actions and little violence.  Nobody would be afraid, they’re gonna like it. That’s something I don’t like about the movie and the rest of the Saga. The final battle was extremely epic when T-1000 knocked down T-800 and then Sarah came to knock some of T-1000’s ass. Then T-800 came up lying on a giant clockwork and holding a rifle that caused destruction shot at T-1000 and he fell into the lava (maybe?) and melted. The way the villain died was just so satisfying.  This is one of James Cameron’s masterpieces of sci-fi. He got really good with the CGI and I’m looking forward to see the 3-D version of Judgment Day released in 2017 with better cinematography and maybe I could feel that I’m in there. This one was definitely my favorite of the Terminator Saga.Ratings: 9.4/10",

The film overdoes it in the action, recycles some plot elements, and isn’t as paced as well as its predecessor. The film gets a pass though as it doesn’t suck. With a film having the exact same premise and in some cases being strikingly similar to the last Terminator film it would’ve been so easy for this to feel like a lazy rehash especially with the overblown action but it handled it well. Had the film really delved deeper into the characters and its idea of controlling fate this could’ve been a pretty good movie and maybe even surprised the first. As it is its ok. I’m glad I saw that but the excessive non-stop action and at times too familiar story prevented me from getting as invested in this film as the first one.",

A brilliant action film that is perfectly directed by James Cameron, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is well ahead of its time in terms of special effects and is overall just a  very well done and very entertaining spectacle. Arnold Schwarzenegger is great here as the Terminator and Linda Hamilton is very strong as Sarah Connor. The child actor who plays John Connor is pretty spotty and the film itself can be a little campy at times, but it never fails to entertain. Beautifully filmed action sequences combine with good drama here to make a very good film that is also very well written and quite funny at times. Terminator 2: Judgment Day is what big budget action movies should look and feel like.",

T1 starring Michael Biehn, come on i love him in farcry3 Bloodragon but he isn't quite Daniel Day Lewis. More of a joke is how the trainwreck they call T3 starring \"fierce\" female terminator and poor casting can even come close (within  2 points) of T2. T2 writes one of the best sci fi tales ever written and executes it with flawless success depicting a stunning Sarah Conner conflicted and beaten with only two goals before she expires, protecting future leader of the resistance and son John Conner, and stopping Skynet. With a decadent soundtrack featuring a 90's who's who in rock (Guns n Roses ect.) it is sure to bring any nostalgic gen exer back to their hay day. The action was top knotch and the special effects were truly groundbreaking and still hold up today. What makes the movie epic is the character development and the conflicting relationship triangle with the almost father like role the terminator plays to John Conner who in turn attempts to humanize the robot, and the stowed away hatred Sarah Conner still has for their kind after the events of T1. In the movie Sarah often has flashes of a future nuclear explosion induced by Skynet which dramatically envelopes her and the world which they describe as \"D day\", these moments can be moving and intense. The story eludes to a future war between the machines \"Skynet\" and what little is left of man after D day with the human resistance led by \"son\" John Conner. The sci fi aspect and the dichotomy between man and machine \"what it is to be human\" is truly engaging and well explored. This film is more than the candy coated paint job and explosions, it is gushing with 90's mystique and cold hard style to go with a touchingly dramatic and interesting story. T2 will always define the genre and has inspired many and spawned a legion of imitators, but none as good as the original.......... or should i say the original sequel. T2 will live forever and is a true work of art by artists at the peak of their game.",

And rightly so, Terminator 2 is a masterpiece and is definitely one of the greatest action movies of all time and to me one of my favorite films ever made. Now, to the review, i shall briefly explain the different reasons why i have rated the film a 10/10. I would always say that the main reason this film is amazing is its impeccable pace, and that the film has incredible action sequences, dramatic storytelling and that it creates emotional connections between you and the characters. I mean, if you care about a machine more than the human characters then you know that the film is something special. And that is exactly why i have always loved the movie. Secondly, i always have admired the amazing effects used by James Cameron and that they still stand strong against other action movies today. The detail when the T-1000 is shot, and when he changes into his original form, it never fails to amaze me and it remains as some of the best special effects ever used. To conclude, Terminator 2 is one of the best action films of all time and one of the best films i have ever seen. It has incredible action, great effects, amazing storytelling and a great soundtrack. And honestly it is one of the movies that still shines today. Lastly, remember not to trust critics with deciding whether you should watch a film, users are always more reliable.

The film's box office performance, while more than justifying the movie's understated $6.5 million budget, did not result in studio executives rushing to Cameron to make a follow-up. However, The Terminator arrived on tape just as the mid-'80s home video revolution was gathering steam, and it became one of a few titles whose VHS success oustripped its theatrical performance. By the late 1980s, there was no question that Cameron would make a Terminator sequel. The only mystery was how spectacular it would be. Aliens, Cameron's first big-budget directorial assignment, had been an edge-of-the-seat ride and indications were that he had every intention of topping it with Terminator 2. (In between Aliens and T2, Cameron made The Abyss, a film plagued by production issues that received a lukewarm initial reception but was re-evaluated once a more complete version of the director's vision was released for home viewing.)\r For T2, Cameron's planed \"major twist\" was unveiled before the movie's release because of marketing considerations. This time, Arnold Schwarzenegger would portray a good Terminator instead of a bad one. Had this been kept a secret, it would have packed a wallop. Unfortunately, the trailers let the cat out of the bag and few (if any) members of the audience were unaware of this switch-up. Knowing the twist beforehand neither ruins the overall movie-going experience nor damages its integrity, but it's not unlike being aware of the identity of Luke's father while watching The Empire Strikes Back.\r T2 features bigger, bolder, more energetic action sequences than its predecessor (Cameron had a budget of more than ten times that of the original for the sequel). The big moments include a chase scene in which the T-1000, in a truck, pursues John Connor and his Terminator on a motorcycle; the prison break of Sarah Connor; and the explosive finale at Cyberdyne. The film is long enough to allow for more character development than in the original. We come to understand how her obsession with the future has transformed Sarah into a driven woman. A touching friendship develops between John and The Terminator, lending aspects of an off beat \"buddy movie\" to T2. And Miles Dyson (Joe Morton), the scientist/engineer unlocking the secrets of the 1984 Terminator's chip, must face the moral and ethical implications of what he is inadvertently doing. By trying to help mankind, is he instead becoming the author of its genocide? The time paradoxes addressed in this film are more complex than those in The Terminator. This storyline postulates that actions from the future have formed a cornerstone of the past, raising questions about the non-linear nature of time. Cameron's original ending for T2 would have made future sequels unlikely; producer Mario Kassar forced Cameron to abandon his planned \"coda\" to allow for the possibility of additional Terminator movies. Thus far, there have been two (plus a television series), but Cameron has not been involved, claiming the story he wanted to tell concluded at the end of T2.\r There's a little more humor in T2 than there was in The Terminator. Most of it results from the interaction between John and the Terminator, where the human child attempts to teach the robot killer the intricacies of offhand social interaction. This includes slang expressions such as \"Hasta la vista, baby.\" It's also worth noting that, although it would be a stretch to call Schwarzenegger's Terminator \"kinder and gentler\" in this film, he does not kill anyone. Even before John explicitly orders him not to commit murder, the Terminator's visit to the past lacks a body count. (The same cannot be said of the T-1000.) Of course, injury, intimidation, property damage, and general mayhem are exempted.\r Combined, the first two Terminator movies offer some of the best contemporary-based science fiction action ever provided in a motion picture series. Although the third Terminator movie continues the legacy of impressive, big budget action, the screenplay is lacking in both depth and substance and it feels inferior, especially when viewed back-to-back with Cameron's efforts. Although The Terminator is arguably the more visionary of the first two films, T2 is the more visually and viscerally satisfying. It's an exhausting experience and, even 18 years after its release (as I write this review), few films have matched it within the science fiction genre for sheer white-knuckle exhilaration.",

(In between Aliens and T2, Cameron made The Abyss, a film plagued by production issues that received a lukewarm initial reception but was re-evaluated once a more complete version of the director's vision was released for home viewing.)\r At the core of The Terminator lies the concept of time travel, with machines from the future returning to the past in an attempt to change it while future humans sought to retain the status quo. For Terminator 2, Cameron changed the game. Once again, there are pro-human and anti-human factions tripping through time, but on this occasion, both sides have the same eventual goal: change the future. For Sarah Connor (an ultra-toned Linda Hamilton) and her 10-year old son, John (Edward Furlong), it's a chance to avert the coming apocalypse. However, for the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), the latest machine weapon, the mission is to kill the Connors. With those two eliminated, the future human resistance will be toothless, thereby assuring eventual machine dominance.\r For T2, Cameron's planed \"major twist\" was unveiled before the movie's release because of marketing considerations.

Perhaps the most notable of the inclusions is a dream sequence in which Sarah interacts with Kyle Reese. This sequence - the only one in T2 featuring Michael Biehn - provides stronger connective tissue between The Terminator and its immediate sequel.\r Combined, the first two Terminator movies offer some of the best contemporary-based science fiction action ever provided in a motion picture series.
