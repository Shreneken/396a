  "critic_reviews": [
    "Damn, damn funny.",
    "Hawks powers through all of this, keeping his performers busy with a torrent of one-liners and physical comedy moves that only the extremely talented could even hope to grapple with. It's perfect.",
    "Bringing Up Baby is very funny. It leaves one in awe at the speed and timing of Grant and Hepburn, as well as their goofy, lopsided humanity...Don't trust the public to recognise a masterpiece.",
    "One of the finest screwball comedies ever...Fast, furious and very, very funny.",
    "Time has revealed its brilliance, as well as the apparent impossibility of its like ever being seen again.",
    "A delightful piece of utter absurdity and one of director Hawks' most inspired lampoons of the battle between the sexes. Hepburn and Grant are superb in this breathlessly funny screwball comedy with a plot that could have been hatched in a mental institution.",
    "The quintessential screwball comedy.",
    "The movie takes risks that Hollywood isn't even aware of anymore.",
    "As Hawks admits, Bringing Up Baby isn’t a perfect film. But there’s an undeniable, ephemeral magic that comes from watching him, Hepburn, and Grant all work together on such a madcap story.",
    "Having already helped launch the genre, the director Howard Hawks here reinvents his comic voice, establishing archetypes of theme and performance that still hold sway.",
    "Bringing Up Baby is constructed for maximum of laughs, with Ruggles and Catlett adding to the starring team’s zany antics. There is little rhyme or reason to most of the action, but it’s all highly palatable.",
    "Bringing Up Baby has some delightfully comic sequences, for sure. But I’m less inclined to remember the dynamics of the gag than Grant and Hepburn’s timing.",
    "After the first five minutes of the Music Hall's new show - we needed those five to orient ourselves - we were content to play the game called \"the cliche expert goes to the movies\" and we are not at all proud to report that we scored 100 per cent against Dudley Nichols, Hagar Wilde and Howard Hawks, who wrote and produced the quiz. Of course, if you've never been to the movies, Bringing Up Baby will be all new to you - a zany-idden product of the goofy farce school. But who hasn't been to the movies?"

For, as far as filmmaking is concerned, there are scenes projected in here, that might drop your jaw. The director Howard Hawks must be a good comedian. Since what he finds funny might not marginally come under everyone's jurisdiction. Let us first give the respect to the visual department. How smartly have they pulled off some imageries. For instance, a dog fighting a leopard or in that case anything with leopard. Just like, George Lucas used efficiently productive methods on set to create a whole new world, Hawks is tricking you nicely.Maybe these are the moments that led the industry to use more artificial things or sprinkle something post production, hence films like Wings makes you challenge yourself. In plot, I'll tell you one thing, the irritation does communicate with me. There are loads of verbal sparrings and loud noises, it's like if Martin Scorsese met Aaron Sorkin and together they were on steroids. It can be too much, easily. The screenplay is smartly and highly detailed and still the gags are kept prior to the narration.No matter how well it is done, you can always tell apart after you are done with the film. The chemistry is another major note. It is off the hook and if you want to see a good example, watch them coordinate with each other in sync in the beginning of the party sequence. The issue that I had with was Cary Grant's character and not of Katherine Hepburn. He is the catalyst. She is one smart cookie in every situation. Just watch her get her way out of ticket, she knows what she is doing. Bringing Up Baby is actually a \"how to not\" novel, and unfortunately \"how tos\" are not my thing.",
