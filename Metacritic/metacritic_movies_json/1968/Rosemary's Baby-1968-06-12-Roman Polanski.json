  "critic_reviews": [
    "The brilliance of the film comes more from Polanski's direction, and from a series of genuinely inspired performances, than from the original story.",
    "Rosemary’s Baby is one of horror cinema’s all-time slow burns, drawing viewers gradually into entertaining the possibility that the movie’s series of strange coincidences and accumulating sense of dread are only subjective representations of Rosemary’s unraveling mental state.",
    "As Polanski leads the audience step-by-step through Levin’s queasy plot, he pushes them toward a conclusion straight out of a Louvin Brothers gospel song. Oh yes, brethren: Satan is real.",
    "This is horror rooted not in misty Carpathian castles, but in recognisable modern life, with the satanists depicted not as outlandish fiends but the sort of everyday folk you might encounter on any urban street.",
    "A supremely intelligent and convincing adaptation of Ira Levin's Satanist thriller.",
    "A very sophisticated, very effective piece of work spun from primal images, with an excellent cast.",
    "Truly frightening because so much of it is so plausible, ROSEMARY'S BABY is one of the finest examples of modern horror, a milestone in the evolution of the genre. Although the subject matter is ultimately supernatural, the treatment is very realistic.",
    "Much of the movie’s revolutionary impact should be credited to the city itself: The Dakota looms menacingly, every bit the Gothic pile as any Transylvanian vampire’s mansion.",
    "Several exhilarating milestones are achieved in Rosemary's Baby, an excellent film version of Ira Levin's diabolical chiller novel. Writer-director Roman Polanski has triumphed in his first US-made pic. The film holds attention without explicit violence or gore.",
    "Using New York’s famed apartment house the Dakota for all its cavernous shadowiness, and exploiting the 23-year-old Farrow’s tremulous space-child vulnerability to underscore her terror and solitude, Polanski worked with an elegant restraint that less talented filmmakers have been trying to mimic ever since.",
    "These minor lapses, though, do not seriously affect the bewitching qualities of the film—which, in addition to being superb suspense, is a wicked argument against planned parenthood.",
    "Polanski’s direction is smooth and the film itself happily understated. The tension created is practically unbearable.",
    "It's that smile playing on Rosemary's lips, suggesting that her maternal instinct and the conspirators' hold on this vapid baby doll have prevailed, that provides the biggest chill.",
    "Miss Farrow is quite marvelous, pale, suffering, almost constantly on-screen in a difficult role that requires her to be learning for almost two hours what the audience has guessed from the start...Everyone else is fine, but the movie—although it is pleasant—doesn't quite work on any of its dark or powerful terms."

Roman Polanski's smart adaptation with perfect editing is something to explore in it as it demands attention from the first frame. His work on execution too, is appreciative if not completely justified considering the potential of the script. On performance, Mia Farrow grows on you as it ages on screen but unfortunately isn't supported well enough except for Ruth Gordon's stellar performance. Rosemary's Baby is a smart take on its genre, for it may go into places where one has been before but still doesn't use the clichéd formula like appalling creatures or hide and seek show or a typical altered ego.",

This film is probably one of the most notorious andRoman Polanski is a classic and his long career has consecrated him as one of the most influential directors of the twentieth century, although I don't have any sympathy for him as a person. This film is probably one of the most notorious and acclaimed of his career, and rightly so. When it debuted, in the late sixties, it was scary and I fully understand why. More than other horror movies so far, it used the permanent tension to keep the audience in absolute discomfort, not to mention that danger around a baby is something that touches the emotional side of anyone. It's something innate. The story takes place in an apartment building and revolves around Rosemary, a young woman who impregnates after having had a mysterious nightmare, when something possessed her sexually. Finally, other revelations, and the attitudes of a couple of elderly seemingly loving neighbors, convince her that she expects a son of the Devil, the Antichrist himself. Terrifying, is not? With such a good script it was easy to succeed, especially when Polanski so cleverly uses visual and sound effects as well as cinematography, misty and dense. Everything was thoughtfully designed to make us tense. Rape scenes are worthy of anthology. Today, by themselves, they don't scare us, horror movies have been so full of gore and blood that these scenes have lost their strength, but if we embed them in the film, they contribute a lot to our discomfort. Mia Farrow was at the highest level during the film, perhaps the most controversial of her career, since neither her husband supported her. Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon glared at the Castevets, the movie's villains. John Cassavetes is more restrained but does very well with his role. At present, this movie may not scare you as much as it scared you in the past, everything has its expiration date, but it remains one of the great classics of horror and must have a place on the shelf of any lover of this movie genre.",

Mia Farrow asRosemary's Baby is a horror film made in 1968 and directed by Roman Polanski but whether it's a drama aswell as a horror I don't know however that would explain the slow acted pace and countless conversations in the film. Mia Farrow as Rosemary was odd at times but I personally think she did a great job in her role and she's genuinely a great actress but there's a few problems with Rosemary's Baby. For starters you never see the baby or any baby but there's scenes where you know she's pregnant and what's going on and secondly the story makes no sense. Another bad thing is the film has a rotten ending and makes little sense at all, the plots all over the place, some of the characters are weak and some of the acting is shabby. For a horror film to work you don't necessarily need blood and guts or a dude going round stabbing people but you do need something to grab the audience's attention and to shock or scare and Rosemary's Baby had nothing. Rosemary's Baby felt like a drama all the way through and nothing in the movie suggests it's a horror movie and at times it's very boring and mainly focuses on a plot against the baby which gets tedious and pointless conversations that never stop or stop and hop to some more dialog and conversations. There's no blood in Rosemary's Baby except for the death of some woman which is very little, no suspense, tension, no shocks, twists, nothing and certainly nothing scary about it because it feels like a long drama film mainly just consisting of conspiracy's or conspiracy theories and conversations after conversations. It's a long and tedious film at times and I wasn't impressed especially for a horror and this film is plain bad. Not even Mia Farrow can save this in my eyes and Roman Polanski can't make horrors. Simple as that and sadly Rosemary's Baby is a tragic film that is basically a road to nowhere. The films beautifully directed and some of it's enjoyable but it gets dull and overlong with very little to keep the viewer interested if anything only to throw down one of the worst and stupidest endings in movie history which disappoints and your left wondering is this the final climax I waited for? Like I said, road to nowhere and personally this film is neither scary, terrifying or anything and can get boring.",

Here is the other part that is kinda sick, there is basically a rape scene in the film and if you know anything about Mr. Polanski, well watching that part in 2019 was a little strange.  I think this is one of the films where if you mention it around other film lovers they will say how great it is, but if you were to really ask them about a certain scene (example the stupid ending)they would have no response because they probably have never watched it and just read a critics review in order to fit in.",

Probably a bit oversaturated and tinny compared to modern releases. Interesting idea and probably well done at the time but it is too subtle since the seventies graphic intense revolution. Problem is that it is not that scary. It should be because her neighbours worship the devil and recruit her husband. Not only that but you are raped by the devil and forced to gestate its only child. There are secret doors and crazy drugs and sects but it is all underplayed so that it is not scary, creepy or has suspense. For shame! Even The Omen (1976) executes the idea better. If you can get past how much it is underplayed it would be quite good.",

Mia Farrow is good, but the other actors seem like they're making a completely different, surreal, psychedelic film.The plot is virtually non-existent for the 2 hour 17 minute duration, so it's empty, and the acting is often so hammy it just seems unbelievably creepy and weird, but not in a way beneficial to the film.When it comes to devil-baby films your go-to should always be 'The Omen' (Donner, 1976), and the sequels of the trilogy - the Oscar-winning score from Jerry Goldsmith is truly disturbing.8.2/10 user review average?!
