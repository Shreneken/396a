  "summary": "There is panic throughout the nation as the dead suddenly come back to life. The film follows a group of characters who barricade themselves in an old farmhouse in an attempt to remain safe from these flesh eating monsters.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "This is the great American nightmare, in which neither families, friends, neighbors, nor lovers can save you, and no matter what you try and no matter where you go, it won’t stop until you do. There is nothing more terrifying than that.",
    "A stark, eerie and unrelenting parable of dread. There’s a brute force in Night of the Living Dead that catches one in the throat.",
    "Part of its strength is that it’s not a glossy, predictable Hollywood horror and so it has a grainy, semi-amateur, black and white look which gives it a dread sense of conviction.",
    "Dead is a movie you want to dismiss as another, gross supernatural B-movie: campy fun. But, shot and edited by Romero himself, the film is an astounding technical knockout, often so expressionist that the daylight seems afraid of the dark. The horror is so unalloyed that dead look decidedly, frighteningly human.",
    "Whenever it seems there might be a glimmer of hope, Romero cruelly reverses our expectations. The nihilistic ending, in particular, has to be seen to be believed. Chuckle, if you can, during the first few minutes; because after that laughter catches in the throat as the clammy hand of terror tightens its grip.",
    "Due more to how it makes you think rather than to what it shows, Night of the Living Dead gets under your skin and burrows into your blood and psyche.",
    "It remains a nightmare experience that’s not easily brushed off. And despite its ramshackle scrappiness in production terms, and some dated gender politics, the storytelling is first class, pitching us straight into the action, but only revealing its full hand gradually.",
    "Made for pennies in Pittsburgh. Its premise—the unburied dead arise and eat the living—is a powerful combination of the fantastic and the dumbly literal. Over its short, furious course, the picture violates so many strong taboos—cannibalism, incest, necrophilia—that it leaves audiences giddy and hysterical.",
    "Witness as the African-American protagonist (who has kept the panicked survivors alive) meets a fate that has more to do with prejudice than carnivorous appetites. Sometimes reality can be as brutal as any nightmare alternative in celluloid.",
    "Romero’s zombies are terrifying in black and white, but one could even argue who was the true monster in the movie: the undead or the living?",
    "Up until 1968, horror had been escapist. But Night of the Living Dead made horror serious business.",
    "The movie had stopped being delightfully scary about halfway through, and had become unexpectedly terrifying. There was a little girl across the aisle from me, maybe nine years old, who was sitting very still in her seat and crying.",
    "The definitive zombie picture.",
    "Despite mostly unprofessional acting, near nonexistent production values, homemade special effects, and cheap grainy black-and-white film stock, the film is a triumph.",
    "Although pic’s basic premise is repellent – recently dead bodies are resurrected and begin killing human beings in order to eat their flesh – it is in execution that the film distastefully excels.",
    "Night of the Living Dead is a grainy little movie acted by what appear to be nonprofessional actors, who are besieged in a farm house by some other nonprofessional actors who stagger around, stiff-legged, pretending to be flesh-eating ghouls."

Watching it today some aspects such as the unconvincing zombies, mediocre acting and constant musical score playing throughout most scenes show the films age, and lessen it's impact somewhat, but it remains an effective example of the genre and its influence on subsequent TV and film is undeniable.",

There is no deal, nothing on the table, no table at all. Everything is up for grabs and burns.Night Of The Living DeadAmong many filmmakers achieving their own various milestones in their first project, this one could be the ideal example, the milestone of that sub genre list- if there is any! The co-writer and director, George A. Romero has a poetic speech. Even rhyming, I would persist. Leaving all the evolutions of ghouls or zombies or whatnot aside, I would like to focus on the structure of the script. It is better if you understand the intentional poem behind all the scenarios in order to truly enjoy this could-arguably-be called popcorn flick. But there is much more than entertainment. Yes, you will get the occasional scare, the hair pulling annoyance to not be able to control and a classic game of pitting one chip against another. But this is one page poem. Written with a mirroring symmetry. It has a start and a finish. Something you won't be able to differentiate. And all the elements in the script is brimming with this ingredient. The dialogues, the intentions, the faulty logistics, worn out philosophises and now even the political incorrectness, some might point out. If someone doesn't get along they would start their equation through that very formula. And even end on it. Their salvation relies upon each other's theories and so does damnation, but then there is arrogance in the air. This eye-for-actually-nothing world hungrily feeds on upright abusive nature. The drapes are off and the humility, sociality comes off shamelessly. The living is scarier than dead ever will be. For in this Night Of The Living Dead, your companions are not only dumb, cold, rancid species (just as you are) but also has a motif. Greedy motives. There always is. It is human to be. Not zombies.",

Movie is nicely shot and mostly well acted. Movie grabs your attention after 10-15 minutes of the beginning and it keeps you grab to the very end. The ending was expected but not in the way it way.It didn't have bloody scenes which we expect from every zombie movie. It instead depicted scenes of murder, death and cannibalism. The black and white footage involving blood and gore made the movie more effective.I would recommend this film to anybody interested in the art of film making and to those who enjoy the horror genre. Before watching the movie just keep one thing in mind; this was small budget movie of 1968 with new actors and it did great with all this.",

Every piece of popular zombie fiction, from movies to TV shows and comics and video games, owes there existence to this film. George Romero's innovative and groundbreaking vision laid the framework for countless years of undead entertainment. Every trope, idea, rule, and moral conundrum you'll see in all of the zombie content that has come out over the years and has yet to can be found here. It's amazing to watch this, think of when it came out, and still see how all zombie fiction is using the exact same ideas. So next time you  are watching an episode of The Walking Dead or playing some Zombies Mode in Call of Duty, just know that they wouldn't exist were it not for \"Night of the Living Dead.\"Of course it wouldn't matter that Romero did it first if he hadn't done it well. Night of the Living Dead holds up remarkably well after all these years. If anything, with the exception of (maybe) the low budget and some inexperienced acting, time might have actually improved this movie. It's black and white visuals, retro soundtrack, and to the basics approach add a tone and atmosphere to this that the refinements of the modern age can't always capture. I will admit that there is a lot of what I guess you could call empty space in the movie. The majority of the time is just watching the characters (mostly just Ben) board up the house they are trying to survive in. It isn't until the cast expands that the action really starts to get going. Like most zombie movies, the struggle survivors find between each other as the result of differing backgrounds and personality is just as large and dangerous to them as that of the undead hoards gathering just outside their defenses. One of the many examples I could cite to show you just how influential this movie was to the countless others of it's ilk that followed in suit.While the low budget, independent nature of the film is something of a two-edged sword, it's clear that one edge is much sharper than the other. Fortunately, it's the one the swordsman doesn't have to worry about cutting (or worse, impaling) himself on. Without a great deal of special effects to rely on, we actually get to see the cast really use tools like fire and such to survive. It's pretty amazing to see our lead use a legitimate torch indoors, smoke and all, on his was outside. It makes the situation more believable. Yes, he's not actually going out there to ward off zombies, but he is risking some burns with that flame. The movie might actually be even creepier due to this smaller scale as well. I particularly enjoyed how the zombies were portrayed without much makeup, making them look more like, well, people. It's their behavior that sets them apart. I also think the way Romero envisioned them is also neat. They are much smarter then what we normally see nowadays, as they have the gumption to do things use tools in basic ways. It's also worth noting how incredibly bleak things are. With it's unforgettable ending and disturbing basement scenes, this is a movie that will stick with you long after you've made it to the final screen. Unlike other zombie fiction, this one even gives us an idea as to what caused the dead to return to feast on the living. Night of the Living Dead is a piece of cinema history. A real game changer that is still influencing the world today. Even though the zombie craze has slowed down a bit as of recently, the undead are still dominating our world. Well, ladies and gentlemen this is where the outbreak started. The late, great George Romero has gone down in history for a reason. You really should check out this starting movie in a series that has still has the ability to enchant and chill even today. Zombie fan or not, horror fan or not, movie buff or not, if you consider yourself a fan of fine cinema then this a must watch. Not only is it historic, but it's also fantastic as well. One of the most important, influential, and just darn enjoyable horror movies ever created.",

La acción comienza en un cementerio de Pennsylvania, donde Barbara, después de ser atacada por un muerto viviente, huye hacia una granja. Allí también se ha refugiado Ben. Ambos construirán barricadas para defenderse de una multitud de despiadados zombies que sólo pueden ser vencidos con un golpe en la cabeza.Opinión:Creo que el haber visto tantas veces el remake de 1990 influyó demasiado en mi reciente percepción sobre la versión original ya que con respeto debo afirmar que el remake es fabuloso y aterrador incluso al día de hoy y la versión original si bien la encontré buenísima, pienso que no ha envejecido bien, pero para ser una película de 1968 de serie B está divina y adelantada a su tiempo.No me gustó que el personaje de Bárbara fuese tan sobreactuado en ciertas ocasiones y tan apagado en la mayoría de la película, cuando en la versión de 1990 pasa del miedo al empoderamiento con excelentes contrastes de actuación, pero bueno, supongo que son estereotipos de la época.Valoración:3.5 ⭐ de 5 ⭐",
