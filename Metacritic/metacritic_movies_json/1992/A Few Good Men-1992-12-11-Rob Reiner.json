    "summary": "One man is dead. Two are accused of murder. The entire Marine Corps is on trial.

    "critic_reviews": [
        "That the performances are uniformly outstanding is a tribute to Rob Reiner, who directs with masterly assurance, fusing suspense and character to create a movie that literally vibrates with energy.",
        "Like all courtroom dramas, A Few Good Men is gimmicky and synthetic. It's also an irresistible throwback to the sort of sharp-edged entertainment Hollywood once provided with regularity.",
        "Expert story construction and compelling thesping and direction make all the narrative elements pay off as if calculated by a precision instrument in which all the parts are working perfectly.",
        "An entertainment to be seen and appreciated in momentum. As such, it is constantly gripping",
        "This is a timeless thriller, a reminder of how stars who have been so average elsewhere can produce excellent \u2014 some career-best \u2014 work when given a decent script and a confident director.",
        "If anything, A Few Good Men errs by throwing almost too many elements, themes and moral debates into the mix thus, by default, they sometimes seem shallowly developed and overly simple. Then again, that perhaps allows them to connect with more universal experiences.",
        "About as understated as a 21-gun salute... What's missing is anything of Reiner himself.",
        "The film doesn't make us work, doesn't allow us to figure out things for ourselves, is afraid we'll miss things if they're not spelled out.",
        "The final scene, when Kaffee locks horns with Jessep, more than makes up for the predictability of what's come before.",
        "I'm usually a sucker for courtroom dramas, but Rob Reiner's highly mechanical filming by numbers of Aaron Sorkin's adaptation of his own cliched and fatuous Broadway play kept putting me to sleep.",
        "The performers are powerless to bring life to this moribund courtroom drama...a snoozer."

If they\"A Few Good Men\" is a 1992 courtroom drama film Directed by Rob Reiner and starring Tom Cruise. The story follows a young lawyer's plight to defend two marines accused of murder. Now I know just about everyone's heard of this film. If they haven't, they've at least heard of the line, \"You can't handle the truth!\" That line is just a snippet of the greatness that is weaved into this film. Starting off on a related note, the script is fantastic. Aaron Sorkin strikes again with his rapier wit and compelling dialogue. The story is a very compelling look at the military definitions of honor and loyalty and how they can sometimes become misinterpreted. Some of the lines in this film are also spectacularly memorable. However, while the screenplay is decidedly impressive, the most imposing aspect of this film is the performances within it. Every single actor in this film brought their best to the table, and it's because of the unbelievably captivating performance from Jack Nicholson that everyone else raised their bars. Nicholson's really only in this film for about 10 or 15 minutes, but man does he make those minutes count with his caustic and snide portrayal of Colonel Nathan R. Jessup. Again, it's his performance that caused everyone else in this film to bring their a-games, and holy crap did they. Tom Cruise, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Bacon, J.T. Walsh, Kiefer Sutherland, Demi Moore, all did unbelievable jobs with their respective characters. Even Wolfgang Bodison, a stagehand who had never acted before in his life, did a really beautiful job with his role. The aforementioned fact is a real testament to the seemingly limitless talent of Rob Reiner. After watching the special features of the film, you really get a good idea that Reiner forged an effective relationship with his actors and offered some acting tips of his own for their performances. Because this is such a character driven story, Reiner made a great choice in offering some of his own acting expertise to his cast. Overall, I felt that \"A Few Good Men\" was a really masterfully directed, beautifully written, unforgettably performed coatroom drama that is sure to impress anyone.",

This movie really amazes me with it's great actors and great storytelling. The characters are very intrrguing and captivating. Especially, Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson. With Jack, I think he gave an excellent performance (as usually), but isn't in this movie a whole lot. You only see him in the beginning and the end of the movie. But boy does he make up for his dissaperance when he yells out \"YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!\" That line right there is truly a tremendous quote and one of the biggest movie quotes of all time.

Anyway, I can see this car stopped at a red light about 100 yeards down the road, inside of which looks like 3 or 4 teenage boys hanging bare asses out the back and side windows to nobody in particular. So I drive up next to them to see what's what. The guys all dropped down, revealing a 70 year old woman at the wheel. At first, she's appears to be hiding her face, probably embarrassed by the boys.... Then all of a sudden, she looks right at me (and Lohnny, who is now transfixed), she sticks out her tongue much further than I thought possible (especially by this old lady), and she begins licking her lips, cheecks and brow in a slow, deranged fashion. I look over at Lohnny who by now has lost all color in his face, his eyes bulging like he'd seen a ghost. The light turns green and he yells, DRIVE!, so I drove. The most perverse, Texas Chainsaw Massacre Family moment in my young life. By the way, the movie was damned good, though.  \"YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!\"",

It has a great story, strong actors and an interesting moral / legal dilemma. The story evolves around an incident at the Guantanmo Bay Naval base in Cuba. A US Marine died after being attacked by two fellow Marines. However this could been ordered by an Officer as a Code Red that went wrong. A Code Red is a violent (extrajudicial) punishment inside the military. As sidenote: By research I found out it seems those really exist but were called \u201cBlanket party\u201d. Back to the movie. It is the task of 2 JAG lawyers to defend the suspects and find out the truth. I stop here to avoid spoilers. The story is immersive, has good twists and kept me engaged for the whole time. I normally do neither like or hate legal dramas but this one is a must see. A lot of my enjoyment aside the story and moral dilemma came from the actors. Tom Cruise, Demi Moore and Jack Nicholsen are amazing. But it ends not there as we got also Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Kevin Pollack and a lot of other talented actors. The combination of a great story and actors that fully deliver is a true strength. I think I have said enough.

I can't say I'm in any way an expert in the area but I did find it surprising that Guantanemo Bay was mentioned numerous times, given this film dates from the early 1990s and I suppose I assumed that facility was set up in the early 2000s, prior to, or just following, 9/11. In any case, this film features a very solid cast and I'd say Jack Nicholsons performance was probably the best, in my view. It features the famous line of dialogue 'TRUTH?! YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!!' which I'd certainly heard of but I hadn't realised it came from this film. Its powerful at times, although it does drag a little in some scenes with Tom Cruises cocky, smug character trying to shrug some things off etc. That irritated me but I see the points I assume were intended given the script. I believe this film is based on the play by Aaron Sorkin and its, for the most part, a solid story. I liked that it includes the female character, Lt. Cdr. JoAnne Galloway, played by Demi Moore, who has to deal with men who aren't entirely keen on dealing with a female in a high rank like herself.I reckon its still quite a relevant film, given stories we hear nowadays about people serving in the army/navy etc. accused of things. Its a thought provoking watch and although it is a little slow in places, for a courtroom drama its by no means bad. Overall, yes I would recommend this film.",
