  "critic_reviews": [
    "Bold and stirring with impeccable production values, The Last of the Mohicans is a memorable motion picture adventure, and one of the best films of the year.",
    "The first hour of The Last of the Mohicans plays like a convoluted history lesson. I appreciate that Mann has enough respect for the audience's intelligence to sketch in this briar patch of conflicting loyalties. But he outlines the interlocking factions without really making it clear, in dramatic terms, what each one stands for.",
    "When this historical adventure kicks in, it's thrilling in the way old-fashioned epics used to be, but its romanticism has a fierce, violent physicality that gives it a distinctively modern stamp.",
    "[The Last of the Mohicans] blends pure adventure with a compelling central romance.",
    "The Last of the Mohicans is a striking mixture of the ersatz and the genuine. In other words, it’s vintage Hollywood. It’s also a smashingly entertaining and satisfying adventure.",
    "Mann, who's best known for such urban crime dramas as \"Vice\" and \"Manhunter,\" is equally at home whether the chase concerns a cigarette boat or a birch-bark canoe. He brings the same flair pairing action and style to The Last of the Mohicans, an attempt to resurrect and redefine the American hero.",
    "The Last of the Mohicans isn't a classic, but it's one of the most exciting action pictures to come along in recent memory.",
    "The Last of the Mohicans rarely flinches in depicting the eye-for-an-eye savagery of war. Although not explicit in the way you might expect, it nevertheless requires you to screw your courage to the sticking place. Perhaps that's a tribute to its ability to take you along its journey without much effort – real enough to elicit a visceral reaction, romantic enough to remind you it's only a movie.",
    "The Last of the Mohicans is not as authentic and uncompromised as it claims to be -- more of a matinee fantasy than it wants to admit -- but it is probably more entertaining as a result.",
    "Drawing upon the novel with merciful selectivity, and adding such a contemporary flavor that the film's woodsmen often have a laid-back air, Michael Mann has directed a sultrier and more pointedly responsible version of this story.",
    "The Last of the Mohicans comes at you like a tomahawk. Hard, fast and brutal, it slashes at your throat and just about leaves you for dead. Undeniably exciting as this definitely is, however, its impact comes at the expense of some of the gentler virtues, qualities that even top-drawer barn-burners really shouldn't ignore."

The uniforms, combat tactics, clothes, scenery, everything fits perfectly in the time and historical context that the film seeks to portray, and this is extraordinarily pleasing to people like me, who like to see a historically realistic film.The screenplay is based on an extremely famous novel by James Fenimore Cooper, although it did not faithfully follow the book. This may be good for dramatic effects, but it inevitably leads to choices and decisions that each viewer can judge good or bad. I, in particular, saw nothing that shocked me. Actors' work is very good, particularly Daniel Day Lewis, in the role of Hawkeye, a European who was adopted by a Mohican elder and grew up in Native American culture. We can consider this to be one of the most remarkable works of his career, opening the doors to a series of other projects where the actor would come to shine (\"Gangs of New York\", \"There Will Be Blood\" etc.) Madeleine Stowe was equally well in the role of Cora. Finally, a note of praise for the soundtrack of the film, of excellent quality.",

The conversations between the characters are slow and boring, and the film overall felt very slow and it didn't get my intrest.

(hélas). Voilà donc (déjà) qui ne laisse pas de déplaire considérablement. Quant au Mohican incarné ici par le sans peur et sans reproche Daniel Day-Lewis, pas un mauvais acteur au demeurant, son personnage fait davantage penser à un chevalier du Moyen Age, on ne peut plus ringard déjà à cette époque, de par sa colossale fatuité et naïveté. Bref, c'est un Amérindien de pacotille qui ne leur fait certainement pas honneur.Bien que l'action ne soit pas totalement absente, le film manque singulièrement de rythme et se perd en bavardages sirupeux inutiles et ennuyeux. Quant à l'action elle-même, sa mise en scène est plutôt brouillonne... même si on a vu pire (au royaume des aveugles etc). Un mot en passant sur la musique pédante et patriotique : une jolie musique pédante et patriotique.Devant tout ce fatras bien chiatique, je dois avouer que je n'ai pas tenu jusqu'au bout bien qu'à dire vrai je m'y attendisse (mon vieil instinct détecteur de daubes en puissance sans doute). Le Dernier etc... n'est pas totalement mauvais si l'on reste très bon public peu exigeant mais n'en reste pas moins... très mauvais en définitive.",

Mann is a more than competent director seen with the likes of Manhunter and Heat, and while everything you expect in a Michael Mann film is here(not a bad thing, quite the contrary) it is all done in a professional way.The story is a sprawling one, but again that is not a bad thing in itself. Because while it is sprawling in nature, it is also a compelling story lifted by its sweeping action sequences(notably the climax), the love story that is kept in the background but remains prominent and emphatic characters.The pace helps too, as while the film clocks in at just under two hours, Last of the Mohicans flies by with no scene feeling too rushed. I also appreciated that the quieter and more subtler moments, as seen with Russell Means' character, didn't drag.That's not all. The cinematography is splendid and the settings are stunning that gives the film its epic, sweeping feel. Trevor Jones' score is outstanding, and probably his best since The Dark Crystal.Last of the Mohicans has fine acting. Daniel Day-Lewis is a commanding lead, and Madeline Stowe is both alluring and convincing, likewise with Jodhi May. Russell Means is suitably composed, wise and well-meaning, but for me Wes Studi's marvellous and quite malevolent performance is the standout.All in all, a spellbinding film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Life was hard, times were tough, I never imagined this when I was studying American history in school.  You were on your own; how many of us could survive under these circumstances?  On top of that, war is on between the British, who the colonists live under, and the French, who have enlisted the Indians.  The settlers are at the mercy of both.  This movie gives a graphic portrayal of life during these times.  Great cinematography, great actors, great movie.  I don't have many DVDs but this one is in my collection.",

Ambush.The Last Of The MohicansMann's ruffian ideology is undoubtedly tough and on the other hand is incredibly brittle. This political thriller that was aspired to be thought provoking feels like you tuned in a prime time news show that grows into a preaching to the choir tone within its first act. It is a long tiring process that Michael Mann, the co-writers and director, wants you to be a part of, why? Also, I couldn't imagine a film confined in its doomed script to ever come off winning, this wannabe Lawrence Of Arabia lacks the romance between the audience and the character that David Lean made sure his film was fueled of.On the positive side, the hard work is transparent as water and pays off more than enough when it comes to create these behemoth action set pieces on such a large scale. Michael's passion and Daniel Day-Lewis's skin in the game makes all the effort worth. No matter how many times you find yourself watching the clock, you'd also want to see Daniel pouring his soul in on the magnanimous and generously fierce character. Madeleine Stowe and Russell Means is supporting Daniel and the film thoroughly to reach to a better end.The script mainly works on the duality of the war and not the characters, and after its first act, the film gets pretty simple and unbearingly hard to watch. There is a lot of political correctness in the film, which unfortunately is turned up a notch that often undermines the emotions these characters go through and its major asset, the one dramatic scene that it all hinges upon is the major victim of this disease. The Last Of The Mohicans feels more like an Oscar bait than a deep dive on a rich Americana culture.",

The colonizers are greedy and there is no more naivety in the host people because their presence is already part of the New World. Yet the division is still clear, with the invaders told to respect their duties and the indigenous people committed to safeguarding their rights. Daniel Day Lewis is as fantastic as usual here and score is astonishing. Fights are maybe too spectacularzed and a bit too distant from reality but this movie works well and deserves to be a classic.",
