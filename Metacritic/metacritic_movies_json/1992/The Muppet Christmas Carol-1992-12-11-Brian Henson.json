  "critic_reviews": [
    "As Scrooge, Michael Caine rises to the challenge and helps find the pathos beneath the puppetry.",
    "The Muppet Christmas Carol's warmth, wit and obvious affection for Dickens make it one of the greatest Christmas films – and literary adaptations – of all time.",
    "The Muppet Christmas Carol may be the most important Dickens adaptation of our time.",
    "Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy are joined by Caine as a hilarious Scrooge in this irresistibly sweet musical adaptation of Dickens’ festive tale.",
    "If you love Christmas movies, and especially if you have some young family members you wish to share your holiday with, you can't go wrong with The Muppet Christmas Carol.",
    "Vastly enjoyable despite the syrupy, soppy song bit in the middle (go make a glass of mulled wine during it). Michael Caine is perfect in the role and there are many genuine belly laughs.",
    "The three ghosts of Christmas are wonderful. Elsewhere, Fozzie Bear bears a resemblance to Francis L Sullivan in the David Lean Dickens adaptations, and there's a shop called Micklewhite. As an actor, Kermit can corrugate his forehead vertically. Good fun.",
    "This magical piece of family-friendly escapism could well be the perfect antidote to the influx of big budget commercialism which will inevitably saturate the local multiplexes during the festive season.",
    "Will kids like the movie? The kids around me in the theater seemed to, although more for the Muppets than for the cautionary tale of Scrooge.",
    "There's no great show of wit or tunefulness here, and the ingenious cross-generational touches are fairly rare. But there is a lively kiddie version of the Dickens tale, one that very young viewers ought to understand.",
    "This adaptation of Charles Dickens' Christmas classic is not as enchanting or amusing as the previous entries in the Muppet series. But nothing can really diminish the late Jim Henson's irresistibly appealing characters.",
    "Although The Muppet Christmas Carol doesn’t really work as an adaptation of the beloved Dickens novel or as a Muppet movie, it nevertheless works on its own terms for a niche audience. It’s the kind of high concept family film that can be carted out every Christmas season and enjoyed in the same way as “Frosty the Snowman”, “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer”, or “The Year without a Santa Claus.”",
    "A mixed bag of mixed moods. The somberness of Dickens's oft-filmed seasonal cautionary fable works at cross purposes with the Muppets, keeping their usual gentle anarchy at bay.",
    "The Muppet Christmas Carol\" isn't terrible, by any means. But it's resoundingly moderate, with merely passable songs by Paul Williams, and only occasional real laughter.",
    "A sadly dull and unimaginative outing.",
    "This is the dullest and least successful adaptation of the Christmas chestnut I've ever seen, possibly because the mixture of Muppets and humans creates anomalies of scale and degrees of stylized behavior that the film tries to ignore rather than work with."

The strengths are that it is a great adaptation with actors that fully deliver and that the Muppets add a lot to the movie. Each part complements the other and I did not expect that. “A Christmas Carol” by Charles Dickens is a timeless classic. The story of Ebenezer Scrooge is probably so famous that anyone knows it, have read it or seen/ listen an adaption. It is a story about the true values of Christmas, self reflection and being a better person. The Muppets also don’t need any introduction. Who does not know Kermit, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, Fozzie Bear and all the others. The story itself follows the events of the book really accurate and like I said the Muppets addition to the story as characters works far better then I would have imagined. The humor adds to the enjoyment of the story and movie. The human actors fully deliver and I will praise Michael Caine as Ebenezer Scrooge for an amazing performance. The puppetry for the Muppets is also great and they create immersion and emotions. Practical effects are sometimes far better than CGI. Overall this is an amazing movie and I don't know why it is forgotten even on Christmas. Worth to rewatch in the holiday times.",

Muppets Christmas Carol is wonderful, and deserves the high rating. I also think the rating for TreasureThe two best Muppet movies after Jim Henson's death are this and Muppets Treasure Island. The worst, I think is Muppets Wizard of Oz. Muppets Christmas Carol is wonderful, and deserves the high rating. I also think the rating for Treasure Island is too low, as I loved that film too.The Muppets are truly funny here, especially Gonzo and Rizzo, who have the funniest lines. Kermit and Miss Piggy were at their most touching here. Scrooge's encounter with the Marley Brothers was the highlight of the film for me. The high point of the movie is the performance of Michael Caine,(like Tim Curry in Treasure Island) who was the best he was in recent years, and his singing was passable. Very convincing! I personally think this is the funniest post Jim Henson Muppet movie, and was my favourite Christmas memory as a kid, and managed to stay true to the spirit of Christmas, and was heartwarming with the character of Tiny Tim. The songs, also, weren't that bad at all, but in comparison to the ones in Treasure Isaland, one or two of them are a little hit-and-miss, but that's just me, and that is my only negative! The incidental music was beautiful though.All in all, a wonderfully entertaining film, that has enough to satisfy Muppet fans. 9/10. Bethany Cox",
