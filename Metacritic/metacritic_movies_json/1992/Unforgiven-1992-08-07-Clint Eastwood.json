  "summary": "In this Academy Award winning western, Eastwood and Freeman are down-on-their-luck outlaws who pick up their guns one last time in order to collect a bounty offered by the vengeful prostitutes of remote Big Whiskey, Wyoming.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Unforgiven is a stark western in slow motion, obsessed with reflection, not action.",
    "Unforgiven brought the revisionist revenge film into the 1990s and, by extension, the 21st century",
    "Unforgiven is a high-caliber movie, a gripping and haunting work of art that should finally establish Eastwood as one of America’s best directors.",
    "Unforgiven is dedicated to \"Don\" (Siegel) and \"Sergio\" (Leone) and it is a sombre, insightful, genre-reinventing western, directed by a filmmaker acutely aware of the western’s history, its limitations and the dubious truths of its legends.",
    "Altogether, this is as fine a piece of craftsmanship as one could expect of Eastwood, with Hackman and I Freeman's performances standing out, and given the sombre tone there are entertaining surprises and even some good laughs to be had.",
    "A magnificent movie that transcends its familiar tale of a reformed gunman forced by circumstance to resume his violent ways.",
    "The film reflects a passing era even in its visual style.",
    "Like a shooter whose skill allows him to take careful aim with a rifle rather than going for the easy splatter of a buckshot, director Eastwood's big picture is suredly calibrated: He points your eye to the tiniest specs, the most telling and powerful parts of this moral panorama.",
    "Simultaneously heroic and nihilistic, reeking of myth but modern as they come, it is a Western for those who know and chrish the form, a film that resonates with the spirit of films past while staking out a territory quite its own. [7 Aug 1992]",
    "Clint Eastwood has crafted a tense, hard-edged, superbly dramatic yarn that is also an exceedingly intelligent meditation on the West, its myths and its heroes.",
    "The cast is universally strong. Hackman, Freeman and Harris don't do anything they haven't done before, but the roles suit their personae to a degree where they approach archetypal status.",
    "This dark, melancholic film is a reminder -- never more necessary than now -- of what the American cinema is capable of, in the way of expressing a mature, morally complex and challenging view of the world. [7 Aug 1992]",
    "Unforgiven is the most provocative western of Eastwood's career, and with Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris along for the ride, it's also the most potently acted.",
    "Unforgiven questions the rules of a macho genre, summing up and maybe atoning for the flinty violence that made Eastwood famous. [10 Aug 1992]",
    "But in the genre, as both a movie and a conscious addition to the ongoing celluloid Western mythology, the film is a masterpiece, a stunning and awe-inspiring statement.",
    "As great as the script and cinematography are (they are both unassailable), the real magic of Unforgiven is in the performances.",
    "Exults in the hard-riding romanticism of classic Westerns, but it takes revisionist stock too. It dismounts at places usually left in the dust -- the oppressed lot of women, the loneliness of untended children, adult illiteracy and the horrible last moments of the dying.",
    "One of Unforgiven's assets is the way it overturns conventions, taking the man who is typically the hero and making him the villain, while transforming the traditional bad guy into a sympathetic protagonist.",
    "The characters in Clint Eastwood's dark, rugged, perversely funny new Western are so seriously compromised that their flaws almost add up to a running gag.",
    "It is the last great Western ever made, and it will always remain so.",
    "Unforgiven... never quite fulfills the expectations it so carefully sets up. It doesn't exactly deny them, but the bloody confrontations that end the film appear to be purposely muted, more effective theoretically than dramatically.",
    "Only in its final minutes does it somewhat squander its grip on the moral imagination, in a climax that seems oddly to undercut all that's come before and return us to the hallowed sense of violence as cleansing which so animates the world's true killers.",
    "Plays out its drama with enough old-fashioned sobriety to lend the proceedings a classical air, offering the comfort of familiarity rather than the thrill of discovery. [13 Aug 1992]",
    "Each character in David Webb Peoples' dense, unexpectedly stately, non- violent script (the inevitable gore is employed sparingly) is treated with that same, somewhat distanced clarity.",
    "As enjoyable as most of Unforgiven is, Eastwood's shades-of-gray moralism feels like a whitewash.",
    "Individual scenes work, but the movie seems overstuffed-why is the Harris character necessary-and halting.",
    "As a moral reconsideration of the role of violence in previous Eastwood films, this is strong and sure, and characters who play against genre expectations give the film a provocative aftertaste. The only limitation, really, is that the picture hasn't much dramatic urgency apart from its revisionist context.",
    "If Eastwood had any emotional depth as an actor, the character's anguish might come through."

Carrément à la masse pour ne pas dire complètement à l'ouest, Clint abuse de son personnage limite handicapé sénile, quitte à en faire une caricature plus moins involontaire.Puis, officiant comme une campagne de recrutement pour la NRA, Papy fait le ménage tout-à-coup comme s'il venait de récupérer son taux de glucose (un Mars et ça repart), le tout très premier degré dans sa vengeance froide et se donnant comme toujours le beau rôle, même s'il paraît qu'il est le pire des affreux salopards que la terre ait jamais porté... et il se permet de faire passer le shérif (un peu brusque certes) pour l'anté-christ lui-même.Non, vraiment, ça ne tient pas debout, ni dans sa narration ni dans son traitement. Le film se traîne d'ailleurs un peu trop et radote comme un vieux con. Et si second degré il y a , il se borne à quelques clins d'oeil lourdauds destinés à faire mousser encore davantage notre inspecteur Harry Munny.Cela n'empêche pas totalement le film de faire illusion un certain temps de par sa mise en scène soignée malgré (ou grâce à) la parade permanente de Papy Clint (arrête de parader comme ça, je vais finir par avoir peur !) et l'excellente prestation de Gene Hackman, décidément un sacré acteur qui tire très souvent les marrons du feu.Impitoyable se révèle donc une coquille bien vide cannibalisée par l'immense ego de l'acteur qui a vidé de leur substance toutes les tentatives de raconter une histoire.",

And Eastwood was not only there to witness it, but in a way he was part of the change and might have even had a certain influence on it. For as the western changed, so did the roles Eastwood played in them. From the young impetuous Rowdy Yates in Rawhide, to the cynical anti-hero Nobody in the movies of Sergio Leone, to the even darker William \"Will\" Munn in Unforgiven. Munn might even been seen as a kind of aged Nobody, as Nobody might be seen as cynical version of the Rowdy Yates character.\r Unforgiven is a movie where black and white have melted together into a kind of muck color. The classical conflict between good and bad that was at the heart of the early westerns, where order was established out of the chaos by a single good man, never really occurs here because there is no such conflict and there is no such man.\r The story starts when a lady of the night giggles at a man's small pecker, in return he cuts her up with a knife. The owner of the establishment gets reimbursed for the damaged goods and loss of income, for a hooker with a ruined face doesn't sell, but the victim herself gets nothing for her pains. The sheriff, played by Gene Hackman, deems reimbursing to be good enough and leaves it at that.\r The prostitutes hit back by putting out a sum of a thousand dollars on the heads of the cowboy and his friend. The money is the macguffin that makes the story go.\rEnter various gunmen who want to collect on the bounty. One of them is Munn. Munn at first refused to go when asked by the Schofield Kid, but destitute as he is, and with two kids to feed and no wife to help out, he teams up with his old friend Ned and the Schofield Kid, a young man that boast of being deadly killer, for something that is basically an assassination job.\rThe sheriff doesn't hold kindly to the murders that drift into town and makes a point of getting this across by disarming them and beating them senseless.\r Nothing is neat and nice.The sheriff is hardly any better than the killers, roughing up any who defy his rules, even unwittingly, and he isn't even above killing to make clear who is the law.\rDying has lost all nobility. In the spaghetti western most people conveniently die with a shot or two, in this one cowboy gets it in the gut causing a prolonged anguished death struggle.\r Alcohol is the sign here.\rWhen the movie starts Munn has been sober for ten years. When the Schofield Kid ask Munn how it was in the old days, he answers that he wouldn't know because he was drunk all the time. The sheriff tells to a writer how a famous gun fight was actually nothing but an exchange of shots fired between totally pissed gunmen, one of whom shot his own toe off before being finished off by the winner, who ambled so close to his target that he couldn't possibly miss.\rThe killing gets to everyone and alcohol makes it possible: it is the sedater of choice.\r Perhaps this is as it was or perhaps not, but Eastwood never moralizes or explains. The movie is introduced by a voice reading out a text  that scrolls over the screen at the same time. It feels like a page from a history book. The movie ends that way as well.\r With Unforgiven the western has probably hit rock bottom.\rIt is the darkest of westerns.\rThis might be closer to history than any of the other westerns he played in.\rWho knows.\rIt might not be.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nWhen you think about Western Genre films, three things come to mind: gold-hearted heroes, black-hearted villains, and lots of action. This film reviewed here blurs those distinctions and leave the audience slightly unsettled in their stereotypical convictions. Unforgiven (1992) looks like a Western. It has many of the conventions of a Western. But it doesn't feel like one. The plot is saturated with moral ambiguity. The sheriff doesn’t act like the archetypical good guy, and the audience is inclined to root for the villains. There truly is only one gunfight and it is at the climax of the movie. All other shootouts are assassinations; dirty business atypical of western films. The violence is brutal and unpleasant to watch. If there is such a thing as a Noir-style Western, this is it. It shows the dark side of humanity in the old west. In fact, the film shows many dark sides: prostitution, cruelty to women, bold-faced lying, assassination of unarmed men, and merciless beatings.\rClint Eastwood plays William Munny, a retired gunman trying to raise his motherless children on a failing pig farm when he is approached for 'one last job' and the promise of a cash bounty on a pair of cowpokes who disfigured a young prostitute. He rides to the town of Little Big Whiskey with his old partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) and the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett). The small town of Big Whiskey is a typical frontier place, with a saloon, a whorehouse, and a few other small businesses. It is mercilessly controlled by incorruptible Sheriff “Little Bill” Daggett (Gene Hackman). The story is through the viewpoint of William Munny, he is naturally the most sympathetic character. It is important not to forget, however, that he is a seasoned killer who, in his day, murdered women and children in cold blood. And, while Little Bill may have a streak of cruelty running through his veins, he's a man of justice. One of Unforgiven's attractions is the way it overturns conventions, taking the man who is typically the hero and making him the villain, while transforming the traditional bad guy into a sympathetic protagonist. Initially, Munny fights against being drawn back into his old ways, insisting that \"I'm not the same person\" but, in the end, he reverts to what he was.\r Some viewers would want to believe he can change. From their standpoint, it's a sad transformation. The film’s climactic gunfight, which in many Westerns would be a moment of triumph, plays out with a note of unhappiness and morbid acceptance. Lawmen die and the killer rides out free. Those in the audience who thought they would see a western version of “Dirty Harry,” whose character persona was the embodiment of violence without consequences, a shoot-first, ask-questions-later mentality, were shocked to see Eastwood’s Unforgiven illustrating there is real consequences to violence  permanent moral penalties that a person lives with for the rest of his life. The only flaw to this line of thought is that Munny later becomes a successful storekeeper. How would that be possible for this regressed killer?\rClint Eastwood served as producer, director, and star, and had essentially complete control of the project. He won Oscars for both Best Picture and Best Director, and was nominated for Best Actor. Gene Hackman won as Best Supporting Actor, and there was an Oscar for Best Casting.\rUnforgiven, with its ethical complexity, could not have been made in the 1940s, 1950s or even the 1960s. It utterly destroys the romanticized myths of the old west.",

Clint Eastwood's direction is superb, and he is also exemplary in a suitably world-weary role. There is also some brilliant support playing, not only from Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris, but also especially from Gene Hackman.Unforgiven is also beautifully shot. The cinematography is wonderfully dark and autumnal, and the scenery and production values are breathtaking. The story is ceaselessly compelling and while Eastwood clearly dedicated the film to the likes of Sergio Leone, he replaces brutality with a greater emphasis on character and cause and effect, and doing that Eastwood successfully redefines the genre.There is also a wonderful script that does a fine job giving credibility to the characters. All in all, this film is brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

El no desea volver a esa vida, pero la necesidad puede con el y le toca volver a montar a su caballo, tomar sus armas y dar una aventura más. y así ya tenemos un desarrollo y un planteamiento muy directo y efectivo para que conozcamos a nuestro protagonista, pero Unforgiven  da otra sorpresa que no me esperaba y es su estructura.Unforgiven trabaja contra los pronósticos, es normal identificar por dónde van los tiros en la historia, predecir el siguiente movimiento pero está película se mueve de forma natural, alejándose de lo que esperamos, se nos introduce un personaje con todas las pintas de ser el villano principal, sus diálogos, su apariencia, un pequeño secuaz y una habilidad intimidante nos avisa “mira el sera el malo y da miedo” pero el guión se encarga construir todo esto para que una fuerza mayor derrumbe está imagen y naturalmente se crea un antagonista mucho más superior por  fuerza, por habilidad y por  astucia  es brillante, y la peli hace muchas veces esto, nos establece que nuestros protagonistas son imparables y que la edad no h mermado su habilidad pero nos demuestra todo lo contrario y esa es la riqueza de este western y como película, destruye convicciones comunes y construye más sobre estos cimientos.",

And yes, working with Sergio Leone for ages helped him a lot toNoted And Loved.UnforgivenEastwood has been the front runner of this genre from the very dawn. But what's fascinating in here is that this time he is the creator of it. And yes, working with Sergio Leone for ages helped him a lot to glorify this genre to its pinnacle. But with it, also comes the sheer pressure of respecting the genre that has given him royalty and respect for ages. Finesse takes over fear, in this case, and walking a fine line between cinematic style and hardcore substance, it is a thought provoking ecstasy to behold. This two part parallel western tale has three dimensional characters to be loved and be impressed with. But I would also call it, the darkest of the collection of Clint Eastwood films.Not only the followed content and the gore vision, but also the moral dilemma and typical bravery-cowardice antic it snatches from kid's story books. Holding that end of the bargain, is Morgan Freeman as an old skillful hitman, that is running from the in's and out's of the world for solace. His equation with a hothead amateur played by Jaime Wolvett shows some of the finest bickerings between two subsequent generations of all.Cloaking as an involuntary judge lies Clint Eastwood, the sort of anti-hero which everyone fears, even audience. But this is certainly one big distraction, for personally, Gene Hackman's version of corrupt power in hand, is the best door to knock on. From long intense sequences like capturing Richard Harris or seducing him for one last shot in the jail, some of the finest acting is to be seen from his account, if anyone gets in your nerves, it's him. Unforgiven is exactly what it claims to be, a memorable cast colliding with guns blazing in their hands and slick one-liners to make your head spinning.",

However, I decided to give this film a chance because IOne of the best westerns ever.I will begin my review by saying that I have never had western films in high regard or esteem. It's not the kind of movie that I really enjoy watching. However, I decided to give this film a chance because I heard about it very well. And I saw him thinking, \"If I don't really like this film at all, I'll never see a western again in my life.\" When I finished, I realized that I had really enjoyed the movie. It is not the best film I have ever seen and it will never be one of the favorite films, but it is really good and has changed the way I see western films.The film revolves around a brutal aggression against a prostitute: after a very embarrassing situation, a man attacked her with a razor and cut her face in an attack that made the other girls in the house cry out for blood. It turns out that the sheriff of the small town decided to be soft with the men and leave it at that. Given this attitude, prostitutes put the head of the attackers at a premium, and a series of bounty hunters is beginning to emerge, much to the dismay of the sheriff, who will have to brutally chase them away.For me, there are three essential characteristics that make this film truly great. The first is the effectiveness and credibility of the script, that is, the stripped-down, brutally realistic perspective that the story told gives us about the Wild West, which is a far cry from the epic and western-spaghetti. The script does not make idealizations and the characters are multidimensional and have many psychological nuances: violence is daily, brutal, ugly and the violent attitudes of the characters are motivated by cowardice, interest, greed or pride.The second characteristic that makes this film great is the exceptional work of each actor and, particularly, Clint Eastwood, who accumulates the roles of protagonist and director. He has an innate charisma and an overwhelming talent, and his character (a former brutal killer who regenerated out of love and lived a peaceful life with his children before being called for a final crime) is the richest and most difficult, as well as the gradual transformation she experiences throughout the film. On the other side of the law is the chameleon Gene Hackman, who brings the sheriff to life. He is perfect for the role and was able to fill his character with credibility and brutality. Much less pleasant was Jaimz Woolvett, but I think this is due to the fact that he plays a young, impulsive and boastful character. The film also features extraordinary contributions by Morgan Freeman, Saul Rubinek and Richard Harris.Technically, it is an impeccable film on several levels. Clint Eastwood is an excellent director and is very meticulous in his work. He makes good use of his long experience as a western film actor and uses it in a film he directs and where he acts. Cinematography is excellent, and the filming work was very well accomplished. The color, the light, the use of the shadows closer to the end, are details that give the film an artistic note. The editing and post-production work was excellent: the film has the right rhythm, there are no dead moments or scenes that arise out of place or seem out of place. The sets and costumes are also excellent and show some care and respect for the historical rigor and the reconstruction work of the time. The action and shooting scenes were very well done and will delight fans. Finally, I must leave a brief note to the soundtrack, very discreet but effective and totally in line with the tone and ambience of the film.",

As per Westerns in general, this is my second most favorite Western of all times, the first one being (obviously) \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" (1966). Besides this, this movie is one of the most worthy \"Best Picture\" recipient as well as one of the most worthy \"Best Director\" recipient in the history of Academy Awards. ..Good : As per Clint Eastwood's direction goes, it could've never been better. In fact, this is the best of Eastwood as a director and one of his bests as an actor, in particular, a Western role. Easily my most favorite Eastwood film. Clint is yet to make a bad Western. He knows how to make Westerns incredible. And in his (supposedly) final Western, both as a director and as an actor, he proves it. This movie has whatever a great Revisionist Western needs. You got some beautiful cinematography of the country side. Perhaps, the most beautiful views of the country side I have ever seen in a Western. All the main characters, William Munny, Ned Logan, Schofield Kid and Little Bill were very good. Little Bill was a very good villain and Will Munny was an incredible lead. Throughout the film, you can see people talking about Will's past time and again. They really helps you to get behind him. You can see the radical changes in him, after all that happened with him in the past 11 years. You can see his compassion and you'll definitely love the way he accepts that he's being evened for all the sins he's committed. And in the entire film, you get to see him feeling guilty for everything and his great transformation. Ned and Schofield Kid provide a very good support to the story, with unique characterizations of their own. Ned is in the same condition as Will is, but doesn't feel too guilty. The kid is just a moron who acts as if he is cool. I am not gonna say anything more about them, but these stuffs are played out very well in the film. Also, Little Bill isn't just your typical bad guy. What he does is pure evil, but he has got his own point of view. He isn't doing the stuff he does because a guy told him to! He did it because he hates assassins and murderers and all the \"low lives\". Also, he's a badass, and a whole plotline is there to show that. You hate him, but he's not all wrong either. Even we know about Skinny a lot from the first scene he is introduced. He is just a supporting character with a secondary role. Even he doesn't get overshadowed. Alice and Delilah also stand out, too. It wasn't too necessary to the story to point out how humble Delilah was, and the movie would've been completely good, as it didn't really contribute to the story. But that little touch in the character, gave the movie a slightly different and a better vibe. There are some clichéd plot points, but they can be easily given a pass because of the flow and pacing of the story. You get attached to every character in the scene, feel their emotions, feel sad if someone gets killed, horrified when someone is being tortured, and some tension building when Ned and Kid mess with each other. You feel what the characters are feeling, especially William Munny. There are some scenes that are mere plot devices and might have felt quite forced. But Eastwood directed it so cleverly that it doesn't even feel like happening. In the end, the transition to a particular plot device was really smooth and totally unforced. It feels more like a compulsion to the character. Also, notorious and sadistic, or not, the way that moment ends, does feel right. We get the badass Clint Eastwood we have loved from previous Westerns, and an epic line before he kills. Performances - incredible! Clint Eastwood embraces the character of William Munny and gives a powerful performance. Gene Hackman does a complete justice to the character of Little Bill. Jaimz Woolvett and Morgan Freeman give some of the most underrated and overlooked performances of all times. Hell, I can't even stop talking about this movie without praising the jobs of Frances Fisher, Anthony James and Anna Levine in the limited screen time they were given. You'd definitely know it's a great film, when you note that it was one of the inspirations for \"Logan\" (2017) - a superhero film. Not just a superhero film, but a completely different kind of a film in the X-Men franchise. And Logan itself was an incredible film for most of the part. This movie is one of the great \"hero with a guilt\" story. You get invested in every scene and every major characterization of the movie. Even the musical score is great and underappreciated. It is one of those rare films which deserves every Oscar it won. ..Conclusion : It may not hold up with Sergio Leone's classic Westerns, but is an incredible film in its own right. We get Eastwood being humble and a badass in his final Western role in perhaps the greatest Revisionist Western of all times. ..Rating. ..Score : absolute 10/10Grade : A+",
