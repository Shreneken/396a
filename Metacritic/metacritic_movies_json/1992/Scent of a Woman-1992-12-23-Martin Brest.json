  "summary": "Al Pacino won his first Best Actor Oscar for his brilliant portrayal of an overbearing, blind retired Lieutenant Colonel who hires a young guardian (O'Donnell), to assist him. It's a heart-wrenching and heartwarming tale of opposites attracting when they embark on a wild weekend trip that will change the lives of both men forever.  (Universal)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The good thing is that the principals and film makers make the absolute most of a conventional opportunity.",
    "By the end of Scent of a Woman, we have arrived at the usual conclusion of the coming-of-age movie, and the usual conclusion of the prep school movie. But rarely have we been taken there with so much intelligence and skill.",
    "If there's anything special about the film, it's that on this occasion, the emotional realism of the characters, especially Slade, is heartwrenchingly believable.",
    "In the end, Scent of a Woman offers little more than lumbering simulation of Rain Man's nimble magic. But Pacino's performance-scabrous, tender, ripely theatrical-is a master showman's trick.",
    "Thanks to a landmark performance by Al Pacino, SCENT OF A WOMAN is an agreeably watchable film. If they'd made it half an hour shorter and re-written the ending, it could have been a great one.",
    "This is a great performance from Pacino, who has the good luck here to work with Goldman's mostly wonderful, edgy script, but it might not become a beloved one because the man he plays is such a bitter pill.",
    "In the end, however, when all Pacino's demons are bared, they don't add up to the poignant punchline you were set up for. The movie seems to have two or three finales too many -- a disturbing trend in all too many films of late.",
    "This is acting that chills the heart beyond any possibility of warming.",
    "There's no denying that Pacino's performance is superb. The rest of the movie plays like a bunch of inconsequentially strung together sequences.",
    "Given the talent on board, there's an undeniable flair and effectiveness in certain scenes (such as Pacino dancing the tango with a stranger in a posh restaurant), but the meretricious calculation finally sticks in one's throat.",
    "The movie, however, is a crock.",
    "Instead, you get a nominal character study that boasts a single mighty performance and one nifty scene; alas, both performance and scene exist in a narrative vacuum - the plot is non-existent and the pace makes the ice age seem hasty."

Chris O Donnell for once appears not to be made out of mahogony, and give a restrained, yet powerful performance as the young student who acts as Pacino's carer.

      "content": "A poor High School boy that lives miles away from his family because of the rich school that he went, looking for the best in his future he got away from his city for that school called Baird. At the school he is a exemplary student and haveA poor High School boy that lives miles away from his family because of the rich school that he went, looking for the best in his future he got away from his city for that school called Baird. At the school he is a exemplary student and have some complicated colleagues that did some things that got him envolved. To get money for see his family at the christmas, the boy, named Charlie, find a job to take care of a war veteran with a peculiar style and visually impaired while his family travel during the thanksgiving and after that he will face a learning adventure with the unexpected happening for him.This is a story that does have a great plot, even that it is a story that doesn't happen very complex things, but you definely can learn some good stuff with it.Al Pacino acting is perfect playing the character of Frank Slade, he can absolutely pass the right idea that he is blind, you completely buy it, the moves that he does with his face and just never blink or even seem like he wants to. Also the fact that he portrays a veteran military that got crazy and lost is beautiful, he can make you feel that he is lost without the movie even telling you that yet, he also have the perfect tons of voices to give a lot of different feelings on him, he can be dominant and gross with the voice, giving orders like in the army, or when he feels useless for what happened during his life or even charming and intelligent, a character with multiple layers, Al was perfect in this movie. Chris O'Donnell also did a very good job, because his character is kind of low and innocent with a strong character, but he kind of is like you during the story, lost in what is happening and trying to help up somehow at some moments, i think he did a good job with his voice and purity. Gabrielle Anwar had a fast and small row in the movie, but she definely deserves some recognition as well, even with her few time, what she did was very nice, representing that woman with a life that she though that was alright, she with expressions in the face and with the hole body she could express how unsatisfied she was before and after the encounter with Frank, and also how great she felt while was with him, living a lifetime in a moment.The soundtrack of this movie is amazing, it does have a melody ta helps to put you inside of that movie and explain and expose what is going on with the characters, and does it with maestry with the character Frank Slade.There is one special scene that completely make this movie be something unic, the Tango dance scene is great, gorgeous and a teaching of how to treat a woman, the kindness in Pacino's voice and look, even that the character is blind, is unbelievable, the voice that he used in that moment and gracefulness were on point, the sequence have like 5 minutes and have a great quote in it as well.There is a clash scene that show how great of a actor Pacino is and how good was the job that O'Donnell did, the pain during the scene, and the attempt of saving and deliverance from both characters was insanely well directed and interpreted. You realise what is going on before the character, and that just make us tense and thoughtful of what could happen, there are a lot of tense scenes that just got me out of words during the movie. With moments of calm and despair from the same character trying to achieve his goal, are all great. AL Pacino transmits the pain and tiredness from his character. This scene is great also because it shows that even when you think you are useless in every part and nobody gives a damn, you can be great and not even notice it, in a bunch of different things.By the end of the movie, there is one of the best speeches in movies, when frank give a real talk about character, honor, integrity with so much love and without losing completely his lost mind, showing that the personage still himself even after he got cleaned up. He says that courage and honor are very important things to keep us fresh, to keep ours souls intacted, without selling it to the others. Speaking all of that in a engaging and passionate way, exposing his pain and weaknesses. During the movie also does have a nice teaching and quote metaphoric about mistaking in life and also keep trying, without fear of if things goes wrong, just keep dancing.There is one sequence that is necessary a poetic disbelief, for some could be a problem, but for me was nice. The car sequence was like one last shot, and a change of aspects in both characters, Charlie getting what was going on and trying to give Frank another breath of happiness and meaning, while Frank took it and did what he could, wich leaded to one of the best moments of the movie, the clash between them.For me this is a perfect movie, the acting won it all, the route of the character was great and leaded into something big and very dramatic at the best way, not just shocking, but also teaching. Damn good movie, WOOHAA!",

This is an elaborated scriptgrows like a family..Scent Of A WomanBrest's big wallop of drama is a triumph on the exploration of a single relationship that is weaved out with such eerie ingredients, that it doesn't some fictitious at all. This is an elaborated script and not a stretchy one, it knows the difference between two. Ticking for more than two and a half hours, it is a delight to watch it reach its destination. By the time it hits the last act, these two characters grows like a family to you. And just like them, they are flawed, morally challenged, emotionally driven and more human than any other.The structure of the script is your typical textbook one, even the process too is rudimentary but the journey is what sweetens the last victory. Brest is looking for glorifying tiny moments between the transition of the sequences and this is where he sweeps away the charm. Whether then be it to test drive a car or enjoy a dinner or stage a dance, his awareness and tactics of keeping the audience tangled in this aftermath bubble is sensational. The story itself follows like an epilogue of these characters and despite of being pathos, its evolution of growing out to be hopeful, is the actual trump card of the makers.Speaking of which, Pacino the real gem of the feature is a force to be reckoned with. His eyes, his dialogue delivery, his body language, his ho-ah, everything redefines acting. His performance alone has the potential to pull off this tale with fluidity. Supporting him on a parallel role O'Donnell is decent if not anything extraordinary. Brest never lets the emotions dry out, he keeps them on the surface and the audience on the edge of the seat through his brilliant execution skills. Scent Of A Woman manages to capture all your senses and keep it drawn towards the storytelling.",

Al Pacino's acting was just BRILLIANT and if he didn't win an Oscar for this the world would've gone mad. You are never going to see a film like this ever again. The title of this movie is \"Scent of a Woman\" where are you ever going to see something like that ever again? It just speaks to you; it's so soft and perfect. All you see today is superheroes and action packed explosion movies. There will never be a classic movie written in this present era ever. Nothing past the 1900s. The way they talk about women in this movie is so accurate; they make men like us go crazy over them. Al Pacino's acting in the plane scene where he talked about women was just brilliant. Women are one of gods greatest creations; ever. The hotel scene where Frank was going to kill himself was just an Oscar winning performance of its own. All you had to do was show that and it would make more than 100 million dollars. This movie teaches you so many things that you learn from Charlie and Frank. The scene with a meeting of the disciplinary committee and the whole student body showed how we should all be like Charlie. \"Never sell anybody out to buy your future\".",

Without him, this film would be nothing extraordinary. But, with him, it is elevated significantly. Overall, the story is ok and is somewhat compelling, but every line spoken by Pacino are a mixture of emotions. On the surface, many undeniably funny, but it is also hard-hittingly powerful or inspirational, while many of them are simply depressing, as he is a man who thinks he has no further purpose in life. On top of Pacino, Chris O'Donnell does a great job (as does Philip Seymour Hoffman in a small role RIP), making this even more of an acting showcase, rather than a superb film. However, regardless, the film is incredibly enjoyable and endearing as we learn to love Slade (much like Charlie) and all of his little quirks. Plus, his monologue at the end is absolutely phemomenal and really stands as one of the best monologues in film.\r On the negative side of things, it is a tad long. I love getting to see this much of their lives, but if it could be cut down to at least 2:10 rather than almost 2:40, it would be really beneficial. There is really no reason for this one to be so long. Otherwise, Scent of a Woman is a solid film that is lifted to new heights by a bravora performance from a living legend in Al Pacino who continously wows you throughout the film.",

HeThis film is very interesting and does not only have an analysis or a possible reading. It focuses on the experience of a young student (Chris O'Donnell) who accepts the job of taking care of a blind old man to earn some extra money. He reluctantly accepts the job after verifying that the old man is an army veteran, lieutenant colonel, and that his abrupt and rude manners would be difficult to bear. It gets worse when colonel decides to travel with his new \"recruit\" without care about his thoughts in these matter. However, they are not so different. Both show a tremendous sense of honor, duty, and dignity that permeates throughout the film at various times. This feeling, in a way, will allow both to understand each other better and establish a friendship. Another strong feature in the film is the enormous taste that the old colonel has for feminine companionship, and that is the origin of some of the most memorable phrases of the dialogues of the film.Chris O'Donnell and Al Pacino worked very well together, but Al Pacino dominates the film completely, with a delivery, a professionalism, a talent difficult to match. It is not surprising because he is already an established actor and with evidence given in the artistic world. However, in this film, he certainly got one of the most significant works of his career, along with the films of \"The Godfather\" trilogy. On a technical level, the film is fairly regular, but I would highlight cinematography, with a discreet but competent use of light and color, giving the film an elegant look that values ​​without distracting the audience from the story itself. And here is the story, the script, what counts and what matters. An edifying story, where values ​​and honor are at the heart of the plot.",
