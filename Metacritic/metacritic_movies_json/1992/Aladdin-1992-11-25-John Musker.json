  "critic_reviews": [
    "The movie that brought a hip new sensibility to animated features and which still stands up in the age of Pixar and DreamWorks thanks largely to a blistering improv turn from Robin Williams.",
    "Aladdin is a film of wonders. To see it is to be the smallest child, open-mouthed at the screen's sense of magic, as well as the most knowing adult, eager to laugh at some surprisingly sly humor.",
    "Despite a similar setting-the never-never land of the Arabian Nights — the new movie is hipper, faster, more topical.",
    "For the first time on the big screen, Williams' whirligig wit is totally unencumbered - and it isn't just free, it's supercharged by animation.",
    "Besides the in jokes, the animation and the Alan Menken score supply enough glorious entertainment to hold even brats and cynics in thrall.",
    "Aladdin is a magic carpet ride, a flight aboard a supersonic little Persian steered by all the wishes that ever were. Disney quite simply has outdone itself with this marvelous adaptation of the ancient fairy tale.",
    "It's the best animated fun of the year, and you don't need a lamp or a genie to enjoy it.",
    "Aladdin is a fairy tale with an edge--a popular children's story that will have even the most media-savvy parents straining to keep up with Williams's machine-gun delivery of quips, allusions and imitations.",
    "t's a movie for adults -- if they can keep up with its careering pace -- and, yes, you can take the kids. It juggles a '90s impudence with the old Disney swank and heart.",
    "This is a fun motion picture on all levels, and, while it doesn't quite measure up to the standard established by Beauty, it's still one of the year's best bets for pure entertainment.",
    "There's a good chance you're going to enjoy Aladdin more than the children.",
    "It's shallow as a puddle, but lots o' fun.",
    "A thoroughly satisfying musical-comedy romp.",
    "Floridly beautiful, shamelessly derivative and infused with an irreverent, sophisticated comic flair thanks to Robin Williams' vocal calisthenics, Aladdin probably won't equal its beastly predecessor but should still enjoy a magic carpet ride through the holiday season.",
    "Williams' shape-shifting, gag-spouting, celebrity-impersonating Genie is truly a hurricane in a bottle. His manic energy and hip humor are so exhilarating that the rest of the movie risks grinding to a halt whenever he's not onscreen.",
    "Aladdin is good but not great, with the exception of the Robin Williams sequences, which have a life and energy all their own.",
    "The animation seeks to dazzle, but with a self-consciousness that's relatively new to the Disney studio. The results are fun and fast moving, but far from sublime.",
    "Although the film in no way measures up to the features made under Disney's personal supervision, it does contain some far more imaginative and adept animation than the last several post-Walt titles.",
    "The fundamentals here go beyond first-rate: animation both gorgeous and thoughtful, several wonderful songs and a wealth of funny minor figures on the sidelines, practicing foolproof Disney tricks. Only when it comes to the basics of the story line does Aladdin encounter any difficulties.",
    "Visually, it's a treat, a perfect marriage of hi-tech graphics and the traditional Disney virtue of strong characterisation and colour. The script crackles with wit and life. Williams' Genie is matched by Freeman's malevolent Jafar, and by Gottfried as Jafar's wisecracking parrot Iago. The only disappointments are the wet Aladdin and his sweetheart Jasmine and five rather ordinary original songs.",
    "Aladdin is ultimately less offensive than patently ridiculous, mostly because its ethnic white noise is really just an excuse for Robin Williams—as a postmodern blabbermouthed genie who grants Aladdin three wishes—to put on the most elaborate, narcissistic circus act in the history of cinema."

      "content": "I decided to rewatch the animated version of Disney's Aladdin, since I had a very long time without doing so and specially that the 2019 live action remake is out and that now I see animated movies with different eyes than a couple yearsI decided to rewatch the animated version of Disney's Aladdin, since I had a very long time without doing so and specially that the 2019 live action remake is out and that now I see animated movies with different eyes than a couple years ago.Really this movie ain't anything groundbreaking in terms of storytelling for an animated movie, it's not a movie that will make your mind blow or a movie that you can get something from, but besides the not-so-great story and writing this is one of the best Disney movies from the \"Disney renaissance\" era. A simple and easy-to-follow plot with great humor, catchy and amazing musical numbers, breathtaking animation and charismatic characters.The best thing of this movie is its characters. They have charisma, clear goals and motivations and to me, and I think for many, the Genie steals the show, he's a funny comic relief that doesn't affect the tone of the movie, he just makes the movie a lot better and I guess that 99% of his lines made me laugh. Jaffar is a great example of how to make a good animated villain: He looks menacing thanks to clever character design, he has a clear goal that seeks to accomplish throughout the movie, he can be funny at times but not all the time to a point where the audience can't take him seriously, etc.The animation looks gorgeous too. This is Disney after all, the guys who established the 12 principles of animation. The color palette is vibrant and colorful, the character animation is fantastic and the CGI still holds up pretty well to be honest, this movie uses CGI correctly and as a result, we get some genuinely breathtaking visual effects.Overall, a great movie with some fantastic songs, great characters, good humor and gorgeous animation. Too bad the live action remake just couldn't reach the level of quality of this version and in some cases ended up being a lot worse and underwhelming.",

It is one of my favorite Disney movies and also one of the best movies for the Aladdin story. It is based on the famous “One Thousand and OneI have fond childhood memories of the movie as me and friends watched it in cinema back then. It is one of my favorite Disney movies and also one of the best movies for the Aladdin story. It is based on the famous “One Thousand and One Nights” where Scheherazade has to tell her husband Shahryar stories to avoid her demise (He is not evil but life has harmed him seriously). It is a mixture of stories from many genres and full of great tales and themes anyone recognizes. Aladdin is one of he most famous figures from this despite being not in the original (Added later). There are countless movies, stories and series about him as his tale is a timeless classic. The movie starts with a merchant who wants to sell an old lamp and tells the story of it. The rest I think I don't need to say as the themes are familiar. Anybody is familiar with the story and elements somehow. It is a great retelling with charming characters, great humor and so immersive you feel along with the characters. In this regard it is an amazing work and many see this as classic. It is the best Disney movie of the era. The animations were excellent and the style is unique and won the audience over. They capture the Arabian or Oriental setting really well and the facial animations deliver the full extent of the characters feelings. The other part are the voice actors which enhance this to a 11/10 ;-). Nearly everyone praises Robin Williams for his role as Genie and rightfully so. He alone is worth watching the movie. But it ends not there as Jonathan Freeman as Jafar, Scott Weinger as Aladdin, Linda Larkin as Jasmine and Gilbert Gottfried as Iago give also a praiseworthy performance. There is no weak performance in the movie and I see this clearly as I want to praise more characters. Like I said the humor works well, it is immersive and the characters feel like real people. This is a / the hallmark of great movies. I have also to talk about the fantastic soundtrack. It is one of the best Disney soundtracks, quite memorable and won Academy Awards. Overall this is a timeless classic I recommend for everyone. It shows the strengths of Disney movies of that time. Bonus knowledge: There is the fan theory that this movie is actually set in the far future after society collapsed in a catastrophic event because the Genie is familiar with our culture and had slept for a long time.",

The big one. The total shock. The constipation will shock the audience that will make them cry and **** out of their brains and make your eyes pop out like an over-the-top lunatic, what it's said to be the actor who died in August 2014. Now that IS a total shock. Period! And I think my friends from my old school know about that as well cause Robin voiced the Genie. He is a lovable characters like all Disney characters are.So that I got it out of the way let's get on with the main film. Aladdin. Now this is what I'm going to tell you about why me, Jacob and Liam liked it because again years ago we quoted all the dialogue from this movie just like from other Disney classics we quoted, this is an amazing, gripping and thrilling movie. The animation helps out the thrills of the excitement. There's a scene where Aladdin and Abu went to The Cave of Wonders to find the lamp but Abu accidentally touch the forbidden treasure called a gem so Aladdin, Abu and the magic carpet fly out of here before they'll die, that scene is just awesome! Friggin' fantastic! While Liam, Jacob and I quoting lines from the Disney classics me and Liam take turns and have fun doing it along with Jacob. Again like I said that Abu touched the gem that really makes me laugh. Why? Because Aladdin Shouts at Abu not to touch anything The Cave of Wonders knows that Abu touched something he said ''Infidels! You have touched the forbidden treasure! Now you will never again see the light of day!'' That is hilarious! And the CGI which I forgot to mention in the last review Beauty and the Beast is just unbelievable! It's unbelievably amazing! It feels like I'm on the roller coaster! In fact I think most people thought about this as well! It's just unbelievably f**king awesome! The scenes in this are just funny, memorable and hilarious! And the scene however where the Genie got out of the lamp. He's just got a lot of pop culture references in it! Ain't it amazing? Me, Jacob and Liam have been quoting this scene where Genie voiced by Robin Williams is singing a song called Friend Like Me and says to Aladdin something that is hilarious even Liam Fleming and I quoting that line, here is how: ''Excuse me? Are you looking at me? Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up? Did you bring me here? And all of a sudden you're walking out on me? I don't think so, not right now. You're getting your wishes, so sit down!'' There's also loads of dialogue that made people laugh. The songs are by Alan Menken again and the lyricist Tim Rice. They made the songs so catchy just like the songwriters did in the previous films and made the Disney Renaissance magical as they are. The songs called One Jump Ahead, Friend Like Me, Prince Ali and A Whole New World. There's a theme song to that as well sung by Regina Belle and again Peabo Bryson. Just like in Beauty and the Beast though this song is so beautiful and so charming like most Disney songs would do. The characters like I mention in full depth of the story almost. The princess called Jasmine is the princess who is tired of life in the royal palace and comes across a street rat named Aladdin and Aladdin in his prince costume Him and Jasmine know that they fell in live with each other. Actually she's the Disney Princess and by saying that like Snow White from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Cinderella from Cinderella, Princess Aurora from Sleeping Beauty, Ariel from The Little Mermaid and Belle from Beauty and the Beast, this is the Disney movie for boys. It stars a main character Aladdin. Well, how about that, Mr Doubting Mustafa? The evil villain of the movie is so powerful, so evil and so brilliant is Jafar. He is one of Disney's best villains of all time and he also get a funny line once in a while like the one when me and Liam said together is: ''I think it's time to say goodbye to Prince Abubu.'' Iago gets a funny line and he's Jafar sidekick besides he's voiced by Gilbert Gottfried and he has the funniest voice in comedy history. If you really wanna be thrilled and gripped by this amazing classic this is definitely the movie that will make you think you're on a roller coaster ride like all the other Disney Classics. The animation with CGI is definitely the highlight of animation.",

They are told that only one person is worthy to enter: \"the diamond in the rough\", whom Jafar later identifies as Aladdin, an Agrabah street urchin. Princess Jasmine of Agrabah, upset that the law requires her to marry a prince instead of one she loves, escapes the palace and meets Aladdin and his pet monkey, Abu. The palace guards capture Aladdin on Jafar's orders. Jasmine confronts Jafar to demand Aladdin's release, but he lies and says that Aladdin has been executed.Disguised as an old man, Jafar frees Aladdin and Abu and brings them to the cave, ordering them to retrieve the lamp. After being told to touch nothing but the lamp, Aladdin finds a magic carpet inside and obtains the lamp. Forgetting the cave's rule, Abu grabs a jewel. Aladdin, Abu, and the carpet rush to escape the cave as it collapses. Aladdin gives the lamp to Jafar, who throws both Aladdin and Abu back into the cave, though not before Abu steals the lamp back. Trapped, Aladdin rubs the lamp and meets the Genie who lives inside it. The Genie grants Aladdin three wishes. Aladdin tricks the Genie into freeing them all from the cave without using a wish. He uses his first wish to assume the identity of a prince to woo Jasmine, and promises to use his third wish to free the Genie from servitude.At Iago's suggestion, Jafar plots to become Sultan by marrying Jasmine. Aladdin, as \"Prince Ali Ababwa\", arrives in Agrabah with a large host, but Jasmine becomes angry when he discusses her fate with her father the Sultan and Jafar without her. As a means of apologizing, Aladdin takes Jasmine on a ride on the magic carpet. When she deduces his true identity, he convinces her that he only dresses as a peasant to escape the stresses of royal life. After Aladdin brings Jasmine home, the palace guards capture Aladdin on Jafar's behest and throw him into the sea. The Genie appears and saves him at the cost of his second wish. Aladdin returns to the palace and exposes Jafar's evil plot. Jafar flees after spotting the lamp and thus discovering Aladdin's true identity.Fearing that he will lose Jasmine if the truth is revealed, Aladdin breaks his promise and refuses to free the Genie. Iago steals the lamp, and Jafar becomes the Genie's new master. He uses his first two wishes to become Sultan and the world's most powerful sorcerer. He then exposes Aladdin's identity and exiles him, Abu, and the carpet to a frozen wasteland. They escape and return to the palace. Jasmine tries to help Aladdin steal the lamp back, but Jafar notices and overpowers the heroes with his magic. Aladdin taunts Jafar for being less powerful than the Genie, tricking Jafar into using his last wish to become an all-powerful genie himself. Now bound to his new lamp, Jafar ends up trapped inside it, taking Iago with him.With Agrabah returned to normal, the Genie banishes Jafar's lamp and advises Aladdin use his third wish to regain his royal title so the law will allow him to stay with Jasmine. Aladdin decides instead to keep his promise and frees the Genie. Realizing Aladdin and Jasmine's love, the Sultan changes the law to allow Jasmine to marry whom she chooses. The Genie leaves to explore the world, while Aladdin and Jasmine start their new life together.",
