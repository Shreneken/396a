  "summary": "This Academy Award-winning biography of American General George S. Patton chronicles the general's wartime activities and accomplishments, beginning with his entry into the North African campaign and ending with his removal from command after his outspoken criticism of US post-war military strategy.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The movie holds up far better than its detractors guessed - splendidly, in fact - not only thanks to Scott's spellbinding acting, but to the epic imagery, Coppola's (and Edmund North's) highly intelligent script and Schaffner's lucid, perfectly controlled direction.",
    "Patton remains to this day one of Hollywood's most compelling biographical war pictures.",
    "Patton is a war movie of unusual depth and a landmark in screen biographies.",
    "War is hell, and Patton is one hell of a war picture, perhaps one of the most remarkable of its type ever made.",
    "A giant Rorschach blot of a film, Patton can be read any number of ways, from a sly satire of gung-ho militarism to an epic glorification of Patton's old-school mentality.",
    "A huge, initially ambivalent but finally adoring, Pop portrait of one of the most brilliant and outrageous American military figures of the last one hundred years.",
    "Not a war film so much as the story of a personality who has found the right role to play. Scott's theatricality is electrifying.",
    "Scott is simply awesome as the one-of-a-kind General George Patton, the brilliant campaigner and man among men renowned for the rage he directed at the berks in authority and the adulation he inspired in his men.",
    "As a study of power, neither Coppola's script nor Schaffner's direction are precise enough to merit the praise that has been heaped upon them. As an exercise in biography, however, Schaffner and Coppola's character study of General George S Patton is marvellous, especially in its sideways debunking of the American Hero.",
    "It bends a few facts, and occasionally slips towards satire. But, for the most part, this is a remarkably enjoyable - and commendably fair - biopic of an unforgettable character. They don't make many films, or indeed generals, like this any more.",
    "Patton's personality--conveyed with pointed theatrical flair by George C. Scott--is registered in rich tones of grandeur and megalomania, genius and petty sadism.",
    "George C. Scott's Oscar-winning portrait of the megalomaniacal warrior general is still the glue holding together this blunt study of war as the ultimate human (and dehumanizing) game.",
    "The movie's vision blurs the man and, incidentally, the just war around him. Fortunately, the general is enacted by George C. Scott, who can sense a character in a gross script the way a sculptor can detect a man in a block of marble."

And man, oh, man was George S. Patton a flawed, strong, and idiosyncratic person. If anything, \"Patton\" illustrates the very peculiar nature of a man like the general in question. Seeing someone so obsessed with all of the antiquated benefits of war (i.e. glory, exhilaration, and fulfillment in the face of death) honestly does make for a complicated watch. You as an audience member really do end up both pitying and disliking Patton in equal measure. And though I can't necessarily justify the overall length, it still is an unquestionably fascinating experience at times.",

But in a war to decide who was going to rule the world, he was our \"go to\" guy.  I've seen a few documentaries about 1944; the mood of the people was turning anti-war; kind of like the Vietnam protests.

This is a lifeless, patriotic, American piece\rof propaganda. In a very, very negative way. It has no redeeming\rqualities, and every battle scene you get showed, you don't care about\rwho gets bombed and gets shot at by infantry, because everyone that\rgets killed in the battle scenes are faceless puppets, something an\remotionally driven war picture needs.\r The whole movie is about George S. Patton, an eccentric and\rcontroversial American war general with a short fuse, you might think\rthat will result in some fantastic scenes. No, not really. The whole\rmovie is really about how great Americans are, and how great this\rmaniacal war general is, showing manly decisions, epic battles (battles\rthat have no gravitas at all), how great he handles everything, etc,\retc. Each scene in 'Patton' could've easily been cut 2 to 4 minutes,\rresulting in a dragging and overlong movie with an unneeded runtime of\r172 minutes.\r All in all, i still gave 'Patton' a 1/10 because George C. Scott\rundeniably gives a powerhouse performance, and i respect Franklin J.\rSchaffner a lot, attempting to make a memorable war picture.",

The work that went behind writing just the protagonist clearly pays off, for it is the only thread that one wants to hold on to in this overstretched journey and boy what a thrilling ride it has to offer.It is rich on technical aspects like costume, production and art design, sound department, cinematography and editing. The camera work is stunning, it is shot beautifully with amazing locations and visuals that endorses the feature. The screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North, is electrifying and smart if not gripping and the only reason to that would be the overlong runtime that it ticks for which seems inessential at certain points. Franklin J. Schaffner; the director, is in his A game and has done an excellent work on executing the feature which could have easily been blunt and disenchanting and the key to that would be the sense of urgency that is created to bind it all. The performance objective is scored majestically by the protagonist George C. Scott and Karl Malden in his supporting role. Patton is a self-challenged and self-motivated feature whose protagonist justifies its title like never before.",

Scott delivers the performance of a lifetime, fully embracing the A movie that is guaranteed to grow less popular as the years pass and all things war become less acceptable - a positive notion for society, but an unfortunate one for film. Scott delivers the performance of a lifetime, fully embracing the geniune and outrageous character of General George S. Patton. Much like GANDHI, PATTON focuses very little of the childhood or development phases of its title character, instead thrusting us towards a truly memorable and perplexing human. This story is very thoughtful and driven by dialogue, without much in the way of baseness or bloody action; indeed there is more screentime devoted to the fatigue and damage done by war than to battle. Again like GANDHI, this film avoids criticizing its focal character, and tries to make its audience sympathize with whatever flaws or shortcomings it reveals about him. Really, the only difference between these two biopics (which are quite possibly the two best biographical films in the English language) is their main character's compulsion towards an end; Gandhi driven for peace, and Patton lusting for war. Do not expect PATTON to flinch; to its final scenes, it will not concede that the insensitivity and battle-pride of its main character are wrong. The best it will do is thankfully suggest that people such as Patton are a rare and increasingly unnecessary breed. The score is moving, the settings feel startlingly authentic (especially in contrast to contemporary film's green screen fetish), and the direction is unwaveringly thoughtful. This is a war movie for people who think, and thinking people need to see this movie.",

But the problem about the film is that when you make a really long film it has to be highly entertaining or you will just get bored and fall asleep.So that is what really backfired throughout this movie. That is why I did not like it as much as the critics. The only time I thought it was highly entertaining was in the last six minutes. In the first hour I would of gave it a five. Then in the next hour I would of gave it a six. Then finally in the last hour I decided to give this film a seven.",
