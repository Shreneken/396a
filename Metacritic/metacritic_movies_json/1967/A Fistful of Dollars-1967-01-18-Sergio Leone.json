  "critic_reviews": [
    "Leone makes the borders of the frame feel limitless, his camera moves striking out unpredictably as if he could barely tame his vision. Ennio Moriconne’s indelible score added a wild swagger to this oddball tale of a lone guman conniving plan to set two gangs of killers against one another.",
    "Based on Kurosawa's Yojimbo, it sets a fashion in surly, laconic, supercool heroes with Eastwood's amoral gunslinger, who plays off two gangs against one another in a deadly feud.",
    "Clearly, the magnet of this picture, which has been a phenomenal success in Italy and other parts of Europe, is this cool-cat bandit who is played by Clint Eastwood, an American cowboy actor who used to do the role of rowdy in the Rawhide series on TV. Wearing a Mexican poncho, gnawing a stub of cheroot and peering intently from under a slouch hat pulled low over his eyes, he is simply another fabrication of a personality, half cowboy and half gangster, going through the ritualistic postures and exercises of each.",
    "The plot is simple and the Italian performances verge on the operatic, but Leone revitalizes the Western through a unique and complex visual style. The film is full of brilliant spatial relationships (extreme close-ups in the foreground, with detailed compositions visible in the background) combined with Ennio Morricone's vastly creative musical score full of grunts, wails, groans, and bizarre-sounding instruments. Aural and visual elements together give a wholly original perspective on the West and its myths.",
    "The visual scheme of Leone’s movie leaves no doubt as to his familiarity with Kurosawa’s movie. Plopping Eastwood’s roving gunman down in the middle of a dusty street with opposing gangs lodged at either end, Fistful replicates Yojimbo’s visual plan to an almost distracting extent. The bigger problem with Fistful is that Leone is still attempting to work with a conventional plot, which never plays to his strengths.",
    "Actor Eastwood, the sometime star of television's Rawhide, is certainly not paid by the word. In Fistful he hardly talks at all. Doesn't shave, either. Just drawls orders. Sometimes the bad guys drawl back. Just as tersely. Trouble is, after they stop talking, their lips keep moving. That's because the picture is dubbed. Like the villains, it was shot in Spain. Pity it wasn't buried there."

That said, that is not down-grading A Fistful of Dollars in any way, it is still a truly great film. As with all Leone's it is incredibly well made, the scenery is epic and looks gorgeous and the extreme close ups really helps to enhance the unrelenting violence. Ennio Morricone's score is wonderful with its minimalist style really fitting with the movie. The story is both elegiac which helps to give that feel of mystery to the Man with No Name's character and thrilling with the violence and the camera work. Leone's direction is as ever superb, as is the acting. Clint Eastwood became an international superstar and you can see why, he oozes charisma and his idea to make The Man with No Name mysterious with minimal dialogue proved to be a great one. Of the supporting cast, Gian Maria Volonte is especially impressive, as Ramon he snarls very convincingly. All in all, a great film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

His motives are noble, albeit also very driven by money, he needs no further backstory. The effects are primitive, with bullets that don't penetrate and blood that looks like cranberry juice, yet I still absolutely love this movie, and there are two things which make me think that way. First and foremost, the music by Ennio Morricone. Without it, the movie would be incredibly bland and him and Sergio Leone, the director, make a perfect team. Second, Clint Eastwood in his prime is always absolutely cool to watch.This should be watched by everyone who wants to see a classic \"Italo-Western\".",

When a regiment of Mexican soldiers bearing gold intended to pay for new weapons is waylaid by the Rojo brothers, the stranger inserts himself into the middle of the long-simmering battle, selling false information to both sides for his own benefit. With Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo as his template, Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars helped define a new era for the Western and usher in its most iconic star, Clint Eastwood. I'll give A Fistful of Dollars an A. (9.6/10)",

As much as simple the plot goes, the weaving of the whole structure goes dull in its first act, as it grows obvious. It is rich on technical aspects like sound effects, background score and editing. Sergio Leone is no short on execution and has probably improved on his skills as it keeps the audience engaged and doesn't unnecessarily chews off the character's perspective. Clint Eastwood holds on to its role and delivers the expectations and doesn't require any support at all. There are few action packed sequences and whistle-blowing dialogues that can only come out of a fanboy's perspective and this is the key that makes the feature stand alone in its franchise. The choreography too has improved a lot and so has the meddling of the emotions among the characters that is done well within shorter runtime of almost 100 minutes that helps factor in on its favor. Firstful Of Dollars is more than a handful and even though its reach for something more colossal that its potential fails in here, it still grasps a whole lot of popcorn fun in here.",

But aside from it, the shootouts and gun fights are surprisingly boring, monotonous, and unvaried. One the other hand, the action and fight scenes that don't feature guns are so much fun, especially since Leone's style of camerawork and direction here are their best. I'm not exaggerating or anything; but A Fistful of Dollars really has some of the most inventive, and some of the coolest, camerawork and editing scenes I've seen in a Western film.I haven't seen Kurosawa's Yojimbo yet; but I really liked the story of this film. It's a story full of surprises, and twist and turns that kept me quite engaged and engrossed most of the time. While the movie has its slow parts, and the plot doesn't evolve very smoothly; it gets messy and muddled halfway through, A Fistful of Dollars's story never loses its track. The movie also feels somewhat heavy-handed at times, largely because the dialogue gets clumsy and overly expository at moments.I could have never imagined any actor who can be perfectly fit for this role as Clint Eastwood. He is as charismatic, bad-ass and tough as ever as the central character, Joe, and this was quite important, since this movie has this kind of story that focuses primarily on one protagonist (this is my favorite kind, btw).Overall, Per un pugno di dollari is yet another great Leone Western that makes me excited to keep exploring his small but very solid filmography.(8/10)",

And, there's much more to it other than being a trendsetter. ..Good : Holy s**t, am I supposed to say something good aboutSome films are not the greatest films in the genre. They are the f**king trendsetters. This movie is one of them. And, there's much more to it other than being a trendsetter. ..Good : Holy s**t, am I supposed to say something good about this film? There are no words to describe the greatness of a film that started it all. Let's speak in retrospect. Before this movie, the word \"Spaghetti Western\" wasn't even around. This movie gave us the word, and made it popular. There have been really great Westerns before this, and many cheesy and nosy ones. The greats are always the greats, but it took a lot of risk and did many things in contrast to the nosy and cheesy ones. It had a protagonist, who was characterized as someone similar to the bad guys. Obviously, he did things only against bad guys, but that's the only part of his characterization that separated him from them. Also, he was shown to be a mysterious, and somewhat vulnerable, person in contrast to the messiahs of typical American Westerns. Plus, it had some suspenseful and believable violence for delivering the usual \"triumph of good over evil\" in the end. And most importantly, all of these worked in this movie. It isn't an awkward Italian styled Western, it is very much relatable to the great older Westerns. Yet, it easily shines out as a uniquely distinct film. It popularized an entire subgenre of films, which is a very difficult task to do. Other than that, the movie made Clint Eastwood a star. Everyone is familiar with his level of stardom. He is arguably the biggest star of American film industry. It was all because of this movie. And Clint went on to make many great films, including Westerns, himself. This would've never been possible if he wasn't a star, which was due to this movie. It gave us a perfect combo of Ennio Morricone and Sergio Leone, which would improve over time. Speaking of the story, you can say that it's a typical story. But the beauty is in the way it was told - with suspense, music and violence. Eastwood's character feels like the same character that we see in the next two films of this trilogy. That gives a feel of continuity among these films, even though a very less of it is to be expected. He f**ks up bad guys, but never would he put his hands on the innocents. There are quite a few moments which prove that he is compassionate and clever. That is what has been shown in the other two films. ..Mixed : Reconsidering it on the present day, there have been many improvements over this. It's certainly not better than The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. I am a huge fan of Sergio Leone. I love his way of visual storytelling. He excelled in this aspect in his latter films. So, it feels a little weak compared to other of his films. It feels experimental in a few parts, as if Leone was trying to figure out what to do. ..Conclusion : A must watch for Western fans! It may not be as great as other iconic Westerns, but in retrospect, it's one of the greatest films ever made. Eastwood is a badass and full of testosterone. The \"three coffins ready\" scene is, in my opinion, the best \"testosterone scene\" he has ever been in. ..Rating. ..Score : absolute 10/10Grade : golden A+",

O figurino está de parabéns, principalmente pela roupa do protagonista, que é quase um contraste do que há ao seu redor. Com tudo isso dito, devo dizer que o que mais me chamou atenção na obra foi sua trilha sonora. Sinto muita falta da criatividade no que se diz respeito a OST nos filmes. Antes essa ideia era muito utilizada, e aqui ela funciona de maneira magnifica. A ost que toca em diversos momentos do filme aumenta a tensão, define o gênero e fica na nossa memoria por até mesmo décadas - dependendo de quão marcante for.",

Easwtood does, of course, play the very sly and laidback man with no name, although his character is referred to briefly as 'Joe'. Some scenes are rather slow paced and thus may put off some but the confrontation/fight scenes are, obviously, the opposite - there's a real frenetic energy which energised me while watching.I liked that it has a more budget feel to it - that its clearly not a Hollywood film, featuring characters of different ethnicities/nationalities, the visually grainier feel to the shots and so on. Also the very bright red blood used didn't seem esp. realistic but I suppose there is a certain charm to that somehow.I can understand the appeal of this film, its one of those whereby characters can say more in their moments of silence, via their facial expressions than by dialogue, so suffice to say I'd certainly recommend this film to fans of Westerns, more specifically Spaghetti Westerns (if you haven't seen it already).",
