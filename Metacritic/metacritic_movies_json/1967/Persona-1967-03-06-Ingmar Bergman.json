  "critic_reviews": [
    "Persona is a film we return to over the years, for the beauty of its images and because we hope to understand its mysteries.",
    "One of the screen's supreme works and perhaps Ingmar Bergman's finest film, \"Persona\" is also his most radical in form and technique.",
    "Persona is a film to make you shiver with fascination, or incomprehension, or desire.",
    "Wonderfully complex but warmly human, Bergman's drama is one of his very best.",
    "This is Ingmar Bergman's chaste exploration of psychosis. It's not a horror story but a poem, and remarkable for that. This is one of the director's masterworks.",
    "It explores two of the filmmaker’s pet themes – the impossibility of true communication, the futility of art – and is set against the Vietnam War. Extraordinary.",
    "Persona doesn’t really benefit from too much thought. It’s a visceral experience that’s best felt, accepted, and left alone to rattle around in your subconscious for years to come. Rest assured that it will.",
    "Not an easy film, but an infinitely rewarding one.",
    "Persona feels like an act of disclosure on Bergman’s part, with him pulling back the curtain to acknowledge the fantasy of filmmaking and global realities that linger in his mind.",
    "Despite its elaborate meta-game-playing, which has had a pronounced and unquantifiable influence on film culture, Persona remains intensely alive and intimate.",
    "Arguably the most rewarding aspect of Persona is its rewatchability. The movie’s themes are so complex and deeply buried that it offers something new each time it is seen. Like a Rorschach test, one’s interpretation says more about the person offering the opinion than the film itself.",
    "Persona still conveys a power to lift the scalp and scramble the brain, and the fact that it's out-of-time says less about it being dated than it does about it remaining a radically visionary work.",
    "Bergman blends a theatrical subjectivity—scenes of the inner life that defy physical reality and depend on special effects, whether in the film lab or on set—with a tactile visual intimacy, with his characters, the objects close at hand, and the superb coastal landscape.",
    "Persona is at once tactile and elusive, splintered and seamless, systematic and free-associative. Essentially a movie of fragments and vignettes, it is held together by the power of the artist’s craft and the centripetal force of his unconscious.",
    "Bergman has come up with probably one of his most masterful films technically and in conception, but also one of his most difficult ones.",
    "Persona (the ancient Latin word for mask) is too deliberately difficult to rank with Bergman's best. But in an era when the director who dares to repeat himself is rare indeed—when the cinematic world is full of one-shot wonders, Bergman's consistency is itself refreshing.",
    "Ingmar Bergman's best film, I suppose, though it's still fairly tedious and overloaded with avant-garde cliches."

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nconsider myself to be a film scholar and my favourite film is “Persona” which was released in 1966. “Persona” is a Swedish psychological drama film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman and starring Bibi Andersson and liv Ullman. This film both fascinates and hypnotizes and leaves the viewer with a lot of questions and a lust to watch it again and again. This is not a film, but a real masterpiece.Bergman called “Persona” the most important film of his career. It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma which swallows you completely, with its symbolism in the first shot telling a story in pictures, using the language of associations.A boy is abandoned by his mother and his mother suffers from her inability to love him. It is pure theatre, where all the action is set in just two locations - a hospital and a house on the coast.The director examines the personality of the actor in which lies and truth are indistinguishable. Every gesture is false and every smile is a grimace. It is filmed as a monologue with the plot built around two women - one of them is a famous actress patient and other is a nurse taking care of the first: The famous stage actress, Elisabet Volgler who has suddenly stopped speaking and is able to pronounce only two phrases in the entire film and; Alma her nurse, who is in a dialogue with herself.A static camera. Two characters interacting actively through tantrums. Conflicts and physical contact. Andersson and Ullmann´s acting is impeccable, the camera work superb. Everything has meaning and significance. There is no empty dialogue and no special effects. Raw.For me, this is a film about the fear of being oneself and the necessity to comply with social conventions. Everybody plays a role, adopting masks and eventually thereby loses their inner selves. Pain, fear, despair and lies occupy human life and the inability to stop, fall silent, live and realize each simple step taken and to allow oneself to be seen by others, is what make us people.I would highly recommend “Persona”, especially if you are keen on classic cinema.",

I watched already another Bergman movie and this one is as boring as The Seventh Seal: extremely serious, weird / artificial behaviours and weird dialogues. Persona is slightly better, because it is easier to understand, what it is about, but I dont care. So an actress is starting to be mute and get a nurse to take care of her. I dont care why she gets mute, what she thinks, what she feels.",
