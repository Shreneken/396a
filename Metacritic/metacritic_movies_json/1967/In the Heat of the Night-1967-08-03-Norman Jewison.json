  "critic_reviews": [
    "Yes, it’s a thriller with a murder mystery at the heart of it. But “whodunnit” is immaterial to the film’s thrills, and the one thing I seem to forget every time I watch it anew.",
    "It’s a pleasure, all too rare, to watch two splendid actors pitted against each other with equal force such as Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger in the exceptional murder mystery, In the Heat of the Night. Over the years I remember a few extraordinary cases of this kind - Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable in “San Francisco.” Alec Guinness and Jack Hawkins in “The Prisoner,” Richard Burton and Peter O’Toole in “Becket.”",
    "But here Norman Jewison has taken a hard, outspoken script, prepared by Stirling Silliphant from an undistinguished novel by John Ball, and, with stinging performances contributed by Rod Steiger as the chief of police and Sidney Poitier as the detective, he has turned it into a film that has the look and sound of actuality and the pounding pulse of truth.",
    "Steiger got the best actor Oscar for his masterful, Method deep-dive portrayal of Gillespie, a man just smart enough to know he's neither as talented as Tibbs nor as ignorant as the people around him. His jaw always working a wad of gum, his beady eyes darting, his blood pressure stroke-level as he spits out orders, he manages to play big without ever splitting the seams of his character.",
    "No deep solutions are suggested in this subtle and meticulously observed study. Yet Director Norman Jewison has used his camera to extract a certain rough-cut beauty from each protagonist. He has shown, furthermore, that men can join hands out of fear and hatred and shape from base emotions something identifiable as a kind of love. In this he is immeasurably helped by performances from Steiger and Poitier that break brilliantly with black-white stereotype.",
    "Though the film portrays the racism of the South as institutional and inescapable, it’s a little too eager to offer glimmers of hope with increasing frequency as the film nears its end and Tibbs and Gillespie come to understand each other better.",
    "The sheer tactlessness of its racial confrontation has a forthright quality and a not entirely intentional documentary realism, especially in the scenes shot on location in Sparta, Illinois (standing in for a fictional Mississippi town).",
    "An excellent Sidney Poitier performance, and an outstanding one by Rod Steiger, overcome some noteworthy flaws to make In The Heat of the Night an absorbing contemporary murder drama, set in the deep, red-necked South.",
    "A gripping and suspenseful murder mystery that effects a feeling of greater importance by its veneer of social significance and the illusion of depth in its use of racial color.",
    "The twist-filled storyline, which digs up nasty secrets all over the show and offers a satisfying range of suspicious suspects and a truly disgusting killer, remains gripping, and the excellent, understated lead performances don't harp on the racial angle in that embarassing fashion which makes so many Socialy Significant films instantly dated.",
    "This is a brisk, well-oiled thriller with blistering performances and a crackling, memorable script.",
    "Superb thriller...IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT was carefully directed by Norman Jewison, who avoids sentimentality and all the racial cliches that could have crept into almost every scene.",
    "A decent piece of do-good cinema...Director Norman Jewison stages their confrontations for effectively flashy, immediate effects, though he unnecessarily neglects the action-movie underpinning."

The scrutiny in here is thought out with each individual character's perspective that makes not only its characters three dimensional but also a more mature and stronger plot that isn't here to merely deliver a nail-biting thriller drama but an all direction view of the black and white aspects of the truth. It may be short on technical aspects like background score, production and art design, but is utterly adequate on editing and cinematography. The adaptive screenplay by Sterling Silliphant is witty, strong, gripping and aware of the characteristics of the characters well enough to keep the audience engaged throughout the course of it and offer them thought-provoking homework, too along with that. Norman Jewison; the director, is in his A game as his pitch on the emotions and the stakes creates the anticipated impact and draws out the best outcomes from the screen. Sidney Poitier is convincing as a protagonist but the real game changer in here is Rod Steiger in his parallel role steals the show with his stellar performance. In The Heat Of Night is a shattering and revealing showdown iterated in a night whose discectomy is just pleasingly ingenious to encounter",

It does well at highlighting the prejudice African Americans faced, regardless of their professional occupations or not. Its a sobering watch in parts - the way the local police chief laughs off some of what the African American (Virgil Tibbs) says, ignoring his clearly decent background makes for depressing viewing certainly.However, there is also prejudice shown towards others in this film, mainly that of womenn. I'd say it does well at highlighting such social issues and is a relatively engrossing watch. I would recommend this film, yes.",

Norman Jewison's marvelous direction and camera work show a beautiful, ugly urban landscape in the American South where an unpredictable mystery plot is taking place; spearheaded by a one-two knockout punch from both Sydney Poitier and Rod Steiger. Poitier in particular, has a way of using body language more so than words. The result is a performance that transcends off the camera, off the screen, and onto your living room floor (or wherever you're watching the film). He is that good. Steiger works as a great contrast to the sophisticated Poitier by making us believe he's a rough caloot who is initially prejudice, but can learn to appreciate others when given the chance/exposure.",
