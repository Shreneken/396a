    "critic_reviews": [
        "For better or worse, American cinema changed forever the day Bonnie And Clyde was released. Almost every aspect of it was revolutionary.",
        "Gene Hackman, as the older brother who literally takes the back seat to Beatty, is just about perfect, while Estelle [Parsons] creates a richly detailed characterization as his petty wife, a preacher\u2019s daughter.",
        "Bonnie and Clyde is the most excitingly American American movie since \u201cThe Manchurian Candidate.\u201d The audience is alive to it. Our experience as we watch it has some connection with the way we reacted to movies in childhood: with how we came to love them and to feel they were ours\u2014not an art that we learned over the years to appreciate but simply and immediately ours.",
        "With its weird landscape of dusty, derelict towns and verdant highways, stunningly shot by Burnett Guffey in muted tones of green and gold, it has the true quality of folk legend.",
        "So definitive in so many ways, Bonnie and Clyde has become a 20th-century touchstone.",
        "Bonnie and Clyde is a milestone in the history of American movies, a work of truth and brilliance. It is also pitilessly cruel, filled with sympathy, nauseating, funny, heartbreaking, and astonishingly beautiful.",
        "There is something special about the production, with its brash, vivid style, indelible performances by movie icons, and bold mixture of violence and comedy, romance and tragedy.",
        "The playful performances haven't aged, and it still finds all the carefree thrills of being young, dumb, in love with life, and ready for death.",
        "If the movie is better than anything Hollywood has done for a good while, it is still a compromise that barely misses being a self-destruction. Its failures, however, aren't due to any infidelity to history or to the American underlife, but to an incomplete loyalty to its own arresting propositions.",
        "Bonnie and Clyde could look like a celebration of gangster glamour only to a man with a head full of wood shavings. These two visibly have the life expectancy of dragonflies; their sense of power and of unending gang fun is a delusion, and to see them duping themselves is as harrowing as the spectacle of most other hoaxes.",
        "It's by far the least controlled of Penn's films, but the pieces work wonderfully well, propelled by what was then a very original acting style.",
        "Landmark gangster film that made a huge commercial and cultural splash.",
        "Though Bonnie And Clyde may have been conceived as a proto-European hybrid and The Graduate a California thoroughbred, the violent hemorrhage that closes the Depression-era/Vietnam-era touchstone makes as good a case as anything in filmed entertainment that American mass media operates in the declarative.",
        "This inconsistency of direction is the most obvious fault of Bonnie and Clyde, which has some good ingredients, although they are not meshed together well.",
        "Penn's film oozes an intellectual's fashionable contempt for the characters.",
        "It is a cheap piece of bald-faced slapstick comedy that treats the hideous depredations of that sleazy, moronic pair as though they were as full of fun and frolic as the jazz-age cutups in \"Thoroughly Modern Millie.\"",
        "Director Arthur Penn have elected to tell their tale of bullets and blood in a strange and purposeless mingling of fact and claptrap that teeters uneasily on the brink of burlesque. Like Bonnie and Clyde themselves, the film rides off'in all directions and ends up full of holes...The real fault with Bonnie and Clyde is its sheer, tasteless aimlessness."

No longer would sexuality be left to flirtatious hints in the dialogue and no longer would the violence be safe. Instead, Bonnie and Clyde ushered in New Hollywood, an auteur driven era that found American directors reveling in the lifting of the Hays code and lifting all censors from their work. However, American audiences still had to shed their own conceptions as to what can and cannot be allowed in a work of art and it was Bonnie and Clyde that started to make critics and audiences alike realize the potential of this new era. Opening up with Faye Dunaway nude with her back to the camera, it was clear that cinema was about to become far friskier. Rushing to the window without clothes on after hearing the mysterious Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) poking around with her mother's car, Dunaway's Bonnie Parker soon takes up with Clyde with Dunaway turning the iconic crime spree girl into a real sexpot. From trying to help Clyde with his impotence to stroking his gun and looking seductively into his eyes, Bonnie Parker practically single-handedly lifts America into this new era with her sultry disposition and raw sexuality.Criticized for celebrating these two murderers, the film actually does anything but when you really look at it all. Bonnie and Clyde are the protagonists, yes, but the film shows their insanity, their hubris, their stupidity, and their greed. Always confident they will never be caught, they take chances and mock those that chase them. They take photos with the police and meet up with random people from whom they had stolen a car. These are two dumb kids who, while maybe not wholly evil, are malevolently moronic. Any average criminal would get caught, but the duo were the benefits of their free wheeling attitude and willingness to drive across the whole of America in committing their crimes. Turning them into myths, the two would show up randomly into a town and rob a bank while the newspaper would attribute them with three times as many robberies in places they had never been. They were ghosts and the go-to for any news story. Had they not driven all over and the media not started printing falsehoods, it is entirely possible they would have been able to be tracked by the police. Instead, it was a wild goose chase until they were able to turn CW Moss (Michael J. Pollard) against the couple.Unafraid to show the graphic results of the couple's violence, we see them kill innocents and kill cops right up close. We see them take on the cops and, yet, we root for them. Through all of their stupidity and murderous intent, the couple are classic cinematic antiheroes who make you root for them out of respect for their pure brazenness and utter lack of inhibition. The film's portrayal of violence, however, breaks through this a bit. From when they kill innocents to when they are finally executed in a hail of bullets, we see what this life of crime brings: violence and a lot of it. Director Arthur Penn uses this violence, alongside the sexuality, to usher in that new era of Hollywood, but to also jar the audience. The violence is unexpected from a film released in 1967. For it to be so bloody and so graphic, audiences at the time had to be running for the hills. I mean, we see a guy get shot five inches from the camera. We see a woman lose her eye. This is a brutal, brutal film. Penn does this shocking level of violence to underscore that Bonnie and Clyde are not to be revered. Their hands are covered in blood and their hubris has caused many good people to die and leave their families behind. While the papers and their legacy has romanticized their status to an insane degree, the gritty details are simple: they are murderers. Bonnie and Clyde is a film that is unafraid to confront this reality, no matter how much it may shock.A boundary smashing film, Arthur Penn's rendition of the classic crime couple Bonnie and Clyde finds Penn introducing overt sexuality, sensuality, and violence to American films in telling this classic story. Not romanticizing it in the least, Penn offers up gruesome recountings of the couple's crime spree across America and shows their immaturity and pride, which ultimately led to their demise in a hail of bullets. Finding Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway doing some of their best work as the classic couple alongside a charismatic and scenery chewing Gene Hackman, Bonnie and Clyde ushered in a new era in film while decisively closing the book on the more romantic beliefs some had regarding Bonnie and Clyde. There is no romance in violence, underscored by Clyde's impotence and the film's refusal to show them as anything but remorseless idiots that stole from others simply because they could, while being unafraid to shoot their way out of a tight spot.",

I didn't see Bonnie and Clyde until quite recently, and I can completely understand the film's reputation as it is a fantastic film. It is very well made, with crisp cinematography and a superb period recreation. The violence here is not cartoony, it is very violent and shocking, as seen in the ending which I also found quite affecting. Arthur Penn directs beautifully, there is a compelling story, a slick pace and a cracking script with some of the most important and sharpest dialogue in any film of the '60s. I was amazed by the last scene with Bonnie and her mother, it was a scene that is very chilling but also one that resonates emotionally too. And the acting I have no qualms with. Gene Hackman is wonderful as is Estelle Parsons as a somewhat annoying character. Also Gene Wilder makes a brief but funny appearance. But the film belongs to Warren Beatty and Faye Dunnaway, who actually become the characters rather than just playing them. Overall, a fantastic film and one of the best and most important of its decade. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The characters are portrayed very well and the cast in this is beautifully well done not to mention Gene Wilder is in this. He's in the film for the short time. I absolutely really love the cinematography in this. It is really fantastically shot. This is something that you will see in the cinema. It really is beautifully made and the acting from Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway is so mesmerizing. And the ending of course is so amazing. Years ago people said it became one of the bloodiest death scenes in cinematic history. Britian's say these two are a bunch of idiots because they rob banks as the tagline says \"We rob banks.\" As 60's cinema goes, this is an impeccable film with great directing and everything that defines the 60's in filmmaking. Bonnie and Clyde is a fantastic film and my new favourite film of all time.",

It's one of those must-see films for film students, movie buffs or specialized critics. However, it is a film largely forgotten by the general public, and is rarely shown on TV, even on specialty channels.Directed by Arthur Penn, the film addresses the criminal trajectory of Bonnie Elizabeth Parker, a young married woman, and her lover Clyde Chestnut Barrow. In real life, they had a short existence, in the mid-30s, but they roamed a good portion of the Midwest, where they robbed banks, convenience stores, gas stations, etc., totaling more than a hundred robberies and were about twenty people were killed (as the film shows, they avoided gratuitous violence and preferred to avoid confrontations and shootings). The film wastes no time and, in the first few minutes, reveals to us the sudden, even improbable, way in which they both meet and fall in love.However, one of the problems with the film is that it actually continues to create myths around the bad guys, just as the press at the time did. They're charming, they're charismatic, they're almost heroes, and there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with robbing banks in this movie. To make everything even more dubious, the production chose for the protagonists two beautiful actors, who are nothing like the real thugs. Indeed, the film tells a pleasant story, yet it is not historically rigorous, nor does it accurately report what they did.The cast is led by two good actors: the beautiful and blonde Faye Dunaway is very good, charismatic and elegant, and makes in this film one of the works that immortalized her as an actress, and the same can be said of Warren Beatty, who gave life to Clyde, with commitment, professionalism, energy and passion. In fact, the work of the two actors is impeccable, and the way they work together, the intense chemistry that emanates from them when they're together, is something powerful. Do they give us an idealized view of the bad guys? Yes\u2026 but they are extremely competent for the task and are doing what they are asked to do. The film also features Michael Pollard, Gene Hackman and Denver Pyle, all of whom are high quality additions, who put a lot of effort into their characters. For me, only Estelle Parsons spoils the scene with her irritating, histrionic character, always screaming, or crying like a repentant Magdalene. I honestly can't understand how the hell she won the Oscar with this movie!Technically, it is a film with several interesting aspects to consider, starting right away with an excellent cinematography, full of realism, without excessive embellishments and exaggerated artifices. The sets are good, they are within what I expected to find; I loved the cars used in the film, and the way the film takes advantage of them. In the same way I also liked the landscapes, which show us an arid and desolate view of the American Midwest, devastated not only by the difficulties of the Great Depression but also by a severe drought, the \u201cDust Bowl\u201d. The visuals, specials and sound effects work very well, particularly in the action scenes, and that scene where the shootings destroyed the bandits' car is truly anthological. The only thing I didn't like, although I understand and think it fits well with the film, the way it was thought out and executed, is the soundtrack, with all those banjo solos.",
