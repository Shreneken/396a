  "critic_reviews": [
    "The excellence of Katherine Ross as Mrs Robinson’s daughter, Elaine, is often overlooked. A hugely pleasurable film.",
    "A brutally funny look at contemporary youth, encrusted with status symbols and guilt for gilt rejecting the weights of privilege to rail against the tides of society they would rather reject than succumb to, rather question than attend to. Both tuned and attuned to its subject and on target for most of its course, this second film from director Nichols will benefit from enthusiastic word of mouth, winning a large audience and corresponding profits from both sides of the 30 year demarcation line.",
    "It takes about three minutes – roughly the length of time it takes Hoffman to get down the moving walkway to Simon and Garfunkel's Sound of Silence and from the airport to the suffocating atmosphere of his graduation party, where he gets gradually trapped into a relationship with one of his parents' friends – to realise that The Graduate is actually a very nasty film, and a very, very funny one.",
    "Director Mike Nichols exploits rather than interrogates Ben’s anxieties, so that his ennui is reducible to his accomplishments, which keep getting repeated by the adults as badges of vicarious honor. Nichols also plays Ben’s socially awkward tics for laughs, whether Ben’s literally whimpering in Mrs. Robinson’s presence or in a cold sweat as he arranges what appears to be his first sexual encounter.",
    "Cruel comedy with a delicious light touch.",
    "All the talents involved in The Graduate make it soar brightly above its shortcomings and, for reasons given, make it a milestone in American film history. Milestones do not guarantee that everything after them will be better, still they are ineradicable.",
    "The funniest American comedy of the year.",
    "Dustin Hoffman gives the inspired performance that launched his movie career, and director Mike Nichols shows a gift for social satire that has never glistened quite so brightly since. [Review of re-release]",
    "The Graduate is a flawlessly acted and produced film. [Review of re-release]",
    "Funny, outrageous, and touching, The Graduate is a sophisticated film that puts Mr. Nichols and his associates on a level with any of the best satirists working abroad today.",
    "The Graduate is a delightful, satirical comedy-drama about a young man's seduction by an older woman, and the measure of maturity which he attains from the experience.",
    "Hoffman and Bancroft are phenomenally cast in a script co-written by Buck Henry and Calder Willingham that is by turns sly, touching, and amazingly fresh 30 years later. [Review of re-release]",
    "The Graduate, the erratic, jet-age film at the Coronet and Lincoln Art, has two standout performances - one from a young actor, who looks as if the worries of the world rested on his sawed-off body, and another from a director, still new to movies, whose spit and polish technique at times borders on genius.",
    "The light ribbing of conspicuous consumption in southern California and the Simon and Garfunkel songs on the sound track both play considerable roles in giving this depthless comedy some bounce. [Review of re-release]",
    "Although the first half still works – largely due to the performance of Anne Bancroft as the iconic Mrs. Robinson – the second half is a mess with only a couple of funny lines to recommend it.",
    "Looked at now (2017), The Graduate is frankly a film you admire more than actually enjoy experiencing. Dark, pitiless and despairing, it plays stranger and more distant to me today than it did back in the day. So much so that one wonders if that was the plan from the beginning, when the fact that its mildly transgressive attitude seemed fresh and new disguised its essential nature.",
    "What was once an all-important signpost to adulthood is really little more than a simple romantic comedy whose \"countercultural\" message, insofar as it has one, is decidedly retrograde. [Review of re-release]",
    "The screenplay, which begins as genuine comedy, soon degenerates into spurious melodrama."

People refer to it as a great comedy, but I beg to differ. Why I find the Graduate to be such a perfect film is because of the dramatic element behind it.\rThe two protagonists, Benjamin and Elaine, spend the entire film slowly building the willpower to rebel against control their control freak parents, and after an exhilarating finale, finally get away, with all responsibility thrown out the window. But it's the film's lingering ending, where the smiles fade, and the music cues up, that set it apart. It isn't just a film about rebellion, it is THE youth movie. It contains all the pain and pleasure of being a teenager, and goes far deeper than the conflict on the surface, providing an intense moral struggle that even the characters are rarely aware of. Everything in this film comes together in just the right way to make the message immaculate, and I think it's the type of film everyone should watch to gain a greater understanding of teenage life, regardless of your age.",

The film tells a story of a young graduate student (who knew) who finds himself tangled up in an affair with his father's business partner's wife. Now, first off, I've heard nothing but great things about this movie. I heard that Hoffman was great in it, it had a great story, soundtrack, dialogue, etc. I can say that after everything I heard, this film definitely lived up to it's hype. The film is almost half a century old and yet I found myself (a generation Z college student) relating to it in a myriad of incredible ways. The fact that this film stands strong after an immense amount of time is, in my honest opinion, the most impressive aspect of the film. Dustin Hoffman is arguably the greatest actor in the business and he's in this movie - it's common knowledge that he's going to be good in it. All of the characters in this film were well written and well portrayed as well. Even the side characters were well-written. The script, in general, seems to be the epitome of good writing. The soundtrack is written by two of my most favorite artists - Simon And Garfunkel. Needless to say, it's timeless and unforgettable. The ending of the film was really well done, and the direction altogether seemed to be executed with the utmost precision. There were even a few editing techniques that impressed me in this film. Overall, \"The Graduate\" is a film that truly impressed me. Every person that was at once a student (pretty much everybody) should see and identify with this film. Really good stuff here.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nIn following up those cinematic classics that I’m somehow still catching up on, I recently saw The Graduate for the first time. I inevitably went into it with some idea of what was going to happen, but little more than an expectation for Dustin Hoffman to pursue a relationship with an older woman, to the sound of Simon & Garfunkel.\r Hoffman is Benjamin Braddock, the disaffected young university graduate who returns from his studies to a summer without direction. He is swiftly seduced by Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father’s business partner, and embarks on a lengthy affair, but his affection soon turns to her daughter, Elaine. Yet this is merely the bare bones of the plot: it’s more complex than a simple romantic comedy, and the ending, notably, is ambiguous.\r It’s impossible to complain about spoilers for a film that came out over forty years ago; it has seeped into popular culture, and been subjected to merciless parody. The iconic ending sequence is especially strange to watch for someone who grew up repeatedly watching Wayne’s World 2 (1993), where it is replicated shot for shot.\r The critical eye has been on the film for so long, and it has passed through so many generations that its contemporary relevance can be questioned. Though a product of the late 1960s, the counterculture elements we associate with the period, such as free love, psychedelia, or hard rock. Benjamin’s sexual experiences are not part of a revolution, and he remains trapped firmly within the rigid framework of upper middle class suburbia.\r While there’s a certain fascination to looking back on a snapshot of the past, many of us no longer have the same relationship with our parents and the older generation. Do we look back at a history of steady liberalisation, but no massive social upheaval, and see further subversion as unnecessary? Do our parents, the children of the past, simply provide us with a system we no longer need to escape? Maybe modern youth have it worse than Benjamin; our coming of age is not so straightforward. We are no longer afforded the opportunity of clear rebellion, and are left to wallow in the established structure.\r What does hold true is the portrayal of a graduate with no clear future, returning to inhabit the fading skeleton of a life that’s somehow no longer his own, and the dull resignation that there’s little incentive to do anything about it. As a graduate myself (Though my current social circle suffers an absence of attractive lonely women) I can largely sympathise with Benjamin’s predicament.\r It seems coming of age requires something extreme, ditching the world and obligations, the way that Benjamin does at the end of The Graduate. The whole film is an exploration of these questions, symbolically relayed through the central relationships. The choices the characters make in their attachments are reflective of the choices that can be made in all facets of life.\r This is emphasised stylistically through a number of visually captivating shots and transitions that underline the sense of emptiness and alienation. Water (swimming pools, aquariums, and rain) appears frequently as a tool of separation. The soundtrack contains little youthful euphoria, but is melancholic, featuring repeated motifs that again, accentuate loneliness.\r These are played during moments that could otherwise be seen as positive steps in Benjamin’s life, at the height of his relationship with Mrs. Robinson, and during his final elopement, elevating the drama above mere comedy.\r His obsession with Elaine is far from romantic destiny, and exists primarily as an escape from his relationship with her mother, and a chance to give his life some purpose outside an unhealthy liaison that makes him feel increasingly trapped. Compared with Mrs. Robinson, Elaine’s character is chronically underdeveloped, though she responds positively to Benjamin’s pseudo-philosophical ramblings.\r While she is disgusted to learn of Benjamin’s affair with her mother, we learn little else of her thoughts on home, and where she fits in do the loveless dynamic in the Robinson household. We do not know if she as desperate to break free as Benjamin is. She ultimately follows him on impulse, having initially been happy to marry another at her parents’ request.\r The separation from the character of Elaine forces us to experience the relationship purely from the perspective of Benjamin, who has put her on a pedestal and made her the object of his salvation.\r Despite the vein of sympathy I have as a fellow graduate, Benjamin is at times an insufferable and frustrating character to watch, and ultimately, Mrs. Robinson comes off as more sympathetic. She is the one who is truly lost and trapped. Benjamin still has his whole life ahead of him, once he finally decides what he’s going to do with it.",

Anne Bancroft, Katharine Ross and relative newcomer Dustin Hoffman head a very competent cast.\r An excellent screenplay by Calder Willingham and comedy specialist Buck Henry, based on the Charles Webb novel, focuses on Hoffman, just out of college and wondering what it’s all about. Predatory Miss Bancroft, wife of Murray Hamilton, introduces Hoffman to mechanical sex, reaction to which evolves into true love with Miss Ross, Miss Bancroft’s daughter.\r Had the story been told in terms of straight drama, it would have been one of those boring modern mellers — the hippie equivalent of a woman’s pic — in which vacant stares are supposed to convey emotion and plot action, and jazzed up cinematics become obvious and pretentious. To be sure, Nichols, in his second feature film, has laid on, with a trowel, most of the current gimmicks, but, thanks to a strong script, they are not noticeable for most of the film.\r In the 70 minutes which elapse from Hoffman’s arrival home from school to the realization by Miss Ross that he has had an affair with her mother, pic is loaded with hilarious comedy and, because of this, the intended commentary on materialistic society is most effective. Only in retrospect does one realize a basic, but not overly damaging, flaw: Hoffman’s achievements in school are not credible in light of his basic shyness. No matter, or not much, anyway.\r Miss Bancroft, feline and slinky in a manner very much like Lauren Bacall, is excellent, as is Miss Ross, an exciting, fresh actress from the Universal stable, who has a long career ahead of her. Hoffman is perfect in his role. William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson play his parents in top fashion. Small, but well-cast, supporting contingent includes co-scripter Henry, as a room clerk.\r Only in the final 35 minutes, as Hoffman drives up and down the LA-Frisco route in pursuit of Miss Ross, does film falter in pacing, result of which the switched-on cinematics become obvious, and therefore tiring. Vet cameraman Robert Surtees used Panavision and Technicolor to desired advantage. It would be wrong to say that Surtees has “turned on” to new techniques; more precisely, and more importantly, he is responsive to the desire for a modern look. In other words, he is a professional craftsman.\r Richard Sylbert’s production design is outstanding, again. Paul Simon wrote the good songs, sung by Simon & Garfunkel, and Dave Grusin’s incidental music is equally adroit. Sam O’Steen’s editing is sharp, and other technical credits are strong. Count this one a winner for Joseph E. Levine, Turman and Nichols Murf.",

Yet, even after all this praise, the movie still out-punches its weight class, which is why the film is timely every spring and timeless overall.",

As much as general and diverse the message grows socially,Attraction Or Repulsion.The GraduateNichols's compelling drama of a rift between sexuality and morality is a forward pass on terms of the genre the cinema can and ought to offer. As much as general and diverse the message grows socially, the real raunchy methods up-taken by the writers is bold and vivid enough to leave a long lasting impression. Sweeping of all the perspective, opinions, schemes and what not sort of drama, within around 100 minutes, the anticipated intentions are circled up with an adequate storytelling. If its first act seems humorous and light enough to nail any sort of intensity on the board, the second act adds plethora of spice to the tale with jealousy, politics and selfishness that shows the three dimensional side of these perfectly cooked characters.And with a jarring last act that gives you goosebumps for its potential to shift the entire tone into an electrifying love story that corners our protagonist to succeed against all odds, the finesse is to aspire from. The nail biting climatic act offers this ethically complex situation a cathartic release which no matter how much crowd pleasing it may seem, is also wisely crafted to be mature. Hoffman as the obedient student and of like-able persona has a completely different identity hidden behind him.Frankly this is not a pleasant figure and Nichols makes sure he never tries to justify it which would be uncalled for. But justice is to be served, and serving it with an intention to draw out a cinematic arc for the character, there resides a quote that cannot define it all more than enough, \"I'll give you 20 dollars for a dime.\" says Hoffman in his lowest pit. Bancroft and Ross, possibly the combination of the most bizarre triangle love story are holding onto their parts dearly. The Graduate not only qualifies but is undoubtedly a top contender.",

It makes very little sense.Mrs. Robinson accuse him of rape, and her daughter Elaine is happy to walk into his bedroom and shut the door behind her, and is convinced it's not rape after he says one sentence. Her husband also enters Ben's bedroom and his polite to Ben, where a more believable reaction would be to punch him in the face and call the police. Why is Mrs. Robinson so against Ben dating her daughter in the first place? We never find out.The characters actually have no depth (Mrs. Robinson's really just a sex object). It's actually badly written and badly directed.",

There was one stupid scene in it.Mrs. Robinson told Benjamin almost violently that he was not to date her daughter.In spite of this he shows up at her house to take her daughter out on a date.Now here is the stupid part:Benjamin tells Mrs. Robinson that he's taking her out because his parents told him that he would have to host a party if he didn't. HOW INCREDIBLY STUPID.ANDDo you remember what Mrs. Robinson was doing in that scene?She was watching TV.  Do you remember what she was watching?Johnny Caron on the Tonight Show.That TV show was aired at 11:30pm around most of the country.WHO PICKS UP THEIR DATE AT THAT HOUR ESPECIALLY ON A FIRST DATE?",

The film is culturally significant and a flawless work of cinematic art.\nThe filmBest-EVER Soundtrack Sync. #1 Greatest Comedy'The Graduate' is THE best movie comedy of all-time, ranking #1 on my IMDb \"Top 10 Greatest Comedies List\". The film is culturally significant and a flawless work of cinematic art.The film propelled director Mike Nichols and actor Dustin Hoffman to the top of the Hollywood A-List.For baby-boomers, this is an iconic film - a snap-shot of rapid cultural change that occurred in mid-1960s suburbia, complete with its post-college let-down, introspection, angst, and confusion.Baby boomers perceived things much differently than their Greatest Generation parents, and Nichols (along with screen-play writer Buck Henry) integrated the resulting \"generation-gap\" in a way no film had done before.Dustin Hoffman was fortunate to get the lead part as legend has it, and Nichols was fortunate to get him - both took advantage of the opportunity, and we are all fortunate they did so.The best soundtrack sync in movie history... One morning at the beginning of the film's production planning, Nichols had an epiphany about using the introspective and melancholy music of Simon & Garfunkel in the film - The resulting sound track \"music sync\" established what was then, a new standard for use of popular music as an integral part of story telling. NO film since then has done this better. Without that music sync, this would have been a fine film, but it would not have reached its legendary film status.Buck Henry's original screen-play delivers some very funny scenes - the hotel scenes running from the approximate 20 to 35 minute marks in the film are hilarious and everyone pulled it off to subtle perfection. Nichols ensured those comic moments were delivered with impeccable timing by utilizing Henry as a Day Player in the role of hotel manager.Anne Bancroft is brilliant and hot, and portrays her tragic and narcissistic character with perfection, in what has become an iconic film character.Much of the film's success is due to the performance of the ensemble cast. Nichols directs the movie like one of his stage productions where every line by every actor has impact.This is Mike Nichols' greatest and most important achievement in film, and over time has made many top 10 greatest comedy as well as all-time favorite movie lists. If one were to place slap-stick into its own separate genre (as so often the Chaplin and Marx Brothers films are cited as greatest comedies but are based largely on physical pantomime, not dialogue based comedy-drama), I believe this film is THE all-time greatest comedy in film.What else can I add that hasn't already been stated by many others?See 'The Graduate' again when the mood strikes.First timers, you are in for a treat.\"Here's to you Mrs. Robinson!\"",
