  "critic_reviews": [
    "The second film in Leone's Dollar trilogy finds the Italian director in better form than in A Fistful of Dollars. For a Few Dollars More has better writing, superior production values, and more characters who aptly complement Eastwood's stoic Man with No Name.",
    "While it doesn’t have the lunatic fervor of The Good, The Bad’s climatic cemetery shootout, For A Few Dollars more feels like its successor’s equal, which is about as great a compliment as I can bestow.",
    "A hard-hitting western with upper-case values out of the busy Italo stable, this is a topnotch action entry.",
    "It has a wealth of marvellous Western imagery, grotesque-comic business (Van Cleef striking a match on seething baddie Klaus Kinski’s hunchback), Ennio Morricone’s baroque score, iconic stars and unforgettable supporting faces.",
    "Leone's artful editing of close-ups to communicate the characters' spatial relationships is always a pleasure, and here he unveils his stylistic signature—extreme close-ups of the characters' eyes—as Van Cleef surveys the villain's wanted poster.",
    "Here is a gloriously greasy, sweaty, hairy, bloody and violent Western. It is delicious.",
    "Not as stylish as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, but a significant step forward from A Fistful of Dollars, with the usual terrific compositions, Morricone score, and taciturn performances, not to mention the ubiquitous flashback disease.",
    "The fact that this film is constructed to endorse the exercise of murderers, to emphasize killer bravado and generate glee in frantic manifestations of death is, to my mind, a sharp indictment of it as so-called entertainment in this day."

Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef are a joy to watch onscreen, with their friendship ultimately providing the most satisfying element of the entire experience (especially once the ending comes around). Major props also go to Gian Maria Volonte for bringing the dastardly, yet tortured spirit of \"el Indio\" into the fold and then some. You can see a lot of \"Once Upon A Time In The West\" in this, both thematically and narratively. And even though it's not as filmically brilliant as that film, it definitely ages better (subtextually speaking) and is simply more efficient overall. Great film.",

For a Few Dollard More is an amazing film though perhaps not as influential as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. There is one improvement over that film though, and that is the writing of Clint Eastwood's character, more developed and more compelling. A Fistful of Dollars is also great because of everything that makes TGTBATU and FAFDM so good, but I do consider the other two more influential on the genre and also Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which used the film as its inspiration, to be the superior film. Back to A Few Dollars More, the stylised visuals are stunning to look at, the scenery is the very definition of epic and the cinematography sweeps. Ennio Morricone's score is both elegiac and operatic in tone and the story of greed and revenge that focuses mainly on the pursuit of bandit Indio draws you right in and never lets go. The dialogue is peppered with grit and dark humour, which is well-balanced with neither over-powering the other, while Leone's direction is superb. Clint Eastwood plays his more developed character with immense charisma, Lee Van Cleef is suitably vengeful and again Gian Maria Volonte snarls convincingly. Overall, a wonderful film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

With a taut screenplay, tight editing, impressive camera work, Superb cinematography with beautifully framed shots, Morricone's atmospheric and slow-burning score, a nuanced direction and an unmatched chemistry between Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef, one of the most intimidating villains in a Western, I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said that For a Few Dollars More is about on par with Leone's masterpiece The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The latter is still my favourite of his, but I really think For a Few Dollars More has a more daring, challenging and unpredictable script! The complaint I have is that the first act is a bit too cheesy unlike the rest of the film. Hence, there is kind of a jarring tonal shift between the first and the second act.(9/10)",

Você arrepia, entra no clima, e o suspense chega ao nível máximo. Os personagens são ainda melhores, e o destaque dado ao Coronel funcionou muito bem. Junto com todo plot envolvendo o Índio e ele. Inclusive, plot esse que aumenta muito a proporção das coisas.A fotografia está excelente, com uns planos que chegam a encher os olhos. Algumas cenas são memoráveis, como o encontro entre o Coronel e Monco - Não posso deixar de mencioná-la. A atuação de forma geral está muito boa, junto com os efeitos práticos utilizados. O enredo é muito chamativo e cheio de revira voltas que não deixam que a obra caia em monotonismo, fora o desenvolvimento de personagem que está ótimo.Por fim, deixo aqui minha recomendação. Esse filme é essencial para quem é amante da sétima arte.",

Easwood - mean and moody etc. There's something charming about the budget English dubbing (from the original Italian, I believe) and (if anythng moreso) the instrumental, sometimes quite high pitched music played in the background. It is quite atmospheric and I enjoyed the battle or confrontation scenes. I think I liked that there are a number of young children and babies present in various scenes featuring the local villagers, giving an extra sense of urgency and fragility in terms of the innocents caught in the cross fires.I'm not sure I'd say its as good as the original 'Fistful of Dollars' film but its still a decent watch and I'd recommend it on that basis.",
