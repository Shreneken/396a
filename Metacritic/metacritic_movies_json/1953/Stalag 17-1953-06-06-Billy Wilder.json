  "critic_reviews": [
    "Stalag 17's irreverence likely didn't revolutionize moviemaking for adults so much as it paved the way for the likes of M*A*S*H and Animal House. Then again, that alone is an achievement worth celebrating.",
    "Unlike previous POW films, Wilder and co-writer Edwin Blum's script, based on the play by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski, presents the prisoners not as paragons of patriotic virtue but as real, self-interested, bored soldiers trying to survive. Holden is magnificent as the heel-turned-hero, but Stalag 17 is full of wonderful, well-directed performances.",
    "Stalag 17 is a black comedy before the term black comedy was coined.",
    "Stalag 17, despite often being labeled as one of Wilder's \"lesser\" films, is a bona fide classic, and an example of how an accomplished director can meld many elements into a workable whole.",
    "Wilder takes the Broadway play, as well as the genteel camaraderie familiar from the British POW films, shakes it all up, makes it tougher, funnier, cruder and subtler.",
    "A humorous, suspenseful, disturbing and rousing pastime.",
    "Interesting depiction with a pretty decent performance from Holden and supported by a credible cast.",
    "The legit hit about GI internees in a Nazi prison camp during the Second World War is screened as a lusty comedy-melodrama, loaded with bold, masculine humor and as much of the originalâ€™s uninhibited earthiness as good taste and the Production Code permit.",
    "It's chock-full of typical Wilder cynicism and the offhand transvestite humor that would reach its apotheosis in Some Like It Hot, but its wit falters as the melodramatic tension builds. The resulting letdown is terrific, but along the way there is some of the funniest men-at-loose-ends interplay that Wilder has ever put on film.",
    "The problem is that the two moods aren't properly cross-fertilised, with the resolute bleakness of the settings and Wilder's direction positing a reality that is constantly undercut by the comic opera crew of Germans headed by Preminger. A fascinating film, nevertheless."

Billy Wilder's subversive WW2 comedy / drama hits a home run most of the time.  Some of the unnecessary slapstick scenes, detract from the overall impact.  But whats left is still so strong, so insightful, satiric and a little bittersweet.",
