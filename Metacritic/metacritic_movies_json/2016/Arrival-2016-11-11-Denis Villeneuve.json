    "summary": "When mysterious spacecraft touch down across the globe, an elite team is put together to investigate \u2013 including language expert Louise Banks (Amy Adams). Mankind teeters on the verge of global war as everyone scrambles for answers \u2013 and to find them, Banks will take a chance that could threaten her life, and quite possibly humanity.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Arrival is really Adams' film, a showcase for her ability to quietly and effectively meld intelligence, empathy and reserve.",
        "Arrival works as mainstream entertainment, but includes hallmarks of the \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d/\u201cSilent Running\u201d era of artist-driven science fiction. It has Hollywood stars, but makes great effort to strip them of any false glamour. The film is tightly calibrated, but leaves things open to interpretation, for discussion on the ride home and beyond.",
        "Although Arrival is about first contact with extraterrestrials, it says more about the human experience than the creatures from another world. This is a singularly powerful movie, without question one of 2016\u2019s best.",
        "It's one of a handful of movies that have legitimately fooled me; not with an abrupt twist but a dawning awareness of where it's going thematically, how deeply and how distanced from sci-fi as usual.",
        "Adams gives her best performance as a lonely woman who has to make a decision that will haunt her \u2013 though perhaps in a good way \u2013 for the rest of her life.",
        "Arrival is such a beautiful and thought-provoking film that it almost singlehandedly makes up for every bad aliens-coming-to-Earth film you\u2019ve ever seen. Yes, even Independence Day: Resurgence.",
        "Arrival is a beautifully polished puzzle box of a story whose emotional and cerebral heft should enable it to withstand nit-picky scrutiny. And like all the best sci-fi, it has something pertinent to say about today\u2019s world; particularly about the importance of communication, and how we need to transcend cultural divides and misconceptions if we\u2019re to survive as a species.",
        "An intelligent, eloquent and stirring sci-fi that grips from start to finish, Arrival is up there with the year\u2019s best movies.",
        "[A] truly remarkable film.",
        "This is riveting, dizzying stuff from Villeneuve.",
        "The extraordinary success of Arrival is that it combines its bravura style and grand sci-fi questions with tremendous emotional intelligence and a heart so full it\u2019s ready to burst.",
        "That\u2019s the movie\u2019s greatest feint, though: Ultimately, it\u2019s far less interested in galactic destiny than the infinite, uncharted landscape of the human heart.",
        "Arrival, the shimmering apex of Villeneuve\u2019s run of form that started back in 2010 with \u201cIncendies,\u201d calmly, unfussily and with superb craft, thinks its way out of the black hole that tends to open up when ideas like time travel, alien contact and the next phase of human evolution are bandied about.",
        "It is intelligent, moving and wholly original.",
        "Anchored by an internalized performance from Amy Adams rich in emotional depth, this is a grownup sci-fi drama that sustains fear and tension while striking affecting chords on love and loss.",
        "A twisty, cerebral drama that just happens to involve aliens, Denis Villeneuve\u2019s film is a truly beguiling take on both the sci-fi canon and what, exactly, a grown-up Hollywood film is supposed to be.",
        "Arrival makes a moving case that we\u2019ve only scratched the surface of what we think is possible \u2014 and what we define as intelligence.",
        "Arrival is science fiction in the classic sense and a film of otherworldly ambition.",
        "Arrival would be nothing without Adams.",
        "I\u2019m not entirely convinced the ending is the perfect landing to everything that transpired before, but Arrival is not a linear adventure of the mind, and it is a film probably best seen twice.",
        "So much of the pleasure of Denis Villeneuve\u2019s poignant science-fiction drama Arrival lies in watching Amy Adams figure things out.",
        "Arrival puts Villeneuve, who first came to attention with \u201cIncendies,\u201d firmly in the first rank of filmmakers, a director capable of not just entertaining, but challenging. And the wide-eyed Adams, near the top of the list of the best actresses never to win an Oscar, delivers another riveting, melancholy and life-affirming performance that threatens to change that, maybe as soon as next February.",
        "Adams, her face a reflection of conflicting emotions, is simply stellar in an Oscar-buzzed performance of amazing grit and grace. Without her, Arrival might be too cerebral to warm up to. With her, the film gets inside your head and emerges as something intimate and epic, a linguistics odyssey through space and time. It's the stuff that dreams are made of.",
        "Adams\u2019s clear-eyed, open-minded doctor forces us to ask how much we\u2019re willing to communicate.",
        "Arrival has come, like a visitor from the cosmos, to blow minds and break hearts.",
        "Arrival isn\u2019t a visionary movie, an intellectual rebus or a head movie; it\u2019s pretty straight in some respects and sometimes fairly corny, with a visual design that\u2019s lovely rather than landmark.",
        "What\u2019s remarkable about Arrival is its contemplative core\u2014and, of course, Ms. Adams\u2019s star performance, which is no less impassioned for being self-effacing.",
        "For most of its running time, Arrival is entrancing, intimate, and moving \u2014 a sci-fi movie that looks not up at the stars but rather deep within.",
        "It may be weaker in the resolution than in the setup, but that is an inbuilt hazard of science fiction, and what lingers, days after you leave the cinema, is neither the wizardry nor the climax but the zephyr of emotional intensity that blows through the film.",
        "Arrival is a smart film, but it\u2019s not a cold or clinical one. Both the first and last scene brought me to the verge of tears.",
        "Despite some imperfections, Arrival is a close encounter with the best of intelligent, thoughtful science fiction.",
        "Arrivals becomes an unexpectedly moving rumination on life\u2019s bigger questions by its end. While it looks to other worlds, its main pleasure turns out to be the most intimate of questions.",
        "Arrival is a big, risky, showy movie which jumps up on its high-concept highwire and disdains a net. And yes, there are moments of silliness when it wobbles a little, but it provides you with spectacle and fervent romance.",
        "A deeply soulful film, shot through with loss, regret, and hope. Like almost all great sci-fi films it\u2019s less about the alien unknown than it is about the human condition.",
        "Muted, measured and meditative, Arrival brings taste and restraint to a genre in the midst of a mini golden age: It comes in peace.",
        "Shot under gray skies and in artful shadows by cinematographer Bradford Young, scored to wickedly disorienting music by Oscar-nominated \"Sicario\" composer Johann Johannsson, Arrival will cast a spell on some while merely discombobulating others. Right there, I'd say that indicates it's worth seeing.",
        "With its icy symphonic score (courtesy of Iceland\u2019s Johan Johansson) and a palette of rainy-day colors, Arrival is at once majestic and melancholy. It\u2019s a grand endeavor, and Adams, at the center of it all, brings pluck and smarts and a deep-seated sorrow to her role. This is her movie, no doubt.",
        "It\u2019s a movie designed to simultaneously challenge viewers, move them and get them talking. For the most part, it succeeds.",
        "Denis Villeneuve ponders the ramifications and possibilities of a potential first-contact between human beings and an advanced alien race and comes up with a sporadically incoherent film, but also some interesting ideas.",
        "It\u2019s not impossible to give audiences both a puzzle-box narrative and an exploration of life choices and what it means to be human, but the balance just doesn\u2019t play here.",
        "Arrival is a science fiction confection that wants to be smart. But the truly fascinating material that would have made this a very good movie rather than a pretty decent one likely ended up on what they used to call the cutting-room floor.",
        "Why did Villeneuve and the screenwriter, Eric Heisserer, let the grade-B military melodrama run away with the story?",
        "Arrival challenges viewers to a brainier sci-fi conundrum than they're used to, which makes for an intellectual breath of fresh air.",
        "Adams gives a nicely polished, muted performance: She keeps the story grounded when the ideas Villeneuve is striving for threaten to get too lofty. And the picture is intelligently and effectively crafted, one of those enterprises where the cinematography, sound design and score, as well as the special effects, melt into a seamless, organic whole.",
        "Adams draws on her gift for making each and every moment quiver with discovery. The actress is alive to what\u2019s around her, even when it\u2019s just ordinary, and when it\u2019s extraordinary the inner fervor she communicates is quietly transporting.",
        "Though the film is not more than sum of its parts, well, those parts are pretty great. You just wish they belonged to a slightly deeper film.",
        "The film's searching images counterpoint the hyper-articulate methodology of its characters' sense of imbalance and uncertainty.",
        "Watching it, I was excited that such a strange piece of science fiction got made\u2014and disappointed to realize that it is strange in just about all the ways that Interstellar is. But while even Nolan\u2019s detractors couldn\u2019t deny his skill at manufacturing awe, the primary emotion that Arrival evokes is puzzlement.",
        "To enjoy the film's arresting musings on language, time and how much we can ever understand others, you'll have to close your eyes and ears to the wealth of schlocky hokum surrounding them.",
        "Unless there\u2019s something truly momentous going on, I prefer my sci-fi to be a lot more weightless than weighty.",
        "The best science fiction leaves you with questions and ideas to ponder. Arrival is the sort of superficially profound movie that initially seems deep and weighty but stops making sense the moment you put down the bong.",
        "\"Enemy\" and \"Sicario\" were unspeakable disasters, and Arrival, the director\u2019s latest exercise in pretentious poopery, gives me every reason to believe I have parted company with Denis Villeneuve for good."

This is so self-important and ponderously dull that it makes Ingmar Bergman's depressive dramas seem like comic farces. The screenplay is all **** and pretension in which Amy Adams' language specialist amazingly deciphers the black ink vocabulary of the extra-terrestrials in record breaking time. A feat that only ever happens in the movies. The creatures themselves look like a cross between giant squids and an elephant's foot, and it's no exaggeration to state that their presence is underwhelming. The first ten minutes promise much but we never get that film. Instead as soon as the alien pods arrive degeneration in to boredom is immediate and sleep inducingly effective. Praised by the highbrow critics, make no mistake this is alarmingly over rated. A totally confused and uninteresting example of the sci-fi genre. Arrive? It certainly did. However, I couldn't wait to leave!",

It is one of the best rated and reviewed films of 2016, and is drawing comparisons to Close Encounters of The Third Kind, but I have a question, did they watch the same film that I did? I wasn't crazy about Close Encounters, but that movie was leaps and bounds ahead of this one. Twelve alien crafts land in random places all across the planet, and the people are in a panic. Some countries react with hostility, but the U.S. Government decides to act cautiously (yeah right), and send Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), the best linguist they have, to figure out a way to community with the aliens. The aliens, turn out to be giant octopus, whose language turns out to be ink that they squirt into the air. This movie features flashbacks and flash-forwards, that seemingly make no sense, until the end when you finally figure out what they mean and once you do, you realize that you just wasted two hours of your life. If that wasn't bad enough, the film moves at an absolute snails pace, I mean you could take everything that actually happened in the film and squeeze it into about twenty minutes. The rest is just people talking to each other about the same damn thing over and over again. Trying to figure out the same thing over and over again. Worrying about the same things over and over again. The characters have no personality whatsoever, and you might think that it's one of those slow moving weird films that all comes together in an amazing ending, but no, it doesn't. Once you can see the whole picture, as one lady in the theater so eloquently shouted out, \"really, that's it, that was so stupid.\" Her uncontrolled outburst really sums up this entire film. Honestly I think the slower and more artistic a film is, the more the critics love it, but I am one critic who isn't fooled by great actors and emotional music, this isn't the best film of the year, this is the biggest turd of the year, and it should be avoided at all costs!",

Personally I think it is about creating your own reality. The whole movie developes around the ability of a character to understand a language. In a way, Adams' character is a child (humanity) learning to speak. She has to go through all the tribulations of learning a new language, a powerful one at that. The premise is quite interesting and it took me two views to get it: Your language (the way you express what you think) determines your reality. They even mention it at the beginning of the movie, with the Sapir-Whorf theory. This is by far a very metaphysical proposal, and a very adecuate one at that, one that has been told to us by great master of ancient (\"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned\"). In a way, language IS reality, it is the only way we have to describe it and thus create it. So it would make sense that a more powerful language would create a different, more powerful reality. In the movie, learning the aliens' language would opne the doors of time and space for you, and this can be wither a weapon (as first understood by humans) or a gift, as later realized by Adams. Of course the ability to thread between past, present and future could be a powerful weapon, or a great gift. Once she realizes this, it is quite interesting that she still chooses to have her baby, aware of the outcome, but the most important choice she makes, while having the ability to visit the past or future, is to live in the present. Powerful message indeed. So now you know, choose your words carefully.",

I liked the nostalgic flashbacks shown, a reminder of childrens curiosity and wonder when faced with seeing certain things for the first time. Its a relatively atmospheric film, with looming music used in the background, not dissimilar to that present in other previous sci-fi films, most notably Close Encounters of the Third Kind. It also reminded me somewhat of Jodie Foster in the film Contact from the 1990s.Its a somewhat deep film that makes you think about how threats are handled, at a global level, the responses by various governments and the like. If anything, I found it refreshing that in this instance, the US didn't exactly go in 'all guns blazing' and I appreciated that the main character, Louise Banks, tries very hard to understand and see things from the unknowns' point of view. I don't think I can say much more but suffice to say, I recommend this film.",

Arrival proves to be one-of-a-kind and one of the best in the genre, not just for pure action or the cliches we tend to see in such movies, but for its creativity and thought-provoking ideas it presents to the viewer. It is a movie that does require utmost attention, however, the experience is truly rewarding, as director, Denis Villeneuve continues his run of exceptional movies. Amy Adams, who plays a linguistic professor, leads the movie with a strong performance, yet playing a vulnerable character who succumbs to the events that unfold. The 'arrivals' themselves are wonderfully designed and their language particularly is a topic in on itself. Crafted with great cinematography and moving music, this was a deserved Oscar-nominated film, and truly one for the ages.",

A much discussed and sometimes feared story has come true which, honestly, always sounded a bit ridiculous to actually happen in the real world.I am, of course, talking about this new sci-fi drama \u201eArrival\u201c where mankind is greeted by huge alien spaceships in the sky who seem to be coming in peace\u2026 wait, did you think I was referring to Trump becoming the next leader of the free world?But yeah, these two events have a very similar plot summary so it\u2019s only fitting that I had the chance to experience them in the very same morning.Directed by Denis Villeneuve \u2013 the man behind \u201ePrisoners\u201c, mindbending \u201eEnemy\u201c with Jake Gyllenhaal, \u201eSicario\u201c and currently filming \u201eBlade Runner\u201c sequel \u2013, one could expect \u201eArrival\u201c to be a thinking person\u2019s sci-fi. And one is not wrong.It is a 116 minute slow-burner all heavy on atmosphere and light on explosions or any quick thrills. If you wish a quick reference to any recent well-known movies, the result is a bit like Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201eInterstellar\u201c crossed with Terrence Malick\u2019s \u201eThe Tree of Life\u201c. Robert Zemeckis\u2019s \u201eContact\u201c (1997) would not be very far either, because \u201eArrival\u201c also focuses on fragile yet brave female protagonist whose quality acting is one of the main pillars carrying the whole experience. The other one would be overall atmosphere, deliciously dark and ominous. Some will like it, others will probably find it depressing and maybe a bit slow for their taste.I haven\u2019t read the award-winning short story by Ted Chiang that \u201eArrival\u201c is based on. Wikipedia says that the major themes explored are determinism, language and Sapir-Whorf hypothesis which sounds mighty dry and mostly sci-fi geek friendly. So it\u2019s nice to witness movie makers adding some mainstream appeal which comes mostly in the form of Amy Adams\u2019s great performance. She truly holds the movie together as a woman going where no-one has ever gone before. You will believe her hesitations, the tears, and also the silent determination when the going gets tough. This kind of role is tricky because of the need to play it out mostly alone, often in close-up where every detail and tone has to be clearly seen and felt. Think Matthew McConaughey's mighty turn in \u201eInterstellar\u201c but decidedly less showoffish.So it\u2019s mostly Adams\u2019s one-woman-show, and a quite rare chance to see her doing something memorable and worthwhile on screen. She accepts too many decorative pretty girl roles, even in more ambitious projects. The all-male supporting cast is good too, especially star players such as Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker. As stated above, I don\u2019t know the original story but \"Arrival's\" message is rather spiritual and not \"dry\" at all. Essentially it is a reminder that mankind\u2019s future depends heavily on our ability to understand and connect to the world, rather than attacking and overpowering everything we find foreign or downright alien. It\u2019s a call to rise above the inflexible ego-based mind the western society so dearly values, and to find balance with our intuitive side.Overall, \u201eArrival\u201c is a good movie although I wasn\u2019t especially happy with the final act which seemed rushed. It felt like somebody grew impatient near the end and wanted to add something \u201eimpressive\u201c just in case the people were not happy with this slow-moving tale. I do not want to talk about it here in detail but, for me, it lessened some of the movie\u2019s overall impact. Mostly because there was not enough time to play it out as properly as the stuff that had come before.But yeah, if you are into more intelligent sci-fi and don\u2019t prioritize explosions, \u201eArrival\u201c is good to go.",

While Arrival\u2019s initial presentation may seem jarring and somewhat flawed, as the movie progresses and the twist is revealed, the editing choices and the pseudo-confusing sequencing end up contributing to the movie's meaning as a larger whole. Arrival explores various linguistic and psychological theories and takes them to an extreme, even using them as the crux for its storytelling. While it does benefit the viewer to be familiar with psychological concepts, especially linguistic determinism, the film does a good job explaining the fundamental concepts the story is based upon. Arrival is not only a cautionary tale but also a hopeful one. Arrival purports that through cooperation and coordination, i.e. through avoiding competition, a future which benefits more to a greater degree can be achieved.

Amy Adams is a good actor, and she does yeoman\u2019s work here, but she breaks no new ground.   The movie is a \u201cFail\u201d almost every other level.  Forest Whitaker is wooden, and The Notebook like story within a story is lame.Amy Adams plays Dr. Louise Banks, a linguist, trying to figure out how to speak to aliens that have arrived at earth in dark, giant, scary looking, pods that look like slag. The aliens have no spoken or alphabet based written language.   Instead, the aliens converse using ink blots (which look like the stain that a wine glass might leave on a cardboard coaster, and made me wonder if the writer came up with the whole idea while sitting at a bar.)  Equally boring and conventional are the aliens.  (Why do aliens always seem to have squid-like bodies?)Dr. Banks is apparently the only gifted linguist left in the world, and the gov\u2019t seeks out her expertise to the exclusion of all others.  (Ugh!)  Dr. Banks speculates that the aliens are so advanced that they have no apparent way to communicate with humans, and thus it is up to the humans to figure out how to communicate with them.  (Groan!)  For Kumbaya reasons, the aliens have split the message they want to convey to the people of earth into 12 parts, and use 12 different space craft to deliver it to 12 different populations across the earth. (Ay Yi Yi!)  Of course, the reaction of earth people is to go loot Best Buy and then try to blow up the aliens.There is a story within the story about time travel (Oh no!) and Amy Adams daughter who, we learn early on, has died from some rare disease.  This is supposed to give the movie its heart, but when you separate out the two movies halves, neither part has enough weight to give the movie any real substance.

The film is not only a disservice to Ms. Adams\u2019 talent but to the audience that must suffer through the picture  as well.

What amazes me most is that so many professional critics found this movie to be worthy of their highest rating, again proving that being paid for an opinion doesn\u2019t mean it has value. I give this film a 1.0 rating and if I hadn\u2019t been in the company of my wife and friends, I would have walked out of the theater mid way through it.

What was said to make her husband leave? How could she figure out what was being said? Was it \"flash back\" or flash forward\" or \"flash sideways\"? Why was Costello dying? Why did the story take the audience through the back door (again) to find us at the beginning? Did this happen? Was it going to happen? Did one of the last lines allow us to think that maybe the end results that have been seen will be changed? As for the production: Why were the interiors so dark? To save money.

It was a choice of seeing this movie or \u201cRules Don\u2019t Apply\u201d and I am not a fan of Warren Beatty\u2019s and I understand it is really a flop so I decided on \u201cArrival\u201d.The main reasons I was interested in seeing \u201cArrival\u201d was because I am becoming a big fan of Amy Adams and on YouTube I saw a video titled \u201cArrival Ending Explained\u201d which intrigued me though I didn\u2019t watch it until after I saw the movie.The first hour of the movie was like watching a foreign language film without subtitles and didn\u2019t hold me interest at all. The second hour with the 12 egg-shaped UFOs all over the world set up the standard them versus us but that isn\u2019t where it goes.Amy Adams is Dr. Louise Banks, is a language expert, who had a daughter who died at the age of 12, and is called on to help make contact with the aliens who are named Abbot & Costello by the theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly, played by Jeremy Renner, who brings the  very rare humor in the movie. They work together in ways not exactly up to what Colonel Weber, (Forest Whitaker) and a CIA agent played by Michael Stuhlbarg want from them.The film revolves around Adams and Renner with little time for the other actors except for an important cameo by Tzi Ma who plays the Chinese leader though it is Adams who holds your attention every time she is on screen which is through the whole film.The film is not about them versus us but about time and how it can be looked at in different ways. We see many scenes with the mother and daughter from birth until her death 12 years later and by the ending these scenes all are looked at in a way that we weren\u2019t aware while watching them.The ending is done subtly by the director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer instead of hammering the audience over the head but I really wished I had watched that YouTube video before I saw the film.Adams performance is constrained, as it should be, where it could have been melodramatic. When it comes to her what it all is about she calmly accepts and understands what is happening and what happened. Renner is very strong support for her performance.This is not an \u2018entertaining\u2019 film in the sense you can sit back, munch on your popcorn and enjoy aliens invading earth but to which you have to think.\u201cArrival\u201d for the most part is a boring film except for the last 15 minutes and I didn\u2019t think the time invested was really worth the first 101 minutes and time is what the film is all about.",

Maybe if I knew more of what to expect going in, because I expected sci fi/thriller type along the lines of Prometheus and Interstellar. While this movie starts out very promising with a lot of intrigue about the alien visitors, it soon drags, devolving into a commentary on human existence that really isn't emotionally moving or anything. There is a twist to the movie that was mildly interesting but seemed very copy cat of Interstellar, and then it ended very abruptly. I hated the ending. Basically there was no explanation of the reasoning behind anything and you are left hanging. It's just supposed to make you appreciate your humanity and question your life choices I guess.The one positive though is the acting throughout is superb. Even the dialogue is fine, just the pacing and ending are awful.",

I liked Jeremy Renner in other movies like The Town, so I thought I would watch this one. I was pretty disappointed and could not give more than a 6. It seems he did not get enough acting in and even looked quiet at times like his lines were cut out. I don't see him in a romantic role either and the music was too overwhelming for me.

The film is an unusual discovery, it starts emotionally, moves in a deliberate pacing, slowly builds up a puzzle of complex paradox and ends up stunningly impactful, amplifying the questions of existential dilemma. It does not need any action sequences, it is all about life, language and unity that bring to the twisted concept of the overall plot development with several hints throughout the entire story, further surprising audiences to view it from different fascinating ways. Amy Adams gains respects for her brilliant performance as a believable thinker and expert communicator while her emotions are handled well in order to engage the entire structure of the film. The theme song \"On the Nature of Daylight\" in both the opening and ending of the movie, as well as scores composed by Johann Johannsson enhance the the atmosphere of the film especially the thrilling suspense of invasions, the horror moments during the contact and the emotional depth on life perception. The arrival of the extra terrestrial amazes viewers on how creatively a science fiction may diverge from its generic aspects and link to life - telling us that life is a journey without destination and to live as if the answer is, even if you have known everything about the future.",

That's the effect Arrival had on me. Every new development filled me with a sense of childlike wonder and caused my interest in the film's otherworldly visitors to grow even deeper. Tensions understandably rise as twelve spacecrafts arrive across the globe and humanity races to find out why. It's far from an original set up for a sci-fi movie, but what sets apart this quest to discover extraterrestrial motives is the approach taken. You'll notice the familiar elements of human paranoia and governmental mistrust running in the background, but Arrival's main focus is on the establishment and discovery of communication. That is what makes all the difference.The imaginative and complex method of conveyance crafted for this film is nothing less than brilliant. It really sells the outer space lifeforms as real, intelligent creatures. Of course that is also helped by how good the film looks (minus Amy Adams' CGI spaghetti hair). The film's core idea of deciphering a dialect and written language unlike anything we know seems like something that would be an insurmountable challenge, but it reminds us that this has been done before when humans discovered each other living on completely different sides of the planet. Arrival's intelligent handling and understanding of linguistics makes what could have been a boring process something that is fascinating to watch unfold. The big reveal is one heck of a revelation. It causes the final leg of the film to take an interesting turn. While it goes off in a different and kind of strange new direction, it speaks to something so human that it's hard to not appreciate it. This is of course bolstered by the incredible performance from Adams. She's got other talented people alongside her in the cast, but it's really up to her to carry the movie. Something she does so exquisitely that the lack of even a nomination for an Oscar is baffling. Arrival is such a breath of fresh air for the sci-fi genre. It shows off a level of intelligence and believability that feels all too rare, and it manages to do so with the old \"are they friend or foe?\" approach that's been done so many times before. Something that speaks highly of Denis Villeneuve's ability and shows that apparently there are ways to mine new depth from even among the most overused concepts. In closing, Arrival is absolutely captivating and it might just be the best sci-fi film I've ever seen.",
