  "critic_reviews": [
    "Meet the Blacks is an asinine film (though with a kernel of seriousness) but whenever it feels like it is running out of steam, something strange and surreal will happen to elevate it above a typical spoof movie.",
    "It’s more like an extremely confusing and sloppily written chunk of Purge fan-fiction—a tortured use of another movie’s absurd mythology to help make muddled quasi-satirical points, while indulging the apparently fail-safe punchline of saying the word “purge” about once a minute.",
    "Even by the standards of raunchy, comic spoofs, director and co-writer Deon Taylor’s film feels especially scattered.",
    "A wrongheaded, utterly incompetent, and nearly laugh-free satire."

Trust me, I've seen some so-so spoof movies and let me tell you. There's more sh*tty spoof movies than so-so. Meet The Blacks will leave you without words because you will feel dumb and confused once you're done with it. I wanted to walk out but I needed more reasons to take a sh*t on this movie. I just hate how these so called actors think they're making something funny when in fact they're making themselves look stupid. Guys, just watch The Purge because that's already a joke. Forget this movie happened.",

He is Just a Hateful person and due to recent comments he made about Boxer Manny Pacquiao and President Obama. Double standard i think this be the last movie with him featured in it. Due to his Rape conviction Tyson is banned to travel to some countries so it is very interesting for him to  be in this Movies and critique the current president. Did Tyson really cared about the feelings of the woman he raped. Lets not forget about Mike Tyson who supports Donald Trump and Tyson made very bad comments about president Obama to.   I wouldnt pay the bootleg guy at the beauty shop $5 for that movie. To bad he didnt retire with Grace and SILENCE.",
