    "critic_reviews": [
        "I\u2019m not qualified to say whether it\u2019s an effective delivery system for its Christian message, but I think I can credibly pronounce it a good popcorn movie.",
        "In spite of its various imperfections, Ben-Hur always manages to entertain, proving the timelessness of epic structure and scale. And even if nothing about the movie particularly stands out on its own, when all the pieces come together, one cannot help but feel immersed in the world and ideals presented.",
        "The Wyler film\u2019s rousing chariot sequence\u2014filmed separately and at lavish expense by Andrew Marton and Yakima Canutt, one of the greatest stuntmen who ever lived \u2014 is hard to beat. But Bekmambetov acquits himself nicely, offering up a loud and vicious circular chase, with point-of-view shots of people getting hit by chariots as armored Romans scamper around like rodeo clowns.",
        "In paring down and streamlining its source material, this new version also saps its heft.",
        "Surprisingly, many of Bekmambetov\u2019s updates work well.",
        "This Ben-Hur is closer to an \u201880s actioner about two men who once loved each other parting ways, only to reunite and settle their differences through vicious means.",
        "Let's cut to the chariot chase. The latest screen version of Ben-Hur would be little more than a condensed miniseries without it, framed for small television screens, with performances to fit.",
        "An amateurish effort that boasts direct-to-video characteristics, the latest version disappoints in almost every production aspect.",
        "The new Ben-Hur isn't much of an improvement. Dominated by CGI effects, it's a soap opera better fit for basic cable.",
        "Everyone, from director to cast, seems so rushed that there\u2019s no time for romance, less time for leaps of faith and every moment of conversion is abrupt, dictated by the script and not by the heart.",
        "That Morgan Freeman voice! It\u2019s so rich and full and authoritative that even when he\u2019s telling Judah, \u201cOK, OK,\u201d you almost believe people used that word in the year 33. If they were very progressive.",
        "The leading actors labor valiantly and to little effect.",
        "Ben-Hur struggles to find an identity and never really gets there. The well-intentioned efforts to achieve moving, faith-based awakenings are undercut by the casually violent, PG-13 action sequences.",
        "This arena, unfortunately, is no Thunderdome. The chariot race is sloppily framed, choppily edited, and droopily choreographed, with special effects that look like they needed another few passes through the CGI machine.",
        "All the flash and sizzle of modern movie effects can't make up for a once spectacular tale that feels not just scaled-down, but shrunk.",
        "Timur Bekmambetov\u2019s Ben-Hur remake offers robust spectacle and some decent performances. But ultimately, the director of Wanted and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is, perhaps unsurprisingly, not the ideal filmmaker to capture this timeless story\u2019s more nuanced emotional range.",
        "As Judah Ben-Hur \u2013 full names, please \u2013 Huston is serviceable, but he\u2019s a finer actor than this costumed kitsch allow him to be. As Judah\u2019s boyhood best friend and adoptive brother, Messala, against whom Judah will eventually square off in the Roman Circus, Toby Kebbell has even less to work with than Huston, and he bears a disconcerting resemblance to motivational guru Tony Robbins.",
        "The good news is that the story of Ben-Hur is so rock solid that not even the director of \u201cAbraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\u201d can screw it up completely.",
        "Wanted director Timur Bekmambetov stresses spectacle over subtext \u2013 and, effectively, leaves the cast floundering fast.",
        "Taking the worst of it on the chin is star Jack Huston, whose Jewish prince turned galley slave, Judah Ben-Hur, suffers from a distinct lack of personality\u2014he\u2019s like a boulder that someone forgot to chisel into a statue.",
        "Overseen by a director not known for his human touch and lacking a name star, except for Mr. Freeman, Ben-Hur feels like a film made on the cheap, although it looks costly.",
        "As directed by Timur Bekmambetov, this 21st century Ben-Hur is more phlegmatic than awful, a by and large dull and lethargic piece of work that is not bad enough to get mad at. What it lacks most of all is a convincing reason to exist.",
        "It\u2019s an adequate retelling, mostly, but with moments of eye-rolling ineptitude.",
        "Minus a hero who has the macho charisma to wrap a movie around him like he owned it, the new Ben-Hur is an oddly lackluster affair: sludgy and plodding, photographed (by Oliver Wood) in nondescript medium close-up, an epic that feels like a mini-series served up in bits and pieces.",
        "Cheap and cheesy at every level, this Ben-Hur barely qualifies as an epic. It\u2019s a wholly unnecessary addition to the venerable franchise.",
        "Bekmambetov and Co. have created a redesigned product that is at once inferior to the original and a slavish imitation.",
        "This Ben-Hur may not be an epic fail, but its steady stream of shortcomings are certainly a cautionary journey for anybody with the hubris to try and rebuild the monuments of movies past.",
        "It\u2019s not the unmitigated disaster early reviews suggested. Instead, it is a blandly competent and doggedly uninspired redo of material adapted a half-dozen times already.",
        "Misguided, diminished and dismally done in every way, this late-summer afterthought will richly earn the distinction of becoming the first Ben-Hur in any form to flop.",
        "The last of the summer's movie epics is a digitalized eyesore hobbled in every department by staggering incompetence.",
        "The problem comes down to this: If you take the spirituality out of Ben-Hur, you take the Ben-Hur out of Ben-Hur.",
        "As the new Ben-Hur unspools into insignificance and sentimentality, there are fleeting moments that suggest someone behind this $100-million movie was actually thinking hard about how to replay a schlocky biblical epic for a secular audience in 2016.",
        "Ben-Hur director Timur Bekmambetov offers nothing new to the cinematic lexicon of the chariot race.",
        "There\u2019s a fatally miscast lead (Jack Huston, you are no Charlton Heston), cut-rate special effects, reams of eyeball-glazing dialogue, and a schmaltzy \u201cinspirational\u201d script that pointlessly alters the story in ways that make absolutely no sense."

As a movie this one is pretty good; diffidently recommend it. I knocked two points off- one for the script (the depth could of been better) and one for all that they cut out (which is understandable seeing how this shaves a couple hours off the original). Not much else to say without spoiling. Just keep in mind people, in a world were it's accepted and even encouraged to kill kids (abortion), of course anything having to do with Jesus/God is going to get hated on.

The original Ben Hur was a record breaking, Oscar laden epic that employed the old school styles of acting, colour and cheesy special effects with such assured confidence that it almost defied criticism. This Ben Hur invites it, even if ultimately it is not as bad as cynical naysayers would have us believe. The original Judah, Charlton Heston, took the whole thing incredibly seriously turning in an Oscar winning performance which cemented his appeal in this type of sword and sandals pic. I\u2019m afraid that Jack Huston\u2019s lack of screen presence and charisma will not be doing the same for him. His Ben Hur, along with the rest of the cast actually, is one dimensional and colourless complimenting, in fact, the surprisingly drab production values. Director Timur Bekmambetov keeps the camera in close for many scenes which has the effect of dissipating any chance of an epic aura. To add to this the actors\u2019 line delivery is often flat and unconvincing. This adds immeasurably to the amateurish feel that the production can\u2019t seem to dispel for much of its running time. Still, two sequences work very well indeed aided no end by some wonderful camera shots, precise editing and impressive special visual effects. Firstly, the chariot race is good enough, and long enough, to stand favourable comparison to the earlier film and the galley slave scenes are also up to par in their excitement value. Not a complete disaster then, but it is another remake that is as misjudged and second rate as it is unnecessary.",

I am sure it would be great and probably better then this version despite being filmed under ancient photography conditions.  However, be that as it may, I enjoyed this movie very much.  Although nobody will probably ever out act Charlton Heston as Judah Ben Hur, I thought the acting was more than acceptable.  Of course, I don't think there is anybody who can surpass the acting of Morgan Freeman either.  I just love to see any movie he is in and they are all usually fairly good.  Although the story is certainly not plausible at all, neither were the other movies based on the book.  The book is a work of fiction after all.  If you never saw the 1959 movie with Heston as Judah Ben Hur, you have nothing to compare this one to, so just sit back and enjoy the movie.",

That's because it focuses on it's story first, and preaching second.Now one thing I can't do in this review is compare this remake to the original as I have not seen it. I can say though that it should be fairly obvious this movie isn't going to have the same impact as the original. At the very least though, it is entertaining.Spread across the tale of Ben-Hur's quest for vengeance are Christian themes and messages. You'll see Jesus and hear characters talk about how one should forgive their enemies instead of seeking revenge. These elements are thankfully not very heavy handed in their delivery, making them more bearable for non-believers. They do feel oddly included though. Like unnatural additions to the main plot that could have already been a story of forgiveness all on it's own.The main plot in the movie pretty solid and backed by equally solid performances. Just like the faith-based elements, it can feel uneven in execution. It does have the tendency to meander a bit from time to time, and when it finally does get to the fateful chariot race it's  full-throttle all the way to the conclusion. Speaking of that chariot race, it's quite thrilling to watch. There's one other moment of big-spectacle excitement to be found. The rest of the emphasis is on the story and characters, some of which go underdeveloped and just feel like bland faces meant to push the story forward.While lacking in truly epic moments, the ones it does have are still exciting to watch. Brought to life by solid special effects and a director who apparently knows how to put on some solid fireworks.While perhaps uneven in it's execution, Ben-Hur is a faith-based film that has the potential to entertain more than just hardcore believers. That's because it's part big action, special effects driven blockbuster with a strong emphasis on character drama. The themes of forgiveness are appreciated and it's a very relatable story in a sense in that appeals to emotions we've all felt. So it's definitely brought to life in all of the best ways, but at least it still manages to be fun.7.4/10",

The cast gives a superb performance that really conveys the story in an an impactful, emotional way. The depiction of galley slave life on its own as well as the chariot races, stand out as amazingly powerful conveyances of little shown aspects of the Roman Empire.

Not the director but the script seems to be teh villain of this piece. The dialogue while occasionally good, even effective especially seems off the mark.  It so clearly lacks a singular vision of characters, what they are learning, or any singular vision of the plot.  I found the Christ story, tacked on s it is, still affecting.  As other reviewers have asked, \"Tell me again, WHY was this re-make necessary?\"",

There were some high-energy moments and a few good crashes, but this scene (and the whole film) just felt lax. This epic follows the conflict of 2 half-brothers in the time of Jesus: one is a Jewish price and the other a Roman. With the exception of the big boat battle, there's little dramatic tension. Ben-Hur's more concerned about emotional engagement than conflict, so we get a heartfelt drama when we want spectacle.

Otherwise I'd miss many of the best movies I've seen.To be honest, after the crappy disasters of supposedly Christian movies meant to be directly based on the Bible that's Russell Crowe's weird \"Noah\" and Christian Bale's pathetic \"Exodus: Gods and Kings\", I almost gave up all hope of these un-Christian movies in Christian movie clothing, full of unashamed inauthenticity. So I decided to watch a movie that is NOT directly based on the Bible, Jack Huston's \"Ben Hur\", and it turned out to be more Christian than Noah or Exodus combined - all in a pretty epic movie!Given this is based on the book and being the 2nd movie made with the same name, the plot is no surprise. At high level, it's a story of 2 brothers who went their separate ways due to a misunderstanding and betrayal, where hate drove them closer and closer to killing each other, but in the end found that forgiveness was more powerful than vengeance. Now that would make a boring story if it wasn't for strong acting and scripting, and of course, the epic action scenes (the ship / galley and horse racing scenes in particular) which were done with absolute purpose, woven into the very story itself. Where's the Christian part of it? Well, Ben-Hur lives in the same period as Jesus Christ and so we find Ben-Hur and his family occasionally experiencing Jesus' wisdom and love. Of course, Jesus' narrative is only the backdrop and he only makes a couple of appearances. (this is not a Jesus film - for that, try Passion of the Christ!). Jack Huston and Toby Kebbell held strong chemistry as brothers in the movie - going from close brotherhood to distant enemies and reconciled as brothers again. Jack Huston proves to be a versatile actor, exuding joviality, confidence, hatred, joy, tenderness - expressing the right emotions at the right times. Morgan Freeman plays Ilderim, a good supporting role in helping Ben-Hur face his brother in the final showdown.This is one movie I would happily watch with the family. The values are wholesome, the action is epic, the movie is simply beautiful. Well worth the watch. One of the best movies I watched so far. And yes, of course it's better than the original - this is made in 2016 with better technology supporting the actors!",

So remake means we expect nothing less than a visual spectacular and this film had them at its best, including many more great features, but the real stars are missing. It was a let down without any notable performances. Besides, the idea of upgrading the story was good, though not everyone going to like that. Particularly the one who loved the old film or the versions.The length is justified. For the kind of story the film narrates, the pace was very good. So for me this is not a bad flick, but just some key features missing like I said the star value. For the first timers, like today's generation, this film might work, but for the others most probably not. And the end was disappointing, because it felt like watching a Disney film that made for children and families.I think the director of 'Wanted' did his job as it required. Definitely not an unnecessary remake, but should have been careful in the historic events. Overall, it fell short of depth. You won't feel emotions and/or the character's struggle. In the end it became just an entertainment product and if you expect beyond that, you are only responsible for that. So good luck with the watch if you are yet to give it a try.5/10",

Good try...but again, totally unnecessary.",

I enjoyed the soundtrack and end credits music (sung by Andra Day) along with the cinematography, maybe this is just me. Have a nice day and remember that everyone has a different opinion, so watch movies for yourself and give recommendations to others. (Also I'm not Christian).",
