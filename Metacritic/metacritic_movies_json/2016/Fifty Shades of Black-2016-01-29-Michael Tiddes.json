    "Comedy"
  ],
  "summary": "A parody of the popular film/novel 50 Shades of Grey.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "\"Black” foregoes too much scene-setting, chronology and logic to stand completely on its own. As a piece of cultural criticism, however, it painstakingly eviscerates nearly every scene in “Grey” and skewers latent sexism, classism and ludicrous sexual innuendoes, as well as the original’s numerous plot holes.",
    "The film manages to be surprisingly subversive with its humor.",
    "When Wayans allows himself to deviate from his formula there are a few effective moments of un-self-conscious slapstick.",
    "As with other staples of the screen-parody genre, the comic bull’s-eyes arrive only intermittently.",
    "Mostly, Fifty Shades of Black is exactly what you expect it will be. It hits all the notes of its source material, only it amps them up, and it seems to get the inherent absurdity of this premise even more than Sam Taylor-Johnson’s movie did.",
    "An aimless, if sporadically clever, parody that tirelessly conceives of human sexuality as punchlines for its shortsighted cultural ribbings.",
    "Marlon Wayans is clearly getting off on the gags, but the lazy, hard humor, and elastic joke-making eventually has a numbing effect.",
    "At a minimum, a parody should be funnier than the film it’s sending up, but Fifty Shades of Black, a quick-and-dirty riff on last year’s S&M romance “Fifty Shades of Grey,” falls a laugh or two short of even that low standard.",
    "Adults may respond with a laugh every once in a while, but they’re unlikely to find Fifty Shades of Black a nonstop titter fest.",
    "The funniest bit involves a particularly sadistic brand of torture that he inflicts on Hannah.... She quite rightly screams in protest, as should anyone forced to watch this movie.",
    "A slapdash movie that’s more unbearable than the heavy-breathing best-seller and its emotionally timid screen adaptation."

      "content": "It was only a matter of time that someone came along and spoofed the widely popular and highly alluring pop-culture phenomenon that was Fifty Shades of Grey. What isn’t surprising is that spoof specialist and kinda, sorta washed upIt was only a matter of time that someone came along and spoofed the widely popular and highly alluring pop-culture phenomenon that was Fifty Shades of Grey. What isn’t surprising is that spoof specialist and kinda, sorta washed up actor/writer Marlon Wayans was the one to do so. Wayans, whose previous parody films include A Haunted House 1 & 2, Dance Flick and Scary Movie 1-4 brings forth a very important question with his newest spoof feature Fifty Shades of Black; is the spoof film finally, officially dead?\r Its hard to believe but, after such classics as Airplane!, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery and yes, even the original Scary Movie, the spoof film may slowly if not almost entirely die off and be resting in peace very soon.\r The world, currently, is one that is obsessed with social media platforms and media within these social networks. Thanks to applications such as Vine, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and YouTube, it seems that audiences everywhere are capable of finding comedy and entertainment, not only within the comfort of their own homes, but as easily and accessibly, within moments, in the palms of their hand.\r When the dawn of the television was upon us, people everywhere thought that televisions were going to destroy Hollywood and the history of feature films altogether; it didn’t. With the rise of the Internet and the quickly developing moment of streaming and illegally downloading films and music online, people soon thought that the future of movies and music was on its way on the decline. Yet, in 2015 no less, two of the highest grossing films of all-time were released, and more than ever, the profitability of music has never been better. So, how and why is the spoof film genre dying slowly but surely?\r The thing about entertainment in 2016 is that, entertainment isn’t merely measured but numbers and margins, but by memories and moments of experience and spectacle, with margins and numbers as well. Entertainment is constantly evolving, and the forms in which we consume entertainment maintains the ways in which we determine whether the entertainment itself is viable, or not. The thing with earlier spoof films like the ones that were mentioned above are, in order to consume such comedy, going to the movie theatres and watching it for yourself was the only way of consumption. Now a days, not only are films, genres and characters spoofed on the daily, but pop culture, with the help of social media, spoofs the crap out of anything and everything. Don’t think thats the case? Think back, just in 2015, to all the spoofs you saw online about Adele’s song Hello, Drake’s music video to Hotline Bling, as well as anything else flooding the front pages of your Vine, Instagram and Facebook news feeds.\r The beauty behind the genius in the earlier spoof films of the 80’s and 90’s was that accessibility was limited and, these films weren’t just spoofing a specific movie, having limited content to work with. Think of Austin Powers for example, it wasn’t just a spoof on spy films and a filmography of more than a dozen Bond films at that time, but also a genre, the unbelievability of a lifestyle or profession little to nothing is known about, as well as providing a fantasy for the possibility of the many beauties the life of what an international person of mystery might really be like. Sure, Black may spoof Kim K for a second, the Weeknd here and there, but overall, these small and insignificant and highly forgettable inclusions did nothing to elevate the plot or humour of the film overall.\r If you’re wondering why I haven’t really mentioned the plot line or story of Black, well, thats because the film is basically a shot-for-shot carbon copy of the original Grey film, with added crass and crude black jokes included, sexual innuendoes juiced up to the max and of course, taking what the original did, and making it funny by stripping away its glamorous and polished exterior; essentially,  making it real world scary for real life people. No matter how you look at it, regardless of how much money you have, any girl would be scared of having a wealthy man stalking you at work asking for ropes and zip-ties regardless how cute he may be.\r What I found super interesting with Black was how the film is slowly accepting and transitioning from movie stars, to social media stars starring within feature films. Sure we’ve seen Vine stars make cameos in films before, like Brittany Furland in last year’s We Are Your Friends, but in Black, social media icon King Back/Andrew Bachelor has a very prominent role as the not so subtle yet hysterical best friend Jesse that wants a piece, like any other straight male friend wants from their female friends. Bach represents not only a dominance of social media within feature films, but perhaps, the next phase and new generation of movies stars tomorrow. Plus, is it just me or does Bach remind anyone else of a younger Will Smith circa his ‘Fresh Prince of Bel-Air’ days.",

At first we refused to see FSOG because other reviews and basically didnt want to see \"soft porn\" We walked out of 50 SHADES OF BLACK about 40 minutes in. It was basically a hijack of our sensitivity senses and allowed black men to use the word **** and \"Sex\" in a real **** made movie and make money off those words.\rWe decided to watch FSOG after viewing black and it wasnt as raunchy and demeaning as we thought it would be. Dont waste your time or money on this flop. Its completely stupid, not even close to being funny unless you are black and enjoy and modern likeness to the series roots. Yes, its a baste and lethargic mental attack on white people. Its nothing like his brothers parodies of other productions. We actually demanded and received our money back from Regal Entertainment and that is why we are still current customers of that company. Hopefully the peekaboo was actually Kali's top, that would be the only justification of the movie getting paid. As far as specifics.. It was rude and disgusting. A dirty rag on both races and you already know the ending...It was the worst movie since \"GIGLI\"",

This spoof has clever ideas, and at times it's smart, but overall it's dumb just like it's filmmakers. Marlon Wayans stars/co-writer/co-producer as Christian Black an entrepreneur. Hannah Steele (played by Kali Hawk as the Dakota Johnson role) interviews him for her roommate's school paper. No one enjoys these, Marlon Wayans is a jackass if he thinks we enjoy this crap, these filmmakers are dumb, the only reasons these films exist is because of money so dumb people can pay to see this. But it's at times it's funny and at times they make some clever jokes unlike the \"Haunted House\" franchise. But overall it gave me a few chuckles, and I did enjoy some of the jokes and scenes. And I did enjoy some of the scene it's spoofing. 3 out of 5 stars",
