Based on the unbelievably true life stories of three of these women, known as \"human computers\", we follow these women as they quickly rose the ranks of NASA alongside many of history's greatest minds specifically tasked with calculating the momentous launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit, and guaranteeing his safe return. Dorothy Vaughn, Mary Jackson, and Katherine Johnson crossed all gender, race, and professional lines while their brilliance and desire to dream big, beyond anything ever accomplished before by the human race, firmly cemented them in U.S. history as true American heroes.

    "critic_reviews": [
        "Hidden Figures, both a dazzling piece of entertainment and a window into history, bucks the trend of the boring-math-guy movie.",
        "This bracing movie...gets off to a spirited start and rarely lets up, sharing with viewers a little-known chapter of history as inspiring as it is intriguing.",
        "The film\u2019s made with more heart than art and more skill than subtlety, and it works primarily because of the women that it portrays and the actresses who portray them. Best of all, you come out of the movie knowing who Katherine Johnson and Dorothy Vaughn and Mary Jackson are, and so do your daughters and sons.",
        "Feels utterly fresh for our times.",
        "Lots of movies are labeled as \"inspirational\" \u2013 Hidden Figures truly earns the right to the term.",
        "The film's big breakout is Mon\u00e1e, the Grammy-winning musician who impressed in a small role in Moonlight but showcases a wealth of talent as the youngest and most opinionated of the three main women.",
        "You might just find yourself applauding during certain moments of dramatic triumph in Theodore Melfi\u2019s unabashedly sentimental and wonderfully inspirational film, and yes, some of those moments feature people working out high-level math problems.",
        "This is one of the year's best films.",
        "A triumphant and heartwarming film, not an angry and scolding one, that carefully maps how excellence and determination win over the doubters.",
        "Hidden Figures might not be as groundbreaking as the women whose story drives it, but like those women, it does what it does very well.",
        "Charged with streamlining Figures\u2019 knotty real-life histories, director Theodore Melfi (St. Vincent) tends to paint too much in the broad, amiable strokes of a triumph-of-the-week TV movie. But even his earthbound execution can\u2019t dim the sheer magnetic pull of an extraordinary story.",
        "It's a lesson that African-American culture offers more inspiring stories than Hollywood has chosen to tell.",
        "Taraji P. Henson excels in a heart-warming history lesson that proves not only rocket men had The Right Stuff.",
        "Directed with what you might call resounding competence by Theodore Melfi, Hidden Figures isn\u2019t pushing the cinematic boat out in any new directions, but it steers its prescribed course nimbly and nicely.",
        "Essentially Parabolas & Prejudice, it isn\u2019t the most nuanced piece of work out this month. But nuance be damned \u2014 an uplifting plea for equality, this is a story calibrated for maximum effect.",
        "When executed with love and peopled with actors who breathe life into their characters, Hidden Figures is precisely the delight it aims to be.",
        "A crucial episode of the nineteen-sixties, centered on both the space race and the civil-rights struggle, comes to light in this energetic and impassioned drama.",
        "The film may not be restrained but stars Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Mon\u00e1e are powerfully effective and its little-known true story is so flabbergasting that resistance is all but futile.",
        "From one scene to the next, you may know more or less what is coming, but it is never less than delightful to watch these actors at work.",
        "Hidden Figures is a bouncy, almost garish feelgood girl pic. A movie that knows right from wrong and doesn\u2019t see any use in complicating matters.",
        "While Hidden Figures hits many of the beats one would expect, Melfi\u2019s film strikes a delicate balance of injecting levity within the character-based historical drama that propels the story forward.",
        "While Hidden Figures is likable and illuminating, it is, nevertheless, routine and predictable.",
        "It\u2019s candied history. The timeline is all wrong, the soundtrack is too cheery, the movie is too eager to please. Yet at the end, I found myself tearing up anyway.",
        "The story that Hidden Figures tells is so irresistible that you can almost forgive the fact that the movie itself is resistibly unoriginal. It\u2019s an unabashed crowd-pleaser with a heavy history lesson undertow.",
        "Hidden Figures is an admirable attempt to dramatize an overlooked aspect of American history. Working from a screenplay that he co-wrote with Allison Schroeder, director Theodore Melfi (\u201cSt. Vincent\u201d) delivers a crowd-pleasing film that often resembles a sitcom but frankly addresses the social inequities of the period.",
        "The movie indicts exclusion and racial hierarchy without finding villains inside that system.",
        "Historical fudges aside, Hidden Figures provides an example of determination and talent triumphing over an unfair and repressive system.",
        "For all that it tells a highly unusual story, Hidden Figures is a classic Hollywood feel-good movie. This has been a year of notable achievement for African-American performers and stories, from the surprising observations about masculinity in Moonlight to the gently told civil-rights saga of Loving. In that sober-sided company, Hidden Figures is a face-licking puppy dog of a film.",
        "Its positive message about education, the value of hard work, and the power of social commitment make it a must-see for parents and kids alike.",
        "It is old-fashioned in a good way, classical and well-acted, and that it has no surprises keeps it from being disappointing, even as it keeps it from being great.",
        "A paean to the unsung, Hidden Figures is also a romanticized tribute to everyday problem solvers who, in the movie\u2019s eyes, are their own kind of superheroes.",
        "Hidden Figures is feel-good history, but it works, and it works on behalf of heroes from a cinematically under-served community. These smart accomplished women had the right stuff, and so does this movie.",
        "Hidden Figures, directed by Theodore Melfi (St. Vincent), is a canny and necessary crowd-pleaser in which not one moment feels like life itself. But, together, in their superb Hollywood falseness, they accrete into a portrait of our best idea of our national character while still exposing bitter truths about who was allowed to be what back in that age of presumed \"greatness.\"",
        "The fine, spirited work of Taraji P. Henson, Spencer and Janelle Monae as irresistible rooting interests, as well as Kevin Costner\u2019s winningly lived-in turn as the head of Langley\u2019s Space Task Group, deepen a film that\u2019s propelled by sitcommy beats and expository dialogue.",
        "Hidden Figures is empowerment cinema at its most populist, and one only wishes that the film had existed at the time it depicts \u2014 though ongoing racial tensions and gender double-standards suggest that perhaps we haven\u2019t come such a long way, baby.",
        "A fairly entertaining gloss of a docudrama elevated by its cast.",
        "Warm and witty performances by Spencer, Hensen and Monae, the stoic moral stature Costner plays and unlikable-until-they\u2019re-reasonable turns by Dunst and Parsons make Hidden Figures a winner, a piece of unknown history rendered flesh and blood funny, uplifting and never less than entertaining.",
        "The central characters' dogged refusal to cede their places on a team that keeps trying to reject them is a moving display of heroism.",
        "This is heartfelt, inspiring stuff and there is no doubt that this is a true story that absolutely merits wider recognition.",
        "The tone is earnest, with dialogue that sometimes plods when you want it to fly \u2014 a running time of 127 minutes doesn\u2019t help the pacing \u2014 and a couple of pieces of casting are infelicitous: Jim Parsons gives a flat performance as the fictional Paul Stafford, NASA\u2019s lead engineer, and Glen Powell is years too young to play John Glenn, who looks like a gung-ho frat boy.",
        "Just as importantly, though, is the tone of Melfi's film...which blends humor and emotion into the proceedings, to heartwarming effect.",
        "The film aims for the stars but might have gone stratospheric if it cooled its jets ever so slightly.",
        "Everything in Hidden Figures is smoothly efficient but also a little anticlimactic and frictionless \u2014 the story\u2019s happy ending a little too easily achieved.",
        "Hidden Figures is an earnest movie, but not a very exciting one. The screenplay feels as engineered as a Gemini rocket launch, with every scene and line carefully calculated.",
        "For all of its current touchstones, Hidden Figures feels far too late, both in the recognition these women deserve and the filmmakers\u2019 goodhearted but dull approach to their stories.",
        "At a time when calls for diverse media dominate the industry, Hidden Figures hedges its bets with a family-friendly commercial solution: warm and fuzzy storytelling that\u2019s both progressive and safe.",
        "Hidden Figures is a nice movie. At its head is a trio of good performances from Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae. But it is in essence a feature-length version of an inspiring social media image macro, or perhaps a Google Doodle. \u201cDid you know that black women were important at NASA?\u201d It has little else to offer."

Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae all give fine performances as the titular characters, as do Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Mahershala Ali, Jim Parsons, etc in supporting roles, but they simply can't help the film feel like nothing more than a predictable narrative and formula we've seen too many times before. I also honestly found the overall film, the score/music choice in particular very corny. Overall, it's definitely a feel-good film with an inspiring true story with some dedicated performances from great actors and actresses, but don't go in expecting anything extraordinary in terms of the inspiring true story subgenre.",

And yes it does go for undeniably great benchmark films too.  This picture falls squarely into the second category.  All the players are good.  Costner seems perfect for his part.  It's a nice movie about race in America during the sixties and the space race that was of the same period.  It blends the two subjects perfectly.",

You're mostly just checking and double-checking math results that an early (hence somewhat unreliable) computer spit out.Frankly movies like this do blacks a grave disservice, just like that one about the African \"math genius\" who in reality is a mediocre club-level player who peaked at age 19 and only won awards through affirmative action.

The script has the good fortune of facts telling a story of the epic struggle of educated blacks to be accepted at NASA against the backdrop of more facts, the epic courage of the early American astronauts and NASA administrators.  The high point for me occurs when Kevin Costner takes a metal crowbar to the sign \"Colored's Bathroom\" with 15 colored women, the \"computers\" watching.  Wow.  Priceless mythmaking of the highest order, small personal acts of courage and justice demonstrating and highlighting more truly human values than the norms of mainstream culture.

Today we talk about discrimination against women, though this film is an example that it all had started way long ago, yet the struggle has not ended. Anyway, this is a biopic, a biopic of three women and their struggle not just being a black, but being women. When the nation was eager to send its first man to the space, there was some trouble within the team who are behind it to work together as one. Lots of inspiring events reveal how the history was made and the working culture was changed forever inside the NASA.The film was nominated for the Oscars in the three slots, but did not win any. That's fine, because I would prefer those real women to be recognised over what this film had achieved. All the three actresses were good. Their roles were unique from one another. Really a wonder film about three real persons in one film. Something rare in films to highlight their achievements equally. The personal life, as well as their professional was well briefed.The others like Kevin and Dunst in small part were also good. Directed by just a one film old filmmaker. He did good. The screenplay was adapted from the book of the same name. Deserved all the awards and praises it had received. After seeing how it had ended, a sequel could be possible. Mission Moon. I hope they would consider it! Seems a nice idea!8/10",

Hensen was very good, but I'm not disappointed she didn't receive a best actress nomination. Janelle Monae was fine, but I still want her in more movies to see if she has a bit more range. I'm surprised Octavia Spencer was nominated for supporting actress, and she didn't even really do anything. She didn't have much of an Oscar scene and a very limited role in the entire film. I wouldn't say Monae deserves the nomination over her though, as Hensen was the main focus and had the largest role. Kevin Costner was a good pick for his role, and Jim Parsons was good. He basically acted like a calmer, less-funny, racist Sheldon from Big Bang Theory, but he was convincing enough. Plot: The movie is pretty by-the-numbers, not doing much to stand out. A movie like Jackie would definitely stay in my head longer than Hidden Figures. The cinematography is fine, the screenplay is fine; almost everything in this movie is simply \"fine.\" They didn't do anything wrong throughout, but nothing really new happened. I was afraid it would feel like a TV movie, as the trailers depicted it. At times it felt a bit reminiscent of a TV movie, but it definitely felt like a real, best-picture nomination deserving movie.Overall, Hidden Figures is a relatively simple movie that is worth your time, but don't expect it to be talked about or remembered too clearly in a few years.",

I have waited a few days to write a review since I watched it mostly because I knew I would write a book if I didn\u2019t. This movie touched me in so many ways, and it made me feel like I could touch the moon. Being a woman in the business world, even today there are struggles we face, I couldn\u2019t imagine having been an African American woman in the 60\u2019s trying to get to the top. From the cast to the movie itself, everything was stellar, and probably the best movie I will see all year.The story centers around Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson; three African American women working at NASA, all with dreams of their own. Katherine is an amazing mathematician, Dorothy has dreams of being a supervisor, and Mary wants to be an engineer. Individually, they face seemingly impossible stepping stones in order to get to where they want to be. One by one, they start to see their dreams unfold before their eyes, all while watching the world change around them.I found myself relating so much to Taraji P. Henson\u2019s character so much. With my profound love for math, I know what it feels like to be a woman in a man\u2019s world, the story touched me and made me have a different level of respect for this woman. Janelle Monae\u2019s character Mary was a driven woman who would do whatever it took to reach her dream. She went before the court and had the most inspiring quote of the whole movie, which is the quote I used at the beginning of my review. We all know Octavia Simpson only plays characters who are as strong and beautiful as she is, her story touched me mostly because she never gave up, and she never let failure or a hard road dampen her dreams. These women are all someone I think we can aspire to be.The rest of the cast included Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons, Glen Powell, and so many more amazing actors. They all give stellar performances. The entire cast couldn\u2019t have been chosen better. The film stuck to the original story and the facts very well, which I appreciated. It\u2019s always good to enjoy a film, and learn a little bit about history as well. There\u2019s just something about a movie that makes you feel good and knowing that it\u2019s all true. It gives you hope that the world isn\u2019t as bad as you think it is.I know I didn\u2019t go too deep into the story with this one, but its all facts. You can read the book, you can look it up. Just know that this movie will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you feel good, and it will give you hope. It\u2019s a movie you can take the whole family to. I promise you won\u2019t regret seeing this, and even if you have to pat $15, its worth it. If for nothing else, the acting is the best you\u2019ll see in a film all year.",

Lord, thank you for blessing the world with Janelle Monae and her wide range of talents. For convincing her to act and pursue a careerLord, let us give thanks for the miracle you have given us in your infinite wisdom, generosity, and mercy. Lord, thank you for blessing the world with Janelle Monae and her wide range of talents. For convincing her to act and pursue a career in Hollywood, we are unworthy of your bounty Lord, for we are but simple sinners, doomed to be imperfect. Yet, you have graced us with the sole being of perfection among us and for that, we are eternally grateful. Amen.Aside from Monae though, Hidden Figures is a pretty simple story. Telling the real life story of the black women who helped to put a man in orbit and land on the moon, it is an inspirational feel good story that is by-the-numbers. Shoving the story of these women into the feel good biopic cliches, Hidden Figures loses some of its impact as a result. Fortunately, feel good movies are always going to leave you with a goofy smile on your face after watching it and Hidden Figures fits the bill there. That said, do not expect it to be different from any other inspirational biopic you have ever seen.Blending in some light comedy to brighten the racial tensions of the story, the film actually does a solid job showing the racism the girls face working for NASA. The film really defines the racism in looks with the girls being stared down upon entering any room. Co-workers assume they cannot handle the work, only to be shown that they can. Yet, first impressions often define treatment and the women of Hidden Figures are never treated perfectly by co-workers. That said, as a PG-rated move, there are n-bombs here, which leaves the film to resort to subtle racism. Honestly, this works better for a film of this type as, by 1961, the tides were turning enough to force people to not be so overt and brash with their racism in the workplace. Hidden Figures really captures this with things still labeled as being for \"coloreds\" or the girls being excluded even when they should be filled in on the information. The film takes the same approach to sexism with people expressing obvious sexist thoughts that they are taken aback to learn are sexist. Towards the end of the film, Vivian Mitchell (Kirsten Dunst) tells Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) that she is not racist to which Dorothy tells her that she believes she thinks that is true about her, highlighting the subtly of the film with racism and sexist thoughts. The film clearly tries to bring them to the surface and does, but the racist and sexist actions of characters in the film are often done simply because it was the way things were and colored people or women doing these things was completely unprecedented.However, while the film largely handles the racism elements over it, it cannot help but burst into bombastic monologues about the ills of racism and the importance of overcoming it. These monologues are largely done by Katharine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) and Al Harrison (Kevin Costner). The director of the Space Task Group, Harrison lets the racism occur until Katharine informs him about it, at which point he puts an end to it. Clearly seen as a white savior of sorts for Katharine in particular, Harrison repeatedly makes large displays of inclusion, yet still excludes Katharine and kicks her out at the request of his superiors, in spite of her talents. He makes the most attempts of anybody to include her, but clearly does so begrudgingly. This does not stop the film, however, from using his character as a white savior to lend a helping hand to the disenfranchised among us. Returning to the original purpose of this paragraph, the film may do a good job at crafting the air of racism and sexism around of every turn. However, it lacks the subtly in its dialogue given to its black characters to really pull it off. As a result, the film plays out with Katharine just telling people off left and right. While she is correct and free to express her thoughts, it feels to in your face and overt. Maybe she was like, I do not know, but as a film, there are ways to show her fight back and prove them wrong without having to jump up in their face to do so.Of course, these emotional monologues only further serve to make the film feel conventional. What good is a feel good and inspirational film without moving speeches by the oppressed? Regardless of whether the real women were like this, the characters in the film are pigeon holed into a palatable package that will not offend white people like slave dramas often do. Instead, these stock characters allow white audiences to largely look past their race and have a good time anyways, even if all the white characters are portrayed as the evildoers they potentially were to some degree. That said, the rise, the breakthrough, the challenge at the end, the fall, and then the final ascension to praise, are all tried and true inspirational feel good biopic cliches. Director Theodore Melfi ensures that this film hits each beat on the nose.",

Maybe there are no more Jim Crow segregation laws, but we still see Civil Rights protests by angry citizens flaunting picket signs, gender discrimination in the workforce, and consistent scientific breakthroughs from widely respected corporations. You might believe me when I say how very little has changed since then, as we are ultimately guilty of repeating the same mistakes, which the newest biopic, Hidden Figures, subtly proves to us.\u200bIt churns your stomach to remember the function of class relations in 1961: all colored people by law could only touch specially separated computers, bathrooms, and coffee stations labeled, \u201ccolored.\u201d The police also had the privilege to escort a Negro out of the library for setting foot in the \u201cWhite\u201d section. Unbelievably, these rules to living were active not too long ago. Yet these circumstances allow the delivery of an uplifting true story about man\u2019s historical progression and future potential.Three ladies of color are seen beside a nonfunctioning car in the Virginia countryside. So who else would come to ruin their day other than a stubborn police officer? It looks like a deep pit of doom until they suddenly get the car functioning again, and successfully convince the officer to escort them to their jobs at  NASA.One is sent to the other \u201ccolored\u201d workers in a separate room from the rest of the campus, one is left to work in the testing facility where the other men bully her, and one gets the worst of it\u2014she spends day and night working behind a desk, ruthlessly mistreated by everybody else. Her incredible knowledge in analytical geometry makes little difference; she still gets deliberately discriminated by her coworkers, and has no other options other than to race half a mile across campus to the nearest \u201ccolored\u201d bathroom whenever she needs to relieve herself.The cast and crew\u2019s hard work results in a loyal adaptation, both to the true story and to the Margot Lee Shetterly book it\u2019s based on. Educational facilities everywhere will benefit from its survey of the cultural influence on NASA during its early efforts of launching man into space. If that\u2019s not a landmark event in societal progression worth telling, then I don\u2019t know what is.Although beside the meticulous recreation of the Civil Rights era\u2019s segregation, the overall period setting offers nothing new to the cinematic experience. Director Theodore Melfi\u2019s direction brims in the epitome of generic: creating too squeaky-clean of an atmosphere in order to be the sole \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d Oscar buzz movie. The bright colors and made-for-television sets do not recreate the sickening feel of the era it attempts to establish. Although the period does get needed justice by showing a series of news footage from the time, the slightly-off-focus cinematography fails to craft the feel of immersion.The shifts in tone and character may feel a bit too sudden to produce any further realism in the environment, the overwhelmingly masculine society triggers a series of intriguing tests onto the three women. At home, one of them must act as both mommy and daddy to her three daughters, adding to her already boiling pressure. The challenges on and off the job never seem to quit, and the remarkable chemistry between the three leading ladies: Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e, halt any dull moments. Henson particularly deserves special recognition in her portrayal of an independent woman we want to succeed; her transparent discomfort comes across as all the White workers stop and stare at the color of her skin.While a picture about the Civil Rights era probably didn\u2019t need to dwindle its content down to a profitable PG-rating, the job still triumphs based on the difficult subject the cast and crew had to handle. In light of recent memories we have succumbed to throughout 2016, all of us: man and woman, dark or light, millennial and baby boomer, ought to use a high quality feel-good drama to look toward a brighter 2017.",

Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae), whose work at the US Space Agency, NASA contributed significantly, to the success of America's space programme. The movie documents the struggles Johnson, Vaughan and Jackson had to go through in segregated America, compounded by discrimination against women, to get ahead in their chosen fields; Johnson, with a special mathematical talent, Vaughan with computing know-how and Jackson, a mathematician aspiring to be an Engineer. The story largely centres on Katherine Goble Johnson but Taraji P. Henson's portrayal does not quite drive the movie, only picking up at two points, when her character dramatically confronts Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) her boss at the NASA Division where she works, over segregation and a particularly symphonic scene where she engages in solving a complex mathematical problem on a chalk board. It is three members of the supporting cast that keep this movie humming along very nicely, for its duration; Costner who puts in an effortless performance as Al Harrison, director of the Space Task Group assigned the responsibility of putting a man into orbit, Janelle Monae who deserves applause for her virtuoso performance as Mary Jackson and Academy Award Winner, Octavia Spencer (The Help), present as a reassuring, steadying hand. This is a beautifully filmed movie with an engaging story.",

The film takes place in months leading up to John Glenn (played by Glen Powell) who figures importantly in this film aside from being an astronaut and racism is still ingrained in the American consciousness. The latter is shown in small and large ways, each effective, whether it is a woman having to run a half a mile to go to the 'colored women's bathroom\" even though she is capable and does help NASA solve many problems to get men in orbit around the world and get them back safely.Taraji P. Henson is real life Katherine Goble Johnson, a mathematical genius, who knows 'her place' and is insulted not only by words but by actions. She is only one woman of two in an office of a dozen men and she is Black having to put up with some indignities to do a job she loves, wants to keep, but when she reaches a point that she has had enough she is not afraid to open her mouth.The other woman in the office, the group's executive assistant played by Kimberly is not welcoming and the head engineer, played by Jim Parsons, first has no respect for Katherine and then disdain only to question the knowledge she gives that is more accurate than his. The only one who doesn't care about her sex or color but her much needed knowledge is her boss Al Harrison, played believably by Kevin Costner.There are other people in Katherine's life aside from her 3 children whose husband/father is dead, her mother and, about half way through, a very romantic army officer Mahershala Ali but two others, her best friends, also faces racism because of being Black, though very smart accomplished women. Dorothy Vaughan, played by a strong Octavia Spencer, is in charge of the West Computing Group, as they are referred to, made up of Black women which segregates them from the White women in the East Computing Group. She does the work and puts in the time that a supervisor does but she isn't given the title and certainly not the pay. She delivers a put down with a smile that hides her pain but tells the truth.The third woman is Mary Jackson, played by a saucy, smart Janelle Monae, who wants to be an engineer but, due to Virginia laws, is not allowed to attend the classes she needs to get the degree. (Ah Virginia, the State that is also the basis for the movie \"Loving\" and tells  another true story about that State's laws.) She has a husband, played by Aldis Hodge, who hesitates in backing her but has a Polish-Jewish refugee, played by Olek Krupa, from the concentration camps, who is all for her going for her dream.Based on the nonfiction book by Margot Lee Shetterly one doesn't know how much of the script by Schroeder and Melfi was \"Hollywoodized\" but a lot of it rings true and the production designs by Wynn Thomas and the costumes designed by Renee Ehrlich Kalfus certainly reflect the era.The acting by all is first rate but Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae give powerful performances showing how strong and accomplished Katherine, Dorothy and Mary were, the indignities they suffered and how just by being themselves they are role models for all of us.\"Hidden Figures\" has two story lines intertwined and as exciting as the race to the moon became the true story of what these three smart women had to go through because of their color was more interesting as the former was familiar to me while the latter was a learning experience about these women I knew nothing about and everyone should.",

This movie is not some boring documentary on NASA that you show on a rainy day in elementary school, it's a power important movie that I strongly suggest seeing. Starting off with the acting, we have great performances by Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monae, and Octavia Spencer. The bond between these ladies feels so authentic and real.. It really felt like they were good friends who've known each other for years. We also have the plot, which without spoiling is about African American Women who did phenomenal work at NASA but were not given the credit they deserve due to the color of their skin. It's a sad thing to watch because you just want them to get awarded for their amazing work and you can't help but root for these ladies. There are really nice moments in this movie that make you want to cheer, but some that make you want to boo and cry. It's so sad to think that this type of injustice was so regular back just a few decades ago. It not only tackles racism but also sexism, these ladies were not only mistreated for their skin but also for their gender. You just can't help but wish the best for these ladies and I really loved rooting for them throughout the film. The only thing that I have to say negatively about this film is the backstory of the ladies could be a bit more shown. I would of liked to see a little less scenes of the equations and a little more of the main character's, Katherine Johnson, Love Life and kids, as well as the other ladies a bit more. I would like to see or learn how they really became good friends and why those 3 in particular became so close. This is not a movie that you show on a rainy day in science class, this is a remarkable film that you should take your kids to go see right now to teach them the lesson of equal treatment and how to award people no matter what gender or skin color they are.",

Henson,  Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monde portraying three African American ladies  of unusual skills and talent who became indispensable computer-members of the team that helped bring our country into the space age and, in particular, the safe orbit and return of Astronaut John Glenn. Also starring Kevin Costner, the film is based on the book by Margo Lee Shetterly with a noteworthy screenplay co-written by director Theodore Melfi and Allison Schroeder. This movie describes the abuses and mental hardships that these ladies had to undergo, endure and ultimately overcome while tending to the task of aiding their country in its time of need. Set in the early 1960\u2019s against the background of Reverend King and the others who were fighting for civil rights, the film brings home the plight of this victimized minority when even using a coffeemaker or restroom in the NASA compound became an issue. Yet, throughout all of these indignities and humiliations, these women persevered and performed above and beyond all expectations even surpassing at times the supposedly talented white engineers and the newly introduced IBM computer that NASA was so heavily relying upon. Perhaps the view of two elderly African American ladies with their young granddaughters sitting in the row in front of me in the theater made me realize how significant and important this film is because it showed us all, including those little girls seated in front of me, how tenacity, talent and dignity can conquer adversity and help those with such qualities achieve the accolades and acknowledgments properly due them.   When one sees a film about the Holocaust, the question often arises as to how many great minds were lost in this mass horror. This film, in its own way, likewise poses the question as to how many great minds were lost or forsaken in the name of prejudice and hate. I recommend this film to persons of every color and gender because it is inspiring and informative and well deserving of an 8.0 rating.",

It was during this time of social unrest, social inequality for the black community, and for women, that Johnson helped break through the glass ceiling into the stratosphere.Hidden Figures follows the interwoven accounts of Dorothy Vaughan, played by Octavia Spencer, Mary Jackson, played by Janelle Mon\u00e1e, and Katherine Johnson, played by Taraji P. Henson \u2013 three African-American women who participated in some of NASA's greatest successes.   Johnson\u2019s work for NASA was pivotal in helping to win the space race to get man to the moon, after the US lost the race with the Soviets to get the first rocket to space and then lost again in getting the first man up there.Johnson was selected to move integration forward at the graduate programme at the then all-white West Virginia University.  Johnson taught mathematics, French, and music in public schools in Virginia, until 1952, when a family member told her about a job opening at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics at the Langley Aeronautical Laboratory.Johnson co-authored the 1960 report: Determination of Azimuth Angle at Burnout for Placing a Satellite Over a Selected Earth Position, a report containing equations describing the trajectories for placing manned mercury capsules into low-earth orbit and returning it safely to the planet's surface. This made Johnson the first credited female author in the flight division.Hidden Figures picks up story when Johnson was known as one of the \u2018computers who wear skirts\u2019, a division within N.A.S.A that calculate complicated sums, during a period of time before advanced computers. Among these problem solvers were a group of exceptionally talented African-American women, some of the brightest minds of their generation.  This didactic tale couldn\u2019t come at a more important time, with divisive political movements threatening to build walls and close borders.  Hidden Figures has an important message quoted from Kevin Costner\u2019s character, Al Harrison: \u201cA rising tide lifts all boats.\u201d Costner\u2019s character is always looking for the bigger picture: the mathematical breakthrough to give America the edge, an equation that didn\u2019t exist yet.  The answer, however, came from a formula that was always in front of them, they just couldn\u2019t see its value. Ends...",

One thing I have to mention is that this movie was NOT in wide release in Canada, so I had to find it at a different theatre than my local Cineplex.  Because I had heard so much about it, perhaps my expectations were a little too high - I was disappointed at how pedestrian it was.  Humour thrown in for the sake of humour and a romance that was completely unnecessary.  Of the Oscar contenders I saw throughout the year, it wasn't the best film, however it has momentum only because of the Trump effect.",

The film's cast gives quite weak performances, particularly Henson, who the movie seems to hold up as a much better actor than she is in reality, bar Costner and Spencer, who both give solid performances.

As African Americans, they shatter the barrier of entry to the hallowed hallsIn the arc of history you do not often see an underprivileged group shatter multiple glass ceilings. The incredibly brave women of Hidden Figures do exactly this. As African Americans, they shatter the barrier of entry to the hallowed halls of NASA, one of the crown jewels of the military industrial complex. As women they shatter the boys club of aerospace and rockets, where females were generally relegated to secretarial or clerical roles. Again as women, they shatter the upper echelons of scientific cliques, where many advanced subjects and challenges were deemed too difficult for females to undertake. This story needs to be told and retold. I literally cringed at the harsh treatment that these women faced in the bigoted time circa 1961. It seems the white establishment went out of their way to insult and humiliate their fellow African Americans, who showed amazing restraint and grace. It is quite alarming that a vast segment of America wants to return to this era, to put \u2018minorities in their place\u2019, but thankfully that clock will not be rolled back any time soon.It takes incredible courage to be the first, the pioneer and the vanguard, to pierce the veil of discrimination and shove your way into the room. The bravery of these women is exemplary and admirable through the ages. A must see movie to understand the cruelty of the past, and the possibilities born from courage and ambition. To me the historic space missions were a side story, the real subject was the journey of these strong, brave ladies of NASA.",

The story begins with a promise, our gifted protagonist shining during her childhood; that invites the viewer to believe in all the wonders embodied in these three women, which are going to be exposed. Since then, the level of edification is big enough in order to identify the spectator with the characters and their situations: racial segregation, discrimination, undervaluation, labor exploitation and more. An interesting thing is the mutualism that develops around the three women, how each other complements the next one, how they support themselves and solve their flaws. None of them could have done it without the other two. The problem with the movie is that, there is nothing more than that; is just a story, a beautiful one, but there is no much to think about it. Octavia Spencer is charming as always, but Taraji P. Henson is astonishing, the acting surprise of the film.",

You feel taken away by the excellent cast and cinematography coalesced to produce a willful movement of emotions in me that I would call true escapism. You really feel the push back of will for this trio of female characters in this segregationist culture. The male dominated workplace displays both overt and subversive racism. Occasionally jarring, moving and very engaging. Watching this reminded me of how powerful an effect a decent film production can have on an audience.",

And it can easily be filtered out from all the running sequences it executes since it could have been a bit more intense than it actually pretends to be. The narration is not only adaptive and gripping but contains layered dialogues that strikes well on your mind that highlights the entire sequence through it. If Henson; the protagonist, fails to live up to the potential of the role offered to her and mind that these are big shoes to be filled, she is blessed with an incredible supporting cast that helps elevate the momentum in each frame. No matter how stereotypical Costner's character gets, he still delivers thoroughly and on the other hand Spencer too leaves a long lasting impression through her performance. Although, Monae, Dunst and Parsons are surprisingly not convincing enough to blend in aptly into these numbers along with a bit amateur editing and lazy background score. The theme of the tale is genuinely fascinating as the three lead characters resonates their persona with such impactful notions in the storytelling that you cannot not be moved by it. They swoop in as their savior with such subtilty that you are practically wolfish rooting for more and more. And with the conflicts like such and the rivalries that anchors and holds them down, these moments glorify them itself. Melfi is undoubtedly a better writer than the director, his nature to weave out a gripping structure is much more powerful than convincingly projecting one. A tale fragile and powerful as Hidden Figures probably required better methodology and treatment in order to draw out more than a nod from the viewers, but the work that went in here is still plausible enough to explore these figures.1",
