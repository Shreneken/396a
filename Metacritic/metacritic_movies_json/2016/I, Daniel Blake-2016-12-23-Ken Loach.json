Gruff but goodhearted, Daniel Blake (Dave Johns) is a man out of time: a widowed woodworker who\u2019s never owned a computer, he lives according to his own common sense moral code. But after a heart attack leaves him unable to work and the state welfare system fails him, the stubbornly self-reliant Daniel must stand up and fight for his dignity, leading a one-man crusade for compassion that will transform the lives of a struggling single mother (Hayley Squires) and her two children.

    "critic_reviews": [
        "This is a kitchen-sink hymn for the indomitable spirit of the common man.",
        "I, Daniel Blake is one of Loach\u2019s finest films, a drama of tender devastation that tells its story with an unblinking neorealist simplicity that goes right back to the plainspoken purity of Vittorio De Sica.",
        "Loach\u2019s film isn\u2019t as stridently political as it probably sounds. These are just proud people who want to be treated with respect. There\u2019s one slightly melodramatic turn near the end that felt off, but by then I was already three tissues deep.",
        "It\u2019s often warm and quite funny, but is, at heart, a damning critique of the Tory government in Britain and their belt-tightening austerity measures, as well as a rallying cry for those who fall through the cracks.",
        "I, Daniel Blake is a dignified film containing moments of hilarity and genuine heartbreak. It's a movie dripping with social relevance and shines a light on the red tape bureaucracy that cripples those that are in most need of help.",
        "Acclaimed filmmaker Ken Loach is a master at capturing the day-to-day of British life, and this film, which won the coveted Palm D'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival, is no exception. That said, it may be easier for some to decipher the heavy British accents than others.",
        "For the iconoclastic film director Ken Loach and his longtime screenwriting collaborator Paul Laverty, I, Daniel Blake represents their most accessible film ever.",
        "It\u2019s a touching story, and a deflating one. And Johns (\u201cFishermen\u2019s Friends\u201d) makes Daniel Blake Everyman and Everywoman, stoic and hard-working, overwhelmed by a system that\u2019s been rigged to prevent claims, to make the \u201csafety net\u201d not all that safe at all.",
        "I, Daniel Blake, a new Loach landmark which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last year, sums up everything that has kept he muckraking motor running for decades.",
        "I, Daniel Blake is one of his better efforts because the story is powerfully focused and the acting is strong, which is not always the case with Loach's films.",
        "The emotional wallop grows more zealous with almost every sequence, and Loach\u2019s refusal to go easy on us is as stubborn as it was when he made \u201cCathy Come Home.\u201d",
        "Johns makes it all bearable. Inviting, even. His performance has such a gentle humanity, especially in the darkest scenes, that you can\u2019t turn away. You don\u2019t just root against the system. You root for him, and that\u2019s an important distinction.",
        "What makes the pain of this film bearable is Daniel\u2019s unquenchable decency, courage and perseverance.",
        "When the system is rigged, trying to do the right thing wears a man down.",
        "A couple of scenes are perhaps too on the nose, but the naturalistic performances are faultless, the righteous anger controlled, and the bleakness dotted with moments of humour and small acts of kindness. I, Daniel Blake is, first and foremost, a deeply humanistic film.",
        "It's a spare film, muted in colour and unflashy \u2013 and it's all the more powerful and urgent for it.",
        "Loach scans the contemporary landscape, and instead of a firebrand approach of stereotype, delivers a film of immense sadness. Someone should project this on the walls of the Department for Work and Pensions.",
        "Following the disappointing period dalliance of Jimmy's Hall, Ken Loach's latest I, Daniel Blake is something of a return to form. It stands as a succinct and furious raging against the dying of the light, or more accurately the snuffing of the light by a privatised and punitive system more intent on lowering the figures than caring for those in need.",
        "The story is told with stark and fierce plainness: unadorned, unapologetic, even unevolved. Loach\u2019s movie offends against the tacitly accepted rules of sophisticated good taste: subtlety, irony and indirection.",
        "The film is anchored by incisive characterizations rich in integrity and heart, and by an urgent simplicity in its storytelling that's surprisingly powerful.",
        "Whichever side you come down on, Johns\u2019 and Squires\u2019 low-key performances are impressive (Johns won Best Actor at this year\u2019s Seattle International Film Festival), and the technological/red-tape hurdles their characters face feel stingingly accurate.",
        "I, Daniel Blake is about human value: disposable and abstract in one context; eternal, inviolable and sacred in another. They might underline the point a bit too thickly, but Loach and Laverty count on their audience to discern the difference, and to act accordingly.",
        "Johns is terrific, the heart and soul of the movie, playing the kind of guy that\u2019s the heart and soul of any industrialized country on the planet.",
        "It's a touching story that would seem altogether familiar if weren't also loaded with urgency.",
        "The biggest lesson to take away from I, Daniel Blake is how a movie doesn\u2019t have to be psychologically complex or cinematically dazzling to dig beyond its surface. It\u2019s rudimentary in terms of technique, but how the film generates its power is through the themes of humanity and kindness at its center.",
        "When I, Daniel Blake regrettably piles it on at the end, it\u2019s Loach growing weary of humanizing details and desperate to shake you up with consequences, didacticism and speechifying. It\u2019s the finger-pointer in him, but as this movie frequently shows in its best moments, he\u2019s still a practiced veteran at open-arms affection for the dignity of the downtrodden.",
        "While it might not break new ground, there is no denying the potency of the film\u2019s empathetic anguish and fury.",
        "The movie is plenty affecting when it sticks to credible, low-key difficulties faced with weary decency; there was no need to crank the pathos up to 11 and throw a full-scale pity party.",
        "Ultimately this political film\u2019s sentimentality and transparency detract from its power.",
        "With I, Daniel Blake, Loach is using the medium for one of its most crucial purposes: to shine a light on injustices he sees all around him, as well as on our capacity for human decency.",
        "While it too often sands the complications off what you sense should feel like an uncomfortably splintery issue, in its best moments, it\u2019s a quietly fearsome piece of drama.",
        "It's pock-marked by the conservative dramatic conventions and broad political gestures that have marred much of Ken Loach's recent output."

It is a battle-cry for common decency that yearns for open ears and absorbent hearts, lifting you by the collar and catapulting you into Loach\u2019s formidable neorealist world of unjust societal issues.The world in which we are immersed in is portrayed through the life of Daniel Blake, a ruthlessly determined and proud carpenter from the industrial and grey skied north-east city of Newcastle, who due to a heart condition has been forced to leave work and apply for Employment and Support Allowance.  Having been rejected by the robotic hierarchy of \u2018officials\u2019 in the Jobseekers Allowance offices, we are transported with Daniel (stand-up comedian Dave Johns) on a journey of degradation that makes you both question the government\u2019s understanding of welfare and have faith in humanity all at once.The crucially succinct narrative, written by Loach\u2019s long term collaborator Paul Laverty, is incredibly effective and acts as a main indicator between the everyday man and the overarching shadow of the state.  The monotone ramblings of the office worker in the speech orientated opening scene when asking Daniel to perform simple tasks such as raising his arm, paralleled against the at first jovial disbelief of Blake, set the tone for the rest of the film.  It is the nameless \u2018health professional\u2019 who triumphs over Daniel\u2019s confusion and inability, deeming him unfit to work and instigating the beginning of the end. Daniel\u2019s life is paired alongside that of Katie\u2019s (played by rising star Hayley Squires), a single mum of two who has travelled from the capital of soaring house prices and living costs to Newcastle with her two children Daisy and Dylan.  Our understanding of Katie\u2019s situation is demonstrated in her own struggle against the cold-blooded resistance of Sheila, the steely-eyed stone-faced office worker, who rejects any form of empathy towards the pale-skinned and harrowed Londoner.  Daniel\u2019s disbelief at witnessing the dehumanisation of such a vulnerable member of society sparks a relationship that although at first unlikely, is bonded by the need for common good and compassion in such a bleak situation.It is the intangible ambition of both Daniel and Katie respectively that makes this film so incredibly powerful.  Or perhaps it is the fact their hopes and aspirations are so brutally rejected that does it instead.  Katie talks of rebuilding the lives of her and her children, \u2018making this house a home\u2019 if it\u2019s the last thing she does and attending Open University to give her the best chance of escaping from poverty in the world\u2019s fifth wealthiest country.  Daniel\u2019s determination is portrayed through his acts of kindness, for example, by crafting a hanging fish ornament identical to the one in his own home, for Katie\u2019s daughter Daisy.  It is only Daniel\u2019s inability to overcome technological computerised form-filling techniques that counteract against his determination and ambition. For Katie, a simple broken tile that falls upon cleaning it speaks volumes of her own shattered personality.  They are aspirational, hard-working individuals seeking a fair crack of the government\u2019s relentless encroaching whip.And in no scene does this whip crack harder than when young Katie is reduced to ripping off the lid from a tin of baked beans as she finally hits rock bottom in the food bank.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been moved so bluntly by a scene in any film before.  The cinematography is impeccable, as we see a wide-angled shot of the packed shelves that raise above Katie, while she devours the pathetic tin of food. This scene, depicting a simple action that many of us take for granted every day rises above any politicised narrative and is simply about human survival rather than agenda. Left, right, centre. We\u2019re all human.This film is so intrinsic and beautifully made that I could dissect every scene and take something away from it.  There is simply no filler and the performances from both Johns and Squire are so subtly and movingly executed that it could have passed a true documentary. Every scene, every word, every whisper, every grunt, every broken Geordie and London accent needs listened to. The words leave the mouths and enter your chest before your ears with an emotional punch like no other.There\u2019s a bit of Daniel and Katie in all of us, no matter who you are or where you\u2019re from.  We just hope that we aren\u2019t the unlucky ones.",

The man beingAn unemployed man converses with an employed woman, only their voices fill up the black screen. One end clearly misunderstands the needs of her client, just like the business-minded telephone operators we know all too well. The man being berated is named Daniel Blake, and these types of meetings occur daily for him. Too long now he has sought after regular employment, yet his poor health legally prohibits him from that end goal.We all know the government\u2019s tendency to mistreat whomever struggles to attain work, a reality amplified through a megaphone by the veteran British director Ken Loach in his weepy drama, I, Daniel Blake. The UK already widely respects Loach, but for those in the US, his work deserves intense study. Every quiet image he crafts pleases the analytical eye, especially his many gorgeous compositions of Daniel walking hands in pockets through the streets. Throughout the somewhat short runtime, Loach makes you lose track of how many minutes pass by as the events tie into a complete account of a man who laughed at defeat in the face.In the first half, Daniel Blake\u2019s search offers some nice chuckles structured amongst agitation with authorities who hold back their listening ears. By the second half, Daniel\u2019s desperation handcuffs you to his ankles as he runs in circles. After surviving jingle after jingle of incompetent phone operators, Daniel\u2019s desperation leaves him furious at everyone, including a random passerby whose dog takes a dump in front of his home. Then after a chance meeting in the unemployment office, the mood starts to change. He meets a young single mother named Katie whom the specialists bully around worse than him, so Daniel channels his frustration into compassion as he offers help in her embarrassment of a home. Daniel soon lightens the mood by teaching her son and daughter how to stay warm with bubble wrap and flower pots. Now neither one of them have to individually obtain financial stability alone.Though despite the temporary positivity, things still go from worse to unbearable. The character study rings true to how job services work: Daniel learns how to use a computer, and Katie suffers a mental breakdown at a food bank. The absence of financial income gradually destroys each of their complexions; Daniel seems grow older as the film goes on; it causes you to think, \u201cWow, I have been there before. I wish I could help somehow.\u201dAt least Daniel Blake can offer one gift outside the workforce with his homemade wooden fish mobile, which he uses to inspire the children\u2019s self-worth. Yet woodcarving does not fulfill the children\u2019s miserable predicament; their tiny home of peeled wood and tile pales against the cold steel of the employment service offices. It turns you desperate as the well-fed authorities stroke their own egos.\u200bIn fact, Ken Loach presses a little too much hate toward authority by beautifying unlawful rebellion from the poor. A subplot about Daniel\u2019s Black neighbor selling counterfeit shoes contributes little to the plot, besides throwing in a last resort to gaining profit that never receives a rightful punishment. These shoes were acquired by a liaison from China, which in turn worsens the reputation of the already disrespected country. The same goes to anyone above the lower class: an excessively negative shadow casts over their poor productivity; a fair analysis finds no balance between both sides of the issue.On the other hand, Loach\u2019s piece of well-researched propaganda might very well be the wake-up call the Jobseekers Allowance needs to see our perspective of their industry. Too few jobs exist for nationwide fulfilment; the system must change.Landing a job in our present era is unimaginably hard for anyone, whether the elderly, new parents, or young adults such as myself. The journey may feel endless, we may even want to practice alternate illegal solutions. Therefore, I, Daniel Blake deserves a watch by all who suffer. Although no one should expect a typical Hollywood ending, a satisfactory solution to life\u2019s purpose as a citizen will remind you, the reader, of your power, no matter what the government expects you to think.",

Many film experts thought it would sail through, but that did not happen. Now I saw it and I think it should have made into. If the priests' dirty secrets were recognised to condemn on such a big platform, then this film deserves as well. Because it reveals the cruelty against the economically weaker families and computer illiterate old men.It is only this much short to be called a documentary film. I mean it was very realistic with cinematic dialogues, otherwise a documentary. This is a message film, highlights what's wrong with our system and who are all suffering from it. The actors were great and the 80 years- old director had done a magnificent job. You could watch as many films you want, but if you fail to watch a film like this often, there no meaning getting into film watching business.The story follows a 60 year old widower whose name mentioned in the title. As he is recovering from heart attack and as advise given by his doctor, now he's out of the job and support allowance. Whenever he approaches the officials to look his issue, they always come up with different reasons to send him back disappointing. Especially not being into the computers, he struggles to fill forms on the internet platform.He's very patience and following everything they have told him to do. One day he comes to aid to a single mother with two kids who recently moved to the city from London, when she is too struggling in the employment agency to get a job. So their relationship grows as they lend hands to one another in tough times. Following, how they recover from the issues they are facing is what the film to cover in the remaining parts.\"Listen, you know, you give me a plot of land, I can build you a house. But I've never been anywhere near a computer.\"I liked this the film, but I think it was too realistic for my kind of taste. Because I like emotional parts and in this film those parts were highly effective, but not sentimentally striking way. Maybe you can say, less music with more dramatisation changed the storytelling style. Though the focus given on economically lower class and their way of life, not intentionally, but lack of support in society, all these were well detailed. I have always supported films that point outs flaws in basic establishment in society.Almost all the major struggling juncture one goes through in the employment agency, particularly if the person was old is uncovered. Like the telephone calls responding to the recorded message, online applications, as well as meeting them in person. What we're facing right now in the world is or to know is, not everybody is a computer literate. It'll be in the future, but not now. They are not getting proper help, particularly agency treating them like the illegal immigrants.In addition the film gets more interesting when a single mother was introduced. On the other side, different issues faced by poverty ridden small family, particularly her desperate attempt to fulfill the basic needs of her children is heartbreaking. This is not just the English problem, but everywhere else in the world. It had won several awards, particularly one BAFTA award. A good film for everyone, only if you understand the notion of the film or else will be a boring film.While I was watching it, I thought it was a regular kind drama, so I kept expecting that things would turn this and that way. For almost the entire film, but it's only in the final stage something it came up with to surprise me. So my advice is keep low expectation and be patience. More importantly accept what it reveals than what you want from it. If you fail on that, then its not your film and to know that the only way is to watch it.7\u00bd/10",
