    "critic_reviews": [
        "Not quite magnificent but certainly Fuqua\u2019s best since \"Training Day\" and a rare remake that actually delivers. Yee-haw!",
        "If Fuqua and his screenwriters (including True Detective\u2019s Nic Pizzolatto) slightly botch the underlying theme of redemption\u2014Ethan Hawke\u2019s haunted ex-Confederate sharpshooter could have been more developed\u2014it still makes good on its ideas of community pride.",
        "Fuqua\u2019s remake is a worthy successor to the \u201960s \u201cSeven.\u201d",
        "In our post-Tarantino world, Fuqua shows remarkable restraint. The long, efficiently filmed battle doesn\u2019t douse us in blood; for once, PG-13 is the proper rating for a violent film.",
        "This entertaining and handsome-looking version of The Magnificent Seven is very much tailored to his star, right down to Washington\u2019s real-life history as a preacher\u2019s son.",
        "The new Seven isn't aiming for cinema immortality. It's two hours of hardcore, shoot-em-up pow and it's entertaining as hell.",
        "The Magnificent Seven had me smiling throughout, tapping into Saturday matinee memories without seeming entirely old-fashioned.",
        "Fuqua isn\u2019t interested in pushing the genre forward so much as respecting and updating the model accordingly. The director focuses on establishing his gang of gunslingers sturdily enough that the action becomes easy to engage with, and even get excited about.",
        "This Seven\u2019s just silly, solid entertainment: multiplex fun by numbers.",
        "Over all, this is a rousing, albeit sometimes cheesy, action-packed Western bolstered by Denzel Washington\u2019s baddest-of-the-baddasses lead performance, mostly fine supporting work, and yep, some of the most impressively choreographed extended shootout sequences in recent memory.",
        "Fuqua's film is ultimately a reminder of why the genre was once so wildly popular in the first place.",
        "Truly, The Magnificent Seven is a story of simple pleasures, and it gets the little things right.",
        "If body count is what you go to Westerns for, by all means drift into this one's corral. It's hardly magnificent, and apart from its casting it's not doing anything particularly original with its premise. But it's diverting in about the way you'd expect of a remake twice removed \u2014 call it a perfectly competent seven.",
        "Magnificent Seven has one and only true goal: It\u2019s a new Hollywood crack at good, old-timey entertainment.",
        "It\u2019s a fun movie, a nicely made Western in which bad guys get to be good guys sometimes. Maybe that should be enough, but you can\u2019t help wanting more.",
        "The marketing may try to dress it up like a prestige picture, but Magnificent Seven is a summer season thrill ride.",
        "Pure blockbuster gloss \u2013 perfectly fine for a Saturday afternoon matinee, but instantly forgettable once you\u2019ve emerged from the dark of a multiplex.",
        "It ain\u2019t Shakespeare, or even Kurosawa. But it\u2019s an acceptable remake of a western that itself was an acceptable remake of one of the greatest movies ever made. Enjoyable, even, until the last act proves how dull an overextended gun battle can get.",
        "As passably entertaining as the film is, it never surrenders to the abandon of its action, and as such never feels like it shifts out of first gear.",
        "You get enough of a sense of this place and these men \u2014 and that widow! \u2014 that it's a disappointment when, in the end, we just have to watch it all blow to hell.",
        "Struggling with tone and urgency during its recruiting phase, the film clomps along to a pedestrian drum-roll, summoning a stark, brooding edge without quite enough lift-off.",
        "The film is mindless entertainment by way of scoundrels, dynamite and honor \u2013 not quite magnificent, but \u201cThe Watchable Seven\u201d just doesn\u2019t have the same ring to it.",
        "The new movie is as moth-eaten as the serapes strewn through the 1960 film, but there\u2019s no denying the appeal of the image of Mr. Washington riding a horse, shooting a Colt and leading a posse of vigilantes to save a mostly white Western town.",
        "There\u2019s a fine line between a slowburn and dull, and this Magnificent Seven frequently finds itself on the wrong side.",
        "Traces of real history are hard to spot in Fuqua\u2019s Western, but there isn\u2019t much evidence of a real Western, either. You sense that an entire genre, far from being revitalized, is being plundered for handy tips.",
        "The picture is action-packed but mindlessly so, and it\u2019s neither light enough to work as a coltish entertainment nor smart enough to cut beyond anything but the most rote notions of masculinity.",
        "Despite a great cast and several terrific action sequences, Fuqua's film is largely forgettable.",
        "The Magnificent Seven is like a long-fused stick of dynamite: It takes forever to get interesting but does at least unleash an explosive finale.",
        "If there\u2019s a compelling reason to remake The Magnificent Seven, it can\u2019t be found in the 2016 version, a loud, cluttered, and generally disappointing production.",
        "This movie's all over the place, trying too hard to be all Westerns to all sensibilities.",
        "The Magnificent Seven is fine as far as it goes, but \u2014 especially when the familiar strains of the 1960 theme song begin wafting over the final scenes \u2014 one can\u2019t help feeling that it should have gone much further.",
        "Go in with low expectations and you might be pleasantly surprised.",
        "Only when there\u2019s an opportunity to blow things up does Fuqua seem fully engaged.\r\nAnother Western bites the dust.",
        "A sense of lethargy hangs uneasily over the lumbering new version of The Magnificent Seven. Despite its sturdy plot, seasoned director and capable cast toplined by Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt and Ethan Hawke, it arrives in a comatose state, a film unlikely to arouse passions one way or another.",
        "More importantly, copying an earlier era\u2019s empty slickness still produces only empty slickness.",
        "Neglects to provide the characters with enough background history to explain what makes them such original figures in the Old West.",
        "This \u201cSeven\u201d is more diverse, less patronizing than the famous Western it remakes. But it lacks the moral certitude and righteousness of its predecessor, a pre-Vietnam \u201cAmerica saves Paradise from a Dictator\u201d allegory.",
        "The group...make a fine crew. But the rest of the movie doesn\u2019t find enough interesting wrinkles on the old formula to merit a reboot.",
        "The sheer talent of the cast here sometimes provides enough depth to get audience members to the climactic shoot-out, and there are a few definite MVPs in terms of ensemble, but it\u2019s hard to envision this film having anywhere near the cinematic legacy of those that inspired it.",
        "Fuqua is trying for John Ford meets Sergio Leone: a funky classical sweep, with room for delirious shootouts. The trouble is that he mimics the trademarks of those directors without their \u00e9lan, and the plot that was once catchy is now rote.",
        "Except for the fact that virtually every shot, chop or stab the good guys make hits its mark to make the bad guys quickly drop like toy soldiers, the climactic showdown delivers what it needs to action-wise, leading to a satisfactory wrap-up.",
        "The performances are dedicated, but the camaraderie feels perfunctory, outside of a few ruminative exchanges between Hawke and Washington.",
        "The Magnificent Seven has the trappings of a classic Western and it hits its marks. All of Fuqua\u2019s movies hit their marks \u2014 even sadistic formula junk like \"The Equalizer.\" But there\u2019s no grandeur in its images or generosity in its soul. I don\u2019t think Fuqua ever loved Westerns. And by the time this movie ended, I\u2019d forgotten why I do.",
        "Instead of ever getting truly \"Magnificent,\" these multicultural gunslingers remain largely a meh seven.",
        "As a result, while the film is certainly intense at times, it's not some sort of Sam Pekinpah blood-fest.",
        "Slick but forgettable, Fuqua\u2019s suicide squad is a macho posse movie that could use a jab of fun. It\u2019s The Magnificent Seven, but the \u201cmagnificent\u201d is silent.",
        "Richard Wenk and Nic Pizzolatto's screenplay completely lacks the interpersonal vibrancy that a film like this needs and this is glaring given that it maintains the slow-build tension of the original.",
        "Because the roles are underwritten and the players struggle to establish a rapport, The Magnificent Seven never lets the audience feel like its along for the ride with a dynamic group of death-or-glory hombres.",
        "Ethan Hawke is appealing as a polysyllabic coward of some complexity, but Mr. Washington has been stripped of his usual verve and grace. Sometimes you can catch him going slack, like a man looking for the exit.",
        "It would be too easy to say The Magnificent Seven isn\u2019t magnificent. It\u2019s definitely not, but the film has an even more egregious quality: it\u2019s uninspired. There\u2019s no risk, no real attempts to subvert expectations, and no desire to truly give the audience something, if not entirely new, then at least surprising."

One major factor being these inhabitants are farmers not fighters, few if any have been in combat making inexperience a deadly weapon. Emma Cullens\u2019 husband was murdered by one of Bogues\u2019 gangs, along with many others in the close knit community; her and friend Teddy Q ride to a nearby town searching for anyone that can help, here they find Sam Chrisholm the bounty hunter and immediately try enlist his help in gaining control of the beloved Rose Creek again. Initially Chrisholm denies the pair until he learns that Bogue is the man responsible. The trio begins enlisting a quite diverse group of gunslingers, gamblers, a knife artist, sharpshooters, a tracker, and indian and a mexican outlaw to take down Bogues\u2019 tyranny. There is never a dull moment from inlaid jokes, smart comments, and humour to intense battles, realistic situations, and the constant terror; whether you enjoy comedies, action-packed, or straight western The Magnificent Seven is sure to please.\rEvaluation\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the start I knew The Magnificent Seven was going to be well thought out, prepared and executed movie. While some movies begin slow and gradually lead up to the plot or piece by piece put together a long drawn out story line, this one hits you straight on in the first few scenes. I personally prefer this kind of movie because I feel it grabs your attention quickly and will continue to hold your attention for longer rather than dragging out the intro. I thoroughly enjoyed The Magnificent Seven from start to finish.\r Relation to Similar Cultural Artifacts\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Magnificent Seven 2016 version is actually a remake of the 1960 version directed by John Sturges and starring Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Steve McQueen, Horst Buchholz, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, Brad Dexter, etc. While the 1960 versions is also a remake; It was reproduced based on the 1954 Samurai Seven directed by Akira Kurosawa starring Toshir\u00f4 Mifune, Takashi Shimura, and Keiko Tsushima.\r Getting Down To Business\rEntertaining 4/4\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I rated a perfect because I was wide-eyed the whole movie, was anticipating what would happen next with every new twist and turn of the plot, and I without a doubt would watch this movie again in a heartbeat. Although deemed a western, I believe The Magnificent Seven brought a new level of excitement to the table. Even when considering this movie a remake I believe the action was intriguing.\rScene Quality 3/4\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While analyzing the animation and scenes, I thought the scenes were very well thought out and decorated. The one low point in the scenes was when the church was shown after being torched; this was while Sam Chisholm rode into town. I thought the church was lacking when it came to the burnt look but other than that all else seemed well-executed.\rActors\u2019 Performance 4/4\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One huge aspect to look into is the quality of the actors and how well they play the role. Not once did I find a actor breaking character, they were believable being so heartfelt and dedicated to making the movie seem real. The level of experience in this cast was extreme looking at Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Haley Bennett being just a few of the main characters you can imagine that this crew can and will excel.\rPlot 4/4\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not once did I find myself wonder what the plot was actually supposed to be. I followed the timeline easily and not once was I confused about what the final goal was; that being the reason why I rate the plot as perfect.\rIntensity 4/4\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Magnificent Seven was nothing short of intense, with the man to man combat, western gunfights, and hidden surprises. The addition of the background soundtrack adds even more effect making the experience all the more life-like.\rThe Little Things 4/4\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While easily overlooked the small things in all movies make them all the more solid and interesting. The Magnificent Seven is not lacking here; while a major detail is the color of the horses. For each of the seven men their horses are all a different color or shade of brown. Furthermore each horse matches the riders\u2019 clothing color. Looking at Sam Chisholm dressed in all black atop a black horse, Josh Faraday clothed in a dark brown leather riding a dark brown horse, Billy Rocks rides a chestnut colored horse that matches his gun holster, Jack Hornes\u2019 vest and hat matches the brown horse he is atop, Red Harvest is masked with the same war paint his horse is, the others follow in the same pattern. I easily rate the details a 4/4 in The Magnificent Seven.\r\u00a0\rFinal Tally 23/24\rPS. THIS WAS FOR A CLASS GRADE!",

Therefore, I went into this remake pretty cold for the most part. And while I can say that it was certainly entertaining in some aspects, story-wise, it was simply lacking in this department. All of the action and shootouts are stuffed into the first and third acts of the film while the entire middle act is spent setting up the final battle and events of the third act, which I didn't appreciate very much. And like I said, while the film managed to remain pretty entertaining for the most part with the shootouts, it eventually all began to feel rather scattershot and choppy in the final battle. Acting was meh. Honestly it felt as though the actors portraying the seven titular protagonists were somewhat wasted and weren't really given their full potential (Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, etc have all certainly been and can do better.) Overall, it's not without it's fair share of fun moments and action. However, the fact that it's all crammed into the first and third acts of the film that leaves an overly long setup for the rather hollow-feeling middle act as well as the subpar performances from a solid cast with far more potential makes this one questionable. However, if anything, it also makes me feel somewhat compelled to go home and watch the original, which from what I hear unsurprisingly is supposed to be a lot better than this.",

Anyway, if you are young and have never seen the originals then this might be an ok film but honestly the bad guys were a weak point in this one. They were not intimidating nor intelligent which really brought down the story. In the original film, the village was facing an indomitable foe since it took place in a time of turmoil. The original foe did not select the village specifically rather the bad guys were more like a wave sweeping the country and that made them much more intimidating that some band of morons who follow a megalomaniac.

However, the movie itself is vastly overrated.  I defy anyone, who has never seen it, to view that movie without thinking how grossly outdated the acting, writing and directing is. Moreover, \"Seven Samurai\" lacks realism and common sense. Plus, the action scenes are some of the worse battles scenes in cinema history. The battle scenes are basically bad guys charging through the streets for a minute or two and then retreating. We barely get to see the seven samurai show their stuff. The 1960 version of \"The Magnificent Seven\", which I have seen 4 or 5 times, has an outstanding cast (Yul Brenner, Steve McQueen) and a great musical score, but this version of the story also makes no sense. It too suffers from being extremely dated. While watching the 1960 version, I kept thinking over and over, why would they all risk their lives for total strangers. The answers were never given.  Without plausible motivations, I couldn't believe what I saw on screen. Thus the 1960 version is also overrated. I think both movies are considered classics simply because they have a reputation for being classics. The 2016 version has upgraded special effects and enough action to keep the audience awake, but, just like the previous two versions, this movie lakes common sense and realism. The bad guys are some of the worse hired gunslingers in the history of American Westerns. They drop like flies. And though we eventually understand Denzel's motivation for defending the villagers, we don't quite see what motivates the other 6. The characters just weren't developed enough for us to understand who they were and why they fought. When the smoke clears and the body count is tallied, we are left with wondering \"was it all worth it?\"",

I never really everThe Magnificently Boring Seven is, well, boring. Predictable to its core, director Antoine Fuqua tries to valiantly cram every action cliche into a single film and the end result is a cliche film. Job well done, good sir. I never really ever rated Fuqua as a director. Training Day is a one off hit. Otherwise, he just directs safe, Hollywood, and bland action movies. This film is no exception with its problems only exacerbated by an iffy cast. Before I speak further on the film, I should first confess a major sin. As God is a major part of this film, I feel as though it is still pertinent. I...I...I have never seen Seven Samurai or the original The Magnificent Seven. I know. I would not like me either. Anyways, pressing on...\r The film's predictability comes from the very first shot. Throughout, the film is not just predictable because it is a remake (recall how I have never seen the originals), but also because you can sit there and just guess where each scene is going. What is worse is that the lazy writing carries onto the characters with skin deep character development at best. This development does not help to actually differentiate characters in the least. I honestly kept forgetting their names and mixing up who they are throughout the film. I knew that Red Harvest was the Native American, but I mean, that is because his name is Red Harvest. Hard to think that Denzel would be Red Harvest (I guess I should not say that, since Johnny Depp was Tonto...). Even worse from a character development standpoint is Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett). Okay, low-rent Jennifer Lawrence cannot act. She is not horrible, but I have yet to see any reason to cast her other than her resemblance to Lawrence. Yet, here, she plays a character that could have been a strong female character. Instead, her role disintegrates into being nothing more than a sexual object for us to ogle at thanks to frequent low-cut costumes and constant jokes about having sex with her and how she is pretty. The film can barely go 10 minutes without reminding us Emma's real role in the film: to be sexualized and objectified. How could I ever dream of forgetting such a key element of the film? Emma's role, in spite of the conclusion, continues to marginalized as she can never do anything for herself. Instead, she finds herself in the midst of gunfights and failing to defend herself. Rather, a man must come to her aid at every turn. What a missed opportunity here.\r Yet, as mentioned, Bennett is nothing to write home about in the acting department. The rest of the cast is equally mediocre. Denzel and Ethan Hawke are fine. Not career-best work by either, but they are okay. Chris Pratt has nothing charisma and abs going in his favor. As an actor, he is the definition of safe and bleh. That said, Byung-hun Lee and Martin Sensmeier were the real standouts. If the film was just Billy Rocks (Lee) stabbing people and throwing knives at them with Red Harvest (Sensmeier) sniping them with arrows, I would be a satisfied customer. Instead, they are bit players at best. Manuel Garcia-Rulfo is fine, though the butt of numerous offensive Mexican jokes, which further highlights the lazy writing. Finally, Vincent D'Onofrio was abysmal. It is like he had a frog caught in his throat and had to fight against said frog with all his might to utter a single line. Please spare me.\r As for the action, it is well done. The most entertaining part for sure. Yet, the in-between moments are so non-descript, slow, and shallow, it is hard to be entertained by the action. Instead, you are more-or-less relieved that film decided to try and do something again. I am a big fan of westerns (though I need to see more) and would love for a revival to happen. This film is not that revival. Instead, it just tediously moves along until Fuqua decides to let us get back to the good bits again with Denzel capping dudes left and right with his team by his side. In saying this, however, the action sequences are far too long and equally predictable, pulling out every cliche in the book (especially Pratt at the end, as well as the ending with Bennett).\r The sole positive that elevates this film to being just mediocre is the cinematography and scenery. I love gawdy shots of the country side with the sun setting. The Magnificent Seven has them in spades. Yet, the film does not stop there with beautiful long shots of cowboys riding in the distance and silhouetted cowboys against the sun in the background. The end result is truly gorgeous imagery. The peak of this imagery comes at the end of the film, however, particularly a shot of Denzel silhouetted against the bright sun to his left (in the image) as he walks out of a building. Another highlight coming shortly after that with Denzel and Bennett in the church with the light pouring in through the windows. Big pluses, really.\r As a whole, The Magnificent Seven is just really, really boring. Like, I am not a huge action guy, but damn. Nobody seems to have fun.",

But we all know the story, how it begins and how it ends, since it was the remake of the 1960 film. Actually, it was a successful remake, but not as magnificent as the original. Maybe the youngsters might like this one better.The director's favourite, Denzel Washington in one of the main characters. Not much change in the theme, except the screenplay was little altered, especially diversity in the film characters and their developments. Because nowadays that's a big issue in Hollywood cinema. So it was led by Denzel and possibly there will be a sequel like the 'Ocean's' trilogy.The people from a small mining town decides to hire men with guns to fight the villainous businessman who slaughtered their loved ones. The unusual seven men come together and form a team with a plan to defend the town. So what comes next is the battle between the good and the bad that lasts for the whole final act.The setting was completely refreshing, but slightly disappointing action sequences. All the seven characters were unique and awesome, but the film lacked the great battle scene that defines each one of them. Surely I favour it just for once watch that told from the todays imagination of the 1870s era. Feels like it should have been better, but in the end it is a satisfying film.6.5/10",

Yes I have watched the original and own it on DVD as yes I am a fan of the genre.  For me the original and this version there are a ton of differences, still I will put a positive spin on it as I didn't dislike the movie, but just thought there was a chance given the cast and the budget that this movie could have been great!!  I understand that there is a time limit, but felt like the characters weren't given their just dues in development.  I felt like the first part of the movie was boring and somewhat lackluster when it was introducing us to each member of the Magnificent Seven.  The story was set-up in the beginning as to why the seven were needed, but again didn't really give us much to go on.  Peter Sarsgaard as the villain Bartholomew Bogue was well cast and one we hated, but again he could have been developed even more into one of the best vilians of all time-another lost opportunity for me.  So many times in the movie it lost out to the original.  Still with all that said, when the fight and the action does come, it is Magnificent and entertaining in the sense that the original couldn't match due to the technology of today!  I thought the tricks and surprises to cut down the enemies was brilliant, the teaching of the townspeople how to fight was humorous too.  In the end the story gave a little more light to the characters, but still think it could have given us so much more!  All in all for those of you that haven't seen the original you will enjoy the action of this one, and Denzel Washington lives up to the billing, and does seem to enjoy his character.

And no negotiation, and as time goes by the offering is only get bitter.So, 3 weeks or else. Then, Bogue shot to death a young man, after questioning about Bogues morality when Bouge's men beat a reverend ruthlessly.The death of that young man leaves anger deep in the heart of Emma Cullen (Halley Bennet).\r Then Emma accompanied by his associate Teddy (Luke Grimes) search for a bounty hunter that she will pay with everything she got. Then she cross path with Chisolm (Denzel Washington) just after Chisolm executed a state wanted man for murder and rape, and so Emma ask for Chisolm's help. Chisolm accept the job for one reason - that he always takes high price, but never before someone ask for his service with everything they got. Then Chisolm recruits another six persons, first he recruited Faraday (Chris Pratt), a gambler drinker handsome big mouth but with excellent skills of card magic, then a sharp shooter with stress post traumatic disorder Goodnight Robicheaux a.k.a Angel of Death (Ethan Hawke),also a former Confederation along with his sidekick Billy Rocks (Byung Hun Lee), a very fast Chinese gunman, but faster and deadlier with blades (Byung Hun Lee actually a Korean actor).While Chisolm recruited a Mexican outlaw Vasques (Manuel Garcia Rulfo). After then they together recruited an ex Indian hunter, the legendary John Horne (Vincent D' Onofrio), and an Indian Comanche warrior with his noble principals, Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeir).\rChisolm didn't waste much time, he and his 6 compatriots killed 22 Bouge's best gunmen and sent the town sheriff to infom Bouge, gather the town's citizens to choose, stay and fight to death or leave. These 7 men only have 3 days to prepare the city before Bogue and his hundreds of army to rush them all.\r This is the 2nd remake of Akiro Kurosawa's \"Seven Samurai\" after John Sturges \"The Seven Magnificent\" (1960). If 1960's version is more focus to the 7 gunmen with the citizens, Fuqua's version is upgraded into a whole new level, all thanks to Pazollato and Wenk's screenplay that create the citizen's despair, but Chisolm anfd his men manage to turn the citizen's fear of Bouge into the fear of lost everything they ever dream for, lost for they pride. Pazolatto and Wenk also manage to put some humor in some parts.\r The screenplay smartly deliver us the story of a group of men that some of them with background that give them enough emotional reason to kill each other, e.g John Horne (ex Indian Hunter), Red Harvest (Indian Comanche), Faraday (his grandfather killed by Mexican gang), Vasquez (his grandfather was a member of Mexican gang that ambush Faraday's grandfather's town), but they bound together with one purpose, a noble purpose.Why?Cauze for another 5 men (beside Chisolm and Red Harvest) each of them have they own past to reconcile with, wanna make piece to their own soul before the next battle that could be their last one by take the impossible job. But off course the the last tiny element of surprise from Chisolm about his personal agenda, he has his very own personal reason why he finally take this job, that left me a question : Maybe this one flaw on this Mag7? Why? Because, why Chisolm rejected the offering from Emma, and declared that he himself is not for sale.but then he take the job when he found Emma will pay him - even all at once- with everything she got. Or maybe is just Chisolm eager to know how far would this widow go to seek righteousness or even revenge?If she would go a long the way, then Chisolm had a good reason to recruit the men he need.\r This Mag7 only give as much as a glance of each person's historical background, through their dialogues. Except for Robicheaux, this character get a little more exposed and curiousity what the hell happen to him after North and South war that make him hate himself so much after all act that he has committed during North and South war, that make him a very flimsy man.\rDenzel is really perform great his character cool bad ass, while Pratt represent enthusiasm and the spirit of this movie. Ethan Hawke (this is the 2nd time he team up with both Denzel and Fuqua) gave audiences skepticism about what will happen to this team. The rest of the cast, even didn't get portion as much as Denzel (off course, he is the man) or Ethan Hawke and Pratt - especially Martin Sensmier get the smallest portion - but they're all represent an assembled excellent marksmen (some og them have hororable dirty little secrets) to march as one into a battle for one descent good noble cause. Haley Bennet performances represent as young widow search for the last hope and an attitude to face all odds at all cost for he igdinity since her husband gunned down in coldblood by Bouge (Saargards appearance really gives the impression as the sick man). I also give credit to the cinematography that shots all gunfight scenes so perfectly, how Mauro Fiore took the angle to describe the savarage of Bouge's gold minning from distance.\r Fuqua's Mag7 is not one of classical western movie, but It's superbly done...and magnificently delivered to us, magically entertaining from beginning till end. Even though this movie might don't have what all critics wants to be as classical but still will be remembered as one of the most entertaining,enjoyable western.. Really as the quotes of the dialogues between Chisolm and Robicheaux \"What we lost in the fire, we found in the ashes\"",

The first action scene as seen in the trailer, is such a letdown, with no rhyme, reason or continuity. They throw in some corny bones of the original remake, including a few verbatim lines.\r Denzel was okay, but far from his best work. Vincent D'Onofrio is mildly amusing, very entertaining & quite likable as Jack Horne. Byung-hun Lee rocks as Billy Rocks and I would liked to have seen & heard more of/from him. Martin Sensmeier as Red Harvest was awesome but an important fight scene with him near the end, fell short & flat. The best actor/character in the film is Haley Bennett as the heroine, Emma Cullen! Funny thing is, the very best part of the film is her narration at the very end. I think it was the only time I smiled during the boringly long film which could have been done just as poorly in 90 minutes.\r Someone in the discussion boards talks about the painful PC diversity, and I would normally agree, but in this case, it actually worked and made a terrible film, a little more interesting. The commenter quips that only a little person was missing, but there actually is one and chose him to mock on several occasions. I guess little people aren't high on the SJW's list of victim class.\r I had to see it but would much rather have seen The Hateful Eight again instead and even went back and gave that movie an extra star. The Magnificent Seven needed the Tarantino touch and some blood. For all the killing, I don't remember seeing a drop, though maybe I just blinked through them. Then again, They can get a pass because there wasn't much blood used in old time westerns and they probably saved millions on spectacular special effects, or the lack thereof.\r This movie is SO bad, that I did something I never do at the movies, got up & went to the bathroom to be comfortable in my boredom, without even asking my friend what I missed, because I didn't care. I didn't really bond with the characters, except my concern for the horses, imagining as I always do in movies, the suffering these poor creatures went through during times of war & battle.\r This expensive movie will make money on the back of the original remake, and I'm sure they paid a fortune for the right to butcher it. I'd really like to know exactly what they did pay for the rights.\r I recommend you wait until it's on cable and have 2+ hours to waste.",

The film is held back by a really weak villain and a second half that really doesn\u2019t match the tone of the first.

The first half is genuinely fun and I did enjoy myself watching the film but I am not sure I can entirely recommend it, I don\u2019t think there is enough for fans of the old film to latch on to and I think they will be disappointed by the newer elements bought into the film and I don\u2019t think a younger audience will connect with it as the producers want them to.

First of all, just go see the original and anyone who does will immediately come to their senses with little of no effort and understand without explanation how good a Western can be. You will probably watch it twice as I have seen it maybe 30 times. That is where the word \"magnificent\" belongs and not in this remake in any way. Mass random shootings & killings with might makes right is not suspense or good story-telling. This movie came across as hollow and plastic for script, acting and plot. This is movie is like a video game of some sort where you get to pick a character and then kill as many people as you can. Mindless in presentation, severe lack of character development, egotistical parading of look at me I am in a Western and riding a horse and shooting guns is more of a display of embarrassment that I had for all the people in this movie. Here's an interesting thought. Why didn't all these folks just get together and make a movie any movie? Calling this a remake? I am surprised that critics are not all over this and telling the truth about how bad it is. Methinks the fix is in. All I can say is that if anyone likes this type of Western portrayed here, in this way and style, The Western as we know it is doomed at least for this generation.

Then suddenly, the villain enters, his menacing footsteps thump and creak on the wood floor, disagreement ensues, and suddenly, a shot splits the air. Such a startling sound, that you never really get used to, despite the amount of lead that flies here. The Western atmosphere is perfectly recreated and though it is that much more real, due to improved technology, it feels familiar in a way. Strains, variations, and melodic teases of Elmer Bernstein's famous score riddle the film and keep the mood adventurous.\r The obvious dominant component of the film, its action scenes are epic, and gripping. There are of course plenty of scenes that any western worth its salt is simply required to feature. Several Mexican standoffs, so delightfully stereotypical, as well as quite a few things that are new, or have not been seen for a while. A duel between two Comanches, a fighting force seeking shelter from the mighty Gatling gun, and a cowboy lighting dynamite with a cigarette as he lays dying all come to mind. I could go on for much longer about how ridiculously cool this movie's action sequences are, but I'll let you see for yourself.\r Finally, the plot, though anything but unfamiliar is a moving and epic tale about unity, loyalty, and grit. One of my favorite scenes in the movie features Jack Horne, the tracker, played by Vincent D'onofrio, (who like the rest of this all star cast is just downright amazing in a role that fits like a glove) shot by an enemy arrow. He falters, but stares at the enemy and rises. He takes a step forward, and is stopped again, a second shaft protruding from his chest. He continues his advance toward the enemy until he can no longer, dying with his dignity intact.\r The Magnificent Seven is a film that is so clich\u00e9d that it begins to feel original. And That is definitely a compliment. Not that there is anything wrong with modern westerns that try something new, like Django, or No Country For Old Men, but It is certainly a joy to watch a movie that owns these tropes for what they are, tosses some satisfying character development into the mix, and makes something out of it that is, for lack of a better adjective, positively \"Magnificent\".",

I had to ask my friend half the time for the names of the characters every time they made an important remark. The only names I know by heart are Goodnight, Sam, and Billy... The others are practically bystanders who could have been replaced with civilians in all honesty. The plot is so simple... It's TOO simple... so simple that it leaves much to be desired. The only character that was given some sort of background and or buildup was goodnight who I was only able to understand after some far-fetched interpretation that really stretched the bounds into something I have to do in AP reading (such as him having horrible memories of the Civil War and leaving the main battle scenes because of it). Other than that, I know nothing of him or the other characters for that matter. I feel as though I have more questions then were answered-\r The Civil War is over, so why is Sam given a racial connotation? I thought this was a Western movie. Pioneers traveled west to leave the past behind them and pursue opportunity. They didn't pursue Western Expansion to continue their racial stereotypes.\r What motive does the Native have in joining the 7? Other then the fact he says his Destiny is different then the rest of the tribal citizens, it is not emphasized enough.\r What's up with that ending? Where do the survivors of the 7 head off to in the distance? Is that for further audience interpretation?\r What is Sam's background with Bouge? Why does he resent him so much other then some mentioning of rape within the church scene before Bouge is shot?\r Where do the endless supply of Cavalcade come from within the final battle scene? It's obvious that a good portion was blown up by the dynamite. Furthermore, if you payed attention to the surroundings, you should have noticed the Cavalcade pushing towards the town in a Horizontal line formation where they broke up as they reached the center of town... So how is that there is more of them approaching the town from the background when the entire Cavalry pushed at one time? That was complete nonsense.\r In continuation, the battle scene had no flow of strategy. It was a free for all where all hell broke lose. The residents over Rose Creek had the advantage, then Bouge pulled out the Gatling gun, then the Residents sent whatchyama call it out to go and blow the gun up with dynamite, and the rest were cleared out... Very confusing and the only parts I actually understood were the death scenes\r My thoughts were all over the place with this movie. The only redeeming factor was the action. That's it.  Great planning with poor execution.",

The score reflects that at least the finale was mildly entertaining but for the most part the shootouts just were not done well at all.

What fell flat for me was what felt like a lack of substance. We learn a bit about the several men and the plight of the townsfolk is done well. The villain is made out to be quite despicable, which certainly adds some weight to things. But when it comes to the actual shootouts (there's two big ones), it feels like a montage of badass kill maneuvers rather than actual shootouts. What I mean is that for all the style and flare, there is very little of the fighting that actually feels real. Especially the final showdown, there are literally dozens upon dozens upon dozens of guys just randomly popping up around the town sitting atop of their horses just waiting for someone to do a badass take down of them. The initial charge there appears to be maybe a couple dozen of the baddies, but somehow despite blowing up half of them with dynamite and surprising them with a hidden trench filled with armed villagers, they continue to pop up around the town in bunches of 3 just spinning around in circles on their horses getting shot. There's a gatling gun that's used later in the fight by the bad guys even though there killing some of their own men. Why this gun wasn't used to open up the fight, (kind of like bombarding with artillery fire), is beyond me. There's no flanking maneuvers. The bad guys run at the town head on, while the good guys later charge at the gatling gun head on. But I know, I'm just beating on a dead horse. Bottom line is the action is all flare without care. So, I found it somewhat amusing to watch, but I didn't really feel attached to the characters or the townsfolk, who were basically just fodder for the bad guys to kill while the good guys hip fired their 6 shooters like a cliche straigh outta the 60's. (Oh and don't worry. No good guy ever just holsters his pistol. There is always the double spin that somehow makes really loud windmill noises while they're doing it).",

Why develop characters when they are fodder? That's a very Wild West view. Imagery pulled me in and the tactics were pretty authentic to my knowledge to the expense of maybe getting draggy because of the attention to detail. I LOVED THAT!

The fine cast is wasted on this pseudo-western showing little pathos for the underlying emotions of the original films engaging characters. The only rousing moment in the entire film was the end credits in which Elmer's Bernstein's 1960 Magnificent Seven theme is played over the credits.

So you might as well settle for this remake.This is one of those remakes nobody asked for, but you know it\u2019s gonna be somewhat special if it\u2019s led by Denzel Washington, one of the greatest movie stars of our time, a man with not often rivalled charisma and onscreen presence.It\u2019s about seven gunmen protecting a town from ruthless robber baron, simple as that. The story or screenplay are nothing special nor especially deep, but they don\u2019t even have to be, because the cast is cool and most of the time is dedicated to blasting off those guns.The direction is competent, able to use the best of western cliches and build constant suspense; dialogue is adequate; the acting is good enough but there\u2019s no point of writing about all that extensively. First and foremost, this is about shooting people, or preparing to do it, for 132 minutes.Althought the story is shallow, there is some hidden symbolism which may offer some delight for Jung fans.The seven heroes are played by Byung-hun Lee, Chris Pratt, Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Martin Sensmeier, and Vincent D'Onofrio. The robber baron is Peter Sarsgaard. Also appearing, Luke Grimes, Haley Bennett, et al.Most of the cast plays it straight but some (Hawke, D\u2019Onofrio, Sarsgaard) add a little mental instability to their performances, which brings a welcome variety.For a movie directed by Antoine Fuqua, \u201eThe Magnificent Seven\u201c is unusually modest and low-key \u2013 if you can call a story of massacre that.It never tries to get glamorous and impress us with visual inventiveness, the latter is mostly reserved for shootouts so we wouldn\u2019t have to watch men dying in same way over and over again.Then again, the world looks remarkably simple and unglamorous as the true wild west may hav been, Washington, for example, hasn\u2019t looked that ordinary on screen for a long time.So, this is a simple story well told. Fine entertainment for action lovers, or those who want to see classic western redone with modern tools and resources.",

Peter Sarsgaard's Bogue is the evil baddie menacing the small town of Rose Creek and responsible for killing Emma Cullen's (Bennet) husband. She hires the seven, brings them back to the town, and they and the remaining townsfolk get ready for the big and bloodied high noon. Washington is the anchor of this film, and you learn later why he was willing to take on Mrs. Cullen's hired work. As for the rest of the six, there is little in the way of backstory. We get some 'reasons' for why they are doing what they are doing though as turns it out, with no real emotional pay-offs or great arcs being fulfilled at film's end - well, Washington's Chisholm and Bennett's Emma Cullen's characters are given completed stories - the characters are basically memorable. In fact, some deaths, while sad, never land into poignant territory. When Hawk's Goodight Robicheaux and D'Onofrio's Jack Horne shake off their mortal coil, the audience is left with nothing in the way of pathos. They are two more fallen bodies on the scuffed and dusty earth of Rose Creek. Granted, you have seven fellows here to focus on but the script could have been a bit more economical in what to share to the audience and what to sacrifice. This is a film where few relationships are made. Seven hired guns who do a job and some die and some live. The end.",
