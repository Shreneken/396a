  "critic_reviews": [
    "Like the musical itself, the film has timeless charm and a brave sense of adventure. Bravo!",
    "Audacious, retro, funny and heartfelt, La La Land is the latest great musical for people who don’t like musicals – and will slap a mile-wide smile across the most miserable of faces.",
    "Could have been a grand folly but instead it’s just grand. Will make audiences break into grins like its characters break into song.",
    "Utterly magnificent and intoxicating.",
    "Chazelle’s script is hopeful and sweet and clever and rich. His direction is innovative and captivating.",
    "Stone is spectacular, and she's reason enough to see La La Land. Chazelle is a born filmmaker, and he doesn't settle for rehashing familiar bits from musicals we already love. He's too busy giving us reasons to fall for this one.",
    "The real star in La La Land is the movie itself, which pulses and glows like a living thing in its own right, as if the MGM musicals of the “Singin’ in the Rain” era had a love child with the more abstract confections of Jacques Demy, creating a new kind of knowing, self-aware genre that rewards the audience with all the indulgences they crave...while commenting on them from the sidelines.",
    "La La Land is a trove of references to musical milestones, not derivative but truly inspired. A more joyful movie for grown-ups can't be found this season.",
    "Gosling is terrific as the coolly introspective yet disarmingly charming Sebastian. And Stone is deservedly generating Oscar buzz for her portrayal of an artist who can’t quite believe she’ll ever be anything other than a barista.",
    "Here is a celebration of the artistic drive that is also a daring feat of showmanship, as technically accomplished in its own way as “Mad Max Fury Road” or “The Revenant.\"",
    "It’s almost criminal to have to stay in your seat when the contact high of La La Land is goosing you to grand jeté in the aisle. The heart, at least, is at liberty to swell to bursting.",
    "Gosling is terrific, playing hangdog and irritable yet still managing to be someone you root for (even if you want to smack him in the head every now and then). Stone is even better. It’s her best performance, and that’s saying something. Their relationship, their chemistry, everything about it, and everything about La La Land is, well, magic.",
    "La La Land is a film with strikingly broad appeal. Whether you're a \"Star Wars\" geek or a hopeless romantic, a jazz fan or somebody who complains they just don't make 'em like they used to anymore, you'll la-la love it.",
    "It’s a beautiful and hopeful film, coming at a time when there isn’t much beauty or hope in our movies, and it’s the type of picture — a sprawling, exuberant musical drama — that hasn’t been seen in decades.",
    "Like a gift from the movie gods, here comes Damien Chazelle’s dreamy La La Land, right when a lot of us are in desperate need of some light. It’s a valentine to cinema, splashed with primary colors and velvety L.A. sunsets.",
    "For all its borrowing and bricolage, La La Land never feels like a backward-looking or unoriginal work. Even when not every one of its risks pays off the way that first song does, this movie is bold, vital, funny, and alive.",
    "The fact that neither Stone nor Gosling are tip-top song-and-dance artists is, in some ways, integral to their appeal. If they were Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, we might not feel as much of a kinship with them.",
    "Damien Chazelle’s musical, consistently daring and occasionally sublime, does what the movies have all but forgotten how to do — sweep us up into a dream of love that’s enhanced in an urgent present by the mythic power of Hollywood’s past.",
    "It’s stunningly ambitious and thrillingly alive the way the best movies are.",
    "Stone, who wowed on Broadway in “Cabaret,” again shows off some beautiful pipes. She captivates completely from her first frame. Then again, so does La La Land — a singing love letter to musicals, romance and the City of Angels that feels almost like a gift from above.",
    "The actors carry the music in their gait, their gestures, the rhythms of their speech, so that their singing and dancing is a small but exquisite step up from the way that they normally talk and walk. To rhapsodize about La La Land is to complete the experience. You want to sing its praises, literally.",
    "What makes La La Land such a hot miracle is how the passion for cinema and its possibilities radiates from every frame.",
    "La La Land is both delightful confection and life-affirming food for the soul.",
    "Some of it is wistful, some of it whimsical, but it's all wonderful, impossibly so.",
    "La La Land is both a love letter to a confounding and magical city and an ode to the idea of the might-have-been romance, in all its piercing sweetness. It’s a movie with the potential to make lovers of us all. All we have to do is fall into its arms.",
    "La La Land isn’t a masterpiece (and on some level it wants to be). Yet it’s an exciting ramble of a movie, ardent and full of feeling, passionate but also exquisitely — at times overly — controlled.",
    "For all its postmodern smarts, La La Land has a heart as big as its Cinemascope screen. This is primarily down to the two leads, without their performances it would only be an empty, if impressive, exercise in dizzying technical skill and style.",
    "La La Land wants to remind us how beautiful the half-forgotten dreams of the old days can be – the ones made up of nothing more than faces, music, romance and movement. It has its head in the stars, and for a little over two wonderstruck hours, it lifts you up there too.",
    "For Chazelle to be able to pull this off the way he has is something close to remarkable. The director's feel for a classic but, for all intents and purposes, discarded genre format is instinctive and intense.",
    "I was utterly absorbed by this movie’s simple storytelling verve and the terrific lead performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone who are both excellent – particularly Stone, who has never been better.",
    "La La Land is a film you simply never want to stop watching. It has wisdom and joy and sadness and such magic, from the evocative power of music to the transportative power of movies.",
    "What the two actors lack in vocal polish they make up for in commitment — and chemistry. La La Land is the third film to romantically pair Gosling and Stone, after \"Crazy, Stupid, Love\" and \"Gangster Squad,\" and that history of onscreen relationships fortifies their playful rapport:",
    "Its complete lack of restraint, cynicism, or self-consciousness invites viewers to drop their own reservations and just feel the big, broad, simple emotions as they're played out on-screen, through memorable songs and elaborate fantasy sequences.",
    "It’s a twinkling surface examination of how humans try to coordinate their dreams with their reality (a very Hollywood conundrum), but also a celebration of just how wonderful old filmmaking techniques and emotions look and feel on modern L.A. streets.",
    "La La Land succeeds both as a fizzy fantasy and a hard-headed fable, a romantic comedy and a showbiz melodrama, a work of sublime artifice and touching authenticity.",
    "La La Land feels like a throwback and also like something we've never seen before, resulting in a dreamy musical that hits just about every note.",
    "Catch the film on the largest screen you can find, with a sound system to match, even if that means journeying all day. Have a drink beforehand. And, whatever you do, don’t wait for a DVD or a download.",
    "With infectious enthusiasm, charismatic leads, gorgeous songs, vibrant colors, and dazzling camerawork, La La Land restores the original movie musical to its former glory.",
    "The musical is as malleable and eclectic a genre as any other, and Chazelle reminds us how effectively it can be applied to intimate moments as well as huge ones.",
    "If “Whiplash” was Damien Chazelle’s bullet train through dark regions of the New York jazz world, La La Land is his leisurely bus tour through sunlit fantasies of life in Los Angeles.",
    "Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers they ain’t. Stone’s singing voice is a soulful wisp of a thing. But this is the moment that convinced me the film’s writer-director, Damien Chazelle, knew exactly what he was doing. What his stars lack in training they make up for in relatability. They sing and dance just a little better than we would.",
    "La La Land isn’t just the best made-for-the-screen musical to reach theaters in a very long time, it’s arguably the best (non-animated) cinematic musical of any kind since 1986’s delightful \"Little Shop of Horrors.\" Yes, it’s more vibrant than \"Chicago,\" more heartfelt than \"Les Miserables,\" and more successfully staged than a chorus of other contenders.",
    "Gosling and Stone get these characters, finding grace in their movement but emotional depth in their arcs; Stone has never been better.",
    "For a movie that all but demands that you swoon into its arms, La La Land doesn’t always seem to know exactly how to surrender to itself.",
    "[Chazelle's] soaring, romantic, extremely stylish and endlessly inventive La La Land is that rare beast: a grown-up movie musical that's not kitschy, a joke or a Bollywood film. Instead, it's a swooning, beautifully crafted ode to the likes of Jacques Demy's The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and Stanley Donen's Singin' in the Rain.",
    "As a drama, this is less nourishing than the heritage it pays tribute to. But for Chazelle, the story is just a slight rib around which he builds a modern rhapsody.",
    "So in spite of its flaws, La La Land has moments of pleasure and satisfaction that are worth the price of admission. It’s not that it’s a bad movie; it’s just not an outstanding entertainment, the way great movies (especially musicals) should be.",
    "The superficial thrills of the genre are all present and adoringly rendered, but the actual purpose of the whole exercise is much harder to discern.",
    "La La Land is magically in tune with its reference points even as falls a few notes short of their greatness.",
    "La La Land...reaches for the stars, doesn't quite grab them all, and then is still kind of OK in the end.",
    "La La Land deserves credit for high spirits even if it’s essentially a collection of glamorous throwback music videos for so-so songs.",
    "Writer-director Damien Chazelle (“Whiplash”) reaches for the stars, and cast the picture beautifully. But this throwback musical (songs by Justin Hurwitz) lurches along on show business cliches in between dreamy flights of fancy.",
    "If only the script measured up to the craft. La La Land gives us no reason to root for Mia and Seb’s romance, except for its blithe assurance that you will because you loved Stone and Gosling together in Crazy, Stupid, Love.",
    "Every element of La La Land is bound up in a referentiality that largely precludes the outpourings of emotion we come to musicals for."

However, after sitting with it for two days, with the images andAfter watching this film at the Chicago International Film Festival, my original plan was to wait until closer to the film's actual release date to give my thoughts on it. However, after sitting with it for two days, with the images and sounds still sweeping through my mind, I cannot help myself. I will be as vague as possible, because I do not want to ruin the experience of seeing it for the first time, but I have to talk about it.La La Land, as it has been advertised, pays homage to classic movie musicals. Not only does it visually allude to films such as Singin' in the Rain and The Band Wagon, but it also preserves the upbeat, wondrous tone of those classics. There is something wonderful about seeing this tone and style recreated for a modern film. Cynicism and pretentiousness are completely absent from this film, and nostalgia and joy take their place.But calling La La Land a terrific recreation of the classic movie musical is selling it short. Like director Damien Chazelle's previous work, La La Land has much more going on narratively than the movie may lead people to believe. On the surface, this is a love story about two artists trying to make their ways in Los Angeles. However, this framework is deceptively simple.La La Land forces us to think about the realities of personal relationships and artistic endeavors. It explores the excitement of our dreams, the hardships of pursuing these dreams, and forces the audience to question the importance of both. Fortunately, Chazelle never looks down on the audience with these ideas. They are not presented in a heavy handed manner, and he never forces you to think a certain way.On top of its thematic richness, La La Land has one of the best understandings of film as a storytelling medium that I have seen in recent years. On the surface, it is the most technically astounding. The cinematography is stunning, and the soundtrack is beautiful. Even better is that both the visuals and soundtrack are never used in a way that is shallow or uninteresting. La La Land has an understanding of how to tell a story visually. It understands the power of sequencing, the power images can have on the emotional impact of a story, and the way in which these images simultaneously indulge our fantasies and remind us of our humanity.In other words, for me, it embodies everything that I love about movies.There are instances that everyone can recall in a cinema where we have felt what I like to call \"movie magic.\" These are evoked by the films that completely absorb us into its world, and movies that have a lasting, personal impact on us far beyond the theater. They are the films that we hold as the pinnacle of what makes watching movies so great.La La Land is one of those movies.During its 128 minute running time, the only time I wanted to look away from the screen was to turn to the people around me and check and see if they were experiencing the same kind of magic that I was. I can affirm that everyone I saw in my theater was.La La Land is a masterpiece. It is not only the best movie of 2016 so far, but also possibly one of the best of the decade. It's spectacular, stunning, moving, and absolutely magical.",

Coloring the 70mmGosling and Stone shines and as a result Chazelle marks his name on the wall.La La LandChazelle is on a strike. With successive jaw dropping projects coming out, his passion grows more intense and the cinema much larger. Coloring the 70mm screen with rich mesmeric visuals, the director, Damien Chazelle is boasting his love with proper understanding of the Hollywood culture that he so blindingly adores. Not an inch goes by in the film that looks pretentious, working over a year on editing along with Tom Cross, Chazelle wishes you to understand the \"if's\" and \"but's\" of this show business in one note. And boy what a note it is. I am sorry but that hooked theme of Justin Hurwitz, whispered in every line of the film always sobers me up.All hail the production team for carving out this desert as fresh as it looks, from clothes to designing and from locations to set pieces, the view gets better and better and so does the performance. And daunting as this task may sound, but Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling might be the new Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. But unlike them they aren't quirky but are goofy about the relationship and flirty about their first love. If Stone going over the montages of failed auditions is a threat, then Gosling on piano is her equal competitor.I have always preferred them alone, one is happy being stubborn and intuitive- something that she later on adapts from him- and other being mature and hard on herself. Together, they would fall apart, they are meant to be, no matter how in sync are they while dancing and how pitch perfect are they while singing, their rhythm is too vacuumed by the outer world to float in one room, maybe they should have just stayed in that cinema hall, but despite of claiming it to be a La La Land, this is the reality, they had to get out.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nFrom the talented director of Whiplash, comes another musical masterpiece: La La Land. This movie is about the romance of aspiring actress Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), they both have great chemistry and they're one of the best movie couples in recent cinema, director Damien Chazelle had the talent to write and develop their relationship really well. As this is a musical, it obviously has many musical numbers throughout the movie and they're all fantastic and serve a purpose to the plot.The Good:-The performances are amazing.-The script, dialogue and character development are great. The chemistry between the main characters is just wonderful.-The score and music is memorable and beautiful.-The ending scene is one of the best ending scenes I've seen in a long time and the message it tries to give is sad but true: That sometimes couples need to separate and both go in different ways to accomplish their dreams. It's a lighthearted, depressing yet satisfying ending and it's more tearjerking with the beautiful music, the last shot of the movie is Mia and Seb smiling to each other is an amazing ending, pretty refreshing to see a couple actually not ending together, it makes the ending unpredictable.-Obviously the rest of the movie is as amazing as that last scene. The musical numbers are memorable, catchy and well choreographed.The Bad:-I think the only \"bad\" or not so good thing is Ryan Gosling's acting as Sebastian. He did a good job but he didn't really shine as much as other actors, specially his in-movie couple Mia (Emma Stone).La La Land is a masterpiece of a movie, I could watch it over and over and nothing of it will ever get old at least for me.",

I recently watched a movie called \"La La Land: California Dreams\" again. For the first time, I saw this movie in the cinema last year when we went to see it with classmates. The genre of the film is a musical romantic, comedy and drama film, and the film was released on August 31, 2016. The film employ and location is in California. In the same year, the film also nominated for the Oscars.Actress Mia tries to play a famous play where she wants to take part. She will work in the breakfast cafe otherwise there is a waitress. Because she has a sad mood the same evening, then she will have a restaurant in the evening and a muscian Sebastian, whom she will soon fall in love, will play the piano. The same night, Sebastian was fired from work, as the restaurant manager wanted to put his restaurant around for a band to listen to people. Sebastian goes to work on one of the record labels, and Mia begins to create her own play. The film employ is very fast-moving. At the end of the film, they admit to each other that while they care about each other, they will not be able to live together in the future.It seemed to me that the film is light-hearted and there were different twists and turns in the film. There were a lot of different details and effects in the film that changed the film´s environment. This film had a big-budget, but it is a world-famous piece of musical.My opinion about the film is very good, because people dance and sing a lot, and this make the movie a great one. I recommend this movie to people: first, who like musicals and secondly, dream far away from the world.",

It includes impeccably choreographed dancing, great songs and an excellent score, along with excellent performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Chazelle's direction is very assured and the movie has excellent cinematography. It's visuals and excellent musical numbers allude to classic musicals with an upbeat, and dream-like tone. The movie can be interpreted in several ways, but for a less discerning viewer the subtle message of being willing to let go with each other to follow your dreams could be missed, if so i recommend a second viewing. Both Mia and Sebastian achieve their dreams but the movie shows a beautiful and heartbreaking montage of what could have been if their relationship was perfect. But the whimsical tone is contrasted with raw emotion and shows the reality of going to L.A. to achieve your dreams. La La Land was the best movie of 2016 and must be seen. I watched La La Land recently, my expectations weren't that high, I was expecting a good movie, but not a masterpiece on the level of this film. La La Land is an instant classic.",

Acting is great. You'll be smiling from minute one with the Original intro with 'Another day of sun' sung by a whole bunch of dancers dancing on the freeway. It ends a bit more sad, with the broken up couple looking back to the movie with some happy and sad music.Great experience, if you didn't liked it the first time, be sure to give it a second try, changes your perspective and gives you a better look at the movie and its characters.On of my all time favorites for sure.",

And this film is a musical masterpiece. Someone said they were getting tired of Chazelle's boner for jazz. Well, if every movie Chazelle does is as powerful and driven as this and Whiplash, I will never get tired of his massive boner for jazz.Hurwitz sets the tone using music in a way I have not seen since Lord of the Rings. He develops themes subtly when you least expect them and then blasts them into your face to trigger a serious emotional response. The first two songs, Another Day of Sun and Someone in the Crowd, meld together throughout the rest of the movie in a way that they become almost indistinguishable. Audition's theme is subtly hinted at when Mia is talking about her childhood, so you already heard the kernel of it when she starts singing it. Finally, the epilogue blends together every piece of music masterfully and all the themes, all the emotions come gushing out. The fact that Chazelle and Hurwitz came up with the idea for the movie together is what allows most of this to happen. The bond between what you are seeing and what you are hearing is so intrinsic that it becomes overpowering.Best soundtrack of the decade by far.",

Set in a magical, half-imagined LA, every movement and magical note is essential to the wholeness of this film, from the very first glimpse to the ending credits. Ryan Gosling's performance embodies the very crisis of an artist who loves music but is overlooked so badly. His half-bored, half-enthusiastic impressions make the movie very entertaining. Emma Stone is brilliant. Without her elaborately subtle and honest performance, the movie would lose part of it's magic. I believe she is one of the very best young actresses.

Ably performed by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, the film tells the story of an aspiring actress and a dedicated jazz musician as they search to find and realize each of their respective dreams. Ms. Stone and Mr.Gosling have never been seen or known as singers or dancers so the viewer is at first suspect and in doubt that either of these two can properly fulfill the roles the parts demand. To the surprise and satisfaction of all involved, they are a delight to watch and listen to as they seque from drama to musical numbers all in a subtle and lovely transition. This also lends to the credibility of the film and its story under the able direction of Mr. Chazelle. The film also provides the viewer with a delightful series of songs and jazz sessions which add to the positive experience. I give this film a 9 for it is not only a sweet, simple and charming story of hope and ambition in the City of Los Angeles but a reminder that good films can still be made using the once forgotten formulae of mid-20th‘century moviemaking.",

So go see it.That said, I am not happy to report that the movie comes up way short to its Hollywood and French musical antecedents; the gap between what the film aspires to and what it achieves is too great to ignore. The wide-screen Hollywood musicals were a tour-de-force of great singing talent, great dancing talent, flawless staging, studio lighting and cinematography. The actors just are not up to the task of singing and dancing, and I would argue that Ryan Gosling did not even act that well and served as a bit of a downer when exuberance is what was called for. The steadicam camerawork is really sloppy, frequently mis-framing and not using the wide-screen effectively, with many blurry portrait shots. There is occasional and shocking dark vignetting at the corners, and oftentimes mediocre to terrible lighting. The story line, dialogue and plot turns are as trivial as the movies of the past. It seems that the main virtue of the movie is that it is a contemporary attempt at the genre, but really does not offer a great critique or insightful iteration to those movies, it just is not as good. The insertion of the fake super-8 \"memory\" footage is one of the few attempts to change up the format, but it is a horrible and cheap conceit in any movie. The first scene promises what the rest of the movie does not offer, where the entire world breaks into song and dance. The romantic sparks between the two main characters for the rest of the film are not very emotional.",

Damien Chazelle, like Whiplash, creates a world and story that everyone can connect to, dealing with striving for perfection or reminiscing old love. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have perfect chemistry, add with great song, music and lyrics, the movie can't get any better.",

I don't how many of you are old enough to remember Pauline Kael of the New Yorker, Vincent Canby on the New York Times, Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune, and of course, my favorite, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times. In those days, you couldn't just pop out a cute little movie and expect the critics to rave, uncontrollably. Those critics would dissect every fabric and every film cell. When they were done with their reviews you knew, pretty much, what to expect. But not anymore, cutesy movies like \"The Artist\", \"Birdman\" and \"Silver Lining Playbook\" and the like, are given way more credit than they deserve by today's movie critics. In fact, I think todays movie critics go overboard for anything that is just a little bit different.  Well, \"La La Land\" is a little bit different. But its just a cutesy little movie that's nice and neat. That's all it is. All of the glowing praise by the critics is laughable. Actually the best parts of movie are the scenes with John Legend in them",

The dancing was competent but very unexceptional. This is not Ginger Rodgers and Fred Astaire. The story is average, except that the latter portion skips over a number of years without explanation and tells us nothing of what happened in between. It was rather strange and seemed like a shortcut to end the movie in a way that appeared modern and cynical, as if the writers felt they had to do that since the rest of the movie was so old fashioned.

So I was not expecting it to be a great or worst. The film opened with a song that I was not happy, because I did not like the verse or the music. And again to say, the modern timeline does not suit for the musical theme, unless it is a fantasy or an Indian film. The best part of the film was, those song fades away as the film progresses. But I kind of liked the drama/story part and the climax track with the quick flashback (kind of). Till that scene I was considering it an average film, but that one scene changed my stance. So, now I think it is a good film, but winning 6 Oscars, I don't know it deserved that.Yes, the director is known for making music and musical film, but he has not made many. He's young and so his career. Yep, I loved 'Whiplash'. One of my all time favourite. If that film had won 10 Oscars, I would have not surprised at all. After that flick, the people were anticipating, to exceed that success in this film. As it was received, no doubt for those people it was a different flick, but not for me. Especially if you watch lots of Indian films. By the way the film characters were nice, and so the story, but not the songs.Gosling and Stone were performed well. The chemistry between them was great. The narration was going decently until the end, which reminded me 'Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya' ending that I was not happy about, yet something different than usual. Sometimes I am okay with cliché than this kind of conclusion, just to bring a change in storytelling. Overall an enjoyable film, most people would love it. Some like me would say it is a decent flick, but there's always a few who would never favour it. Yet worth a watch.7/10",

I don't know why Mamma Mia's Metascore is just 51 and La La Land's is 93. This film is maybe a \"little\" overrated. I just saw it yesterday. Mamma Mia's soundtrack was made with songs of Abba, songs everybody knows. When they sang in that movie, it all seems normal. But in this movie, you can realize while watching that it's not real, not normal. I love the concept, the story. But I hated the final. It is different from the one I thought before. But, you know, a good movie is determinated by a good final. Good, but boring sometimes. I'm happy it won 6 Oscars, but I don't think it deserved 14 Nominations.

Eu finalmente assisti o filme sem o hype todo. Eu anulei todas as críticas que eu li e só assisti o filme. O filme não é só sobre a Mia que deseja ser atriz e o Sebastian que quer abrir um bar de jazz. Vendo o filme com atenção eu percebi que é mais do que isso. Quantas vezes você não esteve em uma relação e acabou se sentindo frustrado pela pessoa conseguir realizar um sonho e você continuar ali parado? Quantas vezes a vida já te deu um não e você se viu sem forçar para continuar e acreditar no seu sonho? O sonho de Mia era ser uma atriz sim, um clássico clichê de holiwood. Mas não tem que ser isso não. Qualquer um que tem um sonho sabe como é levar um soco na cara da vida. Eu vi muitas pessoas reclamando do final também, mas e dai? Sinceramente. Vamos parar de ficar colocando defeitos onde não existem. Algumas pessoas talvez estivessem esperando um conto de fadas não sei e aí ao chegar no final do filme leva esse tapa na cara. Eu não tenho vergonha de dizer que eu me emocionei com o filme, principalmente com o final. Eu não pensei que poderia me tocar tanto. É tão simples e ao mesmo tempo tão intenso que agora eu entendo porque tantas pessoas amaram e odiaram esse filme. Se você assiste La La Land no hype de ser mais um romance clichê é nítido que você vai odiar esse filme. Emma Stone que eu cheguei a criticar eu percebi que nos 45 do segundo tempo ela conseguiu impressionar demais e fez uma atuação MARAVILHOSA. Os filmes tem alguns defeitos sim, mas acho que o que mais importou pra mim foi a mensagem que ele quis passar. Acho que daqui uns anos as pessoas vão perceber que, apesar dos clichês, o filme passa uma mensagem linda",

At a time when musicals are not at all fashionable this one knocks it out of the park on all emotional and aesthetic levels. It is without question the best film of the year. An audacious opening song and dance number on an L A freeway sets the tone and here is where audiences will either embrace it or leave. Those who stay will be treated to one of those transcendent experiences that are all too rare in today's cinema. Who knew that Emma Stone could be this good demonstrating a range, and a voice, that takes one completely by surprise. Wonderfully supported by Ryan Gosling, the pair effortlessly create chemistry usually not seen outside a lab. Their renditions of a clutch of memorable songs are dynamically performed and stunningly choreographed. Stone's dulcet tones singing' Audition- The fools who dream' is heartbreakingly evocative and succeeds in raising the hairs on one's arms and neck. In fact the score and sound make the film seem like a throwback to an earlier age as does the gorgeous colour cinematography. Technically, every aspect of this unique entertainment has the wow factor. Emotionally the film is very well grounded with its biggest flight of fancy taking place at the Griffith observatory. Director Damien Chazelle trumps his achievement on 'Whiplash' by triumphantly reviving a moribund genre. That he has produced such a dazzling and accomplished piece of cinema in the process is no small feat. If this doesn't win best picture and actress at next year's Oscars (it will of course be loaded with them) then the Academy members themselves must be living in La La Land.",

La La Land has the nostalgic charms and beauty of musical theater, was uncompromising in qualities that define and is celebrated in traditional musicals. La La Land didn't just bring traditional musical theatre to film, it used film to take musical theatre to another level. La La Land overcame the shortcomings and limitations of theatre with film. Imaginative gorgeous aesthetics, excellent unobtrusive storytelling, impeccable directing, precise pacing, magnificent performances by the leads.. What makes La La Land work so well for me is that amidst the romanticized nature of musical storytelling and visuals, the story of the film is grounded in harsh reality. La La Land beautifully celebrates idealism to deliver a greater impact when reality hits.For me, as someone who loves the imaginative liberality of animations, emotional impacts of musicals and enchanting fantasy of art that leaves you at the mercy of its creators, La La Land is the pinnacle of a movie going experience so far in my life.",

I give it an 8 due to its beauty, charm, elegance and the perfect and very surprising cast. Emma Stone fits the role like a glove. She is the film in a way. Ryan Goslin is absolutely perfect in the role too, but he has way less to do in the film. The opening is so fresh and engaging. And I found the last 10 minutes to be perfect too. However, I was not that engaged in the story. Emma´s character is quite unlikeable. And Ryan´s character is cute, but still not engaging enough. For you to be really involved in a film you have to care about what happens. There are also a few moments where I lost the interest and got a little bored. It also had some stereotypes going on. I still give it an 8 for all the effort and the beauty in it, and the acting. I´d feel bad giving a film like this a lower rate. But it didn´t wow me, or move me.",

I love it!>Related media: There are no related media to this film.>What's it like?: It starts with an upbeat song about the aspirations of those who wish to succeed in LA that really wakes you up and make you hunger for more. It then elaborates on what an actor and a musician would need to do to succeed in LA, as they fall in love with each other and you fall in love with them. It’s a musical, but one that you can tolerate as it doesn’t unnecessarily go into a song at every opportunity.>Pros:>1. The opening upbeat song, Another Day of Sun, wakes you and prepares you to like the rest of the film.>2. The two leads are very charming and you’d love them to make it in the end.>3. All of the other songs are as good as the opener.>4. This is a musical that you can tolerate as the actors do not unnecessarily break into song at every opportunity.>5. The melancholic ending. The best love stories have melancholic endings.>Cons: The ending? Ha ha… No, that’s not a con. Think Casablanca.>How would the different age groups rate it?Children: GoodTeenagers: Good Young adults: ExcellentMedium age adults: ExcellentOld adults: ExcellentMy rating: 5/5 (no half scores). Watch it in the cinema and then buy the DVD.",

Um sentimento saudosista que mescla o melhor da era de ouro de Hollywood,As vezes assistimos a filmes antigos que nos trazem brilho no olhar e ao mesmo tempo nos perguntamos: \"Por que não fazem mais filmes assim?\" La La Land é sobre isso. Um sentimento saudosista que mescla o melhor da era de ouro de Hollywood, mas sem pesar demais na nostalgia, tornando-o assim, uma espécie de retro-futurista.  Mia e Sebastian são dois sonhadores vivendo em Los Angeles. De um lado Mia (Emma Stone) sonha em ser uma atriz famosa, porém em meio a tantos testes, ainda não encontrou seu papel. Já Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) é um jovem apaixonado por Jazz que sonha em ter seu próprio clube, porém sofre  com a falta de popularidade do gênero musical. Quando o destino dos dois se cruzam, temos o nosso filme.La La Land é, a cima de tudo, sobre sonhos. A força de vontade e a paixão que os personagens tem  seja pelo Jazz ou pela atuação, inspira o telespectador. Damien Chazelle triunfa ao mesclar elementos do cinema clássico com regalias modernas. A inspiração é clara no longa, mas em nenhum momento o filme se torna nostálgico demais, ele anda com as próprias pernas e cria sua identidade própria. Stone e Gosling já provaram sua perfeita sintonia em filmes como 'Crazy Stupid Love' e 'Gangster Squad' e agora, em sua terceira colaboração, os dois brilham juntos. Emma atua com sutilidade, seus gestos, sua voz, a dança...Tudo contribui para a construção de uma personagem que é ao mesmo tempo doce e atrevida. Stone é o coração de La La Land, ainda mais quando está junta com Gosling, que por sua vez, também não fica para trás. Ryan da vida com mestria para Sebastian, um personagem apaixonado e ao mesmo tempo apaixonante. Em todas as suas cenas juntos, Emma e Ryan conquistam um pouco mais o coração da audiência, suas vozes juntos criam um contraste agridoce que é tão agradável aos ouvidos quanto suas danças tímidas são agradáveis aos olhos. Mesmo não sendo profissionais em dança e canto como Gene Kelly e Debbie Reynolds por exemplo, é visível o esforço dos dois e seus passos acanhados e vozes suaves são mais que suficiente para relevar este pequeno detalhe.  Tecnicamente falando, La La Land é irretocável. Chazelle brinca com as cores no longa, sempre podemos observar a presença de uma luz neon refletindo no rosto de um dos protagonistas. O figurino é sempre com cores primas, cores estas que estão sempre presentes na palheta do filme, o figurino é um dos grandes méritos do filme, pois é moderno e ao mesmo tempo retro, assim como diversas coisas no longa.  A fotografia também se destaca. As cores vivas do céu contribuem para  cenas espetaculares. O compromisso de fazer um trabalho bem executado gera resultados aqui. A explosão de cores, seja no céu ou no figurino gera reação imediata da audiência e ainda é um deleite para os olhos de quem assiste.  Como dito a cima, a direção de Damian Chazelle atinge seu ápice aqui. Sua direção é extremamente competente. Logo na cena inicial do longa, vemos uma cena de musical em um engarrafamento onde todos os jovens saem de seus devidos carros e começam a dançar. Toda a cena é filmada em plano sequência com takes abertos e aí temos uma noção da excelência do diretor. La La Land é uma doce carta de amor para a era de ouro de Hollywood. Suas músicas doces e animadas ficam grudadas em sua cabeça e a beleza vista aqui vai muito além dos aspectos técnicos. Simplesmente um filme para ser eternizado.",
