  "critic_reviews": [
    "Once in awhile, a movie comes along that is so touching and sincere, without a moment of false emotion or manipulative self-indulgence, that it establishes squatters’ rights and moves into your heart to stay.",
    "This amazing true story with remarkable performances by Dev Patel, Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman and newcomer Sunny Pawar has, like the title would suggest, a blend of brute force and elegance.",
    "A sober and yet profoundly stirring contemplation of family, roots, identity and home, which engrosses throughout the course of its two-hour running time.",
    "Lion is a beautifully told, uplifting story of courage and determination.",
    "It’s a mesmerizing story, particularly that vivid first half, told with great economy and few words.",
    "The beauty of Lion is that it explores and allows for the unique possibilities and power of multiple homes, multiple families and multiple selves.",
    "Lion is moving and inspiring.",
    "Let’s just say if you are human, there is no way that Lion won’t move you.",
    "Unsurprisingly, the finale is manipulative in every way, squeezing out the emotions of the audience. But Lion’s well-plotted narrative and thoughtful characters suck you in so much that the journey there is totally worth it.",
    "Director Garth Davis’ debut is a touch over-stretched but impossible to resist – a classy crowd-pleaser with an especially magical first half.",
    "An astonishing true story that’s treated with an admirably light and artistic touch, rather than an overly dramatic heavy hand. Despite a weaker second half, it is ultimately deeply moving.",
    "Saroo is played dazzlingly by Dev Patel, who gives his richest performance since Mira Nair’s “The Namesake.”",
    "The script never lunges for cheap drama by forcing Saroo into a binary choice between mothers, and the most complex beats are about tip-toeing around, often counter-productively, to avoid hurt or betrayal.",
    "If Saroo’s story seems out-of-this world, the team behind this film have risen to meet the challenge it sets. There may be a sense of inevitability about Saroo’s ultimate destination, but what counts here is the journey.",
    "By turns sad, frightening, and inspirational, the movie is impeded only by the difficulty of bridging the 25-year span between segments and accepting the older lead (Dev Patel) as a replacement for his younger self (Sunny Pawar).",
    "Lion is a complex movie, with its profound themes of home and identity, and its tonally disparate halves. A smartly understated approach to Brierley’s story holds it all together. Sometimes the truth alone is enough.",
    "Child actor Pawar is extraordinary as Saroo during his terrifying odyssey, and Davis portrays the streets of Calcutta, teeming with homeless children and adults, as if they were one of the rings of hell from \"Dante's Inferno.\"",
    "Director Garth Davis gets to the heart of the drama without slipping into sentimentality.",
    "Lion can't avoid seeming lesser in the second half after Davis' mesmeric first but it's solid storytelling nonetheless. Bring the Kleenex.",
    "First-time Australian director Garth Davis offers sweeping cinematic shots, with a soundtrack that is pleasingly epic, but the second act is a bit skimpy, script-wise.",
    "If you’re looking for a reinvention of the biopic formula, there are plenty of films this season to set you up. If you think there’s still room for the traditional ‘true-story’ drama, Lion proves these stories still have a little life left in them.",
    "Where the first half of the film had power and sweep, the second half is a bunch of Post-it notes.",
    "This is a true story, and at times a gut-wrenching one, even if it necessarily sugarcoats some aspects of the plight of lost children.",
    "The young star, maturing nicely past the boyish enthusiasm he showed in \"Slumdog Millionaire\" and \"Marigold Hotel\" films, enters a new phase of his career with fierce commitment. Lion is one from the heart.",
    "Where Saroo goes and what he finds there left me in tears, but you feel that a complicated true story has been airbrushed into a postmodern legend.",
    "Lion, the first feature directed by Garth Davis, sufficiently realizes the emotional arc built into Brieley’s experience.",
    "Davis is not above manipulating the audience at the end of the film, but so what? It works. And that closing credit, man. Some things are worth waiting for.",
    "Once Lion's can't-miss conclusion hovers into view, the film's periodic over-dramatization matters less. A story like this is finally impossible to mess up, and pretending otherwise is beside the point.",
    "It’s a tonally imperfect film that’s nonetheless ideal for holiday viewing, a respite from \"Rogue One\" perhaps, or simply an exciting, old-school explorer’s tale well told (for the most part).",
    "In trying to tell the whole of this nearly implausible tale, the film can’t figure out whether it’s more invested in young Saroo’s harrowing journey or older Saroo’s feeling of displacement.",
    "Lion is shameless and heartfelt and you’ll probably have a good, happy cry at the end. When a story pushes buttons so deeply wired into our consciousness...craft seems almost beside the point.",
    "Lion's faults of structure and pacing might limit its power, but in stretches it still roars.",
    "Its lasting resonance and wider humanitarian message is diluted by a second half that drags it down.",
    "Commercial filmmaking still fumbles interiority and moral complexity. So it’s fortunate for the filmmakers that Brierley's book also is thick with the kinds of things that crowdpleasers ace.",
    "As a purely emotional experience it succeeds without feeling too manipulative or maudlin. I mean, it is manipulative and maudlin, but in a way that seems fair and transparent. Still, it isn’t quite satisfying.",
    "By the time Lion has really begun, it already seems half over. That’s not to say the picture isn’t satisfying in a straight-to-the-gut way.",
    "Thanks largely to an affecting performance from newcomer Sunny Pawar, the first act is horribly effective.",
    "There’s plenty of warmth and compassion here, and the true story is a belter, but this ‘Lion’ doesn’t quite roar.",
    "If the first half is an indelible treat and gives one high hopes that a film delicately placed in the awards season will in fact meet its steep expectations, the second half is troublesome and falls flat.",
    "It’s the kind of movie that wouldn’t exist without awards, and makes a compelling argument for phasing them out altogether.",
    "Lion may be a little too Oscar-bait-y, but it's not without loud emotional roars.",
    "Lion goes again and again where you expect it to, delivering little more than the awards-season equivalent of \"Homeward Bound.\"",
    "As is proved by documentary footage at the end, Garth Davis’s film is based on a true story; though wrenching, there is barely enough of it to fill the dramatic space, and the second half is a slow and muted affair after the Dickensian punch of the first.",
    "While Lion isn’t the kind of drama that demands risky storytelling, it is one that has within it a whole world of emotional topography that is disappointingly scrolled over instead of mapped out.",
    "Fortunately for Davis, he’s got a terrific cast, chief among them the pair of charismatic actors who split the lead role."

The trailers made it look a bit too much like a made-for TV film, but this actually proved to be so much more! It was an incredibly heartfelt true story, consisted of great and memorable performances, especially from Dev Patel who's never been better or more inspirational, and was just all-around a well-made and compelling film! My only minor dissenting bit of criticism is that the film's emotional grasp let go of me right before the credits with a brief advertisement of helping endangered and lost children in India. I'm not saying I hated this at all, as it was very admirable. It just kind of took me out of my emotional investment of the film during the very final moments which sort of bothered me. Nonetheless, this was still an incredibly inspirational, well-acted, and depicted true story brought to life!",

      "content": "Going into an 'Oscar baity' film during the Oscars winter season is always an experiment: is this going to be one that will allow you to fully immerse yourself into the fibre of the story or will you be severely frustrated by all the tearyGoing into an 'Oscar baity' film during the Oscars winter season is always an experiment: is this going to be one that will allow you to fully immerse yourself into the fibre of the story or will you be severely frustrated by all the teary closeups followed by the string score?Lion, for better of for worse, does both. The first half of the film is absolutely splendid. Raw, poignant, emotional. It has it all. A fabulous lead actor in the young Sunny Pawar and a heart-wrenching story to go with him. Things go a bit wonky once the film shifts time and place to Australia. While Dev Patel is splendid here, after Sunny's performance, it is difficult for him to live up to what has been presented. Rooney Mara is excellent, albeit rather tangential (potentially, actually unnecessary as a character). And that is where the problems lie. That strained relationship they have is just not meshing well. It does not progress the story anywhere. There are glimmers of hope in that Australian section, though. The dinner scene when Patel's character has a fit and Nicole Kidman, playing his adoptive mother, has one of the most expressive 30 second performances seen in a long time. Her \"big scene\" is also quite good but was too much of a tear-jerker moment for my taste. From the technical side - the cinematography is excellent (again, especially in the first part of the film), and the original score is mesmerising and gives a wholly new dimension to the film. The bottom line is that this film is all well-intentioned, and that is the problem probably with it. It veers on the edge of being fully committed to the story and characters, but then kind of drifts away to be \"a film\". Basically, it is overly obvious and cliche at times. And I bet that the real-life story was not a cliche at all. The film just does not fully realise itself as an excellent one. A good film, definitely. A very good film, surely. But not an excellent one.",

      "content": "Going into watching Lion, I expected a cliched feel good film. I expected it to be overly manipulative and, while a solid film, nothing particularly special. My expectations were misguided, however. A powerful, spiritual, and lyrical journeyGoing into watching Lion, I expected a cliched feel good film. I expected it to be overly manipulative and, while a solid film, nothing particularly special. My expectations were misguided, however. A powerful, spiritual, and lyrical journey to find one's own identity, Lion is a film that snuck up on me, but left me in absolute ruins. The power of this film is not to be understated as Lion is a film that never ceases to be powerful and emotionally impactful. It discards the cliches, develops characters, and is a film whose emotional power is well earned and never manipulative. For a feature-length debut for director Garth Davis, Lion is a film with incredible strength, gravitas, and a film that is a full-fledged drama that shows the potential of feel-good cinema.Refusing to be bottled into cliches, Lion is a film that finds power from the very beginning. Set in India, young Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is lost on a train and winds up 1,600 KM away from home. Home, a very small place in rural India, is the polar opposite in terms of language and build than Calcutta, which is where he winds up. Dodging child traffickers and abuse left and right, this sequence not only highlights Saroo's journey, but the journey of other children. As the epilogue describes, 80,000 Indian children go missing each year. This journey to Calcutta experienced by Saroo highlights the abominable conditions of homeless children in India. Heartbreakingly enough, there are a large number of them he encounters who are rounded up by nefarious characters. Even in the orphanage, the treatment is horrendous. However, Saroo's life is changed when he is adopted by John (David Menham) and Sue (Nicole Kidman). An Australian couple, Sue had a vision that she would adopt an Indian child and, sure enough, she turned her vision into a reality with Saroo. In his portrayal of Saroo, Sunny Pawar is brilliant. Obviously, he is adorable. But, he never seems to be acting. This feels like his life and one that he is familiar with, even subconsciously. Pawar cannot be older than five or so, but he is phenomenal in this film and gives a natural performance for a film that demands one. His confusion and authenticity lends the film considerable gravity, but so does the introduction of his adoptive brother Mantosh. Adopted by John and Sue a year after Saroo, Mantosh is broken. Whatever happened to him and whatever he saw has left him shattered internally, constantly hitting himself when he is upset. Though this is a film about Saroo finding his birth parents, weight is given to Mantosh's role in the film. Highlighting just how lucky Saroo was to escape his circumstances unscathed, Mantosh is a sobering adult. He stays away from his parents and Saroo because he knows how bad he is, which is heartbreaking. Divian Ladwa is brilliant in this relatively small role and makes the most of this broken man. The film, after initially showing Saroo getting used to life in Australia, jumps ahead to Saroo as an adult (Dev Patel). Dating Lucy (Rooney Mara), the duo \"meet cute\", but that is not hard when Rooney Mara is in the film. Together, Patel and Mara have insatiable chemistry and the two work terrifically well together. Rising above the classic cliche of leaving Lucy as just Saroo's girlfriend with no grit of her own, Lion ensures that it is clear Lucy has a life of her own. She has her own emotions, passions, and interests. Suddenly, however, these diverge when Saroo becomes obsessed with finding his birth parents. Though perhaps going on for too long, Saroo's descent into anger, resentment, and panic as he searches fervently on Google Earth for any clue as to where his family could be. He resents himself for not finding them sooner and can only imagine the pain and anguish felt by his mother. The film is incredibly somber in these moments, punctuated by the score by Hauschka and Dustin O'Halloran. Nominated for Best Original Score, the score may be a bit too noticeable at times, but it is brilliantly orchestrated in spite of that concern.However, the moment we are all waiting for is Saroo finding his birth mother. The moment is chilling. It is one of the most powerful scenes put in a film all year. Yes, it is manipulative. Yes, it is sentimental. But dammit, I almost cried. I had to fight back the tears to be able to still watch. The look on his mother's face, the embrace, her hand running through his hair and on his face, the little peck on the forehead Saroo gives her, UGH. I was in ruins. There is no way to deny this film's power in this moment. It may be manipulative and something out of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition after Ty Pennington shouts, \"Move. That. Bus!\", but man is it ever effective. It is a sequence that has anticipation, power, and one where director Garth Davis steps back and allows us to feel the full power of the moment. Yet, he is not done making my eyes wage war on the tears.",

The strongest section of this movie is our following Sunny Pawar, heavy subject matter, layered, detailed and these scenes have drive behind them. Not that the second half was poor, but it lacked depth. The pace picked up quickly and the feel to this side was thin. Rooney Mara's character felt as if she was just in the movie because she is in the real world life of Saroo. And you can only stretch Google Earth so far in movie format. My last quibble with the movie is the cinematography. With the locales and places depicted in the film there were so many chances for the cinematography to shine, for the watcher to be awed by the diversity shown on the screen and the beauty of these places. I was left wanting. It was serviceable but not a wowing experience. That being said, this is a feel-good movie and it accomplishes this in spades, both with young and old Saroo. It accomplishes what it set out to do in the end, with a few hiccups along the way.",

The story is important and once again (after Slumdog) it gives us an idea of how it is like to belong to the poor clash in India. That first part of the film lasts almost until the middle, which is how it should be order to make the viewer be able to put themselves in the position if these children, at least have an idea. Then we get to know the family and many things that come with adoption. As expected Nicole Kidman nails it as the new mother. But especial kudos to the leading actor, who has the charisma to carry any film in my opinion. All the cast is great and you´ll be involved with the story no doubt. I don´t give it more than a 7 because somehow the film is not new and doesn´t have the creativity and art something like Moonlight posesses for example.

The best way to describe it is that it’s an extraordinary true story of a lost child in India, who, after being adopted by Australian parents, yearns to learn where he came from.  He remembers that he fell asleep on a train after being separated from his brother, however, the place where he came from doesn’t exist, according to everyone who he talks to and he searches heavily to find his way home.  My description hasn’t really done the story justice, but I didn’t want to go into too much detail since I think it’s best to go in an experience it yourself.  The film has an extraordinary first half which feels really organic and really gives the story what it deserves.  The second half doesn’t quite match up to that and becomes very ‘Oscar baity’ for a lack of a better term.  It does feel like Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman are aiming for those Oscar nominations.  They are very good performances and I don’t object to them getting an Oscar nomination, but you know those performances, where you can feel it’s the award season.  It’s a very good story and if you don’t want to see the film or the trailer doesn’t appeal to you I would recommend picking up the book, written by the actual person who the film is based on which tells of his story, however, I will not give away the title for this book, since just looking up the title, actually gives away the films ending.  I liked Lion, but I think it could have been better.  I would say give it a chance, I suspect I am being just a bit too critical of it.",

Unfortunately I have to say that as a movie I'm not too impressed with Lion. The pacing of the film I think is its main problem, because you can't get too emotionally invested in the characters before you are making a jump to another thing. The first part of the movie as a child is actually much better at this, but the second half feels a little incomplete. Perhaps with a few more minutes added the pacing may have been improved, but as it is I didn't connect to deeply with the plot or the characters, nor it let me appreciate the quality of their acting. Nevertheless, the movie does have good points, as I said the story is very nice tale, and Dev Patel sells it nicely enough. In conclusion, Lion is a solid movie that tells you a \"feel good\" story, but it loses itself in parts with its meh pacing. Recommended only if you enjoy the type of story. Final Verdict: 6.7",

Gripping acting from young Sunny Pawar (Saroo), his looks, his runs, his sleeps in nowhere. Attractive acting from Dev Patel (adult Saroo), and from Nicole Kidman the adoptive mother, and David Wenham the adoptive father who faced with courage the will of Saroo to search for his family and origin. Nothing is wrong in this movie. Music, scenario, photography, directing, no single minute is nonsense. I didn't see such an attracting meaningful movie for long.

LION is a classic story of a young Indian boy who is tragically separated from his mother only to try and track her down years later, after he is adopted and relocated to Australia. It's the story of one who is trying to reconcile a tragic past with the person he has now become. Somewhat fantastically, but true, he uses Google Earth and his memory to locate his hometown.

It is a true story that starts in  1986 when we meet five year old Saroo (Sunny Pawar) and his older brother (Abhishek Bharate) in a“Lion” is a first rate, sentimental, emotional, ‘small’ movie that will move even the coldest hearted person. It is a true story that starts in  1986 when we meet five year old Saroo (Sunny Pawar) and his older brother (Abhishek Bharate) in a poor province of India where their mother (Priyanke Bose) earns what money she can hauling rocks. The boys help by bringing in any money they can earning it in any way they can including stealing coal off trains so they can exchange it for milk. One evening the boys are separated and we see Saroo falling asleep on a decommissioned train finding himself lost and in Calcutta almost a thousand miles away from where he lives.The first part of the film follows young Saroo, as he tries to survive, with director Garth Davis and screenwriter Luke Davies not shying away from those who prey on children. (In the credits at the end it states that 80,000 children in India go missing every year, many to sex traffickers, to this day).Going into the second part of the film it is 20 years later and Saroo, now played by Dev Patel, lives in Tasmania, an island State off Australia, having been adopted by Sue and John Brierly (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham). He goes to Melbourne to study hotel management and meets Lucy (Rooney Mara) from America, they become lovers and at school they meet and become friends with other Indians. It is through these meetings that Saroo develops a need to search for his long lost mother, brother and very young sister who he has never forgotten.To tell any further would mean spoilers and I don’t go there.Up until 1961 the Oscar awards had a special category for any Juvenile performers who gave a strong performance. If the category was still given this year two young actors would fight it out with 8 year old Sunny Pawar playing a 5 year old in “Lion” versus Alex R. Hibburt, a 12 year old, playing 9 year old Chiron.Dev Patel does a superb job as the older Saroo having to show a lot of his feelings with his face instead of talking. Divian Ladwa plays another child adopted by the Brierley’s who isn’t able to adjust to the new life presented to him after being traumatized in his earlier life.David Wenham and Rooney Mara do what they can with what they have to work with while Nicole Kidman has two extended scenes that had many audience members trying to hide their tears!Cinematographer Greig Frasier will certainly be responsible for a big rise in tourism to Tasmania with some of the scenes breath taking as is some of the aerial shots of the mountains and waters in India.This is director Garth Davis’s first feature movie and doesn’t overdo tugging of the heartstrings which the screenplay by Luke Davies is quite effective in just telling the story as it happened.The soundtrack by Dustin O’Halloran and Hausckha is a definite plus.Be sure to stay for the ending credits as it not only explains why the movie is called “Lion” plus pictures of the real people highlighted in the film.",

Also starring: Dev Patel as boy as an adult, Nicole Kidman and David Wenham as his new parents, Rooney Mara, Diwian Ladwa. Based on a true story which was turned into book, written by the boy himself, and now a movie.I liked \"Lion\" a lot, for the most part it's gripping and packs a strong emotional punch. But the two-hour story as a whole is uneven, losing steam during its last quarter and – even worse – starting manipulating with the audience in unconvincing way.This big shift doesn't kill the movie but the whole experience would win if adult Saroo's journey was compressed into shorter period of time. As it is, the last quarter is not quite compatible with the previous hour and a half and ends up killing the mood that has been masterfully built up and maintained almost from the start. The adult cast offers impressive performances during that last quarter which is totally worth the awards recognition it has garnered. I am especially glad to see Nicole Kidman and Rooney Mara getting strong, well-written female characters and thus turning in more interesting work as usual for them.But the movie makers could have easily shortened the adult Saroo's detective work part which really bogs the story down and seems to be more of an excuse to show Patel hanging around aimlessly. He'd still have enough screen time for all those stronger acting scenes with the girlfriend and family, or just showing off his fab new looks. Watch out, girls and manlovers, he's turned into quite a heartbreaker indeed, wild hair and strong body, and all...\"The mood that has been masterfully built up and maintained almost from the start\", as mentioned above, is the main reason why \"Lion\" turns out to be such a moving journey. The director uses as little dialogue and talking as possible, concentrating on just showing this lost little boy wandering around – sometimes enhancing the events with not too intrusive music. The environment becomes a character of its own – alien, dirty, sometimes hostile. Watching this little guy just trying to get by, without trying to make him „act“, or remind us to feel something, gives the story a lot of poetic power and unexpected dimension of depth. Sadly they are unable to repeat or resuscitate this feeling later on, although Patel gives an strong performance of his own, as stated above.Interestingly, 2008's \"Slumdog Millionaire\" – Dev Patel's breakthrough hit which also shows the shadow side of India and its childrens' lives – is also a movie of two halves, the first of which excites a lot and the second kind of kills the buzz. So, it's a great movie for the first three quarters and just okay after that.\"Lion\" is one of the frontrunners during this award season, with 60 nominations and 32 wins already under the belt. It's nominated for 6 Oscars: movie, adapted screenplay, supporting actor (Patel) and actress (Kidman), cinematography and music. Was also nominated for four Golden Globes but did not win any.",

It made me want to travel, cry, write, and live. Dev Patel carries an incredibly vibrant performance of the true story of Saroo Brierley, who was lost as a child and then attempts to find his family in his 20’s. Pair that with grand sweeping landscapes and the incredibly endearing Sunny Pawar, who shines despite the grit of 1980’s slums of India, and it had everything I could have wanted in a hauntingly true film. This movie stuck with me days after leaving the theater and only deepened the lifelong crush I have been harboring on Dev Patel (which started in Slumdog and escalated in The Newsroom). I am in general pretty lukewarm on Nicole Kidman, but this is her at her best, and her maternal interactions seemed authentic without being romanticized. All in all, this was near perfect to me, and somehow managed to avoid landmine clichés that could have cheapened this standout of 2016. 9.7/10",

The result of the adapted indieEighty-thousand children go missing each year in India. Saroo Brierley, author of the autobiography, “A Long Way Home,” was one, and he tells about his incredible journey from India to Australia and back again. The result of the adapted indie drama, Lion, is a well-intended attempt which utilizes a “been there, done that” approach to prove how the community can pitch in to help families across the globe.Sure enough, being a depressingly heartwarming weepie, Lion starts on a heartbreaking note. Saroo as an adorable little five-year-old oversleeps and loses his way in a dark train station, separated from his older brother. He hops onto a train and arrives at another station far away, and sees no options available other than to sleep on cardboard with other lost kids. The stay gets cut short though, as several kidnappers force him out. He then comes across new parts of India’s culture he never knew existed beyond his mother’s work as a rock-hauler. A hospitable Hindu couple helps Saroo out until he runs away out of desperation. Soon, with hopes of locating his parents, an orphanage takes him in, where beatings occur daily.Eye-swelling in these first moments are guaranteed while watching a vulnerable little tike lose his innocence before reaching his full development of memory cells. When also considering how everyone in India speaks in their native tongue with English subtitles, an extra step authenticates the true story. However I must admit: the boy cast as Saroo, Sunny Pawar, acts precisely how any young actor would in his first role. Nobody cheers him on because of his talent, but because of his cuteness.A kind Australian couple eventually adopts Saroo, with some English lessons included to help him with the transition. As investing as it all feels, the very next event is, “20 years later.” So did nothing interesting happen within twenty years? This sort of leap in time happens constantly throughout the picture, limiting the story possibilities and minimizing Saroo’s motives of returning to India. So proof exists in why Lion would prefer to tug on your heartstrings over structuring the story to deserve the countless awards it campaigned so hard for.Speaking of awards, my complements go to the Academy Award nominated performances of Nicole Kidman (The Hours, Moulin Rouge!) and Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire). Both portrayals standout satisfactorily well, carrying the second half of the film to maintain the audiences’ tears. Although I ought to complain about Kidman’s distractingly obvious wig. Yes, I realize they needed to cast a talented actress, and yes, I understand she needs to look like the real-life counterpart, so why not cast someone whose natural hair looks like the real life counterpart? Or maybe dye Kidman’s hair? Oh, right. They needed an already nominated actress to guarantee a nomination, and she has to still look pretty in her natural silky blonde hair for those expensive interviews and campaigns.Yet like any other Oscar-bait picture, the production crew still put in tremendous effort. Saroo’s growth into manhood blooms to life through various scenic shots meant to highlight memories of home, such as moths illuminated by the sun, or the infinite route of a railroad track. Then as things turn more personal and distanced from youth, the camera pulls in closer to the human face. The minds and hearts of everyone involved were in the right place, even if Lion turns out no different in quality than the summer released indie crowd-pleaser.Clearly, Lion will fall out of the public’s memory after the 2017 Oscars ceremony. But the #LionHeart campaign it started will last much longer. It exists to raise donations to benefit the 80,000 lost children in India, and worldwide. I encourage you to offer them a small donation; even just a little can travel a long ways to make a difference.",

I couldn't completely engage with the film as a result.Nearly an hour of the film is spent on little Saroo, yet ultimately this has no bearing on the film as a whole. The film is about Saroo reconnecting with his biological mom, his culture and his heritage. Yet none of these scenes further that. They're from a different movie about the entire life of Saroo and the tribulations of all Indian orphans which this film clearly is not.I really think this film benefits from a less chronological structure - if his past as a young boy were something he was remembering in pieces in the present. Because ultimately how much of that time does he really remember? It seems unlikely it was all of it since he was so young, so these scenes are really for the benefit of the audience so we spend too much of the film waiting for him to find home because we aren't actively connecting with his past like he is. We already know what happened and the incoming inevitable conclusion.Still, it's a beautiful story and the conclusion is convincingly emotional and touching.

The evolution of the protagonist appears to be upside down; when he is a kid is forced to face the reality, give up childhood dreams and start living independently but when he is an adult he is lost, he doesn’t know what decisions to make, because of the uncertainty of a home as a reference spot he cannot have stable human relationships. The performances of Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman and Rooney Mara are marvelous, but Sunny Pawar as young Saroo is brilliant.

I think Nicole Kidman didn't deserve the nomination. The main flaw throughout the movie was the pacing. The movie became very boring towards the end of little Saroo's run home. I wish this movie could have been better. Amazing story though.",

The 2nd hour casts Dav Patel in the role as the grownup version, who's adopted by an Australian couple and ultimately decides to seek his missing family. Both segments have moments of compelling drama and beautiful cinematography. They also both go on too long: the hopeless despair in India and the mental torment in Australia. Despite engrossing performances and a remarkable story (yes, it's true), this film is in desperate need of major trimming to minimize the anguish and maximize the emotional impact.",

Saroo is a man who, despite being well-accomplished and well-mannered, finds himself obsessed with trying to find his original family. Lion is well-acted and is as heart-breaking as it is heart-warming. I found it riveting from start to finish, it's a very memorable movie.",

NotLost in India, found in Australia!Based on the book 'A Long Way Home' that tells the story of a young Indian boy who lost his brother in a railway station in the night and the next morning he woke up thousands kilometers away from home. Not knowing the language or the address and the names of his family, he struggled from various threats in the society. After that he got adopted from an Australian family and the rest of the film revolved on his true identity. Haunted by his past, how he rediscovered his originality was emotionally told.Very impressive film. The families should not miss it. Even though it is a must see by all ages. I am not a big fan of Dev's performances, even in his debut film 'Slumdog Millionaire'. After that success, he had survived in the film industry doing decent roles, for like a decade. But it was 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' that changed his career. For the first time I liked him very much in that, and again he was pretty impressive in this. The second best performance in his career. Though his part comes only after the half way mark. Yet in that one hour, he did great, particularly in the sentiments.I was wondering why it was called 'Lion'. And I got answered only just before the end credit. So you should be patient to learn why, if you are yet to see it. It was not until the 90s the India began to see a real change. This story takes place in the mid 80s, only the opening half and those parts were raw and cruel, especially in the eyes of an 8 year old boy. That kid was so good. Just like Jacom Tremblay, a year before who impressed us with his performance from the film 'Room'.It was a feature film debut for the director and he was wonderful in this attempt. The film splits into two, the first half was about lost and the following half is about finding the road back to the home. Less dialogues, but well written in those necessary parts. The music was good. Only negative was the film was out of depth. Yeah, all the events were like fast forward. If they had focused on details, the narration would have reached at least 3 hours. Especially I wanted the Australian mother's perspective on how she went through to raise those kids.Now I'm waiting for the 2020. I mean 2008 was SDM, 2012 was LoP and 2016 was this one. The 4 years later, surely there will be another India related western film would come. Despite this film nominated for the 6 Oscars, it had won nothing. That's very sad. Overall, I strongly suggest it. One of the best films of the Year.9/10",

It's emotionally gripping and beautifully shot. The second half of the film when he's in Tasmania is super underdeveloped. Despite some heavy hitters showing up, the only character we have any sort of attachment to is Dev Patel's character (blanking on the name here). They don't flesh out Rooney Mara's character at all. The way they flesh out Nicole Kidman only serves to make me hate wealthy white people. She has an \"emotional\" scene where she's crying and basically tells Dev Patel, \"I adopted you to make myself feel better for adopting a brown boy and now you're not making me feel better.\" The closing scene is nicely done, but isn't enough to rectify the damage done over the majority of the second half of the film.",

I felt that the direction and writing of the movie was not thought out properly by the screen play writers and editors. It fells like there was a lot of ellipsis editing. I didn't like that in the beginning the first act was rushed leading you to the second act immediately. In only the first ten minutes, you are introduced to Saroo and immediately immersed into the character being lost. It felt like there wasn’t much focused on his life growing up, Were was his father? . did he die when Saroo was born did he leave him after his sister was born. The editors and screen writers failed to show how close of a relationship he even had with his mother or sister. U feel as if there is so much missing from beginning sequences that were shot, that you couldn’t see how much of a person Saroo is. This is based off of a true story .Not a character that we’re supposed to feel for written by some writer who had an idea about a boy who gets lost from his parents . All this led me to not feel any connections to Saroo, of feel any sympathy when he got separated from his family. as I stated we do not know much about his family and culture which made the character feel a bit unlikable. we know he's a good boy who helps his mother but it is un realistic that he seems to be very well adjusted to being lost in a city for a 5-year-old. The character does not know where he is, can’t speak the same language yet adjusted fine. I love that Although clearly struggling he has shown to be wise and independent despite being so young. This is not the case threw out the hole movie3 as the character dose develop into a more likable and relatable person. However it did not make the ending sconce any more satisfying and emotionally reliving. when he reunites with his family it feels hollow at first but due to the acting the screen play writers you don’t feel that you miss the family just as much as he did and you are glad that they are finally together again. Over all the hole journey feels manipulative as if you are only told that you should feel sorry for Saroo and that you should want him to reunite with his family.The lighting in this movie is spectacular. The film crew and editors have gone above and beyond to capture the true essence of this movie. after Saroo got lost, the colors in the film were dull, they became dark grays that were panning into pure darkness. Demonstrating lifeless symbolization of Saroo’s feelings of loneliness, hopelessness and depressive fears. Once Saroo was adopted the cinematography and coloring effects were changed completely, it went from being dull to bright and colourful. It was great how realistic and angelic it was when the sun shined on Nicole Kidman as they bring Saroo home in the car.The camera work and editing is what made this film. Its so well done that it is almost indescribable. The director films so smoothly and creates a child's perspective, by setting the camera at the hero's shoulder level . this makes it seem as if u are walking around with Saroo, as he wanders around the city. As the camera zooms in slowly to his feet and pans out ahead, u feel like with every step he takes your beside him watching over him. I felt like his brother still beside him on their journey together. however, it didn’t help make the journey any more traumatizing. I enjoyed the scene were Saroo runs through the tunnel. the camera is positioned at eye level to show his vulnerability. The camera angels are smoothly panned out to other sense making it seem like they are from a child’s point of view. You can definitely experience the fear of being a small child.You can tell they put a lot effort into researching the cultural life of India. The makeup artists and designers created a realistic view of how life is in India. Everything seemed so life like from the busy people at the train station to the scene where he prayed before taking the apple. Though The movie Lion has bad direction, it’s strong use of cinematography, lightning and music gives enough emotional weight to the story for me to recommend watching this movie.",
