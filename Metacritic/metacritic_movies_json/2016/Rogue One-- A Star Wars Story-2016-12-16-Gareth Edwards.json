  "summary": "In a time of conflict, a group of unlikely heroes band together on a mission to steal the plans to the Death Star, the Empire’s ultimate weapon of destruction. This key event in the Star Wars timeline brings together ordinary people who choose to do extraordinary things, and in doing so, become part of something greater than themselves.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Rogue One might trade heavily in nostalgia but it's bold enough to take risks, and will leave you stirred, fired up and raring for more. Now, if only there was a follow-up we could go away and watch immediately…",
    "It stands alone as the best \"Star Wars\" entry since 1980's \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" Yes, it's that good.",
    "Perhaps the darkest, most action-packed Star Wars instalment, director Gareth Edwards’ standalone adventure establishes its own rhythm, balancing fan demands with grand, poetic moments unlike anything this cinematic galaxy has previously achieved.",
    "Rogue One spins “Star Wars” into a whole new orbit.",
    "Rogue One is a letdown in other areas, and there are creative decisions so ill-conceived they take you out of the story. But somehow these aren't enough to sink the movie, which manages to succeed as both super-nerdy fan service and the first entry since the 1977 original that will satisfy people who have never seen a \"Star Wars\" film.",
    "This is a very “Star Wars”-y “Star Wars” movie. It’s not quite on the level of the original or “The Empire Strikes Back” (the best of ’em all, of course), but it’s on a par with last year’s “The Force Awakens” and it’s light years above “Attack of the Clones” and “The Phantom Menace.”",
    "With the smashing Jones giving us a female warrior to rank with the great ones and a cast that knows how to keep it real even in a sci-fi fantasy, Rogue One proves itself a Star Wars story worth telling.",
    "Rogue One would have been a very good stand-alone sci-fi movie if it came out under a different name. But what makes it especially exciting is how it perfectly snaps right into the Star Wars timeline and connects events we already know by heart with ones that we never even considered.",
    "Rogue One is a very good “Star Wars” film, frustratingly though, it falls short of being a truly great one.",
    "The film soars when it abandons all pretense of being a space opera, and fully embraces the bombastic modern action movie that’s at its core, giving it a unique identity that does indeed stand apart from other entries in the series.",
    "A minor miracle in and of itself, Edwards' Rogue One somehow delivers on almost all of its weighty pre-release promises whilst at the same time besting The Force Awakens for sheer spectacle and world-building.",
    "This is an imperfect film, bold but occasionally baffling, and one that in its final act grows into something much more exciting than you might initially expect.",
    "Rogue One stands on its own, an entry that is at once part of the “Star Wars” franchise (obviously) but also separate – a tougher, grittier film.",
    "The ultimate Star Wars fan film, it’s short on whimsy but when it gets going there’s enough risk-taking and spectacle to bode well for future standalones.",
    "What fans will get here is loads of action, great effects, good comic relief, stunning locations (Iceland, Jordan and the Maldives) and some intriguing early glimpses of the Galactic Empire as it begins to flex its inter-galactic power.",
    "But in its best moments, there’s a yarn-spinning intimacy to it too – an old war story told around a spectacular campfire.",
    "This is another really entertaining fantasy with fan-fiction energy and attack.",
    "It starts off slow and somewhat clunky, but by the time the mind-blowing third act arrives, it’s all a fan can do not to stand up and cheer.",
    "Rogue One is a better movie than The Force Awakens - something that elevates it considerably over its “secondary” designation.",
    "By the time its credits rolled, I was ready to forgive Rogue One any imperfections. Its last 10 minutes are spectacular and dark, with a final flourish that should give any “Star Wars” fan goose bumps — and a new hope that the next main installment will be this good.",
    "It has undeniable weaknesses: an underwritten protagonist, a generic villain, a shortage of interesting personalities. (No knock against the large cast, which is mostly very good, but underused.) But in many other respects, it is a better film than last year’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens: leaner, darker, with a distinct visual style and an actual ending that feels like a denial of blockbuster expectations simply because it shows basic narrative integrity.",
    "The action sequences, both on the ground and in space, are rousingly staged. But the losses incurred in those sequences are sobering. The stakes in the “Star Wars” rebellion are high indeed.",
    "Rogue One will engage such diehards but making new friends for the brand is unlikely.",
    "I do wish Felicity Jones’ character popped the way Daisy Ridley’s did in last year’s franchise offering. “The Force Awakens,” directed by J.J. Abrams, was smooth, consistent, even-toned, nostalgic. Rogue One zigzags, and it’s more willfully jarring. Yet it takes time for callbacks and shout-outs to characters we’ve seen before, and we’ll see again. And again. And again.",
    "It’s almost wholly satisfying — witty, warm and entertaining — a film in which fatalism isn’t a joke, where pitiless death is doled out by Empire and Rebellion, where those deaths have weight and meaning, where suspense is genuine.",
    "The movie didn’t rekindle the thrill of seeing, say, The Empire Strikes Back, but Rogue One will loom pretty large in the Star Wars galaxy — if only because there’s so little competition.",
    "By breaking some of the rules, Rogue One has made itself the first movie since The Empire Strikes Back to redefine the boundaries of what a Star Wars movie can be. The Force Awakens may have reanimated the once-dormant franchise, but it’s Rogue One that will give Star Wars fans a new hope.",
    "A swiftly paced, rough-and-ready entertainment that, in anticipating the canonical events of “A New Hope,” manages the tricky feat of seeming at once casually diverting and hugely consequential.",
    "Director Gareth Edwards has finally made the first “Star Wars” movie for grown-ups.",
    "Rogue One makes up for a shaky first act by punching into overdrive for an outstanding third act battle sequence that overwhelms in scale and intensity.",
    "With all the aerial dogfights, armored combat vehicles, grenades, flame-throwers and snipers, Rogue One feels like a film for those who think that most Star Wars movies are insufficiently like World War II flicks. Or maybe that they should more closely resemble computer games.",
    "The cast does good work, despite a less-than-great screenplay.",
    "By no stretch is this a disaster on a par with Lucas’s misbegotten prequel trilogy. Still, at least until its final section, Rogue One lacks the zip, zing and exhilarating sense of return to form that “The Force Awakens” conveyed so lightly.",
    "Rogue One is often undermined by its close ties to George Lucas’ original trilogy, and more emphasis is put on its central mission than its fresh-faced characters.",
    "Rogue One is less the fetish object that The Force Awakens is because it at least has the ambitions to create its own character dynamics and plot routes rather than coast on existing ones.",
    "Edwards is very good at crafting images that straddle the uncomfortable line between beauty and horror, and at dwarfing people with giant monsters and machines with powers beyond mortal comprehension. It’s his comprehension of mortals that sometimes feels lacking.",
    "Action is Rogue One’s strongest suit, and what makes all the faffing about bearable.",
    "For a film that’s all about hope and rebellion, it’s kind of ironic how it’s such a conflicted mess in and of itself. The Force should have been stronger with this one.",
    "Not only is “Rogue One” the rare modern blockbuster that could have afforded to risk something real, it’s the rare modern blockbuster that gave itself a genuine responsibility to do so. And yet, for all of its excitement and occasional splendor, there’s nothing the least bit rebellious about it. It could have been special, instead it’s just… forced.",
    "The story hits every expected beat, right when you expect it to. And it squanders some of its best resources.",
    "Plots and subplots are handled with clumsy expediency, and themes that might connect this movie with the larger Lucasfilm mythos aren’t allowed to develop. You’re left wanting both more and less.",
    "Rogue One is a minor little story with a likable cast and familiar Star Wars themes. But it tries so hard to be an epic masterpiece – with self-important speeches and an insanely outsize orchestral score –  that it ends up a laughable parody of itself.",
    "Only Tudyk’s dry humour in the role of the tactless droid K-2S0 makes Edwards’s darkly reductivist approach occasionally seem smarter rather than lesser. In the end, this hardening of the franchise seems likely to alienate both the fans and the uninitiated.",
    "Rogue One's creators clearly want to move us deeply — several major plot developments should pack an overwhelming emotional wallop — but they haven’t given this talented cast enough to work with. It’s fast, loud, even lovely — and not terribly engaging.",
    "The good news about Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the first in a planned series of stand-alone movies set in the “Star Wars” universe, is that the last half-hour of the film is a sustained stretch of rousing action, indelible images and cliffhanger thrills. It’s pop sci-fi bliss...The bad news about Rogue One is that getting to the good stuff is a slog — and the movie is pretty long.",
    "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is for the fans, all right, but in that expression’s worst way.",
    "Edwards and the screenwriters have designed Rogue One around applause breaks for cameos and callbacks. We’ve all lost the point of the franchise. Audiences once packed theaters to gawk at the future; now, it’s to soak in the past.",
    "The fault lies not with Ms. Jones, an appealing performer, but with Gareth Edwards, who directed doggedly from a delight-free script by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy.",
    "“Star Wars” movies have been dazzling, infuriating, heartbreaking, silly, witty, convoluted, gripping and overblown. But until Rogue One: A Star Wars story, I don’t think “dull” was the most appropriate adjective.",
    "The director of Rogue One, Gareth Edwards, has stepped into a mythopoetic stew so half-baked and overcooked, a morass of pre-instantly overanalyzed implications of such shuddering impact to the series’ fundamentalists, that he lumbers through, seemingly stunned or constrained or cautious to the vanishing point of passivity, and lets neither the characters nor the formidable cast of actors nor even the special effects, of which he has previously proved himself to be a master, come anywhere close to life.",
    "It’s a downer. It’s morally tangled. The characters are as depressed as the scenario, and Michael Giacchino’s music can’t make it better."

It's a fun and more grittier adventure to the galaxy far, far away.Rogue One; like all the SW-premieres are always a fun event to experience. Fans and non-fans alike collectively get togetherThis is rebellion on a whole new (epic) level. It's a fun and more grittier adventure to the galaxy far, far away.Rogue One; like all the SW-premieres are always a fun event to experience. Fans and non-fans alike collectively get together once again for this space adventure. It's visually a big upgrade from the prequels, and it does to a certain point manage to embrace the original film's charisma. Fun, bright and enjoyable characters is a big trace -- and forget romance! This is a pure war film where companionship is everything. We follow 'Jyn Erso' and the main story is greatly focused on her, but a major letdown is the underdeveloped side-characters. They are all well presented and we get some inside to their personalities; but there's no major background nor development to characters like 'Cassian Andor'. Our main antagonist 'Orson Krennic' is very much the same. But there are some deeper layers to him, but sadly not enough to be considered a complex nor memorable villain. Because of this lack of greater depth to characters; the few emotional moments that does exist could have been even greater, because there are some great ones. The great one-liners from K-2SO is on the other hand very much appreciated, it's great that they really understand the importance of humor in the SW universe.The story that takes place is full of action, as expected -- but more importantly; the characters are the major players here. A great character-filled first act, a more passive & calmer second act, to a stunning and perhaps too massive third act -- that's Rogue One. There're many characters and places involved in this story. All of this made some of the story uneven. It kept going, from places to places, characters to characters and so on; it became an experience that's a bit too far- stretched. It lost that \"wow-factor\". The second act takes a step back and didn't impress me on a personal level. It's okay but nothing really impressive got to me. But I am confident enough to say to all the big SW-fans out there that you will definitely love this film, and yes there are some really impressive action pieces -- but I never got many \"wow moments\". It drags on and lacks a greater long-term stamina when it comes to action. When looking at the CGI; it's a major technological achievement, except for two major CGI characters that look all other than alive. They are impressive to look at; much details, but the way they interact and talk is so fake. Add a non- Williams score that's underwhelming, well the flick got flaws. But other than that I really enjoyed it!It's a good Star Wars movie. Not the best nor the worst. It got its flaws concerning the uneven storytelling and undeveloped side-characters, and some flaws are more serious than other. It's a beautiful story that's partially gritty and it got a stunning visualization of Vader. Add a darker tone, a very satisfying finale and an ending that manages to wrap everything together! That's Rogue One. It's the pure definition of rebellion.*psst don't enter this film expecting much Vader.Personal rating: 82/100 Critical rating: 70/100",

Luckily, Gareth Edwards directs 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story', a title that might put-off some fans, but the movie itself is definitely worth a watch. We meet a young girl named Jyn (Felicity Jones) who had to escape after her father, Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) is informed by Director Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) forces Galen to work on the crafting of the Death Star. After some decade and a half, Jyn meets Rebel Officer Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and she is informed about the Death Star.She also meets a droid named K-2SO (a very funny Alan Tudyk) whose mannerisms and personality seem unusual, but helpful. They travel from planet to planet to find more clues on how to get the plans to destroy the Death Star, and they also find more characters to come and help. There is so much of this movie to talk about, but a \"Star Wars\" review can be easily spoiled, so I'm just going to summarize my thoughts on the movie. This is a really steady paced, dark and thrilling movie. The third act is one of the best third acts in any \"Star Wars\" movie, ever. The war battle that rages reminded me of the opening battle scene in 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998), obviously not that violent, but for this franchise's standards, it is. There are many familiar faces that return in this movie, most notably, Darth Vader (reprising the voice of James Earl Jones), who only makes two small appearances in this movie. But, they are so great, I cannot elaborate further without spoiling it, so I'll leave it there. This movie, which takes place before the events of 'Star Wars: A New Hope' (1977), really relies mostly on story as opposed to character. You get to know a lot about Jyn, a little bit about Cassian and K-2SO... but the rest are kind of glossed over as far as development goes. Director Gareth Edwards did a capable job of actually making this feel like a \"War\" movie, whereas the other movies were a space-opera spectacle. The first two acts are a little pacey here and there... but that third act is truly one of the best highlights for this entire franchise.",

Some of the scenes in Rogue One are some of the best I've ever seen in a Star Wars film. The beginning of the movie however, is muddled and lacks focus. There are too many characters with not enough development, and too many things happening to really get your teeth into. While the second half of the film will blow audiences away, the first feels a little clunky and the re-shooting seems obvious as you watch.Although it has a shaky start, the film is definitely worth watching, especially for Star Wars fans.

The direction feels very different at first, feeling more handheld at not super Star Wars-esque because of its grittier more grounded style, but this is great and works for the film. It ends up making it feel like a real war and struggle for the rebellion and it ends up changing later towards the end in tonal shift and direction to blend into A New Hope.Pacing is a little odd at first, but the first section is interesting enough to keep you very invested, especially with all the character introductions. The second act is a littler quieter and a bit of a lull but still has enough going on and differs itself from the rest of the film to keep it fresh. The last section is an intense all out action masterpiece, and really gives a space feeling of something similar to the end battle of Saving Private Ryan. Characters are well enough written for you to enjoy and like them all, however they are a little underdeveloped for the most part and you end up wanting more from them. This ends up not hindering the film too much since the film is a standalone. This film does carry itself well, it knows when to be dark without over doing it and changes location at a nice rate with a clear understanding of where and what folk are doing.This also the first film where Darth Vader is actually fully terrifying, he is almost like an insanely powerful sci fi MikeMyers. Even thoug he isn’t in it much, his presence is palpable.The good thing about Rogue One also is that it doesn’t try to keep using nostalgia to interest its viewers (which TFA did a lot) but does have plenty of nice little easter eggs.The droid K2SO in the film is also the comic relief of it, but whilst a few jokes hit the mark a lot are unnecessary and too forced in, and there is (like TFA) a lot of cheesy 2016 throwaway jokes just put in there. Disney need to learn to restrain themselves from certain jokes, and when they do put them in they need to understand when to end the joke and how to fully have them come across.Last two complaints, the new score for the film is cheesy and doesn’t fit the film at all, and really takes away from it as a whole sadly. Dubbing John Williams over it would be very cheap, but to be honest it would probably make the film feel more epic and fit more. There is also some questionable CGI characters in the film which just look unnatural in the film but still don’t ruin it too much.Overall, this film diverges enough away from Star Wars to make it feel fresh but also very nicely connects itself to the original trilogy. Action is awesome yet characters are a little underdeveloped, special effects are gorgeous but score is disappointing. It is a tragic war film set in the Star Wars universe, and Gareth Edwards did something brave with what he had.Bravo to you sir.8/10",

Along the way, it both suffers and benefits from the worldRogue One is an amazing movie, but it takes some time to become it. It has an uneven, and somewhat uninteresting beginning, a fun but rather incongruous middle, and a spectacular end. Along the way, it both suffers and benefits from the world in which it's set.Rogue One is a unique journey through a very familiar world. It has everything you'd hope to see in a Star Wars movie - space battles, stormtroopers, new alien races, lovable droids, rogues turned heroes. Yet it still manages to feel fresh and different from the rest. I personally felt that this was one of the film's strengths, that it was something different. However, the film also pays a little too much homage to Star Wars: A New Hope, its immediate successor in the Star Wars chronology. There are several character from the original film who appear in Rogue One, a couple of whom are digitally rendered. It doesn't work. At all. It's rather unsettling to look at, and I'd much prefer they just recast those roles if they're set on using those characters.Once the film builds momentum, it's delightful to watch. The humor is great, the action is thrilling, and there are some genuinely real character moments. Sadly, the film is also punctuated throughout with heavy-handed attempts to inspire (you've never heard the word \"hope\" used so many times in a single screenplay). And there is an evil lair which is laughably on the nose. It couldn't get more stereotypically cartoonish.Despite its faults, Rogue One is a great time. It's definitely worth seeing in the theaters, but be aware: it might be a little intense for young kids.",

The general consensus of last years Force Awakens was that the spirit of the original trilogy returned. However, the problem with Episode VII is in how the spirit is captured identically. In having returned so reverently, the franchise needed to display a willingness to tinker. Enter the newest cinematic addition to Star Wars. Rogue One is a balanced movie of hope and despair. The last Star Wars movie to find this magical balance in tone is The Empire Strikes Back. Likewise, Rogue One finds a unique synergy between old and new. The first anthology Star Wars movie works in its inevitable lead-in to an almost forty-year-old classic with a sense of invigoration. The movie smartly covers up modern filmmaking conventions with amazing throwbacks to the original trilogy. Seventies style facial hair can still be found on the Rebel pilots while a few smart cameos make the Star Wars initiated feel at home. The amount of Star Warsness to the film allows director Gareth Edwards to comfortably recton A New Hope. A problem with Rogue One is how the film can only be best enjoyed by a Star Wars fan. Rogue One is a decent enough war movie. The dogfights are exciting. The characters are charming and funny enough. The overall plot can’t be fully enjoyed without having seen A New Hope. In addition, the cinematic impact the film has on the future of this storied franchise also can't be appreciated by an outsider. Rogue One features the most diverse cast of any Star Wars movie... as well as the franchises more intense scenes. The mentioned scenes make up some of the best moments in a Star Wars movie to date. Rest assured the future of the franchise is in the very capable hands of Disney. Rouge One is how a franchise should make the old relevant.",

I agree character and pacing is a bit off, but I think people forget that Star Wars never really had great character development to begin with but rather great actors giving a really good performance (ie Harrison Ford's lines a lot of his one-liners were ad lib). My personal gripe with this film is probably that a lot of the characters felt a bit tagged on - like the blind dude etc, and some of the choices they do (ie in the ending) feels forced and illogical -and could have been written better in terms of what happens to them. The ending is rather unambiguous and a certain CGI character appears too much and does something at the end for no reason (only to ensure there won't be a sequel). Also Gareth Edwards could've shot some of the action scenes better and give some character's a proper arc which was lacking. Lack of a crawl and insistence of using location cards were a bit off-putting.However Rogue One has the best world building, plot development, costume design, lighting and story flow out of the other Star Wars films. The film doesnt rely on wipes to get to one place to another which is great. Rogue one also have amazing action sequences and impeccable sound design. All the locations feel like real worlds compared to Force Awaken (which felt like small set designs). Although the score lacked more distinguishable motifs, I thought it flowed really well with the action o the films - and more of the traditional motifs were integrated well.  Overall I thought Rogue One was a better Star Wars film than TFA and maybe even ROTJ, only because the world building and action was impeccable.",

I read a lot of reviews before I actually went and saw this film. So while reading these reviews I was beginning to become skeptical myself, they ranted and raved about how the Disney keeps introducing planets and characters that they want us to fall in love with or force upon us and have never heard of. This is a side story all on it's own, so we are going to meet characters that we don't know, we are going to see planets that we haven't seen before, and that is ok.\"Rogue One\" is probably the best Star Wars film since \"The Empire Strikes Back\", it leaves us right where it is supposed to chronologically in the saga. It has you pulling and falling in love with all the characters for the most part. The little cameos that we see here and there are well placed to give you that little nostalgia feeling.If we all remember in \"Episode IV: A New Hope\" where the leader of the Rebel Alliance Mon Mothma says that a lot of people had lost their lives to recover these plans. Well \"Rogue One\" is the story behind what she was talking about.Jyn Erso the daughter of Galen Erso, was played by Felicity Jones, an English actress known for playing the role of Jane Hawking in the film \"The Theory of Everything\" in 2014. I am sure now she will be known as the actress who starred in \"Rogue One\". She played the role with poise and gumption, bringing the character to life with the strength that her character stood for in the saga. We first meet her character at an adult age when she has already been captured by Imperials and is then \"liberated\" by members of the Rebel Alliance. Those Rebels would be Cassian Andor and K-2SO played by Diego Luna and the delightful Alan Tudyk. Diego Luna plays a rough around the edges and very secretive scoundrel role in this film, where you don't know if he is good guy or bad guy, while Alan Tudyk plays his sarcastic and very blunt comedic sidekick that is sure to leave you laughing and begging for more.If you are going to go see this film, keep an open mind that this is a story that we knew little of, and that Disney did a great job bringing this story to life and giving us more of an insight on what the Rebel Alliance went through to overcome the great evil that was the Empire.This movie isn't meant to be compared to any of the other episodes that we have seen in previous years. It is to tell the prequel story of the most beloved Trilogy of all time. So don't go to this film with doubts, go to see this film with the hopes to catch a glimpse of something you have never seen before, there are no preconceptions of what to think, because this is a whole brand new story, so you can take it for what it is for, a wonderfully filmed movie, with characters you can connect with for the first and (spoiler alert) the last time.The film has everything, AT-AT's, AT-ST's, sarcastic droids, Dog Fights, real plot lines and a grand finish! A must see in theaters, don't wait to Redbox this movie, you need to go see it in theaters to appreciate it's full value.I hope this review was helpful, and I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did.Vader is still a beast!-Devin of All Things Nerdy",

I'll explain.Firstly, a lot of what makes Star Wars, Star Wars, is absent.  No Jedi vs Sith light saber fights here.  No Jedi at all actually.  Vader is a fun presence in the movie, while he's on screen for all of 5 minutes in a 2 hour movie, but he's only in it for 5 minutes.  There's a lot of little references to A New Hope, that I'm sure fans enjoyed, but they're pretty forced.Jedi aside, one of my favorite things about the original trilogy was the banter between Leia and Han.  Nothing really resembling that here.  Or the daring getaways in the millennium falcon.... again, not really.What there is here, is a by the numbers simple rebel rebellion war movie, crippled by a need to give constant nostalgic nods to better movies of the past, and a PG-13 rating.  I hear people calling this one \"gritty\".  Compared to what exactly?  Certainly not compared to an actual war movie, like this is doing a poor job of trying to mimic.  Gritty compared to a Disney cartoon?  Well, maybe not even that.  No cussing, no blood, no dark references of any kind... This is a wannabe war movie sanitized for little kids.That's a problem, however, since the first 2 thirds of the movie involves a LOT of standing around talking, nothing happening, with boring characters.  Children will be bored.  Very bored.  Adults who aren't huge Star Wars fans should be bored.  It's a stupid predictable plot, with paper thin characters, and bad dialogue.  Trying to end on a positive note.... There was a good scene with Vader (about 3 minutes long), that I enjoyed, and K-2SO can be pretty funny sometimes.  So, about maybe 10 minutes of good stuff in this 2 hour movie for this guy.  What do I have this at?  A 4?  Thinking about this better, lets lower that down a notch.  A 3.

What I just saw blew me away. What I came out of was \"Star Wars\" at it's best. \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\" is, IMHO, now the TRUE best Star Wars film since \"The Empire Strikes Back\". Set before the original \"Star Wars\" from 1977, this film shows us a true WAR in \"Star Wars\" by having spies of the Rebel Alliance go up against the evil Galactic Empire to steal the plans to their original Death Star. And, since Gareth Edwards, the director of this movie, really wanted to deliver a war film set in the Star Wars universe, akin to \"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"Black Hawk Down\", he was telling the truth coming out of what I saw. It really feels like a Star Wars movie in a whole new way. I will admit that I enjoyed \"The Force Awakens\", but, after a while, I've come to realize that while it is watchable, it feels safe in some ways. This one, really showed how original, different and new it was while being familiar when it knew too and it payed off big time in what I consider it's most serious, if not darkest, Star Wars ever. The entire cast of this movie shines. Felicity Jones plays Jyn Erso, our lead hero with strong brashness but such vulnerability you can't help but feel bad for her when you see how things play out for her in the film, especially with her father Galen (played by the always devious yet charming Mads Mikkelsen). Diego Luna puts effort into his role as Cassian Andor and makes it as memorable as his character's arc in the film is. Riz Ahmed really shows how conflicted his character, Bodhi Rook, is as he delivers playing a former Imperial cargo worker now struggling to redeem himself. Donnie Yen,\" and Jiang Wen are awesome as the pair of Force-believing warrior Chirrut Imwe and trigger-happy gun-wielding Baze Malbus. And, Alan Tudyk as the sarcastic reprogrammed droid K-2SO rounds out the cast to help make this movie work in their best way and they all get moments to shine in such iconic ways. Ben Mendohlson really showed his determination playing Orson Krennic in a different kind of villain for \"Star Wars\" to show. Darth Vader when he shows up really shows in this time where the film is set, he really is the Vader everyone grew up with. But, I cannot get off the hook without saying how impressed I am by Forest Whitaker's performance of my most anticipated character from this movie, Saw Gerrera from \"Star Wars: The Clone Wars\". While he was in this movie for more or less of what I expected, Forest Whitaker REALLY got into character as Saw and portrayed him in all the ways he was portrayed when we first saw him in \"The Clone Wars\". Also, if you generational Star Wars fans are hoping for ties to the Prequel Trilogy instead of just the Originals, well you're in luck, as we get appearances of not just characters and actors from the Prequels but also planets from the Prequels as well. We also visit new planets that help expand many parts of the Star Wars mythology such as where people stand in believing the Force and what it took to build the Death Star. Plus, be on the lookout for appearances and mentions of certain characters and ships from \"Star Wars Rebels\", which you can watch on Disney XD, when it returns with new episodes in January. Also, two important characters from the Original Trilogy make a return in some of the most well-made VFX ever put to film. I'm not spoiling who they are, so, you'll just have to watch for yourself. And, you'll feel like you're part of the action especially once you get to the epic space battle in the climax of the movie. Finally, Michael Giacchino really delivered with his score for this movie that really brings out the action and emotional development these characters go through to complete their mission as well as bringing something new to score in \"Star Wars\" while sprinkling familiar scores when needed. Overall, if you're looking for a phenomenal \"Star Wars\" film, \"Rogue One\" is that. It truly delivers on taking huge risks, like abandoning the traditional opening crawl, and finding its place into the \"Star Wars\" universe while remaining a standalone movie that really doesn't need to setup anything for the future of \"Star Wars\". And, that's good. I hope this movie is successful enough to do more riskier Star Wars spinoffs, especially if Episode IX is the last of the core Star Wars saga. I hope you all love this film, because I most certainly did. This film is for all generations of Star Wars fans. Go see it. You'll be glad you did. 5 stars. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️10/10",

With almost documentary-like camerawork, this is the most handheld Star Wars film by far, offering a more grounded and realistic feel, but the dialogue can feel cheesy and cliche at times. Very well shot but also very imperfectly shot, this film looks flat-out gorgeous. The editing can be a little choppy at times though, but that isn’t anywhere near as distracting as the CGI version of Grand Moff Tarkin, as well as some other CGI characters. Which brings me to my biggest gripe - The characters. Likeable, funny, but that’s about it - They lack any depth, background, or proper development, and we aren’t given any reason to care for them. Director Orson Krennic is an extremely weak villain and doesn’t even compare to Darth Vader, who was only in TWO SCENES. This wouldn’t have been as much of a complaint if the rest of the characters were more interesting, but it still would’ve been a stupid choice. The first act of the movie is quite messy, and feels like a series of loosely tied together scenes, jumping from location to location too quick and repetitively. There isn’t really much else for me to say about the rest of the movie apart from the last act, which is a long if not too long action sequence, and although VERY entertaining and brilliantly directed, it has endless cliches and does get repetitive after awhile. Lacking any suspense that the previous Star Wars excelled at, this is a fun, decent ride with incredible effects but it is a very disappointing installment to the Star Wars franchise. I don’t see there being any replay value either. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story gets a 6 out of 10. It’s decent.",

The CGI effects are out of this world, no pun intended, and in some cases amazing as an actor who has been dead over 22 years is very much alive, another looks 40 years younger and another who is in their 80s sounds like a teenager! They are the set up for the very first Star Wars movie ever made though the ending leaves nothing in doubt.I wasn't familiar with many of the leading actors but I was impressed with Donnie Yen as a blind monk, Wen Jiang as a warrior, Riz Ahmed a pilot and Diego Luna as one of the leading rebels. Oh yes, a nod of the head to Alan Tudyk for the wisecracking 7-8 foot droid K-2SO. Forest Whitaker is wasted in a cameo which really has nothing to do with what the screenplay by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy is heading for and director Gareth Edwards is all over the screen in the action scenes and only hits the warmer minutes towards the end of the film.Oh I forgot to mention Ben Mendelsohn's villain maybe because he is forgettable?I am not a fan of Star Wars or sci-fi films and told Allen he is on his own for future Star Wars films.Unless you are a fanatical fan of the series or a couple of CGI effects regarding people I would suggest staying away.",

Disney isn't even pretending anymore that this whole project isn't just a cash grab on their part (why cast 2 famous Chinese actors and barely use them? Gotta get that foreign box office!). The story adds little if anything to the universe, frankly it clashes badly with the tone and themes of the original trilogy. The action is dull and same-y; I never really felt worried about what would happen next, even when characters were actually getting killed. Above all it's virtually impossible to invest in the characters or care what happens to them, partly because they're bland and poorly developed, and especially because we've all seen this stock lineup of Hollywood-diverse plucky underdogs a million times before (fighting white male Space Nazis of course. Whether Marvel or Star Wars or whatever, these days the enemy must always be white male Nazis) and it's beyond a cliche at this point. Note how even positive reviewers all admit that the most likeable character was the droid. Felicity Jones was especially awful, a scowling, frigid blank slate light-years away from the feisty, vivacious Princess Leia of the original movies. She gives pop culture heroines a bad name.The bit at the end about struggling to get a signal and transmit a file was especially embarrassing. So cliched you half expect it's about to turn into a Verizon ad.I think the NY Times said it best: \"the only force here is force of habit\". The whole reason Disney bought this franchise (because apparently \"Star Wars\" is now something you can just buy like an old couch on Craigslist) is because they know people are so addicted to the brand that they'll line up at the theater even if their new movies are mediocre. They're going to keep cranking this crap out until everyone is sick to death of Star Wars. I don't see how anyone can be OK with that and still call themselves a fan of the series.",

Rogue One shows that there are stories worth telling in between the major events seen in each Episode film.

Starting with this one, Disney took it upon itself to purvey an annual movie within litigating film release schedule. Kathleen Kennedy and formidable crew of the factory covet with making an empirical universe about the preternatural galaxy far, far away; and to achieve this, they have concluded to try its luck with Edwards' war experiment in order to elucidate whether it is beneficial to create a line of independent events out of the Skywalker family. \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\" opens by far a feasible wave of dissimilar films of a galactic anthology while focusing and securing its strongest point in the director's fervent declaration: war film which does not drink neither George Lucas' nor J. J. Abrams' lymph for manufacturing a deferential, nostalgic, cogitative, and sometimes dispiriting extension in Star Wars mythology.Its narrative component emulates the scale clichés of the original trilogy: a princess, a robot, a misanthrope, a strife between the dark side and the light side and of course display of spaceships assailing each other. Conversely, this compact design takes risks as for inquiring into primitive and uncommon perspectives, which foster a fortification of a deeper concept around mythology. And although as a last resort is a war celluloid more than remarkable—in spite of it merely sketches certain characteristics and focuses its plausible references in \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967) by Robert Aldrich—does not manage to be a corporeal Star Wars movie since it's constantly held on by fan service and generates a quite primary treatment to the development. A prime look to unfamiliar areas from a standpoint's as ordinary as opposed, a wit tinged of tribulation and grief and one of the most honorable final thirds in a blockbuster in recent times are the unforeseen top ambitions by the filmmaker.It takes place before the events of \"Episode IV,\" \"Rogue One\" came up from a shallow idea of visual effects supervisor and CCO at Industrial Light & Magic John Knoll, which consisted in clarifying the time- space around what was the itinerary of the Death Star plans until being in Princess Leia Organa's hands , route somewhat named in \"A New Hope\". So this is the story of those ordinary beings who achieved the extraordinary. Innocent Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) opens with a retrospective scene about her girlhood, underlined by tragedy and misfortune. Thereon, it introduces her as a redeemed prisoner who is moved to a Rebel Alliance HQ. There, a transcendental mission has commended her in order to make contact with his fading father for locating and discovering the nature and the place of a substantially powerful weapon. Ordinary people clan gradually takes form, finding its cardinal mover into the force. Although the fabled team bounces from a planet to another for terminating its commission, we figured out exiguous details about the crew captained by Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) —who made me very proud;—likewise, most fans clamor for more background in Saw Gerrera's story, the leader of the Onderon rebels. Despite the fact that the depth was an authentic reverb, character designs and performances are what many fans were waiting for. Displaying a heterogeneous and multicultural acting cast, which delves into each contemporary civilization, the film takes advantage of the cultural range to generate a vast human-racial universe inside its world, in the same way, each performer gets its moment of glory before the decisive and evocative ending. Their performances made the audience proud, so much so that was ineluctable not yell in the credits of the motion picture.More suitable for adults than infants, more suitable for warsies than mass audiences. If it were action and conflagration scenes, the near-perfect third act would lead the film to the sublime, sadly, its burning and high-octane last forty minutes aren't enough to keep afloat lack of enthusiasm and the multiplicity of the beginning and exposition, opportunities lacking in momentum and vigor that exclusively are notable for performances and special effects. In time record, Giacchino composed an entrancing, nostalgic and fortifying soundtrack, which is assembled with the dark tone of each frame, also it testifies him as the first author in breaking John Williams' musical canon. \"Rogue One\" is more a war product, in where its spectacular music, sparkling performances, and nearly excellent action sequences invade unexplored lands and nothing irreverent in Star Wars world, also, the film gives a message of hope and encourages all us, who this year lost a great woman: imposing Carrie Fisher.

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nI find it amazing so many people like and even love this movie.The worst problem it has is characterization. In a movie in which the main themes are heroism, villainy and the clash between two opposite forces representing antagonist ideals, it is impossible for me to get involved with characters this flat, uninteresting and with no sort of interaction amongst themselves. Aside from that, as far as storytelling goes, the movie is very clumsy, going from one scene to next with no connecting threads or imaginative way to link the set pieces together. Showing you the name of the planet where the action was going to take place was a bad joke and the most witless technique i have seen in my life. Then there is the fan service. This is probably the worst part, because they put in characters that didn´t do anything important and weren´t really a part story just to make fans happy, they did the same in The Force Awakens, but at least there they made them do something. The worst of all was the final scene with Darth Vader slaughtering rebels and people applauding it, when he is the bad guy, but of course, they didn´t give a hoot about the good guys in the movie, they just wanted to see the iconic Star Wars characters in action not caring a bit about how little sense it all made in terms of storytelling.I could write for hours about all the flaws in this movie in terms of bad pacing, boring dialogue, and complete lack of imagination in execution.Overall, I don´t think it´s a terrible movie, it´s just a completely uninspired, average sci-fi film with really good visual effects that takes advantage of Star Wars iconography to seduce non critical masses. But it really gets on my nerves when people say this is better than The Force Awakens and even the original trilogy, cause it´s not, it is one of the worst Star Wars movies along with The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nLike many people, I went to rewatch this after being let down by The Last Jedi, and boy, did I forget how much I enjoyed this film. It's basically a war movie set in the Star Wars universe, and as such isn't limited by the trappings of a Star Wars movie (no opening scrawl! No Jedi or lightsaber battles - the closing scene is an exception, but more on that later) and I remember thinking this film represented so much potential for the Star Wars license now out of Lucas's restrictive hands - imagine, an entire universe of Star Wars stories being told on the big screen without being tied down by the restrictions of a main \"Star Wars\" Episode. Rogue One is a great start to this Anthology universe.Spoilers abound!THE GOOD: Yes, there are a lot of characters, and some have criticised that we don't have time to get to know them before they all die horribly and hence the deaths aren't emotional for us - but I didn't feel that way. I thought the characters worked - Jyn was a strong female protagonist who clearly had chemistry with her father Galen, Cassian served his purpose, and Chirrut and Baze were standouts to me (even though a great many stormtroopers had to play into the stereotype and die stupidly to establish Chirrut's awesomeness). I fell for K2SO - he grew on me and his end was tragic (perhaps biased by my fondness for Alan Tudyk and his character's equally tragic end on 'Serenity'). The crew's deaths worked for me, because I felt I grew to know them enough over the course of the movie to care about them - I know this wasn't the case for everyone. When Cassian tells Bodhi the pilot \"You're our only way out of here\" before the final battle on Scarif, I thought this was going to be another happy-ending no-stakes Rebel tale - didn't see the grim ending coming until K-2SO took a blaster bolt to the chest.Darth Vader in the hallway at the end - sweet Christmas. I swear there was a mass orgasm in the cinema when that scene happened, and I'm not ashamed to admit I was part of it. Yes, shameless fan service - but it worked very, very well. The OG stormtroopers, Imperial sets and the Death Star also scratched many nostalgia itches for me.Original Trilogy cameos - I felt these were more than fan service since Rogue One was supposed to be a prequel to A New Hope. I'll admit I'm big on nostalgia so all the cameos worked for me - I was overjoyed at Grand Moff Tarkin and even loved Dr Evazan and Ponda Baba (more poignant as Dr Evazan's actor passed away shortly after my viewing).Finally, the cinematography in this film was amazing (one of The Last Jedi's strongest points as well). The wide shots of the Star Destroyer over Jedha City, the Scarif beach, the Death Star ominously peeking over the horizon, the view of Scarif from space through the Rebel flagship's floor, the space battle itself - I found it all breathtaking.THE BAD:Krennic as a villain served his purpose, but I felt he was underused. In the iTunes extras, director Gareth Edwards explains he couldn't make Vader or Tarkin the villain because they had plot armour and clearly survive the movie - this is probably why they had to cook Krennic up. Mendelsohn does a good job but is clearly upstaged by Vader and Tarkin whenever they are onscreen.Forest Whitaker was wasted as Saw Guerrera, I feel - this character has a far more interesting arc in the Clone Wars and Rebels animated series, which explores his fanaticism and his hatred for what the Empire did to his sister. In this film he was a plot device.I'm all for diversity in film - but while watching this film I could tell that the diversity was inserted on purpose. Not a bad thing, but it felt a little forced.As with all Star Wars films, suspension of disbelief is required - stormtroopers still can't shoot for nuts, a whole battalion of them are defeated by a blind man with a stick in the beginning but by the end of the film they are a credible threat to a well-armed band of Rebels.THE VERDICT: A thoroughly enjoyable film, and well worth Disney buying the franchise in my opinion (The Last Jedi notwithstanding). Spells a lot of potential for future Star Wars Anthology films - here's hoping Solo lives up to the mark.",

We saw sacrifices being made over and over for the sake of the Rebellion. This is why people are calling this a “dark” movie. It’s too optimistic, the rebels too successful, for the movie to be called dark; it’s weighty. The successes are earned at incredible cost. Such is war.One notable disappointment here was the musical score. It felt largely repurposed from John Williams’ previous work — and sometimes, that was enough, but it felt like a timid mimicry of greatness. Were there any new musical themes introduced? I don’t recall any. It’s fine, even necessary, to use the Imperial March when Vader shows up, but there needs to be more, too.We met so many delightful characters — all human except for K-2, whose brand of humor was most welcome, and which stands in stark contrast to the dumb dad-jokes C-3PO made in the latter prequels. No, this was smarter humor, which felt (again) more “earned.”Here’s hoping future Star Wars films will be more Rogue One and less The Force Awakens!",

Check out myRelated media: The three prequels have been quite soulless, as the actors had to act opposite green screens most of the time, while The Force Awakens (TFA) was a great disappointment as it heavily ripped off A New Hope (ANH). Check out my review of the latter, if you can find it.>What's Rogue One (RO) like?: Story-wise, it's like other past films where the protagonists had to risk their lives to infiltrate the opposite side so as to steal something, except that here, there are also spaceships and lasers... It was better than TFA, but it also has several problems. >Pros: >1. TFA broke many of the conventions and principles behind how The Force works and how things work in general! For no apparent reason, Rey knew how to pilot a complex spaceship and how to fight with a lightsaber without having been trained on either task beforehand. (This is all down to JJ Abrams. On Star Trek (2009) it was inspiring, but Into Darkness and TFA just made me question his destructive creativity. His earlier films were also quite unruly. I've decided to never watch his films again.)  RO avoids this by not invoking the use of the force that often. Most events made sense. This film is a fitting addition to the Star Wars Expanded Universe.>2. The battle scene on Scarif was nice. >Cons:>1. RO is only slightly better than TFA. The story is less contrived than in TFA. However, it was still rather ridiculous that our heroes need to travel to so many places and to go through so many hoops to get the jobs done. Some parts seemed drawn out. >2. Apart from Jyn, the other main characters were not developed sufficiently, in the rush to show the action scenes. >3. The actor playing Commander Krennic seemed to be over-acting, all the time. He was unnecessarily angry and devilish all of the time.>4. The CGI in this film has some significant flaws. The Star Destroyers look like Lego pieces when in front of a bright background, while the fully computer-generated Grand Moff Tarkin looked... computer-generated. The eyes! You have to sort out the problem with the static eyes!  The production had $200m and these problems were not solved?>5. I thought the destruction of Alderaan in ANH was the first time the Death Star fired its main laser and destroyed a planet? In ANH, Grand Moff Tarkin said, “Princess Leia, before your execution, I’d like you to join me for a ceremony that will make this battle station operational… In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that is to be destroyed FIRST. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power on your home planet of Alderaan.” Furthermore, Obi-Wan only felt the pain from the destruction of Alderaan and not from any moon or planet before that. The firing of the main laser in RO was not mere a test. Has this film created a continuity error? >6. The new musical score was a strange and horrible choice. The score rises to a crescendo in a haphazard way and then abruptly drops and goes all over the place. Which inexperienced composer was hired to do this? A Golden Raspberry Award is coming up.> 7. There was no need to show Leia at the end of RO. (It is not a spoiler that she's coming up next in ANH.) The CGI was inadequate and the scene should have been left out.>How would the different age groups rate it?Children: ExcellentTeenagers: ExcellentYoung adults: ExcellentMedium age adults: GoodOld adults: Average.My rating: 4/5 (no half scores).

I'll go ahead and write here:-Did it feel like Star Wars?=Yes, absolutely. It was perfect. The atmosphere, the characters, the planets, everything felt like how a Star Wars movie should.-How about dat Darth Vader tho?=It was...okay, I guess. He could've been better used, but the way he's used still makes up for it. -Was it the best Star Wars eva?=I'd say 3rd best, behind A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back.Overall, I believe this was a really good Star Wars film, and a good film in general.",

It delves straight into a frantic affair rather than the slow crawl of subtext that appear throughout the series.There is a lack of screen wipes during scene changes, this might sound like a small detail, but in the grand scheme of Star Wars movies, this has always been a staple that felt extremely jarring for a first time viewing.It’s these small details that don’t feel familiar which will have people annoyed or at least scratching their heads.Also Darth Vader makes a pun. No, that should never happen again.That being said, I appreciate the movie nonetheless.This movie is not afraid to take risks and I greatly respect that.While the previous filming  decisions seem a bit jarring, many of the other changes to the Star Wars formula feel like a welcome addition to the universe.The Rebel Alliance is shown to be something other than an angelic being to rid the galaxy of the big bad guys.They make deals with extremists, fight guerrilla wars and hide within civilian populations. I love the expansion of ideals and it even warrants the idea that some were even content or happy with the empire in comparison.The agents and main characters aren’t necessarily the good guys, they are just fighting for what they believe in. Many of them even fight for what the viewer may perceive as the wrong reasons, but the right cause.There is so much in this movie that makes the conflict and galaxy feel more real than the main series.Especially the third act, which is hands down the best part of the movie.The final battle was magnificent from beginning to end, it felt like watching the Vietnam War in space. That is about the best thing I could ever imagine.I could have had the entire movie be the story be about some random soldiers on this battlefield and it might have actually been a better film.Unfortunately because of the highs of the third act it makes the first two acts look weak in comparison.The film has some major pacing issues in the first act. Nothing quite seemed to flow properly and getting all the information before the film moved along to the next scene was challenging.It feels like first portions of the movie were solely there to get towards the final act. That inherently makes it less fun to experience.The film needed a couple more relaxed moments for the characters to build who they were for each other.\n\nThey never quite felt like they cared for each other which in a movie about a squad of characters is really needed.\n\nThe best comparison I can make is to Guardians of The Galaxy. The characters never had that moment of interaction that made them bond together through exploits which Guardians of The Galaxy pulled off with flying colors.\n\nThis movie needed that to really put the exclamation point on the third act.\n\nIn summary, I enjoyed the hell out of Rogue One despite some pacing issues and lack of character empathy.\n\nIf you didn’t enjoy The Force Awakens because it felt like a retread of the original film, this will likely be a much more enjoyable affair.\n\nAs a movie, it feels like a fresh take on the Star Wars universe. While that doesn’t always work the way intended, it sets up the ability for other directors and filmmakers in the future to do the same. I greatly respect that idea and look forward to see what is next.\n\nView the video version of this review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGi71YjuxQA",

You get a whole bunch of new and dispensable characters most of which I've completely forgotten, a story that's missing the wow factor, a great soundtrack and a decent cast. Don't get me wrong I didn't hate this movie, there was some scenes I thoroughly enjoyed and honestly most of them were towards the end. Yet overall I was a little underwhelmed but can take comfort in the fact that this is not the worst Star Wars movie you could watch.However, let us not forget what this movie really is...a cash grab. A filler movie with some nice little bits of nostalgia to remind you that oh yes this IS a Star Wars movie. The inevitability of Disney owning Star Wars is we'll get a new movie every year and that might sound like a dream come true now but in the year 2040 with the 32nd Star Wars movie you'll wish you never heard the words Disney and Star Wars together. I'll recommend this because it's worth a watch once but if you're a Star Wars fan you'll go see this no matter what anyone says.",
