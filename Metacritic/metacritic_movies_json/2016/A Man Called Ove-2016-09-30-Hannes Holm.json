An isolated retiree with strict principles and a short fuse, who spends his days enforcing block association rules that only he cares about, and visiting his wife\u2019s grave, Ove has given up on life. Enter a boisterous young family next door who accidentally flattens Ove\u2019s mailbox while moving in and earning his special brand of ire.

    "critic_reviews": [
        "All movies are manipulative by default; the effectiveness of that manipulation is the more valid measurement to inspect. On that scale, A Man Called Ove is a morbidly funny and moving success.",
        "Holm\u2019s adaptation is a darkly funny, tragic, and ultimately heartwarming tearjerker about the life of one lonely but extraordinary man.",
        "As well as ruminating on grief and the impalpable, incomprehensible sense of loss in the wake of a lifelong love, A Man Called Ove gives credence to the notion that there is much more to any individual than merely a name, that outer appearance and behaviour belie an unknown past.",
        "Holm\u2019s well-judged adaptation of the bestseller keeps the maudlin to a minimum and plays the black comedy just right. A strong contender for feel-good film of the year.",
        "We\u2019ve seen crusty old geezers with hearts of gold plenty of times in films. Here we see how this one got that way, and thanks to Lassgard and Holm, it\u2019s a journey we care about taking.",
        "A Man Called Ove hits all of the genre\u2019s sweet spots, without ever tipping into the saccharine. Most of the credit can be thrown Rolf Lassgard\u2019s way, as the actor gives Ove a humanity, and humility, that is expertly crafted and genuine.",
        "We\u2019ve seen these poignant lessons before: Ove is destined to learn that he can\u2019t do it all on his own and that life is still worth living. Yet the moving twists and turns of the love story and the bright comedy elevate an otherwise familiar story line.",
        "It\u2019s also overlong and sentimental. But it\u2019s a vivid, warm and amusing portrait of a real man, someone whose life began in darkness, experienced the light of a great love and has collapsed into a pit of self-pity.",
        "Though our put-upon hero\u2019s gradual realization that he has much to live for is obvious from the get-go, it still is a pleasant journey from pawn to king \u2014 spiritually speaking, of course.",
        "A charming, warm-hearted Swedish dramedy about the redemptive power of neighborly love.",
        "A Man Called Ove has some tear-jerking moments, but the film is so carefully designed \u2014 with long, circular takes that seem to surround the main characters at crucial fateful points \u2014 that technique often triumphs over sentimentality.",
        "Sweet and flinty in roughly equal measure, the movie's a big hit in its native country.",
        "A Man Called Ove \u2014 preaching tolerant togetherness as the key to happiness \u2014 earns its sentimentality by striking a delicate balance between barking-mad comedy and syrupy melodrama.",
        "Incorporating fluid flashbacks and snippets of narration that refreshingly serve to enhance rather than distract, director-writer Hannes Holm maintains a gentle, lyrical flow while coaxing fine performances from a diverse cast.",
        "The last ten minutes or so are heartwarming to the point of schmaltz. Even the adept Lassg\u00e5rd, as the old fogey version of Ove, can\u2019t make this increasingly feel-good schtick stick.",
        "It\u2019s hard to resist the joy of the film, the unbridled heart, and Ove\u2019s tremendous, hilarious hatred for all the idiots of the world.",
        "Lassg\u00e5rd won\u2019t let you off easy: A scene in which Ove weeps hopelessly before the magnitude of his loneliness will bring tears to the eyes of anyone who has suffered a loss. His Ove is a man indeed.",
        "It's emotionally manipulative, but its two leads find a core of humanity even in the most calculating plot machinations.",
        "Despite winning work from the lead, it\u2019s a tame, feelgood effort from writer-director Hannes Holm. Academy bait.",
        "Starting out with a bracing, off-kilter wryness, Ove moves steadily, and disappointingly, toward the crowd-pleasing center.",
        "Good-hearted stuff, to be sure, but mainly of interest to lovers of cinematic comfort food."

The well known  Swedish actor, Rolf Lassgard. portrays Mr. Ove in this story of a widowed senior who confronts the loss of his wife and ponders his future as he meets and interacts with new neighbors and acquaintances in the small town where he and his wife lived. This is a simple film filled with simple characters who in some way or another bring hope and joy to their otherwise bland existences. What makes the film work is that it is effortless viewing as the audience, via flashback, witnesses the youth and adulthood of Mr. Ove and how, in each instance, he plays the hands life has dealt him. I give the film an 8.0 with a note to anyone wishing to see it that it will no longer be distributed and available for viewing after October 13, an indeed unlucky number for anyone who misses it.",

The setting is Sweden, but it could be anywhere.  You start off not liking the old man, Ove, but then as he slowly recovers from his wife's death, his humanity starts to show through.

Ove is a \"Condo Nazi\", a stickler for community rules and regulations, a crabby neighbor, and a depressed widower. Flashbacks fill us in on salient details that shaped his life, and the people who he admired, and who were, for the most part, sounder humans than he.

This is the tale ofThe life after the loved one departed.24 January 2017This is a Swedish film based on the book of the same name. It is sent to represent the nation at the 2017 Oscars and as for now, it made into the December shortlist. This is the tale of an old grumpy man and the life after the death of his wife. That would be a toughest phase of life for anybody. I am sure you had seen many films like this, but this one was slightly different, yet totally convincing on every topic it focused on. So funny, at a time meaningful and emotional, particularly how the tale ends.In a small township, a 59 year old man called Ove lived most of his life and now he decides to take his life. But the attempt was prevented when a new lousy neighbour arrives and so it keep delays further. Now's the time to reveal all the reasons behind his dreadful decision with lots of flashbacks and current affairs. That he's a nightmare in his neigbourhood to those who break the rules. He's not a friendly type, because of his childhood and the lessons he learnt from his father to face the life as tough it gets.The only friend he ever had did not last for a long. His wife was his world and then the job at the railway. The narration given a good enough focus on his romance life. His younger version, played by another actor reveals particularly the initial stage like how he had met her. I don't know these actors, but they all were so good. A perfect setting as well for the story to take place. I think the filmmakers did lots of best decisions and in the end it all paid off with a greater recognition in the international level.\"Honesty is the best thing, Ove. But sometimes honesty needs a little help.\"A heartwarming comedy-drama for all age groups. I was looking for such a film and I realised only after watching it. The character Ove was designed awesomely and all the story events built around him was excellent. Covered most of the topics like friendship, love, neighbours, job, moral values, even the pet animals. Loads of fun, guaranteed entertainment if you are seeking a comedy film. As Ove was portrayed very seriously, all his actions, especially the newly arrived woman make major difference to end the film most comedic way.The regularly visiting his wife's grave, the film beautifully gives an insight on the life of Ove being a widower and a retiree. But also how it all turns around for him who never laughs and finally he does, was the film's highlight. Like I always say, I'm not a book person, but I love watching films based on the good books like this one. An awesome adaptation and I hope those who loved the book, as well enjoyed the film.Usually all the good films run nearly or over two hours. Because of the slow and steady developments in its characters and the story. For this film, you won't notice the time. The pace of the narration, including the lovable characters and the storyline makes you forget everything else. In a few days the 89th American Academy Awards nominees will be announced and I am sure it will make. Looks like this year, three Scandinavian films going to make the noise at the Oscars. In the meantime, I hint you not to miss it, either it wins or lose, it is one of the best films of the year around the world.8/10",

I have read the novel its based on and I recognised most of what happened from my recollections of the book. Its a bit like a Scandinavian version of Victor Meldrew from the BBC sitcom One Foot In The Grave - Ove is a decent guy who has had a slightly tough past but he comes across as quite snippy and oaf-ish, although he's more likeable than would first appear. It certainly has a sentimental aspect, although it is seemingly quite bleak certainly at the start. As a trigger warning, it does show preparations for suicide attempts, which may upset some, so bare that in mind. I thought the main character was very well portrayed by the actor Rolf Lassgard.It may feature some dark comedy, undoubtedly, but it also felt like quite a re-assuring film and I thought it was well done. Also, here is one short line of dialogue I remember, that made me smile (it was said by Ove himself, responding to someone complaining about him near his house):-'old man? im not your old man, **** - im angry man!' heh!.  The film is in Swedish but if your ok with subtitles (or, of course, understand Swedish) then I would definitely recommend it.",
