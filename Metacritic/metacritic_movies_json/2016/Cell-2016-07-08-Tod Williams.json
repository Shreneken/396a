    "summary": "At the Boston airport, Clay (John Cusack) witnesses a scene of chaotic mayhem when an electronic signal turns hundreds of cell phone users into rabid killers. Desperate to find his estranged wife and son, Clay teams with a train driver (Samuel L. Jackson) to battle the horde of murderous \u201cphoners\u201d as the city descends into apocalyptic madness.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "With a bigger budget and a longer runtime, Cell could easily have been elevated above its current station as a worthy 2 AM viewing on cable \u2014 not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that. It\u2019s cursed with some really cheap CGI, but blessed with actors who are game for, and respect, the material.",
        "Tod Williams, a journeyman best known for Paranormal Activity 2, has managed to transfer King's very popular brand of horror with a good deal of success.",
        "This apocalyptic thriller is a run-of-the-mill zombie flick that goes through the genre motions efficiently enough but fails to live up to its credits.",
        "While it\u2019s nice to see Cusack and costar Samuel L. Jackson downplay rather than go big, Cell has a been-there-done-that quality that winds up feeling a bit disappointing.",
        "Even when John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson are slumming it, they\u2019re good fun. Not enough to save the movie, but enough to keep you interested when you click across this thing sometime in your future.",
        "Directed by Tod Williams (Paranormal Activity 2) and co-scripted by King himself, it brings a best seller to the big screen with a minimum of spectacle, a maximum of affordable Georgia locations, and a couple of names to splash prominently across the Amazon rental thumbnail.",
        "This is the undead equivalent of fast food. Some might find comfort in all these known quantities. Those looking for anything of substance would do better to wait for an upgrade.",
        "King worked on the script for Cell, which isn\u2019t that surprising given that many of the worst adaptations of his work have his name on them. It only proves how hard a job it is to adapt King. Even the author himself can\u2019t ace it.",
        "Though it's better than its \"dump this thing\" theatrical release would suggest, Cell is far from excellent.",
        "For John Cusack in Cell, the bad news is that his phone just ran out of juice. The good news, sort of, is that those who are on their phones were just attacked by a piercing signal that turned them into flesh-munching zombies.",
        "The film insufficiently connects the book's prophecy with its present-day, real-world forms of realization.",
        "Given the absurdity of the premise, Cell isn\u2019t nearly as luridly entertaining as it should be.",
        "Dated, despondent and pretty much a disaster, Cell plays like a series of nods to other science fiction-horror hybrids, notably \u201cThe Matrix\u201d (1999) and Philip Kaufman\u2019s 1978 remake of \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers.\u201d",
        "King's decision to co-write the script and turn it into a CliffsNotes version of The Stand only makes things worse.",
        "There are times when Cell feels like a surreal pastiche of po-faced apocalypse movies. But no such luck: this is every bit as bad as it appears."

If you like anything that hints of a zombie apocalypse then you might regard the film as passably OK.  It has some problems.  It's about non-zombie-type zombies.  They do certain things that seem impossible.  Admittedly, zombie flicks are all about the impossible but \"Cell\" provides no real explanation for how the impossible is achieved or what's really going on and in the end it all seems kind of half-assed.  The acting is OK but even Samuel L. Jackson, John Cusack, and Stacy Keach aren't enough to make this tepid production particularly watchable.  Frankly, I'd suggest trying out \"The Signal\" (2007) instead, a very low-budget non-zombie zombie indie that makes characters stand out.",

The movie isThe problem with the movie isn't it's cast (Most of whom give pretty good performances), the low budget, or even it's rather derivative zombie movie formula. It's the writing. This is a very unsatisfying adaptation of the book. The movie is at it's best when it's using scenes straight from the source material. This just doesn't happen very much at all. We see familiar bits and pieces along the way, but for the most part the movie largely does it's own thing, and poorly at that.Those who have read the book will know that it wasn't your average zombie story. King infused the apocalyptic scenario with his unique sense of imagination. The \"Phoners\" were gifted psychic powers, connected by a hive mind, and led by a menacing Phoner of higher intelligence and a thirst for vengeance. The movie touches on those elements, but fails to use them to any satisfying results. They're just sort of there and only serve to confuse those who didn't read the book and tick off those who did with how ineptly they are handled. The plot itself is also only a hollow imitation of the real thing. I understand the obvious budgetary restraints would have prevented an entirely faithful adaptation, but they certainly could have done better than this. It follows the overall outline of the book's plot to a degree, but it's filled in with original moments. None of which are good. All the original stuff is just badly written, particularly where the dialog is concerned. It's all a mad rush to a crappy conclusion. The interesting and important bits are skipped over in favor of a whole lot of nothing. You want to know the really shocking part about all of this? It was written by Stephen King himself. He butchered his own book onscreen! Stick to the books King, because you just proved that you can't write a good movie. Now, I could have dealt with the less than faithful adaptation of the book provided the original stuff was good, but it's not. For my fellow fans of the book, I highly recommend skipping this one. It doesn't do the source material justice at all. As for those without knowledge of the book, but are hoping for a solid zombie flick, also look elsewhere. It's just a bad movie.4.5/10",
