  "critic_reviews": [
    "Visually astonishing and touchingly told, Kubo is utterly wonderful.",
    "If you want to expose your children to a work of art with real soul, you could do a lot worse than Kubo and the Two Strings.",
    "Kubo works because it is so direct, so honest about the emotional story it’s telling. Knight may have epic ambitions, but he keeps the stakes very personal.",
    "The action is gorgeously fluid, the idiosyncratic 3-D visual conceits (including floating eyeballs undersea) are startling, and the story and its metaphors resolve in unexpected and moving ways.",
    "\"Kubo\" is both extraordinarily original and extraordinarily complex.",
    "From its opening image — of a distraught woman battling massive ocean waves on a moonlit night — to its surprisingly ambiguous final shot — of what, I won't say — Kubo and the Two Strings sears itself into your brain.",
    "Staggeringly beautiful and immensely true, the best animated film of 2016 — one of the year’s best films of any kind, really.",
    "Representing a dazzling artistic leap forward for LAIKA, the stop-motion animation studio’s fourth feature — and first full-blown fantasy — is an eye-popping delight that deftly blends colorful folklore with gorgeous, origami-informed visuals to immersive effect.",
    "A simple story told well can still be effective if the emotional resonance underneath it comes through. In Kubo, it absolutely does, thanks to the uniformly excellent voice performances.",
    "Kubo and the Two Strings feels like a miracle, evoking joy, surprise and wonder in its audience.",
    "A visually stunning, richly imagined oasis in a sea of candy-colored safety, and one of the first truly original movies of the year so far.",
    "Displaying the mastery of visuals and storytelling of a more established veteran, Laika president Travis Knight has gone beyond merely crafting a confident directorial debut; he’s made the studio’s best film to date.",
    "It recognizes that our most cherished legends are an endless source of consolation in times of suffering and loss, as well as a vital repository of cultural and generational memory. If that message sounds trite or familiar, it has rarely been driven home with this much conviction and intensity of feeling.",
    "The story is captivating from the very first moments.",
    "With such awe-inspiring artistry, designed so as to never distract from the material it serves, Kubo and the Two Strings stands as the sort of film that feels richer with each successive viewing, from the paper-folded Laika logo at the beginning (an early taste of the stunning origami sequences to follow) to the emotional resonance of its final shot.",
    "Visually inventive and offering up a complex view of family interaction, Kubo and the Two Strings is another feather in the cap for Laika, and a marvel to behold.",
    "The best animated feature (at least thus far) of 2016.",
    "It is definitely the summer for talking animals taking over the cinema, but Kubo manages to rise above the rest of its peers with a wondrous coming-of-age tale full of ancient soul.",
    "One of the most impressive elements of Kubo and the Two Strings — besides its dazzling stop-motion animation, its powerful performances and its transporting score — is the amount of credit it gives its audience, particularly its younger viewers.",
    "The movie is genuinely creative, genuinely outside-the-box, and often genuinely scary; parents of toddlers and nightmare-prone children are herewith warned.",
    "As Kubo warns, early on, don’t blink — you might miss something. Something that — and what a treat this is — you’ve never seen before.",
    "An imaginative, scary and wonderfully rendered stop-motion fright.",
    "This is Laika’s least droll, least ghoulish feature so far; the plotting is even more dreamlike than \"Coraline.\"",
    "It’s not a flawless movie, but there’s real magic in it, and that’s more important, and no less rare, than perfection.",
    "The film doesn’t quite cut loose to hit emotional high notes, but Regina Spektor’s velvety cover of “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” poignantly completes a sweet, generous film.",
    "The first and last things to be said in this limited space about Kubo and the Two Strings are that it’s a showcase for some of the most startlingly beautiful animation in recent — and not so recent — memory.",
    "The tale is layered and lovely, although talk about the real self, eternity and death will stun the adults in the audience.",
    "It’s a beautifully animated tale (keep your eyes on the way Kubo’s hair moves) that balances story with comedy and moments of effective (if light) horror.",
    "The stunning visuals and beautifully conceived milieu distract the viewer from the fact that the quest structure of the story is McGuffin-like and the conclusion emotionally muddled.",
    "Despite a traditional-seeming quest for a suit of armor and a sword, the film’s intrinsic message is all about the transformative powers of music and love. It’s a movie the whole family can rock out to.",
    "I cannot stress enough how truly stunning the brilliant visuals are in this movie. Laika has again crafted a world that is such an original vision, one that will live on as a new classic in the world of animation.",
    "Steeped in the mythology and fables of Japanese history, it’s another fantastical adventure from the studio with innovation and awe at every turn, despite a story that could benefit from having more specificity and focus.",
    "It offers a powerful metaphor for the manner in which we carry the memories of our departed inside ourselves.",
    "If only there was as much thought put into the characters as there was the visuals. For all of his convoluted backstory, Kubo is a remarkably unconflicted character, and barely faces a moment of internal turmoil throughout the entire film.",
    "The characters feel underdeveloped, to the point where it’s sometimes difficult to remain invested in their triumphs and failures.",
    "Kubo and the Two Strings is lovely to behold, if viewers manage to keep their eyes open. It's an animated doozy and drowser at once, an uncomfortable mix of Miyazaki-style imagination and generic dullness.",
    "What Laika achieves is an effective mixture of hyper-real and hyper-stylized, a combination that keeps “Kubo” appealing to the eye for audiences of all ages. If the film’s plotting and dialogue had measured up, “Kubo” might have been a masterpiece.",
    "Little kids will be bored, as there are only a few scenes with any action, and of those, only one, featuring an enormous skeleton with swords sticking out of its skull, has any oomph."

This film tells the story of a young Japanese boy with storytelling gifts and magical origami skills. He sets out with his friends Monkey & Beetle to discover his family's secrets. While the animation is lovely, the story moves with a humble pace and dramatic nuance that is often slowed by long scenes of gentle dialogue. There are a few modern-style quips tossed about, but this is not a comedy. There's a sweet appeal and a quiet charm, but it ultimately lacks much emotional punch and visual splendor.

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nWhile studio Laika's latest offering contains brilliant detail and painstaking craftsmanship, someone forgot to polish the script and storyline; specifically, there were so many things left unexplained or never fully explained I was left feeling more aggravated than awed. Every time that monkey said \"no more questions,\" I felt like tying her up with unbreakable rope and yelling: \"No, PLEASE ask more questions so I could understand what these filmmakers are trying to say!\" Some specific queries:\rWhy was Beetle cursed as a bug in the first place? Bugs were never a part of the story, so why not just leave him a cursed samurai? Or, better idea: MAKE HIM A TINY ORIGAMI MAN (Just imagine how cool it would have been if a giant origami soldier could have bailed Kubo out of trouble with his paper-folding abilities? Doing so would have rendered Little Hanzo obsolete.) Kubo's mother sacrificed herself by saving Kubo by... I dunno... Blasting him to a far-off region of the snow and transforming herself into a monkey? How exactly does one do that??? Why didn't she come back as a wooden talking monkey as opposed to a real one? Why exactly did Kubo's grandfather want his other eye? (The grandfather gave his reasons, Kubo offered a logical rebuttal, but I'm still not sure who was right and who was wrong...) Most frustrating is the fact that grandfather, hyped up as the main baddie, didn't even show up till the end, so instead we were left with two boring witches who looked like they came from Jack Skellington's Halloween Town. The Grandfather, (aka, The Moon King Raiden,) had confusing intentions, and I'm still not sure why he didn't appear more often if he was supposedly after Kubo's eye. Why do some people use magic and others do not? Why was there a magical shamisen? If the shamisen was so powerful, why weren't all the bad guys after it instead of Kubo? Why was the armor split up and hidden into three video-game-like traps in the first place? (Coraline's hide-and-seek plot could get away with this stuff because it took place in an alternate slightly-Lewis-Carroll world, but it made no sense here.) The biggest question of them all that really annoyed me: if this story's theme centered around the importance of family and people remembering ancestral history.... why in the hell weren't the mom's two sisters ever mentioned again or seen as spirits during the lantern ceremony? The old grandfather who was set up as a cruel heartless individual was later humanized, as the townspeople called him \"a good man.\" Ummmm, didn't this guy commit crimes? Why weren't the two sisters humanized? Did they not have souls too? I'm not sure whether this was a plot hole or misogyny.\r The visuals were impressive, this much I will admit. With its slightly-exaggerated Japanese inspiration and slightly-jerky character movement, there is great charm to stop motion animation. Laika once again delivers masterful detail and believability with their meticulously-posed dolls and sets. I wish filmmakers would have beefed up the Asian flair, because many backgrounds looked too similar to the far-superior \"Coraline.\" Yet, this complaint is a minor one, as most scenes conveyed a feeling of simultaneous ancient and contemporary, such as the opening ocean wave sequence, (which looked like a devil to animate,) as well as every single dream and story-telling sequence. Occasionally, however, things fall flat: what was Kubo fighting at the end of the film? It looked like a giant leech, or those annoying levitating things destroying New York City at the end of \"Avengers.\" Kubo was, I will admit, the most carefully-planned and likable character in the film, and his actions and mannerisms made him very strong without going overboard in know-it-all attitudes (like Coraline in her film or Norman in \"Paranorman.\")\r The end credits was the final nail in the coffin; a nice original melody would have been much appreciated but noooooo, they settle for a George Harrison oldie. And seeing all that traditional 2D animation made me sick that the entire movie wasn't made in this medium. In the future, Laika should make it their goal to focus their attention, not on building detailed puppets and backgrounds, but script-writing. The studio has been on a downward creative spiral since their first feature \"Coraline.\" (Their last effort, \"Boxtrolls,\" was so story-lite I have a hard time remembering what it was about.) Wherever they locked up Henry Sellick, please let him go so he can go back to directing movies again.",

You had to pay attention (or maybe only adults had to since the audience was very quiet, and we had plenty of very small children among us).

If you have kids, take them to see it, it is an excellent film and judging by the trailers for the upcoming family films, this is the best one you will see for a while.

Kubo knows that his father was an acclaimed warrior, who died by saving the eye right of his beloved son of the clutches of his grandfather and therefore, freeze the threat that revolved around his family, nonetheless, the danger is omnipresent as soon as the sun descends. Kubo, Monkey, and Beetle will move on a wild journey in looking for the different parts of the armor of his warrior father to eliminate the ghosts that invade his life of sorrow and bitterness and finally, give a real end to his grim own story.\r If Kubo would like to make use of the charms of the silent film - there is certain initial part in the movie that takes advantage of the muteness - to capture the attention of the spectators would be equally ostentatious, since, it only gives narrative strength - and what solidity! -, it also conceives meticulousness and scrupulousness in each frame, the arduous challenge of photograph and recreate settings, which are recognizable from our idea of reality, makes that the visual inventiveness and the proposal to appreciate the intricate effort provided by each member of the crew intensify. The melancholic individual scenes assimilated the same prestige than an intense action sequence. When you attend to the movie theater, you will be willing to realize of the most intricate details of its production, in case you discover any inaccuracy, however, from the first minutes dazzles us into its blinding landscapes and we forget our purpose radically, because if you must blink, do it now.\r Travis Knight, CEO of Laika, marks his directorial debut (Travis paid attention to every simplicity in the making of the films in order to develop his own movie with the strengths of each production) with a work brought to life with the greatest possible devotion, standing out among other adaptations of Hayao Miyazaki, because it is the only one that has reached to equalize his genuine imagination; This does not make human beings, magicians do it. The hair of monkey, the difficulty to create water ripple, the fascinating origami figures and the invention of the giant skeleton - the largest construction ever made in stop-motion - (all, all is absolutely of flesh and blood!) are reflection of the experience of Knight and he must prepare for the storm of proposals coming for him considering that a talent of this magnitude will not go unnoticed.\r Wabi-sabi is the author of the fluidity in textures of time and movement within the film, the art of seeing the beauty of the imperfect, and I don't mean that aesthetics is imperfect, on the contrary, it is fabulous, but Kubo does not become obsessed in capture detail to detail of Japanese culture, it strives to conceive a tremendously humane story coordinated with the physical reality of the characters and atmospheres ( better appreciated in 3D) captured by the meticulous stop-motion, serving of perfect vehicle for progress in the fleeting story.\r Sincerity, the overcome of death, the value of parents, the acceptance of the maturity and, above all, naive love prevail in every eloquent teaching that the movie wishes to instill. \"Kubo and The Two Strings\" is the animated film of summer, of the year and of the studio; with so many strengths and so few errors, the debut of Knight ensures its place in something more valuable than a golden statuette, \"Kubo\" ensures one place in the mind of each child and in the heart of each adult, simply excellent.",

After all, what other movie have you seen that stars a magical boy, a monkey and a beetle samurai? The odds that you have come across this concept before is pretty unlikely.The movie is basically about a powerful young boy named Kubo (Art Parkinson) who embarks on a journey with his guardian, a.k.a. Monkey (Charlize Theron) and an amnesiac samurai-beetle (Matthew McConaughey) to find magic armour when his grandfather, the Moon King (Ralph Fiennes) comes after him to convert him to the ‘dark side’, so to speak. And if that wasn’t already enough of an all-star cast, Rooney Mara voices Kubo’s two aunts, who are powerful and scary witches, both of who are excellently animated and acted.A strong link in this movie is the beautiful animation, which blends origami and stop-motion animation, which works surprisingly well. Some out-of-place CGI sticks out like a sore thumb, but luckily it is scarcely used.Kubo and the Two Strings is easily Laika’s best movie to date, with stunning animation, excellent voiceover work and one of the most original stories in recent memory.",

Kubo and the two strings went completely under my radar for films to watch. So finally I gave it watch on Netflix.Just from the very few first minutes my eyes were greeted with masterful crafted stop motion. Kubo and the two strings sense of Art direction is something I have ever seen before.Kubo and the two Strings kept my attention throughout the whole film. Never in a moment where I felt this film hit a low point. Every scene either has well choreographed action set pieces or meaningful scenes between our characters. Also how this film paces through its editing style keeps every next cut interestingI never thought I would get such a serious theme from a film like this. I feel it was handles very well as it was being told through the film. Basically I saw two themes here. The major one was that memories are the most powerful thing you could ever have and every story has a end. These two kind of entangle with each other as in the end of the film Kubo honors his parents as passing memory at the ending scene of this film, thus giving Kubo a end to his storyHowever, for the plot of the film I feel it was a little bit of a mashed up adventure with your typical encounters with baddies and with the epic final boss at the end. But for the most part it checks off everything on creating a compelling characters and conflicts.Kubo and the Two Strings is defiantly worth the watch and I encourage all of you to take a night with some popcorn and watch it.",

Their previous work includes Coraline, The Boxtrolls and ParaNorman,Kubo and the Two Strings is the fourth feature film from Studio Laika, the animation studio responsible for some of the best stop motion films of the past couple of years. Their previous work includes Coraline, The Boxtrolls and ParaNorman, all of which have been consistently fantastic, mixing studio Laika's signature stop motion animation with heartfelt stories and memorable characters. And Kubo might just be their best film yet. It's the brilliant kind of family film that doesn't just try to distract kids for an hour and a half, but instead challenges them, whilst also taking us on an epic adventure not quite like any I've seen done through stop motion animation before.\r The films story feels as if it's been ripped right from the pages of a classic fairy-tale. Kubo (Art Parkinson) is a young boy gifted with magical powers that allow him to control paper using his shamisen. At day he uses his powers to tell stories in a nearby town, often telling tales of his father, who was a legendary samurai warrior. Then at night he must return to live with his mother in a cave, as if he wonders out at night Kubo's grandfather, the Moon King (Ralph Fiennes), will find him and steal his remaining eye to make him blind to the world.\r One night Kubo ventures out too long and his grandfather sends his mothers sisters (both played by Rooney Mara) to capture him. Now with the help of a strict and protective monkey (Charlize Theron) that has been bought to life from a wood carving to protect Kubo and Beetle (Matthew McConaghey) who is a samurai that was transformed in to a giant insect man, Kubo sets off on a quest to find his fathers armour and defeat the Moon King.\r They never really explore much what exactly the Moon King's powers are or why they need to find the armour to defeat him. But just like we never need to know where the fairy godmother comes from in Cinderella, we never need a backstory here. We're so caught up enjoying the adventure and are too invested in Kubo's journey to start questioning the logic of this world. Also whilst all the characters of the film play their typical roles, they all play them so well. Our trio of heroes are all hilarious and lovable whilst the villains are genuinely threatening, having an intimidating presence whenever they're on screen in a similar style to the Other Mother from Coraline.\r The story is the stuff of mythical legend, but Kubo's journey in the film is one that we can all relate to. He ends up facing a great deal of loss in the film, which is something that any viewer can relate to in some way. But the film tackles death in a very unique way. Instead of just showing death to be the end, this film serves to remind us that the ones we love will always be with us within the memories that we cherish. That they can live on through us and the stories that we tell. It's a message that might sound difficult and complex for a kids film, but it's told in such an elegant way that it's actually a very accessible message for audiences of all ages.\r Then there's the films breath taking imagery. It's always incredible to see what minds like Pixar are able to do with computer generated animation, but there's something truly special about seeing a film on this scale made using stop motion animation. It's the same reason to love a film like Fury Road over something else that favours CGI. It just looks all the more impressive when it's really there. Plus the epic scale that Laika's undertaken for this production is remarkable. Whilst there is some CGI used, the focus on all the action sequences remains on using real sets and stop motion characters to tell the story. For example, in one stunning sequence Kubo is fighting a giant skeleton to retrieve a sword, which the animators created by using a giant 18 foot puppet in order to capture the scale of the monster.\r Kubo is a rare family film that succeeds at just about everything that it sets out to do. It's both fun and adventurous, whilst also containing a very melancholy tone that's never afraid to take the film in to some dark places. Beyond this, the films ending, particularly its final shot, is something truly beautiful that really must be experienced to be completely understood.",

I loved it like a sibling whose health and well-being I have utmost concern about, and for whom I’d willingly overlook the need to run errands as a mild inconvenience that comes with siblinghood. For whom I’d loan a hundred dollars under the understanding that it IS a loan, then forget about it because that, too, comes with the territory. For whom I’d pick up from their home to drop off, wait for, and return home from the supermarket without asking for gas money (not to mention the unquantifiable compensation for time).\r But I wanted to love it more like a child whose needs I feel obliged to meet without question; whose well-being is not just important, but necessary; whose bright future shouldn’t just be a concern, but assured. I wanted to love it more than I did, but I couldn’t. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a good movie, but to me, it was one of those that was good enough to be better. It was ‘generalistic’ enough that it could fascinate younger audiences, it was deep enough that it could resonate with the more mature, and it was thought-provoking enough that it could appeal to the very cerebral. So why, in the end, wasn’t it even better than it was?\r Kubo himself took centre stage early on, with wails that brought his spent mother to his side. The story goes on to keep him in the spotlight, and throws in a few sidekicks that are as varied, capable, and witty as a light-hearted movie of this nature is intended to be. However, despite the occasional flash back or real-time dialogue, it never gets beyond superficial explanations of anything, leaving you to answer your own questions about everything - if you even bothered to ask. In my opinion, character development could have been deeper, and though I liked the art style, I couldn’t help but wonder if this wasn’t one of those that would have received more critical acclaim if only the sidekicks and the effects alone were CG.\r In the end, it’s a smooth ride at a casual pace with enjoyable music that could put the driver to sleep. Kubo and the Two Strings makes for a fun romp but not a must-see. It brings to an end a summer of non-blockbusters, causing me to postulate that depth is being traded for effects. It delivers an action animated movie with a nebulous storyline that makes me wonder why it wasn’t performed by real characters in the first place! The strumming of the guitar and the telling of the stories might have been a sight to behold if it were performed in person by Neel Sethi or the likes.

Pay careful attention to everything you see no matter how unusual it may seem. If you look away, even for an instant, then our hero will surely perish', delivered by the titular Kubo, accomplishes two things: it creates the movie's all-important emphasis on the idea of stories, and it sets in forth a principle that helps to make Kubo and the Two Strings one of the most interesting and thoughtful movies I've ever seen.  He's not lying; throughout the movie, small details regularly reappear in dramatic fashion, allowing the casual viewer moments of revelation and the experienced cinemagoer the chance to piece things together for themselves.  This masterful planning isn't the only great thing about Kubo, though.\r From the movie's start, it is rich in feeling and characterization, allowing you to understand and quickly grow attached to the various characters.  There is humor, but not so much that it gets irritating or stale, and there is drama, but nothing so dark that kids can't thoroughly enjoy it.  The heroes are all likable, competent, and useful in different ways, and they interact seamlessly together.  The villains manage to be very frightening and threatening.  All of them have personality and their own sort of coolness.  To top it all off, the effort put into the visuals is simply amazing.  This stop-motion marvel is full of incredible shots and moving images, and while there are occasional moments that seem more 'stop-motiony' than usual, I have no complaints.  Some elements of the plot may seem like contrivances, but in the end it makes for a very well-paced movie.  What may seem like a standard quest for three macguffins takes on a completely different tone with story elements of family, humanity, and even mortality, and the ending is very impactful.\r Kubo and the Two Strings, because of its excellent characterization, storytelling, visuals, and emotional experience, achieved a top spot on my list of favorite movies of all time.  I would heartily recommend it.",

I’ve stated for years that Laika could be the biggest competition for Pixar, and finally Laika has delivered a movie to prove me right. Kubo and the Two Strings is beautifully animated, conveys amazing amounts of emotional depth, and brings a true sense of magic. In the past I had been critical of some stop-go animation, but the works of Aardman and Laika have taken it to a premier level.\rThis film’s animation is gorgeous, simply put the characters, the settings, the creatures, they all look amazing. It shouldn’t come as any surprise, Laika has consistently made beautiful films, but it’s always impressive when you consider the amount of time and effort that goes into animating a stop-go animation film. Above the animation the looks of the film is amazing, as the animators used color so well to give the film a look, and even more impressively the animators weren’t afraid to make it dark. That has been one of the best staples of Laika, it’s boldness to be willing to make an animated movie dark (but only to an extent.)\rThe boldness to make the film look dark occasionally, really exemplifies the film’s impressive emotional depth. Much like Pixar, Laika seems to understand that the marshmallow fluff most studios give kids, are very one dimensional. While that fluff is in this film, there’s elements of light horror in this film as well. Any film that can juxtapose kiddy fluff with any kind of horror tones, deserves credit for their depth and understanding of mood. It also helps make this film feel all the more magical, as if the presence of a character can change the mood of an area, which is amazing.\rThe entire film’s look and depth help create a truly magical film, one where imagination seems to be at full capacity for the writers and filmmakers. The film’s villain characters, voiced by Rooney Mara, are creepy and perfectly designed, and the main characters are very well developed as well. This film uses color amazingly, especially blue, which is a common color used in films today, but the use of it in this film both enhances the story and the mood beautifully. Above that the voice work is also incredible, especially the work of Matthew McConaughey and Charlize Theron.\rAll in all, this film is amazing, it may possibly be the best film of the year so far, although it’s still early and Captain America: Civil War was pretty great as well. The story may have been a tad predictable in the end, but the magical look and feel of this animated film transcends a slightly predictable story. For those who love great movie and those who have imaginative young kids, see this in the theaters where the sense of magic can still be felt.",

Except this one stands out far greater than the others, as Kubo and the Two Strings usesTravis Knight takes the director’s chair under the same studio that created other stop-motion spectacles such as Coraline, ParaNorman, and The Boxtrolls. Except this one stands out far greater than the others, as Kubo and the Two Strings uses a classical story to make a tribute to the art of storytelling, in the form of Japanese clay puppets and the old forgotten art of origami.Never before has a story about a one-eyed lonely boy feeding his spiritually lost mother felt so captivating for a contemporary audience. This little restless wanderer takes his journey toward self-worth to a much greater level, as he treats us to a story told within a story with his origami figures, the strings of these puppets controlled by the strings of his musical instrument. Just one sound of the strum, and the paper folds itself to tell of a Moon King who takes a samurai and his family. But young Kubo is not satisfied with his life, as he longs to find his lost father, who he’s been told was once a mighty warrior.All other strides taken by the animators to generate this moving picture are worth the attention of all worldwide art academies. These artists know how to fluidly combine the techniques of stop-motion animation and computer generated imagery in a way that services the artistry rather than the technicality. I am now officially won over upon the concept of combining CGI with Claymation, as everything in the frame of this feature flows and blends together seamlessly, making it impossible to tell what is CGI and what is practical. Kubo is a remarkable feat for 3D viewing.The moments of spectacle in the near-two-hour run time include a moonlit ocean wave split in half, a big scary skeleton with glowing eyes, a large underwater sea creature with a circular mouth, a swordfight with a monster from the afterlife, and two frightening looking ladies who appear merged from V for Vendetta and the twins from The Shining.​With such a love toward the history of storytelling, it’s a shame that the story itself needed some fine tuning here and there, particularly in the second act.After some serious drama, Kubo winds up in some other world coated in snow, a monkey there to greet him. Here is where Kubo begins to feel tonally different from how it was marketed.The next hour contains an excess of humor that for the most part falls flat. The conflict is there between the boy and the authoritative monkey, but by jokes that suggest a genre not previously established. To make it worse, Kubo and the monkey later meet with a beetle who has no memory of his past life. Almost all of his dialogue contains jokes that would get on anybody’s nerves like the class clown you had in fourth grade. The voices of these two mentors to the boy are voiced by Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey, neither of which are that terribly fitting with their parts. But Theron does actually have her moment as she gets to tell a story to Kubo in the classical warm tone as told through memory. I’d also like to add that there is a plot twist involving these two figures, but it’s one of those twists you could have easily guessed.This film’s theme supports the belief of Buddhism, which includes reincarnation and praying to ancestors. If you, like me, are of a Christian or other religious belief, it might be offensive to you. But on the plus side, strong bonds in the feature are made between mother and son, offering children an important moral on the importance of storytelling from generation to generation.I always enjoy a good stop-motion film now and then; it’s such a shame there isn’t nearly enough of them being made nowadays. I think innovative forms of animation such as this one add significantly more meaning and artistry to storytelling, much more impactful than the computer animation we’ve gotten way too used to. Now look, I still enjoy CGI as much as the next guy, but I also enjoy a little variety.This story about stories reveals to us why we go to movies: the stories told reveal our true selves, including which ones appeal to us and which ones we choose to tell. Stories, especially in movie format, live on past our own lives through constant retellings.",

Interesting and fascinating characters are spliced with Japanese folklore bringing together a Hollywood version of a Studio Ghibli production. Kubo is the hero of our story. A story teller himself who longs for the truth behind his parent's demise. In order to unravel the one tale he doesn't know the ending of, he must find a suit of armour, with the help of a talking monkey and beetle, before his evil Grandfather and Aunts find him and steal his eyes. What a truly unusual and unique concept and despite how outrageous it sounds the filmmakers manage to pull it off with glee and without feeling daft. Magic is used without having to be fully explained and that can only be a testament to the world that has been created by Laika studios. Compared to the Pixar films I believe this lacks the family friendly warmth that the character's such as Dory or Sully bring to the screen, however with Kubo we have a new storytelling technique for children. It is dark and unafraid to be so. The story isn't forced and overly explained and it encourages children to take hold of a very different type of narrative. There are still the comedic moments from Beetle and Monkey (McConaughey and Theron excellently bring these characters to life) to keep the children happy but it feels educational with dark themes that encourage new ways to look at life.

The plot isI remember having goosebumps when i first saw the trailer, the visuals, the sound and the plot (which seemed different) caught my attention but i have to say i was very disappointed with the direction this fascinating story took. The plot is good, the love of the parents who wish to save their child from the horror that awaits due to the burden of his lineage...apparently. I can imagine it being a great great story on paper but the forcefully drawn out cliche characters paired with cliche moments and dialogues to fill you with synthetic emotions. \"oh! the poor boy\" \"oh the evil antagonist\" \"oh the confused antagonist\" \"oh the confused boy\", so it tends to leave the entire audience quite confused on how to feel about the movie, the twists it takes and its characters. The plot twists can be seen from light years away, at least for me it was and i was wondering if it is more than just a \"good vs evil\" movie, which would have given it so so much depth but the direction managed to make it annoyingly shallow. I would not take anything away from the stop-motion animation as it was always a visual feast in spite of the confusingly portrayed characters. At the beginning it was all heart warming for me seeing the love of son for his mother and vice-versa but as the movie progresses past the 15 minute mark you start to wonder if they are the same characters you thought you knew. Hence, at this point it becomes very clear that the character development is very disappointing, and i use the word \"disappointing\" because the script deserved so much more than what it got. I believe this was because the creators were torn between making it a kids' movie which they would enjoy and also understand in the simplest form without taking anything away from the interesting plot twists, but it failed to do both. This is a prime example how a great script can be ruined by lack of sincerity and vision and i could not help but feel ecstatic imagining what the same script would have done had it fallen into the hands of someone like Hayao Miyazaki who would know these characters and understand their motivations and enable any kid and child to feel for the in the ways they themselves would not be able to understand how. This just shows how much the western movie makers underestimate their younger audiences. They might as well just give out candies and ice-cream at the end to convince them they had a good time. The morally grey characters are forced to side with either black or white which leaves the audience confused on how to really feel about them. I loved the sound and the visuals but they do not do anything more to compensate for it, which might be asking too much from my side. Regardless the visuals are stunning and sounds soothing but they do not tie well with the overall theme of the movie or the characters. The action sequences are just as dull as the characters and the clashes are pretty basic hand to hand combats all the while trying to convince the audience that they are witnessing a battle of some of the most divine beings of the universe. That pretty much sums up the entire movie for me, everything and everyone seems out of their depth here and i can imagine the sigh the writers much have left with after watching it. Nevertheless, i hope in future, a distant future where we have forgotten about this atrocious attempt to take something so artistic and mold it into something so synthetic just to please the movie audience who are far more sophisticated than they give us credit for. I am also very disappointed to see great reviews for the movie which was not bad, nope, i could not be that heartless but fell extremely short of what it could have been and what it was meant to be.",

It does not have the off-kilter story sense (from a Western perspective) that distinguishes the work of Hayashi and others; this one lies in a land somewhere in between here and there, where events can materialize out of nowhere and sentiment may be called upon to help make the pieces fit.  This is all fine with me, as is the story’s insistence on the importance of storytelling.  What is not fine is the music—in which Kubo’s plucky samishen is nearly drowned out by trite Western “movie music.” No problem, though, with the “photography” (or the art, or whatever a cartoon’s got), which is flat-out beautiful, especially towards the beginning where one has not had the opportunity yet to realize how high the bar is being raised.   All in all, I liked this movie quite a bit and would recommend it without reservation for, say, six-to-ten-year-olds in particular—boys and girls.  Meanwhile, the accompanying adult will be all smiles throughout, except where s/he is agog over the fact that this film is largely stop-motion.",

The story, as always, show us a kid as protagonist, who is gifted and will have to face supernatural forces in order to prove him/herself the inherent value of his/her uniqueness. Here, the storyline is a quest for solving a family conflict, enriched with moments of self-discovery, acknowledging family relationships and learning the importance of memoirs and ancestors. With captivating plot-twists the dynamism is maintained and the protagonist’s process never becomes too dense or tedious. The problematic is without questioning, at the ending, when everything falls in the trap of an animated picture, resolving the conflict childishly and very quickly in order to get everyone happy. When comparing with the outcome in ParaNorman, where forces of good and evil preferred to talk and good showed evil how things actually were with the objective to teach instead of defeat; Kubo did nothing of that, although it could have. Besides that, the most outstanding achievement of this film is the stop motion and visual effects, where body movements and facial expressions are just basics; the natural flow of hair, fur, clothes and origami figures made it a work of art; and the job with the antagonist put this movie in a museum.",

It is no surprise that the film has received accolades for this, as the film'sCompared to other Oscar-nominated animated films I have seen (Zootopia and Moana), Kubo and the Two Strings is far superior when it comes to visual effects. It is no surprise that the film has received accolades for this, as the film's animations and little visual effect tricks are impeccable. As Kubo tells his stories and the papers begin to replicate characters, the visual impact is impeccable and a true testament to the hard work put in by the animators. The cinematography is also breathtaking with the film using the sun and the trees to create a very natural beauty for a film that occurs in such mystical terms. That said, it is not as funny or as adventurous as its animated counterparts and it is this missing element that leaves Kubo and the Two Strings as a good film, but not one that is very good or great.With terrific voice acting from Art Parkinson, Charlize Theron, Matthew McConaughey, Ralph Fiennes, and Rooney Mara, the film sets up a conflict between the Moon King (Fiennes) and Kubo (Parkinson). Kubo, a young boy with magical powers from his mother, is the grandson of the Moon King. However, the Moon King is blind to the world and its pain and desires. He is cold and unwelcoming and wants Kubo to be the same way, so he takes one of his eyes. He tries to take the other, but his mother and father take him away. However, his father is killed, leaving him alone with his magical mother, Sariatu (Theron). Accompanied by his mother as a monkey (it makes sense) and Beetle (Matthew McConaughey), Kubo embarks on a journey to find his father's armor in order to defeat the Moon King. What ensues is a film with great mythology, but is far too predictable. It is a kids movie, yes, but I do not mean the plot. The various little twists are ear marked from the beginning and, yet, the film treats them as if they are incredible and totally unforeseen. This is a shame because the film could have moved through some of these elements quicker and not just relied upon them for surprises.That said, the film's mythology and use of magic is incredible. Not only is it beautifully animated in this regard, but it always instills a sense of awe and incredible power that, for young kids, will make them want to run out and pretend to be Kubo. This is a terrific trait for an animated film aimed at kids and it is one this film has in bunches. It is an incredibly imaginative film that also serves as an introduction to Asian culture and beliefs regarding death and the connection between man and nature. Again, these sequences are brilliantly brought to life, but have even more power in the meaning of these moments and the weight with which it is communicated. This is a film with a deep respect for Asian culture and it shows.Comedically, the film is strongest when Beetle is on the screen. All animated movies must infuse comedy to keep kids engaged and this one is no exception. McConaughey delivers the comedic lines brilliantly and the film drags a bit when he is off the screen. Beetle really gives the film the comedic energy and urgency it desperately needs. On that note, the film can somewhat slack off at times, losing the sense of adventure and pace demanded by its target audience. The film may miss the mark in entertaining children for this reason as the film's comedic introductions are not frequent enough and its story can take a bit too long to reveal itself.More problematically, it is interesting to see this film be let off the hook for its casting. Sure, pile on The Great Wall where Matt Damon plays a white character from Europe that just happens to be in China, but let this one off the hook. All of these characters are voiced by white actors and all of the characters are Asian. This is not something I would detract from the film rating-wise, but how this one escaped controversy is very odd. There are enough good, talented Asian actors that could have fulfilled these roles, so it is a shame to see the film rely on talented, but white actors instead. Shocking that those who are more cognizant of these issues did not raise these concerns regarding these film.That said, the film is impeccably animated with phenomenal visual effects. Its embracing of its mythology and Asian culture is incredible and often quite powerful to watch unfold. That said, its plot \"twists\" are too obvious and the film can drag in parts, while never utilizing its strong supporting cast enough in comparison to the quality they bring to this film. Overall, it is a good film, but lacks that extra bit to make it a great one.",

The story concerns the quest of a Japanese boy to collect three samurai battle gear and to avenge his father's death.\r Pros:\r1) The story is about a boy who earns his living by telling stories to the people in his village. The best scene is when the boy tells a story of a great samurai warrior and one of his adventures, and while doing so, sheets of paper in the boy's knapsack fold themselves into origami shapes that move, fly and float around the boy, so as to illustrate the story better.\r2) The cover of a George Harrison's song is great.\r Cons:\r1) The rest of the film, sort of, degenerates into the usual cliches of stories on Japanese Samurai or Japanese culture, or any quest stories, and it didn't innovate much beyond that. The story would still please the much younger people though.\r2) There are jumps in the story that seems to be attempts to cover up major plot holes. I was lost in the details and plots of some parts of the film.\r3) This Japanese-theme story only had one voice actor of Japanese origin and he is an American citizen (George Takei). Talk about white-washing! I am surprised there hasn't been an uproar on this. Any venture that takes jobs away from struggling actors of non-white origins, regardless of whether it is only voice-acting, is still white-washing!\r4) The arch-villain was disappointing.\r How would the the different age groups view it?\rChildren: Excellent\rTeens: Good\rYoung adults: Average\rMedium age adults: Good\rOld adults: Good\r Rating: 3/5 (no half scores).

The marketing alone showcases most of what is so great about this film; the soundtrack, the voice acting and the animation is all done to perfection. If you can enjoy a movie for its visual presentation alone, this can possibly be considered one of the most enjoyable films ever made. Where the film falls short for me is in the overall storyboarding, the themes it tries to tell and the exposition. The movie establishes early on that the use of origami and Kubo's magical guitar can be used to tell stories and yet we only see this being used effectively once. Other times we have odd and moment-breaking exposition during action sequences, that could have been used so much better in earlier scenes involving Kubo's magic. The twists and turns of this movie also appears out of nowhere with no hinting or foundation for such twists earlier in the movie. The story sort of follows the typical quirky adventure beat, without being smart about laying the foundation for the bits in the second and third act that could have had a much stronger impact. It's a shame, because the story and themes of this movie are well-intended, if not a bit rough in the finished product. All in all Kubo and the two strings is a good watch, that effectively relies on its animation and visual storytelling. The logic and structure of the story is excused by the adventure which is presented, possibly making the movie a spectacular watch for someone less critical than myself.",

Sin duda este estudio, que algunos pronostican que será el próximoOriginalidad es un adjetivo que el estudio Laika se ha ganado a pulso en los últimos años con títulos como la extraña y horripilante “Coraline” o la creativa “Boxtrolls”. Sin duda este estudio, que algunos pronostican que será el próximo Studio Ghibli, acaba de superarse con la épica historia de Kubo y las dos cuerdas mágicas.A Kubo le encanta narrar relatos y se le da realmente bien, pero siempre tiene problemas a la hora de cerrar sus historias con un buen final. De algún modo esta premisa servirá de alegoría a lo largo de un viaje de madurez en el que su vida y la de sus seres queridos se ve puesta en grave peligro. La aventura de Kubo es un relato que sabe mantener un tono sorprendentemente apropiado para edades muy dispares. Como niño sin duda es una aventura trepidante aunque con momentos realmente duros que el guión sabe suavizar con maestría para los más pequeños. A pesar de ello da en el clavo para aquellos con la madurez suficiente para ver lo que hay detrás. Es una película excelente para todas las edades.Kubo es una película que esta atada a la música casi de un modo sinestético y ésta está acompañada de la mejor animación de todo el año y el mejor “stop motion” de los últimos años (sin duda la principal arma del estudio Laika). El doblaje de voz por parte de Charlize Theron como el Mono y Mathew McConaughey como el escarabajo es inmejorable y saben dar vida a dos personajes que acompañan al protagonista en su viaje y se sienten totalmente vivos en pantalla.Hay frames de la película que podrían ser perfectamente un cuadro y tanto la historia como las imágenes que se encargan de contarla dejan boquiabiertos con cada giro del guión y cada nuevo descubrimiento. Trata además temas sorprendentemente maduros que no se ven con tanta frecuencia y recuerdan de un curioso modo al clásico “The iron Giant” y a la aclamada nueva película de J.A Bayona “A Monster Calls”. He de decir que Kubo y las dos cuerdas mágicas es seguramente la mejor adaptación al cine de Zelda que nunca tendremos. No toma elementos del clásico juego pero el ambiente de descubrimiento y aventura que plasma es sin duda muy similar.En definitiva Kubo y las dos cuerdas mágicas es un soplo de aire fresco y devuelve la esperanza que algunos veían perdida con el cierre del estudio Ghibli. Laika sigue así y no nos falles me acabas de regalar mi película favorita de 2016.",
