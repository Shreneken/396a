  "critic_reviews": [
    "A bit \"Up,\" a bit \"Moonrise Kingdom,\" a bit \"Midnight Run,\" even… Taika Waititi’s latest is an oddball treat of a mismatched-buddy pursuit move.",
    "The photography is lush, the dialogue uproarious, and the crazy action sequences unforgettable.",
    "While Hunt For The Wilderpeople is very funny, what makes it stick is the way Waititi allows the relationship between Hec and Ricky to develop slowly, and how nimbly he sets the emotional stakes for both of the characters.",
    "Long story short: Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a terrific movie and you should do whatever you can to see it.",
    "Every once in a while, a small, unheralded film comes along, so smart and funny, such a pleasure to experience, you can't believe your luck. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is such a film.",
    "One of the most sincere and funny portraits of family life to come along in a while.",
    "The best thing the director has going for this one is the talented young actor playing Ricky Baker, as he constantly tries to emulate his tough \"gangsta\" heroes like Tupac Shakur. (He even names his dog \"Tupac.\")",
    "Warmly funny and deeply delightful, Hunt For The Wilderpeople is a tale of two misfits told with such generosity of spirit and consistent good humour that it’s a pleasant surprise to discover how sneakily touching it is as well.",
    "The friendship that develops between Ricky and Hec is priceless; they are each other’s salvation, whether they realize it or not.",
    "Waititi’s film defies its convention through grounded characters, witty dialogue, compassionate filmmaking and inventive storytelling. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is consistently clever and even moving. It’s proof that we’ll keep listening to the familiar stories if they’re this well-told.",
    "Waititi (who’s also responsible for the best comedy of 2015, \"What We Do in the Shadows,\" and will next tackle the third \"Thor\" film) executes a series of deft narrative U-turns, twisting the tale into 101 minutes of pure comic joy.",
    "A film that so perfectly reveals its characters both through the way they charge past calamity, and the way they subtly reflect their own pasts.",
    "Filmmaking this fresh, this vibrant, and this affecting for all ages is rare these days.",
    "Overall this is an absolute pleasure. There are times when Waititi’s script borders on genius.",
    "Warm, witty, and occasionally wild, Waititi’s bush-bonding romp is a kind, generous-spirited winner.",
    "Hunt for the Wilderpeople takes a troika of familiar story types — the plucky kid, the crusty geezer, the nurturing bosom — and strips them of cliché. Charming and funny, it is a drama masquerading as a comedy about an unloved boy whom nobody wants until someone says, Yes, I’ll love him.",
    "Has its share of misfired jokes and pseudo-mythic sequences that semi-fizzle. All in all, though, it’s majestical nonsense that is anything but nonsensical.",
    "[Waititi's] nimble adaptation here combines solid writing with an entire bag of filmmaking tricks that includes visual gags, unexpected cuts and quick montage sequences to score laughs from the get-go. He also cleverly exploits who these people are to get the audience in stitches.",
    "What elevates this conventional tale is how Waititi tells it. With sharp, nimble humor, and one-liners that come a mile a minute, Wilderpeople is a sweet story told with biting wit and an editing style that keeps things going at a rapid pace.",
    "Life in remote parts of New Zealand must forge hardy souls, judging from the characters in Hunt for the Wilderpeople.",
    "Even when it dispenses with realism altogether, Hunt for the Wilderpeople conveys important truths about the will and sheer endurance it takes to make a family.",
    "Polished? Not exactly. Poignant? Definitely.",
    "Works best when it straddles the same line between mild hostility and equally mild affection.",
    "By extension of the film's unending niceness, Waititi has made a movie mired in the middle-ground, a terrain marred by the absence of innovation.",
    "Throughout his films, Waititi has always been skilled at melding comedy with trauma and crafting screenplays with crowdpleasing callbacks. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is another such example of amiable, kind-hearted storytelling.",
    "For the most part, pic’s sheer good-naturedness pulls off a not particularly inspired crusty-old-coot-thawed-by-young-scamp concept, maintaining an agreeable tonal balance despite occasional wobbles between spoof, sentimentality and silliness.",
    "The film is maddeningly uneven. Just as it starts to settle into an inspired groove, it uncorks a couple of gags that fall lethally flat, making for half of a great comedy.",
    "It infuses an outdoorsy survival tale and a coming-of-age story of friendship with Taika Waititi's penchant for distaff flakiness.",
    "Structured in a series of chapters, there is an element of picturebook, even fairytale, enchantment to Hunt for the Wilderpeople. It is easy to be swept up in the adventure of it all, and the comedy and light-heartedness make it eminently watchable but as one narrow escape leads to another, and another, things start to feel a little thin.",
    "As the proceedings grow increasingly more far-fetched, the story starts to feel thinner, any semblance of reality increasingly abandoned. What keeps Hunt for the Wilderpeople afloat are the full-blooded characters that populate it."

The film stars Julian Dennison and Sam Neill and tells the story of an unwanted ward of the country’s foster care system who, as an unloved teenager, finds his way into the lives and hearts of one family. Enhanced by the beautiful scenery of the bush country and the tremendous acting of both young master Dennison and Mr. Neill, the film is an adventure, a comedy and a drama perhaps better suited for a movie of the week on television. That notwithstanding, I give the film an 8 because, when all is said and done, I look back and consider that, by viewing it, I had a satisfying theatrical experience.",

The odd couple is a 13 year old city foster child Ricky“Hunt for the Wilderpeople” is a sweet, sad, funny, drama and comedy small ‘art’ picture that takes the standard odd couple and fish out water stories and stands both on their heads. The odd couple is a 13 year old city foster child Ricky (played by Julian Dennison) and a sixtysomething old country geezer Hec (played by Sam Neill) who is married to Bella (Rima Te Wiata) a Mother Earth who you just know will forgive anything Ricky might or might not do. When he decides to run away and falls asleep not too far away Bella tells him to come in for breakfast before he continues on his journey.\r The film starts off with social worker from Child Welfare Paula (Rachel House) accompanied by a not too swift policeman Andy (Oscar Kightly) dropping Ricky off at the home of Hec and Bella. I don’t want to give away anything as there is a lot of joy as we see/hear the interaction between the characters but one example of where drama and comedy intersect is when Bella shows sheer joy bringing a boar down and Ricky looking in horror. By the way there are a few close your eyes scenes as how people live off the land is shown.\r Julian Dennison as Ricky, the fat—yes it is okay to say that—see the picture!—foster kid couldn’t have been cast by anyone better. I wish Rima Te Wiata had more to do and Sam Neill is perfect as the curmudgeon who has a soft spot in his heart for his wife. Aside from real to life performances of people in the area Rhys Darby as a believable ‘nut’ job with a aluminum hat and can be a tree is no stranger than anyone else in the film.\r I did have a problem getting in sync with the New Zealand accent (sorry Mal, Steve and Karen), where the film was made, for the first half hour but the actors were so good following the story was easy.\r Director Taika Waititi does a perfect balance between all the emotions without playing the audience. His chase scene near the end is unlike most you have seen. The photography by Lachlan Milne of the New Zealand bush is at times breathtaking including a falls scene that I would love to jump into and get to the lake at the bottom.\r The people in this film are all delightful, even the villains, and not a minute of the 101 running minutes will let you down.",

As a result, it looks and sounds fake most of the time. The music for example is a total miss for me. Too loud and artificial when it should have reflected the feelings of the characters. And the balance between comedy and drama is a bit strange to say the least. Many times I wondered if I was supposed to laugh or cry. Overall, it's a completely forgetable movie.

Here, however, it is on point from beginning toAfter being quite mixed on Taika Waititi's previous film, What We Do in the Shadows, I was conflicted heading into Hunt for the Wilderpeople. The humor in his last film was solid, but spotty. Here, however, it is on point from beginning to end. Hunt for the Wilderpeople had me in stitches multiple times and, even better, had a terrific message about adoption, acceptance, and unconventional families. Starring Julian Dennison as the misunderstood and unwanted 13-year old Ricky Baker, the film pairs him with Sam Neill as Uncle Hec. Initially not wanting Ricky in his home, the bond forged between these two is undeniable. Plus, their chemistry together and comedic timing is perfect.\r The film's biggest accomplishment is its characters. The script from Waititi breathes incredible amounts of life into these two oddballs who have both been resoundingly rejected by society, yet have so much to offer. The writing does a great job developing them as people that are thoroughly relatable, which makes the tale all the more heartbreaking. In particular, scenes in which Ricky is shown running away and being unhappy at his new foster home, are incredibly raw. Waititi does a good job to give them a light feeling, but the implication is truly heartwrenching. Aunt Bella (Rima Te Wiata) certainly helps these scenes, as her love for Ricky is clear, even if she just became his foster mother. Her joy over finally having a child she had wanted for so long is infectious and breathes life into the film even when her role dissipates.\r Though two oddballs being thrown together is a typical trope, Hunt for the Wilderpeople executes it so well, it never feels cliche. Rather, it feels deeply real and the thematic musings regarding acceptance, adoption, and our notion of family, is terrific, especially when dealing with why this couple adopted Ricky. Unable to have their own children, they sought a foster child to fill this void. Though not everyone goes through this, the emotional impact of this reveal and the universal understanding showcase that these characters are real people. Authenticity in film matters and when these characters shown unhappiness or elation, it rubs off on the audience and their emotion is our own.\r Comedically, the film is quite strong. Though there are quite a few fat jokes, the film never leans on them too much and bolsters its comedic offerings with a varied and smart take on the youth, people without a proper \"family\", and people who live disconnected from society. Though all serious topics, they are broached comedically and the jokes most certainly work. Waititi has such a quirky sense of humor, which this film displays, but unlike his previous feature, most if not all jokes land as intended.\r A critical darling of the summer, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a touching, funny, and emotional journey of escape, acceptance, and family. It is not hard to see why this one attracted such acclaim, given its incredible characters and light-and-fun approach to its deeply serious topics. On a side note, I almost saw this in theaters. Given the impeccable cinematography in which Waititi lifts a page out of Peter Jackson's book and inserts shots of New Zealand porn, this one would have been incredible on the big screen. Tragically, the local cinema's projector was not working and it was the last weekend for the film in theaters. Anyways, at least I finally saw it!

I loved all his films except the previous one, despite it was a famous title that the world loved, I'm not. So according to me this is a great comeback after a cheap vampire mockumentary. I was very confident that this would take up the New Zealand's the Oscars slot and then disappointed to find it was not in the initial list released by the Academy. Anyway, it does not need a tag like that, it is really an awesome film for everyone, though the theme has some adult contents in an indirect manner and violence like killing the wild animals. That means still it can be watched by kids with their parents' consent.Watching it takes you to the location live, so you don't want to end your vacation in the beautiful New Zealand wilderness which feels like untouched. It was nothing like you have seen in 'The Lord of the Rings' that altered with the computer tricks. This is raw and beautiful like the Tasmanian jungle from 'The Hunter'.This is the story of an orphan boy named Ricky Baker, who is a troublesome. Finally a family from the remote place adopts him where with the initial hiccups, he started to get used to it. But after one of the members dies in his new family, the child service wants him back. This is where it all begins, because he finally found a place where he belongs, but they are trying to take it away from him. So he launches his protest that comes from a mistake which later becomes a national news. What's going to happen to him and the others around him told in the remaining part.\"Sometimes in life it seems like there's no way out. Like a sheep trapped in a maze designed by wolves.\"Seems Ricky is obsessed with the films. He always talks about them and compares his actual state of condition to the different films he had seen and admired. Especially about the gangsters, I think that's why he became so rebellious, apart from his struggles in the orphanage. This film was based on the book called 'Wild Pork and Watercress' and I praise the author for creating a character like Ricky. As usual the screenplay by Taika Waititi was amazing. Not without the support from his crew and especially the actors like who played Ricky. So was the Sam Neill in an important role.First of all it is a fun film, despite whatever they have shown in this like about the feud between the child service and the kid. The film kind of looks like Wes Anderson's 'Moonrise Kingdom' without his signature. Except the initiation, what follows is quite aimless plot. So, not easy to predict the scenes, but somewhat we come to know the ending. It has to conclude either way, like happy or sad ending, or maybe both. But the overall film keeps us in the guessing mode, providing some laughs and thorough good entertainment.It's really an appealing title and so the equally satisfying film. Especially if you like wild and green landscape, you should not miss it. The story was told in chapters which actually did not require, but those slices were helped to understand each section and its focus. I think it was a direct influence from the original source.The director is now on a big leap, doing a superhero film in the Hollywood. The third 'Thor' film, that reunites him with Sam Neill for the second consecutive time. I'm waiting for that which is going to be a visual extravaganza. He has done great with smaller films till now, which are mostly the comedies, but what comes is his biggest challenge so far and if he does pull it off successfully, he would be another Kiwi director in the big league after Peter Jackson. Praying to happen that. In the meantime, I recommend you to check this one out.8/10",

Filled to the brim with loveable characters, quotable dialogue, and pitch perfect performances, especially the two leads, on top of it's wonderfully fresh sense of humor, unique yet solid soundtrack, and a surprisingly beautiful shot here and there, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is genuinely a movie anyone can enjoy, everyone SHOULD enjoy, and is my personal favourite film of 2016.",

It had the perfect balance between comedy and drama. I laughed, I cried. Every component of it was thought out in detail and it worked perfectly! Even while it was funny, it had an overall meaning and made you consider different aspects of society. To be entirely honest, when I first heard what it was about, I wasn't interested but it is now one of my favorite movies I've ever seen. Please, if you have the chance to see it, you must. I guarantee you, you won't regret it. There was absolutely no part where I thought \"well, this could have been better\" or \"that could have been excluded\", it was so so good. From the cinematography to the cast and script, it was perfect, I couldn't have asked for a better movie.",
