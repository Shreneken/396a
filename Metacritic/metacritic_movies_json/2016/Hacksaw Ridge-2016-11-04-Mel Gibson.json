  "summary": "In Okinawa during the bloodiest battle of WWII, Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) saved 75 men without firing or carrying a gun. He was the only American soldier in WWII to fight on the front lines without a weapon, as he believed that while the war was justified, killing was nevertheless wrong.

He was the only American soldier in WWII to fight on the front lines without a weapon, as he believed that while the war was justified, killing was nevertheless wrong. As an army medic, he single-handedly evacuated the wounded from behind enemy lines, braved fire while tending to soldiers and was wounded by a grenade and hit by snipers. Doss was the first conscientious objector awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Hacksaw Ridge is one of the best films of 2016. And the victory is all the more sweet for Gibson in that he succeeds on his own weird terms.",
    "The best war film since \"Saving Private Ryan.\" It is violent, harrowing, heartbreaking and unforgettable. And yes, it was directed by Mel Gibson. He deserves a medal, too.",
    "Though it's a bit of a wobbly mess at times, Hacksaw Ridge ultimately winds up being a deeply moving character study about an unlikely American hero.",
    "Remarkably, Hacksaw Ridge coalesces into a memorable whole.",
    "Thanks to some of the greatest battle scenes ever filmed, Gibson once again shows his staggering gifts as a filmmaker, able to juxtapose savagery with aching tenderness.",
    "Garfield melts into his Doss character in a performance that seems impossibly still and tranquil. He’s mesmerizing. It’s almost impossible to imagine he ever played  Spider-Man.",
    "It’s a movie about bravery and the power of inspiration, be it divine or corporeal, in moments of hopelessness. Desmond’s faith is placed front and center, and the way it operates here celebrates not the object of that faith, but the power it has to motivate both Desmond and his squad.",
    "While derivative and endlessly cheesy, it’s a characteristically visceral return for Gibson, and one that confirms that little has changed in the man’s singular artistic psyche.",
    "Occasionally soapy on the homefront but cataclysmic in combat, this is a worthy addition to the WWII canon. Garfield underpins it all with skill, showing that sometimes, war can be humanising too.",
    "Gibson returns to film’s frontline with a ferociously felt anti-war movie, while Garfield invests his Doss with tremendous conviction.",
    "Say what you will about Mad Mel Gibson, he’s a driven, febrile artist, and there isn’t a second in his war film Hacksaw Ridge — not even the ones that should register as clichés — that doesn’t burn with his peculiar intensity.",
    "Hacksaw Ridge is a fantastically moving and bruising war film that hits you like a raw topside of beef in the face – a kind of primary-coloured Guernica that flourishes on a big screen with a crowd.",
    "Overall, there aren’t many shades of gray in Hacksaw Ridge, but it’s a movie that fulfills its purpose with vigor, confidence and swagger, and those battle scenes are impossible to take your eyes off.",
    "Themes of courage, patriotism, faith and unwavering adherence to personal beliefs have been a constant through Gibson's directing projects, as has a fascination with bloodshed and gore. Those qualities serve this powerful true story of heroism without violence extremely well, overcoming its occasional cliched battle-movie tropes to provide stirring drama.",
    "As repellent a figure as many may still find Gibson, I have to report he’s absolutely hit Hacksaw Ridge out of the park.",
    "Hacksaw Ridge is drenched in the blood of the fallen and the mud forever caked on the boots of those who survived to tell the tale. It’s the closest thing to feeling as though you’ve marched a mile in those shoes.",
    "With Andrew Garfield in the lead role and Mel Gibson in the director’s chair for the first time in 10 years, “Hacksaw” is an incredibly powerful picture once it gets to the battle scenes.",
    "War was both cruel and magnificent, as Churchill once put it. To Gibson, it still is.",
    "Hacksaw Ridge embraces many of the clichés of the war movie but, instead of laying them out in a rote fashion, the film synthesizes them into a visceral, ultimately inspirational result. This is about heroism, patriotism, and an adherence to convictions.",
    "Hacksaw Ridge winds up being a rousing piece of entertainment that also happens to be an affecting portrait of spiritual faith and simple human decency.",
    "Hacksaw Ridge may be too syrupy for cynical tastes and too brutal for the timid.",
    "Despite its promise, Hacksaw never really delves into the moral grays; it’s just black and white and red all over.",
    "One might call this a refinement of Gibson’s fixations as a director: battles more terrifying than \"Braveheart\" and a portrayal of sacrificial lambhood that’s more compelling than \"The Passion Of The Christ,\" in part because Doss, as much of an unwavering do-gooder as he might be, is an actual character with conflicts.",
    "Hacksaw Ridge is faithful to the story of Desmond Doss in every sense of the word.",
    "Brutally intense and elegantly crafted, the film showcases the stellar acting chops of Andrew Garfield and Vince Vaughn, and it’s director Mel Gibson’s best work behind the scenes since 1995’s Oscar best-picture winner Braveheart.",
    "[Gibson's] talent as a filmmaker, Desmond’s story and Garfield’s understated performance make Hacksaw Ridge a good movie, a straightforward story of faith and courage whose complications arise not in the story, but in the telling of it.",
    "As a filmmaker, Gibson understands that there is something fundamentally irreconcilable about Doss’ love of peace, his abject and visceral revulsion at battle and a war movie’s embrace of violence. Somehow, the director has made a film that can contain that contradiction — that remains irreducible. He breaks his own movie, and somehow the movie is better for it.",
    "Desmond Doss was calm, humble and courageous, qualities Mr. Gibson honors but does not share. It is possible to be moved and inspired by Desmond’s exploits while still feeling that his convictions have been exploited, perhaps even betrayed.",
    "It’s gripping, eye-opening and when it comes to heroics, thought-provoking. But it also suffers from grisliness, sentiment and self-indulgence.",
    "The result, though corny at times, treads close to madness and majesty alike, and nobody but Gibson could have made it.",
    "I don’t think you could tell this story properly or honestly without being forthright about the horrors of the Pacific Theater, and as Gibson dramatizes them, they put Doss’ actions in jaggedly sharp perspective.",
    "Hacksaw Ridge returns to the themes which have professionally and personally motivated 60-year-old Gibson for his entire life; he’s never been subtle, but he’s certainly effective when it comes to delivering his heart-felt message.",
    "Hacksaw Ridge is the work of a director possessed by the reality of violence as an unholy yet unavoidable truth.",
    "The war scenes in Hacksaw Ridge, which take up almost half the screen time, are almost on a level with the D-Day invasion sequence from “Saving Private Ryan.”",
    "It feels disingenuous to celebrate Doss' moral code by vividly pretending to demolish it. Nobody disputes the notion that war is hell. But maybe this particular war movie didn't need that.",
    "While Hacksaw Ridge is undeniably made with great care and skill, for all of its good intentions it can never refute that famous Truffaut observation that making an anti-war film is essentially impossible, since to portray something is to ennoble it. In celebrating this legendary pacifist, Gibson and company ennoble the hell out of violence.",
    "True to form, Hacksaw Ridge draws equally on Gibson's bottomless thirst for mayhem and his sincerely held religious beliefs — or some of them, anyway. It's a movie at war with itself.",
    "It is epic in scope, intimate in detail, and otherworldly in its dimensions, like the Bayeux Tapestry with special effects and a stentorian soundtrack.",
    "Vince Vaughn, plainly enjoying himself, plays his casually astonished sergeant, who encourages hazing and beatings of Doss.",
    "It’s a good-if-not-great movie, old fashioned but anachronistic dialogue, action that’s more impressive than inspiring, a combat film that like Eastwood’s Western “Unforgiven,” tries to have it both ways — a sermon against the violence of man delivered in a very violent story.",
    "Gibson has made a movie that is somehow both deeply dishonest and crushingly sincere — and still at war with itself, long after the final shot has been fired.",
    "There are movies based on real events that must be embellished in order to make them work on the big screen. Mel Gibson's World War II drama Hacksaw Ridge is not such a movie. In fact, it's the opposite.",
    "There's no getting away from it, Gibson has produced another bombastic, crowd-pleasing and obviously blood-soaked movie which expertly glorifies that which its hero was against.",
    "It is almost as if Gibson is daring his audience to turn away from his opera of barbarity – but perversely, his violence is the only compelling element of Hacksaw Ridge. Perhaps ironically for a war film, the rest of it is mostly a draw.",
    "This is a work of defiantly simplistic, classically structured Hollywood storytelling, and Mel Gibson takes to its hokey plot points with some gusto.",
    "A blood-soaked, bone-crunching hymn to religious devotion and faith, Hacksaw Ridge doesn’t hum Mel Gibson’s favorite themes; it shouts them.",
    "Along with screenwriters Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight, Gibson, whose lack of directorial subtlety but skill with action both reach an apex here, is not content to tell the true story of Desmond Doss and his unshakeable, courage-giving faith. He wants to convince us that his faith was, in fact, the truth."

Desmond Doss who won the Congressional Medal of Honor for saving 75 men in the Battle of Okinawa during WW2 for those who don'tWow I just watched this movie the other day and it was Insane. I will start with the story which is about Pfc. Desmond Doss who won the Congressional Medal of Honor for saving 75 men in the Battle of Okinawa during WW2 for those who don't know their history. The story is executed perfectly in the roughly 2hr and 15min movie. The first half shows his life and boot camp and the second half the Battle at Hacksaw Ridge. The movie is based on a true story as well which makes it that much more grounded. The acting is tremendously Superb. I mean Andrew Garfield killed it lol. No pun intended. I know some people don't like him but he was great at portraying a convicted individual who's beliefs were being attacked. The other three standouts were Capt. Glover played by Sam Worthington and Sgt. Howell played by Vince Vaughn and finally Tom Doss played by Hugo Weaving. They all were Impeccable in their acting. The action was honestly some of the most Intense I have seen in a Military Movie to date and I have watched a ton of Military films and I have studied military history. The depiction of the battle of Hacksaw Ridge was very authentic and extremely heart palpitating. The Japanese were and are in my opinion the greatest threat that Americans have ever faced in battle. They were extremely formidable and were not afraid to die at any given second. I digress but the battle was bloody and full of shock value but not unrealistic by any sense. The cinematography was honestly perfect in every shot and frame. I will close by saying this is honestly the Best Military movie I have seen to date including in my opinion surpassing \"Saving Private Ryan\" and Mel Gibson as always is a Beast of a director. I was honestly in tears at the end of the movie when they showed the real life interviews of the actual heroes of that real life event. Go and Watch this movie.",

Although there’s only so many times you can see a soldier flying through the air in slow motion before it loses its effect there’s no denying the battle scenes are shockingly brilliant. Based on an incredible true story it’s a must see for Mel Gibson fans. However, you will have to sit through a good 40 minutes introduction that was nearly boring me to tears. If you make it through that it’s all uphill from there. Recommended.",

The movie tells the true story of Pvt. Desmond Doss who was the first conscientious objector to receive a congressional medal of honor.The story itself is fascinating and Gibson does a good job of establishing the characters first. We learn early on what Desmond's motivations and beliefs are and how he carries those beliefs through the duration of the film. It's great that this characterization is handled by Andrew Garfield who is so damned likable in this movie that it's easy to become invested in this incredible story. The cast is also supported by other notable actors like Hugo Weaving, Sam Worthington and Vince Vaughn. I was initially concerned that Vince Vaughn may be an odd fit, however he was a pleasant surprise and sold me on his portrayal of a drill sergeant. These underpinnings and character building make the payoff at the end all the more worthwhile. Desmond's beliefs are tested numerous times especially during basic training. Nothing tries those convictions more however than the carnage of battle. The film doesn't flinch when it comes to depicting the carnage of the battle of Okinawa. The violence and brutality of the pacific theater is shown with disturbing detail. All the gore and carnage highlight Desmond choice to go into battle without a gun. It creates a riveting contrast and in my opinion one of the best films of 2016.",

In The Passion of the Christ, Gibson's much maligned film, he brilliantly captures Jesus and his essence. Though many hate the film, it is a personal favorite of mine. Powerful and brilliantly capturing Jesus through the eyes, rather than words, Gibson's film is one that struck at my very core. Hacksaw Ridge did the exact same thing, but rather than showing Jesus himself, he shows how the words of Jesus and actions of those who follow Him can transform lives. Transcending human definitions of courage, the powerful true story of Desmond Doss - a conscientious objector who saved 75 lives on Hacksaw Ridge as a medic - is a brilliantly told and entirely powerful film. For those who are not religious, the film may come home as hokey and corny, which are fair criticisms. But, as a Christian, I ate it up with a spoon and went back for seconds.Perhaps the biggest flaw of Hacksaw Ridge is how it wears its influences on its sleeve. In particular, Full Metal Jacket. With the first half being set in basic training with a hard-nosed and funny drill instructor, Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn), and the second half coming full force with violence, explosions, and shooting, the film lacks the thematic ruminations of Full Metal Jacket while embracing their visceral impact. It is hardly original in this set-up and it is unfortunate that Gibson just ripped off that film - it transcends influence - and gave it his religious twist. The film's first half is also further maligned by cliches with the introduction of Doss's wife, Dorothy (Teresa Palmer). Sweet and romantic, the romance always feel incredibly nostalgic and innocent, but never really feeds into his character development too much. The picture in the Bible or the picture as a \"Oh wait, I almost forgot\" gift from a girlfriend to her boyfriend heading off to war is a tried and true cliche that is about reaching the end of its run too, right? The cliches of the first half and then the Full Metal Jacket structure render the first half largely being the weaker one by far.Fortunately, the second half is impeccable. Bloody and brutal, the film's violence can be a bit numbing, but is beautifully captured. Expert staging and choreography plus brilliant cinematography with an emphasis on the greens and browns of battle and bombs, contrasted by the deep blood red of violence, the film is absolutely terrific. It may be a bit comically over-the-top, but Gibson painstakingly captures both the strategy and the violence of war, infusing it all with great tension and thrills. While many cite the second half as being far weaker (as they do with Full Metal Jacket), it is brilliant in my opinion. Yet, one of its greatest complaints is how it contrasts with the first half and the pacifism on display there. Personally, I see no issue. Desmond wanted to go to war and this is war. He knew there would be blood, so the audience and the film understand there must be blood. It is a war film and though Doss's tale is vastly different than many other soldiers, it still must show the brutal reality of war and Gibson does so brilliantly.Yet, the film finds its greatest power in the last half hour. As Doss races back and saves 75 different men, painfully lowering them down the ridge after his own men had long gone aside from two guards, the film turns into Church. Begging God to let him save one more and asking God what his purpose is in this battle, the film is moving, powerful, and entirely resonant. Though a bit preachy, Gibson's film shows the struggle for Christians in violent situations or the world as a whole. With chaos all around, how do we live up to Jesus' example? Where are we needed and what is our purpose in this world? Doss is confronted with these questions in the heat of the moment and must act quickly, performing what he believes to be God's purpose for him in war. With his bravery and courage quietly performed, Doss is a man that serves as pure inspiration for anybody searching for this purpose in this world as an agent of God or anybody seeking to be brave in an unconventional fashion.A striking tale of bravery with a tinge of pacifism and an anti-war message, Hacksaw Ridge is a powerful, riveting, and truly gorgeous film. Just as with The Passion of the Christ, it play more resoundingly with Christian audiences, but it is a great war film in its own right. It may be too cliched and influenced by other war films at points, but Gibson knows violence and uses that knowledge to craft brilliantly smart battle sequences that resonate nearly as much as its appeals to its Christian target audience. Hokey and corny, Hacksaw Ridge is the cinematic version of Church and plays strongly at fears of Christian persecution. Yet, in spite of that, it is undeniably powerful and a terrific film for audiences willing to go along with its spiritual core.",

Gibson's directorial prowess throughout this sequence is so absorbing and effective that it very easily removes any memory of the shortcomings dwelling within the film's opening moments, giving the viewer the inspiringly resonant experience they signed up to receive.

The special effectsOn the battlefront, his intention was to save the lives.The film was awesome, mainly because of the good message it carried out. That's not it, the film was well made with the wonderful cast and their great performances. The special effects were top notch, as well as the location where the majority of the second half takes place. This is a US-Australian co-production. Mel Gibson returned to the director's chair with a bang after exactly a decade. It got six Oscars nominees, so let's wait and see how many awards it grabs.It was the World War II theme, based on a real person and events. It tells the story of an American youngster named Desmond Doss, who joins the army to contribute to his nation. But for his religious point of view, he struggles during the training. After managing to make through, the remaining film focused to reveal his bravery on the battlefield against the Japanese armed forces at Okinawa in a place called Hacsaw Ridge.The story was based on one of the ten commandments. Doss, who strongly believes in that carries the same ideology to the combat zone. But all the initial part of the film reflects why he is very on to it. Especially after a fight with his brother in his childhood, followed by saving a severely injured man in a road accident just before deciding to join the army. So it is like both, a war film, as well as an anti-war theme. Most importantly, it tells us the bravery of a man, like of something Gandhi in the battlefield.He did it in what he had believed, but my perspective differs. I liked the film, as a biopic and the message it delivered. Very entertaining too, but when it comes to Doss' belief, I think it was flawed. In the first place he would have not joined the army if he's true to the commandment. That's the basic rule of the commandment if one wants to adopt it.He was just one of the unique person with such idea and luckily succeeded following it in a hostile situation. Only if you think all his episodes from an atheist perspective, that's how you would feel. One of the major reasons for that is, when he saves his men by letting his enemy die. But appreciable effort, at least from the Americans perspective. A true hero for his nation. One of the best war films ever. Instead of saying a must see film, I would say don't miss it.7.5/10",

At the core of the movie, its about faith, despite all the blood and carnage, it's a very christian film. \"Help me get one more..\" Doss prays, \"Just help me get one more..\" as he crawls through the grime and corpse filled landscape, like a saint going through the gates of hell.

Now I'm a big WWII nut, I love the time period, and as much as I know about it, this story was nothing but unknown to me, but I now know a big part of the battle of Okinawa a little bit more clearly. Hacksaw Ridge is culmination of what it's like to have something as your beliefs tested and questioned while struggling to stay faithful in what you believe in. The film itself is a shockingly realistic re-enactment of of the pinnacle of the pacific theater of war during WWII, Mel Gibson re-catches the attention of the world as he makes his comeback to the directing world with a film so emotionally deep and such frighteningly realistic scenes of brutal war violence that it's easily comparable to Saving Private Ryan when it comes to showing the audience what it's like to see the horrors of war through someone else's eyes. Andrew Garfield surprised me so much, he really held the film up, when I first heard he was going to have the lead role I was very nervous because his role as Spider-Man in the Amazing Spider-Man films was not that great so to hear that he was taking the helm in a very serious role such as Desmond Doss made me very skeptical of how he might portray his character in this film, but after seeing this film I was totally blown away by how much dedication he gave to Desmond, honestly if he does not get at least a Golden Globe or Oscar Nomination I will be really mad. The supporting cast was amazing, I was surprised to see Vince Vaughn in serious role compared to comedian Hollywood normally views him as. Sam Worthington was also amazing, before this, I have not seen him in very many movies since Avatar but this was definitely one of his better roles that he has ever done. As for Luke Bracey, Hugo Weaving, and Teresa Palmer, they were also amazing in the roles they had. The acting in this film is one the best aspects of the film, but to me what really made this film unbelievably great was the cinematography, the production design, and the make-up made this film really shine with undeniably realistic and graphic battle scenes, beautiful wide shots, and the gore in this film is so gruesome that it's very difficult to forget it all, but that's how war is. Out of all the World War II films I have seen in my life, Hacksaw Ridge is now one of my favorite WWII films I have ever seen, and I am very impressed with Mel Gibson's directing work in this film, I can't wait to see other films in the future that he will direct because Hacksaw Ridge is in my opinion a unforgettable masterpiece, and one of Mel Gibson's best director work since Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ. Hacksaw Ridge is a film to remember in the coming future.",

I didn't particularly enjoy the first hour of the movie, but boy, did the second hour make up for it.Plot: As I mentioned, the first hour of the movie was very melodramatic as well as cliched and borderline boring. It's a typical love story, everything works out conveniently, and some of the line delivery and scenes are cheesy. However, the second hour is pure brutality and war violence, that is so well done and filmed excellently. It was like watching two completely different movies (like Full Metal Jacket but not executed quite as well). But, the advantage of having the first half so happy and dandy, it makes the second half so much more brutal, which I'm not sure is intentional or not. Otherwise, the second half was done well; shot perfectly, great sound editing and mixing, good enough story. It's just the first half that brings the score down a bit.Characters/Acting: Andrew Garfield did an excellent job, earning the Oscar nomination. Do I think he should win? No, but he deserves the recognition. Otherwise, the acting from the supporting cast was good, but it was mainly a showcase of Garfield's character and acting. I didn't like Vince Vaughn's portrayal of an army sergeant. I didn't think he was fit at all for the role, and didn't seem menacing enough to be a drill sergeant. The problem is, when he insults all the privates when prepping them, it feels very Hollywood and doesn't match the lighthearted tone the first half of the movie had. Full Metal Jacket actually had a matching tone and, although funny, it made you feel uncertain about whether or not you should laugh. Vince Vaughn just looks like too funny or nice of a guy to be seriously shouting insults as a sergeant.Cinematography: The cinematography was great in Hacksaw Ridge. It captured the sheer brutality of war, and the action was amazingly directed. As controversial as Mel Gibson may be, he knows how to direct action and warfare.Other: The movie was a bit heavy-handed; there were plenty of Jesus allegories throughout the run-time of the film that can be seen as propaganda. For example, there's a scene of Garfield having water poured onto him as he looks up at the sky, arms at his side, being cleansed of the blood that cakes his skin, all in slow-motion, while emotional music plays. I also didn't enjoy the depiction of the Japanese. They are portrayed as absolutely ferocious, disgusting, ugly creatures that MURICA must defeat. Their caricatures are exaggerated and Gibson really tries to get the point across that the Japanese are the bad guys, and you should be rooting for MURICA.Overall, Hacksaw Ridge is half cheesy-cliche, half brutal, well done, action. This is not a movie for the squeamish.",

Oftentimes overlooked; Andrew Garfield has put his talent on the line and *fingers crossed* will continue to be given the opportunity to shine in large future projects. By the time credits start rolling, you will need (atleast) a few more minutes to digest what you have just seen to fully process the heart-wrenching tragedy/reality of war and the heroic young man that dared to push against the grain.

The film is about a soldier that refuses to carry a weapon, the fight for his decision and its display at war. Like his previous works, we face an event in history of humankind, but from the point of view of one single individual. The focus for the protagonist is something characteristic in Gibson’s movies; the evaluation of human character at its daily basis, because the human concept has been lost through centuries, that’s why we start this journey with the sacrifice of Jesus, accompany the fight of William Wallace and escape beside Jaguar Paw, to finally rescue in battle with Desmond Doss. Here you discover that the real human is the one that stands by its own beliefs, fights for justice, defend the weak and takes care for his kind, but also struggles with inner and outer troubles, inner like pride, doubt, overconfidence, even innocence; and outer like discrimination, ignorance, fear. So hesitation is allow, questioning the act, feelings and thoughts; however the objective from the protagonist is enormous, bigger that himself and for that reason he moves forward no matter what. Mel Gibson is known for the strong direction, without reluctance on showing how it really was, and this film is no exception. There are amazing camera shots here, to details like finger on the trigger, spilled blood, lacerated limbs, mice eating human remains and many more; all these in order to portray the war more accurately and vividly, like nothing you have seen before or even can imagine. There are no words to describe the great performance of Andrew Garfield and Hugo Weaving or the epic soundtrack.",

This is truly the most visceral and engaging war movie since \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998). First off, I have to commend Mel Gibson for his beautiful direction. Say what you want about the man, but he knows how to engage an audience through gripping visuals and interesting characters. Which leads me to the performances. I was surprised to see great performances from the entire cast. Initially, I was anxious to see Teresa Palmer and Vince Vaughn in this movie, but they both surprisingly fit into the movie almost seamlessly. A particular standout is Hugo Weaving. His performance was a bit too real for me and reminded me of a man that I know that was very similar to Weaving's character. Nevertheless, I found him to be one of the best characters in this movie. But the big standout is Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss. Garfield brings a child-like personality into the role. We see Doss learn how violence can really take a toll on one's inner self which is what makes him the man he becomes as the film plays out. It also tests his own morals and how despite the trials tribulations faced that stand in his way, he still stays true to what he believes. Easily one of the most fascinating characters portrayed this year thanks in large part to Garfield's performance. Finally, let's talk about the war sequences in the film. In a nutshell, they are powerful. Like I mentioned, it the most visceral war film since \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998). The war sequences are very hard to watch and can leave you feeling sick. However, it is all portrayed beautifully. Even more fascinating are the moments in which we follow Doss through the war and see how his morals come into play. Both halves of the movie are completely different, but they both help structure our main character and show how he deals with both basic training and the war itself. In regards to flaws, only a couple of moments at the beginning of the film felt very conventionally. However, as the film plays on, it continuously becomes more of an experience as opposed to watching a made for TV movie. Overall, this is a fascinating war drama with a great story and a terrific leading character. I give \"Hacksaw Ridge\" an A! Definitely check this one out.",

Not even his previous war film We Were Soldiers could reach the same heights as this, maybe because the subject matter is something more of a celebration to the true heroes of war, the Medics on the battlefield.World War 2 Medic Private Desmond T. Doss, played absolutely brilliantly here by Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spiderman) is the centrepiece of the film. We not only get a taste of how amazing Garfield’s acting chops are stretched through grindingly raw and emotional strength, but we can learn to love a usually hard to master Virginian accent without wanting to cringe and in-fact I didn’t even notice the accent a few minutes in due to how much the story and my perspective changed from that of criticism to pure enjoyment. This true story of Doss, who won the Congressional Medal of Honour despite refusing to bear arms during the entirety of WWII (even training) on religious grounds and is astounding to behold due to him never faltering from his faith and beliefs. Doss was drafted and ostracized by his fellow soldiers (he was beaten and belittled for most of his training), for his pacifist stance for most of his time with the company. That was until Okinawa. The movie really doesn’t hold too many surprises in the form of plot if you know about the battle of Okinawa Japan in the horrific times of the Pacific War of World War 2. But what separates this war story from the norm is the heroics and bravery of Doss and when Doss and his company reach the shores of Okinawa and realise their orders are to climb to the top of Hacksaw Ridge, little do they know the horrors that are at its summit. Underground caves and tunnel systems the Japanese use to hide and ambush allied soldiers to force them back over the edge. Over 1500 men were killed just on this very cliff face. Doss however, went on to earn respect and adoration for his bravery, selflessness and compassion after he risked his life without firing a single shot from a weapon and saving 75 men in the Battle of Okinawa. If you’re an Atheist like me, some things may feel very heavy on the religious themes of the film, but they are never forced upon you and quite frankly are welcomed due to the very foundations of Doss and his character. I have witnessed a lot of religious people in my time taking the context of the bible and using it the wrong way, but Doss and his beliefs are so grounded and he sticks to every single one without sway, for that I was proud to listen to everything the film and Doss has to say.Other than Garfield, most of the cast does a fantastic job with their roles. It is so hard to fault anyone when there is so much passion in a project such as this. Highlights for me were Vince Vaughn playing bad ass Sergeant Howle and seeing our very own Aussie’s Hugo Weaving (fingers crossed for Best Supporting Role Oscar), Rachel Griffiths and Ben Mingay (Packed to The Rafters, Home & Away) among many other Aussies (This was filmed over 100 days in our very own backyard of NSW) also see if you can catch Ryan Corr and Mel Gibson’s very own son Milo Gibson.The music of the film is a true testament to how scoring a film should be done. How Rupert Gregson-Williams keeps such a booming score fairly low key throughout is fantastic and yet it whispers underneath key moments that are so subtle but leave an almost haunting effect. The visual effects, camera-work and Cinematography by Simon Duggan (The Great Gatsby) in the film is another overwhelming achievement. I was prepared to go in for a Zack Snyder Esque’ nuance of over the top, slow motion madness and I am so glad I didn’t get it mostly throughout the entire film, at least until it was welcomed towards the end with amazing effect during the final few moments of the siege.Rumours are true, Mel Gibson is back and in fine form, it really is a feat in its own right with the troubled stars recent bad past. With some great starring roles as of late, it is nice to see he hasn’t lost his touch behind the camera. Apart from one of my all-time favourite films The Water Diviner (Andrew Knight wrote the screenplay and does so again for Hacksaw Ridge), not since Gibson’s very own Braveheart and Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan have we witnessed the horror and beauty of war with such Grandeur.",

Here is what Ben Affleck should have done with Batman. Here is a true hero that outshines anyone wearing a colorful, shiny million dollar suit. In fact, all he has to suit him up and protect him from death is the holy word of God. He won’t even dream of laying either an eye or a finger on a rifle. If today’s superheroes can’t help us through gun control, then this real-life hero of Hacksaw Ridge can.Just the first opening sequence alone is enough to tear your heart open and make a home there. Images of the battle on Hacksaw Ridge show the brutality of the historical event: there are more corpses than living souls, rats have arrived to feast off the remains, blowtorches incinerate whoever is left alive, and the heavy-handed music reminds you of what each soldier had to leave to fight for the important things.The story kicks off in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, where one boy goes too far in a fist-fight with his brother, nearly killing him with a brick to the forehead. Reminded of the antiviolence account of Cain and Abel, Desmond Doss feels immediate remorse for what he committed against his brother, and vows never to get involved with violence again.At a much older age, Desmond finds love with a local nurse who has seen soldiers return from World War II. Their romance from here is as sweet and believable as any man would remember his first relationship, complete with a bluejay feather to represent the delicacy of their love. It seems here like director Mel Gibson is returning to his old bags of tricks with the romantic plot of Braveheart, but the vulnerable Church-boy accent by main actor Andrew Garfield wins over both men and women.These small personal touches set up exactly why we should care about the tragic events that happen later, proving exactly what Gibson most succeeds at as a director. He’s not even afraid to put in some comic relief when it’s time for Desmond to join the army, where one of the first soldiers he meets is a narcissistic bodybuilder who loves exercising in the nude (except when it’s time for training). But once he opens up at Fort Jackson about being a pacifist, everything stops being funny. He won’t even tie a noose knot without it coming out shaped more like a heart. The rest of the army found it completely unthinkable that a soldier was enlisting with no ambition to even touch a gun, so what happens from here is a multitude of mixed emotions and unclear answers.Hacksaw Ridge may seem at first like the typical war movie that resorts to the usual tropes, but experiencing the film proves how it does everything a gigantic leap further from the clichés. The drill sergeant, along with firing out his expected racist insults, also shows his compassionate side when necessary, and the war hero is not depicted as being purely in the right. Rather, he has one thing that’s getting in the way of him serving graciously on the battlefield: his pride in his pacifism.That is why on the day of the first battle at Okinawa, it takes a chaotic series of uncomfortably long warfare segments to put this man of God to the test. This recreation of real events show us how this underestimated unarmed soldier saved hundreds of lives just by sticking to the word of God. You’ll be surprised even by how he treats the “enemy” that the army is sent to Hacksaw Ridge to destroy.It’s not every day a movie like this comes around: a movie that tells one of the most inspiring true stories to come out of the darkest period of man’s history. While everyone else in this nation is concerned about unreliable self-righteous heroes like Batman, Superman, Captain America, Spider-Man, here is a hero who knows the importance of putting other lives ahead of his own, committing his service to unconditional love rather than destruction. Therefore, I encourage the instant-classic Hacksaw Ridge as immediate viewing to all, for the sake of our country and our definition of heroism.",

Look at the vast majority of Christian faith-based films and they have ridiculously high ratings.  Why?  Because the only people watching are Christians who buy into that kind of melodramatic, bad acting, vapid story-telling.  No objective observer could watch Hacksaw Ridge and Saving Private Ryan and rate them both a 10.  Saving Private Ryan is incredible.  It has character depth, amazing acting, an intricate storyline, and true to life historical accuracy.  Hacksaw Ridge in the first half is preachy with a bad actor in Garfield, and the second half is mindless violence watching scores of people die, including American soldiers we know nothing about and therefore have no emotional connection to.  The contrast in Saving Private Ryan is that they develop their characters.  So when you see one of them die, you are genuinely moved to tears.  Hacksaw is a farce.  Garfield is a terrible actor.  And this story is ridiculously filmed and directed.  Even IF the loose story this is based on is worth retelling, this movie did it ZERO justice.  This movie is the equivalent of \"Jesus take the wheel.\"  Well, I hate to say it, but Jesus is terrible at making compelling war movies.",

The biggest BUTS for me are some cheesy scenes (so common in this type of films) and Gibson´s obsession with blood and religion. Two things that really put me off in general.

Some takes on it–and more so, certain elements encapsulated within it–are likely philosophically self-reverential and a demonstration of current modern angst toward what those individuals may term as traditionalism, but I see it rather differently.   Does the director use a hand that is too heavy?  I do not believe so at all.  Filmmakers the likes of Oliver Stone and James Cameron tend to bludgeon one over the head.  Mel Gibson is not of the same cloth.  While in Hacksaw Ridge he was clearly acknowledging that what Desmond Doss did was miraculous in and of itself, he was also allowing for the view that Mr. Doss himself had toward prayer, faith and divinity.  Such was clearly part of the man and the film is simply being honest in presenting that.  The viewer may take from it what the viewer will.   The film is certainly not easy to watch at times, but it is exceedingly well-made and quite affecting.",

This ultimately becomes the caseWhen reviewing this film i was faced once again by a dilemma i never thought i would ever see again after watching snowpiecer, in which a film in the sum of it's parts is as terrible as it is amazing to watch. This ultimately becomes the case with Hacksaw Ridge a film with action bloody enough to be compared to the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan, but ultimately weighed down by a religious agenda that feels just as pushy as the film God isn't dead. Now be warned that when watching this film that the first hour or so feels especially slow and at the same time rushed with characters stepping into the light about once or twice to share there story and then to move of the stage to stand within obscurity for the rest of the film and this becomes quite unfortunate as stand out actors such as Hugo Weaving delivering an oscar worthy performances with large degrees of pathos and ambition in his minimal role to then only disappear into the plot. In addition as mentioned before this film is a christian agenda pushing film and although it has my respect as being a true story of a Seven Day Adventist, even myself as a christian (though not devout) found Gibson to have somewhat of agenda in filming this movie with a reference to God being dropped every minute into the film which eventually becomes overly repetitious and ultimately makes me feel less sympathic to the character even despite the weight of the Desmond's heroic actions in real life. However if you're able to make it past the first hour or so what you are left with is a war movie that is about as memorable as it is at some stage even terrifying in scope of the bloodshed and tenacity of the Japanese empire who serve as intimidating foes.Performances are A grade within this film with standout's being Andrew Garfield, Newcomer Luke Bracy, Hugo Weaving as mentioned before and even surprisingly Vice Vaughn who prior to viewing the film made jokes about in reference to his typecast characters being involved in war. The only thing that i fundamentally found lacking about the characters within the film was perhaps the romance between Palmer and Garfield's characters within the film in which i had found that although they were indeed trying their absolute best has little chemistry with one another. I was also glad to see myself rooting for just about ever character in the end to make it out of the hacksaw ridge and turning my head away when characters got killed in the most horrifying of ways. Ultimately Hacksaw Ridge is a tale of the human endevour and while it has a slow premise with a tacked on religious agenda It is ultimately definitely worth watching even for the final hour.",

Some ofHacksaw Ridge is a pretty good film that relies almost entirely on the face of Andrew Garfield.  If you are not moved by his face, his look, his expressions, the film will fail you completely.The film is hampered by several things.  Some of the dialog is second-rate and here and there steps out of period to make use of easy modernisms.  Some of the basic training sequences come across as unlikely.  The bit about somebody's father appealing to a higher authority to get somebody out of trouble may or may not have actually happened back in the 1940s, but since then we've seen this kind of thing in a great many films and as plot devices go it has not improved with age.Also, just because it irks me, late in the film our main character, Desmond Doss, remarks to another soldier, \"I never told you I'm not crazy,\" despite the fact that he said almost those very words--\"I'm not crazy\"--to an army doctor evaluating Doss' mental fitness for the Army.Another issue:  a great deal of the battle seen on screen focuses on the fighting, the shooting, the explosions, and oh by the way there's this medic over yonder who's running around saving people.  Well, yeah, Mr. Gibson, that's supposed to be your main character and the whole point of the movie.There's a scene near the end where we cut to a Japanese commander in time to see him commit suicide.  It's the first time we see him, as far as I recall, and why we see him at all I don't know, unless maybe someone felt a need to show a Japanese officer killing himself with a dagger--which is odd because I always thought it was women samurai who did it with a dagger.In any case, the final half hour or so is mostly centered on Doss as he rescues dozens of wounded soldiers.  It's a pretty good sequence.  Again, Andrew Garfield's face makes it believable, or not, and the film succeeds or fails based on how you react to that face.I won't bother mentioning the boarding net.  It's hung down the side of a cliff.  And no matter how many times the Marines use it to climb onto the \"ridge\" the Japanese never seem to get around to cutting the net down.I might've given Hacksaw an 8 but for the flaws.

The trailers didn't help at all, as it made the film look corny and very award bait. But guys trust on this, it's nothing like that. There's nothing glamorous about this. When it was over, I left was speechless. This is such a great movie.Say what you want about Mel Gibson controversial past and behavior, but I think we must judge the art, not the artist. This guy is an excellent director and a great actor. And you have no idea how glad I am seeing Mel back, as he is the most talented man in Hollywood right now. The most impressive part of Mel's directing in this movie (besides the battle scenes), is he's decision of an old version approach to the film making. The movie literally looks and feels like it was made around the 50's. Also how Gibson would let actors deliver the emotion of what their feeling and it could meant a lot of things that isn't just terrified. It could be happy, regret, or just thinking of home. And I got all of that.Andrew Garfield is an actor that's been non-stop blowing me away recently. And he gives one hell of performance as Desmond Doss. I would say it's one of his best since \"The Social Network\". Even in the battle scenes I thought he was brilliant, as he had this scared, tired, but brave look to him. He's accent in the film I thought worked pretty well and wasn't distracting like I thought it would. The chemistry between Garfield and Teresa Palmer was so charming and sweet that it didn't came of too corny.Hugo Weaving plays Desmond father in the movie and he was outstanding. Such a powerful and emotional heavy performance. Weaving is the type of actor that deserves so much respect. I mean, we all know him as Agent Smith, V, Megatron, Elrond, and Red Skull. But for him to give a small supporting performance as the alcoholic father who's dealing with conflicted within was quite moving.Vince Vaughn was so good in this movie that I wish he would come back for dramatic roles, as I really did brought his performance in this. The comedic one lines were pure gold and it was very \"Full Metal Jacket\". But he isn't like that the whole movie. When he's serious in the movie, it actually works and doesn't feel out of place for the rest of the tone.Now the battle scenes in the movie...wow, it's pretty rough and disturbing. It's right up there with \"Saving Private Ryan\" for graphic and shocking depictions. What I always love in these type of War films is the loud sound, actors, and the camera work, which this movie nails at. I've heard some people say that the movie glorify's it's violence despite the theme of the movie being against violence. I honestly think these people have really missed the point here. All the battle scenes are depicted more as this horrible event than a flawless victory.After the movie was over, everyone in the cinema started clapping. The last time that happened was when in saw \"Up\" back in 2009. While I never saw the point of clapping or booing at a movie, but for this occasion, I'll let it Slide. The ending was a very nice touch and pretty heartfelt to honor the soldiers that fought in the war. It was deserved.I haven't got a lot of issues with the movie. But if had to pick, I would probably say that Sam Worthington Australia accent kept slipping in and out in a few scenes. And don't get me wrong, Worthington isn't bad in the movie, but he was pretty good. The same can go to some of cast (as most of them are Australia), but I can easily look past it as the actual performances were all great.Overall rating: \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is not perfect, but it positives really do weigh out it's flaws. It's the best War movie I've seen in awhile in terms of it's execution and pay off.",

Not that the family/character study stuff is bad, far from it, it's beautifully filmed, even better acted and paints Doss as a very fascinating character that it's easy from the get go to identify with his wants to succeed against all catastrophic odds.Just that the first third does take time to get going with a pedestrian pace, the dialogue is corny (in fact, to me the dialogue is the least good thing about 'Hacksaw Ridge' in general and the element that rings true the least) and the sentimentality is laid too thick (this is also particularly true in the slightly underdeveloped romance).However this is made up for by the entertaining yet hard-hitting training scenes and in particular the truly jaw-droppingly brutal war/battle scenes that soar in nerve-shredding intensity and raw emotion, giving the first 30 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan' a run for its money and perhaps making it tame in comparison (high praise for a film with one of the most gut-wrenching first 30 minutes on film, though to me the rest of the film isn't quite as good).Throughout 'Hacksaw Ridge' has exceptional production values, in particular the cinematography in the battle scenes, and Gibson directs like his life was depending on it. Rupert Gregson-Williams' score has the right amount of pulsating energy and nuance, and the sound effects in the war/battle scenes have a terrifying authenticity.For a vast majority of the time, the story is very compelling and makes the most of mature and very easy to relate with themes. It has a wide range of emotional impact, being for the second half intensely powerful, much of the film being poignant, some of it sardonically amusing (without it being out of place) and also all of it inspirational. Rather than straying from the facts for dramatic license, Gibson is surprisingly respectful this time round.Andrew Garfield has yet to give a better performance than his astonishing turn here (though he is splendid too in Martin Scorsese's 'Silence'), and Gibson similarly brings the best out of Sam Worthington (often a charisma-free actor but here doubts were cast aside) and Vince Vaughn (at his sardonic best while also touchingly subdued, proof that he can be good if the material serves him all which too often in his career it hasn't but it does brilliantly here). Hugo Weaving is terrific, also giving some of his best work in some time. Teresa Palmer makes the most of her role.In conclusion, a near-triumphant come-back. 8/10 Bethany Cox",
