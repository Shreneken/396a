    "critic_reviews": [
        "Yoga Hosers is the best film Kevin Smith has made in a long time, which admittedly isn\u2019t saying much. But this new cult comedy-thriller may well represent a turning point for the writer-director.",
        "Yoga Hosers isn\u2019t a bad time at the movies, but it\u2019s painful when the gags fall flat.",
        "Yoga Hosers is a movie that feels like it was more fun to make than to watch.",
        "Yoga Hosers is tiring, and not because it's dumb or inherently obnoxious. No, as RogerEbert.com's resident Kevin Smith apologist, it pains me to say this, but: this movie should have been made by someone with more discipline.",
        "While Yoga Hosers continues Smith\u2019s quest to push himself into increasingly strange and uncomfortable directions as a filmmaker, it\u2019s either too derivative or too malformed to work the vast majority of the time.",
        "Kevin Smith's Yoga Hosers is a flabby, goofy, comically inert cartoon.",
        "Some of Mr. Smith\u2019s prior work made me laugh so hard that I cried; Yoga Hosers made me want to cry for different reasons.",
        "There\u2019s enough weirdness for Yoga Hosers to possibly generate some stoner cult appeal, but it\u2019s shoddily slapped together, with a clearly first-draft script, terrible editing (by Smith the elder) and continuity errors.",
        "Even fans who've stuck with Smith for two decades may draw the line at this outing, which offers ingredients just as inexplicable as those in Tusk (it's a sort of spinoff of that film) without the captivating weirdness that sometimes brought that midnighter to life.",
        "Trouble is, Yoga Hosers isn\u2019t really a movie. It\u2019s a quarter-to-1:00 a.m. SNL sketch, nightmarishly distended into oblivion. It\u2019s a corny Canuck joke, told for 88 surreally unfunny minutes. It has a target demographic of one: He wears hockey jerseys and, again, loves his daughter.",
        "Any of the film's attempts at moralizing are subsumed by Kevin Smith\u2019s obsession with taking aim at his critics.",
        "Yoga Hosers is lazy, unfunny, and self-indulgent.",
        "[A] lazy affair that aims for inspired lunacy but misses the mark by a mile.",
        "If it\u2019s true, as Kevin Smith noted in his lengthy introductory remarks at Sundance, that \u201cfailure is just success training,\u201d then he should be in the best shape of his career after Yoga Hosers, an imbecilic, strenuously wacky helping of see-what-sticks juvenilia.",
        "Unless you\u2019re Kevin Smith, don\u2019t expect Yoga Hosers to be funny or clever or well directed. It isn\u2019t for you.",
        "Mr. Garman\u2019s showcase has very little to do with anything else, but he\u2019s a pal of Mr. Smith\u2019s and, at the very least, his performance is a filet of wit amid a heaping helping of comedic byproduct.",
        "Instead of a film that\u2019s gleefully outlandish (see: \u201cSausage Party\u201d), Yoga Hosers is a drag. It contains none of the vivacity of \u201cClerks,\u201d \u201cMallrats\u201d or \u201cChasing Amy,\u201d and plenty of references to those days of yesteryear. It\u2019s a cannibalization of all that we once loved about Smith and his movies."

That said I liked the movie more than I thought I would! It's something of a mashup of Clerks (because they're in a convenient store), Critters (cheesy monsters) and Bill & Ted (goofy teenagers living in their own pop culture bubble). The movie isn't meant for me, but I feel like I need to defend all of the **** reviews he's getting. It seems like most people's complaints center around the movie is un-relatable (It's make believe folks!) or the fact he puts his friend's in it, which is something people gripe about with Adam Sandler or any Judd Apatow picture. I'm not comparing Smith to either of those guys, but he's been upfront and earnest as can be about who this movie was intended for. Tween girls, not himself. He believes that once it bombs in theaters it will eventually find its intended audience. Until then, maybe we can douse the fires and put away the pitchforks. So here's a 10 big Kev.",

You can tell it was built from the ground up to be a dumb B-movie. It's evident that Smith and crew were having a lot of fun making it. Fortunately some of that fun makes it's way into the movie making things a little easier for audiences to swallow. One just has to come into it with expecting outlandish absurdity.Much like Tusk, the movie is kind of batcrap crazy. Only this time it's more in the realm of just plain stupid. It's a fun kind of stupid, but stupid nonetheless. The kind that's going to turn off a lot of people that don't have a stomach for over-the-top ridiculousness. The intentional silliness and refusal to take anything seriously is amusing. Smith fills the movie with clever one-liners and amusing scenarios that poke fun at this technology obsessed generation. The ranting of an old man? Perhaps. Luckily the two leads are given some sharp dialog to combat it and provide the audience with some chuckles.Eventually though all this goofiness and oddball imagination reaches a point where it all beings to feel like too much. That's when the \"Bratzis\" (bratwurst Nazis) finally show up. We an amusing first conflict and then the plot deepens, we meet the main villain, and we start wishing things would wrap up already. Mercifully it does, but not before that eccentric sense of humor and absurdity that started as the movies strange sense of charm and strength in spite of it's flaws starts to get on our nerves. Then there's the stuff where Smith just takes shots at his critics.After Tusk I was expecting something weird, funny, and maybe even moronic. Turns out that's exactly what I got and I found myself suitably amused throughout the majority of it's runtime. It lacks Tusk's charm and quality (a big red flag should be going up if you didn't like that movie), but altogether it can prove amusing if you're just looking for some cheap laughs and something different to watch with your brain turned off. If B-movie horror-comedies aren't your thing then don't bother checking this one out. It's the kind of movie you watch for the silly jokes and just to see what kind of bizarre crap happens onscreen. It does go to moronic at times, but it's not a total waste of time if you know what to expect. And let's be honest, the plot description should give you a pretty darn good idea of what that is.6.2/10",
