    "critic_reviews": [
        "Both grimly naturalistic and infused with classical values at their most thoughtfully composed, Land of Mine is epic but deeply intimate; elegant but tough.",
        "It\u2019s a harrowing, sensitively realized study of cruelty, revenge and post-war retribution that ranks high among films about the cost of war and its continuing damage to humanity.",
        "Land of Mine is a powerful epic, superbly acted, tense and unsettling, but also poignant and occasionally tender.",
        "The masterful Land of Mine slowly, almost without notice, transforms into one of the most viscerally intense anti-war films since Dalton Trumbo\u2019s \"Johnny Got His Gun.\"",
        "Zandvliet is a relatively young and inexperienced director, but his spare use of music and widescreen images is assured and even inspired.",
        "It\u2019s clear from the way writer-director Martin Zandvliet sets up the story that the fiery Rasmussen, who denies the boys adequate rations and pens them indoors at night, will eventually soften. It\u2019s to the film\u2019s credit that he does so in ways that are eminently believable.",
        "The characters are so well drawn (and the relatively young cast steps up to the plate) that combined with the material\u2019s natural tension you\u2019ll find yourself riveted to the proceedings.",
        "Land of Mine serves as a poignant reminder that revenge destroys more than it satisfies and that compassion aids the healing process.",
        "So, yes, Land of Mine is a World War II movie -- but it's not likely a World War II movie you've seen before.",
        "This isn\u2019t a war movie; it\u2019s an after-the-war movie. But the battle lines are still drawn, and every ragged breath the film takes braces for an explosion.",
        "An act of expiation, Land of Mine is honorable, harrowing and stirring.",
        "Again and again, its stark and suspenseful compositions strike the eye \u2014 figures in dark clothing, prone on a pale beach, with lines of wire, black warning flags, and the chill gray waves beyond.",
        "Crisply and efficiently put together by writer-director Zandvliet, Land of Mine has the inherent edge-of-your-seat concern about what kind of damage the bombs will inflict on which of these boys, but it is the psychological qualities of the situation that hold the greatest interest.",
        "The film works as a moving anti-war essay and as a gripping thriller.",
        "Zandvliet\u2019s script and direction avoid milking an innately loaded situation for excess melodrama or pathos, sticking to a discreet economy of approach that accumulates considerable power.",
        "Writer-director Zandvliet has crafted a handsome, affecting and questioning film about post-war revenge and forgiveness. On a tough field to navigate, he makes it to the other side, commendably.",
        "The German boys are very well cast, with young actors Louis Hofmann and Joel Basman especially giving the kind of striking performances that should lead to other films.",
        "The cheesiest thing about it is the punny English-language title with which it\u2019s been saddled. Otherwise, Land Of Mine is tough and admirably grim, turning a harrowing history lesson into a study in how the battles of wartime don\u2019t always cease with the ceasefire.",
        "Mr. Zandvliet is less interested in the stark battle between good and evil than in the shifting ground of power and responsibility, and the way that every person carries the potential for decency and depravity.",
        "Despite the sense of fatalism and some clumsy turns in Zandvliet\u2019s script, Land Of Mine achieves moments of chilling suspense.",
        "The humanity of the performances and pathos of the tale shine through the tropes and cliches to make this smart movie with the dumb-pun for a title a worthy enterprise and well worth your time.",
        "One appreciates the desire of the filmmaker to let the audience fill in the back story, but Rasmussen\u2019s behavior reflects badly on the Danish and heightens sympathy for the POWs.",
        "A fascinating topic is attenuated by conservative storytelling and sketchy characterisation. Nevertheless, the sense of place is as assured as the vigilant performances, while the defusing sequences are genuinely suspenseful.",
        "The film is sometimes too sentimental, too predictable in its drift, but electric in individual moments.",
        "Land of Mine's fitful jolts of suspense can't compensate for the story's wholly familiar trajectory.",
        "Land of Mine is essentially bomb porn."

Remember this title for another six month, because I am confident this film will make a journey to theTeen POWs in the post WWII Denmark.A Danish war-drama that was inspired by the historical account, but all the characters were fictional. Remember this title for another six month, because I am confident this film will make a journey to the west coast of the USA to compete at the 89th Academy Awards in the coming February. I have seen many foreign films, but I'm not this much positive for any others. If this film fails to make, then that would be a great disappointment despite having no idea of what are the other four films. So this is just for now, my stance may change later.Anyway, the film was heartbreakingly amazing. The WWII stories I had seen those told from the perspectives of the Australian, Japanese, Korean, Russian to African and European to the American western sea, Hawaii. And this is a Danish story, sets in just after the end of the war where prisoners of the war were used to clean up the mess. In the opening the teen German POWs were trained to defuse the land mine explosives and then later the unit was handed over to the Danish sergeant Carl Rasmussen where they are all going to work in one of the west coast landmines that was used to defend the Scandinavia by the Nazi. That is the story told how it all ends in the remaining parts.This was like another 'Kajaki', but not actually a war film. Using of the prisoners as the labourers is a violation, according to the Geneva rule. That's the point of the film, focused to reveal the inhume act. But it was not anything like 'The Railway Man' 'Unbroken' or the 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'. Watching a film about the brave soldiers inspires us and bring patriotism, but in this those teen kid screaming whenever something goes wrong really brings heartache. So not everybody feels comfortable with it, especially the family audience. But there were lots of edgy moments and you would never know what events follows.\"If they are old enough to go to war, they are old enough to clean up.\"It was shot is the real location, and I think that part contributed to depicting the actual atmosphere where most of the POWs lost their arms and legs and some exploded into many pieces in the air. It was a simple narration, but the visuals talked itself more than anything else. All the actors were outstanding, especially those 4-5 German teens and of course the Danish sergeant Carl. I think the Carl's influence had more impact, after seeing the opening scene where he went outrage and beat up those German soldiers returning home.There are a couple of small twists, but there are some scenes which are not easy to get over. Even though we know those were just fake, but that does not work once you totally into the story deeply. This is a different kind of emotional film, something you rarely experience. The director who is also the writer must be appreciated for handling it perfectly. Especially keeping the screenplay uncomplicated and between the two nations, where in the real event involves the British officials. I have never seen his other films, but this one will define him forth and the people are going to recognise him. So I hope he'll keep up doing such level films in the future.I have never seen such film, I mean seen some where the kids were tortured, but this was very unique and totally a different perspective for that takes place in the backdrop of the WWII. Especially the Germans perspective is the very rare kind. So I'm kind of thinking if Germany picks 'Look Who's Back' for the Oscars, the contest between these two would bring two different moods. At this point I don't remember any Danish film I have seen so far in my life other than this one which I feel is the best Danish film ever. I mean, come on, who would do such film where your own nation, if not the whole nation, the one who represent was shown in the negative shade over the Nazi Germans. This is definitely one of the best films of the year. Highly recommended.8/10",
