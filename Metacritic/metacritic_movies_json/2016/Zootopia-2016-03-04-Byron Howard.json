  "summary": "The modern mammal metropolis of Zootopia is a city like no other.

But whenThe modern mammal metropolis of Zootopia is a city like no other. Comprised of habitat neighborhoods like ritzy Sahara Square and frigid Tundratown, it’s a melting pot where animals from every environment live together—a place where no matter what you are, from the biggest elephant to the smallest shrew, you can be anything. But when optimistic Officer Judy Hopps arrives, she discovers that being the first bunny on a police force of big, tough animals isn’t so easy. Determined to prove herself, she jumps at the opportunity to crack a case, even if it means partnering with a fast-talking, scam-artist fox, Nick Wilde, to solve the mystery.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "The year’s best film so far.",
    "Zootopia delights, in ways big and small.",
    "Zootopia is brimming with silly, slapstick humor and terrific one-liners — and yes, some simple yet valuable lessons about tolerance and prejudice and learning to embrace our differences. There’s nothing wrong with a lesson or two when those lessons are packaged within such a great and memorable film.",
    "As crazy as the design of the world is, Zootopia ends up feeling like a genuine place. There's a vibrancy to it that runs through everything from the pace of the storytelling to the background details of the world in which the story takes place.",
    "There are enough under-the-radar subtleties, rendered with a refreshing lack of smart-aleckiness, to make Zootopia feel current and fresh. It’s a modest, unassuming entertainment that’s motored by a sly sensibility.",
    "Bursting with a rich blend of timely themes, superb voice work, wonderful visuals and laugh-out-loud wit, Walt Disney Animation Studios' Zootopia is quite simply a great time at the movies.",
    "Funny, smart, thought-provoking — and musical, too.",
    "Boasting a pitch perfect voice cast led by a terrific Ginnifer Goodwin as a righteous rural rabbit who becomes the first cotton-tailed police recruit in the mammal-centric city of Zootopia, the 3D caper expertly combines keen wit with a gentle, and very timely, message of inclusivity and empowerment.",
    "Zootopia is visually rich, with a fully realized cityscape and an action-filled train station during commuter rush that would take several viewings to fully appreciate. It’s emotionally rich, too, a film that promises to have staying power far beyond spring break.",
    "A tour through the byways of Zootopia is a bracing blend of color and richly detailed design.",
    "The genius of Zootopia is that it works on two levels: It’s a timely and clever examination of the prejudices endemic to society, and also an entertaining, funny adventure about furry creatures engaged in solving a mystery.",
    "It’s almost certain to be the most existentially probing talking animal cartoon of the year.",
    "Zootropolis is a witty, creative and entertaining romp with literally endless sequel potential and the biggest collection of four-legged critters this side of Noah.",
    "Zootropolis is a real delight - an entertaining and endlessly inventive comedy and something with more insight than anyone could have anticipated.",
    "It remains entertaining throughout — a testament to the inventiveness of the on-screen action. And Pixar’s influence.",
    "Zootopia, like its heroine, is zesty, bright, and breakneck, with chase scenes and well-tuned gags where you half expect songs to be.",
    "What it lacks in thematic innovation it more than makes up for with enough memorable characters and visual splendor to make Zootopia a perennial Disney favorite.",
    "Zootopia is so well done I forgot it was animated.",
    "The world that Zootropolis creates is intelligent and fascinatingly detailed – it feels more like a movie by Disney-owned Pixar than a straight Disney film.",
    "Easily one of Disney’s more imaginative and detail-oriented CGI offerings in a while, Zootopia uses the classic tropes of anthropomorphized animals and comic references to pop-culture touchstones to slyly puzzle out what it means to be “civilized.”",
    "There’s a lot here for kids to like and nearly as much to keep parents from fidgeting.",
    "If Zootopia were a bit vaguer, or perhaps dumber and less pleased with itself, it might have been a classic, albeit of a very different, less reputable sort. As-is, it's a goodhearted, handsomely executed film that doesn't add up in the way it wants to.",
    "Ultimately, all audiences can find something to enjoy in Zootopia, though adults may find more to sink their teeth into, which is always refreshing.",
    "There’s a depth to the city that shows how far the form has come in a short time, and Zootopia is better off for it, especially when it still ultimately doesn’t break away from the familiar Disney formula as much as some of the studio’s other recent films have managed.",
    "Apart from its anthropomorphic, allegorical angle, Zootopia is also a tale of female empowerment and a classic noir, too.",
    "Its colorful residents make Zootopia a wondrous place to visit for two hours until you have to go back to real life, where Shakira isn’t a gazelle and law enforcement is a lot less furry.",
    "Throughout Zootopia, each bustling frame is packed with so much repeated-viewings-rewarded imagery that the screen must be sampled rather than taken in as a whole.",
    "Like Disney’s \"Big Hero 6,\" the movie is busy, but not breathless with invention.",
    "The film goes deeper in its allegorizing, tapping into the volatile nature of identity politics.",
    "Zootopia delivers the genre’s requisite barrage of quick-hit puns and pop culture riffs.",
    "Zootopia proves a successful amalgamation of disparate influences, much like its eponymous city.",
    "The movie’s message about tolerance and not pre-judging others sings, and the many chases, interrogations (a weasel ably voiced by Alan Tudyk) and narrow escapes pay off.",
    "Thankfully the creators of this expansive adventure, a crime-solving saga starring a bunny who wants to be a cop, have a bit more in mind than the usual strains of aww-dorable humor and frenetic action.",
    "What saves this big-budget cartoon behemoth is its modest, old-fashioned storytelling.",
    "The biggest strength of Zootopia is in how it acknowledges all identities are capable of carrying prejudice and wielding judgement, yet the first step toward change is awareness.",
    "Like the movie as a whole, she (Judy) is funny, sweet, sophisticated and adventurous.",
    "Though it never gets too preachy, the film delivers its message about the dangers of stereotyping quite clearly and draws parallels with instances of everyday racial prejudice among humans.",
    "It is, in short, a city that only the Mouse House could imagine, and one that lends itself surprisingly well to a classic L.A.-style detective story, a la “The Big Lebowski” or “Inherent Vice,” yielding an adult-friendly whodunit with a chipper “you can do it!” message for the cubs.",
    "Judy and Nick’s unlikely-buddies routine is amusing, but their exploits and interplay occasionally neglect the youngest demographic.",
    "It’s somewhat heavy material for a film aimed at children, but perhaps very necessary in an age where a beer-stained uncle might have ruined Thanksgiving wearing a Make America Great Again baseball cap.",
    "Heavy with pop allusions and references to other crime underworld movies, including The Godfather and Chinatown, Zootopia is impressive in its visual conception and scope: At once straightforward and densely layered with wit and incident, it manages a lively clip and the odd fresh joke.",
    "Good intentions don't always make for good movies. Case in point: Zootopia, a Disney film with more on its mind than animated fun and fuzzies. So much, in fact, that it loses track of what audiences expect, what they're being sold.",
    "Zootopia takes the cultural practice of posing animals as human characters to queasy new heights."

I was expecting a lot based on the really high rotten tomatoes score, at one point it was at 100%. It is really something you never seen before because it's an animated movie. However this movie is creative, dark, silly, fun, entertaining, touching, scary, and even surprising at times. The plot was very well constructed and it really does give a great message to everyone. It's also very creative at times and something's were mindblowing. However, I think the biggest win for the film is its humor. If you've seen the trailer, you'd probably know what I'm talking about. However, there's a lot more throughout the movie, espicially the ending. All the voices also fitted perfectly and the film was also very touching, and sad. I think this film should at least deserve an oscar nomination for best animated film. I really think this is one of the very best disney films out there and it is certainly the best animated film of the year. I even enjoyed this more than inside out!\r(Fingers crossed on Finding Dory). (100/100)",

Also, it's beautifully animated and the talented cast voices suit their characters perfectly. It has a plenty of funny scenes which we didn't watch before in any animated movie or even a live-action movie. This movie is like a comedy-adventure-action-crime movie and despite that it never made the viewers feel confused while watching it. The characters are definitely the most complicated characters I've ever seen in an animated movie, each character has its own point of view due to the experiences they get through and that makes each character has different motives and feelings.(10/10)",

I will not deny that Zootopia, the city, actually feels likeZootopia is fine. It's not a masterpiece, nor a terrible movie, it's not obnoxious and annoying like an Illumination movie by any means, but it's far from Disney's best work. I will not deny that Zootopia, the city, actually feels like another character. It is filled with creative concepts and ideas. The animation is great, as expected from Disney and the characters are filled with tons of personality thanks to creative character design. They aren't cute for the sake of being cute nor look like generic animal characters like some other animated movie with cute animals that came out the same year (CofcofSingcofcof) and the story actually takes advantage of the fact that they are animals. Also, this is a really funny movie. I always have a blast with this movie everytime I watch it, there are so many genuinely funny moments that I really enjoyed. Nick and Judy, the main characters, have a great dynamic, and are so fun to watch together. For the most part it is well written...For the most part, I said. My problems with this movie are with the script. The social commentary and the racism allegories are soooo on the nose and obvious, you might think that \"it's okay because it's a kids movie\", but I disagree, because there are kids movies with subtle social commentary and parallels to the real world, like Chicken Run, I mean it's not like they had a character explain to the audience that they are in a concentration camp or something, and that is how Zootopia feels. It gets so on the nose at one point that it becomes cheesy instead of shocking. I was also not a really big fan of some obvious furry pandering stuff, like the animal nudist club scene or the weirdly sensual dancing tigers at the dancing number at the end, those moments were awkward...Speaking about that, I hated the ending, it was so cringeworthy. It ended great but no...They needed a dance scene, because that is DEFINETLY not an animated kids movie cliché!Overall, I don't hate this movie. It's pretty good actually, but definetly not a great movie. I agree with people that say that it didn't deserve the Oscar, it should've gone to Moana, which is a far superior film in almost every aspect. Regardless, Zootopia is one of the better modern Disney films, I mean, at least it's better than Frozen, Big Hero 6 and Ralph Breaks the Internet",

It tackles a large number of social issues (racism, bullying, prejudice, sexism, inequality, stereotyping, etc.). Zootopia's world is inhabited by two main groups of mammals: predators and preys. The beautiful thing about this movie is that it depicts racism and prejudice in a very \"equal\" way: predators and preys do not correspond to any human race existing on this planet. The directors and the staff have been very sensitive and clever in my opinion for doing that. It gives the movie a sense of universality. This movie is plenty of details, references, puns, etc. It is definitely very funny, entertaining and the computer graphics are just stunning. The movie also has sad/emotional scenes and that makes you feel empathy towards the main characters, Judy and Nick (who are simply AMAZING), but they also help create a bond between them. The message at the end of this film also had a huge impact on me. It may sound cliché but it is definitely beautiful and praiseworthy. One last thing, I highly highly highly recommend this movie to both kids and (especially) adults (but also teenagers XD)!",

Times in theaters was that the movie wasn't just trying to be a family movie but a family movie that children and adults could enjoy all round, while trying to make a impact on you with displaying some modern issues with the modern world, and after the research i found just how hard it was to make and create a story out of ideas the people at Disney who worked so hard to create a master piece with actual characters i could care about, a story which is thrilling to watch, and a expanisve world that feels like you could immerse yourself in imagining the possibilities, and  has some much potential for more, compared to another world like for example Frozen: Once the story was over and you start to think about it there not very much left in the world that they could 'go' from, While Zootopia on the other hand has so much left in the world where, heck they could literally make a TV series, or possibly another movie, (which fans of the movie would Love), and the possibilities of the World of Zootopia just continues, if the main protagonist get boring (Nick And Judy, which i highly doubt, just go look at he fan-fic archive that place is booming) then they could switch the protagonist , So the possibilities are just endless, so in the end, I loved the movie, so much i decided to take 35-40 minutes of my life (slow type even though i'm on he computer like 5 times week for like three-five hours, weird) that I'll never get back to write a review just to rate, show how i care about the movie, and further more just recommend, if you haven't seen this, I ask you to go and watch this, and if you don't just leave midway of the movie, word of advice, if you leave during the movie but not near the end most theaters will give you your money back or a free movie pass, how i know....*Cough, Dawn Of Justice. But i highly doubt you will dislike this movie and if you did watch this, well...Go watch it again. Plus I ship them *whispers if you know what i mean, even the Directors and actors are in it ;D",

The powerful and eloquent message delivered through the use of anthropomorphic animals is something quite unique that Disney has accomplished in this movie. The funny delivery on jokes and parodies on established clichés empower the movie's delight. The stunning visuals, the on point voice acting, and the amusing plot are simply cherries on top. Although the film is fairly straight forward, given its a Disney movie targeted towards a very wide audience, the simplicity won't take away from the wonder that the entirety of film brings.

Beautiful visuals, a fantastic cast, and a modern tale about prejudice all combine into what has become my favorite Disney film of the past 14 years.  There are hidden gems of adult humor, references to popular entertainment, and current events throughout.  It's a film that's as much for adults as it is kids, and will appeal to a very wide audience.\r The plot is a story we've heard before, but told supremely well.  It hits very close to home for anyone who's been a victim of prejudice, and serves as a powerful reminder that even if you think you aren't prejudiced, you still might be.  Yet despite the film's serious \"message\" it's not delivered in a ham-handed or overbearing way.  It's interwoven into a story about acknowledging your limitations, and trying to overcome them anyway, despite what others might say.\r My only complaint is actually a hidden compliment:\rThe world of Zootopia and its characters is so unbelievably well-constructed and vibrant that we can't help but want more of it.  The movie's short runtime doesn't allow the deep exploration of the side characters and environments that I desperately crave after seeing it.  There's a massive amount of sub-plots and tantalizing details we don't get a chance to delve into, which makes me a bit sad.  However, the polished end result is so fantastic that I can hardly use it as a true \"negative\".\r Hands-down, this is Disney's best animated film since \"Lilo and Stitch\" and deserves high praise.

This is a movie that works for everyone. It doesn't matter if you're 4 years old or 40 years old.\r I love the characters. They did such a great job of building up Judy Hopps from the moment she comes on screen so we love her almost immediately. I think she is going to go down and I think I will remember her as one of my favorite Disney characters. One thing that Disney has done so well with their animated films is casting. They don't ever feel like they needs to stuff their animated films to the brim with big name voices in order to be successful they just hunt for the voices who fit their characters. Ginnifer Goodwin (who I never even heard of before this movie) made such a great voice for Judy Hopps and I can say with confidence that Jason Bateman was the perfect choice for Nick Wilde.\r Disney just aced the animation. It is so beautiful and I watched this film with a friend in a theater packed with children and their parents and I think my friend and I had the most fun during the screening.

All of the hype for 2016 was for Moana and Pixar's Finding Dory. However, the trailers looked promising and Disney is known for talking animal movies; from the decently good Robin Hood to the rather poor Chicken Little. Then the first critic reviews came in, saying this was a masterpiece and the best Disney film since The Lion King. So I went into the theater with high hopes and wasn't disappointed at all. In fact, Zootopia is the best Disney animated film in 20+ years and stands tall with the greatest of great Disney classics. Why is this? The story, animation, and characters rock!\r Starting with the animation, it is extremely detailed and simply beautiful. The city is a mix of old and new structures and through clever ways, is able to accommodate mammals from the smallest mouse to the tallest giraffe. All the animal characters are expertly designed and are lovable to the point where you wish you could hug their fur. Unlike other anthropomorphic animal movies where the animals were basically humans with fur on top, the animals here are a perfect blend with both human and natural characteristics. Like humans, these characters wear cloths (except shoes), walk upright, and live very human lives. Like real animals, these mammals are their respective sizes, live in their respective climates, and keep some of their natural looks/ characteristics. Both of the main characters; Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde; are quite memorable, imperfect, and complex. Even the side characters, such as Police Chief Bogo, Officer Clawhauser, and Flash all play an important part to the story and are lovable themselves.\r Speaking of the story; that was the most shocking part of the film. What starts out as a simple buddy cop detective story turns into a complex, Pixar- esque commentary on stereotyping, race relations, fear mongering, the media, drugs, social privilege, point of view, relationships, and bigotry. Like modern day America, this society has cultural issues that are kept under the rug until exposed. When exposed, all hell breaks loose and the city must learn how to come together and resolve their species (racial) issues. This message isn't new, but the fact that Disney took it on in full force shows the risk they took. The story and theme are presented in a non- preachy manner, stays neutral, and is rather realistic. Instead of the message being \"stop stereotyping now\", it is \"let's acknowledge there is problem and work towards a solution\". It is very realistic to the way we think and doesn't present a clear solution, leaving that to the audience to think for themselves. Not to mention the excellent comedy that's woven in to keep the tone perfectly balanced between its laugh- out- loud moments and more serious themes. It is simply inspiring.\r Sadly Zootopia, like its titular city, isn't a perfect movie. The pacing is uneven in areas as the jokes go by too quickly and the more dramatic moments too slowly. Do to some pop culture elements, it isn't as timeless as other Disney/ Pixar movies. In addition, the anti- stereotyping message is a little muddled as some of the animal stereotypes are true. (sloths are slow,etc.) Overall, the 55th Disney animated film in 79 years is a near- masterpiece with an uplifting important story about prejudice, lovable characters, and top- notch animation.",

A great plot with some interesting twists, fantastic animation, and a very interesting setting. The only reason this isn't getting a 10 is because the message, though positive, is a bit too on the nose. The message itself is fine but while watching, you will feel like it's coming across as more of a lesson geared towards people involved and paying attention to the U.S.'s current situation.However, the alternative message of fulfilling your dreams and perseverance is definitely more appealing. Call me insane, but I honestly think this is better than Frozen. Frozen was a fine film but it may have been a bit too overrated on its debut.

SoTHIS REVIEW IS SPOILER-FREE!!!! (Or at least for the movie, there is a spoiler for Marley and me :))\rMy favorite movie of all time is the Lion King, which led me to love the animal and watching the film hundreds (yes, HUNDREDS) of times. So when i heard that THIS movie was BETTER than the Lion King, I laughed. However, once I watched it, my mind was blown. Zootopia is a movie about a bunny who wants to become a cop, but no bunny has ever been a cop before. All of a sudden, 14 animals go missing, but she is not assigned to them. However, later in the movie, she is assigned to find one of the animals. This movie has a bit of Eddie the Eagle added into it, with the \"Never give up\" part being easily seen there. The voice acting is extremely good and believable in every way. The visuals are beautiful, being one of the best graphic animation films I have ever seen. The humor is spot on, especially the ending. Some parts in the movie are predictable, but some times, I was shocked at what was happening. Overall, I have changed my mind. For over 12 years, the Lion King was my favorite movie, but now, Zootopia takes that spot. Also, there were some moments that nearly made me cry, and this is coming from a person who did not even care about the dog dying in Marley and Me. I would recommend this movie 100%.",

But surprisingly and thought-provokingly, it became of one of Disney's best films since The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast. This is a fine example of how Disney Animation can prove to the public that they are the greatest animation studio of all time, even beating out Pixar by their own standards. With low points of Home on the Range and Chicken Little, to 11 years later, all the way back to the top of their game with this, all thanks to its clever story, perfect writing, a perfect balance of humour and drama, a lot of intense, heartwarming, touching and memorable moments, best character moments, a strong bond, chemistry and connection between Judy and Nick, great musical score, excellent animation, a large cast of three-dimensional characters and a powerful anti-racism message of prejudice and discrimination. It's not just one of Disney's best works, it's also one of their smarter and more mature films. If you enjoyed anthropomorphic animal films like Robin Hood, you would love this movie even more. This is a must-watch for the whole family. It is a perfect family film. I gave it a perfect 10 out of 10.",

Zootopia ignores the institutional and structural ways in which racism is perpetuated in modern areas, instead presenting a sort of whitewashed 80s-era \"we stopped hating people of color\" mindset. As Zootopia is marketed as a family movie, it's masterful production quality is largely dwarfed by its perpetuation of a destructive erasure of structural racism.",

For kids the message is about never giving up on your dreams and not letting others bring you down. For adults it's a powerful allegory for the evils of racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination.\r It's a really deep film. However, pushing past it's compelling themes it's also a very funny and charming movie. The animation is stunning and the voice cast is excellent. Presentation wise it knocks everything out of the park. It's also very sharp with it's writing as well. It's humor is on point and very clever. It's able to bring jokes any kid could laugh at and even squeeze in some more mature ones for the older audiences in ways the younglings won't pick up on.\r The plot does hit some very familiar beats with it's story about a rookie cop with something to prove out to solve a tough case. There are twists here we've seen time and time again over the years. The sense of humor, heart, deep subject matter, and imaginative world do allow the movie to overcome it's plot familiarity. However the issue is still noticeable.\r It ends up being very minor though. In the face of everything Zootopia does right, this stumble feels practically miniscule. It's another Disney movie with plenty to offer the entire family. It's a sweet, touching, and very mature tale that's most importantly funny. It's an all around success and a movie I have no trouble highly recommending to any and everybody.\r 9.3/10",
