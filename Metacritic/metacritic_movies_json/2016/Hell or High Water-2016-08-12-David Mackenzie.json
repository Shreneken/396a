  "summary": "Two brothers—Toby (Chris Pine), a straight-living, divorced father trying to make a better life for his son; and Tanner (Ben Foster), a short-tempered ex-con with a loose trigger finger—come together to rob branch after branch of the bank that is foreclosing on their family land.

The hold-ups are part of a last-ditch scheme to take back a future that powerful forces beyond their control have stolen from under their feet. Vengeance seems to be theirs until they find themselves in the crosshairs of a relentless, foul-mouthed Texas Ranger (Jeff Bridges) looking for one last triumph on the eve of his retirement. As the brothers plot a final bank heist to complete their plan, a showdown looms at the crossroads where the last honest law man and a pair of brothers with nothing to live for except family collide. … Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "And Bridges? What's there to say about a man who makes it look so easy, and who - in one breathless, pivotal scene - runs through a range of emotion like a wild pony running across the land. Genius, any way you look at it.",
    "By turns funny, elegiac and thrilling, it’s a tale of brotherhood and family that takes in the harsh beauty of the land, the elusive nature of right and wrong and the quirky delights of human connections in a time of bewildering change.",
    "The year’s most exhilarating film.",
    "Hell or High Water is a terrific piece of entertainment.... It isn't a highbrow indie but a gritty work of art. Mackenzie's movie thrills for all the right reasons and will be fondly remembered at year's end.",
    "Furnished with faces as beaten as the vehicles the brothers drive and discard, Hell or High Water is a chase movie disguised as a western. Its humor is as dry as prairie dust...and its morals are steadfastly gray.",
    "What Mackenzie has crafted here is a crowd-pleaser with undeniable art-house elements.",
    "This is the kind of Western in which we know there will be blood but pray there won’t be, because the violence is bound to be gratuitous, absurd, with a needless finality. Hell or High Water is a rare humanist Western: Finality is the true villain.",
    "Hell or High Water isn’t a flashy movie, but it has an undeniably resonant sense of small-scale justice, not to mention an authentic sense of place that will remind you of other Texas-set masterpieces like John Sayles’ \"Lone Star\" and the Coen brothers’ \"No Country for Old Men.\" See it, and then spread the word.",
    "With electrifying, graceful direction by David Mackenzie...a rich, darkly humorous and deeply insightful screenplay by Taylor Sheridan...and no fewer than four performances as good as anything I’ve seen onscreen this year, Hell or High Water is an instant classic modern-day Western, traveling down familiar roads but always, always with a fresh and original spin.",
    "Foster was born to this kind of role, rugged but soulful, and he’s outstanding. The surprise is Pine, giving by far his best performance.",
    "Hell or High Water is a thrillingly good movie — a crackerjack drama of crime, fear, and brotherly love set in a sun-roasted, deceptively sleepy West Texas that feels completely exotic for being so authentic.",
    "A lean, efficient modern Western that is so satisfyingly constructed I’m tempted to say it’s just about perfect. There’s a special pleasure in watching a movie that knows exactly what it’s after and then, in scene after scene, gets it.",
    "Hell Or High Water is the kind of movie that makes you fall in love again with the lost art of dialogue, getting you hooked anew on the snap of flavorful conversation.",
    "Pulpy, old-fashioned Western action and terrific performances make Hell or High Water one of the most satisfying releases of the summer.",
    "Bridges knows just what he’s doing, and with the splendid West Texas waltz of a drama, Hell or High Water, British director David Mackenzie has given him the perfect hook on which to hang his hat.",
    "Hell or High Water is that rare offering that both feels old-fashioned in its action-thriller gratification and in-the-moment about everything else.",
    "That Hell or High Water makes you empathize with and understand (though not excuse) each member of this disparate quartet is a tribute to the way Taylor Sheridan’s screenplay works equally well as a thriller, character study and pointed social commentary.",
    "When the movie just sits with the characters on front porches or in backyards, Mackenzie's generous, hands-off approach with his actors — most of the conversation scenes play out in long takes with minimal camera movement — yields poignant rewards.",
    "From a purely narrative perspective, there’s nothing new here but like a new arrangement of a familiar tune, the slight changes make it fresh and enjoyable.",
    "Scenic, well-paced and rich in dialogue and character, the film is Coen brothers for the squares, and maybe the best middle-of-the-seat drama of the summer.",
    "It’s ABOUT something, which has become a rarity in Hollywood pictures. Sometimes, the smallest stories cast the largest shadows.",
    "For all the methodical pacing and old archetypes, Hell or High Water is a thoroughly contemporary action film, complete with fast chases and flashes of dark comedy. But like the classic Westerns, it invites viewers to evaluate, one more time, the myth of the American outlaw, and the idea of criminals as heroes.",
    "Chris Pine proves he can act. Ben Foster, well, he always could. And Jeff Bridges shows them both how it's done. Those are just three riveting reasons to pony up for Hell or High Water.",
    "In a word, Hell or High Water is terrific.",
    "The dialogue is terse and funny while hinting at much larger matters, such as the way poverty can be handed from generation to generation like a bad gene or a disease.",
    "What the movie has, above all, is a dramatic line, clean and straight. In its faces, its scenery and its plain satisfactions it makes us feel like we've been somewhere, when we get to the end of that line.",
    "In this bleak West Texas landscape where everyone seems to be struggling, you find yourself rooting, inexplicably, for all of them against a clear villain: the faceless, predatory bank.",
    "A terrific heist picture.",
    "A rich, complex drama that’s as much about consequence and justification as it is destiny.",
    "Grounded in lively performances by Chris Pine and Ben Foster as a pair of bank-robbing brothers, with a capable assist from a no-nonsense Jeff Bridges as the sheriff on their tail, Hell or High Water tries nothing new but delivers a fun ride.",
    "Mackenzie goes western in satisfying style, while Bridges, Pine and Foster bring true grit to Sheridan’s tight script.",
    "Taut, tense and burnished by Jeff Bridges at his best. This is a deceptively simple tale of Texan cops and robbers that drags the Old West into the modern age.",
    "The surprise standout is Chris Pine. Maybe because he possesses unfairly good looks and outrageous charisma, Pine hasn’t received much recognition as an actor. He is outstanding in Hell or High Water.",
    "The terrific Hell or High Water is like a gritty new retelling of the Frank and Jesse James story — only with getaway cars instead of horses, and assault rifles replacing six-shooters.",
    "As much as all four men are familiar types, the director, writer and actors imbue them with humanity, steering their arcs through tense action — including a nice throwback Western shootout on rocky terrain — to a quietly moving conclusion.",
    "The film’s ace card is its intertwining of not one but two mismatched buddy relationships.",
    "Despite treading some familiar territory, British director David Mackenzie's new film Hell or High Water proves itself a brilliantly executed, sharply written genre gem.",
    "It’s an action-thriller with punch; Bridges gives the characterisation ballast and heft and Pine and Foster bring a new, grizzled maturity to their performances.",
    "It has a straight-down-the-highway momentum, interesting stakes, and more textured character work than you can shake a stick at.",
    "Hell or High Water is a good but not great movie with sensational lead performances that elevate it to enjoyably memorable status.",
    "A desperado drama wrapped around a Bernie Sanders campaign speech, Hell or High Water overcomes its vapid political leanings with loads of West Texas atmosphere, smart dialogue and acutely observed relationships.",
    "This solid genre pic salutes its touchstones.",
    "David McKenzie’s Hell or High Water is a gritty, darkly humorous, and fiendishly violent neo-western.",
    "Hell or High Water might walk over familiar ground with second-hand boots in terms of character development and structural beats, but it does so with great personality and zero pretension of wanting to be anything more.",
    "While moviegoers desperate to see anything that doesn’t involve a superhero may be willing to overlook its shortcomings, others will undoubtedly be disappointed to find that it's somewhat less than the sum of its parts.",
    "As with Sicario, the broad strokes of the film's Southwestern stereotypes gradually sharpen into focus as the story pivots to a look at the systemic forces that shape the characters.",
    "A film with a fistful of memorable moments—most of them involving Bridges hurling insults at people—but not a great deal new to say."

Ben Foster always brings it, but he delivers a level of nuance I was even surprised by. Chris Pine finally gets a chance to demonstrate his real acting chops - he's been wasting his time in too many Star Trek flicks.  And The Dude?  Jeff Bridges?  This might be his career-defining performance. Beyond the bravura acting performances, the film just has an easy, authentic feel to it. You can almost smell West Texas. It's a beautifully shot work. Won't spoil the plot - just go see this film. It's the antidote to what's been ailing Hollywood for the last couple of years. If this sucker doesn't deliver at least 2 statues in late February 2017, I'll be disappointed. (But what else is new?)",

Hell or High Water is a movie that is almost completely dependent on the cast andHELL OR HIGH WATER\r Its been a while since a movie like this came out.  A movie that is so simple in its execution, yet so layered and tense at the same time. Hell or High Water is a movie that is almost completely dependent on the cast and the chemistry between them. This movie has a cast of four living characters and two characters that are as important, even though they have no lines in the movie.\r On the surface, it seems like a simple heist/hunt movie, but the movie is actually a study of friendship, brotherhood, neighbors, and the city and state coming together. Movie is set in two states, states of Texas and Oklahoma. Both of those states were portrayed so perfectly in the movie, that they became a fifth character. The ambient in the movie is so well portrayed that one could simply get lost in the beauty of the two states by itself. Music and the support cast, that lives in this environment, are as important as the main cast, to if you haven't noticed I haven't gotten to yet. Reason for that was, I wanted to explain, that everything in this movie is so interconnected, it is so difficult to focus on the just main characters.\r Now that I have set the premise for this review lets talk about the main driving force of this picture.\r THE CAST\r The main cast of this movie entails of  : Jeff Bridges,  Gil Birmingham as the Texas Rangers and Chris Pine and Ben Foster as the bank robbers. The main thing to say in this review is to say, it is really hard to establish exactly who stole the show in this movie. The entire cast had such fantastic chemistry on the screen.\r Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham's scenes portray that these are the people that knew each other seemingly their entire lives. The friendly jabs toward each other, they way they deal with situations, everything is portrayed so smooth, you forget these are the actors, especially since they truly show you how different their characters are, and how they would  approach certain things. It is still early talk about Oscar Nominations, but everyone in this movie at least deserves up most consideration, especially Jeff Bridges.\r On the other hand we have the brothers.\r Ben Foster and Chris Pine. Without spoiling any of the movie, but just to establish my point here, the movie right away focuses on these characters, and their chemistry, their reasoning and their genuine love for each other. For any doubters out there that Chris Pine cannot act, those fears are completely unfounded here, as I would say he brings the possibly career changing role in this movie. Ben Foster is equally brilliant in the role, and as I have mentioned and I keep bringing this point home, as it is well deserved, the movie ultimately works because of the chemistry between the characters.\r This type of movie, its an experience, it is not everyone's cup of tea, its not super action packed with ongoing explosions, no superheroes or tornadoes or aliens, or natural disasters. It's a classic movie, that I mentioned before they don't make anymore. Actually, I should rephrase that, that mainstream studios don't make anymore.  And I am going to do something that's going to pull some hate, but this movie I would declare BONNIE AND CLYDE for the 21st century. It is just that good.\r 4 out of 4 stars.",

Feels like a modern western kind, because of where this story takes place, I mean Texas. There's no digital world like phones, computers et cetera, just an old fashioned storytelling. This is the story of two brothers and their series of bank robbery job. They are doing it for a reason, but on the other end, two cops make their effort to find who they are and nab them red handed. So when they meet, that's where the story gets to its end part.It has a strong opening, then slows down. Actually, it was approached like a classic crime film, which mean no high-tech. The story was a one liner, but the events in that story were extended. A simple screenplay, yet very effective presented on the screen. Of course the story ends with this film, but feels like there's more. It is very unlikely, though I'm thinking of a sequel.The people will remember this film for Ben Foster and Chris Pine. One of the best duo on the screen. Easily one of the best films of the year, but just it is a different theme and genre. I watched it not knowing the meaning of the title, and then I googled it. It is nothing like a must see, but I believe that you might regret if you miss it or delay your watch. So I suggest you make a right choice.8/10",

Set in current day rural west Texas, the movie paints a bleak landscape of small towns with vacant store fronts and ranch lands dotted with For SaleMore a character study than action film, Hell or High Water is not your classic Western.   Set in current day rural west Texas, the movie paints a bleak landscape of small towns with vacant store fronts and ranch lands dotted with For Sale signs.  Average citizens struggle to make ends meet, and not a single character in the movie has a future to look forward to. Their lives twist slowly in the wind, and the slow pace of director David Mackensie’s movie left me feeling much the same way. The economic disparity between the Haves (banks and the oil companies) and the Have Nots has become so burdensome that Toby (Chris Pine) and his ex-convict brother Tanner (Ben Foster) have nothing to left lose by going desperado.  Jeff Bridges plays a deft and skillful sheriff on the verge of a retirement that he’s not looking forward to.  He jokes to his partner about going out in a blaze of glory.  His fatal flaw is a lack of cultural sensitivity which, when combined with an unalterable sense of right and wrong, make it impossible for him to comprehend the cultural and moral schism that is occurring.   The story embodies the kind of social injustice message that Hollywood loves.  Yet, this movie can’t be dismissed so easily.  The message is delivered with more subtleness than blunt force, and the ending is not what you would expect. The acting is solid on all fronts, and there are some guilty pleasures to be had in watching the vigilantes take in on the chin.  Plus, you can psychoanalyze your female friends by asking them if they would do what the waitress did.",

While tentpole films are fun to see because they are events, films like Hell or High Water harken back to when filmmakers were more concerned with telling interesting stories, instead of making easy money. Hell or High Water is engrossing, tells its story with depth and smarts, and features really well-rounded characters. This film is truly a great film in almost all aspects, and will likely get a ton of recognition during oscar season.\rFrom the opening scene of this film, the film is gripping, using both intrigue and acting to its advantage.    Much like many other great films, this film begins with a bang and holds the audience’s attention throughout. Chris Pine has proven that he’s a talented actor over the years, but this film is a major step up for him, that being said the show stealers are Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges. Foster has had amazing performances in the past, but this stands as one of his best, and Bridges plays a role that fits him like a glove, and he does it perfectly.\rThe actors are notably great, but the film is gripping because the story it tells is interesting. The story doesn’t feel like a rip off of other films, and even more impressively tells it’s story with depth and smarts. Nothing in this film feels like it’s unrealistic or bombastic, every action in the film is well thought out and makes sense, that being said the film has a decent level of emotional depth. The impressive thing about Hell or High Water is that it’s not overly sentimental, but it’s the kind of film that still evokes an emotional response.\rPerhaps the biggest reason that the story is interesting, and emotionally gripping is because the characters are so well developed. From the onset all characters come from relatable places, and have plenty of layers. Above that the characters are funny and at some point they simply begin to feel like real people just being captured on film. That being said every character’s conflict hits even harder, because the characters feel so relatable.\rFinding something wrong with this film is extremely hard, and in a day and age with so many films coming out in conjunction that’s rare. Hell or High Water is well acted, gripping, funny, features great characters, shows an impressive amount of emotional depth, and never needlessly substitutes action for smarts. It seems safe to say that this film will get a lot of attention during Oscar season, especially for it’s screenplay. If you’re a fan of westerns, heist films, thrillers, or just in general like great films this film is a good choice.",

This film immediately introduces two brothers, who create such a brilliant on screen chemistry, that it guiltily forces you to almost root for these characters, despite the crimes they are committing, which at first almost brands them as general criminals who have the urge to rob and go with the excitement of a heist – but as the story progresses in its brilliant pace, they’re fleshed out as humane, definitely selfless, and with one of the brothers, regrettable in their actions. Though this film succeeds in its full-bodied character development and emotion resonance with the film following the brothers, its Jeff Bridges and his partner who really add that special extra something. The sense that this may be his final police job due to his many years on the job, and the fact he’s physically weaker than he used to be, could of shifted the genre of the film into a more serious drama, however, a great amount of humour is used between Bridges and his partner – and is done so well that it comes off very unique, and adds the understanding that there is really no villains in this film, and so when the film dramatises involving the main characters, it’s unlike any action scene in other modern movies, because you don’t wish to see any of the characters hurt in anyway. Also, this film carries Texas once again onto the silver screen in great fashion, this film is a brilliant display of the culture in the state, so with all those reasons, despite the rating saying it’s an 8/10, this film gets from me, an 8.5/10 - 88%",

So I guess.. just be always there for all of your favorite people, relatives ones and so one. But this is just really small detail and I'm a virgo, so that explains it all. Great cinematography. No doubt. Clearly, in the last years, there has been some big progress in film shooting, film industry.  And that has set the bar a lot higher. Overall 'Hell or high water' is decent and exiting with it's revenge-action scenes movie, you should watch it and won't be disappointing.

Featuring stellar performances from all the leads involved, the film keeps us on our toes whilst throwing us a few predictable bones here and there just to make us feel smart. But make no mistake, director David McKenzie and writer Taylor Sheridan hold all the cards in this brilliantly plotted caper, leaving the audience with an experience that is somehow both thoroughly enjoyable and unbearably intense at the same time. Really terrific work from everyone before and behind the camera here.",

For the first 75 minutes you wish it 'would just get on' to where it is going though it does have 1-2 minutes of hilarity supplied by Margaret Bowman as a sassy waiteress who wouldn't take any guff from Jack Nicholson giving his order in \"Five Easy Pieces\" let alone from Texas Ranger Jeff Bridges! There is also a lot of give and take between Jeff, who will soon retire, and his Mexican-Comanche partner Gil Birmingham plus the bank robber brothers Chris Pine and Ben Foster.\r The screenwriter Taylor Sheridan offers sharp dialogue between the various 'couples', including an exchange between another waitress played by Katy Mixon who is flirtatious with Pine and then haughty with Bridges who wants to take her $200 tip as evidence. Where the screenplay goes astray is when it delves into the why of the bank robberies and leaves the clever based dialogue.\r The chemistry between older 'black sheep' brother Foster and the 'baby' Pine works from their first appearance to the end and Pine does clean up handsomely! The chemistry between Bridges and Birmingham is just as important between as it is between the brothers and all 4 pay off.\r There is no 'love interest' per se but both Bowman and Mixon women steal the movie from the more 'important' roles of the men. After that hour and 15 minutes of the set up the last 27 minutes grabs you and will surprise the most avid movie goer.\r \"Hell and High Water\" is a low keyed Western thriller cowboy movie  but that scene with Bowman is sure to remain in your herad long after the movie does. It is a classic segment that will probably be watched millions of times on Youtube!!",

More abstract than necessary? More then than now? Achieving balance is an art that has become so scarce across media that it’s almost a niche. What I appreciated most about Hell or High Water was its balance. Its character balance, its action balance, its scripting balance; all held together in a setting that was plausible, convincing, and, well… balanced.\r Action starts almost from the word “GO”, presenting a cast whose members are not necessarily adorable, but whose cause unveils itself over time, whether they be breaking the law or resolutely hell-bent on upholding it. The action itself never leaves you breathless, but the blend of determination by wrong-doers, or righteousness by law enforcers, makes for a homogeneous mix at a steady pace without precipitating into dullness, repetitiveness, or overstaying its welcome in the way that movies of this nature are so easily prone to. With its fair share of violence, the movie expertly steers clear of elements that could otherwise make it gratuitous and predictable. And although there’s profanity, it is cleverly interspersed, delivering impact and realism while avoiding over-indulgence.\r Hell or High Water is a well done, rural, mild but sensible action-adventure that fires on all cylinders with suitable power. Its reasonable suspension makes for a pleasing journey over an enjoyable distance, and it checks all the right boxes amid a sense of maturity that delivers both plot and closure to satisfying expectations.",

Disguised as a western this is really a contemporary chase film whose underlying subject and message could have been written by a Bernie Sanders speech writer. The film stars Chris Pine and Ben Foster who portray two brothers seeking revenge and retribution from the Texas bank that has foreclosed on their family home while Jeff Bridges (playing the same character as he did in “True Grit” and “Crazy Love”) is the Texas Ranger on the trail of these angry young men. The director and cinema photographer more than adequately capture and depict the mood and lifestyle of Western Texas and of those who reside there. The film does, however, raise serious questions as to the morality of the times and how far a person or group, believing he or they have been wronged,  can or should go in order to seek his or their perception of  “justice”. Although most critics have literally raved about this film, it falls short of that kind of an accolade but it is nevertheless a movie to see and enjoy and, for that reason, I give it an 8.",

With terrific performances from Chris Pine, Ben Foster, and Jeff Bridges, Hell or High Water isTexas fried to its very core, Hell or High Water is a film with a deep Southern fried aesthetic from its look, feel, and killer soundtrack/score. With terrific performances from Chris Pine, Ben Foster, and Jeff Bridges, Hell or High Water is a thoroughly unique family-fueled crime film. It may be a touch heavy-handed at times with its anti-bank mentality, but this is more than overcome by its terrifically crafted characters. The brothers are very multi-dimensional, as though they may be criminals, we feel for them deeply because of their circumstances and hope they can get away with it all. That said, even the cops are well developed. Bridges' character and his relationship with Gil Birmingam's character is terrific. Not only is their banter hysterical, but for friends and fellow cops, they are given a shocking amount of depth. In addition to its terrific writing, Hell or High Water is a sturdy film that defies expectations, as is tradition with David Mackenzie's films. He takes typical premises and more than just spruces them up. Instead, he reinvents it and turns it into a fully nuanced and powerful film that explores family relationships and how far you will go to help your family. Even more, it explores the violent nature of man and how thin the line between life and death is and can be. The film's cinematography is also terrific with some seriously beautiful shots strewn through this film. Not only did it capture the Southern aesthetic as previously mentioned, it really captured the look and feel of the towns it was set in. This is also heavily due to the film's terrific production and set design. Overall, Hell or High Water is a real gem set to go down as one of the very best releases of 2016.",

Yet most noticeableHollywood Westerns are not gone, they just underwent a new tone and identity to fit with the times. We do not see any more of those shoot-em-ups against the “Injuns,” but instead a blurred line between sheriff and outlaw. Yet most noticeable of all, it takes place in the here and now, rather than the turn of America’s economic structure.Hell or High Water, written by Sicario’s Taylor Sheridan, shows some of those gritty details that breathe life back into the shallow, feel-good classical genre. Here, we see what Texans under the law truly act like: they use a bulldozer to bury their P.O.S. car under dirt to hide any evidence, and they throw their chips in poker to increase their luck, all with the right rationalizations explained about their backstories to help you understand their turmoil. The two black-masked thieves we focus on here, played by the greatly underrated Chris Pine (Into the Woods, Star Trek) and Ben Foster (3:10 to Yuma, The Messenger), make a living out of hopping from bank-to-bank as the only means to financially secure themselves. You normally wouldn’t want to care for a couple of crooks like them, but once you learn their background, you’ll understand.Sheridan’s plot is not a terribly original concept for a modern-day cowboy movie, virtually copying the same tone and concept as the brilliant No Country for Old Men. This Western only sets itself apart from others by its lack of international relationships.Even so, the hearts of all the men living here will haunt you. Each of them abuses their second amendment rights, even the filthy-rich passerby at the gas station carries firearms at all times. The town by no means chose to side with these crooks, especially not the near-retiring sheriff, played with a compellingly rich voice by Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, Crazy Heart). Despite his wishes, he sets off a cat-and-mouse chase to restore integrity to these disturbers of the peace. Think of it like a Bonnie & Clyde type of thriller, except without the fun, gore, and romance. Or better yet, a Thelma & Louise type of criminal’s sympathy story, except without any strong female characters.Yeah, hate to break it to you: Westerns today still don’t contain enough girl power like we’d expect from them by now. The female characters are either dead mothers we never meet, moral support for the main characters, or bankers who get harassed by the two crooks. If these otherwise talented actresses were made somehow more active, then greater dimension would have been added to make the script strike closer to home.Although the widely unnoticed director David Mackenzie deserves recognition for his compelling creation of Texas’ true culture. In his view of the dead south, automobiles display the ultimate sign of one’s wealth, and oil mines can be found in an average man’s backyard. Although everything looks like the everyday mundane life for these inhabitants, several signs still connect Mackenzie’s imagined world with the works of John Ford. A field fire seen in the distance from behind a herd of frightened cattle heightens the highly-saturated look of the picture, and the dusty texture of the art direction reflects the complexion of the men unqualified to protect the people. You even get a new take on the classic showdown between sheriff and outlaw- with a new psychological twist.Hell or High Water will last as one of those pictures made by men from the old days for men from the old days. Not everyone will come out from the experience satisfied, but for the thinking-type of viewer, Mackenzie’s new take on a familiar concept will knock ‘em out dead.",

It takes great elements from a huge variety of sources and recreates them in it's own, small world while providing only a minimum of context. They're amusing to see, but like the Eiffel Tower in the desert, you know that it's a pale imitation of the original.\r That said, this isn't a bad movie, but it's not nearly the masterpiece that the many 90+ critics' scores might lead you to otherwise believe. The entire movie feels like West Texas written and directed by a NYC film student who knows the geography and people only through watching other movies set in the same location. There are so many cliches in the character creation, the dialog and the cinematography that's it's a bit overwhelming, but contained within the individual scenes are plenty of gems that make the movie worthwhile.\r Bridges and Birmingham are walking on thread-bare, cop-partner carpet. Pine does his best \"Amarillo Raylan Givens\" imitation. Every scene is accompanied by some cliched Texas noir soundtrack music. Once in a while I wished for there to be no music so that I could decide myself on the mood of a particular scene. The recurring billboards on the side of the road are about as subtle as a Roadrunner cartoon. There is absolutely no chemistry between Pine and Ben Foster (his movie brother). There's no reason at all to believe that the two of them would be undertaking something like this together.\r But as mentioned, there are individual scenes that are poignant, funny, sad and pleasantly incongruous which make this a worthwhile spending of your time and money.",

What a let down considering the great word of mouth, solid cast and welcome genre.  Jackass critics over-praise yet again here doing nobody but the makers and themselves a favor!  The idiots obviously grade on a curve.  Do they give this mild effort a break only because everything else is so piss poor?  They're unfit to be giving their worthless opinions on anything.\rJeff Bridges is a very fine actor and one of the great contemporary movie stars.  Lifelong fan and he's in my top three favorite movie stars.  He's good here and all the funny lines are delivered by his character, but that's about all that's good in this film.  The script is weak on story.  Low stakes, high boredom with contrived characters in cliché circumstances that have been put on screen countless times.  The motivating family backstory is not going to be bought by a thinking audience.  Obviously the writer and director were trying to comment on the modern West (actually its Texas here) with their dissertation in the forefront, and the lame story taking the backseat.  Major mistake and it never works.  If you want to do that then go make a documentary, write a book or become a painter because Hollywood movies should always be about strong narrative.  Any kind of message on the nature of things should be sub-text, always!  The audience needs a good story and the rest can filter through sub-consciously or even overtly, but the priority must be on story.  The rookies behind this either don't get that, or just couldn't come up with the goods.  (\"Sicario\" was a pretty phony and thin movie for that matter.)  The tone and craft of this movie are fine and that's what the sheep critics are all flocking around because they are very easily fooled.  It's a slow slog building up to nothing much.\r Also there is a ridiculous logic flaw in the plot, what little plot there is.  And not a flaw but maybe more troubling is a lack of moral subjectivity by the authorship of the film.  The anti-hero is nothing new.  What is are today's Leftist amoral filmmakers who don't pass judgment on extreme violence but show it matter of factly which is more realistic (except for the ubiquitous blood splatter now in shows and movies which is not realistic most of the time and in some ways the old code movies completely devoid of it are actually more realistic), however less reasonable for an audience looking for meaning.  The tone shifts from buddy joking to cold blooded killing by characters the filmmakers intend you to like.  That's not the problem.  The lack of more of a moral payoff is.  The danger is a culture heading for a complete lack of morality in the arts.",

It tells the story of two bank robber brothers, facing the old, fat and decaying hand of the law. Few things happen across the movie, making it very hard to follow, the beginning being the worst part; the western characteristic that defines the film is only noticeable in the climax (and the music), a bit more thrilling and enjoyable. The three main characters are poorly defined mostly superficially. One brother short tempered, not very smart and of unpredictable behavior; the other representing the brain of the gang, with an admirable objective but incoherent parenting; and the near to retirement ranger that wants one last glimpse of adventure. A thing to highlight is the process of recognition that two of these characters go throw as the plot cultivates, and that creates a different outcome however different not in all cases means good.

The police spend most of their time engaged in idle banter and do virtually nothing that might be described as \"police work\" or \"investigating\" unless you include making wild guesses.

It is going to be controversial because as far as I am concerned, most people like this movie and the casts are famous. (but that does not change how I evaluate this movie)\rFirst of all, spoiler alert. This movie's plot is about someone robbing a few banks and manage to get away from it and be rich at the end. And giving a reason (for his kids) so it can be justified. Basically casually robbed a few banks, killing a few civilians and policemen, and sacrifice his brother. If a lot of American like the plot, I am not surprised why plenty of people support Donald Trump. It is no way this concept make any sense to the rest of the world (America is not world if someone is confused).\rBack to the plot, how Toby not being recognised, the cafe lady and 3 cowboys were in the cafe. I could understand the cafe lady might pity Toby by Chris Pine good looking, but surely the 3 cowboys would have recognised him. The car dealer would have recognised him. And the police would also found out he was crossing somewhere very close to the incident where his ID was checked. And only the ranger thinks Toby is the suspect. Anyway, let's settle with the plot.\rActing, the most remarkable actor would be the actress who sold T-bones. The ranger, he is ok, did his character of being a dick, bullying his colleague (again in a justified way so his Mexican colleague would remember him), and he felt sad and joy to take revenge for his death colleague. I suppose there would be some feelings for the ranger character when he went to Toby's place to confront him. Because the ranger thinks and believes Toby is the mastermind behind this thing and should be responsible for the death of his colleague. There might be some acting on those conflicts of the emotions although I could not quite see it (100% because I am not expert in acting).\rAbout filming, the place looks quite pretty, or cinematographic. I suppose I could relate this movie to the style of Revenant. Many pretty sky and landscapes pictures. Unlike the majority preference, I do think the storyline and/or the message behind the movie is more important than those graphics around it. I mean it is nice to have it around. For example, nba2k has good graphics, but gameplay sucks. Hence, nba2k is a **** game. Same principle apply when I watch movies. Nothing against graphics, good to be there, not really upset if it is not there, unless I am watching a documentary.",

I have just seen it even though it had been out for nearly half a year, and have gotten countless recommendations for this movie, as well as seeing lots of positive reviews for it. The movie had also gotten an Oscar nomination for best picture, increasing my expectations. Sadly, I was left unsatisfied.Characters/Acting: The acting was well done; Chris Pine did an excellent job of portraying his character, better than I had expected. I'm looking forward to hopefully seeing him in more dramatic, Oscar-worthy performances in the future. Ben Foster did a good job as well, but Jeff Bridges, in my mind, seemed a bit overrated. He played a very Jeff Bridges character, and though he did have a good range of emotions in a few scenes, he didn't do much throughout the movie. I also didn't feel like there was enough of a connection or comparison between the two pairs of characters (Pine and Foster as brothers and Bridges and Gil Birmingham as the 2 cops). They barely even met, and I didn't feel a good comparison between the two kinds, if that's what the movie was going for.Cinematography: Throughout the duration of the movie, there are countless, and I mean perpetual, endless shots of the small, depressed lands of Texas that the movie takes place in. Eventually I found the shots boring and repetitive, to the point where I was almost saying \"if I see another shot of a barren wasteland in Texas, I'm going to throw my remote into the television.\"Overall, the movie isn't necessarily bad; it's an okay way to kill two hours. If I didn't have such high expectations from what I had read and other people suggesting it for me, I may have knocked the rating up to a 7.Also, whenever you see it, stick around for the T-bone restaurant scene, it's the best and funniest scene of the whole movie.",

I wanted to get that out of the way because I have a serious complaint about this film. Hell or High Water spends most of its time in a realistic place. It paints a picture of two brothers who have a realistic life with believable relationships with both each other and the world around them. It also paints a realistic scenario that, while not without holes, certainly gives a purpose behind the bank robbing and other shenanigans. Hell and High Water is also a fable. Not quite of the Magic Realism kind that one easily could have seen this film drift into but of the wish fulfillment kind. The kind one would expect in a children's adventure. In other words the ending of The Goonies. Now one could easily argue if The Goonies ending worked for well The Goonies but it simply doesn’t strike true to a film that admittedly was getting looser with reality as it went along. Upon reflection one certainly, could imagine that the writer or director was well aware that they were drifting into fable territory and simply loosened the rules of the world of the film as events progressed. I certainly am willing to give this finely crafted film this. The ending just seemed too clean for a film so otherwise grounded. The equivalent of a ghost pirate ship drifting in the background.Speaking of endings souring an otherwise fine experience. The inclusion of a blasting Black Sabbath song at the end of the first Iron Man worked because well it's and Iron Man movie and it's an Iron Man song. This film is drifting quietly into the sunset and suddenly we are blasted with this loud obnoxious country rock song (Outlaw State of Mind by Chris Stapleton) that doesn’t fit the scene, or mood and honestly at that point doesn’t fit the film. The film overall is great, The acting is more than solid all across the board and the film spends the vast majority of its running time in a good place. Like I said a very good film overall.",

No digamos ya que merezcan la pena. \"Hell or high water\" no será recordado como un gran éxito ni como una película de culto (al menos ahora). Sin embargo dentro de unos años, en un conversación donde salgan películas de este genero, a cada cual mas moderna, llegará un punto que tras nombrar \"No es país para viejos\" la gente se quedará pensando. Entonces alguien dirá; ¿os acordáis de esta película?, estaba realmente bien, me dejó sin poder pensar en otra cosa durante un buen rato. Y se pensará que estaba muy bien dirigida, pero que tampoco tenía nada transcendental.Es entonces cuando un segundo visionado pondrá a esta película en su lugar. Cuando la vuelvas a ver, recordando ligeramente lo que iba a ocurrir, te darás cuenta de lo trascendental que es. O mejor dicho, de como con algo tan simple, te puede hacer ver tantos detalles. Esa sensación de estar ante algo que no habías visto antes y que te muestra distintos puntos de vista a los que tenías, esa sensación no la tienen ni muchas grandes películas. \"Hell or high water\" no consigue eso en su totalidad como película, lo consigue en algo mas pequeño, algo que se que está ahí y que creo haberlo visto varias veces.Puede que me equivoque y sea lo contrario. Puede que algún día vuelva a verla porque me he acordado de ella y ya no vea esa calidad, bien porque era superficial, bien porque no había.

The cinematography was beautiful, Giles Nuttgens really captured the beauty of the countryside. The script was tight and engrossed me into the movie. And I loved the chemistry between Ben Foster's and Chris Pine's character, they really showed the sibling love these two characters have for each other.

As far as movie goers go, I may be an exception, but I have a complete lack of romanticism with the American West. I understand the merit of older westerns, but nowadays, they tend to just seem dated. But something about Jeff Bridges in a Texas desert seems right. I’m also a sucker for a good screenplay and some risky robbery scenes, and right off the bat this film lets you know that is what you are in for. The contrast between the four main characters, the two brothers and two rangers, drive the narrative to a point to where you aren’t sure who you are rooting for by the time the climactic scene begins. So if you like bank robberies, Chris Pine’s eyes, and dramatic scenes of cars being buried, you should check this out. 8.7/10",
