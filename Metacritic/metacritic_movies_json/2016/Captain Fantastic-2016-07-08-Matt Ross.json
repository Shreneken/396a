  "summary": "In the forests of the Pacific Northwest, a father (Viggo Mortensen) devoted to raising his six kids with a rigorous physical and intellectual education is forced to leave his paradise and enter the world, challenging his idea of what it means to be a parent.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Captain Fantastic leaves viewers with the cheering, deeply affecting image of a dad whose superpowers lie in simply doing the best that he can.",
    "Anchored by Viggo Mortensen's prismatic portrayal of Ben, this is one of the summer's nicest movie surprises, and among its wisest.",
    "Ben is the family’s rock, and Mr. Mortensen gives the story unshakable grounding. He’s a star who doesn’t act like a star, yet everyone in his orbit feels his power. He and this strong, adventurous film deserve each other.",
    "The movie really belongs to Mortensen, who allows Ben to be exasperating, arrogant and impatient but also warm, loving and caring. He’s a tough but adoring father, a grieving widower and an angry defender of his wife’s final wishes, and Mortensen plays all these notes and more with subtlety and grace.",
    "Mortensen has been ideally cast. He’s at his best playing fanatics, obsessives, people beyond the norm who can’t find their place in a quiet world.",
    "Written and directed by Matt Ross — who is perhaps best known for his role as Alby on the HBO series “Big Love” — the film raises questions not only about what it means to be a responsible parent but also about what constitutes a meaningful life.",
    "The film doesn't take sides, but it does fairly, subtly and movingly represent them. Captain Fantastic takes a piece out of you.",
    "Captain Fantastic isn’t only one of the year’s best movies, but one of the best cast and best acted, right down to the smaller roles.",
    "Despite a frustrating fizzle of a finale, it’s a movie that enthralls the senses and engages the mind for two hours, proving no movie is too long when you’re having fun.",
    "Above all else, however, Mortensen gives Captain Fantastic its underlying credibility.",
    "It’s a testament to writer-director Matt Ross, who is probably best known as an actor on shows like Big Love and Silicon Valley, that Captain skirts cliché as well as it does; his indictments of both contemporary emptiness and misguided idealism feel earned, even if it all ties up a little too Sundance-tidy in the end.",
    "Though the film struggles to wrap up the proceedings in an overlong final act, it thankfully stays true to its characters by not oversimplifying a complicated subject.",
    "A road movie with heart, humour and a lead prepared to give his youthful co-stars their share of the limelight.",
    "A fiercely original, pleasantly unpredictable character piece. This is a gang of outsiders with something valuable to say about the world we live in.",
    "As the father-in-law, Langella has one of those thankless antagonist roles — the rigid, killjoy patriarch — that older actors take for the paycheck and almost never pull off. As usual these days, he’s remarkable.",
    "Through it all, you can’t stop watching Ben, Mortensen’s character. At some point, though, you realize it’s no longer because you admire him for his ideals but want to strangle him for his undying adherence to them.",
    "Not only is it wonderful – it is heartfelt, comedic, gorgeous and just the right amount of sad.",
    "It’s left to Mr. Mortensen, who can make menace feel like vulnerability — and turn vulnerability into a confession — to keep the movie from slipping into sentimentality. He’s the most obvious reason to see it, although Mr. Ross’s insistence on taking your intelligence for granted is itself a great turn on.",
    "Gorgeously photographed, and as loosey-goosey as its hero, Captain Fantastic takes some unexpected turns. Is Ben eccentric or irresponsible? Is he raising free-thinking iconoclasts — or training a new generation of Unabombers?",
    "Ross doesn’t run from the resulting sentimentality the way so many other directors do; nor does he undercut it with irony or sarcasm as has become the regrettable tendency in independent cinema.",
    "Matt Ross’ screenplay occasionally stumbles (especially late in the proceedings) and the ending opts for a too-facile resolution but the director/writer offers moments of genuine power and pathos that make it easy to forgive the missteps.",
    "So where’s the line between rigid parental standards and possible abuse? Captain Fantastic crab-walks tentatively toward that question, and even though its conclusion feels rushed, the movie still works as a portrait of an unorthodox family that’s well adjusted in its own odd way.",
    "For a while, the freeing experience of the clan’s nonconformity gets tamped down, and the movie appears headed toward some kind of moralized conclusion. Once back on familiar ground, however, Captain Fantastic rights itself toward as happy an ending as possible, without too much compromise.",
    "The dialogue is dense and quick and brainy.",
    "An earthy, funny and sometimes poignant portrait of a family that could only exist in the fantasy of the movies.",
    "We’re primed to expect that the culture clash, when it comes, will be powerful and dangerous. Instead, the film suddenly backs down, and the resulting learning and growing feels like chickening out.",
    "The movie works best in the clan’s private world (even if rock climbing in the rain seems like poor parenting). But then it deflates: Frank Langella, normally a welcome presence, is clownishly directed as a mean grandfather, and the plot abandons its tensions too abruptly.",
    "Captain Fantastic is a slickly made comedy with a witty, politically articulate script and some wonderful cinematography by former Jacques Audiard regular Stéphane Fontaine.",
    "To those outside his bubble, it can look at best like a form of child abuse, at worse like a cult: the nuclear family as survivalist militia.",
    "By the end, Ross’ initially disarming fusion of cleverness and whimsy has curdled into a dispiritingly familiar mix of sentimentality and self-satisfaction.",
    "Especially refreshing, even radical, is its sympathy for characters who read for pleasure and value rigorous thought. Unfortunately, by the end, it’s gone as mushy and ragged as a homespun hemp blanket.",
    "Captain Fantastic uses bleak but gentle comedy to pinpoint the variety of ways we wrestle with grief, but the film undermines Mortensen's performance and its own thematic ambitions by presenting the character as little more than an idealized fantasy figure.",
    "Like the family at its centre, Captain Fantastic is an odd bird, sometimes endearing, sometimes unbelievable.",
    "Captain Fantastic loses its intriguing premise in a muddle of ideas about the redemptive power of family and the right of all people to live as they please.",
    "Captain Fantastic treats the situation (and Ben) so uncritically and so sympathetically that there is a total disconnect between what is actually onscreen and what Ross thinks is onscreen.",
    "The film is premised on a radical act that it buries beneath a grueling avalanche of quirk."

This unconventional family drama addresses a host of poignant issues (some flattering, some critical) on both ends of the social and ideological spectra, raising valid points for consideration and debate (one can only hope, though, that a currently polarized America will have the patience to take the time to listen to each side).

When their mother dies, they board their bus to pay their respects. While the kids are all intellectually accomplished and physically trained, their encounters with civilization (and their mother's relatives) prove challenging. This unique story is filled with moments that are charming and captivating, thanks partly to the sweet, sensitive performances of the children (and Mortensen, of course). There may be scenes that strain credibility, but the way the story is told provides a fascinating and ultimately engaging look at a very special family.",

Always an excellent actor here he is even one step better than other times. Besides holding your attention in everyIn “Captain Fantastic” Viggo Mortensen, as Ben Cash, is a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination and, possibly, winning the statute! Always an excellent actor here he is even one step better than other times. Besides holding your attention in every scene he is in, including, yes, his required full frontal nudity shot, there are two short scenes that will mesmerize you with one being the screen filled with his full face from the chin up that expresses pain, hurt and puzzlement so distinctively you won’t be able to miss what is going through his emotions. In the second scene, with his son, played by George Mackay, who should certainly get a supporting nomination, they are both so forceful in what they feel you won’t breathe until the camera moves on to the next scene.\rThe story is a simple one of a couple who raise their 6 kids, ranging in ages from about 5-18, in the mountains and forests of the upper Northwest away from civilization. They are taught survival, are home schooled and in the evening they read, eat, play music and talk politics, philosophy and whatever else is on their mind. The opening scene is one of the oldest son becoming a ‘man’ by killing a deer for food, which, thankfully, is over quickly.\rTheir mother has been away for 3 months in the hospital for a bipolar condition and they are all shocked, including dad, when his sister, Kathryn Hahn, calls to tell him that their wife/mother had committed suicide. Though his father-in-law, Frank Langella, doesn’t want him coming to the funeral he has all intentions of fulfilling his wife’s Last Will and Testament and so he piles the kids into their school bus camper and takes them into the outside world.\r“Captain Fantastic” is a roller coaster ride having you gasping by the deer, or other animal, killing followed by the laughing of the youngest asking “What is sexual intercourse?” or her older brother kissing a girl for the first time and then tears streaming down your face as you realize that as much as Ben loves his kids he may be hurting them more and could lose them.\rIn a cast of standouts, including all the kids and Steve Zahn along with Ann Dowd, the dominating figure is Viggo Mortensen followed closely by George MacKay’s performance. Each of the kids have a chance to shine whether it is using the ‘f’ word, in a funny way, or a teenage girl discussing “Lolita” and her feelings about the old man or a boy, not knowing how to deal with death, ‘turning’ on his father.\r“Captain Fantastic” just misses being an excellent film due to a bad musical soundtrack, being a few minutes too long and turning to a ‘Hollywood’ ending which wasn’t needed.\rThe film is rated R due to Mortensen’s full frontal nudity, language, adult themes and talk, the latter mainly by the kids dealing with mature subjects.\rYears ago I said I would stop going to the movies if Charlize Theron didn’t win the Oscar for “Monster” and at this point I feel the same way about Mortensen’s performance!.",

This much buzzed about Sundance hit works on many levels, thanks mainly to Viggo Mortensen's charming and often times gripping performance, as well as the performances from the actors who played his six children. The film's story however felt a little uneven at times and unsure of where to go or what to say. Granted however, there were also many times where it had its fair share of both funny and heartbreaking moments. Overall, it's a decent enough film worth seeing if you want to see Mortensen in another great dramatic turn that has some fun, quirky moments to spare.",

Certainly there are many comical scenes which would make laugh even a calm person. But the movie raises a lot of problems, and it ask a viewer to make his/her own opinion - it does not have good or bad characters. Probably, a viewer would determine each character by themselves according to his/her own preferences and beliefs. All in all, actors play their characters very well - even the smaller children. It is also interesting, how some dialogues which do not have much sense in the first half of film receive their own resemblance in the events of the film later, obtaining a rather serious meaning, if you watch the film carefully, of course. It is not the movie to relax and at certain points it should make you sad or even cry, if you are sentimental one. But you should stay aware that this movie is not about its plot - its about showing the situation, around which script is written. You should not expect much of the development - you mostly get to know different sides of characters and obtaining your own opinion about them.\rI would suggst this movie to almost anyone, but not when you want to relax and ave a lil'bit o'laughter with a couple of friends. Get ready to watch it closely, or you might just as well stay dissatisfied, because by watching casually you can't get it at all.",

Featuring a phenomenal leading turn from Viggo Mortensen, Captain Fantastic is a funny, charming, and moving little indie film from writer and director Matt Ross. A terrific calling card for future success, Ross has established himself as a man to watch with a nearly phenomenal work that is his most mainstream film to date. The entire cast is more than able in this little indie film about a man and his kids who live in the forests of the Pacific Northwest. An incredibly philosophical film about child rearing, acceptance, and balance, the film is incredibly well-written with its characters carrying a considerable amount of nuance. Nobody is all good and nobody is all bad, instead there is an incredible amount of things we will never understand about those we encounter. The film does a great job balancing these themes, while still telling a truly engaging story and building a world that we can really dive into and enjoy. Overall, Captain Fantastic is a sneaky little indie film that has flashes of brilliance, but its ending is a really let down.",

They might know something but most important, we do not teach them to think. Kids don't do enough exercise, do not know how to survive, do not know discipline.\rI like the movie to put that education to that extreme, to bring up the controversy. It is that to start a discussion. I would argue if the character is smart enough to incorporate both his home school with actual school. It will be too perfect and end the discussion.\rWhat it brings out is if you teach your kids 'properly' i.e. to read, to think critically, to understand, there are a lot the kids can get from it (and the current education fails to deliver, the so call education experts can shut up, I do not care about your statistic, the fact is kids have a problem). However, it also demonstrates the other extreme of  home school which is the lack of social interaction. I think this movie should spark a discussion on our current education system.\rI believe in the state, people need to declare.\rI declare I am working in a university.

The idea of raising your children in the nature, free from consumerism and having a healthy life is what every teenager dreams and claims to their friends, that he or she will do it in the future. The thing is that just like those dreams die when the person grows up, the story fades as the film goes by. It never became clear what concept the protagonist was trying to avoid: capitalism, consumerism, occidental culture; just was choosing a healthier life form; all those things or none. The plot was to light for a whole movie, with too many inconsistencies that make difficult its understanding. Beside that, Viggo Mortensen gives a nice performance, even some of the kids did well too; the family issue with the grandparents is interesting and well developed and last but not least, it never turns boring, which surely required a lot of work considering all said.",

Sure.. all of the sentiments this family believe in are probably   more solid than  most of today's families..but so what? Who cares?

One of the best films of the yearsSurviving isn't just a good education, but needs the physical training.This is from a supporting actor turned a director who is just one film old before this. So he wrote and directed this beautiful film. One of the best films of the years that should be in must see list. It was just like the film 'Alabama Moon', only the initial plot that extended for over the hundred minutes. The first thing is the cast, it was the best combination. Lots of future stars are here. It was more like a road movie, except in the opening few minutes.I did not like the entire film, I found a couple of things uncomfortable. Like the killing a deer in the opening scene and the end part. The conclusion was good, I thought it was the best solution for such a story, not for the theme. But then the final shot gave me an impression that they had got compromised. After all these years hard work, I felt they had given up. That did not stop me from enjoying it and recommending it to the others. Still, it is a very unique film that tried its best to avoid the usual cliché.This is the story of a father of six kids, raising them by his own outside the society in the wilderness. But the children are not left behind on the knowledge of the world, especially the philosophies theirs favourite topic. They are bright, as well as tough and can survive in any condition. One day when they get a message that their mother died, the journey begins to attend the funeral and during their way all the adventures are what we're going to witness.Due to the copyright issue the birthday song was altered. Surprisingly, the film was not based on any book. So my utmost appreciation goes to the creator of this wonderful product. Surely it will be a cult classic. It has lots of great dialogue, and bold revelations in a simple way about the facts of the world. Especially like related to the sex and other grown up stuffs clarifying the little kids' doubts.At some point I thought it was okay for the kids to watch with their parents, but it did not get better on that perspective. I mean having lots of main characters as children, the film is not good for their watch. Though the adults should not miss it, even though you are a religious person or any other kind. So highly recommended by me.8/10",

O ato de contar uma história é mágico por si só, porém, quando a história que nos é contada vem em um belo filme, tudo se torna ainda melhor. Quando se trata de contar uma história, Matt Ross (que dirige e escreve o longa) sabe o que está fazendo. Capitão Fantástico nos trás a história de uma família que resolve fugir do que é considerado comum para a maior parte das pessoas. Ben cria seus seis filhos na floresta, longe de qualquer sinal da civilização. Ele e sua mulher os educam da forma que acham apropriadas, assim Bo, Vespyr, Kierly , Zaja, Rellian e Nai crescem já cientes das crueldades do mundo e são treinados desde criança pelo pai para o qualquer tipo de situação possível.  Entretanto, a história começa mesmo quando a mãe das crianças comete suicídio, e assim damos inicio a uma jornada primordialmente sobre a importância da família, percas e os principios da civilização em nossas vidas. Crianças lendo sobre Marxismo e manifesto comunista são uma das coisas que vemos com frequência aqui. O filme, no inicio, nos dá uma sensação de uma propaganda socialista que é totalmente desconstruída ao decorrer do filme. Vemos um tipo de sociedade estabelecia nesta pequena família que funciona perfeitamente dentro de seus próprios padrões. O roteiro trata com profundidade a relação de irmão para com irmão e de pai para com filhos. Ben é visto não somente como pai mas como capitão, do qual as crianças sentem enorme respeito.  Viggo Mortensen está em uma de suas melhores performances aqui. Sua atuação precisa nos dá toda a dimensão que o roteiro precisa passar para que o personagem funcione. O posto de líder é perfeitamente executado por Viggo  na pele de Ben. É difícil imaginar outro ator para esse papel.    Entre os filhos quem se destaca é George McKay como Bo. McKay soube dar profundidade ao personagem que oscila entre parecer confiante e inteligente e completamente vulnerável e inocente. Os dois personagens tem um dos melhores diálogos do filme, onde Bo finalmente diz o que está preso em sua garganta a muito tempo para seu pai.A direção suave de Matt Ross acompanha o roteiro. Durante o filme temos várias cenas abertas nos enfatizando a natureza e nos oferecendo com profundidade o ambiente em que aqueles personagens vivem. Ross nunca é ambicioso, sua câmera se move suavemente, sua direção é sensível e faz um contraste perfeito com o roteiro que nos oferece a mesma sensibilidade.  O filme nos proporciona um encontro perfeito entre dois mundos quando os personagens se deslocam de seu porto seguro para se aventurar no mundo considerado normal.  Ben e seus filhos parecem igualmente deslocados vivendo cercados por tudo aquilo que eles desprezam.  O filme também possui uma dose de humor negro que constantemente entra em contraste com a carga emocional que esses personagens carregam. Poucos filmes nos últimos anos trabalharam tão bem a relação entre seres humanos como Captain Fantastic. Os ensinamentos filosóficos de Ben para seus filhos nos inspira e o longa cumpre muito bem seu papel ao mostrar todos os lados de uma mesma situação e aprofundar seus próprios questionamentos filosóficos.",

But when you start a movie by killing and eating a reindeer, and the best gift the father gives the 6 years old kid is a pocket knife then you have the impression the message is not what you expected. I believe the director wanted to share a lot of messages, healthy food, minimalism, natural life and character development. But I found the movie full of forced cliches and too exaggerated which left me most of the time with mixed feelings. At the end the kids go to a normal school? Really?

Matt Ross's work is plausible as a director but its writing skills overpowers it and feels a bit unsatisfactory as it itself fails to justify it whilst projecting the anticipated vision on screen. The young actors are supporting convincingly but at the heart of it lies a genuinely moving performance carried off by Viggo Mortensen as a single parent trying to befriend and teach his kids. Captain Fantastic is aware of its eerie bubble created on script and hence spends its first half on setting the characters through it after which it shows its bright and poetic colours that paints this stunning craft.",

It was based on a good idea, but it is written so poorly it ruins the whole movie. They are so bad at exploiting ideas. One of the main ideas is the critic of modern society. We get it but do they have to push this narrative so hard? With kids talking like literary students, with the cardio of athletes who like to do extreme mountain climbing as a family activity. And of course they have to throw every Marxist clichés in the book, it doesn’t fit the narrative. If only Viggo’s character was Nietzschian, it would have made sense. A Nietzschian father trying to raise his child to become superhuman. Then they could have played with the idea of when is it okay to follow an ideology and when is dangerous.Instead they throw some Marxist clichés who don’t really make sense in this context. Every time they could have done something interesting, they close the door. Like in the restaurant scene, when the young children’s ask about pancake and cola. It would have been a great opportunity to have a scene where the father is confronted by his children who realized that this is good food and that their father might not be right. Instead they finish that scene abruptly and go with the hunting scene that make absolutely no sense.",
