    "critic_reviews": [
        "Just over fifty years after A Man for All Seasons won six Oscars including Best Picture and Best Actor for Paul Scofield, Fred Zinnemann\u2019s adaptation of Robert Bolt\u2019s stage play has found unique points of modern relevance.",
        "A faithful and beautifully impressive transition to the screen of Robert Bolt's superb historical play.",
        "A Man for All Seasons is a picture that inspires admiration, courage and thought.",
        "Producer-director Fred Zinnemann has blended all filmmaking elements into an excellent, handsome and stirring film version of A Man For All Seasons.",
        "Director Zinnemann never allows his primarily stage-trained actors to indulge in theatrical over-emoting. This absorbing film features inventive camerawork and superior production values.",
        "This 1966 drama ticks most of the right boxes when it comes to entertaining as well as educating.",
        "A Man for All Seasons offers an engaging, if somewhat dry, history lesson leavened with enough low-key drollness and powerful acting to keep it from ever becoming boring.",
        "Prestigious, well turned out piece of British historical drama with enough genuine intrigue and wit to persuade some audiences they aren't watching a history lesson.",
        "An agonisingly respectable, sincere film of Robert Bolt's literate play, with Scofield as Sir Thomas More, endorsing the divine right of the Pope over and above his King.",
        "Robert Bolt's boring historical drama functions best as an anthology of British acting styles, circa 1966."
