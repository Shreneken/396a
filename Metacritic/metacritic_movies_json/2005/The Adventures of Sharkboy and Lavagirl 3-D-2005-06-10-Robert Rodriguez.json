  "summary": "From the wild imagination of a child and the digital vision of director Robert Rodriguez comes this magical, original, not to mention three-dimensional, family entertainment.  (Dimension Films)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "There is such a joy of play in the film that it's easy to overlook the overdone performances and the lazy script shortcuts.",
    "You can't get this kind of full-on sensory-jolt anywhere else, not legally anyway. \"Sharkboy\" will be equally beloved in elementary schools and in college dorms.",
    "Slight but immensely enjoyable charmer.",
    "On the whole it feels genuine. Lautner and Dooley are compelling as the sullen, instinctual Sharkboy and the radiant, hot-headed Lavagirl, and it's easy to see why they dominate shy, hesitant Max's dreams.",
    "Robert Rodriguez and his kids conjure up a charming 3-D fantasy.",
    "An often imaginative though less than magical family feature.",
    "There's little chance of grabbing teens (or even many tweens) during summertime playdates. Still, small fry will be enchanted by this rambunctious action-adventure.",
    "The result is like a low-rent \"Wizard of Oz\" or \"Labyrinth,\" sticking close to the formula of a kid who falls asleep and wakes up in a fantastical wonderland where everything's just a little bit off.",
    "A case of a yummy yarn spoiled by cheesy visuals.",
    "Only part of it is in 3-D, but youngsters should enjoy pulling their special specs on and off at appropriate moments.",
    "Charmingly low-tech fantasy.",
    "A strange Hollywood film, but for a home movie it's one bang-up job.",
    "Because the real world scenes are in 2-D and the dream and fantasy scenes are in 3-D, we get an idea of what the movie would have looked like without the unnecessary dimension. Signs flash on the screen to tell us when to put on and take off our polarizing glasses, and I felt regret every time I had to shut out those colorful images and return to the dim and dreary 3-D world. On DVD, this is going to be a great-looking movie.",
    "For a movie aimed at children, Shark Boy and Lava Girl is gloomy.",
    "Like choral singing and travel photography, this adventure is more fun for participants than it is for spectators.",
    "A story that would be charming if recited at the dinner table tries to carry a feature film, and it's not even close to the task. The result is screamingly bad.",
    "Mr. Rodriguez seems unsure what his film is really about, making the moral of the story -- \"dream an unselfish dream\" -- feel more like a vaguely judgmental homily than a satisfying conclusion.",
    "There's really just not a lot here. I'm sure Racer's story will entertain the very wee ones -- but so do keys.",
    "The story's so sloppy that it contradicts itself constantly.",
    "There's sad news to report about The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D: Put on the cardboard glasses, and you can still see the movie.",
    "The low-tech film looks like a kid's crude drawing, plays like entry-level Game Boy, and is about as nourishing as a Tootsie Pop.",
    "As sweet and hopeless and silly as a doting dad framing his second-grader's latest finger-painting and calling it a Matisse.",
    "Pretty lame.  Sharkboy has an especially frantic, amateur atmosphere, with a mostly maladroit cast.",
    "Based on characters created by Rodriguez's then-seven-year-old son, Racer Max, the film doesn't belong in wide release. It belongs on a refrigerator door, alongside \"100%\" spelling tests, old lunch menus, and notices from the PTA.",
    "Sadly, the film's creaky, sometimes painful dialogue makes it all too easy to believe that it was genuinely co-written by a small child.",
    "The concept is cute and the movie starts out well, but it devolves into a muddled, overstuffed mess that wears out its welcome around the time the novelty of 3-D effects wears off.",
    "One could forgive a budget this threadbare, performances this amateurish, a plot this tortuous if the 3-D effects passed the cool test. Sadly, watching ''Adventures\" is an experience akin to seeing the world through dung-colored glasses.",
    "Sharkboy relies almost entirely on 3-D for its kicks. The novelty, however, quickly wears thin with the thinnest of stories to project.",
    "Visually undistinguished, narratively inert, populated by a cast of charmless child actors, \"Sharkboy and Lavagirl,\" with any luck will fade quickly from theaters, memories and Rodriguez's own Things to Do Today list.",
    "A bizarre, hopelessly muddled fantasy that's likely to induce utter bewilderment in its target audience.",
    "The result is astoundingly boring and, frankly, tedious to sit through."

Unfortunatly the 3D just makes the movie look dumber, as for the jokes, I did even smile at them. Half the time I couldn't even tell that they were supposed to be jokes. It seemed as though the characters were just pointless stating facts. And did I mention the acting, it sucked! Also it's unfair that a young boy gets to come up with stories from movies, just because his father is a director. All kids have a great imagination, what makes Racer's ideas so special. I could write a better story than him without even trying",

I knew it got bad reviews, but since they said it was going to be bad, did they still watch Spy Kids 1-3 and usually blame a 3-D kids movie by Robert Rodriguez? No. They just want to be the center of attention yip-yapping those negative feedbacks. I gotta give credit to Robert Rodriguez. Even though he still has a loyal fanbase to those who want to become the next Antonio Banderas or Salma Hayek, he still makes more action movies like Sin City and Machete. That's a good director, maybe he will be making his star into the Hollywood Walk of Fame someday. It's a great movie if you haven't seen it, I watched a little bit on the Cartoon Network.

The 3d effects does look gimmicky and cheezy, but i understand it was all made in the name of fun. The execution of the effects look rushed though, as there were some major flaws in the compositing with the live action and 3D world. I'm sure Rodriguez had much better things to do with his other upcoming projects than to scrutinize the technical details of his child's film. Or maybe he left that role of supervising to his kiddy son??? Anyway, the movie did offer some creative yet juvenile moments of mini-genius ideas all rolled into a big fat supersized burger.

As performances são fracas, bem fracas, até mesmo para crianças. não acredito que esteja diretamente relacionado a uma falta de talento, e sim de direção adequada. Ao menos eu gostei muito dos movimentos de Taylor Lautner jovem hehe.A mensagem quanto aos sonhos é valida, por conta do publico alvo, mas poderia ir mais além. O filme não é sustentável para o publico mais velho, sem duplo sentido ou demais camadas no humor ou em metáforas.

Taylor Lautner was okay, but he portrayed Sharkboy as a character that was always mad, and it became monotonous after the first twenty minutes or so. Cayden Boyd Was okay as Max, but he seemed uninterested at times, and he looked like he was about to throw up when he was supposed to be crying, which left a bad taste in my mouth.\r PLOT - 3\rThe plot was very disconnected and felt like it kept changing all of the time, which left me confused at points. The plot seemed utterly ridiculous in the first place, causing all of the changes to just make it worse.\r SPECIAL EFFECTS - 7\rFor constant special effects composed in a 2005 film, this was a good attempt. The lava was almost realistic and Mr. Electric was somewhat impressive. Although some special effects were awfully cheesy, most of them were pretty solid.\r OVERALL - 4.6 (4)\rAlthough Sharkboy and Lavagirl may impress toddlers, it will not impress anyone else. As a \"family film\", it leaves the rest of the family in pure torture of having to sit through this.",

I recall it as being one of my favourite films as young one. I recently watched sharkboy and lavagirl again as a teenager and was just appalled. First off, the cgi is god awful in this film and it looked as though it was made for a toys r us advert! The whole concept is just f@!&ing bulls%^t and honestly could've been written by a 5 year old. Some may argue in saying that it was built for young children and it is and many children and toddlers enjoy it. But the kid films that really entertain are the one's that are built for ALL ages. Why do you think disney/pixar films are so popular? So, sharkboy and lavagirl is a good film to put on for your children when they are very young but if they decide to watch it again when they are older like me...they're probably going to be dissapointed.",

I like Robert Rodriguez and thought his first two Spy Kids moviesI personally have no real problem with 3D, as long as it is done well and has a good story and characters. Sadly, that's where The Adventures of SharkBoy and Lava Girl fails. I like Robert Rodriguez and thought his first two Spy Kids movies were very enjoyable and while mediocre I actually thought the third Spy Kids film was better than this too. I will give some credit, the moral is decent if hardly original and there is some energy. But everything else falls flat.People might say the art direction was colourful and pleasing to the eye. Sorry, for me it was very tacky, gaudy and brash. And as for the 3D, it is actually some of the worst I've seen, it needed more clarity and sharpness and sometimes moved too fast. Also I found it distracting in alternative to enhancing. The soundtrack is rather plodding, generic and unmemorable too.The script is absolutely awful too. Any parts that tried to be funny made me roll my eyes to be perfectly honest with you, while the story is unevenly paced and very weak and predictable. The characters are just as weak and bland too, the two main characters have their likable moments but there is little chemistry between them and the audience while the supporting characters fare even worse suffering either from being underused or overacted. Overall, the acting is very uneven and way too broad in some cases.Other disappointments are the poor pace and plodding direction from Rodriguez. So in conclusion, the result is a pretty awful, overstuffed and disappointing effort of a family film. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

Lo que si me disgusto fueron los gráficos que podrían haberse visto mucho mejor, principalmente los efectos especiales, y aunque los escenarios también algunos son muy básicos a nivel técnico, otros gozan de un buen apartado artístico. Tiene buenos villanos, buenas moralejas y personajes (bastante memorables). Lo que si que a veces siento que esta película se pasa de estúpida en algunas partes, y casi como que es algo que caracteriza a Robert Rodriguez, porque por si no lo sabían, la historia original fue sugerida por sus hijos.En general, la disfrute bastante, y me sorprende muchas de las criticas negativas la verdad.
