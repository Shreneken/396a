    "summary": "A battered woman finds an unlikely hero in a transient young man who breaks into empty homes while the residents are away.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Quiet, mysterious, sometimes violent, ultimately close to sublime.",
        "Alternately witty, caustic, tender and endlessly imaginative and unpredictable.",
        "The insinuating quality of 3-Iron is irresistible.",
        "This enigmatic and in some ways maddening motion picture has the power to haunt every viewer it reaches.",
        "Creates a thoroughly curious combination of tension and eroticism.",
        "It's a love story without all the verbal hooey and it hits harder than most.",
        "A rarefied love story, conducted with no dialogue between the principals.",
        "3-Iron gains its hypnotic power by observing these characters through a slight remove. With total command of his effects, Kim transforms an already peculiar romance into something as otherworldly as a ghost story.",
        "A teasing, self-conscious and curiously heartfelt demonstration of his (Mr. Kim)  mischievous formal ingenuity.",
        "The illicit lovers in this eerie South Korean drama communicate whole worlds without ever speaking.",
        "It's a film that will stay with you.",
        "It sounds high-minded, but 3-Iron is in fact simple and economical, blessedly straighforward, absorbing, and hard to forget.",
        "Kim's wittiest effort to date, with a wordless performance by Jae Hee that recalls Keaton and Chaplin.",
        "3-Iron is like a Raymond Carver story that slowly, inexorably takes on the dimensions of a ghostly fairy tale.",
        "Dreamlike and the slightest bit precious, the film is a beautiful, over-cultivated hothouse flower.",
        "The sooner you let yourself go with Kim's flow, the more likely you are to come away satisfied. Think of it as South Korea's answer to \"Memento,\" just don't think too hard.",
        "Beguilingly odd.",
        "Original, imaginative and stylish.",
        "Taut even when ridiculous, with flashes of comedy, 3-Iron has less to offer than its predecessors, but at minimum it's the playful exhaustion of a formal constraint.",
        "The almost supernatural turn which Kim's lovely film takes during its final act, however, is totally unexpected, and just one reason why Kim ranks as one of the most justly celebrated talents in contemporary Korean cinema.",
        "It's actually quite satisfying, in a weird, magical-realism sort of way that manages to disturb and confound as much as it appeases the romantic.",
        "As a writer-director, he's (Kim Ki-Duk) a wizard with the camera but a plebe with a pen. His latest, 3-Iron, continues the frustrating trend.",
        "The result is slightly less interesting and less appealing even as arthouse fare.",
        "3-Iron is at times deliciously sensual, creepily somnolent, whimsically spiritual and disturbingly violent. But it is never quite coherent.",
        "A compelling, if obscure, experience with evocative scene-setting and dreamy atmosphere.",
        "There is a vengeance motif that is worked out in a way that is both emotionally satisfying and completely unbelievable.",
        "As repellent and repellently opportunistic a piece of work as the various shock-horror provocations (The Isle, The Coast Guard) that helped to launch this worrisome career (Kim Ki-Duk)."

At first, the male lead struck me as a metaphorical zombie who breaks into strangers' homes because he misses the routine of domestic life, and the woman he indoctrinates in his world of non-crime, pretends to have the same catalepsy as a means of escape from her abusive marriage. But then he's incarcerated, and in his cell, the man seems to change from a material being into something more incorporeal, which brings to mind a similar jail-cell transformation in \"Lost Highway\", when Bill Pullman inexplicably turns into Balthazar Getty. Ki-Duk Kim has the same \"don't explain a thing\" ethos as David Lynch, which will enthrall and frustrate moviegoers in equal numbers. We wait for the big revelation, a definitive answer to explain all of \"3-Iron('s)\" enigmas, like \"The Sixth Sense\", but the final frame leaves us with more questions.",

It has an interesting story, fresh concept, immersive development, is enjoyable poetic and has fascinating ideas. I just watched it with a friend in the cinema a long time ago because he recommend the movie and said it sounded interesting with a little bit craziness. Today I would have done some research but back then I did watch it without knowing anything about the movie except being made in Korea. Side note: I know this movie as Bin-Jip not as 3-Iron. It is described as romantic drama but I see barley the drama aspect. It can be alternatively described as slice of life of a loner that turns into a character development or heroes journey. Tae-Suk is a loner who aimlessly drives around on his motorbike and in life. He breaks into homes where the owners are out of town by lockpicking. He is testing that the owners are out of town with fliers from restaurants. If they were not removed in a timely manner the owners are out of town. However while he lives in the homes he is no burglar. He does not steal, washes clothes, cleaned the homes and repairs broken equipment. The story starts when he meets the model Sun-Hwa in one of the homes he broke in. I end with the set up. I say the story was unlike anything I expected. It won me over, was enjoyable and I cared for the characters (= Hallmarks of good story telling). There will be twists and character development. One of the final developments from Tae-Suk can be seen as a negative by others. However for me it made the movie better, more remarkable and fascinating. I and my friends love the idea. Lets say it has elements that can be used in a fairy tale too without being much out of place in reality. I want to praise the director and writer Kim Ki-Duk for this. He is great in what he does and definitely deserves more recognition. Now to the good cast. Lee Hyun-Kyoon is a fantastic Tae-Suk. He works without words as silent protagonist. Alone his mimic and body language is far better than a lot of other actors that have dialogues. It never feels out of place and delivers everything. Should probably include this as example for the \u201cShow not tell\u201d rule in movies. Then here is Lee Seung-Yeon as Sun-Hwa. She does an amazing job in a difficult role. I praise her for this great performance as a weaker performance had weaken the movie too. Kwon Hyuk-Ho ins Min-Gyu who is a rich businessman and husband of Sun-Hwa. He is great to in the love to hate category. I truly enjoyed him. The other characters have smaller roles but enhance the experience and I will name Ju Jin-Mo here as he does a lot in a smaller role. The visuals and sets are good and help to deliver the atmosphere. As a sidenote: I think the movie is named 3-Iron because Tae-Suk uses a golf club and trains by binding a golf ball to a tree for training his hits. Overall this is a hidden gem and movie I recommend to anyone who likes something different that is entertaining, poetic and a modern fairy tale without getting far into fantasy territory.",
