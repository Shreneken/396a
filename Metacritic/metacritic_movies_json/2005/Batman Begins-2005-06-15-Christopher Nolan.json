    "critic_reviews": [
        "For the first time since \"X-Men,\" I was on the edge of my seat anticipating a sequel, wondering who'd play the Joker and how quickly Nolan - it must be Nolan! - can bring the next chapter of this story to the screen.",
        "This is the Batman movie I've been waiting for; more correctly, this is the movie I did not realize I was waiting for, because I didn't realize that more emphasis on story and character and less emphasis on high-tech action was just what was needed. The movie works dramatically in addition to being an entertainment. There's something to it.",
        "A great movie, period. It's great because it's so real.",
        "A rousing, reverent, often brilliant re-creation of a seminal comics character, Batman Begins proves Batman is at home in the 21st century as he was in the 20th.",
        "A confidently original, engrossing interpretation.",
        "Technically, the film is consistently impressive. It creates a grimly gothic vision of a crime-ridden and depression-ravaged Gotham City, a dandy pair of chase sequences involving the new generation Batmobile and a range of innovative visual effects.",
        "It's witty, gripping good fun.",
        "For Christopher Nolan to turn Batman Begins into such a smart, gritty, brooding, visceral experience is astonishing. Truly, Batman does begin again.",
        "A carefully thought out and consummately well-made piece of work, a serious comic-book adaptation that is driven by story, psychology and reality, not special effects.",
        "Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director who takes his material seriously and to a star who shoulders that seriousness with ease.",
        "Batman Begins emerges from the darkness and leaves a powerful, lasting impression.",
        "The action scenes are, for the most part, kinetic and exciting - things that have rarely been true of fights and chases in the superhero's previous incarnations.",
        "Significantly grittier than previous Bat-beginnings, this finds new things to do with, and say about, a character who's been around since 1938.",
        "Of course, a Batman movie is nothing without a Bruce Wayne, and, by a mile, Bale is the best of a lot that has ranged from the square-jawed slapstick of Adam West to the more dedbonair stylings of Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney.",
        "Not just one of the best \"comic book\" movies ever made, but also one of the best films of the year.",
        "At times it feels almost too busy with plotting. There's so much going on, and so much to take in, that it leaves you winded. But that's origin stories for you. No one ever said setting up a savior would be simple.",
        "The buildup is steadily engrossing. That's because Nolan keeps the emphasis on character, not gadgets. Gotham looks lived in, not art-directed.",
        "In Batman Begins, Christian Bale gives us the best Bruce Wayne that has ever graced the screen.",
        "Nolan is a fascinating, offbeat choice for a huge movie franchise such as this. Just as Bale turns Batman into a near-tragic obsessive -- a Scarlet Pimpernel with the soul of a Hamlet and Monte Cristo -- Nolan turns Batman Begins into something much closer to Miller's \"Dark Knight\" interpretation.",
        "What you get out of Batman Begins depends on what you bring to it. It is the most faithful to the origins of the comic strip and it sets up a series very different from the four made by Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher between 1989 and 1997.",
        "Batman Begins is a mature take on material often relegated to the kiddie file, and it's simply the latest proof that, when treated properly, comic books are a viable art form for all ages. Bring on the sequel.",
        "Best of all, there's just the pleasure of seeing something that's both fantastic to the eye and emotionally dimensional. This is how to make action movies.",
        "Ambitious, well made but not exactly rousing.",
        "The movie is satisfying, though -- at least by the standards of that depressing phenomenon, the superhero \"franchise.\"",
        "A mostly successful attempt to resuscitate a series soiled by silliness, sloppiness and Joel Schumacher.",
        "All of the story is so absurdly humourless that it is dramatically inert, as if Nolan had decided the only way to make the Batman character more substantial was to put weights on his wings.",
        "The early going -- say, an hour -- is spent in a fatigued daze. A few powerful jabs eventually punch things up.",
        "Burton gives us SuperDude; Nolan gives us Sir Subdued.",
        "Not bad for summer jollies, au contraire, but -- \"Holy Raised Bar, Batman!\" -- let's pray that the next installment measures up to the sequel summits of \"Spider-Man 2\" and \"X2.\"",
        "Nolan and his co-screenwriter David Goyer can only press the big buttons so hard\u2014it's still an old-school superhero summer movie, the plotting tortuous, the characters relegated to one-scene-one-emotion simplicity, the digitized action a never ending club mix of chases and mano a manos.",
        "The result is handsome and logical, but missing the spark that would make it thrilling.",
        "Begins, at two-hours-plus, is a nonstarter.",
        "The young Welsh-born actor Christian Bale is a serious fellow, but the most interesting thing about him--a glinting sense of superiority--gets erased by the dull earnestness of the screenplay, and the filmmakers haven't developed an adequate villain for him to go up against.",
        "Nolan's effort is not dishonorable, but what it needs, and doesn't have, is a Joker in the deck--some antic human antimatter to give it the giddy lift of perversity that a bunch of impersonal explosions, no matter how well managed, can't supply.",
        "Batman Begins is obvious from the get-go - and almost no fun.",
        "A good as the performances are, and as dutiful as Nolan has been in preserving the Kane legacy in Batman Begins, there's something joyless about the enterprise.",
        "There are strong turns by Michael Caine as Alfred the butler and Tom Wilkinson as a ruthless crime boss.",
        "Delivers enough action to please Saturday-night crowds, if not the surreal wit that made the first two \"Batman\" movies, directed by Tim Burton, so entertaining.",
        "Needs much more energy and kinetic flow -- less dolor and more dolomite.",
        "Even if there were a great movie here, it would have been undermined by two lead actors who are barely even there, asked to deliver lines they can't handle: Bale, playing the Batman with clipped wings, and Katie Holmes as an assistant district attorney who doesn't have the gravitas to pass as an intern. Come back, Alicia Silverstone; all is forgiven."

The film's creator figured rightly that the only way to revive the franchise was to start all over again by retelling the legend of Batman's origins. Christian Bale is the first convincing Bruce Wayne/Batman for me. In \"Begins\", Bruce spends seven years traveling the world studying criminals and hanging out with criminals in prisons in search of revenge for the death of his wealthy parents at the hands of a homeless mugger. Along the way he meets Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) and is taken in by a mysterious group of vigilantes known as the League of Shadows. Wayne eventually comes to reject the League's apocalyptic and immoral methods of cleansing the world of corruption and criminality. After rejecting the League's apocalyptic methods, Bruce creates the \"Batman\" crime fighting character. In the end, Bruce must successfully confront the League's plan to destroy Gotham in order for his \"Batman\" character to succeed in his mission to save his home city from corruption and crime. Bruce pretends to be a billionaire playboy in public as a front for not drawing any attention to who he really is after hours. This is incredibly disappointing to Bruce's love interest, idealistic junior DA Rachel Dawes (Who I think is played quite well by the much hated Katie Holmes). Michael Cayne is a suitable Alfred and seems to be popular with fans in the role. The best supporting character is Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), the Wayne Enterprises scientific genius who has the knowledge and possession of everything Bruce needs to become Batman. I really love it when Bruce sees \"The Tumbler\", a.k.a. the future Batmobile, an experimental military vehicle, and Fox seriously says to him \"Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that\". The writers of the film obviously did that line for laughs and it works every time for me. Near the end when Alfred says to Bruce that it might be time to do some more work on the foundations of Wayne manner, particularly in the area of the Bat Cave, I'm left wanting to see what happens afterward. I hope we see at least a couple more \"Batman\" films with Bale et al.",

Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and even Katie Holmes is amazing in this movie.

Why did I not see this in the theaters? Caine and Freeman firmly cement their personas, delivering spot-on performances, Gary Oldman proves that he can quite simply out-character act anybody in the industry, and Bale, in a stunning turn -around physically from The Machinst, IS Bruce Wayne (P.S.: watch The Machinist. Bale reportedly ate an apple and a single can of tuna (while working out incessantly) to capture the physicality of the role. He then promptly assured producers that he could play the part in Batman Begins, and then proceeded to bulk out in SIX WEEKS . Neeson turns in an admirable peformance, and Holmes seems out of her element, but overall, this is the definative origin story which renders the previous Burton/Bruckheimer movies quaint, more or (VERY) less watchable, but utterly irrelevant. The 60's T.V. show was the coloring book, the previous franchise was the high school book report, and we now have the fully developed master's thesis of how a billionaire with a grudge and a horrible childhood trauma could resort to, and be facilitated in, swooping about Gotham, scaring the s*** out of criminals and audiences alike. I usually balk at the set-up for the inevitable next movie, but I actually cheered when Oldman's Gordon turned over the playing card... Kudos!!!",

By using his Memento-style Non-linear storytelling techniques, beautiful cinematography, and insanely witty and provocative dialogue, Nolan created the most captivating superhero yarn to date. Christian Bale is almost objectively the best Batman actor. I've never seen any of the other Batman actors put as much effort into this role as Bale has. He really, and truly lifted this role off the proverbial page and he successfully managed to encapsulate the Batman/Bruce Wayne that Bob Kane and Bill Finger created. Every other actor in this movie is fantastic as well. Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman all comprise the amazing supporting cast. On a personal note, the film also possesses has one of my favorite scores too. Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard really did something out of the box for this film, but they also did something quite beautiful and appropriate. Overall, this movie is one of the most influential movies I have ever seen. It managed to portray every aspect of Batman's origin to a tee. Truly, a masterpiece.",

Kudos to the Nolan brothers for a fabulous script and direction. The score kept the tempo running. Even given the breakneck pace, the main character developed constantly.

Sadly, I cannot say the same about the sequels. This one had the background, build-up, character development and action in the right proportions. It felt like a movie that was about Batman. The Dark Knight felt like it was about Joker. Rises concerned itself with uprisings and counter uprisings.

I was really confused when I saw it at first when I was younger but when I watch it today, I have so much more respect for it. Christopher Nolan took so much inspiration from comics like Batman: Year One and he incorporated that in this movie. He didn't straight up adapt one single comic book, he took bits and parts from a ton of batman comic books and combined it into one. And if you really pay attention, they mention Victor Zsasz and Commissioner Loeb who were both minor characters in the Batman universe. It was great to hear them mentioned in this movie and other Dark Knight movies. It really showed how much respect and trust I have for Christopher Nolan. He really does know exactly what he is doing and wants with these movies. In the movie, I really liked how stealthy Batman was when he was out fighting crime. It made sense because Batman is a very dark and stealthy character so it was actually really intense to see him take down all of these henchman at once. It was surprise because it actually reminded me of such movies like Alien because of how suspenseful it was. When one of the henchman looks up and he sees  batman literally pounce on him is a lot like how the Alien in Alien took down the people on the ship. Also, a great choice for a villain. Since the scarecrow was a bit of an unconventional villain for batman, it had a lot of people scratching their heads but it was a great choice. In this movie, Bruce Wayne was dealing with his fear of bats so the scarecrow a huge challenge because he had to overcome his fears in order to defeat the scarecrow. It was a very clever choice for a villain and I really enjoyed it. If you haven't seen Batman Begins then you are missing out. It is a very rare film that can stand alone as a single movie without any sequels. But those other movies are pretty great too but I'm not talking about that.",

The fights which Batman has throughout this movie are pretty good and most of them hold up pretty well for a 2005 movie I must say, theres the odd bit of cgi which doesn't hold up during a later fight but apart from that they're pretty fun to watch. Bruce Wayne and Alfred (Michael Caine) have some really good chemistry with each other when they're on set together which is really good. Finally, Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) is a really good villain in this movie some of the effects can be quite mixed in my opinion, some of them are quite good and some of them are quite outdated. Almost forgetting to mention, Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) he's also really good in this movie and to be totally honest most of the actors/actress do an amazing job in this movie. Overall, it's an amazing action packed movie with some brilliant fight scenes with an amazing story and characters, worth the watch.",

This movie redefined Batman for a new generation, and it largely hit all the marks. Christian Bale is great as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Michael Caine is an EXCELLENT choice for Alfred! As a comic book enthusiast, I was a little upset with the combination of Ducard and Ra's, but I can appreciate the attempted fake-out by the filmmaker of the \"friend turned foe\" at the end. I also love Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow. He truly embodies Dr. Crane and plays the role to a tee. All in all, it was time for Batman to embrace being a DARK Knight after having some pretty campy portrayals in the 90s. He finally felt like the character the comics created.My one complaint is a complaint I have with most Batman origin movies, and that is the attempted connection of the Wayne's murder to the main villain. Let Joe Chill just be another nameless/faceless bad guy! Batman doesn't have to have some personal vendetta that traces back to that one incident for the villain to mean something. Ra's Al Ghul is menacing enough, especially had they really played up the immortality card. Still, I love this movie and love how it still holds up 15 years later!",

Then came Joel Schumacher with his campy and unintentionally hilarious (but damn right awful) 'Batman Forever' (1995) and the atrocious 'Batman and Robin' (1997) where fans reacted negatively. It's easy to understand why.\r Here, Christopher Nolan decides to polish things up with Christian Bale in the title role of Bruce Wayne aka \"Batman\". We get a glimpse of his childhood and origins as we learn that he has a huge fear of Bats, his loving parents then also decide to take him to the theater and that's where his parents are shot by a thug.\r Young Bruce feels responsible for his parents' death and is left to live with Alfred, the butler (Michael Caine). Wayne, years later, goes off to train to become some sort of assassin as Ra'as Al Ghul (Liam Neeson) teaches him how to fight.\r We get a lot of exposition and development to see how Batman becomes...Batman. Katie Holmes plays Rachel Dawes, Bruce's love interest. Holmes' performance does bother me a little in this movie and it's understandable as to how she landed a Razzie Award nomination for \"Worst Supporting Actress\".\r Cillian Murphy plays the Scarecrow, we get some horrifying images of when he makes his victims hallucinate and cause them to act up.\r 'Batman Begins' is a reboot worth waiting for, it is darker, and less campy than the previous installments. Christian Bale plays a marvelous Bruce Wayne/Batman, the rest of the cast, including; Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman also commit to their performances. The standards for comic book movies has risen since this movie was released, and it's hard to see any other Batman movie made this perfect.\r If you love dark and gritty movies, with splendid action and only the occasional joke here and there...then this movie is for you. It blends all these sub-genres very well and makes for a better-than-your-average comic book movie, I bet even non-comic book fans will love this movie as much as we do.",

It features excellent acting, perfectly paced writing, and a thoroughly satisfying adaptation of the character.\rEven if it didn't garner the success that it has, this movie could have gone very far on merit of its cast alone.  Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox, Michael Caine's Alfred, and Liam Neeson's Ras al Ghul, are all perfect representations of their comic counterparts, and are highly entertaining.  Bale plays a great Bruce Wayne, naive, and disillusioned at first, and confident and motivated later on in the film.  And that raspy voice of his; well, that's just cool.\rNolan wrote this movie perfectly.  Batman is really not even a character, until midway through the second act.  Bruce Wayne undergoes a journey around the world, seeking to understand criminality, and training with the league of assassins where he comes to understand combat, and stealth tactics.  The batsuit is explained also through a series of technological innovations that happened to be too expensive for mass production.  Although this is a Batman movie, it is really a story about fear.  The movie's villain Scarecrow seeks to control others with fear, and Batman uses his own fear of bats, to fight back against the injustices of the underworld.\rThe movie transcends the superhero genre.  The action sequences, though immensely gratifying are not  the film's focal point and are used to amplify the story's message.  Batman begins is the first movie to truly understand what batman is about.  It is about a man, who's life is plagued by fear; a man who has fallen down in life, time and time again, and who finally finds the courage to face his fear, and save his city.",
