  "critic_reviews": [
    "It's a low-key, subtly inspirational drama that builds its charm slowly but surely.",
    "Rarely do movies portray the elderly with such admiration and respect.",
    "Fast, funny, big-hearted.",
    "This film would be better if it wasn't so slick. Still, parts of it are enjoyably shaggy, and Hopkins is very endearing.",
    "Both handmade and souped-up, it beautifully renders two types of camaraderie: the bonds among eccentrics and the fellowship of speed.",
    "A wonderfully uplifting and charming biopic that's sure to win over all but the most mean-spirited. And the motorbike races really rocket, too.",
    "Does what it sets out to do: educates about a mostly unknown historical figure (without doctoring the facts too much), entertains, and uplifts.",
    "Hopkins' larger-than-life performance as the crusty and crafty Burt rivets your attention for two solid hours in this most entertaining labor of love.",
    "Whether he'll achieve his goal of setting the world land-speed record for motorcycles is never in doubt, of course, but getting to a film's climactic scene has rarely been more fun.",
    "This is one of Anthony Hopkins' most endearing, least showy performances.",
    "The World's Fastest Indian might be the world's worst title for a charming, slice-of-life biopic.",
    "All the hammy acting and meandering storytelling in the world can't drown the essential appeal of the story.",
    "A sweet, watchable little film.",
    "It's giving nothing away to say that Munro makes it to Bonneville, and breaks the record - which apparently still stands - on his two-wheel contraption.",
    "Hopkins' performance flat-out works.",
    "Sometimes shticky biopic overcomes its cornball conventionality to become a genial entertainment, thanks to Anthony Hopkins' exceptionally engaging performance.",
    "The result is a film as tenacious, peculiar, and likable as Burt Munro himself.",
    "Hopkins delivers such a warm, winning performance that it's hard not to be won over by his loopy charm and monomaniacal passion. The film is about a man whose need for speed takes on an existential and spiritual dimension, but it's precisely its rambling, meandering, unhurried affability that makes it such a low-key pleasure.",
    "This is a film that wears a smile button on its sleeve along with its happy heart. It believes that most people are absolutely wonderful, and it is well enough made so that a dusting of that dogged optimism is bound to rub off on you.",
    "Based on the real-life exploits of Munro, it's a boilerplate fish-out-of-water/road trip/underdog sports movie -- but it's a heck of a ride with Hopkins leading the way.",
    "A warm, spacious road movie with a stirring sense of the wide-open landscapes of the American West.",
    "This compelling fact-based story is his (Roger Donaldson) best effort in years.",
    "The cockeyed devotion with which writer-director Roger Donaldson dramatizes the story of New Zealand motorcycle legend Burt Munro and his classic 1920 bike in The World's Fastest Indian is in direct proportion to the cockeyed devotion with which Munro himself pursued his lifetime goal of setting a land-speed record at Bonneville Flats, Utah.",
    "All one needs to know about Burt Munro, the real-life New Zealand codger and Indian motorcycle enthusiast who in 1967 set a land speed record that still stands today, comes midway through this unabashedly sentimental wall of schmaltz.",
    "The film is at its best in Utah, both because in David Gribble's exhilarating cinematography we finally get to feel the full power and intoxication of the sport.",
    "I recommend it to anyone who needs proof that people past 60 have dreams, skills and/or sex lives.",
    "The World's Fastest Indian may be the world's slowest movie.",
    "Slogs pokily along and never quite picks up speed.",
    "Even a nice chianti couldn't help you wash down this lump of tear-jerking twaddle.",
    "The World's Fastest Indian is not likely to be regarded as some kind of masterpiece--far from it--but Hopkins once more keeps our ears open and our eyes fixed on the screen.",
    "As the movie's tag line has it, it's based on a hell of a story. Too bad they didn't just tell it."

But when Munro triumphs in the Beehive State, the magnitude of his achievement outweighs Hopkins' old man schtick. In \"The World's Fastest Indian\", we have an eternity to ponder if it's offensive to name a motorcycle after a Native-American. Munro hates smoking, yet he gives an ashtray to a tribal chief as a gift. Along his journey to Utah, we learn he's kind to transgendered minorities and doesn't need viagra(including Ladd, who seems to be playing Flo in retirement). He's also long-winded(in which the other characters stand around and let Hopkins \"Act!\"). It's not until his fellow land-speed enthusiasts rhapsodize about his courage and pluck do we fully engage with Munro's story. As Jim Moffet, Christopher Lawford gives the key performance.",

      "content": "Writer-director Roger Donaldson's hugely affectionate, admiring portrait of New Zealand folk hero Burt Munro (Anthony Hopkins), a senior citizen who follows his dream to set the motorcycle land speed record at the Bonneville (Utah) Writer-director Roger Donaldson's hugely affectionate, admiring portrait of New Zealand folk hero Burt Munro (Anthony Hopkins), a senior citizen who follows his dream to set the motorcycle land speed record at the Bonneville (Utah) Flats, zooms along a very simple path. Munro charms New Zealand neighbors (including the ones next door whom he normally annoys with his noisy midnight tune-ups and unkempt lawn). Munro travels to USA and charms everyone he meets. (Well, almost everyone.) Munro makes it to Bonneville and charms all the other racers. Munro...well, you get my drift, but chances are excellent that while you're actually watching the movie, you either won't notice how prdictable much of it is or you'll be smiling too much to care. Transport Rocky Balboa to the other side of the globe, set the time machine back to the early 1960s, saddle him with a neverending series of financial obstacles and health problems (to say nothing of the title vehicle, a 1920 model kept alive and roaring with equal amounts of tinkering and TLC), and you've got this ceaselessly delightful tribute to Munro's can-do spirit. It's a real comeback for Donaldson, Munro's talented countryman who, after doing the powerful, promising domestic drama Smash Palace in his homeland, traveled stateside and, following a few respectable productions like The Bounty (an account of the famous mutiny featuring Hopkins' evenhanded, everyone-has-his-reasons interpretation of the notorious Captain Bligh) sunk deeper and deeper into the mire, churning out some of the worst junk of the 1980s and 90s (Cocktail, White Sands, the original Species and the Basinger-Baldwin remake of Sam Peckinpah's The Getaway). His Bay of Pigs historical drama Thirteen Days was a few steps up (even if it DID imply that Kevin Costner solved the whole Cuban missile crisis by himself, with maybe a little help from President John F. Kennedy), but Donaldson's deep and obvious love for his subject here appears to have bought him his soul back. After recently seeing Transamerica I complained that the road movie was, for the most part, an overused, moribund genre that needs to be gently put to rest...but Donaldson has made me eat my words. Munro's travels from Los Angeles to Utah work delightfully because Donaldson doesn't overplay his hand (even with the passenger who's involved in a new military adventure in a place called Vietnam)...he just tells the story of a very nice man who meets a lot of different people and brings out THEIR internal niceness. Of course, it helps to build your movie around such an engaging central character whose effect on others is so readily understandable: Munro is a blissfully uncomplicated soul who's so comfortable within his own skin (it's mentioned repeatedly that he neither smokes nor drinks, but then he doesn't NEED to) that he effortlessly breaks down other people's defenses. (In more ways than one, too: he gets two extremely attractive older women into bed--or more probably, they get HIM into bed--and I strongly suspect that some of the younger ladies at Bonneville would've happily given him a go if they hadn't had husbands or boyfriends around.) Although not as prolific a year for screen biographies as 2004 was, 2005 certainly had its share of good ones: I'm as big a fan of Walk the Line and Good Night, and Good Luck as most (and slightly less of one on Capote, a somewhat sluggishly directed film powered mostly by spectacular performances), but the two that resonated the most with me--now and I'm sure years from now, too--were The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio, about 1950s housewife and contest winner Evelyn Ryan, who juggles a houseful of kids and a reprobate husband, and this. I'm completely convinced that both movies, dealing as they do with hugely appealing, plucky and uncomplicated individuals who repeatedly beat the odds with great mental toughness, would've been tremendous word-of-mouth populist hits (and garnered Hopkins and Prize Winner star Julianne Moore Oscar nominations that I thought they were completely robbed of) if the producers had only done the Oprah circuit a la My Big Fat Greek wedding rather than relegated them to big-city arthouses. (Nearly everyone I know who saw either or both films loved them.) Then again, maybe all those Zig Ziglar and Tony Robbins motivational tapes I listened to as part of my sales job ten years ago finally kicked in!",

It is about chasing a dream and it is never too late to do that so. Based on the story of a New Zealand motorcyclist Burt Munro. After spending 25 years to build a faster motorbike in the down under, now a very old Munro travel halfway across the earth to Bonneville speedway in the US to set a record. So what's the remaining of the tale reveals is that does his dream becomes reality or not.\r Awesome performance by Anthony Hopkins, but in some parts I was distracted by his fake Kiwi accent. Overall, not bad with his effort, he achieved the goal conveniently. It is one of the best road movie that directed by the 'Species' filmmaker. The 120 minutes was too short, but well covered story with inclusion of messages like anti smoking and alcohol consumption.\r It is a decade old film, never too late to watch a fine film like this, but inside I feel regret for the delay. I had no idea about the storyline. I thought it might be about Indians and then thought American Indians, but realised only while watching it that it is about a motorbike called Indian. It is surely a good family movie, especially if there is a motorbike maniac in the house. Highly recommended by me.\r 9/10",

It seems that everyone who meets Burt becomes enamoured with him, which makes you want him to do well. Its a pretty slow movie really but its funny and touching/sentimental throughout and I wouldn't say that its too boring but don't expect it to be full of fast paced racing footage, its more about the man himself, his journey across the US and the people he meets.Anthony Hopkins is well cast in his role of Burt. He certainly portrays him as a kind, loveable old guy with a biy of a glint in his eye. Its sad to see when his health problems flare up, it makes him more determined to complete his task and make everyone he's met proud, I think. The music score is quite emotive and adds to the film well, not being too overly powerful or really unmemorable either. There are some nice landscape scenes at times and otherwise the camerawork is quite good, especially during the racing scenes.I'm sure that anyone who does race would be able to relate, at least in part, to Burt, when he talks about the thrill of racing and shows a young boy fan of his, back at home in New Zealand, his photo album and shows that his life has been all about racing, for the last forty years or so.I thought that it was quite a good family type movie, really I have no complaints about it at all, other than that some may think it doesn't show enough racing scenes perhaps but I certainly enjoyed it. This, I felt, is a very good movie, one thats pretty much safe for all the family to watch. Hopkins does very well as Burt and in general I feel the movie was very well made, with good camerawork and musical score and an interesting story based on a true story, what more could you want? this movie I definitely recommend.",
