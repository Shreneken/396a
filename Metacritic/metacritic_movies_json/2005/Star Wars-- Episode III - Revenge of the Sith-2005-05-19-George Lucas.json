  "critic_reviews": [
    "All the \"Star Wars\" movies will continue to entertain us for many years to come. They were grand fun, and this last one's a corker.",
    "A pop masterpiece.",
    "The movie grabs us from its heart-pounding opening sequence and pulls us inexorably along its trajectory with the grip of the last gruesome act of a Greek tragedy. Its fascination is not what happens but HOW it happens.",
    "The darkest, most operatic, and technologically richest \"Star Wars\" movie to date, \"Sith\" is grim, stirring entertainment and a nearly complete vindication of everything its creator has been saying for six years about where the series was heading and what its final shape would be.",
    "The final episode of George Lucas' cinematic epic \"Star Wars\" ends the six-movie series on such a high note that one feels like yelling out, \"Rewind!\" Yes, rewind through more than 13 hours of bravery, treachery, new worlds, odd creatures and human frailty.",
    "Emerges as the best in the overall series since \"The Empire Strikes Back.\"",
    "This is by far the best film in the more recent trilogy, and also the best of the four episodes Mr. Lucas has directed. That's right (and my inner 11-year-old shudders as I type this): it's better than \"Star Wars.\"",
    "For my generation, Revenge of the Sith is a brilliant consummation to a promise made a long time ago, far, far away, in a galaxy called 1977.",
    "Lucas is a major figure, and Revenge of the Sith may be some kind of historic achievement -- the first movie in which it is fully impossible to tell where flesh ends and digital paint begins.",
    "Only now can we truly step back and admire the full tapestry that it has taken George Lucas and his ILM wizards nearly three decades to weave.",
    "Once Palpatine's machinations set the cogs in motion for the creation of Vader, and the Clone Wars start getting bloody, Sith commences to cook in a way that no Star Wars movie has since \"Empire.\"",
    "Even for non-fans, Revenge of the Sith is engrossing, and fans of the series will likely be over the moon -- and into another galaxy -- with this film.",
    "Episode III has more action per square minute, I'd guess, than any of the previous five movies, and it is spectacular. The special effects are more sophisticated than in the earlier movies, of course, but not necessarily more effective.",
    "The real deal, an often awkward but nonetheless terrifically compelling high-stakes human drama.",
    "Star Wars really does begin here.",
    "Lucas manages to turn the audience's familiarity to his advantage: like a jigsaw puzzle whose final form has always been known, the fun is in discovering how the last pieces fit.",
    "Far and away the best of the Star Wars prequels (tough chore, that) and also holds its own with the hallowed films of the original trilogy.",
    "Arguably the darkest episode in the entire series (and the first to carry a PG-13 rating) the visually stunning \"Sith\" is also the fastest-paced and most accessible.",
    "For all its doom and gloom, Revenge of the Sith turns out to have a happy ending after all, giving Star Wars the send-off it deserves.",
    "On the action-adventure level it's a sure-fire delight for fans, a punchy entertainment for average sci-fi buffs, and a colorful rocket-ride for moviegoers who just want a good time on Saturday night.",
    "The most energetic of the prequels, the only one at all worth watching. But that doesn't mean it is without the weaknesses that scuttled its pair of predecessors. Quite the contrary.",
    "The battle sequences and lightsaber battles are gripping, and for every scene that doesn't deliver the goods, there's another that hums with surprising intensity.",
    "Though Sith finally finds some life in the old saga, was it worth it in the end? Did we have to go through all that to get back where we began?",
    "Two prequels' worth of scene setting pays off in the politically resonant Revenge of the Sith.",
    "The one figure in Revenge of the Sith who taps the true spirit of Star Wars is Ewan McGregor: With his beautiful light, clipped delivery, he plays Alec Guinness' playfulness, making Obi-Wan a marvel of benevolent moxie.",
    "A vast improvement over the previous two outings, but still and all, it's no \"Star Wars.\"",
    "And still the dialogue is astonishingly feeble, the acting unforgivably wooden. To paraphrase Yoda, the only creature with ­truly human dimensions ever since Harrison Ford's cowboy-mechanic Han Solo departed the galaxy: Bored I am.",
    "Though it starts slowly, it lumbers toward greatness in the last third and restores him [Lucas] briefly to the top of his class.",
    "What a shock when George Lucas finds his footing and the saga once again takes hold.",
    "Until the last half-hour, when Lucas actually does establish a emotional connection between the landmark he created in 1977 and the prequel investment portfolio he laid out in 1999, the movie is one spectacularly designed letdown after another.",
    "Even setting aside the clumsy inconsistency of its interior logic, Sith is an underachievement of escapist entertainment.",
    "Lucas is a brilliant technician but a poor philosopher, and his lurchingly thought-out rendering of futuristic politics prevents the entire series from achieving the greatness to which it aspires. (You don’t make anything this big, for this long, without aiming for the planet Masterpiece.)",
    "For the casual viewer who feels like maybe all the Sith hoopla is worth checking out, well, it's like tuning in to the season finale of \"24\" without having watched a minute of its lead-up episodes.",
    "The movie drags.",
    "The greatest story ever has finally been told. Or, if you prefer, the damn thing has come to its merciful end.",
    "Is it enough to make us like a thing we used to love? For most, that rekindling of an old flame will be good enough.",
    "Revenge was supposed to be the one that really socked it to us, about Anakin's almost biblical fall from grace. But the movie never rises to its powerful occasion.",
    "I suspect this picture is pretty close to what fans were hoping for, and for their sake, I'm glad it's markedly better than the two that preceded it.  But Revenge of the Sith is still crap.",
    "The general opinion of Revenge of the Sith seems to be that it marks a distinct improvement on the last two episodes, \"The Phantom Menace\" and \"Attack of the Clones.\" True, but only in the same way that dying from natural causes is preferable to crucifixion."

Now i understand that episodes I and II weren't up to snuff, to put it softly, but, to say that the second trilogy had little or no plot or character development, is to discredit yourself of all intelligence. Anakin begins in epsiode one as a boy, wanting to do good. As he gets older, he becomes disillusioned with how the jedi council is treating him; he thinks he deserves more, and instead of keeping him from turing, they only make it worse. There is no need for breaking ANakin, because he is already broken. He wants his love to survive, but he knows she might not. Since he trusts Palpatine, he belives in his words, that there may be a way to save her. He's not bad, his misguided, and to say that is not true plot or character development, is just crazy!",

Of all the Star Wars pictures, this is the only one with any serious emotional resonance for me. In the I have seen all the Star Wars pictures(hey, I'm from North America, folks) even though I'm not particularly a Star Wars buff. Of all the Star Wars pictures, this is the only one with any serious emotional resonance for me. In the all the early Star Wars pictures, George Lucas was trying to recapture the old Flash Gordon serials in high tech terms with an overlay of New Age mysticism. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. This is the only movie, to be blunt, where I think George Lucas is doing some serious thinking. He's contemplating why someone might turn to (if one might use an old-fashioned term here) evil. This gives the whole thing a gravitas that the rest of the series simply doesn't have. While I suppose this film gives the viewer (to use a degraded bit of modern-day post-modern jargon) closure in respect to the character of Darth Vader, and the film ties up various plot and thematic odds and ends, it cuts much deeper. George, who has clearly read Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\", depicts how Anakin Skywalker's outer deformity grows out of his inner deformity. And George's perceptions here are on a higher level than the rest of the films. He appreciates that Evil (if, again, I may use the term) is often a strange combination of bad intentions and good intentions. That is a very 21st century perception, miles away from the original \"Star Wars.\" And, surprisingly, there is even some wit here. At one point, a character arrives at a planet, proclaiming,'I have come in regards to the War.\" The alien replies,\"There is no War here. Perhaps you brought one with you?\" Ho, ho! Leave aside the whole question of highbrow and lowbrow. This is a great shaft of wit, period. If George had only written this one line, he'd deserve to live forever. This is, figuratively and literally, the darkest Star Wars picture and quite rightly so. The sadness and the sense of dark inevitability are oddly haunting in their way here. It is said that Japanese popular culture is obsessed with the Star Wars mythos. This is the film, in my opinion, that justifies the fascinationg. If I had to have only one Star Wars picture, this would be it. Greg Cameron, Surrey, B.C., Canada.",

Mustafar is one of the most unique planets in the saga, being a volcanic hotbed of fire, not only setting the stage of the final battle, but representing the psychological state of one of the main characters. The opening sequence is amazing; I felt like I was being whisked through a massive space battle-this was an amazing feeling. The additional CGI action sequences also look very good. Complimenting these battles are 5 lightsaber duels-the most in an individual Star Wars episode. Each features its own intriguing and interesting aspects, but, of course, the most iconic is the duel between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader on Mustafar. The duel's combatants are both lightning fast-in fact, the duelists are the fastest in lightsaber use than any other duel in the saga-not only that, but the duel takes place in the most hazardous environment, which increases the tension. The emotional impact of the duel cannot be overstated; best friends/brothers fighting each other is undeniably a tragedy. Speaking of which, Anakin is the tragic/fallen hero in the film, while Palpatine is a devious mastermind who acts as a twisted father figure to Anakin. Obi-Wan, meanwhile, completes his transition from a High Jedi General-a commander in the Grand Army of the Republic, and a Jedi Master-to a hermit on Tatooine. Finally, the children of Anakin and Padmé are born, symbolizing the birth of hope. George Lucas' writing is still very good; the scene where Palpatine declares himself Galactic Emperor is one of the most chilling moments ever in a non-horror movie. The interactions between characters are well-done, and the dialogue makes sense, in those scenes. Episode III is the most tragic film of the saga-that is undeniable. The feeling of impending doom during the first half of the film is nearly palpable. When the second half begins, so does all the tragedy. I really felt for the 3 main characters as their worlds came undone around them, especially Anakin-during the entire prequel trilogy, he endures so much hardship and loss; he, in my opinion, is one of the most tragic protagonists in film history. Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is an immensely satisfying conclusion to the prequel trilogy-the first half of the Star Wars saga-and perfectly sets up the original trilogy.

The romance scenes are a lot better and don’t feel forced. The plot is consistent, face paced, and entertaining. Unlike in Attack of the Clones, I never felt bored watching this movie. It’s full of action, suspense, and emotions.Watching how the Republic fell and Anakin’s turn to the dark side were amazing and finally gave context to the OT. Ian McDiarmid is amazing as Palpatine, especially in scenes like Order 66 and the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise. Hayden Christensen got a lot better and portrays Anakin excellently as a young adult confused with emotions he has been forced to hold back until they finally erupt inside of him and fuel his turn to darkness. Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman are gems as usual. The scene between Obi Wan and Anakin on Mustafar has to be one of the greatest scenes in movie history. “I HATE YOU!!!!!”“You were my brother Anakin... I loved you...”Both actors did that scene perfectly. The emotions were passionate and real. Seriously, if you are a Star Wars fan and haven’t seen this movie, go see it. It saved the prequels after the disaster that was AotC. This movie is up there with Empire. 10/10 for me. There are some flaws, but the highs of this movie are so damn good that I have 0 regrets watching.",

What I liked about the film the most wasn't the action or the special effects (though those aspects remained spectacular as ever), but rather the character development, which was lacking in the previous two films. This movie was truly about Anakin and his transformation into to the Dark Side of the Force, and the movie consistently built up to the classic final showdown between him and his former master Obi-Wan, as well to the born of Darth Vader. \"Attack of the Clones\" was already quietly setting up that big plot point. We saw Anakin frustrated for not being elected as a Jedi master by the Council, and his dilemma on the nightmares he's been having about Padmé's death. From that, he becomes easily manipulated by Palpatine who puts the former against the Jedi.\r Now, there's some things I found myself disliking. The acting for instance was mostly bad. I didn't buy Hayden Christensen's performance when Padmé told Anakin she was pregnant. It was also really hard not to notice the over-the-top acting from some characters such as Senator Palpatine, when he killed Samuel Jackson's character, and screamed excessively, way longer than he should have.\r Of course, with all of this we had action, pretty nice action sequences combined with eye candy visuals, and sweet color palette. The lightsaber never gets old, and the sound effects were really great. While I'm not a Star Wars fan (at least not yet), I enjoyed much more the story arc around this time, and all that mythology paid off.\r Final Score: 7.5/10",

Did Anakin had to be so gullible, believing to save Padme just by using the Force, no matter how stupid that sounds? The prequels have been criticized for having too much politics in them, but I think the real problem here is with the trivial, overexposing dialogues surrounding each and every political choice. Was the imposing executive supposed to be a metaphor of the Bush jr. infamous presidency? At least Anakin has the decency of considering impeaching the Chancellor, but Christensen is just so bad at virtually everything he’s trying to deliver, that it’s impossible to find him believable.

Just as it was becoming possible to tune out the constant clanking of Lucas' lumbering dialogue the words are invested with real import. And just as we were getting used to the declarative ‘30s-style line readings that Lucas alone finds an adequate substitute for acting, the drama is asked to support some really heavy **** Many of the key components of the Star Wars legend — Vader’s birth, Padme’s death — are ultimately undone by dialogue that is ludicrous either in intent or execution.\r Sometimes you simply think “Noooo!”\r Mercifully then, the Star Wars myth is so powerful, so pre-imagined by so many, that much of it requires no explanation bar our constant narrator: the peerless John Williams. The twin duels that bring the third act to a rousing close confirm Sith as not just the darkest but also the prettiest entry in the saga — the lava landscape of Mustafa, in particular, has obviously been bubbling in Lucas imagination for nearly thirty years.

Wear blinders. Cover your ears. Because that's the only way you can totally enjoy Revenge of the Sith — the final and most futile attempt from skilled producer, clumsy director and tin-eared writer George Lucas to create a prequel trilogy to match the myth-making spirit of the original Wars saga he unleashed twenty-eight years ago. Fan boys, of course, have convinced themselves otherwise. So have several critics, if you go by early reviews.\r Heralded for its savagery (my God, it's rated PG-13), the film follows Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen — to merely call him wooden is an affront to puppets everywhere) as he loses his limbs and his conscience and takes on the evil mantle of Darth Vader. But thematic darkness is no excuse for dimness in all other departments, except the visual.\r In this heretic's opinion, Sith is a stiff, brought down by that special knack Lucas has of turning flesh-and-blood actors into cardboard cutouts. To hear Anakin and his pregnant wife, Senator Padme (the vivacious Natalie Portman rendered vacant), discuss their marriage — a secret that could get Anakin defrocked as a Jedi — is to redefine stilted for a new millennium. The minute any character — human or droid — opens a mouth to speak, your eyes glaze over.\r I kept thinking how much better Sith would play as a silent film, with only Chewbacca allowed to do his Wookiee growl and John Williams to trumpet his recycled score.nd yet, Revenge of the Sith is the movie that will do more business (my guess is $400 million-plus), sell more popcorn and brainwash more audiences than any blockbuster this summer. There are reasons: Sith is the last time Lucas will ever skywalk with the Skywalkers on the big screen (talk persists of a TV spinoff). There is enormous goodwill built up by the original series Lucas began in 1977 with Wars: A New Hope, continued in 1980 with The Empire Strikes Back and ended in 1983 with Return of the Jedi. All three of those movies belong in my personal time capsule, despite the Ewok blight on the last one. That's why you, me and everyone we know lined up for 1999's juvenile The Phantom Menace and 2002's atrocious Attack of the Clones. We watched with stifled yawns as Anakin grew from a snot-nosed kid (Jake Lloyd) to a whiny teen lover boy and wanna-be Jedi (Christensen). We justified the thudding lifelessness (a pox on those Jedi councils) by praising Lucas' digital artistry and nurturing the hope that Revenge of the Sith would spin our heads around with the dark magic of Darth Vader.\r Not even close. Until the last half-hour, when Lucas actually does establish a emotional connection between the landmark he created in 1977 and the prequel investment portfolio he laid out in 1999, the movie is one spectacularly designed letdown after another. Chief culprit? The script. Even with a reported polish by — say it isn't so — British playwright Tom Stoppard, the words are leaden, faux literate, mock-Shakespearean and devoid of humor. The late critic Pauline Kael once dismissed Wars as \"an epic without a dream.\" I disagree. Lucas' dream is a grand one: to build a mythic futuristic fantasy out of the influences of his youth — the Bible, the Bard, H.G. Wells, Jack London, John Ford westerns, Flash Gordon serials and long afternoons at the movies. If only for the original Wars, Lucas deserves a place in film history. He transformed pop culture into Pop Art.ucas' major error was believing he could do it all alone. With Empire — now officially the best of the Wars six — Lucas had the invaluable help of screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan (Raiders of the Lost Ark) and Leigh Brackett (The Big Sleep), and director Irvin Kershner, who knew how to loosen up actors. For those who wrongly criticized Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford back when, all I can say is, look and weep.\r As for the good stuff, none of it involves human speech. There's Obi-Wan taking on the droid general, Grievous, whose metal arms can swing four light-sabers. There's the massacre of the Jedi when Palpatine calls for Order 66. There's Palpatine taking on Yoda (again voiced by Frank Oz), whom he contemptuously calls my \"little green friend.\"\r ucas almost pulls the plot out of the fire in the film's final section, showing Obi-Wan hacking away at Anakin with his light-saber on the lava planet of Mustafar. Lucas even drops a hint that Anakin thinks Padme and Obi-Wan may have been getting it on. As we watch Anakin nearly melt in the lava, only to be put together, Frankenstein style, in a lab while Lucas intercuts scenes of Padme giving birth to the twins Luke and Leia, a link to genuine feeling is established at last. t's too little and too late. To hail Revenge of the Sith as a satisfying bridge to a classic is not just playing a game of the Emperor's New Clothes, it's an insult to what the original accomplished. To paraphrase Padme: This is how truth dies — to thunderous applause.",

All that Luke has'Star Wars': Darth Lite.\r The defining moment in George Lucas's entire \"Star Wars\" canon occurs in 1980's \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" when Darth Vader slices off Luke Skywalker's right hand and tells him he's Luke's father. All that Luke has trained for -- to be the chosen Jedi knight who defeats the Dark Lord of the Sith -- comes crashing down around his ears.\r As that revelation rings through your mind, you mentally backtrack through everything you've seen up to that point. Could it be true? The sinking feeling is confirmed: True indeed.\r That's what all these \"Star Wars\" prequels -- 1999's \"The Phantom Menace,\" 2002's \"Attack of the Clones\" and now \"Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith\" -- have been about: how everything got to this powerful, almost atavistic face-off.\r Now that \"Revenge\" officially brings these galactic chronicles to a close -- 28 years after the first \"Star Wars\" film -- the Darth-Luke climax remains the best scene of them all. And even though \"Revenge\" is a better experience than \"Phantom Menace\" or \"Attack of the Clones,\" it doesn't add anything that satisfying or compelling to the big picture. If anything, it takes things away. How could Hayden Christensen, a pouty-lipped twenty-something you'd expect to see handing you a tall decaf latte over the counter, be Darth Vader? And even if he was a good casting choice, how could any scene eclipse what we have already seen? \"Revenge\" was supposed to be the one that really socked it to us, about Anakin's almost biblical fall from grace. But the movie never rises to its powerful occasion.\r In \"Revenge,\" Jedi knights Anakin Skywalker (Christensen) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) have been fighting side by side in the Clone Wars. But their teamwork isn't perfect. Anakin tends to make rash decisions that give Obi-Wan pause.\r Obi-Wan's concern proves prescient. Anakin isn't going with the selfless-warrior program. He gets in a gaunt-cheeked tizzy because the inner circle of Jedi knights, including Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and Yoda, aren't bringing him up through the ranks fast enough.\r So he agrees to join forces with the hissable Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (who's really Darth Sidious in not-so-subtle disguise), with the opportunism of a Harvard brat shopping for the best law firm. He listens with ambitious ears when Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) -- already feuding with the Jedi council over his increasingly tyrannical nature -- invites him to be his personal assistant.\r It becomes clear that Anakin must choose between the selfless Jedi code, by which he has been raised, and Palpatine's invitation to dark power. Anakin hides this inner conflict, which affects his relationship with Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), whom he has married in secret and who is pregnant. He is breaking away from her, and the good side. You know this because he avoids eye contact and conversation with his wife, wears a hood and glares a lot.\r In terms of eye-candy action fare, \"Revenge\" has its battling high points. There's an exciting Obi-Wan clash with the skull-faced General Grievous, a separatist military leader, for instance. And the light saber mano a mano between Obi-Wan and Anakin, as they try not to be swallowed by a volcanic river underneath them, makes a thrilling fight.\r But the movie's characters -- as they are written, as they are cast and as they are performed -- detract from the movie's high purpose. As Anakin/Darth, Christensen is simply not compelling. Dark prince of the universe? Those Jedi knights ought to take him over their collective knees and spank him with light saber paddles until he gets over himself.\r As Amidala, Portman can't be faulted for a good college try. But she's too often reduced to a sobbing spectacle, as she whimpers and wah-wahs over her husband's moral disintegration. The story only gives her lip-service empowerment, as she struggles to get him back. (Perhaps this is to make sure Christensen doesn't get overshadowed.) McGregor makes a likable Obi-Wan, but with that silly posh accent he's forced to affect, he's a Wan imitator of his predecessor (or narratively speaking, his later self), Sir Alec Guinness. Gravitas was always going to be a tough thing to pull off for these three principals, who are essentially kiddie pawns in Lucas's giant, computer-generated chess game. But if there was a chance to break out, none has grabbed that light saber.\r Of course, your humble reviewer does not assume to tell the jillions of devoted \"Star Wars\" fans they can't enjoy this movie on their own terms. But if they're waiting for the second coming, in his opinion, it happened in 1980. By creating one of the greatest villains of the screen, George Lucas simply couldn't deconstruct Darth Vader's awesome mystique.",

Even now in 2016 this is still a phenomenal looking movie. It blows away just about every modern movie in the special effects department. The world of Star Wars has never looked more alive.\r I've said it once and I'll say it again, George Lucas can craft an action scene like no other. The fights here are probably his best work. They're intense, powerful, and incredible to behold. Whether it's an all out war or a more personal one-on-one duel, Lucas delivers on all fronts. The action is a sight to behold.\r So how's that writing? For starters Lucas gives the \"romantic\" dialog from Attack of the Clones a lot of much needed improvement. There's no cringe worthy dialog shared between Anakin and Padme here (some goofier lines are present, but incredibly rare). Not only that, but the politics so many hated listening too in the previous two movies of the prequel trilogy have once again been mercifully toned down. Without going into too much detail let me just say that everything that needed to be done to tie up the trilogy before moving into A New Hope has been handled masterfully.\r This is an emotional, powerful ending that gives more depth to the original Star Wars films in ways I won't dare spoil. On top of all that, the movie is just really darn funny. The chemistry between McGregor (Obi-Wan) and Christensen (Anakin) is great. The relationship between the two characters is expanded upon and they have tons of dialog together that really only two close individuals could have. I leads to quite a few laughs. That's not to say those two are the only sources of humor. Lucas has provided many amusing moments throughout the course of the film. At least until it's time for things to get serious.\r Diving a little bit deeper into Christensen's role as Anakin, I can thankfully say that actor has upped his game. Gone is the wooden, awkward performance from Episode II. He gives a respectable performance here and really does the character justice. Part of that is also due to improved writing for the character. The same can be said for the rest of the cast as well.\r It's an exciting, emotion, dark, and enchanting close to the prequel trilogy. Lucas pulled out all of the stops to deliver a finale that could please even the most devoted prequel hater. Everything is wrapped up and we get the conclusion we deserve. Only a few minor quibbles here and there keep it from reaching perfection. I was amazed all the way though.\r 9.9/10",

In my opinion, although the movie is shot very well and by far looks the most appealing to the eye (save when they reversed Anakin), it can be a bit much at times at can appear quite unrealistic. (Kind of looks like a video game when Anakin and Obi-Wan are dueling on the lava planet). Also, at times, the dialogue is pretty dry and seems to attempt at forcing a point across or set up a following scene rather than emotionally developing characters/including the dry wit of the original trilogy. This movie happens to be the most outstanding of a quite disappointing trilogy, and aside from all of its faults, actually contains some of the best lightsaber fights of any Star Wars movies, so something is to be said for that. In its favor, Return of the Jedi explains some much-needed missing pieces to the Star Wars series (Anakin becoming Darth Vader, etc.), so in that sense, this movie is needed. To conclude, did it really have to be 2 and a half hours long?",

Though you can see it from a mile away the betrayal of the Clones with Order 66 is probably the best moment of the movie.  Unfortunately, the moment that the entire trilogy, nay the entire Star Wars series up to that point, counts on fails miserably.  That moment is Anakin's falls to the darkside and it is unforgivable thus the hard rating.  From the original trilogy we were told that Anakin was seduced by the power of the darkside.  Instead it went something like this:Through half of the movie, Anakin is shown to be a trusted Jedi who has a great relationship with his mentor and friend Obi-wan Kenobi.When the two Jedi friends are separated, Palpatine starts \"luring\" Anakin to the darkside with tales of the Sith and trying to pit the Jedi Knight against the council.Anakin finally learns that Palpatine is the Sith Lord that they have been looking for.  He never puts 2 and 2 together that, as the Sith Lord, Palpatine has been playing both sides of the war.  Obvious because there are always only 2 Sith and Dooku was named as a Sith earlier in the movie.  Palpatine has been the reason for so many Jedi and Clone Troopers murdered and countless of civilians killed over the past few years. Anakin doesn't seem to care.Palpatine feeds him some line that he can help him save Padme from death.  This is the guy that hid from Anakin for 13 years the fact that he was the sworn enemy of the Jedi.At first Anakin goes to inform the Jedi Council who immediately send a group over to arrest the chancellor.  Here we see the worst excuse for a lightsaber fight in Star Wars' history.  It's just laughable.  Jedi MASTERS literally just stand there while they get stabbed.Anakin walks in at the last minute and has to make a quick decision to save:A) the sworn enemy of the Jedi that just lied to him for 13 yearsB) his friend, colleagues and brothers who helped raise him since a boyThe rest goes down in terrible cinematic history.Palpatine's first order after Anakin's heart wrenching decision is to go back to the temple and murder everyone he has ever known... and some children.Anakin goes from heroic war-hero savior to child slayer in less than 2 hours.Where was the gradual seduction to the power of the darkside?  Instead we got some seduction by a creepy old liar and one hasty split second decision.

Apparently the actor Ian McDiarmid (hugely underrated actor by the way) wasn't meant to scream out like he did but he improvised that brilliant screech and when you hear it you really feel the power of the dark side.

He is arrogant, whines a lot, very self-absorbed, huge ego with a chosen one syndrome. The love between Anakin and Padme felt unnatural, fake and had no real connection. The best way to portray a tragic hero is following a character we love, who tragically falls apart but finds a way to redeem himself in the end; this has been a plot device to set up a Tragic Character since Greek Tragedy. The story arc for Anakin/Vader in ep4-6 portrays his eventual redemption perfectly. But the prequels did not set up any love for this character. If I could rewrite the character for the prequels I would follow these plot points:\r Make him older ep1 (like Luke and Rey), no mom or christ-like birth (to cliche), no one knows where he came from (add mystery instead of explaining everything). No more, \"Yipppy Skippy,\" from a child actor.\r Falls in love through the action of the plot (like Han and Leia) instead of standing around discussing it for 40 minutes in Attack of the Clones.\r Has a great sense of humor, saves the day, humbly, like a real hero during ep1 and 2. He was to serious in the films. Take a breath bud.\r Padme gets pregnant unexpectedly, Jedi ban him from the order in ep3 due to relationship with Padme (the Jedi should have flaws in these films, they should not be perfect, adds dimension, provides context to Anakins views of the Jedi).\r Palpatine offers him a job by his side, Padme, who is at odds with Palpatine, becomes estranged from Anakin due to his decision to join him, she runs to the Obi Wan and the Jedi and secretly gives birth.\r Anakin asks Obi Wan (still best friends) to watch over her when he goes on a mission, Palpatine secretly sets up a plot which kills Padme while she is under Obi Wan and the Jedi protection.\r Anakin goes ape **** turns to the dark side, blames the jedi/Obi Wan until ep 6. Also sets up a more emotional fight between Anakin and Obi Wan.\r Most importantly, as an audience, we see a character we love fall apart over a lie setup by Palpatine. Though the elements of manipulating Anakin do exist as George Lucas wrote them, they were poorly executed and Anakin's motivation to turn to the dark side was weak (I had a bad dream, I need new force powers to save her because I'm the most powerful jedi ever, I should be a Master in the Jedi order because I'm the chosen one with the best force powers, Obi Wan is an idiot and I've got better force powers than him, but I killed Padme in the end because I'm an unlovable psycho with force powers)",

I left the theater speechless. I was moved. I was blown away. Not only was it arguably the best film, it made all the others better as well.Revenge of the Sith: The most emotionally powerful, dramatic and visually stunning. In my opinion, best acted, written and directed of the Saga. I love every moment. The first 25min. is such a rush. R2-D2  rocked, the three way fight with Dooku, Star Wars at it's finest. Grievous is just awesome! 9 times , I've seen this film, the most I've ever seen one film at the movies, 9 times my heart shot up my throat hearing that painful cry when Anakin realizes he lost everything he loved, by his own hand at that. That cry sent a shiver up my spine every single time I heard it. Order 66. The Anakin/Obi-Wan duel, exciting, heart wrenching.    This film is, for lack of a better word, BRILLIANT!  It was everything I could have hoped for in a Star Wars movie, hell any movie.",

Epic and powerful music is just great. The story is great. A great way to end an amazing successful sic-fi series. Visuals are mind-blowing. The action, set pieces, giant battlegrounds, its just phenomenal how amazing it is. Overall, this is one of the best star wars movies. They really went out on a bang. They really did good with this movie. You really should go see this movie.",

Anakin's decision between Windu and Palpatine is a mirror to Anakin's decision between Palpatine and Luke in RotJ, and creates a very strong connection between these scenes. The moment he solidifies himself as evil, and then in RotJ, the moment he tries to redeem himself. It's good writing. The movie has some weak points and some details were silly, but if you take a step back and see the overall trilogy as conveying Darth Vader's fall to the dark side, this is a compelling story and the films portray it well.",
