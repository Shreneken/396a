  "critic_reviews": [
    "It's the most compelling American movie to come around in a long, long time.",
    "Haggis writes with such directness and such a good ear for everyday speech that the characters seem real and plausible after only a few words. His cast is uniformly strong; the actors sidestep cliches and make their characters particular.",
    "The stunning, must-see drama Crash is proof that words have not lost the ability to shock in our anesthetized society.",
    "Not just one of the best Hollywood movies about race, but, along with \"Collateral,\" one of the finest portrayals of contemporary Los Angeles life period.",
    "Hyper-articulate and often breathtakingly intelligent and always brazenly alive. I think it's easily the strongest American film since Clint Eastwood's \"Mystic River,\" though it is not for the fainthearted.",
    "This is the rare American film really about something, and almost all the performances are riveting.",
    "What makes Crash so gripping--so terrifying in spots, so moving in others, and even a little funny at times--is how nothing happens as we think it will.",
    "Like Robert Altman's \"Short Cuts,\" it is an all-star fresco, but the stars--none of whom carries the movie--get to play the kind of morally ambivalent, sometimes unlikable parts that big-name actors usually avoid.",
    "Crash fools around with chronology in a Tarantinoesque way that brings its story full circle. You could argue that as events, and people, merge, Haggis' spiky screenplay (cowritten with Bobby Moresco) gets to be, quite simply, too much.",
    "The acting is dynamite, notably by Dillon and Newton in their shocking second encounter. Despite its preachy moments, the film is a knockout.",
    "Flaws are outweighed by Crash's intricate construction and intelligent.",
    "A haunting, perceptive and uncompromising examination of controversial subject matter, expertly written and directed by Paul Haggis and characterised by excellent performances from its starry cast.",
    "It's a film you won't stop thinking about, arguing over, debating, after the lights come up.",
    "Never reaches the heights of \"Short Cuts\" or \"Magnolia\" -- two multi-story films that clearly provided inspiration -- but it's a thoughtful road trip well worth taking.",
    "Unfortunately, the running time is too short for us to get to know, or care about, the characters in a way that would make the film's themes strike a responsive chord.",
    "The result is a film where blisteringly naturalistic drama bumps up against sentimentally arch melodrama (that's the biggest collision in Crash). Haggis showed the same tendency in his script for \"Million Dollar Baby,\" yet there it was better hidden under a simpler narrative. Here, the tendency has gotten magnified right along with his thematic ambitions.",
    "The tense drama eventually becomes off-putting when it becomes clear almost every scene hinges on an unpleasant or ugly racial interaction.",
    "Crash can't rise from the ashes of its pessimism.",
    "Its characters come straight from the assembly line of screenwriting archetypes, and too often they act in ways that archetypes, rather than human beings, do. You can feel its creator shuttling them here and there on the grid of greater LA, pausing portentously between each move.",
    "Haggis has made a safe picture. It is familiar enough that it slips easily into our film-watching faculty without any fuss, yet his handling of it--his muscular belief in what he is doing--makes us hope that his next screenplay will be a bit less safe.",
    "Haggis, who wrote the fine adapted screenplay for \"Million Dollar Baby,\" embeds Crash's script so deeply in allegory that every revelation feels manipulative and programmatic, in spite of some terrific individual scenes and performances.",
    "Full of well-observed supporting riffs, Crash might've accumulated more frisson had it cast a clearer eye on how social tension actually plays.",
    "New York critics have anointed Crash in advance as the Second Coming, but it's just another over-ambitious first movie.",
    "A well-intentioned but obvious, often clumsy picture.",
    "Pivots on the characters' racism and xenophobia, playing tricks with our own biases and ultimately justifying an extravagant array of coincidences and surprises.",
    "Any glimpse of emotional honesty comes courtesy of the actors, who manage to do a credible job despite the material.",
    "Almost certain to polarize audiences, this bit of emotional agitprop plays like a watered-down \"Short Cuts\" or \"Magnolia\" with a shrill, one-note message: We're all a little bit racist.",
    "An ambitious, intense, but overdetermined exploration of the varieties of ethnic intolerance.",
    "It's too bad that the movie induces eyeball-rolling almost as much as it does armrest-clutching.",
    "These interlocking stories don't move along as swiftly or as urgently as they should, and much of the dialogue thumps along on square wheels.",
    "In the end, Crash lacks a cumulative impact. It takes audiences to new places, but we've all been to similar places, and we walk out knowing no more than we did walking in.",
    "So what kind of a movie is Crash? A frustrating movie: full of heart and devoid of life; crudely manipulative when it tries hardest to be subtle; and profoundly complacent in spite of its intention to unsettle and disturb.",
    "The result is a hybrid of \"Falling Down\" and \"Short Cuts\" without the iconic central character of the former or the latter's clear-eyed humanism.",
    "Concludes in a shower of ashes, which is fitting because this movie is a billowing bonfire of ugly human behavior. Rarely have there been so many characters in need of timeouts, cold showers or house arrests.",
    "It might even have been a landmark film about race relations had its aura of blunt realism not been dispelled by a toxic cloud of dramaturgical pixie dust."

I usually hate when people say something like, \"If you didn't like this movie, you didn't understand it,\" but I'm actually reading the reasons people don't like, and they seem to indicate just that. They say the message is obvious, and then they go on to say the message is that racism is bad. That's not the message. It's already assumed that racism is bad. The movie is pointing out where it exists in seemingly normal circumstances. It challenges the viewer to question how they would've handled certain situations; if they would've been as prejudiced as the characters. The dialogue is thought provoking and interesting. Some say it isn't natural, but neither is Shakespearean dialogue, or the characters singing conversations in movies. It's used to challenge the viewer, and to make them think about important issues that we don't think about. It's not just racism, it's the details of racism's effect on various different people. The discussions may not be natural, but they're based on very real issues.\r The movie is also, as Ebert said as well, more about ideas than people. For those who want more character depth, it's not really about the people themselves, but about how people in general are conditioned by society to handle certain situations. It's better that the people be as generic as possible, to show that the way they're acting isn't because of their specific personalities, it's because they are normal people, acting as an average person would. It challenges you to question yourself, instead of showing you a person who has a specific personality that is nothing like yours. Basically, this movie is good in a way that doesn't follow the formula of what traditionally makes a movie good. That's why people have a problem with it. The use of connecting the storylines is not just made for poignancy, it's to show how closely we are connected to each other; how our thoughts and actions have effects on people, and we don't even realize it. It's about how society's views creep so easily into our minds and become our own views, without us thinking anything of it. And to the person who said this writer is in high school, no. He's actually a three time nominee for writing. Two of his movies one Best Picture, another was nominated, and two others got rave reviews and made a ton of critics' lists. He knows what he's doing, even if some people don't understand it.",

In the ensemble cast include Brendan Fraser as the District Attorney, his opinionated and perhaps paranoid wife played by Sandra Bullock, who are both carjacked by the talkative and philosophical Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges who has all the answers to the racial problems that sweep America, along with his friend.\rWe also have a racist LAPD officer in Matt Dillon, who cuts a hardened and bitter man with his own personal grief, which he takes out on others, especially a black couple on their way home one night who have did nothing wrong, these two are played by Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard. In the bigger frame of it all we have recurring character Don Cheadle, a detective in Los Angeles. Of course these stories intertwine in often dramatic circumstances, some become unspoken enemies while others become unlikely heroes. The exact point here is the perception of the individuals being shown, many times there is no intent involved in this wide variety of characters, but their race is enough for other people to judge or be judged by, this message is relatable for the fact that this is still a problem, a problem which is addressed with the fullest attention by Paul Haggis, director and co-writer, who links these very different stories in the most unlikely yet understandable of ways, who could have thought that racist cop who basically molests an innocent woman, ends up saving the exact same woman from a burning car on the highway.  Each of these people interact with each other one way or another, sometimes with tragic results.\rThere is retribution, however, to be had with these characters, who learn the error of their ways through luck, chance, drastic circumstances or just talking to others, saying that, there are those who feel that they are indeed being discriminated against and want to take matters into their own hands one in particular being a Persian shop owner, played by Shaun Toub.\rThe scope and detail that goes into making each character as interesting as the next, they all have hate and opinions, but all this proves is that they are human. A wonderful, calm and fitting score accompanies the film, highlighting pivotal points and shining moments. With a cast that also includes Ryan Phillippe, Jennifer Esposito and Michael Peña, there are some emotional and finely executed performances in the film, they each play a role that demands attention for the message they are sending, a problem is not necessarily being addressed and sorted, but it is being shown in plain sight for the world to see.",

More specifically, Los Angeles. A metropolis feeding on the minds ofPaul Haggis's 'Crash' its so much more than ye-olde-school racism. It is about the lack of human connections and mental damages brought up by living in modern America. More specifically, Los Angeles. A metropolis feeding on the minds of people, overflowing with concepts of hatred and anger brought by its hectic pace.\"It's the sense of touch\" says Detective Graham (Don Cheadle) after a close-call car accident. \"In LA nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much that we crash into each other just to feel something\". His partner and lover Ria (Jennifer Esposito) thinks he might have lost his frame of reference, which might be true. But these ideas were always deep inside him and maybe this brush with mortality just made them come forth.The film spawns a glassy and gloomy soundtrack occasionally containing sublime and dramatic world music and its visual style is polished and deeply introspective. Shots follow the characters beautifully as they clash with the surrounding neon lights of the big city. There is technical prowess in 'Crash' and, like all great films, there is no moment of pause. Los Angeles is the Haggis's chosen melting pot for not only necessarily race, but varying human ideologies. The 5-6 subplots are switched from one to another with relative ease, and often they split into more or they rejoin one another.Yet deep down, this is a film not about racial discrimination and eventual awareness, but about people and how ridiculous they can be. Scenes are switched at a fast pace, yet there is not one which is not interesting. Each one is focused, thorough and in a couple of minutes Haggis is more psychoanalytical than most films are in hours. He puts his characters in worst-case scenarios which they pass, but this might just be the first film which is about the lingering emotions brought up by those situations rather than the situations themselves. It is this what makes this film truly emotionally powerful.It's funny how things work. And as the film progresses each of its characters are drawn to an eventual silver-lining; most of them finding solace, overcoming and awakening from their emotional coldness. Snow falls over Los Angeles as people go on about their lives. Just like before, consumed by quotidian anarchy masquerading as order, feeling regret, love, hate, sadness; and I felt everything too. It was so familiar. But in the end, I just laughed at everything and thought to myself: \"people, man... people\".",

The strokes are so broad, and most of the set-ups so obvious that even the bits that do work and are affecting are blown out of the water ten seconds later by something so eye-rollingly hideous - a girl is told that she's got her father's invisible shield to protect her against bullets... What happens next? Duh. Some of the stories are incredibly slight and trivial - Sandra Bullock has three conversations and that's her narrative. Other ones are insanely implausible - a TV director whose had two difficult experiences in a day after (presumably) a life of dealing with racial tensions, suddenly goes loopy for no obvious reason. Worst of all is the cynicism here - and this the bit where I really agree with one of the other reviewers here - the whole film operates on the assumption that people aren't good or bad, they're just trying to get through difficult circumstances - and it also operates under the assumption that if depressing and cynical films are 'artful' then REALLY depressing and cynical films must be Leonardo da Vincis. So everyone is corrupt or evil in one way or another - only one character is honourable all the way through, the rest are universally just different shades of self-involved wankery. You come out of the cinema not uplifted by people's struggles or wiser in the race wars, but sickened by your fellow man, disgusted by our whole revolting species. This isn't a tragedy, it's a self-indulgent, wallowing, decadent film that reveals the bankrupcy of the film-maker's spirit - a man who can afford the luxury of an absolute loss of faith and wants to take the whole world down with him. Not very good. I'd go as far as to say that in its representation of humans as universally corrupt, it's very nearly evil.",

Though the premise is pure contrivance, it's a epic one which begs for suspended disbelief. Paul Haggis cleverly paints stereotypical portraits of this film's multiple protagonists using the prejudices and preconceptions of those who surround them, only to then turn the audience into confidants, revealing key details of the protagonists' lives unknown to those in the story.

At that time,This film is quite interesting for several reasons, and I can understand why it won the Oscar for \"Best Film\" in 2006: its a film that combines several stories around a theme that was relevant that year: racism and prejudice. At that time, many people thought that it won this award so that it wouldn't end up in more \"gay friendly\" films (\"Capote\" and \"Brokeback Mountain\", also nominated), but I think that's an unfair idea. \"Crash\" is a film with more merit than it looks, although it went unnoticed through the theaters then.The script joins a series of isolated stories and sub-plots around a single theme: prejudice, the way we judge someone by their color, ethnicity or social origin. In the film, this is the great \"leitmotiv\" that unites all the stories, making the plot very difficult to describe succinctly. The characters do not know each other, they are not connected, but they get to know each other through casual situations, which could happen to ourselves: going to a store, repairing a lock, stealing a car, a routine police stop. Its necessary to pay attention, and even so I guarantee that many intentional details will go unnoticed - I had to see the film three times to be able to evaluate it fairly, and to write this review cost me a few hours of reading too.Another important detail is the extreme quality of the dialogues. There is no theatricality or politically correct: a negro is a negro. The language is crude, although it does not use profanity or slang. The way it affects the characters is genuine and we can put ourselves in their shoes. About this, its a film that can be quite hard to endure, especially for those who have been through situations of prejudice. Of course, its an admittedly militant film with some moralizing edge, given that it tries to convey an anti-racist message and defend this, but the cinema is full of militant films and I think this will only displease seriously those who oppose that more fiercely. Personally, I handled it very well.Although it has a carefully selected cast, with some big names, we cannot say that there is a protagonist. Everyone is a protagonist in the story that concerns them. Personally, I liked the performance of Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe in the role of two very different policeman; Don Cheadle wears the skin of an investigator; Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser gave us characters from the white elite; Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard were also excellent in the role of rich and successful black people; Larenz Tate and Ludacris are good at the two outcasts; the film also features the excellent performances of Michael Peña, Bahar Soomekh, Loretta Devine, Jennifer Esposito, Howard Fong and Shaun Toub. Of course, given the theme, many of the characters - not to say almost all - will have attitudes that will displease us, but they were thought like that.Technically, the film has one of the best editing works I've seen in a long time: despite the intricate plot and mix of stories, everything is logical and in the right place, justifying the Oscar for Best Editing that it also received. The film runs at a very pleasant pace too, without wasting time. But its basically just that! The film conveys the feeling of having been thought for TV and is marked by uninteresting technical elements: a regular cinematography, sets and costumes and an almost atonal soundtrack. Technically, its a film that I would compare to food without salt: it has no flavor.",

Not everyone will like it, not everyone will be able to take all the racism issues in and truly understand what is going on out there. This movie isnt another Hollywood blockbuster, it rather shows the twisted reality of our society in its true uglyness. It also shows that racism in this country goes either way...Well done, it is definately worth every penny i spent on it.",

The racial dialogue and prejudice is so piercing you may even consider walking out, but stick with the film, because it is one of the best Hollywood made movies about race. The multiple parallel events and its characters is shocking and astonishing. Especially how it all comes together. The actors are superb, especially Matt Dillion, Terrrence Howard and even Ludacris. I have read some critics who felt the film was too obvious, over the top, and puffed up conclusion. If so, it only adds to some of the toughest talk even seen on the American screen. The final scene tells it all. Paul Haggis the director/writer also was the screen write for \"Million Dollar Baby,\" and Clint has signed him up for his next two films. What does that tell you?",

Most of the characters in this film are angry ... angry at the seemingly lack of control they have over their own lives, a circumstance Crash is a compelling drama that examines the cultural, ethic and racial conflicts in American society. Most of the characters in this film are angry ... angry at the seemingly lack of control they have over their own lives, a circumstance they blame on everyone who is not racially identical to themselves. Appropriately, the movie begins with a car operated by an Asian woman crashing into the rear of a car operated by a Latino woman and in which a black man is a passenger (symbolically, a clash of cultures). As the Asian confronts the Latino, claiming that the other \"blaked\" too fast, the Negro reflects that modern day society has separated people into areas protected by \"glass and steel\" so that they no longer are in touch with each other and eventually people become so angry with this situation that they feel compelled to crash into someone just to have contact with another human being. In a typical scene where the characters are angry at the stereotypes that others categorizes them in, while not realizing they are as equally guilty, there is this exchange between a black man and a Latino woman: He: \"I told my mother that I was having sex with a white woman because I knew that would upset her; if I told her it was a Mexican, she would hardly care.\" She: \"My father is from Puerto Rico, my mother's from El Salvador, neither of which is Mexico.\" He: \"Well, then, I guess the big mystery is, who gathered up all of those different cultures and taught them all how to park their cars on their front lawns.\" The movie takes the threads of the lives of several people and slowly interweaves them over a two day period to make a tapestry of racial prejudice that forms when you see not the person before you but only the color of his skin. While the characters literally see each other in black and white, the movie beautifully portrays how there is no such easy division between \"good and evil\" and that these qualities exists in us all; we all are really just shades of \"gray\", more alike than any of us would care to admit. A unique, imaginative, unpredictable movie; the tension of the characters is effectively transmitted to the audience and magnifies your anticipation. Not everything turns out \"right\" in this film ... because that's how life really is. I give this one a 9.25.",

There are a number of scenes where a This film bravely looks rasicm in the eye and exposes it for what it is - cultural insensitivity and misunderstanding that becomes generalized to a set of people defined by color or race or whatever. There are a number of scenes where a person of one race or background doesn't get what a person of another race or background is doing, saying, or intending with his actions and the results are tragic (or potentially so). Sure it's unrealistic in terms of too many coincidences but the whole idea is he's telling the story of people who's lives were intertwined by the various car accidents. To suggest that Haggis was supposed to offer a solution to the racial conflicts in this film, misses the point. By showing how insensitivities balloon into true danger (or in a few cases how being sensitized can help defuse a difficult situation) he is giving us all a mirror into which we can look and ask ourselves: do I do that? And if enough people asked that, and dealt with it, we'd have a less racist society. There is no other solution that could be offered. I never saw the \"Magnolia\" movie people mention here but I did see parallels to \"Amores Perros\" and to \"21 Grams\". Tthe method of story telling is a fairly effective way to draw together all these disparate people into a series of mini-dramas that you could follow in one film. Finally I was surprised by Sandra Bullock, who I thought was great, and thought all the performances were superb. Tell everyone to see this movie.
