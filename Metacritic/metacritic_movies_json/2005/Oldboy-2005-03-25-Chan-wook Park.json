  "critic_reviews": [
    "It's a movie of such jaw-dropping violence, wild improbability and dazzling style it overpowers all resistance.",
    "This hunt for revenge is really a quest for self-discovery. The story, acting and brilliant directing elevate Oldboy into a human struggle to know yourself and your place in the universe, and to live with that sometimes terrible knowledge.",
    "Oldboy is a powerful film not because of what it depicts, but because of the depths of the human heart which it strips bare.",
    "Park's direction is flawless and Jung Jung-hoon's cinematography is stunning.",
    "Startling and amazing -- a cinematic hammer to the skull.",
    "It's a movie that you feel you're not so much watching on screen as having beamed directly into your skull from some malign, alien planet of horror.",
    "Whatever its oversteps and excesses (I do think Park ran a little amok with the computer gimcrackery), Oldboy has the bulldozing nerve and full-blooded passion of a classic.",
    "Anguished, beautiful and desperately alive, Oldboy is a dazzling work of pop-culture artistry.",
    "It's a work of art for sure, but a sadistic one. Oldboy is one of the year's best; it just isn't for everyone. If you're still interested, go for it.",
    "As always with Park Chanwook, you just hold on and let him rip.",
    "Once the picture gets into Hollywood's bloodstream, it could well prove to be as influential as John Woo's 1989 crime thriller, \"The Killer.\"",
    "A wild, intensely cinematic ride into two men's burning desire to get even.",
    "The result is a powerfully visceral experience that justifies itself almost entirely on surface chops, with striking color composition and a complex sound design that elevates the story to an operatic scale.",
    "Obviously, this sort of taboo-flouting imagery isn't for everyone, but Park's vision is all of a piece.",
    "This is absolutely not a film for all tastes, but it's a masterpiece of pitiless power whose audacious, ambiguous climax strikes a note of insane romanticism as haunting as it is perverse.",
    "You will surely leave this movie shocked, shaken and surprisingly moved. And definitely stuck on that poor octopus.",
    "Its magnificence is that it takes itself dead serious. It's not entertainment, but it's sure a piece of toughness.",
    "While the climax is admittedly something of a letdown after all the build-up, it's a hopelessly, helplessly original film, all guts, no glory.",
    "Regardless of how you look at Oldboy, it's unlike anything you are likely to have seen before.",
    "As mysterious as it is sinister.",
    "More than anything else, Oldboy recalls Alfred Hitchcock with all restraint tossed to the wind, or Hitchcock's most obsessed devotee, Brian De Palma, at his most nastily inspired.",
    "This nightmarish revenge drama from Korea is grueling, intense, cruel -- the very definition of extreme cinema.",
    "This is a movie about draining, tenderizing and chopping up the audience emotionally.",
    "It says something when you come out of a film as weird and fantastical as Oldboy and feel that you've experienced something truly authentic. I just don't know what. I can't think of anything to compare it to.",
    "It's just the kind of film that you'd expect a jury led by Quentin Tarantino to choose, a bloody and brutal revenge film immersed in madness and directed with operatic intensity.",
    "Oldboy has the fatal air of wanting so desperately to be a cult movie that it forgets to present itself as a coherent one.",
    "Oldboy caused a love-it-or-hate-it stir at Cannes last year, and how could it not: It's an onslaught made to cause a sensation. Consider me simultaneously jolted and depressed.",
    "Entertaining to watch - notwithstanding the scene in which Dae-su eats a live animal - which is a good thing, because there is not much to think about here, outside of the choreographed mayhem.",
    "Despite its director's skill at staging trash with dash, Oldboy is too long and portentous to be an enjoyable B movie. The movie's self-seriousness short-circuits its sensationalism.",
    "There's a lot less here than meets the eye.",
    "Put simply, in my humble opinion, Oldboy sucks."

The second instalment of the Vengeance trilogy, and by far the best of the three. Oh Dae Su is a modern day Monte Cristo (as is the antagonist, the sociopath) But while the latter is imprisoned by demons  of his mind, poor Oh Dae Su is imprisoned in the literal sense. When he is released, its vengeance VS freedom. Too many times, he could have simply walked away from it all, and lived a happy life, but instead chose the path to vengeance, which leads to one of the most hideous immoral and perverse endings ever. Im not gonna spil it, but the reasoning behind his imprisonment is a bit contrived- and it could have been something a bit more solid, but it is still believable, if you put yourself in the antagonist's mind. Now lets talk art- the cinematography is breathtaking. Obscure angles, too-wide shots, split screens...all this with BOLD bright colors and high contrast, make this movie incredibly pretty to look at.  Theres some pretty epic gorey scenes with a hammer, and a sweet fighting scene set to a beautiful score (This is one of my favorite movie soundtracks, gogo Vivaldi!).\rIts a tragic tale of two mens revenge. One man in the end, dosent get to kill his adversary(and the closure he gets is pretty crappy, once he finds out the why, but hey, when your dealing with a psycho, what can you expect?), while the other succeeds in completely ruining the others life.",

After hearing everyone talk about Oldboy in my East Asian Cinema class, I decided take the plunge and see it at the Nuart. I didn?t know what to expect, which is probably a blessing; expectations can go a long way towards ruining a film. Dae-su, the protagonist, starts out as a useless drunk. Then, seemingly for no reason, he is held in a room for fifteen long years, left with only a television to entertain him. His meals come from a slot under his door, and every once and while he?s knocked out with sleeping gas. When he wakes up, his hair has been cut and he?s been given a shave. Through his TV, he learns that he is being charged with the murder of his wife. Someone clearly has revenge on his mind, but who? And for what purpose? Freud would approve. Since the plot hinges on a central revelation, I won't say anything else about it. Instead, I'll talk about some standout scenes. In a cinematic moment that has become infamous already, Dae-su (who looks just beastly with hair teased within an inch of it's life) walks into a sushi bar after being released and asks to eat something \"alive.\" He chomps into a live octopus, but before he can finish, he faints, one tentacle still squirming. On a visceral level, I was repulsed. But then I remembered that this guy just missed out on more than a decade of living and just wanted to feel vital again. In some strange way, my heart went out to him. Eventually, Dae-su figures out where he was incarcerated. So great is his fury that he storms in without any forethought, armed only with a small hammer that he picks up along the way. In a long shot of a hallway, he does battle with his former jailers, displaying an emotion I can only categorize as ?primal rage.\" Even a knife in his back can?t do much more than slow him down. What made the scene captivating was the fact that violence was used to highlight an emotion, rather than for mere shock value. If you have a strong stomach and a taste for black humor, you'd do well to see this movie.",

In fact, if I were forced to list my favorite movies period to be made since my birth in 1980, this would most definitely be near, if not AT the top of that list. Park has very quickly, in my mind (ever since my exposure to his Joint Security Area) skyrocketed to the top two or three directors of the generation.  He not only can tell a story, perfectly balancing the surreal and aesthetic qualities that make cinema interesting, not only can he present those concepts in such a way as to allow the viewer to suspend disbelief and become personally invested in the overall arc, but he can do so without throwing his intellect out the door as many directors are wont to do in the interest of making something flashy to hold their viewers interest.Now that seems like very high praise in a general sense toward the director, and it is, and yet this film and the films preceding and succeeding it in his roster move a step further into something wholly visceral, tragic and unimaginably investing.  This film in particular, is quite possibly the only film to have been made in the last decade that I would actually be perfectly comfortable placing the name \"Shakespearean\" to.  The tragedy of this film, Mr Vengeance and Lady Vengeance are such that if this director, and for that matter the actors, and crew who put themselves into this film aren't remembered along with the likes of Aronofsky, Goddard, Welles and the like it would be a true miscarriage of justice.  I would recommend any person with a love of tragedy, action, mystery or just a love of cinema in general seek out this film, I've watched this from beginning to end at the very least two dozen times (not including the playthroughs I've done with the commentaries on the Tartan \"Asia Extreme\" boxed set I own), and I've yet to become tired of it.

Visually stunning as well as emotionally visceral. On the surface the narrative is very straightforward, but little is as it seems throughout the entire film up till the last few minutes. Not for the weak of heart Oldboy has some of the most violent sequences that I have witnessed.\r Oldboy does many things extremely well. From the opening sequence we are treated to a score that adds much to the film. Having a great score but knowing how to properly use it so as to not allow it to overwhelm the film is not an easy task. Park does it perfectly in Oldboy. Park also uses the split screen masterfully in this movie. This is another device that I have seen used to the detriment of a movie, not so here. Park is an artist with the camera. One sequence in particular stands out for me. The main character comes to a location that is familiar to him and important to a memory that he is trying to recall. As he recalls this memory he chases the memory of his younger self through the sequence. It is beautifully shot, we never lose our sense of time or place as can easily happen in such a scene.\r The visuals and score are not the only positives in Oldboy. The narrative is gripping and tense. Our protagonist is on a mission of revenge for what has been done to him. We are along for the journey every step of the way. We feel every emotion that he is feeling as his story progresses. We feel his fear, torment, and hatred. Like all good revenge stories as he begins to reek his havoc we wonder at what cost it is coming. Are his motives pure, and even of they are is it worth the price it is costing his soul. Oldboy handles these themes masterfully.\r I have two issues with this film. The first is I was never completely on board with the character of Mi-do. It is not a spoiler to say that we learn very early on that she has had a very similar experience to the protagonist. Despite this fact we are given she always seems to be much more aware than he is. He spends the film unraveling a mystery, she appears to understand most of what is happening but is just relying on him for protection from it. My second issue is the ending. While much is revealed in the last third and there are some very well done intense scenes, the last five minutes lacks the punch that a film like this needs.\r Oldboy is an amazingly directed film that is well worth your time. While you may not wish to revisit this world, you will be happy that you took the journey.",

The violence was not too much for me, as is often the case. Though excessive in spots, Oldboy simply falls out of my range of enjoyment. As it stands, it is an entertaining ride with a disappointing conclusion that really lets the air of Park-Chan Wook's claustrophobic thriller.\r Shot in a way that makes the viewer feel entriely claustrophobic alongside Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-Sik), the film really does a great job capturing his anguish, loneliness, and torment, as he is locked up for 15 years for reasons unknown to him. The film's thrills continue as he meets the far too trusting Mi-do (Kang Hye-jung) and the mysterious Lee Woo-jin (Yoo Ji-tae), who is the reason he is locked up in the first place.\r The fim's willingness to dive into shocking violence is a problem, namely the tongue sequence. It makes sense, but no thank you. Other than that, the acting is well shot and well choreographed, especially when Oh Dae-su fights the men in the compound. A masterfully shot sequence, it almost made me a believer. That scene in particular is not just well shot, but Chan-wook Park does a terrific job creating tension and thrills in that scene, as well as the rest of the way.\r This is about where the noticeable positives stop for me, personally. My list of complaints is admittedly longer. Firstly, the beginning. Maybe I am dumb, but I barely realized it was the same guy at the beginning. I got what they were trying to do, but the beginning sequence of Oh Dae-su being very drunk and then winding up in this prison for 15 years was horrifically executed. It was incoherent and made no sense while watching it. I obviously figured out that was what happened at some point, but the film made no attempt to make it a coherent transition. Instead, it showed a drunk guy and then a guy locked up asking why he is being held with very little connection.\r Additionally, the biggest complaint is the end. Oh Dae-su is held for 15 years because he saw Lee Joo-win have sex with his sister and then he told his friend who spread the news around the school. The sister killed herself as a result (oh wait, excuse me, she was dropped). That is why this happened. Even worse, Chan-wook Park then decided it would be fun if the film became absolute nonsense by having Oh Dae-su have sex with Mi-do who is his daughter. Brilliant twist really. How did he wind up doing this, you ask? Oh well Lee Joo-win, in his endless quest to get payback for his dead sister, had a woman hypnotize the two of them to put them in situations where they will fall in love. This is not a problem with coherence. I understood it. However, these explanations were less than satisfying. I was already torn on whether or not the overall tone and feel were up my alley, but the ending convinced me that Oldboy was simply not my thing. For me, the ending was not just unsatisfying, but outright dumb.\r I get that everyone else loves Oldboy. That is fine. I did not hate it. I just would be hard pressed to say I like it. That said, the overwhelming praise will lead to me watching this one again later on. Though, it may be a while since it took me a while to watch it once to begin with since I was convinced it would not be my thing. Now that I have watched it, it seems that my initial impressions were correct. Though I loved the way it was shot and the action in the film is terrific, the incoherent beginning and awful conclusion is a major buzzkill. Sorry.",

Full of grand passions, bloodthirsty violence, with a wicked sense of jet black humor, \"Oldboy\" is a sadistic masterpiece. The director, Park Chan-wook, is one among several filmmakers who've made South Korean cinema what it is today, and requires a viewing at least once by serious moviegoers.\r The plot is utterly unique: Seoul businessman Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi), is kidnapped one rainy evening by parties unknown. He awakens in a seedy motel room  complete with hideously tacky wallpaper, threadbare carpet, a double bed, and a television  but in reality, it serves as a cell. Days, months, and years go by with no explanation given for his incarceration. A daily meal comes through a tiny slot in the door, and every so often sleeping gas seeps in as well. From the television in his room, he learns that he is the prime suspect for the murder of his wife  and now, even if he escapes, he's a wanted man.\r Fifteen years later, Dae-su awakes one day on a grass-covered roof of a downtown building in Seoul, outfitted with a finely tailored suit, a cell phone, and a wallet stuffed with cash. Before Dae-su can begin a new life, he must answer several key questions about his imprisonment. Only after he has these answers can he exact his revenge and turn the page. Meanwhile, his captor decides to turn Dae-su's quest for answers into a cruel, exhausting game that will push him to his limits. Additionally, he has just five days to not to only find out why he was held captive, but to also identify his tormentor, and seek his revenge.\r The committed performance by Min-sik Choi strikes a genuinely tragic note amid the mayhem and cartoonish excesses of violence. He does a marvelous job walking on the edge of insanity, while retaining likability and compassion from the audience. Superlative acting across the board, and a pulsating score to compliment the arresting imagery, while the true astuteness of the script will reward only on further viewings.\r \"Oldboy\" has a wild, twisty storyline on such an epic scale emotionally, and it rarely slows down to consider the logic of some of its most outrageous plot contortions. The revelation in the third act is a bit of a letdown considering the thrilling, ambitious set up. Cinematic in the extreme, the movie has an emotional core that will leave some viewers stunned, yet others disgusted. As tough as it is to endure  it is brutal, yet brilliant  and it is undoubtedly a work of art.\r \"Oldboy\" is the second installment of The Vengeance Trilogy, directed by Park Chan-wook, preceded by \"Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance\" (2002) and followed by \"Lady Vengeance\" (2005).",

A don't usually enjoy movies and get bored quickly if nothing intrigues me. The movie could make me sit for two hours straight wanting to know the reason why the abducted was locked for 15 years, which disappointed me.The movie tried hard to make you empathize with the abductor which does not make sense: He is a sick incest rapist who had was in love with his sister. The abducted accidentally watched them together while doing it and he just said what he saw. It's not his fault the psycho sister killed herself, she would do it anyway because it is a sick relationship.For the abducted to have his wife killed, locked for 15 years and hypnotized into having sex with his own daughter is too much. If I were him, I would just kill that bastard by beating him hard, pulling out his teeth and throwing him from the window instead of barking like a dog and cut my tongue.The movie surpasses the manga in every way so this is also a positive point for the movie.",

Old boy is the second movie of his revenge trilogy (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance - 2002, Oldboy and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance - 2005). Oldboy is by far the best movie of the trilogy and one of the best Asian films of all time. Drama, mystery and thriller are thrown in the film in equal portions, which is humorously violent and brutally funny.

Great cinematography in this story set in South Korea in modern times (The majority of the film plays in the times the film was released). The story is gripping and this film is one of those rare pieces that is genuinely able to make me despise the antagonist. The plot relies heavily on subjects such as love and revenge, but in a manner I've not yet seen before. It has some major twists that were shocking. The action / fighting sequences were the only things that were somewhat poorly done, with actors clearly missing each other while still pretending to be hit, but in the end that doesn't make the overall experience any less emotional.",

Chan-wook Park could have easily leaned on nothing but the action and the gore to grab the viewers' attention from the beginning. Instead, he knew that if there is anything that can attract the attention of the audience, and make them invested in the protagonist as fast as possible, it would be a thoughtful moral philosophy mingled with a sentimental story. That's how Chan-wook Park captivated the viewers from the opening scene until he evoked a catharsis in the audience at the traumatic third act.Flawless is a very weak, and unsatisfying word to describe the third act. It's simply look like nothing you've seen before, or even you'll see. With its twist reveal, to the outrageous and shocking visceral images, the third act is provocative, distressful, and utterly maddening. But nothing would have worked in it, and in the entire movie as a whole without Min-sik Choi's kinetic multi-layered performance.The fact that this movie didn't get a single Oscar nod, at least for Min-sik Choi's incredible performance, is as infuriating as the movie itself. For me, Min-sik Choi delivered one of the best performances in the past decade. Yes, I would easily put his performance alongside Adrien Brody's in The Pianist, Leonardo DiCaprio in The Aviator, Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood, and Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. But all that thanks to Chan-wook Park who allowed Min-sik Choi to show all his talent challenging him, and his pathetic, Dae-su Oh.What is truly impressive is how Chan-wook Park put us in Dae-su Oh's shoes by changing the tone, so gracefully, to resemble how the protagonist feels. The movie starts off with flashes of dark humor matching how mazed and lost the character feels. Then, when things become more clearer and clearer the tone becomes darker and darker till the climax when the movie became acutely distressing and dreary.Nevertheless, these tonal changes didn't work very well at the second act. Not because the tonal shift wasn't smooth, nor it came abruptly, but because that was the time when our protagonist, as well as us, discovering clues, and collecting pieces to get the whole picture. The whole act was very convoluted, for better or worse, but the thing is that the pacing was madly rushed resembling Dae-su Oh's confusion and ignorance. Not to mention, there were some sequences where we get to know about some very important characters, and some specifics related to them. Adding insult to injury, some of these details could be passed up, because they are simply not that important. The result is that the movie almost lost me a couple of times. I mean that I really lose track of some small details.Oldeuboi is a very powerful, thought-provoking, and visceral film, and that's because what it implies more than what it depicts. I think it's the first Korean film I watch, and it definitely won't be the last. Just help me with some recommendations, if you wouldn't mind! :)(8.5/10)",
