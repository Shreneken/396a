  "critic_reviews": [
    "It's done with an agreeable confidence and flair, the actors all fit comfortably in their roles and the effects are fun.",
    "Blessedly unimportant, Fantastic Four cruises along on modest yet genuine comic-book pleasures.",
    "A funky, fun film version of the famous Marvel superhero concoction, one of the earliest of the revisionist wave of supes and in some ways the most lovable or at least the most knowable.",
    "Frustrating because it doesn't seem far removed from a wholly enjoyable motion picture, but the tempo's off, beats are missed, and the production ends up sounding out-of-tune.",
    "I don't think it will seriously disappoint longtime fans, but it made me itchy as I watched it unfold in ways that the comics never did when I read them in the '60s.",
    "In a summer of low movie expectations and worse results, Fantastic Four is a not-so-bad mindless bit of camp escapism that doesn't try to eclipse its dime-store comic book roots.",
    "Michael Chiklis (of the cop show \"The Shield\") steals the movie as the agonized Thing.",
    "This clumsy, cheesy, chintzy adaptation, with its F/X that look dated the moment you see them, is like something left over from the '60s.",
    "A wildly uneven, sporadically slapdash action-adventure that amuses in fits and starts.",
    "This \"Four\" ain't so \"Fantastic.\"",
    "Even if you can get past the acting -- and in the case of the beautiful, blank Alba, that's asking a lot -- the film just sits there, not exactly torturous, but never very exciting, either.",
    "It's fun to watch superheroes who aren't quite at ease with their abilities, but \"The Incredibles\" - last year's similarly themed animated film - is livelier and funnier.",
    "Fails to be anything more than a mild summertime diversion. Based on the Marvel comic book, it's a prototypical air conditioner movie.",
    "There's nothing terribly fantastic about this ho-hum futuristic foray.",
    "It's a waste of classic material. Rent \"The Incredibles\" and see what should have been.",
    "Fantastic Four doesn't expand on, or even illuminate, anything much beyond the most basic theme of what it feels like to be an adolescent misfit. This is a comic-book movie that actually makes an effort not to go over kids' heads.",
    "A garish mediocrity.",
    "A comic-book movie unashamed of its roots, meaning it's unabashed about being silly, overwrought nonsense, which works to its benefit--so much so that you're almost rooting for it by the end.",
    "Compared with the psychological probing and spiritual brooding of \"Batman Begins,\" Fantastic Four is proudly dumb, loud and inconsequential.",
    "A colossal snore.",
    "Favors light action over character dynamics.",
    "The release of Fantastic Four marks the beginning of the end for movies based on Marvel Comics' upper tier of characters.",
    "After this mediocrity, no one's even going to remember Roger Corman's godawful bargain-basement 1994 version. Which, on second thought, had a lot more heart that this one.",
    "Fleetingly enjoyable in very short bursts, this is the most cynically constructed event movie in recent memory, its heart purely in its wallet. A fantastic bore.",
    "There's nothing remotely fantastic about this Fantastic Four.",
    "It needed a star like Clooney at its center, and a character actor like Alan Rickman as Dr. Doom. You don't expect realism from a comic-book movie, but you do want the characters to seem larger than life.",
    "Directing seems an unduly elegant term for what Hollywood hack du jour Tim Story (Barbershop, Taxi) does here -- the action scenes are so choppily constructed that their excitement disappears faster than the Invisible Woman.",
    "An overinflated B-movie with no grace, no subtext, no wit, and featuring beefcake/cheesecake actors who look like they've been plucked from the soaps.",
    "The action sequences reek of drudgery rather than adventure, and with the exception of Chiklis's remarkably soulful performance beneath 60 pounds of orange Thing makeup, all of the characters are flatter than their two-dimensional counterparts.",
    "The really good superhero movies, like \"Superman,\" \"SpiderMan 2\" and \"Batman Begins,\" leave Fantastic Four so far behind that the movie should almost be ashamed to show itself in the same theaters.",
    "A perfect storm of wooden acting, hackneyed direction, inane scripting and laughably cartoonish special effects produces a shapeless mess more wearyingly stupid than arch-villian Dr. Doom is evil.",
    "What the movie lacks most is a real sense of adventure.",
    "They take on special powers that the filmmakers are incapable of making interesting, partly because the characters are ciphers, and partly because the story is listless and uninventive.",
    "From less a purist's standpoint than a seeker of serviceable junk food, this comprehensive waste of time is too bouncy to be an \"Elektra\" bummer, but should make Marvel mascot Stan Lee think twice about burning another lucrative bridge with unintentional hilarity."

I've learned that a FF film was in \"development hell\" for some decades, so when it finally came out, obviously I rushed to the theater. And, I was not disappointed at all. Of course it's not as good as X-Men 2 or Spider-Man (the original, with Tobey Maguire), but it's good for what it aims to be: a sci-fi/action movie about comic book characters. You have to understand that the Fantastic Four are not as popular as other heroes, like Iron Man i.e., besides, their stories always covered the most strange, bizarre, far out things imaginable. And, because they are a family, there are many corny moments in the movie, but the comics too have those moments, then you just have to \"let it go\", to really enjoy the story. Overall, it's a very decent movie about very decent people. Relax, and enjoy the ride!",

For shame Mark Frost and Michael France!\r Plot is also incredibly underwhelming. Granted, it does work very well as a F4 origin story, a shame it didn't do much else.\r Overall:\rFantastic 4 is a decent, but flat, origin story. It doesn't do too much wrong, but fails to be interesting, aside from a few moments here and there. Worth a watch, but only as a rental.",

While a blind guy wearing a cherry red leather outfit might work on the panels of a comic book it looks silly on screen. (Not that this excuses the horrible Daredevil movie mind you) Mr. Fantastic (The stretching guy) of the Fantastic Four suffers this same fate. When he stretches it looks either disgusting (hand squeezing under the crack beneath a door) or quite silly (every other time he stretches.) Not that the character is helped by Ioan Gruffud's somnolent performance. He makes up one third of the most sleep inducing love triangle ever filmed.\r The lady in question is the Jessica Alba who looks fantastic in and out of her costume (She turns invisible when naked sorry guys. But some dutiful frame by frame DVD action will surprise the patient) but she expresses no emotion about either man (Or for that matter having superpowers. But I guess looking like Jessica Alba is kind of a superpower in itself). The third part is our pseudo villain Dr. Doom. (I say pseudo because he turns villain sometime around the closing credits in the most truncated villain performance in the history of superhero films) Dr. Doom as written for the comics is the perfect screen super villain. Which begs the question why he is barely in this movie and more importantly why he is a metrosexual evil businessman (Forced to be evil because his IPO went down in price and the bank is pulling out? Which shows a remarkable lack of knowledge how IPO's work) When Alba tells Gruffud she never slept with Doom we have to believe her. I have a hard time believing these saccharine characters go the bathroom let alone have sex.\r The other two members of the four (Evans and Chiklis) give competent if one note performances. But by the time all the introductions and back-story is completed the movie is over. With no villain, unimaginative action set pieces and some shaky special effects Fantastic Four is more mediocre than fantastic. Though there is that one frame of a not quite invisible Alba that is Fantastic indeed.",

Any Fantastic Four film has to respect the beloved characters at the team's core, the first fruit of the Stan Lee/Jack Kirby collaboration which—alongside Lee and Steve Ditko'sAdapting The Fantastic Four was never going to be easy. Any Fantastic Four film has to respect the beloved characters at the team's core, the first fruit of the Stan Lee/Jack Kirby collaboration which—alongside Lee and Steve Ditko's Spider-Man—revolutionized comics in the early '60s by introducing problem-ridden heroes. Following the source material means establishing four distinct personalities, getting the family-like team dynamic right, making sure there's action, throwing in some laughs, creating convincing special effects, and getting the origin story out of the way while still making room for an adventure. That's a lengthy checklist. Fantastic Four puts half a click next to a single box.\r To focus on the positive, Tim Story's Fantastic Four—the product of a decade of development, countless screenwriters, and several directors who drifted in and out of the project—comes alive whenever the focus shifts to the relationship between the Human Torch (Chris Evans) and The Thing (Michael Chiklis). After encountering a cosmic storm while working alongside Julian McMahon (as a business tycoon who spends the film slowly turning into Dr. Doom), Evans, Chiklis, Ioan Gruffudd (playing the stretch-tastic super-scientist Reed Richards), and Jessica Alba (playing the Invisible Girl) return to Earth with strange—and in Chiklis' case, disfiguring—powers. Chiklis becomes destructively depressed; Evans, as probably the least angst-ridden comic-book hero ever created, can't wait to take to the skies, show off for girls, and perform motorcycle stunts. (That last part doesn't make a lot of sense, but a trip to the X-Games provides plenty of opportunities for product placement.) Chiklis conveys a real humanity beneath his none-too-impressive monster suit, and Evans makes it clear that his constant teasing is, in its own way, an attempt to keep his buddy from plunging into despair. It's nicely played by both actors.\r Then there's the rest of the movie. The obvious product of countless revisions, Fantastic Four jumps from character to character and scene to scene with little logic and gives everyone but Evans and Chiklis a single defining character trait to go with their powers: McMahon is megalomaniacal. Gruffudd is dull. Alba is, well, the girl. Sure, the characters should be iconic, but they don't have to be living action figures. There's a spark-free love triangle between Gruffudd, Alba, and McMahon, and eventually, everyone starts stretching, disappearing, flaming, or clobbering as the plot dictates. Then the film ends with the promise of many more adventures to come. But who would want them? Not comic-book fans, who've been spoiled by too many good movies like Batman Begins and the Spider-Man series. Not action fans, who will wonder why the fireworks fizzled. And not the morbidly curious looking for the truly terrible film that the early trailers promised. Instead, they'll find something much worse: A garish mediocrity.",

Might not be a masterpiece or rival the MCU movies but is not garbage either and if you compare it against the 2015 reboot you will definitively see the qualities of this movie. The Fantastic Four have a long history in comics and were introduced in 1961. They have a lot of great story arcs and popularity even if it declined a bit over the years. Movie wise they have definitely not much luck but this here is pretty faithful and well made given the circumstances (just look at more modern movies that tried modernizing classic stories and you see what I mean) I know that hardcore fans will hate me for this statement which is somewhat fair to be honest. Story: Like I said this is the introduction movie for the characters. It explains how they get their powers and their resolve A group of 4 humans were doing / observing an experiment in space and when something goes wrong were hit by cosmic radiation. This does not have the expected consequences of radiation poisoning (Don't look this up as it is a nightmarish topic). All of them develop different abilities and have to deal with the changes. This is the set up. The story works more than it misses but while it is entertaining it is not a masterpiece either. I think they could do more here with the story and to a bit lesser content with the characters except Victor which is a terrible representation (but with a good actor that delivers). Lets continue with the cast. I think Ioan Gruffudd is excellent as Reed Richards and I can see him become as iconic as the MCU counterparts with better scripts. I am a fan of Jessica Alba since Dark Angel. I like her performance but also think they could use her character better. Sue Storm is an often overlooked powerhouse and this does not change with or without her powers. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm seems now so out of character since he became the embodiment of Captain America and nailed the role. I say he delivers but was destined to become something far greater. Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm is an interesting character an I like his performance. While I see a great performance their comic counter parts have more depth a greater stories. I will praise the support actors too. Now to the elephant in the room. I am also a fan of Julian McMahon and even say he does an amazing job with the given role or better said script. However Victor von Doom is not just an evil bad guy. He has depth and in a regard has hero qualities, honor and values. For example: When he took over the world in the comics he ended all wars, solved world hunger and turned the armies into emergency help forces. Not your typical villain and there is always the doubt that he is right while the heroes are too naive to change the world for the better. Also deply within he sees him not worthy of powers in a cosmic scale. This is just the tip of the iceberg as he has also quirks and weaknesses that make him interesting. Did I point out that he is a king in the comics and deeply cares for his people but even this is a bit flawed by his quirks? Back to the review. From the technical standpoint it looked really good back then. Be it special effects, costumes, make up and sets. Good performance in that category. Overall this is enjoyable but not memorable. The movie is nearly never brought up today as the MCU set higher standards. Worth watching at least once for me.",

The script is a little uneven, but the spirited performances make up for it. Michael Chiklis is very good as Ben, and Julian McMahon is enjoyably camp as Victor Von Doom. Chris Evans is spirited as Johnny Storm, though I wasn't hugely impressed with Ioan Gruffud and Jessica Alba. They just didn't convince and their chemistry at times felt a bit awkward. Also the story is a bit slow and predictable, though at least the characters were likable. Usually when the story fails the characters fail, though I felt there could have been a lot more development. All in all, a flawed but enjoyable film, that is not as bad as people make it out to be. 6/10 Bethany Cox.",
