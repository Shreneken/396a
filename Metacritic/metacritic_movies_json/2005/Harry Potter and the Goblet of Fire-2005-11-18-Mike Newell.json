  "critic_reviews": [
    "The best one yet.",
    "Newell puts his own stamp on the franchise and delivers the best Potter movie yet filmed.",
    "No, I couldn't be more pleased with what the screenwriter, Steven Kloves, and the director, Mike Newell, have wrought this time.",
    "There's ample reason to stay with this series. When Harry says \"I love magic,\" you believe it.",
    "Harry IV is an intelligent, visually seductive and mostly very satisfying fantasy epic of the first order.",
    "A mature, tense, frightening and altogether masterful film.",
    "Last year's \"The Prisoner of Azkaban\" seemed dark, but this excellent fourth film derived from J.K. Rowling's books is the darkest \"Potter\" yet, intense enough to warrant a PG-13 rating.",
    "It's not until Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire that a film has successfully re-created the sense of stirring magical adventure and engaged, edge-of-your-seat excitement that has made the books such an international phenomenon.",
    "Its look has the same grudging beauty that, once you get used to it, English weather does: It's so defiant in its grayness that you come to appreciate its conviction.",
    "J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter just keeps growing up. So do the Potter movies, in size, in ambition and in visual splendor - and with increasingly stunning results.",
    "Death, torture, humour and even budding eroticism -- now this is more like it.",
    "The darkest, most thrilling entry yet in the movie franchise.",
    "The film is more violent, less cute than the others, but the action is not the mindless destruction of a video game; it has purpose, shape and style.",
    "Goblet of Fire is the entry in which Rowling finally took off the gloves.",
    "The uncontestable triumph of Goblet of Fire, however, is Brendan Gleeson's Alastor (Mad-Eye) Moody, the grizzled new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.",
    "Whenever it hits its stride, it's a well-acted, vividly executed, full-speed-ahead special-effects extravaganza that puts as much bang as possible into every remaining scene.",
    "His (Ralph Fiennes) Voldemort may be the greatest screen performance ever delivered without the benefit of a nose; certainly it's a performance of sublime villainy.",
    "In the grand scheme of things, Goblet of Fire is perhaps closest to the original \"Sorcerer's Stone.\"",
    "Probably the most engaging Potter film of the series thus far.",
    "The film's quick pace and near-constant action carries you along quite nicely, and by the time Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) makes his climactic appearance, one can't help but look forward to the remaining films.",
    "By a pleasing irony, the parts of the film that stay with you are concerned not with the dark arts but with something far more unstoppable: teen-agers.",
    "Qualitatively different from its cinematic forbears: It doesn't linger on the gothic curlicues of its source material, it moves straightforwardly from place to place, and it emphasizes the emotional development of its characters with dramatic interplay rather than expressionistic, atmospheric gloom.",
    "With the cast getting looser and the mind games kinkier, it's hard to resist.",
    "Fine for people of developing minds, but the story so often stops its forward motion to take us on long detours into the land of CGI effects that it amounts to a $150 million magic show.",
    "Imperfect, but magical nonetheless.",
    "The best thing about the picture is Harry's new maturity: For the first time, he dominates a picture named for him.",
    "Goblet of Fire, fourth in the fantasy franchise, is the most fun and the most fraught with conflict.",
    "It's hard to beat the last movie, \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\" and this film is not better, but it has much to recommend it.",
    "Inventive visuals and funny bits abound, but the film's gritty look and unsentimental characterizations - Harry, Hermione and Ron are far from golden teens - ominously foreshadow the truly wicked shape of things to come.",
    "It's a testament to the power of the story -- and this engaging adaptation -- that leaving Hogwarts is tough anyway.",
    "Offers a brew of wondrous chimera combined with the wonders of human nature.",
    "A 157-minute holding pattern in which neither of the ongoing stories--Harry's conflict with the evil sorcerer Voldemort, the young schoolmates' coming of age at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft--progresses much.",
    "Kids may be appropriately terrified, but to this overgrown Potter fan, Voldemort, the Darth Vader of the black arts, was a heck of a lot scarier when you couldn't see him.",
    "Too bad the bulk of Rowling's humor goes down a black-magic drain.",
    "Terrific effects and considerable charm, but, once again, you can't help wishing the filmmakers had been bolder with the adaptation.",
    "To this viewer and reader, the decade-old juggernaut is as deeply felt as it is flawed, dense and illogical and laudably \"weird.\"",
    "Came alive only in the presence of a supposed dead man -- specifically, the nefarious Lord Voldemort."

As they head back to Hogwarts, there is another huge event that takes place called the \"Tri-Wizard Cup\", where they are informed by a newcomer called Alistair \"Mad Eye\" Moody (Brendan Gleeson) that no student under the age of 17 should participate as the contest and all the games involved are extremely dangerous and not for the faint of heart.\r All the other schools also part-take, but it seems that there is a strange mix-up as when all the students over the age of 17 place their names in the Goblet of Fire to allow them to take part in the challenges, Harry, who is supposed to be 14, has his name on there, somehow. A confused Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) then proceeds to let Harry part-take in this tournament, which is risky, but they have no choice, nor do they have any knowledge of who placed Harry's name in that Goblet.\r A reluctant Harry then decides to take these tournaments, but one day, during a deadly challenge, he comes across his parents' murderer, Lord Voldermort (a very scary Ralph Fiennes) who tries to kill Harry in the process, but luckily Harry manages to escape, unfortunately, a fellow student, Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) didn't make it out alive, making this the most intense of the series, the fact that a student died under the Hogwarts premises, does raise the stakes for all the students, especially Harry, at Hogwarts.\r This is a darker, more red-blooded, and violent chapter in the \"Harry Potter\" franchise, equally as enjoyable as its predecessor. The young cast start to grow even more in this world and in the Hogwarts world, the action and the \"Tri-Wizard\" tournaments have this style that keeps you watching. They have this sense of perfectly timed choreography and sure-handed direction (by Mike Newell).\r The best is yet to come, this is where the series has peaked.",

However, I thought that Dumbledore was far too harsh - um, why would he push Harry? - and I preferred the original Dumbledore. I thought that Rupert Grint was excellent (easily the best of the trio), followed by Daniel Radcliffe. Emma Watson has issues with her acting. Seriously. Why would you continuously wiggle your eyebrows when trying to show an emotion? Why? WHY? Its useless - i'm so glad other people agree with me. I would have given up on her a long time ago too if i were her acting coach. Dear Lord. Also, the dress. You know the one - purple, floaty, various tiers...absolutely VILE. I don't think they could have possibly made a more disgusting dress. In the book it is periwinkle blue at least, not pink/purple (which, in itself, I don't have a problem with. Just as a dress...) And why the tiers? Couldn't they have made something elegant and chic? Why does she have to look like a meringue that was tie-dyed??? Otherwise, I thought it was excellent; very amusing. Daniel Radcliffe has certainly grown up, hasn't he? Very nice. Robert Pattinson, Clemence Poesy and (can't remember actor's name) Krum gave excellent performances, as did Miranda Richardson (fabulous fabulous fabulous). I though Katie Leung was pretty good too, though I wasn't at all expecting a Scottish accent (which, eventually, I got used to). Mad-Eye Moody was very funny, but lacked the mad bit, especially for those who wouldn't have read the book (not me - I am an avid Harry Potter fan, but I know they are out there). Ralph Fiennes was excellent also; rather creepy as opposed to downright terrifying, as he is in the books. Then again, I suppose thats the only way to portray a wizard like Voldemort, as the sheer dangerous elegance is impossible to act. Snape as always gave the best performance (he is my favourite character); Alan Rickman can really pull off the cruel, mean, but somewhat good character (is anyone else having issues about believing Snape's Death Eater-ship? I can't figure him out. Shame we don't know anything about his patronus or boggart). All in all, the most enjoyable Harry Potter film, but the fifth looks excellent.",

But then, about a week later, I thought to myself that it was I was really looking forward to this movie as I was home for Thanksgiving break from college. When I did see it, I thought it was great due to the action and the special effects. But then, about a week later, I thought to myself that it was exactly the same way I had thought about Revenge of the Sith. The bottom line is that there are many flaws in the movie. Supporters of HP movies say that naturally, the movie will add things in and leave some things out, as it never will follow the book perfectly. That is exactly true! Except in TGOF's case, the things that were left out (little as they seemed) had a tremendous negative impact on the portrayal of the story. There seemed to be almost no continuity to the film. [***SPOILERS***] Rather than have a central theme like #1 and #2 have, and that #3 sort of has, this movie didn't have any! Rather, it seemed like a showcase of Harry Potter scenes rather than a movie that is supposed to tell a story. The obvious problem with the movie was the rushed sequences. It seemed as if we saw the first 200 pages of the book displayed in less than 15 minutes! Some of this is okay, but it is sad for other parts because we miss some very important things and we don't understand some of it at all. The most obvious example was when they showed the Quiditch World Cup, but no game. I was like, \"Are these story writers serious?\" Then, they rush straight to the dark mark scene with the death eaters parading through the camp grounds. The scene just appears out of no where, and for the person who hasn't read the book, they wouldn't have a clue what goes on!!! All things seem to focus around the triwizard tournament, which is an okay thing to focus the majority of the movie on, but it dominated the movie and forced special effects to be the only redeeming quality of the movie. Not to mention that the dragon scene took about 5 to 10 minutes too long and that time could have easily been used to fill in the missing gaps in the story. One thing that made me mad was the portrayal of Mad-Eye Moody. The acting was great, but it made the audience, even the people who hadn't read to book, to suspect him of mischief the entire time. No where in the book does it make him seem like a paranoid freak of nature who drinks from his hip flask every minute of the day. Just as an example of a missing thing, why the heck would Neville be so terrified of Moody's Cruciatus curse and nobody else? The writers don't let us know anything about Neville's parents being subjected to this when he was a child. Another example is the random part when Snape get pissed at Harry for thinking he's been stealing his polyjuice potion. That scene was so out of context and just confused us more! One thing that was just WRONG was including Barty Crouch Jr. at the Riddle home scene with Voldemort and Wormtail. We were never supposed to even see Barty Crouch Jr. until Harry Potter sees him in Dumbledore's pensieve. That got me skeptical from the very beginning. All I've done is talk about what should have been done, but offer no solutions as to how the movie could have been like TSS, TCS, & TPOA. Well, I could name a hundred little scenes that could have been switched around, added in, or done better. The most important thing that was left out was the second plot of the story other than the triwizard tournament--Voldemort's phantom but understood presence throughout the entire story. The only time we see or think about him is at the very beginning and in the graveyard. I had to explain a dozen things to my little brother who hadn't read the book because of this. For example, what happened to Bertha Jorkins? What happened to the plot that was talked about in the Riddle House? What is the significance of the Dark Mark? What is Ludo Bagman's (who is never even mentioned) role in the book? What is the reasoning behind Barty Crouch, Jr.'s trial? Why is Barty Crouch, Sr. never mentioned to be murdered by his son? Why didn't the writers put in the confession by of Barty Crouch, Jr. into the story at the end? This last question was the most important because it would have explained everything that the book told us about Voldemort. The movie makes it seem as if everyone accepts the fact that Voldemort is back, when Fudge (who is never even seen) should be denying it. In fact, this and the story of Barty Crouch, Jr. set up the most important part of The Order of the Phoenix because it makes everyone doubt Harry, and in the case of the ministry, cause people to make sure they believe otherwise. Another interesting the book has that the movie didn't touch on, which would have made the teen hormonal urges get more intense, was the rivalry that Harry and Cedric had. This would have made Harry much angrier when learning that Cho is going with Cedric to the Yule Ball. Overall, the movie seemed to do a showcase of the events in the book, rather than trying to be the book itself, hence the title The Goblet of Fire. In addition to the plot being confusing and entirely unfinished, the acting of Michael Gambon playing Dumbledore was atrocious to say the best. Richard Harris definitely was the best actor on the face of the earth for Dumbledore, but since he passed away, the writers should have found a worthy actor to follow in Harris's footsteps. Gambon was the second biggest turnoff in the movie for me. He did not match Dumbledore's character at all. Instead of being a loving, confident sage, he was an angry, uncaring, and confused man. His should-be consoling scene with Harry at the end is completely unnecessary, and does nothing to strengthen their relationship is the book does. Also, he frequent yelling completely takes away from the Richard Harris-esq Dumbledore we all love. With all of that said, I still give the movie a 4 rather than a 2 or 3 because most of actors did a good job. Ralph Fiennes (although he could have had red eyes and had a slightly more intimidating presence) was a great Voldemort. While Mad-eye did not act that way in the book, the acting was great. The 3 main characters, particularly Emma Watson as Hermione, are really beginning to progress. Hagrid was always great as usual! All in all, if this is how the 4th book was portrayed, and because of the way the writers didn't include the information that was crucially needed to lead in The Order of the Phoenix, I'm afraid for when the next three movies come out, if they want to keep making them.",

The first had a Another long wait for a new Harry Potter movie and another long wait in line to see it. The first three films were overall faithful to the books, and had some of the best directing, casting, and art direction of the decade. The first had a wonderful joyous quality (my personal fav.), the 2nd had a great feeling of mystery, and 3rd (aesthetically the best) was awe-inspiringly beautiful and gloomy. They stood just as great as the books (although in my opinion nothing beats your imagination, so the books will always win by default). Now, with Goblet of Fire I found myself constanlty asking why. Why did they take that part out? Why did they add in the extra action? Why didn't they emphasize on that scene? I think the movie was victim to a poor script and a bland director, but still survives on the great visual set up that past directors have built and the wonderful cast. I know that with a book so big, cutting out scenes and characters was a necessary evil. But why did they make Dumbledore seem viscious at times? Why did they leave out some very lovable and interesting characters? Why didn't they take some time to make sense of what was going on and why? It came clear to me half way through the movie that for once the book and movie are very different. The movie on it's own feet is perhaps the most fun of all the movies and will hopefully be a bridge to 3 much more susperior films. If you read the book the whole thing feels like a slide show (trust me, your friends will be constanlty asking \"why did that happen....what was that part about?), but it's still a good time and fun to see things come to life on the big screen. Anyway, it has Jarvis Cocker and Johnny Greenwood, plus Emma Watson is a hottie. Worth your money and time.",

Alfonso Cuaron reconceived of the series as a canny mix of the eccentric, the frightening, and the beautiful. His film is the one J.K Rowling had embedded in her story all along. Mike Newell, with \"Goblet of Fire,\" comes to the preceding with a patience long-eroded by television, or \"Mona Lisa Smile,\" or the sugar he might have compulsively consumed to \"brainmeld\" with the world's kids. His movie simultaneously feels repellently unmagical and drunk on the idea of magic. [***SPOILERS***] When Harry says, \"I love magic,\" he's stepping far outside the confines of Rowlings verisimilitudinous world to be cute. And that's precisely where this film fails. Rowling crafts a world where magic is the order of the day, every day.At times, it's so familiar as to seem frustrating, or absurd. This movie loves magic and has the special effects to prove it in court, if need be. But where's the life behind it all? Not in Hogwarts' paintings, or in its musty halls: Newell has done the greatest disservice of all by imagining Hogwarts as a boarding school- Rowling's starting point- and then stopping. Instances of the novel or beautiful occur at precisely spaced intervals- namely, when the kids' patience might start to wear thin. Speaking of patience, Newell has none to speak of. He has conceived of \"Goblet of Fire\" as a three-act drama. Everything prior to and including the first challenge is Act One; suddenly, as if someone forgot to mention it, the Yule Ball and, shockingly immediately thereafter, the second challenge are upon us in Act Two; Act three has no structure to speak of but contains the good, Hammer-horror stuff from the book, slapped onto an unbelievably brief third trial. Are we to believe that after the dragon, that's all the tournament would have for Harry? Doesn't old Voldy (Ralph Fiennes, for Chrissake) need to slow down a little so that all those long awaited curses can be uttered? Doesn't Harry's adrenaline flow compensate for his youth by allowing him to experience the most climactic moment of his life thus far without feeling that it's all far too ephemeral? The whole affair seems ingloriously rushed, and Newell has so pounded our brains with vain special effects that when the really beautiful image of the wand-beams meeting comes about it feels like so much more of the same. Yes, Potter stories require the sum of effects present here. But no other Potter film has so shamelessly rubbed them in our faces. It felt like \"Revenge of the Sith\" all over again. Newell, to be fair, does much better with the humans in the film; this Potter, even more than Cuaron's, seems populated by breathing individuals. Apparently, directing Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts puts one at ease with the lesser celebrities of Potter's world, because Mike here has done an excellent job capturing the mannerisms, rough speech, and conflicted emotions of adolescence; he seems more at ease when relaxing with his cast than when sitting beside the editor or parsing through thousands of effects shots. The episodic nature must be due in part to Kloves, but I liked his work on the last one (and \"Wonder Boys\") so much I'm hesitant to blame him. To close, Rowling's \"Goblet\" was the least magical of the series so far; Newell's is on par with Columbus's for that title among the films. It doesn't fix any of the book's problems, but creates new ones; thankfully, it's all very well acted (kudos to Michael Gambon & Brendan Gleason). The film simultaneously is tiring and needs to be longer (to compensate for the rushed feel), and needs desperately for Rowling's whimsy to save it from its dour self.",

Visually, this is a spectacular film. But visuals should always be in the service of a film's story line; not the other way around, and this film's plot was a shambles. The film had scenes and events that contributed absolutely nothing to the story., entire plot lines developed halfway and then rudely abandoned. Example: Harry's budding romance with some undistinguished girl that never either blossomed or died, but just sort of withered away of neglect, I guess, somewhere offscreen. Example: The death of ------, which was unnecessary and had absolutely zero significance for the story line. The worst violation of form comes in what was evidently intended to be the film's climactic moment: Harry's great encounter with the arch-villain Waldemort. This is a joke, with Harry and W. spraying streams of sparks at each other from their wands in some kind of an adolescent Wiz contest, then abruptly stopping so that Harry can exit stage left. Nothing ever comes of this scene; dramatically and plot-wise it is a big unresolved hole that the characters blithely ignore right up to the end of the film like the proverbial elephant in the room. Someone has *got* to be paying at least *some* of these reviewers for the inflated ratings that I see posted on this site. And the rest of you are, I don't know, some kind of J.K. Rowling sycophants. But, hey, the kids in the audience where I saw it absolutely loved it, so maybe I'm the one whose clock needs adjusting..

I like Hermione Granger, Cho Chang and Fleur Delacour they are so pretty especially when Fleur Delacour was in their Beauxbatons uniform and with the hat. The character that i hate is Viktor Krum, he always give himself that type of proud look and give other people that type of proud look, and he is like always thinking that he is the best in the world wearing the sports shirt and going out for a exercise at the hogwards beach and attracting girls and he always walks with the chest high up nag as if like hr doesn't do that it will be very disgusting but anyway he is the character that i hate most in HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE. my favorite part was when Fred Weasley and George Weasley drink the aging potion and putting their name in the pot of goblet of fire and when something happen to them then they started fighting that part was so interesting and somehow funny. but although i have a lot of comments HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE this movie RAWKS man sooooooo fun, interesting and exciting.",

There were many, many errors in this movie, and I believe that has been the worst movie yet. Though CoS was the least well-received, it stuck well to the plot-lines, and the major theme, and POINT of the story. GOF however, detracted completely from the plot of the book, and boomeranged off into the Forbidden Forest with unnecessary focus on the first task, the \"motherly\" relationship from Hermione, the Yule Ball event, and the Quiddtich World Cup. I am not saying that Quidditch should not have been in there -- but if the director wanted to completely cut off the game, then why not cut off the entire sequence in general, and have the Death Eaters attacking the World Cup through the Daily Prophet, while Harry stays at the Weasley's and allows the characters to develop personalities (something LACKING greatly). Moving on with the character development, let me just say this to Mike Newell, Steven Kloves: YOU HAVE FAILED! Not only were the dialogue delivered cheesy (ahem, \"I love magic\"? What the f.ck?), the trio seemed like people from Orwell's 1984. Hermione was this overly protective mommy, and yet, Emma Watson's acting never ceases to amaze us with its poor quality, makes it seem as though her \"love\" may be borderline sexual. Her eyebrows certainly tell a different tale. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore could not have been worse, if not, catastrophic -- it destroyed the loving, cool, grace of Harris' work, and made Dumbledore into a confused, blibbering, irrational, untrusting lunatic. The real dumbledore would have never pushed Harry into a pile of pots/pans/trophies. Though Rupert and Dan seem to be improving (not well, but working hard), Emma is simply embarrassing next to them. The third movie, Prizoner of Azkaban, was my favorite. Although Cuaron snipped off critical bits of information, altogether, it seemed like a film that followed a plot, a string of events that tied together, and smart dialogue that brought quirky humor (except for the talking heads) and subtle, yet blush-worthy, enjoyable adolescent moments (not like it overboard, and useless in GOF). The budding adolescence theme in GOF was overworked, and cutting some of it out could have been used to cover some gaping plot-holes. In general, PoA was an artful film, one that seemed like it was delivered by a true film maker, an artist -- NOT some bimbo who could only string a slideshow of events together. GOF deserves a 5. Perhaps even less. But I'll do it some dignity, as a Harry Potter fan.",

But when I watched it again and again the more I started to love it. Even though this movie also like the third one differs from the book but I liked whatever they did. The only thing I didn't like was the third task which is totally different from the books. Has no creatures or any excitement, but then the graveyard scene after that totally makes it up for the third task and all the credit goes to Ralph Fieness as our dear Voldemort. Story... What can I say!!?? It's Harry Potter, of course it's gonna rock. Acting... The trio remains marvelous, no doubt about that, but the rising stars are Ralph as Voldemort, Brendon as Moody and Miranda as Rita. They take the movie to a whole new level. Other adult actors are already perfect so i'm not praising them here. Michael Gambon sucked again!! In face he sucked more than he did in the previous one. That scene in which he runs towards Harry asking if he had put his name in the goblet is evidence enough for his suckage. Richard Harris we miss you!!! May he rest in peace. Direction... I found Mike Newell better than Alfonso Cuaron. Handling such a big novel is not easy but he has done an excellent job. But of course the main credit will go the Steve Kloves who is the screen writer. Even though i'd still say Warner bros should have never changed Chris in the first place. Since Chris is gone Harry Potter has lost smoothness. See lord of the rings, all the three movies feel ONE! This is not the case with HP. Visuals... The dragon was superb. The second task was superb. Voldemort's makeup was superb. In short the visuals were superb!!!",

I'm always concerned that book-to-film adaptations will lose a lot of the finer points of the book, but that's not the case here. The writing team very nicely trimmed the fat of the book and even enhanced it as they realized there are six distinct acts of narrative, and the rest is non-essential. The only noteworthy plot \"changes\" are that Barty Crouch Jr appears in the first scene, and the third task is modified a bit (no cloud, skrewt, or sphinx). No house elves either, so anything that Dobby or Winky did was assigned to someone else. They also chopped a ton off the introduction (gimme more Mr. Weasley!) A couple other quick complaints: Hermione is definitely getting around (Ron, Harry, and Krum all seem to be getting some) and Dumbledore has an explosive temper I don't recall reading about (Richard Harris is still missed). The leadup to and the Yule Ball scene were hilarious - boys and girls are so dumb at age 14. The new cast additions are all great: Mad-Eye Moody is magnificent, Rita Skeeter is correctly abominable (but underused) and you can't help but have a huge crush on Cho Chang.

I am personaly pleased with the fourth instalment. Director Chris Collumbus managed to stuff all the action in it while trying to make sense for all of it. However, he left out some unnessesary plots which caused unsatisfaction to certain people. As mentioned earlier, i loved HPGOF. It was fascinating and the computer graphichs were simply brilliant. I was simply awed by how the tiles flew from the castle roof when the dragon kind of clinged on it. There are also a lot of breath-taking action and wonderfull scenery. An adventure leads to another, it's as simple as that. I really enjoyed the movie very much, maybe it's due to months of anticipated wait. The celebrities however, play an important role in the popularity of the movie. There are, naturally, humurous parts of the film as a tradition, some from Rowling, but some implemented from Chris himself. It was really funny. My only complaint is, the lenght of the movie was too short. For a book that's that thick, it seems rather impossible for the director to minimized it to it's current state but he managed. Unfortunately, this resulted in difficulty in understanding the Movie. i doubt anyone would truly realize what is happening if he or she has yet to read the book. In my opinoin, the show should at least be 3 hours long, but 5 as a better option. He could have divided the movie into two episodes. By then people would not complain : Why no SPEW? Why no Winky, And Why No Sphinx? As a conclution, Chris has managed to pack J.K.Rowlings Fascinating world into an action packed film. This is the defining film for the whole series, a must watch for fans. It is definitely worth your bucks.",

This year, Voldemort's (sorry, \"He Who Must Not Be Named\") power is steadily growing, thanks to his servants, the Death Eaters. Early in the film, Harry and his pals are gathering at the Quittich World Cup. Quickly into the film, the characters are attacked-not by dementors this time- but by Death Eaters, Lord Voledemort's servants. (This part was very exciting.) The film moves fairly quickly, with more mystery than even the Prisoner of Azkaban had. Harry Potter is entered into the Tri-Wizard Tournament. How? We have yet to find out. Unfortunately for Harry, he has no choice except to accept what is in front of him. What also sucks for Harry is that people have died in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Yes, it's that dangerous. One thing new with Harry is that he is at the stage in life where he is changing. Hormones. More romance takes place, than it did in the others. For example, Harry seems to have a bit of feeling for Cho Chung. Ron gets jealous of his friends, because he can't get a date for himself. Hermione seems to have taken a liking to one of the other competitors. I remember Ron commenting \"Bloody hell\" when checking out the bodies of the French team. The movie generally is exciting and face-paced, but even if it has a length of 157 minutes, it still moves too fast for its own good. For example, they never tell us what a port-key is. (The audience has to figure it out for themselves.) The character, Cedric Diggory is hardly introduced to us. There seems to be no beginning the scene where the Death Eaters attack. It just happens out of nowhere. The movie never tells us why Ron gets mad at Harry. (It is because he is jealous, as previously stated.) Even if they took out parts of the book to make the movie shorter, they seem to have taken out necessary parts along with them. I did like the movie, but",
