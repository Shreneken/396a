  "summary": "When a music teacher takes a position at a boy's reformatory in 1949 France, he discovers the redemptive power of music.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "An enchantingly beautiful and moving film.",
    "A runaway hit in France last year and the country's official Oscar entry, is a well-nigh irresistible film celebrating the redemptive power of music.",
    "Extremely goodhearted, if not exactly original or exciting.",
    "Heartfelt, but not to the degree that it becomes cloying.",
    "Like all good popular entertainments, the best of it sings.",
    "A movie you've seen many times before, but the setting is different, its characters are well drawn and it delivers its uplifting message with succinctness, sincerity and skill.",
    "This is a formula film with panache.",
    "An appealing lead performance from its leading man and a wonderfully sentimental, if overly familiar, story line are the chief virtues of this French drama, a huge success in its native country.",
    "Larded over with le fromage, which is to say, French cheese. But as these dairy products go, Christophe Barratier's movie is delectable sentiment. Audiences will crumble into itty-bitty pieces of Roquefort watching this.",
    "The excellent cast in Christophe Barratier's loose remake of a 1945 Jean Dreville film ensures that the predictable, nostalgic ride remains enjoyable throughout.",
    "A crowd pleaser, even if it is unremarkable.",
    "It's basically just another watered-down version of Dead Poets Society and countless other inspirational-teacher films, but its emotional impact is undeniable.",
    "Like \"Mr. Holland's Opus,\" only in French, with an all-boy cast in white shirts and short pants, The Chorus is the kind of sugary, crowd-pleasing fare that only the most curmudgeonly moviegoer can frown upon.",
    "Does it by the numbers, so efficiently this feels more like a Hollywood wannabe than a French film. Where's the quirkiness, the nuance, the deeper levels?",
    "There's very little in The Chorus you haven't seen before, but the movie's depth of sentiment -- especially its profound humanism -- makes it worth experiencing again.",
    "Barratier has assembled an unforgettable gallery of faces both young and old, and prolific character actor Berleand plays the perfect villain.",
    "There’s little interest in probing characterisation, but the plot progress is steady and the performances likeable.",
    "In the end, it's a perfectly decent, perfectly vaporous film, pretty but slight, predictable but never incompetent.",
    "No stereotype is left unheralded and no heartstring left untugged in this freely adapted remake of Jean Dreville's mostly forgotten \"La cage aux rossignols\"",
    "The Chorus plucks desperately at the heartstrings, but fails to breathe new life into a tired old tune.",
    "The Chorus is sham art and questionable entertainment, but at the very least it sends you whistling out of the theater.",
    "A deeply conventional story about truculent or orphaned boys and the gentle soul who finds himself by shaping the tots into a chorus.",
    "A shameless heart-tugger from France, The Chorus leaves no cliché unturned.",
    "The crime of The Chorus isn't that it's corny. (I like corny.) It's that its corniness seems programmed.",
    "The film is finally a letdown.",
    "Might have gone down as an endearing fable, if only the route to its finale had been less cliched.",
    "Did nobody involved in this project notice that it was retreading a very deep groove?",
    "Unabashedly sentimental and just as unabashedly cliched.",
    "This kindly and spirited film doesn't exactly break the mold of the heartwarming, humanistic boarding-school dramedy.",
    "The movie is rotten the way that only a denatured made-for-export slice of Gallic nostalgia can be.",
    "The cinematic equivalent of filtered water, The Chorus is all smooth, nutrient-free clichés. This shamelessly globalized French Oscar submission even opens with a shot of an American flag--perhaps an unconscious declaration of defeat for importable Gallic cinema."

The Chorus is an awesome movie with nice acting, a great storyline and an awesome soundtrack. Even if the plot is a bit cliché (a very good man makes the lives of delinquent boys better with art), it is still awesome and beautiful. The movie takes places in the '40s, a hard time for the world, and it's greatly recreated, everything, from the clothes to the buildings. The soundtrack is wonderful, and the best part is that you hear the songs all the time because it's an essential part of the plot. I don't understand the low ratings by the critics. I give it a 9/10 and I recommend this movie to everyone that has a heart, even a small one.",

Faced with a true rebuke to contemporary Hollywood filmmaking such as Michael Haneke's \"Cache\"(the film that should've been France's entry in the 2005 Academy Awards), or Catherine Breillaut's uncompromising experiments in freeing explicit sex from the domain of porn-dom (that would be her entire oeuvre); they fidget, they sigh, they eventually leave their seats, unaware of their own dilettantism. \"The Chorus\" is about as challenging as a croissandwich from Jack (Jacques)-in-the-Box. The \"Lord of the Flies\"-like situation that greets Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot) when he first steps into his classroom is too easily dispelled in too short a period of time. These troubled youths are transformed into choirboys with only the most rudimentary hitches along the way. It would've made for better drama if Clement Mathieu had rehabilitated the pyromaniac with song, instead of Morhange(Jean-Baptiste Maunier), who looks way too good-looking to be of any interest to us. With all that fresh meat running around, Fond de L'Etang is made conspicuous by being an orphanage lacking in any religious training. As a villian, Rachin(Francois Berleand), the belligerent school principal, is no match for a randy priest. Ultimately, \"The Chorus\" is hopelessly irrelevant. We need another \"Magdalene Sisters\", not \"Mr. Holland's Opus\".",

The story is quite cliché, but it's extremely effective for the film, and it works wonderfully: it's a teacher's flashback passage through that reformatory. He immediately sensed the climate of repression and anger experienced in the institution, and fueled by the brutal methods of the leadership. Disagreeing with this, he began to educate the children in his own way, eventually forming a small choir that helped at least some of the young people escape delinquency.The film is very good and one of those excellent French films that is lost due to the lack of millionaire publicity and greater interest in European cinema. It's a familiar and friendly film, with uplifting moral messages and great music. Music works not only as a language to express feelings and communicate, but also as a therapy for the accumulated anger and frustrations of that group of children.The film's cast is headed by Gérard Jugnot, an actor I didn't know yet, even though the face is familiar to me, and I really enjoyed seeing here. François Berléand gave life to the villain, the unfriendly and rude director of the institution, but he does a very good job and steals our attention whenever he shows up. The character lived at school with his wife and kids, but I felt this was a hook for a sub-plot that never came to anything concrete. Kad Merad and Jean-Paul Bonnaire also proved to be good additions to the cast.Technically, the film is a gem of quality at a low price. Without the spectacularity and resources of the American film industry, this film offers us exquisite cinematography, with excellent colors and good camera work, an intelligent use of light and shadow, and magnificent and well-chosen sets. But it is in the soundtrack and in the use of children's voices that the film really acquires magic, especially for classical music lovers, as is my case. A note of praise also for the use of period props and costumes, which help the film to fit in well with the period portrayed.",
