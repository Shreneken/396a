  "critic_reviews": [
    "One reason for the fascination of Woody Allen's Match Point is that each and every character is rotten.",
    "Whether it's simply the change of locale, or a change in Allen's psyche, something is up in Match Point. With a dark view of humankind, and of the vagaries of chance - bad luck, good luck, dumb luck - the filmmaker has crafted a wicked, winning gem.",
    "Allen's most satisfying film since \"Bullets Over Broadway\" (1994) and his most compelling since \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" (1989).",
    "To call Match Point Woody Allen's comeback would be an understatement - it's the most vital return to form for any director since Robert Altman made \"The Player.\"",
    "An unpredictable, unusual, consistently engrossing drama of a kind that has almost disappeared from Hollywood.",
    "It's a sexy thriller, tautly constructed, deeply acted and heartfelt, despite a cool and knowing tone.",
    "The gloom of random, meaningless existence has rarely been so much fun, and Mr. Allen's bite has never been so sharp, or so deep. A movie this good is no laughing matter.",
    "Not only could one argue that this is the best \"serious\" work the director has ever attempted, but it's presented in a way that even the most seasoned Allen fan will have difficulty recognizing the iconic filmmaker's fingerprints.",
    "Woody's a master wordsmith, and here he's crafted a bit of audience-friendly fare that's smart without feeling exclusionary. It's a portrait of elite society--and the hangers-on who wish to penetrate it--made in an surprisingly accessible way.",
    "Allen, rejuvenated by foreign settings, makes us appreciate posh parts of England as he always did Manhattan. (Credit cinematographer Remi Adefarasin for showing us how seductive upper-crust London can be.)",
    "Match Point begins to recall Hitchcock as it unfolds, although it wouldn't be right to call it a thriller. This is still very much a Woody Allen movie, populated by upper-class characters who chatter about literature and fine art, frequent museums and designer boutiques and accidentally run into each other on the street with uncanny regularity.",
    "Woody Allen's best movie in years means to trip us up: Sexual sizzle. London instead of Manhattan. Brit actors. Dark humor with a sting that leaves welts. You bet it's a change. And it looks good on the Woodman.",
    "Its many pleasures derive from the way this drama unfolds unexpectedly from the characters rather than imposing itself on them.",
    "What fans want are good movies. This one isn't particularly funny or romantic, but it's gripping and tragic. It asks some nasty, yet profound, questions about human desire and behavior.",
    "Rhys-Meyers and Johansson work well together - they both know how to project glossiness and guile.",
    "Even for non-Allen fans this has all the appeal of a good story well told and capped with a deliciously vicious little twist.",
    "A sort of romance noir -- spruced up in pressed white linens -- this British-made film is elegant, uncompromising and oh-so- veddy nasty.",
    "Well-observed and superbly cast picture is the filmmaker's best in quite a long time.",
    "Allen covers it all with intelligent dialogue and unexpected moments of clever visual storytelling.",
    "It pretty much keeps its pulse steady, its blood cold and its nerves tamped down -- which, combined with cinematographer Remi Adefarasin's architectural Hitchcockian flourishes, lends a queasy, cool air to the proceedings.",
    "Match Point is fantastic to look at, sharply dramatic and Allen is--who knew?--a master of suspense.",
    "The movie is unexpectedly disciplined and enjoyable.",
    "Proof that Allen, who many have dismissed with his last few forgettable films, is still a filmmaking force.",
    "Allen's new movie, Match Point, devoted to lust, adultery, and murder, is the most vigorous thing he's done in years.",
    "An efficient genre piece with a few provocative metaphysical trimmings; the mainly English cast is effective.",
    "Match Point starts out crisply and deliciously, but in the end, it's a chess problem crossed with an ethics exam.",
    "One aspect certainly is remarkable. The dialogue is, at least to an American ear, authentic. Allen doesn't mention any aid on the script, so we are to assume that he wrote it himself.",
    "Switching into a dramatic gear, Woody Allen surprises but often struggles in this dark morality tale.",
    "Though the tale is told with crisp sangfroid and a wonderful twist, there's hardly a scene I haven't seen somewhere else.",
    "When they get to canoodling and conniving, you won't ask for your money back.",
    "Just when the seemingly endless scenes of Johansson's nagging threaten to sink Match Point for good, the movie becomes the thriller that early reports promised.",
    "The question that should be asked is whether Woody Allen has made a good movie this time out, and the honest answer is \"almost.\"",
    "Match Point may well be a return to form but only for those who love \"September\" and \"Interiors,\" movies populated by Bergman evacuees too inert and dreary to even crack a smile.",
    "Rather than providing a foil for Bill Murray in \"Lost in Translation\" or embodying the mostly silent model for the painter Vermeer in \"The Girl With One Pearl Earring,\" Johansson actually has to emote prodigiously here, and she is just not up to the task.",
    "Johansson bequeaths the welcome sight of a talent in full bloom to this wilted, dark whimsy of a movie.",
    "Match Point is a perfectly presentable, entirely unremarkable domestic melodrama parked queasily between opera and realism, two irreconcilable forms if ever there were.",
    "Match Point is a fatally neat exercise in detached craftsmanship, and maybe that's the best we can expect from Allen at this point.",
    "This thin chronicle of bad behavior among the rich and self-obsessed is above all painfully derivative, borrowing wholesale from Theodore Dreiser's \"An American Tragedy\" and echoes Allen's own \"Crimes and Misdemeanors.\"",
    "A modest and mildly pretentious mediocrity in the Woodman canon."

It's a very smart plot (normal for Woody), about a ambicious and smart tennis player, who uses his interest in high culture to penetrate the upper class. Chris is completely amoral. He just coldly calculates the probability of success. Woody plays well with the theme of luck (which is common in his movies), including two interesting scenes, one at the begginning, with a tennis ball touching the net  and luck defining in which side of the court it is going to fall, and another one at the end that makes you anticipate, wrongly, the end of the movie. Scarlett is gorgeous. Myers delivered a good performance. The movie oscilates a lot in its plot, as luck is seemingly defining the path the characters take, and the end tends to be not what you expected (unless you know Allen well). It is philosophical, entertaining, full of suspense and sexy. A masterpiece in my opinion. Dostoevsky would be proud, despite the alternative, nietzschean ending.",

Unlike the ridiculous King Kong, this film had actors with real dialogue and a director with outstanding skills. Although it starts slowly, it builds until it actually grasps its audience in conflict. You find yourself unsure how to resolve the conflict until a desparate act is committed. From this point, you finally realize that in life, it doesn't matter how good you truly are? All it takes is a luck and being in the right place at the right time; or sometimes, unfortunately in the wrong place at the wrong time. Woody Allen dispells the notion that good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people. Luck can be both good and bad. Absolutely thought provoking?

I was kind of muddling through this one throughout the first two thirds of the film, and was pretty unimpressed. It was kind of slow, kind of boring at times, and I agreed with some of the naysayers that the film was lacking any oomph. However, the end of the movie changed all of that for me. This film will hardly hold up with Allen's greatest works, but this was an extremely solid effort, and he took what could have been a completely vanilla movie and turned it into something my wife and I were talking about the rest of the night. No, it's not as good as \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" by any stretch of the imagination. But it is a good film by its own right, and is a very different film thematically. Here, Woody questions the ideas of luck, class, character, and opportunity very successfully. For those that say the dialogue is boring, I say you weren't paying attention enough to the story. There are several hints dropped along the way, and judgments are made about every character. The miracle here is that Scarlett Johansson's Nola, who at first glance seems like an airheaded nymph, turns out to be the moral center of the film. This film is a thinker; don't let the slow pace fool you. You won't get it if you're not paying full attention.",

The lead character was sympathetic, his dead protagonist unsympathetic, his death propelled by accidental rage and passion. Here we have an unsympathetic character who coldly plots the murder of his pregant girlfriend and carries it out. Why was this set in England? It is An American Tragedy merged with A Place in the Sun, inspired by Crime and Punishment, with a single twist that let's Liz Taylor and Montgomery Clift drive off into the sunset together.

Then, the question arises of whether one should commit to a relationship that is secure and content but unfulfilled, or one that is full of passion and excitement but doomed to fail. Another prominent theme was the debilatating effects of guilt, which not so subtly mimics \"Crime and Punishment\" (we see the main character reading this book in the beginning of the film) Quick summary: Set in London, Chris, a penniless tennis instructor is befriended by affluent Tom, who has a cluelessly happy and rich little sister, Chloe.

I was engaged throughout the story and felt (as I rarely feel) a delicious uncertainty of where the characters were headed. I was delighted at the crispness and realness the dialogue emoted. When Johanssen finally lashes out at Rhys-Meyers, I felt vindicated, and when the crushing ending arrives, I thought Allen provided a satisfying conclusion to an otherwise easy to follow yet captivating tale of fate, luck, and constructed destiny. I am a mild fan of Allen's work, but hands down, his decisions to let the camera watch the actors is essential to the success of the film. At times Johanssen lost my immediate attention, but Emily Mortimer was exceptionally consistent in her performance. The entire ensemble proved to be up to the delightfull challenge of Allen's stationary scenes and continual shots of interiors and exteriors. I was engaged, carried, and given a well thought out film. I appreciate it, and thank you Mr. Allen.",

It's not like any of his previous movies that I have seen -- except for being very good. It's true that the pacing is a bit too slow and deliberate in the beginning, but that allows it to slowly build to a stunning crescendo. I loved the ending. I also loved the always good Scarlett Johansson. I find it ironic that it took Woody Allen to cast her primarily for being Smoking Hot for once, instead of her usual roles where she just happens to be good looking. Whenever she was on screen the sexual tension was palpable. How some of the raters could say that this movie was flat or that she was boring is beyond me.",

It is no wonder that we don't feel too saddened or shocked when someone finally gets killed. We all know that it was just a cartoon character (and a boring one at that) getting killed, not a real person. To call this film a thriller is only possible if you have slept throught he first two thirds of the film which is certainly possible. The plot twists and philosophical questions that arise near the end of the film are interesting.

However, I found the lack of chemistry between the lead characters (Mortimer, Johansson & Rhys Meyers) to be.. well, extremely difficult to endure. That being said, it's rather surprisingly that I still quite liked the movie despite that massive fundamental flaw. Normally, I quite like Scarlett Johansson, but I didn't find her to be at all believable in this role and I think that she was horribly mis-cast. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Emily Mortimer's performances were only mediocre, and as I stated earlier, they entirely lacked chemistry. In fact, I think the only person I found to be completely believable is Mathew Goode. I think he made really creative decisions and added personality to a relatively small role. Overall, the movie lacked a lot, some of which it made up for in other areas. Basically, any way you look at it, it can only really average out as mediocre. I also found it to be a bit desultory.",
