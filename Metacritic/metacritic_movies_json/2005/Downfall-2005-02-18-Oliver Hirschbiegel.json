    "critic_reviews": [
        "Hirschbiegel and Eichinger, along with their large, brave and talented cast, have done something extraordinary for their generation of Germans, and for the world. They have willfully entered their grandparents' dirtiest, clammiest chamber of secrets.",
        "Downfall, whatever its shortcomings, bears strong witness to great evil. That is its triumph as a film.",
        "Against the overarching facts of his personal magnetism and the blind loyalty of his lieutenants, the movie observes the workings of the world within the bunker. All power flowed from Hitler. He was evil, mad, ill, but long after Hitler's war was lost he continued to wage it in fantasy.",
        "The first great Hitler movie.",
        "As Hitler, Bruno Ganz ignites the screen with every appearance.",
        "One of the best war movies ever made, Downfall is a powerful and artistically masterful re-creation of the last days of the Third Reich.",
        "In every aspect, his film is superbly made.",
        "A meticulous, spellbinding, provocative depiction of the final days of the Third Reich.",
        "A riveting re-creation of three world-changing collapses: those of the Nazi party, of militarized Germany as a whole, and of the F\u00fchrer who guided them into self-destructive ruin.",
        "It's a bracing reminder that before Hitler took power, it was handed to him. The lesson resonates long after the credits roll.",
        "From the very first seconds a viewer believes totally in Downfall.",
        "As a piece of acting, Ganz\u2019s work is not just astounding, it\u2019s actually rather moving. But I have doubts about the way his virtuosity has been put to use.",
        "Not so much a Hitler movie as a portrait of a totalitarian machine's spiritual and emotional collapse, Downfall is a cumulatively powerful Goetterdammerung centered on the last 10 days of the bunkered Fuehrer and those around him.",
        "Much has been made about the film's \"humanizing\" of Hitler, but he's only human here in the most prosaic of terms.",
        "It's the well-wrought details that explain, perhaps better than any earlier film, how an entire country bought into Hitler's genocidal madness.",
        "Downfall and Bruno Ganz are deserving of Oscars they will not get.",
        "Powerfully disturbing.",
        "Credit the great Bruno Ganz with creating a vivid Hitler: furious, unsteady, crushed and frankly cracking up.",
        "Indeed, Hirschbiegel himself seems reluctant to single out a protagonist, and finally settles on Junge.",
        "The reality it confronts is so gripping, we cannot turn away. This may not be the most sophisticated retelling of what happened while Berlin burned, but what a story it is.",
        "Under the harsh lights of the meticulously re-created, claustrophobic bunker, that scrutiny is relentless.",
        "Solid history, fine cinema. Downfall is gripping, moving, and, in the end, profoundly horrifying.",
        "Downfall's overstuffed melodrama juggles countless subplots and a small army of characters who manage to make an impression in spite of limited screen time.",
        "With a steely, unblinking resolve, Downfall stares into the abyss, but does not pretend to comprehend it.",
        "If I respect Downfall more than I was enthralled by it, that's because its portayal stops short of revelation. Once you witness Hitler's denial, the film has little more to say about him.",
        "This is a grim and sometimes guilt-ridden examination of the Third Reich in collapse. But it's also weirdly sympathetic, and not just to the peripheral figures in Hitler's twisted world.",
        "It is fascinating without being especially illuminating, and it holds your attention for its very long running time without delivering much dramatic or emotional satisfaction in the end.",
        "The very thought of humanizing Hitler makes me queasy. If he had a good side, I don't want to know about it.",
        "Has the arc of a Shakespearean tragedy, and all the essential components therein: loyalty and betrayal, conspiracy and delusion, self-destruction.",
        "A bizarre film.",
        "That's the problem of Downfall in a nutshell: It provokes insufficient emotional and intellectual responses to a grotesque and atrocious dictatorship. Instead of the banality of evil, it gives us the banality of banality.",
        "Intriguing, oddly banal and ultimately deflating.",
        "The movie itself seems more familiar than fascinating, more innocuous than inflammatory, and, at 2\u00bd hours, more tedious than anything else.",
        "Downfall may be grimly self-important and inescapably trivializing. But we should be grateful that German cinema is more inclined to normalize the nation's history than rewrite it."

The director successfully paints layer upon intricate layer of despair, loyalty, betrayal, joy, sadness, and delusion that must have been permeating in that small space. The one element that I think is missing, and purposely I think, is the idea of guilt. From Hitler to his henchmen, there is little attention to the idea that the choices they had made being inhuman or that they would have to answer to someone for their actions. Having been to Berlin, and having stood on the ground above that very spot where these events took place, I never once considered any sort of \"humans\" existing below that ground...only monsters from textbooks. This movie completely changed the way I view that now. I think it is often simpler to characterize people and situations in black and white or good and evil, especially those involved in such horrific acts. However, I think this film shows that things are much more complicated than that. Decisions and loyalties are based on much deeper and more complicated criteria than simply saying this path is \"good\" and this path is \"bad\". I give this movie a 10, although I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone. I would, however, recommend it to individuals that enjoy thought provoking films that don't rely on mindless action and typical hollywood movies.",

It depicted a delusional society being handed it's reality by force. However, it provides contemporary Germans with a way out. Now that the majority of eye witnesses to the third reich are dead, many german people can say, \" It wasn't my grandfather, He tried to save the children. \" Even Eva Braun's distant relatives can speak up. She wanted desperately to dance to swing music, in a sense of defiance. The riff would have clearly been banded in Nazis Germany (for being negroid.) It's possible this scene was included to poke a hypocritical finger at the allies, for having segregated races in combat. In an interesting way the movie concluded with Hitler as a man who made the most sane choice under the circumstances, poison yourself prior to shooting yourself, before the Russians pull your limbs off your body . In that sense he was facing reality which is a form of mental health, while those around him loomed in a circus atmosphere, which would define the rest of the society as crazy.",

The decision to portray the main protagonists as ordinary human beings makes the crimes perpetrated by the Third Reich even more horrific and incomprehensible than would have been the case if they had been portrayed as two dimensional monsters. The feeling of claustrophobia and impending disaster in Hitler's bunker is palpable, and the scene in which the Goebbels children are murdered by their mother is truly one of the most appallingly horrific and uncomfortable sequences you are ever likely to see, but it is used to underline just how much the Nazi philosophy had perverted the mindset of diehard fanatics, to such an extent that they were willing to kill their own children rather than have them live in a world without National Socialism.

They are candidates for the post of personal secretary to the Fuehrer. Among them is 22-year-old Traudl Junge, a fresh-faced girl from Munich. Traudl is chosen for the job and she is overcome with joy at the thought of serving beside her Fuehrer. BERLIN, APRIL 20, 1945: Hitler has retreated to a bunker system under the German Chancellery. Traudl Junge is asleep in her room, deep beneath the ground. She is awakened by tremors from artillery fire. The enemy is getting closer. Charting the last 10 days of Hitler's life, from his 56th birthday on April 20th, 1945 to his suicide on April 30th, the film uses multiple characters to show the chaos of a country coming apart at the seams, from Hitler's henchman under the streets of Berlin, to the soldiers and civilians fighting and dying as the Soviet Army ravaged the city above.\r You know that video on YouTube \"Hitler reactions to this\", and a lot of people may not know where that scene came from and it's this movie when it's during Hitler couple of minute rant and putting those reaction videos to the side this is a great scene if you can get pass that. I thought about bringing that up just in cause you didn't know.\r I what to start off this review by saying that Bruno Ganz gives one of the best performance of 2004 and probably my favorite performance of all time. Bruno Ganz got Hitler spot on and he delivered a masterpiece of acting. What Bruno Ganz did so well is add a little human to Hitler as you can see his struggle and I know we what to see him fail because his a horrible person but as horrible as he his he's struggle to win a battle that he started and it quickly going down hill slowly breaks him, at one point you slowly see him losing it and Bruno Ganz powerful performance that creates are powerful moment that we can feel a little bit of it. Amazing performance Bruno Ganz.\r The directing in this movie is what works the best as the director shows every detail of Hitler's upcoming fate. I forgive Oliver Hirschbiegel for directing the epic fail that was Diana the film as he made a better historical drama.\r For problems with the movie these not a lot to be honest, you can say it's kind of a snail paste at times with the pasting but that's really it for problems.\r Overall DownFall is excellent movie with amazing acting, great writing and directing and a brilliant historical drama.",

I found the cinematography lacking and the storyline rather mundane. While Bruno Ganz did a remarkable job  presenting Hitler as a compassionate man to those he chose to care for as well as flashes of the monster he was and his diseased mind, I felt the film also whitewashed those who served him and the crimes they committed. They appeared as proud, loyal soldiers, devoted until the end as any soldier is expected to be. Yet these men assisted in the genocide of more than 60 million people and no mention of their atrocities was every made. Also Traudl Junge was no child, she was 22 and aware of who Hitler was, yet she is portrayed as a pleasant, slightly naive, bland young girl. If you had no knowledge of history all you would know is that Hitler appears quite a being quite 'off' and everyone else had a strong handle on reality or pleasantly ignorant. I had a difficult time empathizing with any of the characters or even disliking any of them. It generally provoked no response in me other than irritation with the exception of the portrayal of Magda Goebbels. She was well played by Corrina Harfouch and I found myself genuinely feeling hatred towards her as I watched the film.

Doesn't explain much, but doesn't obscure either. Rather than develop the characters, the film successfully presents a tour de force of people clueless while the hell they have facilitated on others turns on them and savages their cherished beliefs. These people had assumed the lives of others as expendable, so their own lives do not merit our empathy, specifically in the days of this story when their world is collapsing and no one has a safe place to indulge in self importance. Yet a sense of empathy is provoked nonetheless, not because we care about these people but because of the tragedy and waste of their misdirected mindsets that could easily have been our own. The film ends with a sense of emptiness reminiscent of a bad film, but within this particular emptiness simmers valuable understanding that alludes to how the German people rose from their ashes. The acting is generally straightforward as it should be, with the exception of Mrs. Goebbels last hour with her husband and children - probably some of the finest acting ever committed to film.",

Firstly the good points; the acting is superb with Ganz's in particular standing out for his study of a monster, touched with just the right amount of humanity, swinging between delusion and despair. This combined with the great care which has been taken in accurately recreating the settings and consumes gives the film and harrowingly real feel. However the film is marred by the script bowing to convention and including a protagonist with whom the audience is supposed to identify in the form of Hitler's Secretary ..... The film wants us to believe that she was at the heart of events in Hitler's bunker whilst simultaneously suggesting that she was a picture of innocence and ignorance. The scene near the end of the film where she seems shocked by Hitler's statement of revulsion of the Jew's is utterly ridiculous and insulting considering she has been his personal secretary for two and a half years by this point. The final part of the film which shows a clip from the documentary 'Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary' where she talks of her apparent shock of finding out about the holocaust through the Nuremburg trials and how she as absolved herself of any wrong doing because she was young and naive (she was 25 at the films conclusion!), which is given to the audience without anything to question it as there is in the original documentary, leaves a very nasty taste in the mouth. Which is a shame because the portrayal of this one character damages what is otherwise a very enlightening and important film.",

For once we get to watch a film about Hitler and the Nazi's last days from the point of view of the Germans.

Instead, this film is about Hitler's desperation for survival or miracle as each day closes in for the end of the Third Reich. You will see how the most loyal soldiers are quick to lose faith while others remain loyal to the Nazi cause. The film also shows abit of Hitler's human side and his love for his country. The film is very emotional and perhaps a more accurate portrayal of Hitler's circle. If you're an open-minded person, be sure to check this movie out. It's certainly worth it!!",

Hirschbiegel carefully explains it through a fantastic performance by Ganz, which is described by critics and audiences, as the first portrayal of Hitler as a human being, rather than being a cartoon monster. It is great to see an impressing revelation of humanizing Hitler. He is kind to his female secretaries, loves his dog Blondi, and is always surrounded by his loyal associates. But on his next breath, he shows cold ruthlessness, dispassionate brutality, and mayhem, causing the deaths of not only millions of Jews, but also millions of other Europeans and Americans. But, really, he is a man trying to fight for what he believes. Downfall is a powerful tale of menace, sadness, betrayal, corruption, ranting, and the somewhat consequence of war for Germany.

Its a historical document in film, insofar as its absolutely faithful to facts and history. Hitler was a man with a magnetic charisma and personality, who manipulated people and created in Germany a powerful cult of the leader, through which he became almost unassailable, doing everything he wanted without anyone having the possibility of oppose. We can imagine this manipulative power seeing his generals shaking as ill-behaved boys in one of its most famous scenes. We watch everything: the dictator commanding imaginary troops, inventing plans and dream cities, but also directing, in a ruthlessly and cunning way, the few that were faithful to him until the end. The gap between the reality in and off the bunker and the general insensitivity to the suffering of the country is brutally glaring. The actors are illustrious strangers, to the extent that I have never heard of any of them, but the work developed is enough for the film to work very well.
