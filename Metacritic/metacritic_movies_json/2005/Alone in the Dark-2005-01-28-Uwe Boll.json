  "summary": "Based on the best-selling Atari videogame series, this film features Edward Carnby (Slater), a private investigator specializing in unexplainable supernatural phenomena.  (Lions Gate Films)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Since the film is based on the Atari video game of the same name, it also has much to appeal to headbangers: fast pace, lots of gadgets, monsters, explosive special effects, plenty of inscrutable plot twists and turns.",
    "Here is the horror-action genre at its silliest and most uninspired.",
    "Fans of the source material probably won't be switching platforms to catch this bizarre Lions Gate pickup, and non-fans definitely won't.",
    "Too lazy to play your own d--- video game? Lucky for you there's horror director-for-hire Uwe Boll, who's making a career out of adapting successful Atari and Sega games into tedious popcorn fare that's the ultimate in cinematic passivity.",
    "A fairly faithful adaptation of what a game is like, but without the pleasure of getting to play or the much-needed option of pressing the \"off\" button.",
    "Director Uwe Boll (House of the Dead) pulls off a nicely staged fistfight in an open-air market at the start, but soon loses his way amid mind-glazing exposition and endless gunfire aimed at bulletproof giant lizards.",
    "That this bit of pustulence is based on a video game of the same name is no surprise. It explains the thin plot, characters and abundant gunplay.",
    "Slater narrates as if reading a restaurant menu. Reid seems to have learned each long sentence in segments, so she wouldn't be overtaxed.",
    "Even Boll seems to lose interest as the story unravels. By that time, the supernatural cliches, plot inconsistencies, dead ends and red herrings have piled up so high you can barely see the screen.",
    "Director Uwe Boll (\"House of the Dead\") has made a cottage industry out of this kind of junk. Maybe it's time for him to close up shop.",
    "No better than whatever you might pick up while wearing a blindfold at Blockbuster, even if you happen to reach into a trash can.",
    "Think of the lamest horror movie you've ever seen. Now think of Tara Reid in the lamest horror movie you've ever seen. See how much worse it could have been?",
    "Alone in the Dark will be the worst movie of 2005. The idea that anything could be worse is the only genuine scare the movie has to offer.",
    "One of those rare instances of a movie being so bad ... it's still really bad.",
    "This is definitely for people who 1) love the video game, 2) think Slater and Dorff are eminently watchable, no matter what bad flick they're in and 3) are wearing industrial-strength ear plugs.",
    "Tedious, derivative exercise, stolen from a dozen or so horror/action films.",
    "An embarrassingly unscary monster mash, is desperate to frighten its laughing audience any way it can.",
    "So inept on every level, you wonder why the distributor didn't release it straight to video, or better, toss it directly into the trash.",
    "Brain-dead adaptation of a popular video game.",
    "Just Tara-ble.",
    "So mind-blowingly horrible that it teeters on the edge of cinematic immortality.",
    "Supremely idiotic.",
    "Just as the book is usually better than the film, one suspects the video game is probably more entertaining and coherent than the movie. In the case of Alone in the Dark, this is a certainty.",
    "Far be it from me to dismiss a man's effort (Uwe Boll) in a sentence, but the film on your teeth after a three-day drunk possesses more cinematic value.",
    "It's just the most inept filmmaking you can catch in theatres right now, or probably all year long."

I've seen two of his films - Alone in the Dark, and one starring that guy who was in Starship Troopers - and I have to conclude that Boll has no sense of empathy, no understanding of human relationships, and a childish sense of drama.

As such I expected it to be a lot worse. It's still a bad movie. The acting is terrible, the plot makes no sense, the action is too ridiculous for its own good, and for what's supposed to be based on a horror video game franchise there's no atmosphere or terror to be found. It's just that unlike so much of his later work I didn't find it painful to sit through.That's because this came out around the beginning of Boll's career when he was still making movies with the best of intentions. Meaning it's free of things like his genuinely frightening political ideologies, the toxic personality he developed in response to the overwhelmingly hateful criticism he received from his detractors, and the overbearing self-defense blanket of unjustified arrogance that only served to make his following flicks that much harder to watch. Alone in the Dark is just an extremely unsuccessful attempt at a big Hollywood blockbuster from a man who, while likely able to recognize a good film when he sees one, had no idea how to actually make one.4.5/10",

(very good console) and found myself transported to a dark and sureal story line with horror, suspence, mystery, and even religous lingo thrown in, and the survival aspect was best ever. this movie on the other hand had little to no suspence, the answer to the mystery was obvious, and the acting........ Is undescribably bad. there is no redeeming qualities in it. the story was nothing like the game, the remake was about the devil rising, and all of it was set in central park new york. the old game was set in a mansion. this one was set in a city. no central park, just a city. Is there anything that i can say that describes how stupid and assonine that is? The answer is no, I can not. And that's just the start of the crap, including the fact that it has the biggest loop hole in the world. So big that the grand canyon is a little crack in the pavement compared to it. At the end of the movie, there is a city that all the residents have been aparently eaten by the monsters. And there are no bodies, or blood. Oh my god. How does that work. If godzilla raged through that city, it would be destroyed. And there might be survivors, but there is no one there, and everything is intact. Great clean up job, guys. I am impressed. It would be like having a house of the dead movie with barely having the house of the dead. Wait, that exists. Okay... It would be like having a resident evil movie with no Chris Redfield, or Jill or wesker. Wait, that exists! What is wrong with movies today!",

If you finish it you're either a man or just stupid for having watched it in the first place. Take your pick. It could be both.Acting/characters: Well, I don't need to tell you how bad it is because you've heard it a million times before. The characters are very laughable and they have no motive for doing what they do at all. They make the stupidest choices without any reason at all. The acting is just as bad as the characters. I normally cut actors a bit of slack because bad acting is usually (not always) 50% a bad screenplay and maybe 25% a bad director who controls all of the emotions and acting choices of the actors. But that still doesn't change the fact that everyone in this movie acts as stupid as their characters are. 0/10Plot: This plot is as nonsensical as you get. You're expected to know a lot of things that you are never told. They attach significance to a lot of things without telling the audience why they are important or what happens if things go wrong. Do the bad guys want to take over the world? Do they want to just kill the good guys and just leave it there? Who is behind it and why? Is the main villain we see just some pawn or a host body or is he the mastermind of all of this? Why do a highly trained army of government secret alien defense soldiers never have to reload and can't hit anything? The plot holes are bigger than George Clooney's head when he won Best Supporting Actor (the same year this came out actually). It was just a mess. Plus the ending just added another giant plot hole to everything. Nice going. I looked on 5 or 6 different websites trying to get a decent plot explanation for this film. I found pretty much nothing. I did find this though. It's as close as we're going to get. 0/10http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/11343-aloneScreenplay: This was the worst part. The screenplay of this film made the acting and the plot very bad. There were many many cringe-worthy lines. I expected to laugh at a lot of the 'serious' lines, but they didn't even deserve that. They sounded like they were written by a drunk 8 year old. 0/10Likableness: Like I said before, the plot was stupid, the acting was bad, and the screenplay was horrid too. I expected to come in at least laughing at the lines and getting entertainment value that way, but I didn't. Plus the special effects were some of the worst I've seen in a long time. I wouldn't suggest this one (although I don't mind that Irukandji suggested this one to me). It's fun to bash films like this. They certainly deserve it. 0/10Final score: 0/40 (H)TRIVIA TIME: 1. The lengthy opening text crawl was added after numerous test audience members said they were confused by the plot.2. After execs read the green draft of the shooting script, the film got an additional $10 million. Uwe Boll poured the money into special effects.3. Every piece of body armor worn by the various extra foot soldiers during major battle scenes is paintball body protection made by JT USA.4. Nuclear Blast spend $30,000 on the soundtrack rights to promote their bands.",

The movie doesn't even try to use the source material, instead going for something that shouldn't even exist. I mean, they went as far as to have a dead person get up again, and even animating bullets missing people WHO SAID BULLET JUST KILLED. What really takes the cake is the non existing storyline, pre-into to acting actors, and a gods awe-full music score. In fact, I'm sure the only reason that Uwe Boll made this movie, was so that he could exploit a loop hole and use it as a tax write off, so that he gets paid a lot of money in compensation. And this isn't the first time he's done this to a video game. Seriously, avoid at all costs, even if those costs are vital organs, loved ones, or having to be wide awake for a root canal, in a truck, in a high speed chase being preformed by Orin Scrivello.",

Uwe Boll is a legendary director. He is famous for making some of the worst movies in recent history, using a German tax shelter to fiance his movies (German stupid money was the applied term) and challenging his critiques to a boxing match including inviting Quentin Taratino and Roger Avary. It was called ‚ÄúPut up or shut up‚Äù. He took 5 challengers and defeated them all by beating them all up. One was even an amateur boxer with some skills / experience (Uwe Boll also is an amateur boxer and has lot of years of training on his resume). This was the stuff of legends and you will find it on YouTube (Uwe Boll boxing). Back to the movie. The movie is loosely based on the really good ‚ÄúAlone in the Dark The new Nightmare‚Äù videogame. You get what you expect. His movies have no good stories, acting or coherence. The only decision for you is if it is just really bad or so bad that it is entertaining. For me I enjoyed this movie while I must admit that it is a guilty pleasure. I should have not rated this above a 3 and even that is maybe to good. Overall a silly and enjoyable movie. I must say that I respected Uwe Boll and say you should learn from him because he had success. Machiavelli said something like ‚ÄúLearn from the sucessful people no matter if you like or dislike them because they know the game‚Äù.",

Sceanrio is disparate, inconsistent, impossible to clearly understand. Lighting is remarkably awful: 80% of the scenes are shot in almost total darkness. All protagonists are unattractive and have this strange emotionless acting. Decors and environments are terrible, and espacially the costumes since Boll used paintball armors to equip policemen. Music and sound effects are horrible and incoherent too. Dialogues are dull and flat. There is absolutely no link between the actual movie title, the eponymous video game and the plot of the movie. Who could have bet on the fact that a movie called 'Alone In the Dark' would show dozens of warriors against thousands of creatures? No one is actually alone, even if we are actually in the dark all along.Only good point I found is that special effects on creatures are not that bad. However I can't say the same for special effects on deaths. A few (and only a few) frames and scenes are actually inspired. It deserves a 2/10 because of this and because this film does not have the real petty intention towards us. We have much to learn from the countless mistakes it makes.",
