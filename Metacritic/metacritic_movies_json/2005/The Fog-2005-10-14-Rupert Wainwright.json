  "summary": "There really is something out there in the dark. In the small town of Antonio Bay, a terrifying and malevolent force hidden within a thick and eerie fog terrorized its residents. Shrouded by the fog lies a ghastly secret of merciless revenge, one that the town's inhabitants would do well to unravel -- before it's too late.  (Revolution Studios)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "This new Fog floats in on the fumes of the 1980 John Carpenter original, but the surprise is that it's arguably better.",
    "It's virtually indiscernible from any other contemporary horror film except for, well, the fog.",
    "The production values are above par, but as in Carpenter's original, seeing ghosts is less scary than imagining them.",
    "Mildly scary here and there. It does not play by all the horror movie rules (e.g., the black guy always dies first). And the cast is good-looking.",
    "Director Rupert Wainwright fails to bring any style to the material, not producing a fraction of the suspense or wit generated by Carpenter in the original even while working with a far lesser budget.",
    "Unfortunately, interest lags between the grisly deaths, and, worse, none of the characters generates rooting interest.",
    "Nothing comes together after the first ten minutes.",
    "If the characters were more interesting, the long, long buildup to their night of ghostly reckoning might be suspenseful rather than tedious.",
    "Most of The Fog will seem drearily perfunctory even to those viewers who don't know Carpenter's version, which itself emulated the elegant gloom of Val Lewton's horror pics of the 1940s.",
    "Less fun than \"Cry_Wolf\" and \"Venom,\" if that's possible.",
    "Making concessions at every turn to the youth-horror market, the film slashes the ages of its protagonists by some 15 years, and its IQ follows suit.",
    "The fog also does something genuinely eerie: It causes everyone in the cast to deliver dreadful performances and display inappropriate reactions when their friends are drowned, burned, stabbed or thrown into glass display cases.",
    "I was held in suspense throughout The Fog, aching to learn the answer to its central riddle: Why would any one remake such a crummy movie?",
    "Selma Blair, the one vibrant actress in a cast of colorless screamers (including Tom Welling from Smallville and Maggie Grace from Lost), takes Adrienne Barbeau's old role.",
    "It's too mediocre (and PG-13) to be classified as a horror film, too inane to be taken seriously and too uninteresting to be bothered with.",
    "Such a monumentally bad remake of such an exceptionally chilling genre favorite."

In the first film, the settlers took advantage of the fog to lure Blake and his crew into a trap on the rocks, hence their symbolic return IN the fog.  In this remake, their ship was raided and set on fire.  Where's \"The Fog\" in that?",

And I thought The Skeleton Key was bad....The horror genre's really gone downhill in the last year. The Fog seemed like a made for TV movie rather than something that should have went on the big screen. With a cast made up of mostly people from TV, and with a director whose most recent works include MC Hammer music videos, clearly the producers and studio were not too confident about the quality of this script. (from the person who co-wrote The Core.) And for good reason. This movie's script is terrible. Everything from the unbelievable situations and the dialogue to the bland, no-peronality characters, to the lame PG-13 violence, to the lack of scares and poor pacing, just destroys the movie. There is a plot in here somewhere, but it's so bad that I can't even describe it to you. (It's not even revealed until the last 20 minutes of the movie anyway.) It seems to take forever for the fog to even show up, and until then, we're forced to watch these characters do nothing of interest for a long time. And when the fog does show up, we are thrown so many horror cliche's that it's a bit unbelievable. Everything from \"OH NO! THE CAR'S NOT STARTING!\" to the \"monster coming out of the garbage disposal\" and the \"person on the autopsy table coming alive\" is done here, making each and every scare very predictable. This movie was not screened for critics, and the word of mouth hasn't been good, so it was with ZERO expectations that I went into this movie. I expected it to be stupid, but I also expected AT LEAST something eerie that would scare me a few times over the 100 minutes of this movie's run time. But even with no expectations except for a \"dumb but scary horror film\" I ended up disappointed. This movie wasn't remotely scary, the pacing was terrible, and overall, the movie was just boring. Do not see this movie for any reason.",

The original fog, although not Carpenter's best work, still maitained his trademark suspense and mystery. It was As an avid fan of Carpenter's work It is hard for me to admit the painful truth......this remake is a dreadful mistep. The original fog, although not Carpenter's best work, still maitained his trademark suspense and mystery. It was the core simplicity of the story that made the whole thing work. What lives in the fog? Why is it overtaking the town? It was what you didn't see, what you didin't know that made the whole thing scary. In this bloated remake the filmmakers apparently confused re-interpretation with \"over explanation\". Filling the story with more details and characters does not make the film better only more literal, hence less mysterious and drowns the viewer in information that makes it feel more like a history lesson then a journey into horror,. There were so many things that made the original eerie and to see those elements discarded for rock music, special effect gimmicks, gratuitous sex scenes and shallow attempts at screen tragedy only re-affirms that horror is an art best left to professionals. If one remembers Hallloween.....what made that film work was not what we knew but what we didn't know. Yes Mike Meyers killed his sister, yes he stared out the window for over 15 yesar plotting his return. But what was behind those eyes, what was in his mind, what was driving him and more importantly was he even human anymore? It was these unknowns, these things that implied that there was an evil in him greater than himself that made it scary. Now imagine if I explained why he killed his sister, what his plan was, why he was seeminly invincible. And not only did I tell you this but I told you this before the end of the film, in the middle of the film. This is essentially what the Fog does. Not even the brilliant eeriness of Carpenters original music is spared or respected. In its place we get pop music segways, a painfully redundant mood soundbyte that rears it's ugly head whenever it has a chance. In hopes of creating a spookiness that the scene cannont muster on its own. What's most suprising is that Carpenter and Debra Hill both produced this remake. Which means they consciously contributed to the slaughtering of their own original material. I wonder how they felt when they saw the rough cut and realized that they had a stilnker on their hands. Perhaps too much time has gone by and they feel they have lost touch with what the young audience considers scary. If so let me re-asure them that they had it right the first time and if they plan to make anymore remakes to please trust in the craftmanship and aesthetics of their prior work. I mean Carpenter pretty much single-handedly invented the modern day slasher film with Halloween. If he doesn't have the right instincts for horror....I don't know who does. In the meanwhile, spare yourself the horror of seeing this film and rent the original instead. When you see the remake on Cable in about 2 months you'll thank me for it.",

When I first saw this I wondered what a sequel to the Fog would be like and I went with the remake. I felt this movie stayed close to the original but it also had more content( I thought the sexual innuendo was a bit much though). Basically, alot of the stuff that was done in this film was the kind of things that Carpenter really didn't have that type of f/x to pull off in the late 70's. Also, I really don't like it when most people hate this movie simply because this movie is a remake. I just have to say that no movie, granted it be a remake or a sequel, will never ruin the reputation of the original film its based on hit or miss. Reviewers (like most of the reviewers on IMDB) compare this movie to the House of Wax remake and the only reason that film was terrible was because you have Paris Hilton being the center of attention and the rest of the cast is just built around her and that it ignored the original thriller that starred Vincent Price and turned it into some cheap Texas Chainsaw Massacre knock-off. So in conclusion I feel remakes are ment to be a different movie altogether (and with the original director's permission no doubt) and should be taken as more of a follow up to the original rather than trying to ignore its source and feel close to that but always keep the original in mind. I'll just wait for the film to be released on DVD and I may rent and/or buy it rated or unrated.",

Honestly the only thing this director seems to have a grasp of is filming ships docking and people being thrown through windows (which becomes so frequent that it is hillarious as the film progresses). The editing is so dizzying and sudden that you'll swear you just suffered severe whiplash, as the movie switches violently from, say, a guy getting his eye knifed to two fun lovin' teens at Starbucks. The whole resurgence of horror movies (really, really bad horror movies) at theaters has been fun at points (everything by Uwe Boll, for example) but now it's getting to the point that it's just embarassing and boring.
