  "summary": "The story of the young Johnny Cash and his incendiary love affair with June Carter Cash come to life in Walk the Line.  (20th Century Fox)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Walk the Line superbly combines music and two of the year's most riveting performances to tell one of the screen's great love stories.",
    "What Phoenix and Witherspoon accomplish in this movie is transcendent. They act with every bone and inch of flesh and facial plane, and each tone and waver of their voice.",
    "Witherspoon has nailed it before, notably in \"Election,\" but her portrayal of June is astounding in its vitality and richness.",
    "What adds boundless energy to Walk the Line is the performance by Reese Witherspoon as June Carter Cash.",
    "A Johnny Cash biopic equally packed with music and frustrated love, Walk the Line goes from compelling to enthralling.",
    "It's a celebration of the good times and bad times shared by a man and woman who found each other in the middle of some historic craziness, and it rocks.",
    "The film sends you home moved and in a tuneful mood.",
    "A big, juicy, enjoyable wide-canvas biography with a handful of indelible moments.",
    "The movie is entertaining, reasonably true to the facts of its subject's life and full of music.",
    "In spite of its standard biopic gaps and simplifications, Walk the Line gets the big things right.",
    "As the star-crossed couple, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon contribute all their own vocals, and their soapier scenes together reminded me of no less than the 1954 \"A Star Is Born.\"",
    "I suspect many Cash fans will think it's too conventional. But I think its conventionality is part of its power.",
    "Witherspoon's June is a pistol - a sugar-rush of screwball energy and cornball Southern sass that's meticulously earthed with grace notes of sadness.",
    "Mangold, Phoenix, and Witherspoon, all excellent in their roles.",
    "This movie has a driving plotline that \"Ray\" lacked - a love story. To me, that's what elevates this film.",
    "It doesn't matter much that Phoenix and Witherspoon sound more like Phoenix and Witherspoon than Cash and Carter. The chemistry is there. The actors walk their own line, successfully.",
    "Cash was a true anomaly: a poseur who was also the genuine article. A better movie would have made that contradiction its core.",
    "Conventional to the core but gets a blast of pure, hard-driving energy from Joaquin Phoenix's and Reese Witherspoon's vividly realized performances.",
    "Cash made some untamed, exhilarating sounds in its formative days. Walk the Line is strongest when it shows him in love with either his music or his muse.",
    "The best moments in Walk the Line are the plentiful musical sequences, from Cash's initial foray into the Sun Records studio in Memphis, to his nights performing in high school auditoriums alongside the likes of Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis, to his landmark concert at Folsom Prison in 1968, where his dangerous, edgy persona was cemented.",
    "What Walk the Line does well, it does really well. Mangold was ­wisely gen­erous with the amount of musical performance he included in the film, and the later scenes - showing Cash and Carter as partners - are so well shot and edited, they defy you to sit still.",
    "It's frustrating that a movie about a man so deathly serious about music has largely boiled his life down to addiction and adultery.",
    "A passionate, chronicle of an extraordinary artist, and a love story that can't be beat.",
    "Thanks to the movie's very clear respect for Cash and his music, and thanks mostly to the two superb, heartfelt performances by Reese Witherspoon as Carter and Joaquin Phoenix as Cash, Walk the Line eventually earned my sympathy.",
    "Walk the Line is a strongly acted, musically vibrant, conventionally satisfying biopic of country/rock/blues legend Johnny Cash and his second wife, June Carter.",
    "An engaging biopic that would totally lack surprise were it not for Reese Witherspoon, and a healthy touch of ambivalence about the populist myth that bound The Man in Black to his adoring public.",
    "The decision to approach Johnny's life as a love story causes Mangold to neglect the development of Johnny's music.",
    "The movie is less an uncharted journey than a 2 p.m. bus tour of a music industry legend. But like an expert guide, Mangold shepherds the story with enough grace, energy and skill to make it worthwhile.",
    "The problem is that the movie plays down almost everything that made Cash great: the train rumble of a voice, the direct, poetic truth of his best lyrics, the invention of his outlaw image and his constant creativity.",
    "There are too many musical performances in this movie, even for a country fan such as myself, to keep the city slickers engaged. This bespeaks great faith in the charisma of the stars, who merit it. They also, however, deserved a better script.",
    "I couldn't imagine anyone better suited to play the role. But this movie is a lot less interesting than it might be. Though it's not bad--in fact, it's rather sweet--it's too simple a portrait of a very complicated and calculating entertainer.",
    "Unfortunately, for all its good music and admirable vocal impersonations, Walk the Line slides -- very, very slowly -- downhill.",
    "Cash is a legend, and deserving of a more thoughtful portrayal than what we’re offered here.",
    "This Man in Black is, frankly, a bit of a wuss. As a love story, Walk the Line can seduce. As a biopic, it treads awfully familiar Overcoming Adversity turf.",
    "In no way obsessive, Walk the Line is more sincerely--which is to say, more boringly--sincere. It doesn't leave you with much to think about, except maybe the empty vibrato of effective ventriloquism.",
    "Ends up being another one of those life-of-an-entertainer films that reduces an artist to his most embarrassing moments.",
    "For all the affection Mangold feels for Cash and Carter, the movie feels oddly dispassionate.",
    "There is no way a feature-length movie could do justice to such bounty, and Walk the Line settles for the minimum."

Joaquin Phoenix steps into the famed singer's shoes, and does an emotionally satisfying and shockingly accurate rendition of the Man in Black.\rThe film then seemingly transforms into a flashback, as Johnny thinks back to his days as a Christian child, not at all the favourite son of his discipline happy dad, he often listens to bible tunes on the radio, to the dismay of his father.\rAfter a tragic accident, we see a grown up Johnny joining the army, and he spends most of his free time writing songs, mainly things that seem to annoy him or that are constantly on his mind. He soon returns home to a wife and a life not quite what he had hoped for as a door to door salesman, he happens upon a recording studio run by Sam Philips (Dallas Roberts) who convinces Johnny to sing something of his own, simply telling him that people don't want to hear bible music....and so begins the unforgettable career of the legend.\rJoaquin Phoenix delivers his most memorable and certainly the most close to life of any biopic tale of Cash, combining his rusky voice with the charm and charisma of the real thing. His struggles with the beautiful June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) are chronicled in this excellent tale of a complex trial and error story, one which shot Cash to the highest stardom of his life but one which also made him face his darkest demons.\rWe watch as the celebrity stigma with Cash perhaps becomes too much, and he begins to delve in the narcotic way of life, eventually destroying his marriage and possible his career.\rAll the songs that made him as we know him today are present, and Phoenix couldn't be more on par with the man he is portraying, it is sometimes a pinch yourself moment just to make sure you are listening to the real thing,\rWhat truly leaks from this picture is Cash's attempt to constantly make his dad proud, something he never seems to get, and perhaps the reason behind his spiral out of control.\rA truly powerful and exhilarating biopic that cannot be missed, showing the life of one of the most charismatic, egotistical yet brilliant musicians of all time, Johnny Cash.",

The best part about this film is Reese Witherspoon's performance as June Carter, although ironically she seems to have a more polished voice than June but she still captures her character and her love for Johnny. The film ends on a romantic vibe which makes you forget about the adultery, heartache and drug use that had to happen before. It covers a lot of deep and heavy topics but the soundtrack and the tour sequences keep the film on an upbeat and feel good beat. Definitely an all time favourite!",

After reading Johnny Cash's autobiography 'Man In Black' it is easy to spot very obvious flaws in the movie. For one thing, Johnny Cash described his father as a good natured, good humoured, loving and dignified man who even preached one Sunday morning at thier church. The movie, however, portrays Ray Cash as a gruff , abusive, contemptuos tyrant. The movie didn't do June Cater justice either. In Cash's autobiography, June was a very strong, patient, sweet and dignified woman. The movie, however, has Reese Witherspoon portraying June as an ill tempered, mean mouthed battle axe. The movie also made Johnny Cash look wimpy and pathetic. Even during the weakest time of his life, the man still had strength, character, dignity, and a keen sense of humour. The good things I can say about Walk The Line is that the music and singing was pretty decent, and the clothes, the hairstyles and the cars were very authentic. I'll give Joaqin phoenix due credit for being able to do the tough job of looking and sounding like Johnny Cash.",

The songs are all good, but it seems like they spent a lot of time trying to establish the fact that Cash rubbed elbows with the big names of 1950s music. Jerry Lee Lewis is certainly an entertaining character, but why bother throwing him into the film for the sake of throwing him into the film? The movie just dragged on, turning into a long story of \"will they or won't they\" with June Carter and Johnny Cash, a story that had no suspense or interest.

Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are so \"Walk the Line\" never strays far from the rise and fall form of your traditional biopic, but like Julie Taymor's underappreciated \"Frida\", it hardly matters if you cast the right actors. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are so spot-on as Johnny and June Carter Cash, they could've succeeded in a mock-concert film. Phoenix's live performances surpasses Gary Busey's work on \"The Buddy Holly Story\" and that's no faint praise. Busey was great; very Holly-like, but Phoenix IS Cash, even though the two bare only the slightest resemblance. As for Witherspoon, she hasn't beem this incandescent since her debut in Robert Mulligan's \"The Man in the Moon\". She nearly steals the movie away from Phoenix, which seems almost appropriate since June Carter Cash gave this film its title. To ignore the extraordinary chemistry between two actors who seem to be at the height of their craft because they exist in an admittedly ordinary screenplay would be to miss the point of this truly galvanizing movie. Phoenix and Witherspoon transform showbiz cliches into emotional truth. If you loved Ray Charles, you loved \"Ray\". If you didn't love Johnny Cash, you'll, at worst, love Joaquin Phoenix's version of The Man in Black\" better than the real Mccoy, and second-guess your original assessment of this popular music recording giant. \"Walk the Line\" is a triumph of mimicry and sound.",

But really, this is just a better than average standard biopic. It is mystifying to see all the comments above claiming this film transcends the form, when in fact it clings to the bioipic format like a limpet. Which is a pity, as there was a whole lot more that was soulful and interesting in Johnny Cash's life than what is portrayed here (ie Sun records, pill popping, the romance with June, the conflict with his father, the death of his brother in a saw accident). Maybe there should be a sequel. One that focuses on the fact that Johnny was slightly more than a self-pitying, self-obsessed drug addict with no manners, and that he stood for a number of social causes of note, and that he helped define and then redefine both country and folk music. Compare this film to Ray, where you really got what was special about Ray Charles. Somehow, what was truly great about Johnny Cash gets left behind in the smouldering desire and the period detail. And while the music in the film is engaging enough (it is hard to really destroy good material, and as the musical director, T-Bone Burnett was never going to allow that to happen anyway), it is pretty illuminating to play the soundtrack up against the real thing, as I did shortly afterwards. A good effort Joaquin, but Johnny Cash had a once in a lifetime voice, and was a unique artist. Not just a rock'n'roll wannabee. Overall, good - but not great.",

If you know nothing about Johnny Cash, and are curious to know more, this is not a good place to start. Walk The Line uses a standard formula of revealing a man through showing him in his most desperate hours, to gain attention for itself first and foremost, and in so doing lacks subtlety and heart. Surprisingly, the film does not seem overly interested in the music (Cash band member's have barely a couple of line's to say in the movie combined) and as a consequence, music and artist seem somehow disconnected. But of course the focus of the film is the agonising moments in the personal life of the man who made the music, or more specifically his pursuit of a woman that for a number of years, he couldn't have. Barely a minute into the only song we see from the famous Fulsom prison concert, the scene is cut, in favour of a bus moving through the dark night, where Johnny (helpless as a dog on heat) wakes June up and says \"will you marry me\". His persistence eventually wears June down, and by the end of the film you can only try to remember that Johnny Cash was also a man with an immense sense of personal dignity, charm, intelligence, warmth and humour - as one might find in a Cash performance of the song Big River (about yearning for a woman).

I was sucked into this film from the very start, and didn't find myself bored even once. I barely noticed how long it was, and even though there were so many musical performance in the film, I never found myself thinking, \"Come on! Get back to the story!\" And I think that's because it felt as much a part of the story as everything else. I could not help but be won over by Witherspoon (who I normally despise). She was incredibly cute when she needed to be and was incredibly real in her character's stubborn moments. Carter was obviously a rock for Johnny Cash. And that's what this movie is all about. And it didn't ONCE come off as resembling a Lifetime tv movie.",

      "content": "It's as predictable a sign of autumn as football, falling leaves and hot chocolate and just as comforting: the annual highly-touted, loaded-for-Oscar-bear musical biopic of the life and troubled times of a much-loved, seminal rock It's as predictable a sign of autumn as football, falling leaves and hot chocolate and just as comforting: the annual highly-touted, loaded-for-Oscar-bear musical biopic of the life and troubled times of a much-loved, seminal rock figure that your parents are more familiar with than you are, though if the movie's good, it could change that. (Next year or the year after that, how about a Chuck Berry movie starring one of the few current actors who can pull off playing ages 20 through 70: Sam Jackson?) It's interesting to note the schematic similarities in the life stories of last year's subject Ray Charles and this year's, Johnny Cash: both rose from childhoods that were beyond poverty-stricken; both were haunted by guilt arising from a brother's death that neither was at all to blame for, and the pressures of fame and fortune frequently turned both into seemingly unredeemable s.o.b.'s, even if you leave drugs and alcohol out of the equation. Ray, featuring Jamie Foxx's justly lauded impersonation-and-beyond, was a very satisfying entertainment but Walk the Line, if anything, is slightly more so. James Mangold's direction is a bit more meat-and-potatoes and a lot less flashy than Taylor Hackford's of the 2004 film, and that's a good thing: Cash's persona and story are so compelling that they don't need hokey 50's-style montages (Ray's biggest weakness) depicting his rise to the top. Mangold (Cop Land, Identity) gives his film a leisurely pace, allowing it to build its own momentum, and rightly focuses on its two wonderful central performances: Reese Witherspoon's run of sometimes negligable romantic comedy fluffballs may actually have contributed to the real tension she brings to the role of June Carter, Cash's performing partner, collaborator and best friend whom he wants to become Something More. And Joaquin Phoenix, who specializes in playing extremely naive or innocent souls (Ladder 49, Signs, Return to Paradise) brings a toughness and world-weariness to Cash that I didn't know Phoenix had in him. (He also accomplishes the remarkable sequential feat of allowing Cash's famously growly speaking and singing voice to grow and evolve over the years rather than emerging with it full-blown from puberty onward.) Walk the Line hasn't been marketed to the recently-tapped Christian moviegoing community with the aggressiveness of Chronicles of Narnia, and perhaps it should've, but then even though Cash had a solid churchgoing background and kicked various habits later in life largely due to Christianity, the pull and fascination of the dark side throughout his life seems at times to be almost as strong as it was for Anakin Skywalker; you can almost see the little angel and devil miniatures of Cash sitting on his shoulders. (I find it striking and revealing that Cash, near the end of his life, invited Phoenix to dinner at his home...and proceeded to stun the actor by quoting Phoenix's dialogue as evil ruler Commodus in Gladiator line by line.) The honesty with which Walk the Line depicts the married Cash's largely emotional affair with June (a situation that ANYONE who's endured an unrequited crush on a coworker can very easily identify with), and the toll it takes on Cash's marriage is admirable; not only does it refuse to make his wife (Gennifer Godwin) a villainess or justify his neglect of her, but her lament to Cash that he gave her everything but himself comprises the movie's most poignant scene. Walk the Line clearly and rightly admires Cash's abundant songwriting and performing genius and his ability to overcome both circumstantial and self-inflicted tribulations, but doesn't sugarcoat or whitewash any of his behavior, and in the end, I think that's precisely the way that the 'Man in Black' would've wanted it.",

Also, I fault the film for largely ignoring the important role of Cash's Christianity in his recovery and his art. Cash was a progressive evangelical, a species of Christian that has almost vanished from the public arena in the United States today. I wish more on that had been included.

The second act is a ring of fire. Cash's relationship with June Carter adds passion to this film and saves it from total mediocrity.

Both Phoenix and Witherspoon bring their characters to believable life; and Phoenix should be commended on attempting to sing like Cash. LIke Dylan, Johnny Cash was one of the truly distinct voices in rock and country; therefore, Phoenix deserves his accolades. However, there was too much life and living in the life of Johnny Cash to capture in film. Perhaps, this is why many may be merciful in their judgement. Still, Carter's salvation of Cash would have been more powerful and moving if we had more insight into the depth of his great despair.",
