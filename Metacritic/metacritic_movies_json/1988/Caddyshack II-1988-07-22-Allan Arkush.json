    "It`s shoddy, lazy and numbingly stupid.",
    "A disaster. Mason founders in his poorly written role, and none of the film's endless series of gags is the least bit funny.",
    "Caddyshack II, a feeble follow-up to the 1980 laff riot, is lamer than a duck with bunions, and dumber than grubs. It's patronizing and clumsily manipulative, and top banana Jackie Mason is upstaged by the gopher puppet.",
    "The film features someone who walks like Jackie Mason, talks like Jackie Mason, does everything except make people laugh like Jackie Mason.",
    "This PG-rated romp is bland bananas compared to its R-rated predecessor. Besides, immediately following the liberating craziness of Animal House, another slob comedy didn't seem like such a bad idea. Now, after nearly a decade of slob comedies, the last thing we need is yet another, tamer one.",
    "This movie is soooo bad (How bad is it?) that it makes \"Caddyshack I\" look like \"Godfather II.\""

Not unwatchably bad, just not that great.  As a PG movie, I'dI really enjoyed the first 30 minutes of “Caddyshack II”.  There were a lot of fun comedic bits and it even has a good message; however, the rest of the movie kind of drags.  Not unwatchably bad, just not that great.  As a PG movie, I'd recommend this if you have a young kid around and you are looking for something to watch together.  I think this movie gets a worse rep than it deserves because it is not the same kind of movie as the original “Caddyshack”.  The sequal is more about delivering a positive message that is geared at kids, rather than being the raunchy R rated comedy of the first one.  I give it a C, if you've already seen the best, but you insist on watching a movie, try this one out.",
