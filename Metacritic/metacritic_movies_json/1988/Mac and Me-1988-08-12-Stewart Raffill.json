  "critic_reviews": [
    "In addition to its lack of originality, MAC AND ME is also blatantly commercial, selling everything from candy to soft drinks to fast-food restaurants--the film includes a \"special guest appearance\" by Ronald MacDonald.",
    "Itâ€™s an amazingly bald-faced copy of E. T. even though this is E. T. in a sticky wrapper, left under the heater two hours too long.",
    "Alan Silvestri's score is the worst mix of ersatz Jerry Goldsmith and schlock pop tunes, and the acting is pretty weak, though the filmmakers get good marks for using Calegory, a real-life disabled 11-year-old who brings a healthy authenticity to his role.",
    "Jade Calegory, who plays the boy-hero in this cuddly alien yarn, was born with spina bifida, and the film is neither sentimental nor exploitative in dealing with its wheelchair-confined star. Unfortunately, there's little else to commend.",
    "With its cardboard family and familiar aliens, MAC and Me would seem like the generic version of E. T. if it were not so full of brand-name commercials.",
    "Shameless E.T. knockoff.",
    "A mercenary display of product placement and a bad advertisment for filmmaking.",
    "Everything about Mac And Me is shameless."

The aliens give my literal nightmares and its pretty much just a McDonalds movie.I can't stress how bad it is, but yet, it is so hilarious to watch!",
