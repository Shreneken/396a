  "critic_reviews": [
    "How can you make a movie about a man who cannot change, whose whole life is anchored and defended by routine? Few actors could get anywhere with this challenge, and fewer still could absorb and even entertain us with their performance, but Hoffman proves again that he almost seems to thrive on impossible acting challenges.",
    "Fortunately, the script by Ronald Bass and Barry Morrow isn't half bad, and both Barry Levinson's direction and the performances are agreeably restrained.",
    "Only after the Hollywood hypnotism wears off is it apparent that Rain Man, fundamentally an artsy sentimentalization of \"The Odd Couple,\" is somewhat less than the sum of its perfect parts.",
    "Rain Man rises above the banality of its concept--another buddy movie crossbred with a road picture--to become a genuinely moving and intelligent look at what it means to be human.",
    "It's a mature assignment for Cruise and he's at his best in the darker scenes.",
    "Hoffman blows costar Cruise right off the screen...Instead of playing off or with Hoffman (a greenhorn's smartest strategy), Cruise tends to play at him, flailing and swearing like a spoiled, grounded pilot in \"Top Gun II.\"",
    "It's Hoffman's failure, though, that sinks the picture. He is working here with his usual meticulousness, but there's no relaxation in his performance, no sense that he has ever merged with his subject, that he has found Raymond's center and is simply acting out of it."

This movie is one of the most moving and touching movies ever made and to some level of degree it's about acceptance. There's the subject of love in the film because Tom Cruise who plays Charlie Babbitt in Rain Man has a girlfriend or partner and also there's a fair degrees of love between Charlie Babbitt and his autistic brother Raymond Babbitt (Hoffman). Tom Cruise never knows he has a brother until someone tells him one mysterious day which kind of upsets him and to a degree shocks him but he's happy he knows he has a brother. The brothers hang out, even go to casino's because Raymond Babbitt the autistic brother is very clever with numbers, money and other things so can win a fortune for him and his brother at casino's. Mind you this looks like they are using some cheating method to swindle all the loot from the businesses which is quite dodgy. A great drama movie with hints of comedy and romance throughout. Pretty good and faultless acting in my book and all the characters are likeable.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nWell, now.  To say the very least, RAIN MAN is absolutely brilliant.  Dustin Hoffman delivers an fantastic performance as the autistic character Raymond Babbitt, a role for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1988.  In fact, Hoffman's performance is so outstanding that in comparison to Colin Firth as King George VI and Tom Hanks as the titular character in FORREST GUMP (using examples of other Academy Award-winning disabled roles), Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt is definitely the superior one.  Tom Cruise also does an acceptable job as Charlie Babbitt, a greedy, selfish man who lives his whole life unaware that Raymond is his brother.  I didn't expect very much of this film, as it looked like it would be utterly irritating--and I will admit, I was irritated at some parts, such as the various times at which Raymond continuously recites lines from Abbott and Costello's comedy act, \"Who's on First?\"--but otherwise, RAIN MAN was an exceptionally great, thoroughly memorable motion picture.",

Autism is a touching topic, but it gives us an idea of both character's vulnerability and unstable personality. This is not supposed to be a weepy film, it is a film of beauty and wonder, of the dark and light sides of the human condition. It just dips enough to get us to think what might be right for people with disabilities and leaves us to make our own assumptions on this sort of issue. Of course, both main characters aren't numb, sometimes they just hide their feelings away, but we can obviously see how both of their lives entwine, without turning into a tear-jerking drama. It just makes us able to view the world we live in in a different light. When it comes to these sorts of films, often you're left wondering about the uptight views of the critics and the public, ESPECIALLY THE CRITICS.",

The situations are realistic, it doesn't paint an overly joyous happy ending and the characters of Dustin Hoffman's 'Raymond' and Tom Cruises 'Charlie' are equally  important, relying on each other for gratification rather than playing to the fact that Raymond is in fact autistic, but the writers have perfectly created the Cruise character to balance out a well crafted and touching drama.\rCharlie is a hotshot car dealer who must try and close a deal before the end of the day otherwise he will lose his clients, but he finds out that his father has died, and Charlie must go to Cincinnati along with his girlfriend to attend the funeral, and look over the will that his father left.\rTo Charlie's shock, his father has only left him his car (which he never let Charlie drive when he was younger) and nothing else. He then discovers that his fathers inheritance has been placed in a trust fund in a mental institute, where Charlie discovers his autistic brother, someone he never knew existed.\rCharlie's selfishness is soon tested as we learn more and more about Raymond, his routines must happen, his anxious behaviour helps him cope, and he must be in bed and lights out by 11pm, these little things are Raymond's life, and Charlie at first has difficulty dealing with them.\rAs their road trip continues, Charlie learns valuable lessons about his brother, and about himself, simply because he learns to accept that Raymond cannot change, but that he is remarkable in his own right, especially his memory and his mathematical skills.\rIts a truly touching film with superb acting, Hoffman portraying an obviously controversial character, but one that truly stands out in his loveable and fact-based self, Cruise is forever seeking to change his brother, but his determination cannot be ignored, but the chemistry between Cruise and Hoffman is realistically wonderful.\rTruly, the film absolutely deserved the Academy awards simply for the fact that it doesn't try to be glam, but it gives the message that you don't have to reach for the stars to be happy, that it could indeed be right in front of you.\rSuperb film that has aged well and certainly one that is still a powerful reminder of the dramatic effects of human behaviour, in this case with and even without autism, because it isn't always the disabled person with the biggest problems.",

Overall, brilliant film elevated by the two leads and the direction primarily. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

It is not the same disability as the main character of this film but she is disabled. I am allowed to be a bit critical of this film without being deeply hated. Alright, that has been established. To begin, I don't know what it was running against, but I'm not sure this should have won best picture. Sure, Hoffman's performance is astounding, but the movie's greatness solely relied on just that. It deserved a nomination for it's writing and a definite win for acting, but this movie probably got a lot of sympathy for being one of the first films to touch on the subject of people with disabilities. This poked too much fun at the disabled for me to feel for this movie. At first, it displays the behavior of a disabled person as entertaining, then decides that it shouldn't poke fun at the disabled and Tom Cruise suddenly has been changed by his brother. Predictable and a bit hypocritical. Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie, just not the great one that everyone thinks it is, at least to me. In short, if you want to see a movie with an astounding performance and heart, watch this movie. But just compare this movie to I Am Sam for a moment from a point of view similar to mine. Disabled people aren't for us to give our sympathy to just based on who they are. Don't feel bad if you don't think this is an awesome movie because we all have our opinions.",

So, in the case of \"Rain Man,\" I gathered three attributes from listening to others talk about this movie for so many years — the quotability, the comedy and the fact that it kind of doesn't age well. And, I have to say, I'm sitting at a big, fat goose egg on pretty much every account. That's not to say the 1989 Best Picture winner doesn't have a few memorable lines, laughs or scenes that make you wince. I simply found this to be a much more enduring piece of drama, than it was a comedy. And, for the scenes that \"don't age well,\" could it be that we as a moviegoing populace kind of miscalculated the way they were supposed to be taken from jump? No, you're not supposed to like Tom Cruise's character. No, you're not necessarily supposed to want Dustin Hoffman to end up with him in the end. This is a text book drama, filled with anger, baggage and characters making critical errors in both judgment and emotionality. My gut instinct is to err on the side of allowing a narrative to challenge its audience. \"Rain Man\" does so, and its success is thanks in no small part to the incredible performance work from both Hoffman and Cruise, as well as some staging from Barry Levinson and a classic score from Hans Zimmer.",

His younger brother, hard-driving luxury car dealer Charlie Babbitt (Cruise), has his limitations, too – mostly in the areas of kindness and understanding.\r Unaware of Raymond’s existence (he’d been institutionalized when Charlie was very young) until his estranged father dies, Charlie is brought up short when he learns the old man’s entire $3 million fortune has been willed to his brother.\r After a trip to the East Coast institution where Raymond resides, Charlie shanghais him, without regard for his welfare, into a cross-country trip to L.A., dangling a Dodger game as bait. Meanwhile, he threatens Raymond’s guardian, the bland Dr. Bruner (Jerry Molen), with a custody battle unless he hands over half the fortune.\r Director Barry Levinson (“Diner,” “Good Morning, Vietnam,”) lingers long on the road trip segment, building the relationship between the brothers degree by degree and decorating it with spectacular, if self-conscious, landscapes shot through tinted lenses. Result is lightly engrossing, buoyed here and there by emergence of Raymond’s unique abilities (for example, he can memorize half a telephone book in an evening and also can perform extravagant multiplications in a flash).\r f an actor with more range than Cruise had been cast, pic might have gone over the top in its final scenes. As is, it stops a little short. It’s a mature assignment for Cruise and he’s at his best in the darker scenes. When the executor of the will shields information from him, the actor displays an utterly grim, brickheaded determination that is frightening.\r Hoffman achieves an exacting physical characterization of Raymond, ftom his constant nervous movements to his rigid, hunched shoulders and childish gait. Though he can neither look anyone in the eye nor engage in real conversation, Raymond certainly can be funny, with his well-timed offhand responses to Charlie’s hammering questions. (Cruise: Raymond, am I using you? Hoffman: Yeah.)\r Italian actress Valeria Golino strikes just the right chord as Charlie’s sensitive, long-suffering girlfriend.\r “Rain Man” does offer some delightful scenes of droll comedy in running gags between the two brothers, built around such daily trivia as maple syrup and boxer shorts.\r Locations, costumes and tech contributions are good, particularly considering pic was lensed in a rushed nine weeks of location work.\r The music by Hans Zimmer is fresh and provocative.",

It is aThere are excellent films, bad films, average films... but there are also films that, although they're good, are clearly stilted, as if they were great without, in fact, being that excellent. This film, for me, fits that description. It is a good film, and that is indisputable, but it is not as good and as remarkable as many have said. The film won four Oscars, namely Best Film, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor, and with all fairness, but against weak competitors.The story is simple: Charles Babbit is a skilled car dealer who is in a delicate business situation when he is informed of the death of his father, with whom he had not spoken for years. Counting on inheriting his fortune, he is angry to know that he inherited only a classic car and all the money will be managed by a fund in favor of a brother he did not know, who is in a clinic because he is autistic. Determined to contest the will, he kidnaps his brother and takes him to Los Angeles on a long road trip, where they will have the opportunity to get closer.The story that the film brings us is good but I didn't find it particularly credible. Its hard to believe that a hardened selfish person like Charlie could change in a few days. Although the idea is pleasant, it seems naive. There are also some points where the film seemed illogical to me, such as the ease with which Charlie removed his brother from the clinic. In any case, if we are willing to accept the story, the film will compensate us because its good, has a lot of quality, no dead moments and manages to keep us interested.If the plot is good, dialogues and cast performances are even better. The dialogues are excellent, particularly the lines given to Dustin Hoffman, where we have a lot of references to North American cultural landmarks and some tributes, such as the quotations by Abbott & Costello. In fact, Hoffman is the most striking actor, with a superb interpretation of an autistic character. It is difficult to play handicapped characters without it looking like a caricature or a bad taste joke, but Hoffman has managed to put soul and elegance into his work and to look authentic. Less interesting to me was Tom Cruise, but he's a good actor and did an excellent job by giving us an acid and disagreeable character, but who the audience would have to give a chance for redemption, so he couldn't be just hateful. Much less positive was the performance of Valeria Golino. She was left the most of the film and is quickly set aside.Technically, it is a fairly regular film. It has a pleasant cinematography, with good color and light and great beautiful cars (they are an important element of the film). The trip allows the use of good landscapes from several places of the United States, with emphasis on vibrant Las Vegas. The costumes are awful, but they were the fashion in the Eighties, a decade with no sense of taste at all. The soundtrack, by Hans Zimmer, is decent but does not stand out, if we exclude the opening song, known enough to be in the ear.",

It really was on my radar for a very very long time. The movie's story is not unconventional by any means, but thanks to Levinson's smart direction, Ronald Bass' powerful script that adds a lot of fresh details, and the terrific performances from the leads, Rain Man feels very original. In fact, I can even see how the ending would be from the beginning, but that didn't make the slightest issue for me. Barry Levinson presented the movie in a way that manages to generate emotion in their audience without ever feeling melodramatic. That's because Levinson avoided many clichés, the most important one of them is the typical way of storytelling. Instead of making a movie that relies on drama, he made road-trip movie that produces a catharsis of emotions more than you would ever imagine.  As a matter of fact, the movie feels as if it has a character-driven story, except it's actually not. And the result is a movie that has a very restricted and bound plot, but it never feels that way. While watching the movie, I felt that I can't expect anything. I felt as if I was watching a movie with a picaresque tale, but it's actually far from being that.  Unlike Wag the Dog, Rain Man has a lot of memorable moments that will stay with you forever. In other words, Barry Levinson made Rain Man feels more cinematic than Wag the Dog. But I'll say it again, the movie never feels overly sentimental. Dustin Hoffman gave one of the Best Performances in his career, but I really can't say if he had deserved the Oscar more than Tom Hanks in Big or not. Tom Cruise's performance is really what stands out in my opinion. I think he gave one of, if not his best performance ever. I don't want to spoil anything for who haven't watched this wonderful film yet, but there are a lot of scenes that show Cruise's acting abilities, and prove that he is underappreciated as an actor who really can deliver some exceptional dramatic performances, not just doing incredible stunts and running. I think he deserved to be nominated for an Oscar at the least. That being said, I have some issues with Rain Man. The first one is that the beginning was a bit rushed and very fast-paced for its own good. Specially because the drama kicks off very early, and the movie should have taken its time to represent it. The entire message of the movie has been literally revealed near the end by Tom Cruise, so that's an obvious, and a bit annoying problem.Also, the ending could have been a little bit shorter. However, the last 15-20 minutes has some of the smartest, and most powerful dialogue ever written. And it also has the most intense and moving moments in the movie. The moments that show Raymond math prowess were very hilarious and funny at the beginning, then they became kinda overused, but after that they were taken advantage of very cleverly.Overall, I loved Rain Man so much, and I really don't know why there are many people who think it didn't deserve the Oscar for Best Picture. It's meticulously written, impressively directed, beautifully shot, superbly acted, engaging, moving, touching, and above all that, it's very enjoyable. Also, Zimmer's score is electrifying!(8.5/10)",

The absolute superb cinematography and brilliant direction of Barry Levinson to go with a fantastic script gives us the best movie of 1988. Every year it seems Hollywood gives us a film that for reasons good or bad will be forever remembered. This is that film for 1988. Rain man is one of the most beloved films of all time at this point 30 plus years later. It's one of those films that no matter how many times you've seen it, whenever it's on you stop and watch it.",

And it was energizing. The only negative point of the film was that it got boring in some parts of the film. The end of the film was one of the best and most logical endings in the history of cinema. All in all, this film deserves praise.",
