  "summary": "When two girls move to the country to be near their ailing mother, they have adventures with the wondrous forest spirits who live nearby.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Miyazaki so effectively captures the feeling of a child’s life, inside as well as out, that little ones are often mesmerized by the movie, and adults are returned to a time when they could enjoy mystery for its own sake.",
    "Here is a children's film made for the world we should live in, rather than the one we occupy. A film with no villains. No fight scenes. No evil adults. No fighting between the two kids. No scary monsters. No darkness before the dawn. A world that is benign. A world where if you meet a strange towering creature in the forest, you curl up on its tummy and have a nap.",
    "An otherworldly tale of childhood and a definitive work of imagination.",
    "Hayao Miyazaki's family fantasy is full of benign spirituality, prelapsarian innocence, but little icky sentiment.",
    "An animated achievement almost without parallel.",
    "Compared to the breathtaking action sequences and elaborate fantasy landscapes of Miyazaki's early features, the genteel, languid Totoro seems at first slight, and even soporific. Yet My Neighbor Totoro may be the most enduring entry in Miyazaki's impressive filmography, because it's so particular about the nuances of human behavior and emotion.",
    "The two kids are effortlessly real and emotionally complex, but profoundly simple, and Miyazaki’s unique masterpiece embraces that childlike existence.",
    "It’s a film that proves time and again that life itself is the grandest, most galvanizing of all dramas.",
    "Sheer enchantment, this 1989 animated feature is a key early work by Hayao Miyazaki. It exemplifies Ghibli's style of fanciful realism, paying close attention to minute details as well-drawn figures move across a fluid backdrop. It also deals straightforwardly with substantial emotions like fear of death, though at times it veers toward the heart-tugging cuteness of the Pokemon series.",
    "My Neighbor Totoro is a gentle and affirming film. It's certain to delight smaller children, although boys accustomed to the slam-bang violence of super-hero cartoon features and TV shows may chafe at its leisurely pace.",
    "An ideal animated film for young children, it has also found favor among adults who appreciate its unusually gentle, painterly style of animation, a trademark of the film's director, Japan's most renowned animator, Hayao Miyazaki.",
    "Miyazaki's appreciation of miraculous possibilities and childhood visions is what drives Totoro.",
    "When My Neighbor Totoro, which was written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, is dispensing enchantment, it can be very charming. Too much of the film, however, is taken up with stiff, mechanical chitchat.",
    "Writer-director Hayao Miyazaki has essentially padded a television half-hour into a sluggish theatrical feature."

In fact it is one of my favourites from them. There are so many wonderful things about My Neighbour Totoro. It is very simple in story and character but it is all very beautiful, charming and touching. The animation is typical Ghibli, ethereal-looking and just ravishing to watch, while the music is one of my favourite scores in a Ghibli film. The story is simple, but I loved the simplicity, it had such a pleasant atmosphere to it, and the characters are engaging with great chemistry together. I have very little to complain about the voice acting either, everybody did a fine job. In conclusion, in my opinion this is an animated classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

This is the best movie that captured the childhood very accurately. The children characters behave so realistically that I couldn't believe my eyes while watching them play, cry, laugh, or doing anything. I didn't felt like I was watching a child in front of me, but I felt like I was watching my younger self. I felt like I was watching myself as a child. As if my childhood memories were being displayed before me. Even if I haven't done that thing the characters did, I feel that my younger self would do the exact thing. That doesn't mean anything but that Hayao Miyazaki is a real genius! But the greatest thing about My Neighbor Totoro isn't how realistic it feels, but it's the fabulous message it delivers, and the thing that is more fascinating is the way it delivers this message. I really shouldn't spoil anything about this gorgeous film, but it delivers a message about facing the fear; the fear of everything, and the fear in all its kinds and levels. Miyazaki merged this message with this story that almost has no plot! I shouldn't call it delivering the message, instead, I should call it merging or combining the message with the story, or rather I should say that Miyazaki created an entire story from a message! Hayao Miyazaki proved that it's not even necessary for a movie to have an antagonist, or at least not a common one, as I mentioned above, the story itself is about a message about facing the fear. And I didn't feel at any time throughout the movie that I need a common antagonist or a usual problem to be invested in the movie. I was engaged and hooked from the very beginning of the movie till the end credits scene, which is very cool, by the way. The thing is that at the third act the movie changed completely in terms of the plot; it turned from a plot-free movie to a movie that has a real plot and a very serious problem. The plot and its problem didn't come from nowhere; they are attached very well to the story from its beginning, and it's been appeared later that the plot is kinda share the same message of the story, but the problem is that the movie changed a great deal when it moved from its second to the third act. It was like the movie betrayed itself after promising that it well keep the audience on the edge of their seat without using any problem or obstacle. Yes I've been engaged again and invested in the story with its plot because I cared about every single character, but it took me a little time, and I really felt disturbed and annoyed with this inconsistency. Overall, I can say that My Neighbor Totoro is an imaginative tale that every parent should take his child and watch it with him or her. Because it's message is actually more important to the adults.I prefer My Neighbor Totoro to Spirited Away, but let's face it, Spirited Away is the best Miyazaki movie!(8.5/10)",

It does a good job of establishing the characters as relatable, in a way that a lot of animated films never do. The imagination and the joy of youth really does come through in the presence of the two girls. However, the movie probably spends too much time with them in its lackadaisical state and not enough time on story. Half an hour into the film, the novelty of the movies encapsulation of youthfulness and subtly implied magical world-building, start to wear thin. You may find yourself questioning where the film is going. Be prepared to wait nearly another hour wondering, as this film is very light on plot. At the end of the film it does pull out everything it can to provide an emotional and satisfying conclusion, and succeeds quite well at doing so in fact. But I'm not sure the meandering journey was quite worth the destination. The movie could have probably been helped by a harsher edit; a good twenty minutes or so cut from the movie might have helped the pacing. Also, worth mentioning is that the music is quite good, if not sometimes a little elevator music-y. The Totoro theme that plays over the credits is quite catchy.",

But if I am going to start somewhere, Studio Ghibli has definitely proven themselves to be an important studio, where their older works feels a breeze of fresh air. \"My Neighbor Totoro\" can definitely be considered a classic, as it feels like the first time every time you come back. All of those clean elements and lively attributes are shown through every scene. Similarly how I've felt after a lot of other Ghibli movies, there is a sense of speechlessness and a need to delve deeper into every shot. Details lead as a main point to why this movie feels so alive; they are never unnecessary, because they never distract you from the main plot.The leitmotif that reoccurs through the movie has a very eerie but also calming feeling to it. The forest where the \"Totoros\" live becomes very so magical and mysterious, where you understand better why Tatsuo (the professor and father) teaches his children how important it is to show respect and gratefulness. Going back to one of my previous points: you feel like you want to dive deeper and discover the entire world outside of the screen's limits. There is a lot more that could be said about this movie, but there are too many thoughts and feelings mixed together that it would be difficult to find a way to summarize it all. But if I have to, consider this one of the greatest Japanese media of all time, because it has an impact like nothing else could.",
