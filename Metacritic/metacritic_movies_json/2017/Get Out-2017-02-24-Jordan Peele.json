  "critic_reviews": [
    "Get Out is very creepy, very funny and as pitiless as a surgeon’s scalpel.",
    "Retro horror and racial tension mix to surprisingly entertaining effect in Get Out.",
    "Peele succeeds where sometimes even more experienced filmmakers fail: He’s made an agile entertainment whose social and cultural observations are woven so tightly into the fabric that you’re laughing even as you’re thinking, and vice-versa.",
    "Get Out is a ludicrous paranoid fantasy, but that doesn’t mean it’s not alive in the unconscious. Having it out there in so delightful a form helps us laugh at it together — and maybe later, when we’ve thought it over, shudder.",
    "Peele’s perfectly tuned cast and deft camera work unleash his uproarious humor along with his political fury; with his first film, he’s already an American Buñuel",
    "Blending race-savvy satire with horror to especially potent effect, this bombshell social critique from first-time director Jordan Peele proves positively fearless — which is not at all the same thing as scareless.",
    "Like so much of Key & Peele’s comedy, Get Out is refreshing in its naked, frank aggression about confronting racial issues, with comedy, drama, and sharp, unsparing insight.",
    "What makes Get Out more than just a slam-bang scarefest is that, in its own darkly satiric way, it is also a movie about racial paranoia that captures the zeitgeist in ways that many more “prestigious” movies don’t.",
    "Peele is so attuned to the tiny ways race sneaks into conversations that we hear it in every line. Our suspicions are so heightened, we start to second-guess our own senses.",
    "Movies with this serious a message about race are rarely fun to watch, but Peele has a perfect handle on tone, knowing just when to lean toward menacing, eerie or sharply funny and when to tip things in another direction.",
    "This is the essence of Get Out, which only grows more darkly relevant as the main story gets going, masterfully unfurling all of the real-life anxieties of Existing While Black while simultaneously mining that situation for all its twisted absurdity.",
    "Part of what makes Get Out both exciting and genuinely unsettling is how real life keeps asserting itself, scene after scene.",
    "Get Out starts with a great title and a promising idea — a black man’s fear as he walks at night down a street in an affluent white suburb. Then it delivers on that promise with explosive brilliance.",
    "Jordan Peele has made an extraordinary leap in genre here, and he’s also crafted a horror film that has more blistering observations about race than half a dozen well-intentioned Oscar-bait dramas.",
    "Get Out is fully surprising in both concept and craft, with the scares never coming just when you expect them and the secrets more audacious than you might be guessing.",
    "When the film moves out of the paranoiac realm and into action, the violence is deeply satisfying, the twists delightful.",
    "A jolt-a-minute horroshow laced with racial tension and stinging satirical wit.",
    "Like all great movies, Get Out faithfully obeys the conventions of its genre — in this case horror films shot through with brutal wit and sharp-eyed allegory — while getting at profound psychic and political realities. The shocks and the laughs are thoroughly entertaining, but it’s the truth of Get Out that’s so real.",
    "It is not only the best horror film since “Under the Skin” (2013), but a subversive and often hilarious commentary on race as well.",
    "It's a little of everything: unnerving, funny in just the right way and at the right times, serious about its observations and perspectives on racial animus, straight-up populist when it comes to an increasingly (but not sadistically) violent climax. That's entertainment!",
    "The real star of the film is writer-director Jordan Peele, who has created a work that addresses the myriad levels of racism, pays homage to some great horror films, carves out its own creative path, has a distinctive visual style — and is flat-out funny as well.",
    "Sketch-comedy whiz Jordan Peele of  TV’s ”Key and Peele” and “Keanu” has cooked up the smartest horror movie in ages, an edge-of-your-seat thriller that is entertaining and creepily enlightening at the same time.",
    "Wildly entertaining.",
    "Peele is a talented director of action as well as horror, and Get Out is always far from boring even in its more familiar scenes.",
    "Writer-director Jordan Peele has smartly created a horror comedy that doesn’t feel like a series of sketches from his show: the whole thing is a single, coherent episode and individual scenes are masterfully and subtly crafted with tonal shifts that work well.",
    "The movie rattles with provocations.",
    "It lacks the subtlety of Night of the Living Dead, but deftly balances laughs and bloody thrills.",
    "To call it the most important movie of the year so far makes it sound possibly rather worthy. That’s not true at all. Get Out is a comment on a highly complex situation that’s also a total blast.",
    "Peele's blistering debut is a timely and powerful satire of modern prejudice as much as it is a taut, gripping exercise in horror cinema.",
    "As a writer and a remarkably accomplished first-time director, Peele layers other notions on top as he's inverting those — about servitude, about social privilege, about law enforcement and \"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner\" - style liberals.",
    "This is surely the nerviest, most confrontational treatment of race in America to emerge from a major studio in years, and it brilliantly fulfills the duty of both its chosen genres — the horror-thriller and the social satire — to meaningfully reflect a culture’s latent fears and anxieties.",
    "A scathing examination of race, a take down of phony liberal sympathies that sticks it to racists of every stripe.",
    "Get Out marries racial satire with a terrifying finale, one that tears down blinders that some may have kept conveniently in place. Don’t listen to those who say horror movies are defined by physical scares. Plots based on real-life fears typically make for the most horrifying scenarios.",
    "It's very funny at times, but it isn't a comedy. It is that very rare of beasts: a new and original motion picture.",
    "It does what all great horror movies do: turn real-world anxieties into the stuff of nightmares.",
    "Not only does this genre exercise deliver the little jolts and inside laughs that keep modern horror fans pleased, Get Out is also one of the smartest, funniest, and most socially astute films to come around in a while.",
    "The R, however, isn’t for the usual “extreme gore” of a slasher movie. Instead, it’s mainly for profanity. Get Out has only a little blood and viscera; the approach of writer/first time director Jordan Peele is to approach the more stomach-churning aspects of his production with tact.",
    "This is ultimately a movie about the very bad things that can happen when we don’t address our unease, when we just try to brush it off, whether that’s to fit in or to preserve our self-image. It’s not what we’re not saying, but how we’re not saying it.",
    "As funny and bitingly satirical as one would expect from his Key & Peele sketches.",
    "Throughout Get Out, Jordan Peele incisively probes the connection between liberal racism and good old-fashioned white supremacy.",
    "Get Out reveals an underlying unease. It diffuses tension, even as it points to its source. It may be somewhat rough and unrefined and even ill-considered in some of its particulars. Yet it may stand as a kind of pop culture document of this historical moment, a moment that’s not nearly as funny as this movie.",
    "Get Out loses its nerve winding down but it's a rare horror flick not wasting all its brains on splatter.",
    "Get Out will scare you, make you laugh and perhaps make you uncomfortable. It’s supposed to.",
    "It’s Peele’s first film, but it has none of the rough edges or self-indulgence you’d expect from a rookie.",
    "Peele is undeniably a born filmmaker with big ambitions and an even bigger set of balls. He’s made a horror movie whose biggest jolts have nothing to do with blood or bodies, but rather with big ideas.",
    "Get Out feels fresh and sharp in a way that studio horror movies almost never do. It is both unsettling and hysterical, often in the same moment, and it is totally unafraid to call people on their racist bullshit.",
    "If Get Out isn’t half as scary as the ideas that inspired it, Jordan Peele’s directorial debut is almost certain to be the boldest — and most important — studio genre release of the year. What it lacks in fear, it nearly makes up for in fearlessness.",
    "A horror film with the power to put a rascally grin on the face of that great genre subverter John Carpenter (They Live), Get Out has more fun playing with half-buried racial tensions than with scaring us to death."

Guess who's coming to dinner? It's a black man coming home to a rich suburban white families house for the weekend, and despite their black servants, they're extremely nice to their daughters new boyfriend, too nice, something weird is going on. Yes, something weird is going on, only Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is too stupid to realize it! He's so deeply in love with his girlfriend of all of four months, that not only can't he see what's going on right in front of his face, but he doesn't try to talk to her about it, he doesn't try to investigate any of it, he just sort of goes with the flow. People are raving about this noir thriller, when it is one of the most poorly written films I've seen in a while. Major plot holes aside for the moment, there is absolutely no character development, no chemistry between the actors, and worst of all they don't even reveal the main plot until twenty minutes before the thing is over! Yes, it's weird, yes, something is going on, but the writers don't even hint at what that is! They don't even give us a chance to figure out what it could possibly be. At first it was interesting and I was hoping there would be clues to help us figure out what might be going on, that maybe Chris would find evidence or over hear something, but no such luck. Maybe there could have been a scene without him, that gave us some insight, there was absolutely nothing until the very end, when it was all thrust into our faces and even then it really didn't make a whole lot of sense. Without giving anything away, they never answer the fundamental question, why black people? I never liked traditional noir, but at least most of the time the acting is good and you have some idea of what's going on. This film is just one big circle of confusion and to be honest with you, aside from some terrific comic relief, I hated every minute of it.",

A masterpiece all over, and can you believe this came from JORDAN PEELE from the Key and Peele show? The best thing about this film is that it doesn't focus on the scares much. Sure, the scares come and when they do they're great. In fact, it could be a brilliant thriller film if it wanted to. It's not one of those movies which have way too many scares, with no focus being put upon the storytelling. The pace of the movie is really fast, which is good as in some horror films you feel like they focus more upon the setup and just deliver jump scares at the end. The performances are really good. Daniel Kaluuya is brilliant in the film. Just watch that scene where he first goes into the Sunken Place, excellent acting. I think Allison Williams goes really under the radar as she also gives a good performance. The screenplay and score was outstanding building that feeling of dread and realization that he couldn't get out of the place but was just stuck here. The story is fabulous with so many inventive and creative things making twists all the time. The final act is great, right when you understand everything on one go in that TV conversation scene. There's no wonder that this film won Best Original Screenplay at the oscars",

I figured it was all misdirection for a huge plot twist.  However, after about 45 minutes I started realizing that maybe it wasn't trying to be clever and was simply playing it straight.  Although I held out hope for a major twist it became obvious that the \"twist\" was going to be that the girlfriend was part of the family cult, and I was very disappointed to be right.\"Get Out\" reveals itself to be, in the final analysis, just a middling thriller.  I was shocked to discover that it had received almost universal acclaim.  In my honest opinion, this film is only receiving high marks because of either blind racial solidarity or the fear of being labeled a racist by writing a less-than-glowing review.  It's a competent production - it looks great and has a cool soundtrack - but the actual plot is so flimsy that its attempts at satire are weak.  I can't imagine why anyone honestly thinks that this film is anything other than a mediocre popcorn-muncher that just so happens to include a hot-button political issue in its premise.Daniel Kaluuya gives a great performance as does LilRel Howery.  If it wasn't for them, this movie wouldn't even have been worth watching.  I was disappointed in Catherine Keener's performance; I've admired her past work but here she just phones it in.  The rest of the cast was so boring they're not even worth mentioning.My favorite part of the movie was when Walter, the groundskeeper, came running out of the darkness at Chris.  It was so strange and off-putting that it made the hair on my arms stand up!  That's the kind of stuff you hope for in a horror film but sadly those moments were in short supply.  The other parts that were supposed to be \"odd\" were just forced and cringe-worthy (for instance: Georgina's near-meltdown when her and Chris have their one-on-one conversation).\"Get Out\" is too hollow to be considered profound and too self-indulgent to be considered good entertainment.  However, I think that the director has the talent to someday make a film that lives up to his vision.",

The horror is aimed more at black people because this is a deeply rooted fear. Whites have taken or tried to take everything...now they come for the only thing black people have left. Their bodies. It draws upon influences from history in RL, such as Emmett Till and the horrific and controversial nature of his death, and also the belief that physically Black people are superior. Also the mistrust of white people that has been bred into blacks, and the reverse, speaks to racial disharmony, even within this very thread. Also speaks to further ignorance people have of each other and situations. One person here didn’t understand the movie, so so they believed the success had to do with the lead actor being black, another believed there is a reverse racism.  Neither of those is true.  The very definition of racism makes it impossible for such a thing for reverse racism to exist. The word you’re looking for is prejudice. But not so here either.  This is simply a writer who was able to exploit a fear, of a community of people, who happen to not be white. The critical acclaim comes from the fact that these fears have never been on display so openly before.That is why very few if any black people found this movie funny, but did find it horrific, even though fictional.If you didn’t get the gist of the movie, I urge you to research Emmitt Till, George Stinney, Black WallStreet and History Channels Bio On Lynchings and then watch this again, imagining what it’s like to grow up with that knowledge in your head and what would make you afraid we’re you that person on screen.  Not you, sitting at home in you white skin. Would you watch this movie and think, that could never happen, laughing, or think oh god...what if they did try this...what if they did try?!If you are he’ll bent on believing white men and women are being subjugated and you don’t want to believe otherwise, then skip the research and go watch another movie.

Part of the problem was certainly due to the fact that I saw this on video after the hype and critical reaction had been built so high that it couldn't possibly have lived up to its 87 Metacritic score and 99% Rotten Tomatoes score. If you like your social satire to be \"hit-you-over-the head\" (repeatedly and literally) obvious, then this might be the movie for you. I guess knowing Jordan Peele's other work, I shouldn't have expected \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,\" but I did expect maybe an ounce or two of character development and nuance. This doesn't have that. All the tropes have been done before (did you know that white people play lacrosse and like to ask black people about the NBA?).That said, there are plenty of things to like about this movie. The acting is pretty solid (with the exception of Catherine Keener). Daniel Kaluuya is fantastic. Allison Williams, despite a pretty weak track record, holds up her role with aplomb. Milton \"LilRel\" Howery steals the show with his role as the comic relief/truth teller. Peele's direction does a fantastic job with capturing the creepiness inherent in the setup. It's worth a watch when it makes it to HBO or Netflix, but you may be upset if you shell out the $6 or $7 to see it on PPV.",

Brilliant pacing, & acting.BUT - reverse the races in GET OUT and we'd have a complete *outcry* against this movie being nominated for BEST PICTURE in 2018's Oscars.[ SPOILER ALERT ]The slow, methodical physical and sexual torture white people (including some Asians) vote in this film to perform on a black man because he decided to share a white family's home equally so - proving the dear love he had with a white woman was and will always be fake - coupled with the black man's final resolution of the only way out is a complete slaughter of the whites and then slow, determined strangulation of the white girl who dated him.... Excuse me?Switch the races --If that were a white man visiting a black family --- a Caucasian man visiting an African American family and dating that African American family's daughter --- and the black family did the torturing of the white man ....  resulting in black (instead of white) executions, capped beautifully off with a white man's slow strangulation of a young black woman to free himself from her and her black clan's clutches.  Okay - would that be offered as Oscar's BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR ?An uproar at the very least would be thrown against this heralding of a white man killing African Americans to purportedly escape from the black man's clutches, and the slow strangulation of an African American woman justifiably and rightfully so it can never happen again;  that should not be a Best OSCAR Picture of the Year.Then -- why is this nominated for OSCAR Best Picture of the Year?Oh I guess since they're whites being killed off and strangled it's okay.Best horror film - fine. \"Best Picture of the Year\" .. wow.Though as noted an amazing horror film in pacing and acting, its twisted racial abuse and senseless killing storyline makes me give this a 1.",

The most dissappointing aspect of the movie is that the director actually succeeds inContrary to the many takes and reviews that this movie has received, this movie is neither enlightening, fresh or most importantly, entertaining as a whole. The most dissappointing aspect of the movie is that the director actually succeeds in capturing the proper mood of eeriness that hooks the interest of the audience when watching a movie of this category. Unfortunately, the movie crashes and burns when all the pieces start coming together - or rather does NOT come together. The symbolism comes hard and heavy, and many audiences will already know the racial undertones that the plot conveys.  It is actually solidly acted with all the actors going full bore into their respective characters, and the story creates the mood of off kilter discomfort very well when it comes to the interactions between the straight laced protagonist and the surrounding cast.However the movie devolves into a series of illogical missteps that completely undermines the intent of the movie. Nothing is more dissapointing than seeing a movie start off with great promise and anticipation for a satisfying conclusion, than to see it totally fall apart at the wheels no sooner than the start of the second act, and this is precisely when this movie loses its appeal completely.Serious, possibly thought provoking situations foreshadowed at the start of the movie break down into outright buffoonery more akin to a Wayans brothers Scary Movie plot. One particular development is a shark-jumping moment that makes the movie go from psychological thriller to full on science fiction. Many of these twists and the direction that the movie goes into seem to have been to make a symbolic or overt social commentary, something I understand is a point the film is attempting to create. However, the method is clumsy and ridiculously heavy handed. The most disappointing part is that the commentary is on point - but the sacrifice made to story, plot and logic is so insulting to the audience that the imagery is dulled to an afterthought. Many guides to the hidden meanings of this film exist, but as a movie watcher, should we really need to have a guide book to a story in order for it to make any semblance of sense?I am fairly harsh on this movie because it is one of those films where the initial plot is interesting enough to capture you, you invest your time to learn more, and the result is a slap in the face. You feel cheaply tricked by the time the end credits roll. Most importantly, the subject matter that this movie explores deserves quite a bit more than this schlock.",

Everything plays out in the most predictable manner.As far as the social commentary goes, the movie depicts a world in which every white person cannot avoid making racial remarks for one second. I guess it fits the ridiculous premise, but I found it hard to draw any parallels to reality because of how grotesque the narrative is.While it is watchable, it is very difficult to take seriously.

But it is a comedy, like I said, and it is sure to win many awards in the comedy category. In the film, the ‘help’ of the liberal elite are to serve a purpose that is both funny and quite entertaining. The obvious silly insinuations are full of laughs suitable for the whole family, and jokes for every culture, religion, creed and socio-economic background to enjoy. The entire theatre will burst into unrestrained and spontaneous laughter at the comedic elements strewn forth for the audience’s delight. But if it were a comedy it should have won the category!

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nGet Out (2017), directed by one of the people who got this job the latest, Jordan Peele. The movie was thought to be an American horror, but instead, it was an American thriller and not only it was a thriller but also a kind of social racism to transition to violent, overt racism. It’s like a racism with violence. I don’t know why white hated black so much. We’re in the 21st century and Lincoln had done something for this situation (perhaps get out set up in the 19th century). This movie had a combination of mystery, horror, violence and racism which what I was talking about, an American thriller about racism. The cast was great. I really like the way Daniel Kaluuya acted as Chris Washington, an African-American guy. I saw him looked like a child when he was frozen, hypnotized with tears coming from his eyes. The reason for such good performances was the adapted screenplay. Everything they said made sense and we could understand a lot. The other casts also did great on being the whitties who hated the blacks. Also I should hear someone says **** Rose Armitage was also well-played by Alison Williams. She was a naïve and privileged American white girlfriend of Chris Washington who was hypnotized by her grandfather in the end. LilRel Howery was great as well playing Chris’ best friend Rob who was really funny (his voice, how he acted). How they set the beginning of this movie was totally perfect for a racism. A black man getting abducted by a white guy and was sent into the white guy’s car. I didn’t know what the hell was happening there. When it got to the scenes where many people are visiting the Armitage house, I still was confused what the movie was trying to tell us. I had no clue. It was just a black guy was taken by his girlfriend to her house and then they were eating outside and then the black guy slept then went to the white girl’s mother and she helped him to reduce smoking addiction. Then, when Chris got kidnapped by the Armitages, I suddenly realized this was a racist movie. I really didn’t understand about the hypnotizing part (how could Missy do that?). In spite of being a thriller, there were jump scares like sudden stab and attack (which nobody gives you a clue about someone is gonna attack you) and bloody violences like a guy cut another guy’s upper part of his head to get his brain, it was really disgusting. Blacks and Whites. The cinematography was just great. The views were well-shot. Get Out also spent some of its time capturing the uneasiness of sitting down on a chair having dinner with the whitties when Chris was berated by Dean and Missy for his smoking addiction and he also smoked in front of Rose, their daughter. As you know, Peele is a comedian, we saw that in the Tv Series Key and Peele, some scenes in the movie I found them funny as well. The premise reads like a Key and Peele sketch concept: A black man visits his white girlfriend’s rich family and awkwardness ensues. I have already said that Howery was one part of the humor. I was really entertained watching the movie (even though I wasn’t old enough to watch it). Even though it’s a thriller, horror movie fans might find it entertaining as well and like it a lot. The movie also gave me some Goosebumps and maybe others too perhaps.",

Seriously though, I don't think I've ever seen a movie try so hard to lay out it's social commentary in such an explicit and undeniable way so quickly. It's all just surface level racial stereotype type stuff too, just the typical modern leftwing racial tension stoking. The actual directing and cinematography is not that good either. It honestly feels pretty low budget. Other than the opening \"stay woke\" song, the rest of the musical soundtrack also had me cringing as it all felt very soap operay at times, especially when layered on top of the poor cinematography. The whole movie has a \"made for TV\" feel to it. Most of the acting is mediocre at best, however Daniel Kaluuya did a great job in his role as he always does. That chick from 'Being John Malkovich' did a pretty good job as well. Unfortunately it's the material these actors were given to work with that is the problem. The writing and dialogue are very poor. This is what happens when a writer's main objective is to force \"the message\" to the forefront to this extreme a degree, the potential for actual interesting dialogue and story telling gets put on the back burner and ultimately discarded. As an old school classical Liberal, who wants to strive for a post-racial society, this movie was a chore to sit through. Could be argued this movie is pro-segregation propaganda. The main metaphor is that white people manipulate black people into giving up their \"authentic blackness\" and conforming to \"whiteness\" (whatever the hell those two things are). This movie is a paranoid fever dream for the racially obsessed so-called \"anti-racists\". I'm sure Robin DiAngelo and Kendi love this movie. They probably watch it on a weekly basis. They may even put it on every night to lullaby themselves to sleep. I'm assuming all the praise for this movie is for purely ideological reasons coming from people in that \"anti-rasict\" ideological camp. Very horrible and cringy movie, on multiple levels. I usually try to be pretty objective with my scores and this movie is in all honesty probably a 2 in reality but my classical Liberalism bias is bumping it down to a 1. \"Stay woke\" y'all!!!",

Whether it is the soulful moody music of Donald Glover's Redbone that help set the scene, to the emblematic awkwardness of meeting your significant other's parents for the first time.  This artwork explores how our most vulnerable past experiences have shaped who we are, how cultural disconnect in race can make even the simplest of interactions more complicated than needed.  But most importantly how we view black in America. This film challenges you to think about what your sunken place is because it is different everyone. Because Chris' sunken place only looked liked he was watching tv because in the most helpless point of his life Chris was watching tv.

I went into this movie with no expectations because I didn't want to be disappointed due to the overwhelming hype surrounding the movie. Get Out for me wasn't a horror flick but a psychological thriller shrouded in social commentary about the perceptions and stereotypes people of different races have of each other. Some may find the beginning of this movie to be rather slow because it focuses on character development which for me was a good thing. I found the pace of the movie seemed to flow from scene to scene and I was never bored. I thought every character in the movie held their own and gave great and believable performance particularly the lead actor (Daniel Kaluuya)who played Chris. I felt the lead actor and his co-star(Allison Williams)who played Rose Armitage his girlfriend had a natural chemistry which, drew me into their characters. I loved Chri friend played by comedian(LilRel Howery)who starred as Rod Williams the TSA Agent, who provided the comic relief to the movie. Rose's parents Missy and Dean were odd none to say the lease and added to the thrill of the movie along with the two black employees who were just strange.

Those reviews I can understand but I can't get behind some of the fake reviews that were created to out of spite just to lower the movies overall high score and positive user movie reviews. There are commenters on this site with a shady political agenda and that's unfortunate but don't allow those comments to detour you from seeing this absolutely fun and engaging film.

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nGenerally considered one of the best movies of 2017, it’s rather safe to name ‘Get Out’ as the best horror film of the year. It’s only real competition would be ‘IT’, maybe ‘mother!’ (it’s proven to be rather divisive), and if you want to count it as a horror film, ‘The Shape of Water’. Excluding IT, there is actually a theme linking these recent horror successes. They each have more to them than simply being scary. Whether it be a message you can interpret, dazzling visuals or splashes of comedy, they each bring something else to the table.Directed, surprisingly enough, by Jordan Peele, famous for his hilarious sketch comedy, Get Out is a genuine surprise. Based on the director, I’d made the assumption that this film would be a generic horror comedy, presumably relishing in over-the-top jumpscares and gore. Instead, what I found myself watching was somewhat of a mystery. Jordan Peele himself said that the film ‘can’t be put into a genre box’, and he’s right; it could arguably be a horror film, a suspenseful thriller, a comedy, a mystery or a pretentious commentary of race relations in America. Mercifully, I didn’t interpret it as the latter.Originally conceived following Barack Obama’s second election, the film tackles a subject of race-relations rarely noticed: the opposite of racism. And I’m not talking about ‘reverse-racism’. Many white characters in this film actually love black people so much, they want to become them. Knowing it was written during Obama’s second term, that makes sense. Watching it now, with President Trump in office, gives it a different spin. Regardless of how you interpreted the antagonists, they were probably the most ‘human’ villain in horror in recent memory. Ignoring some questionable science, they were depressingly human.The cinematography was a pleasant surprise. Shots, while rarely astounding, strongly added to the mood. Throughout the film, they felt as though they were getting closer, until we are unable to escape the situation we’ve been thrust into. Also, at times, we can see background characters watching our protagonist without his knowledge. Tension is present throughout, whether it be due to a nervous comment we aren’t sure how to react to, or somebody brandishing a weapon, the audience can rarely relax, leaving you tired when the credits roll.The characters are each rather interesting. Obviously, the family is all rather one-note, but they play that one note so sweetly, I can’t bring myself to complain. The exception to this is Rose (Allison Williams). This character shifts so jarringly, I briefly thought it was someone else in her body. Daniel Kaluuya’s portrayal of Chris was also wonderful, and rather believable. Ultimately, the featured roles stole the show, however. Both Marcus Henderson and Keith Stanfield were brilliant, but Betty Gabriel’s Georgina was flawless. While the ‘saying things in an overly happy way to be creepy’ trope has been played out a bit, the cast in this film manage to make it unsettling again.My main issue with the film is that it doesn’t seem to think the audience is particularly bright. Much of the racial ‘undertones’ are forced upon us, lest we miss the point of the film. There’s also occasional recaps of past events in conversations between Rose and Chris. The audience doesn’t need to be told why something is awkward, or strange; we can work it out. It’s both more rewarding for the viewer, and saves time in the film. This comes to a head when Chris finally works out what’s going on. We see literal flashbacks to previous events, as though we’d have somehow forgotten the things we’d seen half an hour prior.With that said, however, it does highlight something that pleases me greatly. This is a mystery you can actually solve if you’re paying attention. It’s teased earlier in the film that the family’s grandfather was not only a runner, but that he lost to a black man. It’s not too large a leap to find the character’s envy. Perhaps others are like this? We also learn the parents’ occupations rather early, too. The party scene is utterly littered with clues, to the point of it becoming painfully obvious looking back.To conclude, I feel this film was an exceptionally successful film. With a budget of merely 4.5 million dollars, Jordan Peele has told not only a highly enjoyable horror (or thriller, or comedy..) film, but an interesting commentary on society today. It also manages to avoid persecuting the viewer, regardless of their race, as I feared it may end up doing. I am quite happy giving this a high 8/10. If you’re looking for an alternative to a crowd-pleasing horror film such as ‘IT’, I recommend Get Out. At the moment, the film has made a profit of 250 million dollars at the box office, and it deserves every one of them.",

Since this is Jordan Peele’s first film, the movie is hilarious, but at the same time, it’s scary as you watch it. This film is arguably one of the best things I have ever seen nothing like it when it involves the combination of racism and social horror on the big screen. The acting, direction, screenplay, philosophy, and the tone of this movie matched how crazy that film is set up. If Jordan Peele made a sequel or a spinoff of Get Out, the next movie will be even crazier like this one! Without a doubt, this movie is an instant cult classic and a must checkout if you’re willing to see a movie that has a wild of sense of humor taking on social horror and racial tensions.",

I haven't had to walk in the shoes of a minority like that so my view on this is of course from the outside.I don't understand how its determined a comedy/horror movie. There were a couple of amusing parts but the whole thing reads like a horror movie, a very well written, well directed, well acted horror movie.The movie itself is a slow build up from the beginning. The actual action of the movie only starts towards the end, but Peele's story keeps you enthralled anyways. I really found myself liking the main character Chris and I was rooting for him the whole movie. His girlfriend Rosie wasn't my favorite as a character, but the actress did great herself it was just the character I didn't like.The hero of the movie to me though was Rod. He was pretty funny, and maybe that is why they call it a comedy, but I found he stole the show for me.The trailers are pretty straight forward with the story, but you will still enjoy it and there are still surprises. By the end of the movie I didn't trust white people and I pretty much embarrassed to be white by the end, although in full disclosure I don't really trust white people anyways and am embarrassed by them regularly, but that is beside the point.I can't recommend it enough that people should see this movie.The good: I was impressed with how much the story stuck with me. It was full of great acting, directing and writing and I would be happy to pay theater prices again to see more of Peele's stuff if he does this type of horror again.The bad: Nothing bad that I could point to.",
