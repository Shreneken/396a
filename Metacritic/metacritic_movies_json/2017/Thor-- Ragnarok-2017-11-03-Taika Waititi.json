  "critic_reviews": [
    "It’s a movie that, to put it in terms that the film’s screenwriters might appreciate, is Thor-ly needed.",
    "It’s an enthusiastic, hilarious reboot of the idea of what a Marvel movie can actually be, resulting in an effervescent, delightfully self-aware ride that was the most fun I’d had in a superhero movie in years.",
    "This is a Marvel movie that knows when to embrace the ridiculous and when to puncture any pomposity, and it's a delight from start to big finish. And yes, you do need to stay to the very very end of the credits.",
    "Just over two hours of entertaining but profoundly silly superheroism.",
    "One of the many surprising delights in the bright and brassy and wonderfully funny Thor: Ragnarok is the recasting of the God of Thunder as a perpetual underdog.",
    "The third film in the arguably least-loved franchise of Kevin Feige and company’s box office-melting enterprise, it’s also the liveliest, funniest and “loosest” film of the bunch (and that includes Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2).",
    "Thor: Ragnarok is by far the most unusual of the Marvel movies – a crazy, colorful, ambitious, hilarious ride through the cosmos – even surpassing the Guardians of the Galaxy movies as the former holder of that title. And it’s by far the funniest.",
    "Thor: Ragnarok is a much goofier film than its 2011 and 2013 predecessors, and also a better one.",
    "Thor: Ragnarok, the latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is so delightfully funny that it’s almost a shame when the film reverts to its campy, melodramatic roots. Thankfully, that’s not hammered too hard.",
    "Thor: Ragnarok is a blast, pure and simple.",
    "In its own weird little way, Thor: Ragnarok manages to poke fun at the constant churn of myth and entertainment of which the movie itself is a part. It’s a candy-colored cage of delights, but it is a cage nevertheless — and it doesn’t hide that fact.",
    "Though the movie isn’t perfect, particularly in how it underuses some characters and gifted actors, those complaints are easily overridden by distinct moments where charm, oddity, and spectacle collide to create the kind of soul-soaring magic that Marvel at its best is capable of.",
    "This one is probably my favorite, being the most unlike the others.",
    "In a world of portentous blockbusters getting ever darker, it’s a joy to see one throwing on the disco lights.",
    "Ragnarok is both the MCU’s funniest outing yet and its clearest beneficiary of a playful, character-ful director’s voice since Guardians.",
    "The film’s deadpan good cheer makes room for big-budget spectacle and a modicum of emotional depth, but a self-effacing vibe and pop-culture giddiness work the best here — necessary countermeasures as Marvel fights against the inevitable creative fatigue incurred after a decade of multiplex dominance.",
    "Impressively, Waititi manages to retain his unique brand of humour while fulfilling his obligations to the franchise with Thor: Ragnarok.",
    "The greatest trick this studio wants to pull, at this point, is to make more of the same feel either exhilaratingly fresh, or sufficiently retro-inflected to qualify as a nostalgia trip. As both, Thor: Ragnarok counts as some kind of double peak.",
    "The relatively laidback angle on all the murderous spree-ing gives Chris Hemsworth a chance to find the comic groove beneath the title character's beefcake godliness. He does it expertly, and the self-mocking humor is all the more welcome given Thor's essential blandness.",
    "Daft as a badger sandwich and twice as funny, this is vintage Waititi, and the boldest, most outrageously fun film Marvel has yet produced.",
    "Despite the notable camp value of Blanchett channeling Gloria Swanson, Cruella de Vil, and an extraterrestrial succulent plant, the doomy villain thing is rote.",
    "It’s not hard to imagine a young audience completely losing their minds over the thrills and action of Thor: Ragnarok, and then loving it all over again when they realize how funny it is.",
    "A goofy, kitschy- but- fun romp and the most purely entertaining of the three Thor movies, marked by its distinctive designs, ‘80s synth score, and assemblage of spirited characters. It’s carried by the excellent chemistry between Thor, Hulk, and Valkyrie, who give humanity to a visual effects-heavy spectacle that finally makes good on Thor’s title of God of Thunder.",
    "Waititi emerges triumphant, but it’s a nail-biter.",
    "Thor films have traditionally landed with a heavy foot. Thank goodness Waititi taught the big guy how to dance.",
    "One of the silliest and least substantial of recent comic-book movies — a jokey, unapologetically nonsensical romp that makes “The Avengers” look like “The Godfather.”",
    "So it’s uneven, but the good stuff’s unusually lively and buoyant.",
    "This time it’s not too big. Thor: Ragnarok has a lot of human appeal and a spirit of silliness that it never loses and yet always carefully manages, so that the silliness remains an ongoing source of delight without ever undercutting the impact of the action.",
    "They’re called comic books for a reason too many superhero movies neglect. Not Thor: Ragnarok, one keenly aware of how silly all this universe saving stuff is. Guardians of the Galaxy is fun; this movie’s funny. There’s a difference.",
    "The fun here is in the little moments the actors find, and in the way that Waititi, within the massive machine that is a studio superhero movie, brings out a looseness and playfulness in the performances.",
    "Thor: Ragnarok, with its jabs of reportedly improvised banter, isn’t really an action movie. It’s a round-robin buddy comedy, mismatching Hemsworth’s amiable lug to characters old and new.",
    "This is a close-but-no-cigar movie, but so enjoyable for the most part, and so modest in its aims, that its disappointments aren’t devastating. I’d watch the first 90 minutes again anytime.",
    "It’s one of the most refreshing and satisfying Marvel movies in some time, precisely because its willing to do many things that Marvel hasn’t done before.",
    "The whole movie is a grab-bag of insanity so off-the-chain hilarious that you stick with it even when the convoluted plot goes haywire.",
    "Even tonal issues can’t upend the magic this movie taps into putting Thor and Hulk together as new best buddies, whether they’re throwing down in an arena or having a bromantic heart-to-heart.",
    "Ragnarok is basically a Joke Delivery System — and on that score, it works. The movie is fun.",
    "Thor: Ragnarok doesn’t break fresh ground by Marvel standards, but it livens up the proceedings just enough to grease up the wheels of this franchise behemoth as it careens along.",
    "The movie is fun enough, and Waititi shows enough moxie and goofy wit throughout, that instead of feeling glad that he’d been hired to direct the movie, I felt a little sad that he had to bother at all. Meaning: hopefully, Ragnarok will be a big hit and will write Waititi a blank check to do whatever flight of prickly whimsy he wants to do next. For that, it was probably all worth it.",
    "Marvel could have gone grimmer, broodier and sterner, but that isn’t its onscreen way; so it has made Thor sunnier, sillier and funnier. It’s a good fit, at least for a while.",
    "This is a very funny, perfectly scored...exciting, albeit overlong exercise in pushing MCU boundaries to their franchise breaking point.",
    "This movie is so colorful and zippy and packed with outlandish supporting characters, that Hemsworth’s job is relatively easy. He just needs to look great, kick ass, nail the one-liners, and ride off into the sunset (or Avengers: Infinity War, whichever comes first). Thor: Ragnarok is sort of like a giant flatscreen TV hanging on a wall with an enormous hole in the middle of it. The TV is beautiful, but it doesn’t fix the hole. It just covers it up.",
    "In this landscape, it’s rare to get the kind of unabashed silliness Taika Waititi delivers with Thor: Ragnarok.",
    "It’s brassy, breezy and gut-bustingly fun; unfortunately, it’s at the expense of the film’s drama and pathos.",
    "It appears that Marvel has given up trying to broaden the tent. Although Thor: Ragnarok, the third film to focus on the exploits of the titular Norse God, boasts a lighter tone, when the flippancy is stripped away, it’s the same-ole-same-ole.",
    "Thor’s bloodsport detour diverts an inordinate amount of the filmmakers’ attention, and ours, from the whole end-of-days buildup. Hopkins gets short shrift, as does Idris Elba’s returning interdimensional gatekeeper, Heimdall.",
    "Thor: Ragnarok is the flamboyantly roller-disco entry in an already uncomplicatedly cartoonish side franchise.",
    "It’s even dumber than the earlier installments, but it knows it. And the result is some good, clean kid-friendly fun, save for the odd profanity — Odin is known for his curses, after all. Even the killing seems to lack fatal finality.",
    "An excess of levity can quickly become its own kind of leadenness, and for long stretches between its genuinely amusing gags and set pieces, Thor: Ragnarok, credited to the screenwriting trio of Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost, is a bit too taken with its own breezy irreverence to realize when it’s time to rein it in.",
    "Comic book movies have spent a long time striving to be taken as serious, grown-up entertainment but Thor: Ragnarok is almost an admission that you can’t play this material straight. This is probably the wisest strategy with Thor.",
    "Directed by the enormously talented New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi, it’s well intentioned but ultimately numbing, an instance of fun overkill whose ultimate goal seems to be to put us into a special-effects coma.",
    "While it’s not saying much, Thor: Ragnarok is easily the best of the three Thor movies — or maybe I just think so because its screenwriters and I finally seem to agree on one thing: The Thor movies are preposterous."

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nUnder the direction of New Zealand director, Taiki Waititi, Thor: Ragnarok is Marvel's most audacious film in their cinematic universe to date. Not only does it supersede the previous Thor films, but does so in the funniest and entertaining of ways. By far the most unorthodox character change within the Marvel universe, the new direction for Thor is pleasantly unique and sought-after, filled with Waititi's trademark humor and exuberance from start to finish. However, Thor: Ragnarok is more than just a comedic act. There are dark undertones that prevail throughout the core plot of the story, and the fundamentals of a superhero movie are all present. From the opening sequence, the action and visuals are on point, the quality never deterred for a second. And it has now become quite clear that Chris Hemsworth has embraced the role as Thor Odinson, showing off his comedic range and immediately making the character much more compelling than the darker and least fun of the Avengers that we were previously used to. In the film, Thor must prevent Hela (Cate Blanchett) from unleashing Ragnarok, the end of everything, and in doing so, must assemble a team to face her head- on and save the Universe because-as he quotes-\"that's what heroes do\". The \"Revengers\" as he names them includes the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), \"his friend from work\", Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), a hard-drinking former warrior, and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the mischievous brother who no- one should trust by now. And it is not a Waititi film without an appearance by the man himself, which came in the form of Korg, a hilariously voiced rock-monster who was the champion of cracking a joke whenever he popped up. Waititi's style of filmmaking is palpable to the point where it becomes evident that everyone had so much fun making this movie, that is carried through to what audiences were seeing. This is why Thor: Ragnarok works so well and is so fun.",

Chris Hemsworth (Thor) demanded the next film be more comedic and his character funnier, like Guardians of the Galaxy, and it shows on Ragnarok. There are plenty of jokes and running gags, but thankfully not too many as to drag the film down in parody (unlike the Guardians of the Galaxy films). Seriously the film is a joy to watch. A couple of laughs never hurt anybody.The action scenes are amazing and beautifully executed. From the gladiatorial fight between Thor and Hulk, to the fight against Hela and her army of the dead, to the air fight on Sakaar. Special effects abound, and we even see Thor finally mastering his power as the God of Thunder, after his Mjolnir hammer was destroyed.The story is complex but still quite predictable. The movie's plot is a mix of the Ragnarok myth (the Viking equivalent of the End of the World), the \"Planet Hulk\" comic book storyline, and a new enemy, the Goddess of Death Hela, who escapes from her prison and is hell bent on revenge against the House of Odin. After a series of events Thor ends up on the planet Sakaar which is ruled by the Grandmaster who organises gladiatorial fights for his pleasure. Thor has to fight against Hulk to gain his freedom. They both escape from the planet along with Valkyrie and Loki to save Asgard (and the Universe) from Hela's army.But the film's story features plot holes and logic inconsistencies, like, isn't Ragnarok too convenient to take advantage of while at the same time Hela happens to be on Asgard, raising hell (literally)? Still it's a fun movie to watch but I think Thor Ragnarok adds nothing new to the wider Marvel Cinematic Universe (for example there is no new Infinity Stone found) other than introduce the Valkyrie (possibly a love interest for Thor in the future films), the Grandmaster and a couple minor characters. Hela could have been a major enemy of the Avengers but she is no more apparently (you never know whether Marvel bring her back somehow, after all she's the Goddess of Death).All in all, I definitely enjoyed Thor Ragnarok even if it's not perfect. Go and see it, it's great.",

While 'Thor' (2011) was a better-than-your-average introduction to the God of Thunder, many did feel that it didn't spend enough time showing him as such, instead they had to make him human in order for us to get to know him. I liked the spectacle, the emotion and the effort for it... it was an entertaining film, but nothing special. 'Thor: The Dark World' (2013) did have bigger action sequences, and more funny chemistry between the brothers Thor and Loki, but the comedy and final act dragged it down, and became forgettable and uninspired, but I still had some fun with it. So, it's easy to understand that with the third movie about the mighty God of Thunder, Marvel needed this one to be good. And, luckily, with director Taika Waititi ('What We Do in the Shadows'), it seems this franchise has been brought some life. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is easily the best chapter in this saga. It's vibrant, entertaining, action-packed, sometimes dark, and, to many's surprise, very funny. I know the word \"funny\" is odd, since the story of \"Ragnarok\" is meant to be dark and apocalyptic, but the humor does hit when it needs to. We see that Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has been imprisoned, still searching for those Infinity Stones, but as he returns to Asgard, he discovers that his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the God of Mischief, has been ruling the kingdom and Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is nowhere to be seen. They discover that Asgard is in danger when they meet Hela (Cate Blanchett), the Goddess of Death, and sister of Thor and Loki (wasn't she supposed to be Loki's daughter? Then again, Ego was never meant to be Peter Quill's father...), who wants to rule Asgard and banish those who wrong her. Thor ends up on Sakaar where he meets Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), and he is told that he must fight in the arena in order to get to where he needs. His opponent happens to be the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), which is seen as not much of a challenge for him. Thor tries to reason with the Hulk and manages to persuade him to help fight Hela before all of Asgard is in ruins. What makes this movie work is that it seems Chris Hemsworth has more fun in the role of Thor than in previous films. Thor has always been seen as the more \"boring\" Avenger simply because he is an all powerful god who holds a hammer. There's nothing more about him to make him sympathetic, only when he is rid of those powers, does he become interesting. Taika Waititi has a unique vision on the characters of Thor and the Hulk, they really get a chance to shine in this movie than previous ones. They are more interesting here, than before. Plus, the comedy is used effectively. Unlike in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' (2017) where the humor stretches beyond the first act, and the characters joke, even when they're in danger... here, Waititi only uses the humor when its needed. During the final battle, no spoilers, there is little-to-no joking around, especially when the whole world could end. Plus, the replacing of Kat Dennings with the charismatic Jeff Goldblum is also inspired... he is great as the Grandmaster, and I cannot wait to see more of him, if Marvel decides to put him in more upcoming films. Overall, this is a fantastic \"Thor\" movie, and it works because it ticks the boxes that the other two films forgot to tick. Hemsworth really shines as the God of Thunder, and the supporting cast all do a terrific job in their respective roles. It's funny... but not too funny. It's a blast.",

But really,getting out of Thor Ragnarok really made my day,because it was exactly the movie i wanted to see: (Ragna) Rocky,Action-packed,and mostly funny at times.Let's talk about the story...I was blown away. Not by how the story was structured,but because they somehow managed to transform the dark and gritty source material of the comics into a flat-out comedy in the best way possible. What they tried to accomplish in 2h 10m really gave me a huge smile on my face. Oh,and also because we're talking about Thor,which movie-wise,was kind of decent as a franchise (quite frankly). Don't get me wrong,i loved it,but there are some problems with the story. If you already saw The LEGO Movie,well,get ready,because there are so many jokes in this movie that at some point you won't even remember that you smiled. Another problem is Hela. While being excellently played by Cate Blanchett,i was almost going to call her Mrs. Exposition,given the fact that in some scenes it'll be just like The Mummy (2017),where you'll see stuff that sets-up something for another movie.The humor,as i said,was really great all around,and there wasn't a moment where i rolled my eyes or got bored with it. It was some solid humor all along. When the action kicked in,i was amazed by how those were choreographed actor-wise and created effects-wise. You even get to hear The Immigrant Song,which was used in the trailers as part of the \"Hype Engine\".And it was satisfying to see some actors (like Chris Hensworth and Mark Ruffalo) actually breath some fresh air (not the serious fresh air of the comics).So in the end,if you wanted to see a comedy that is really good and not The House or Rough Night,then this is the right movie. Thor Ragnarok deftly pays off itself with a great (mind-blowing for me) story,some funny hints at humor and some of the (not really) best action scenes of the year. And all of this comes out from a Thor movie,so i'm impressed.",

Thor was 3/5 and Thor 2 was 4/5.What's it like?: Packed with surprising things, was very funny, but the final act was sort of OK, not great.Pros: 1) The best part of the film was the Thor vs Hulk fight, particularly the part where Thor has to rediscover himself. 2) The film is super funny.3) The film started well with surprising cameos, links to other MCU characters and a great Infinity Stones-esque reveal.Cons: 1) The final act wasn’t as sharp, doesn’t completely make sense and wasn’t as funny. This seems to be typical of Thor films where the directors run out of ideas at some point in the films.2) Karl Urban’s character, Skurge, was poorly written and poorly acted.How would the the different age groups rate it?Children: (not rated for children)Teens: Average: ExcellentYoung adults: ExcellentMedium age adults: GoodOld adults: GoodRating: 4/5 (no half scores).

MarvelThis might be the absolute worst movie I have seen since Star Wars Episode 2. Never have I seen a company or owner of an intellectual property treat not only the product this badly, but to treat its fanbase like this is astonishing. Marvel took the last decade or so of these movies we've watched and flush them down the toilet with this abomination.Nothing works in this movie, not within the confines of the movie, not within the confines of the narrative of the MCU. When did Thor turn into a stuttering, unsure dork? Why is Bruce Banner suddenly the stereotype of a Jewish guy from Queens? Did every single line have to be humor? Why did this thing have to exist!! It makes zero sense from start to finish. The end of Asgard was a foreboding moment in the age of ultron, one the audience knew to look forward to because of the Epic moments to come. RAGNAROK!!! We instead got campy Flash Gordon with a huge budget. I hated this movie with every fiber in my being. I feel betrayed as a fan of these movies. This epic narrative these movies have been building to is gone with this abortion. It's one thing to poke fun at yourself, it's another thing entirely when you poke fun at EVERYTHING you've done. Thor Ragnarok just unwound this entire franchise for me. The humor was forced, the \"effects\" were bad (The Hela fights were laughably bad. Like Matrix Reloaded bad). The Odin moment was god awful as was the Jane breakup. I don't say this often, but spare yourselves, don't go see this. Easily in my top five worst movies of all time.",

A smart move as his previous two movies have been among the most divisive in the MCU. What we end up with is more Guardians of the Galaxy than god of thunder. Only drenched in 80's neon flair and with a taste for heavy metal.The action is stellar and the sense of humor is the funniest this cinematic universe has had thus far. Waititi proves to not only be more hilarious than Gunn, but more imaginative as well. Ragnarok takes us to surprising new corners of the MCU. Every time I think the world of these heroes can't get any bigger another movie comes out that proves me wrong. Thor 3 is yet another example of that. The expansion on the Asgardian mythology is equally as impressive.The latest events Thor finds himself mixed up in are a lot of fun and filled with memorable characters. Ragnarok has a great villain in Cate Blanchett. Hela? More like hella cute. Tessa Thompson is no slouch either. This movie has the baddest women in superhero history onscreen. The brotherly love and rivalry between Thor and Loki is just as compelling as ever even if it feels like some ground is just being retreaded. What did they do to my boy Heimdall? Elba looking all old almost made me question if he is actually the sexiest man alive. Almost. Kudos to the movie for trimming some of the fat character-wise in the Thor trilogy. I mean, it adds it back on by the end but at least the new guys are much more interesting. Can't forget Karl Urban. So underappreciated as an actor.This is simply an absolute blast of a movie. Kudos to Marvel, Disney, and Waititi for actually bringing some change to the MCU and for finally doing something significant with the Hulk after leaving him in a sort of lame limbo since Incredible back in 2008. It only took them nine freaking years. Ragnarok stands out as the most original feeling entry to date. It's all so boldly done and stylish to boot.9.2/10",

This third entry decides to take a vastlyThor has got to be one of the least interesting Avenger (well maybe on the same level as Hawkeye) and his movies aren't exactly memorable with his second entry being one of the worst MCU movies. This third entry decides to take a vastly different approach and it works. Director Taika Waititi puts a lot more comedy into this movie and adds a lot more comedic personality to Thor. This really makes the movie a very enjoyable watch and some great moments.The plot is relatively simple in the fact that because of Loki taking over Asgard it has resulted in Hela a new threat trying to take over Asgard. Thor is sent to the other side of the universe and now has to rush back to Asgard to prevent Ragnarok. While many synopsis of the plot and even the title itself makes it seem like the stakes are really high. However, in the film it never really does amount to anything and watching it you don't feel like there is really any stakes at all. This is especially because of the fact that this movie is much more comedic and can be a bit jarring. You could go from Hela murdering people to a fun moment with Thor and it makes the plot not seem that important. The characters are great and fun to watch. Thor now has a much more lively personality compared to previous entries and there are some moments where we see more of his character. Still only \"some\" which is really weird considering the fact that his home is about to be destroyed and he isn't as panic as we think he should be. Chris Hemsworth is still a great Thor and while this movie does feel like more of Chris's personality than Thor it still feels natural and gives a much more fun movie to watch. Loki returns and is treated much more of a joke in this movie which leads to some great laughs but you remember that he was the threat that led to the Avengers to Assemble in the first place. Still he does have a pretty interesting character arc in this story and it works quite well with Tom Hiddleston still being an amazing Loki even for the laughs. Hela is the villain of this movie played by Cate Blancett and is the first true female MCU villain. Sadly, just like most MCU movie villains she is rather forgettable and underused. She only has one really cool scene and then is just typical villain of the day which is a shame as there was potential.The stand out of this movie is Valkyrie played by Tessa Thompson who is an amazing badass character and Hulk played by Mark Ruffalo. Valkyrie has a lot of great cool action moments and Hulk just steals the scene every time and since he can speak this time it leads to great moments between him and Thor. Though Hulk isn't in this movie for as long as you think he is which is a shame but understandable since this is a Thor movie still. Jeff Goldblum is the grandmaster with a lively personality and is great in every scene he is in and Karl as Skurge is pretty good as well with his own believable character arc though a relatively small role. Taika Waititi the director as Korg was also very funny as well. The best part of this movie is the amount of colour and design that goes into the sets. Clearly this movie took a lot of inspiration from Guardians of the Galaxy and it definitely shows, They both explore the cosmic side of the MCU and are much more focus on the comedy. The design of the sets though have a Jack Kirby feel to it and that is very fitting for the planet of Sakaar. The action scenes are also very good especially the Thor vs Hulk fight with its great choreography and comedic timing. The action scenes are much more memorable then Spiderman Homecoming and are much more enjoyable to watch in my opinion. The score while not super memorable, still does its job and led zeppelin \"immigrant song\" is a great song.Some critics say this movie sets a new standard for the MCU and I honestly don't agree with it. I think this is a really good movie and is most definitely the best Thor movie. However, it does have the feeling of a typical MCU movie. It takes many tropes that have happened in the MCU and amplifies it. This really worked for the movie and creates an enjoyable experience for us. This movie is what we loved about the MCU and that is why it was such a good movie. The fault for this movie is that it doesn't really go in a new direction and still has the common flaws of a MCU movie. Still, if you liked many of the MCU movies then you are going to really love this movie as it feels like a love letter to us fans.",

Instead, we have a joyful, colorful action-packed film that is easily the most fun I have had watching a movie in a long time. It is pure joy. Too many things are perfect but a shout out to the use of Led Zepplin’s Immigrant Song and director Taika Waititi as super friendly rock monster Korg.The Bad: Nothing. Seriously nothing. Okay fine the use of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory’s Pure Imagination is a little on the nose. There is also a realization while watching that not enough films have Jeff Goldblum in them… does that count as a negative?In Conclusion: Thor Ragnarok is simply the most fun I had at the movies this year. Dunkirk is a slightly better film and there are certainly more “important” films out there but this was pure joy. Imagine a comic book movie that felt like reading a comic book.

After seeing Thor and Thor: The Dark World, I had taken the assumption that Thor moviesAfter the release of Infinity War, I had begun bingewatching all the MCU movies. And I'm not gonna lie to you. I wasn't feeling like watching this movie. After seeing Thor and Thor: The Dark World, I had taken the assumption that Thor movies are always bleak and lifeless. They always try to be serious when they can't possibly do it when they have characters like Thor, Loki and Odin. And so when it was time for me to watch this movie I was very reluctant, because I knew I can't skip it. But I'm glad I sat through this movie, because it was a huge improvement.The movie started out in Asgard, from the point where Thor: The Dark World left (and honestly the only thing I remember about that movie). The way that movie had ended, I had thought this movie would build more on Loki pretending to be Odin. But that ended immediately. Instead this movie focuses on Thor and Loki's estranged sister Hela, who had been abandoned by Odin at a young age. She easily manages to defeat both Thor and Loki and sends them to exile on Sakaar, with Thor reaching the planet two weeks after Loki. That was the part where the movie skyrockets the interest. I like everything about it movie from a cinematic point of view - the CGI, the acting, the comic timings, the story, the dialogues. Everything is absolutely perfect. I could undoubtedly say that this is one of, if not the best superhero movies which is not an origin story but rather a continuation of events. The comedy of the arc is the selling point. My favourite dialogue was the rock guy saying, \"I planned to start a revolution but didn't publish enough pamphlets so hardly anyone turned up.\"After Thor, Loki, Hulk and Valkyrie come back to Asgard to stop Hela we get the best CGI ever witnessed with Thor. I really like how his eyes glow whenever he has to shoot lightning. I always wanted him to be like that. Thor really had a very drastic character development. I know many people have said this - he lost his father, learnt about his sister, his friends were killed, his precious hair was cut by none other than Stan Lee himself, he continuously got taken down by Valkyrie and lost against Hulk, his entrie planet got blown up and his people encountered Thanos in space. And yet this was the funniest MCU movie yet. And not just Thor, every scene that had Loki in it was always interesting too.However, this movie was obviously not without its set of flaws. For starters the elephant in the room, the amount of exposition that was given throughout the movie was too much, with most of it never being mentioned any time afterwards. There was even a scene where Thor is explained everything about Sakaar on a virtual trip, but it was never talked about afterwards nor was it necessary. If it wasn't for this unnecessary padding of runtime, I'd have given it 10/10. The Planet Hulk arc was also quite unexplored from the comics, and it would have been great if they made a spinoff movie on Hulk also since Hulk has never been given a solo movie starring Mark Ruffalo. Then the biggest plot hole, Valkyrie electrocuting Thor also didn't make sense since Thor is literally the God of Thunder and he shoots lightning from his hands. And then when Hela pins Thor he gets the ex-machina of his father telling him about his superpowers.Thor: Ragnarok is an excellent MCU movie. It's kinda sad that this can't be enjoyed unless you've watched Thor: The Dark World and Avengers: Age of Ultron. Because it could have really been cool to show to someone who has no idea what the MCU is all about. It does have the good reward to it, since you can watch Avengers: Infinity War after it.

Kudos of course should be given to its stellar supporting casts, the usual suspects such as Hiddleston and Rufallo, but also 'newcomers' Tessa Thompson and Cate Blanchett. Biggest weakness?

Just like Luke Skywalker, Odin is still off the Asgardian radar. While Thor and his fallacious stepbrother Loki move to Earth to discover the whereabouts of their father, Hela, their cruel (step)sister, a powerful goddess, rises up from the ashes of the past to send, by force, the pair of brothers to Sakaar, a planet ruled under the jolly way of acting of the Grandmaster, in order to get the throne of his former nation, Ragnarok. To address this, He will face a staggered succession of mishap without his legendary hammer, making use exclusively of his worldly abilities and picking up on the way an irreverent and irregular group of allies who crave, from the deepest part of their hearts, to eliminate vile Goddess of Death before it is too late. Narratively, \"Ragnarok\" possesses heroic avant-garde conjunctures, such as introducing the very first bisexual character within this mega-franchise, fencing two characters in the same Roman war area, playing with more than one antagonist in the same plot, going for broke to cut main hero's powerful blonde long hair, changing abruptly settings by amusingly ordinary circumstances that are poured into utopian and fantastic molds as the coexistence of our stouthearted superhero with a sour-faced roomie into a galactic apartment for a few days, holding dear really the possibilities that comic books have and hundreds more that enable the feature film to differentiate itself radially from the multitude of film genres Marvel Studios has managed to run.Perhaps most of the spectators don't agree with my perception, but, in personal terms, visual imagery and artistic work exhibited in the film did not impress me as I expected.Marvel has assumed the hard task of distinguishing, thoroughly, every of its film ideas in any of the work fields, either frictions lying in the lexicon of characters, the distinctive nature of them, the film genre or the artistic scenarios that serve as a home for the stories. \"Ragnarok\" was advertised as a deluge of colors and hilarious events — both in its narrative strangeness and its splendor in film execution — never seen before; the posters have been one of the best among the competition and the trailers had a high expectation, in fact, this was fulfilled, however, it worked as a desired allergen for me. In short: \"Thor: Ragnarok\" is like eating up your favorite candies without any limit, after an hour, you're terribly cloyed. Color saturation, paraphernalia and spectacularity attempt to fill a lack of real new landscapes, imaginations that are absent, bombarding with color and artistic eccentricities to excess. Analyzing the sound condition, the feature film seems to have been produced by a mix of talents between Edgar Wright, James Gunn, and Mark Mothersbaugh. Under a prominent influence of classic hits of yesteryear, Waititi's movie promised great things in regard to the original motion picture soundtrack, including, as a starter, no more no less, that Led Zeppelin's revolutionary \"Immigrant Song\" as a fundamental music accompaniment at the first official trailer, a song that also mean a key point in the closing colossal bout. Garnished by compositions created explicitly for the film, the flick switch between classics and proper musical creations at a good pace, it ranks third in the top list of the best scores in the MCU, a merit achieved even though when they aren't entirely original sounds.No doubt, the main cause of the triumphant revival of Thor is thanks to this funny filmmaker— an adjective justly gained. Sinewy God of Thunder has passed through the hands of Kenneth Branagh  and Alan Taylor , however, neither of the two didn't get the opportunity to draw forth his potential in all its splendor, a flaw faded only until the nifty and creative vis comica of the New Zealander emerged as a genuine elixir of life to the character. Without fear of being mistaken, in the marrow of every fascinating feature is this proficient director, his diversity of ideas is absolutely comedic and his film determinations fit in the profile he desires for his projects with great diligence. By dint of a sharp, irreverent and daring perspective, this man has raised a pic of interesting properties, with a heart and a dramatic weight that exceeds in size and visual quality the creative display.In sum, \"Thor: Ragnarok\" can be synthesized adequately in a brief and exciting name: Taika Waititi— of course, not downplaying the fabulous work done by the different areas of the film. Hilarious, visually oppressive and entertaining, Marvel Studios remains high on its prestige as it prepares for a wave of spasmodic and challenging releases, Among which stand out its very first motion picture starring an entirely black cast, its film with a female in the stellar role and the mega-event that will mean \"Infinity War\" when arrives our hearts in May 2018.",

I did laugh in the theaters as I saw it. So if you are looking for pure laughs and just a chance to see some old characters again the movie is fine. All the director wanted to do was make people laugh and he achieves that. Its a weak goal for a superhero movie, but I give him the credit he did what he set out to do. This movie is funny and that's where it ends.I love the MCU and had such high hopes for this film, Thor's story (not necessarily movies) is one of my favorites in the MCU.  I thought that Ragnarok would take us on an epic journey to save the fate of the Nine Realms, but it did not.Ragnarok has entirely too many jokes for something about the end of the world. Ragnarok refuses to take the event or the characters seriously. There are so many emotional moments that need to happen in this movie that don't happen.SPOILERS:During the death of major characters there is hardly any emotional response from Thor or Loki or the people of Asgard as a whole. The forced relationship between the villain and Thor and Loki is unnecessary, Hela did not have to be their sibling. It could have easily been that she was a rogue warrior, Odin's first wife or even Odin's sister. The fact that they make her Thor and Loki's sister undercuts the relationship between Thor and Loki. The heart of the Thor story is the bond of brothers having Hela come out of nowhere just doesn't add to the development of the main relationship in the Thor arch which is Thor and Loki. She is a good villain though, but she doesn't need to be related. It's forced for shock value. Then it comes down to the biggest issue I have with the movie is the complete lack of development of Characters.  Thor's character has regressed.  He was supposed to become wiser, but he's actually become quite dumb.  He was supposed to become stronger, but he's actually become quite weak... he can't hold his own against the villain and instead of gain strength and confidence he actually becomes weaker. He is no threat to the villain and the villain knows it. He can't save his people and he knows it.  That is rather disappointing for a hero. Also Loki's character, one of the most compelling characters in the MCU who had a beautiful arc gets watered down. His powers, intelligence and personality get watered down. I wanted a cathartic moment between Thor and Loki when they reveal that they need each other and miss each other, but instead everything is played for laughs. Loki's character never had to make a choice to do the right thing... we don't see motivation or the sympathetic emotions that make this character so well loved. The movie is funny, but its no substance. I miss the old characterizations. I miss the poignant emotional moments that Thor and Loki's relationship offered. But the director got what he wanted he made me laugh in theaters and then when I left he made me cry.",

It has a lot of very funnyI'll preface this review by admitting that I do have an odd sense of humor, so that is probably why Thor: Ragnarok was right up my ally since director Taika Waititi seems to have a similarly odd sense of humor.  It has a lot of very funny moments - some are fairly obvious that everyone in my theater laughed at, while others are a little more subtle and require that you've seen other MCU films as they take shots at and make of fun stuff from them, specifically Age of Ultron.  Chances are that if you enjoyed a lot of the \"off the cuff\" / kind of subtle humor present in the first Guardians of the Galaxy, chances are you are going to like Thor: Ragnarok.  At its heart, this is very much a buddy film (with Thor/Hulk and Thor/Loki), but that is part of what made it so enjoyable.  A lot of the best scenes are back and forths between these characters, but it does more to build on their relationships than a lot of the other \"solo\" character MCU films to date.  They were honestly the high point of the movie as it kind of tailed off as the story turned towards the ending (see below for my only complaints with the film).In terms of why I didn't give the movie a perfect score of 10 (it came close for me), I really had two main bones to pick with it so to speak.  1) Like a lot of other MCU films, most of the movie centers around the heroes so I can see some feeling this is yet another example of an MCU film not devoting enough time to build up a villain in Hela (played by Cate Blanchett) that otherwise had a lot of potential.2) I thought the ending seemed kind of abrupt and rushed.  As I've told friends and co-workers who've asked, part of that may have been the result of the fact that I was enjoying the rest of the movie so much that the ending might  have snuck up on me somewhat.  But there are some...what I'll call \"actions\" I guess taken by Hela (against some of Thor's allies) that I thought would've been better saved for the end as it would've made Thor's decision about how best to fight her carry more meaning.  I don't want to say too much more than that as it would take this review into spoiler territory.All in all I really enjoyed the movie and definitely recommend it to anyone that enjoys the MCU (even though it is not your standard superhero movie), and also anyone that is a fan of movies like the original Guardians of the Galaxy that are part space opera / part comedy.  I liked it enough that I would put it among my top 5 MCU films to date (with the first Iron Man, the first Avengers film, Captain America: Winter Solider, and the first Guardians of the Galaxy), though I do expect it will likely be surpassed when Black Panther (which is reminding me a lot of Winter Soldier) and Infinity War are released next year.",

TheI watched this film yesterday, I headed into the cinema not knowing what to expect, but I was blown away by this film. This is definitely my favourite MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) film, albeit for the two Guardians of the Galaxy films. The story kept me hooked, throughout the entire film and I never wanted to miss a moment of what was going on, due to the fast flowing motion of what was actually going on. The comedy in the film was fantastic, with plenty of jokes the entire cinema, full of both kids and adults, burst out laughing, although personally I did laugh out loud much more than anyone else. The action scenes in the film were very well written and I was in awe at the fantastic CGI. The inclusion of The Hulk was remarkable, as he had a much more important role than what I'd expect him to have from all the trailers I'd personally seen, and The Hulk was a very nice inclusion into the film. The lead villain, Hela, was one who I loved to hate and the fight scenes with her in were both intense and comedic. The film is a perfect lead up to the new Avengers Infinity War film coming out next year, and if that film manages to blend in comedy, action and story as well as this film did, we should all be very excited!",

At times Thor:Ragnarok seems a bit far-fetched and ridiculous. But,perhaps, my biggest problem with this movie is that it has a great tonal discrepancy.

I’ve often admired how Marvel Studios has been able to take the seriousness of these fantasy stories and fuse them with the comedy of its characters and situations to find a perfect middle. Some are more serious than others and some more comedic, and you will find fans on either side of the spectrum. Thor: Ragnarok was not balanced. If you’re looking for a fun ride than look no further, but if what you’re after is an intriguing storyline, serious acting, or even some great battles then look elsewhere.Speaking of acting, I loved Cate Blanchett as Hela, but the threat of her character and overwhelming power never seemed serious. Obviously you can guess that the heroes will most likely win at the end of the day, but when you make it so blatant it really steals away the threat. When it came to the action I was let down as well. There were the start of some very good scenes, but none of them could stay serious for longer than thirty seconds, if they even managed that long without a one-liner or pokes at superhero tropes.The scenes where we did see the darker and grim side of events felt rushed and after thoughts, almost as if the director had to put them in, but only to get back to the humor. Once I found out Taika Waititi was the director, whose previous work includes What We Do in the Shadows it made a little more sense. It truly felt like one big joke, but if you like your comedy you’ll probably like this movie. If you’re a hardcore nerd who seriously debates who would win in a fight between Thor and Hulk, don’t get too excited. This film felt like a side story within the Marvel universe and one I hope that was meant to be the comic relief in the long line of more serious titles. A great comparison to make within the Marvel family would be that Thor: Ragnarok was the complete opposite of Logan. This film had jokes from the first line to the last. The serious fantasy and science-fiction fanboy part of me wanted to attack this movie, but even I can enjoy a pure laugh fest from time to time, as long as this doesn’t become the norm.FILM INFO:Genre: Action, Adventure, ComedyDirected By: Taika WaititiWritten By: Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle, Christopher YostRelease: Nov. 3rd, 2017Runtime: 2h 10minStudio: Marvel",

They already know their formula and it seem like they aren't willing to change it.As I said before, Ragnarok it's very different from its predecessors, now the focus of the story is centered on the adventure and the comedy, an irreverent tone that will divide the fans, after all many of them are expecting something darker and they aren't getting it.Taika Waititi manages to impose his personality as a filmmaker and in the process he also gives one to Thor who frankly never showed an evolution since we saw him for the first time. It's true that it tries to make him more humorous and it's not a bad thing but let's say that in that department Mark Ruffalo takes away the protagonism when he makes his appearance.Loki's reappearance is welcomed but unfortunately he feels more collateral than ever before on front of the rest of the characters because those who have the most attention are Thor, Hulk, Valkirie and Hela, played by Cate Blanchett who manages to create a very good villain, although it's due more to the enormous talent of Blanchett than to what the script provides for her.In the most strict sense, Ragnarok delivers what was asked of it and what it's offering, which is entertainment, a entertainment with action and doses of comedy that will undoubtedly be more than enough for any fan.The tone, the performances, the story, the production, the score, the effects, everything is first level and as I said it will be enough for anyone who continues enjoying these films without any objections, I'm also a comic book fan and I enjoy this movies a lot, nevertheless I also love movies and I must be analytical in that aspect.I don't really have arguments to say that Thor: Ragnarok is a bad movie and although it changes the face of the character, it does not change it to the Marvel franchise in general and that honestly as a comic book fan and a movie lover it bothers me, it bothers me when conformism has become the norm instead of the exception.I'm frustrated that Marvel does not want to innovate anymore and it's sad considering that although they did not bring superheroes to the movies, they do gave them another face, another level and they took a risk when nobody in Hollywood did it with those characters, that's what Marvel should do if they really want to continue for another ten years or beyond.I judge this film with more fierceness because it's the third MCU film this year and the other two did not move or change the formula at all, considering that we are less than eight months before the premiere of its greatest epic, the project they've been cooking for the last six years, indifference and complacency cannot be accepted as standard.Thor: Ragnarok is not a disappointment, it's not a bad movie, it's a fun, graceful and entertaining film, it's worth your time and it's even more if you've already have walked all the way of the MCU, it's a solid entrie, superior to its predecessors and I must say that currently it's the second best movie of Phase 3.Any day, go watch it, you'll have a great time.",

The third Thunder God movie brought a new gas and a new vision to Thor's films, managed to hit on several points with scenes and fantastic scenes and actors actress that fell perfectly in their characters. Thor - Ragnarok was able to reconcile and balance well the scenes of comedies and the dramatic moments the scenes in Sakaar were fantastic the scenarios although a little different from the BD they were perfect the scenes of comedies were good of more (In Sakaar they abused of the comic part) and framed in the perfect moment, throughout the film has several more jokes this does not disturb in the part more serious and in the moments of drama, if in Sakaar was fun in Asgard you feel something quite different a heavier climate with a good dramatic charge. The fight scenes are sensational and the effects were nicely worked Hulk VS Thor was fantastic an unparalleled fight the two battling yet swapping huge blows that make it vibrate with each hit. The scenes of Hela's fight are perfect, Hela (risk telling me that she is the best villain of the UCM) proved to be an overwhelming, deadly and cold force capable of great feats bathing Asgard in blood, it was unstoppable neither Thor, Valkyrie, Loki and others were a match for Hela. Valkyrie was a very well-developed character in the story you can rightly understand her story there in a way yet noticeable race has brought us strong and a powerful cream warrior. The film was very good but still has its low points more comprehensible as in the beginning the fact that we see Sutur as a primordial threat is more quickly forgotten throughout the film, but the motive should be at the end of the films for the purpose that he carries in order to everything else still should be used more.",

And the actor-protagonist has the one who is, shot, his best moment within the Marvel universe. It delights to see!Among many surprises, I highlight the performance of the talented Tessa Thompson. And this is doubly positive, because she took the role discredited by those who complained about climbing a black woman to do a valkyrie of the Norse mythology and ended up proving more than worthy to embody the character. She is an expressive actress, talented (to me, surprising) for humor (I did not expect her to do so well), to dialogue and to trickery, interacting very well with others. There's no getting around that cliché comment: she STOLE THE SCENE on several occasions.The rest of the cast is great too. I call attention to the muse Cate Blachett, charming and GODY in every way; for Tom Hiddleston / Loki, still being that mix of villain and anti-hero we love; and to the director himself, Taika Waititi, who, in addition to directing, played the excellent Korg, a stone giant who is a mix of simplicity, ingenuity and loyalty - perhaps my favorite character in the film.As an unconditional lover of the 80's, it may be unnecessary to say how much I LOVED the visual aesthetics (Flash Gordon, Jack Kirby, although this second reference is older) and the synth-pop soundtrack (made by the vocalist of Devo, a new wave band from that time). Palms to the director, who took all of this and tapped the blender, serving a delightful dish to otentistas like me.Another very positive point is that trailers and commercials have, for the most part, VARIOUS scenes that do not exist in the film (or, at most, present them at different angles, with different dialogs etc.), which shows that Marvel learned not to overexpose his lengths as he did with Ultron's Era. Soon, that prediction (mainly of haters) that \"who saw the trailers and commercials already watched the whole movie\" is very stuck here.",

That said, I really liked this movie.  This is my favorite Thor movie so far.  They still are all seriously flawed.  I thought the comedy was done well.  There were some truly funny moments.  The good part of Thor is they allowed him to be Thor with his powers throughout the movie.  However, I was generous and subtracted only 1 star for taking Thor's hammer away from him for 95% of the movie.  This isn't a spoiler since they do this at the beginning.  Would it kill Hollywood to let Thor have his powers and his hammer during an entire movie?  If they do one day, it will become a Thor blockbuster movie.  I must say Cate Blanchett was spectacular as the main villain in the movie.  She should get an Oscar nod for this.  She looked like she enjoyed playing as Hela.  Minus one star for not having enough of her in the movie.  She won't get the Oscar nod since they didn't give her enough time in the movie.  They get a great villain and then underutilize her.  Shame on you Hollywood.Jeff Goldblum does another great job at the movies.  He was a lot of fun to watch as he ruled as supreme leader and Tessa Thompson was excellent as the brooding Valkyrie who needs her passion roused to find herself again.One day, I would like to see Marvel and Hollywood make a serious Thor movie.  Just recreate the story from one of the classic Thor comics and run with it.  Is it that hard to figure out how to draw Thor's legions of fans to the theaters over and over again???

If you're like me and generally believe every super hero movie is a failure except the Dark Knight trilogy, then don't see this movie. Like all super hero movies nowadays, it features a new villain that is hell-bent on taking over the universe, while recycling older side characters from previous films in the Marvel universe to aid the protagonist. Some of the cameos in the film (both by actors and characters) are quite nice and funny, others are awkward (as performances). Also, the whole act where the super hero acts like he doesn't really care and just jokes around is getting a bit overplayed, and when done in this movie it made me cringe on several different occasions. The movie featured some humorous moments that I thought were well done, but they don't make up for the overused plot, average acting, and underwhelming effects (the effects were what I was most disappointed in). Overall it wasn't worth the money to me.",

The one thing that made him Thor was the Shakespearean way that he talked. That was not found in this movie.Sure it's better then the rest, but not great. There's no point of where you could relate to what he's going through since they put a joke on everything. It's a good one time movie.",

There are moments where named characters die and where cities are destroyed, and those moments are immediately followed up with a one-line quip. The humor was actually pretty good, but it is so jarring to have emotion/tension filled moments just immediately under-cut with jokes that make light of character deaths. I always liked that Thor was more of the straight man in the Avengers, but this time around he's playing for a laugh in every scene. I liked Cate Blanchett's villain, and her backstory was interesting, but her motivation was just as bland as every other villain these days. She hints at some interesting stuff about Asgard white-washing its history to hide the past cruelties, but that never creates any conflict between Thor and Odin/Loki. Jeff Goldblum's character was fun but underused, Tessa Thompson was good but underused. I just feel like if the movie had gone for a bit more heart and a bit less comedy then this could have been another Iron Man.",

The Thor Franchise (And \"The Incredible Hulk\", to be fair) has been rather forgettable and OK at best. \"Ragnarok\" definitely changed that. The third trilogy of the OG MCU squad delivers in action, comedy, and story line. Not only is this one of the funniest MCU installments, but also one of the best. The cast is excellent. Seems like Marvel is getting every A & B list actors possible. This time, they brought in the likes of Cate Blanchett, Tessa Thompson, Karl Urban, and Jeff Goldblum (!) to join the already crowded cast (Hemsworth, Hiddleston, Elba, and Sir A. Hopkins, plus Ruffalo). They all shine in their respective roles. The character Valkyrie makes fans demand her own movie, for good reasons.Not all the humors work, but when it does, it's really funny. And unlike most MCU movies, Ragnarok is quite colorful (Just like Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2). The ending surely makes us extremely hyped for the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War movie. Oh, and there are some surprising (And hilarious) cameos too. Don't miss this movie, go watch it!",
