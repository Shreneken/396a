Mitsuha wakes up in Taki\u2019s body, and he in hers. This bizarre occurrence continues to happen randomly, and the two must adjust their lives around each other. Yet, somehow, it works. They build a connection and communicate by leaving notes, messages, and more importantly, an imprint. When a dazzling comet lights up the night\u2019s sky, it dawns on them. They want something more from this connection\u2014a chance to meet, an opportunity to truly know each other. Tugging at the string of fate, they try to find a way to each other. But distance isn\u2019t the only thing keeping them apart. Is their bond strong enough to face the cruel irony of time? Or is their meeting nothing more than a wish upon the stars?

    "critic_reviews": [
        "Given its nonlinear structure, Your Name requires your trust, but once you place your faith in screenwriter/director Shinkai\u2019s expert hands, the reward will come. (Not surprisingly, the film is the fourth-highest-grossing film in Japan\u2019s history.)",
        "Prepare to be spirited away. A brain-scrambler to make hearts swell, Shinkai\u2019s giddy romance brims with emotion and invention.",
        "Part body-swap comedy, part long-distance romance, part... something else. If you only see one Japanese animated feature this year, see this one, and see it more than once.",
        "The only way to understand it is to swim in it for yourself, feel your own heart braid around these two interwoven lives, and gaze up in awe at the silvery arc those falling stars trace across the sky.",
        "Your Name is the kind of film that\u2019s all the more striking for how easily it could have gone awry, but Shinkai has accomplished something unique and genuinely special here.",
        "Shinkai\u2019s film opens up from cute stranger-in-a-strange-body antics and expands into a philosophical and metaphysical parable about fate.",
        "Taki and Mitsuha think they're dreaming, and after about the first 40 minutes of their shimmering film, you may think you are, too.",
        "Makoto Shinkai's lush mindbender Your Name has many elements that are familiar on their own but here combine to create something unique.",
        "The movie\u2019s spirit is by turns energetic and serene, impetuous and wise, its wild shifts from comedy to tragedy to romance revealing themselves not as tonal swings so much as variations in a larger cosmic pattern.",
        "There\u2019s never been much more than a fringe audience for anime in the U.S., which suggests that Hollywood might not be long in taking a live-action shot at this story. But whatever the budget, whoever the stars, they\u2019ll have to go some ways to top the magic managed by artists and their brushes spelling out Your name.",
        "Shinkai unleashes a twist early on so clever and cerebral that J.J. Abrams and Christopher Nolan will kick themselves for not thinking of it first. That twist turns things from a teen film to an adult film.",
        "It\u2019s a beautiful, captivating piece of work that gets off to kind of a rocky start but achieves remarkable momentum toward an emotional, powerful ending. And you won\u2019t see a better-looking animated film all year.",
        "The beauty of Your Name is that, as in the best animated movies, the thin black lines of the character design invariably dissolve, and all that remains are Taki and Mitsuha, thoroughly mixed-up teenagers.",
        "Perhaps a less uplifting ending may have seemed more honest. But Shinkai\u2019s a romantic at heart, and it\u2019s infectious. By the end, you just want these two crazy kids to get together, no matter whose bodies they\u2019re in.",
        "This is a film which handles its high concept with confidence, and a winning balance of comedy and emotional punch.",
        "This vividly realized and emotionally satisfying feature ought to make Shinkai a household name \u2014 certainly in Japan, and with any luck, in other countries as well.",
        "Although there are times when the story loses its focus (mostly during the scattershot and occasionally confusing second half), the overall impression is one of satisfaction and the animation is better than anything to emerge from Japan since Miyazaki \u201cretired.\u201d",
        "One can see the influence of Hayao Miyazaki here \u2014 this is way more \u201cSpirited Away\u201d than \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d \u2014 but Shinkai also goes off into his own, weird direction.",
        "Like all of Shinkai\u2019s films, the richness of the light coats everything it touches with such an evocative hue of nostalgia that the plot only puts a damper on things (and there\u2019s a lot of plot here).",
        "For all its entertaining novelty, it is still many steps behind the magic, penetrating insights and profound humanity of the Japanese anime pantheon lead by Hayao Miyazaki and Mamoru Hosoda.",
        "There\u2019s admittedly a certain pleasure in the deft fake-out that Shinkai executes here\u2014most viewers will automatically make an assumption that\u2019s ultimately proven wrong\u2014but it comes at the cost of overall narrative incoherence.",
        "Being cluttered isn\u2019t the only problem with Your Name. It also features insipid characters and dippy montage music from the J-pop band Radwimps.",
        "Even at its most outrageously bizarre, Your Name is bound together by a passionately romantic core.",
        "This thoroughly emo body-swap fantasia, a sizable hit on home turf, demonstrates that [Makoto Shinkai] inherited much of his [Hayao Miyazaki's] artistry and charm, but not yet his narrative mastery \u2013 nor, crucially, that magic that distinguishes lasting artworks from well-drawn \u2019toons for teens.",
        "Your Name is still highly watchable, even when this mystical Young Adult love story cloys \u2014 or confounds.",
        "That\u2019s a lot for a viewer to take in, and as pleasing as some aspects of Your Name can be, there\u2019s no question Shinkai\u2019s overstuffed movie often trips over itself."

The animation is so beautiful and detailed, the score is wonderful and once the story really kicks in the script subtly shifts in tone from comedy/drama to melancholy.

It is like aRelated media: This Japanese anime film is based on the manga of the same name, but I haven\u2019t read it. >What's it like?: A comet passes over Japan and the lives of two people are inexplicably linked while a disaster impends. It is like a cross of two film tropes, the first being body-swapping between two people, seen in films such as Freaky Friday and Like Father Like Son, while the second trope is a spoiler. ### Move to the next paragraph now to skip this spoiler. ### The second trope is seen in a Korean film called Il Mare and its American remake called Lake House.>Pros:>1. The concept of the film is rather complex as it merges Japanese culture and its beliefs with the tropes of body-swapping and one other sci-fi trope that is a spoiler. As a result, it is a film that requires a bit of attention. However, the reward at the end is well worth it. If you are into those three elements, then you\u2019ll love this film. However, see Cons #1.>2. I saw the American animated film, Sing, a day after watching this. The gulf in the complexity of the artwork is immense. For example, for a tree, you will see the outlines of the tree, the branches and the trunk in Sing, while the same tree in Your Name has individual leaves. Imagine the effort required to hand draw these. Imagine the effort required to animate them when there is wind! Everything is so beautifully drawn!>3. The use of the second trope in the middle of the film elevates this film from an average-good film to a good-excellent film.>4. Comedic elements covering childhood fantasies, high school angst and dating difficulties were used throughout the film to make this a partial comedy. They are very well done and they break the language barrier for the international audience.>Cons: >1. The complexity of this film makes it harder for younger children or older adults to understand it fully.2. The major problem close to end of the film was solved with a dues ex machina that was not properly explained. It need not be that way.>How would the different age groups rate it?Children: GoodTeenagers: ExcellentYoung adults: ExcellentMedium age adults: ExcellentOld adults: Good.My rating: 5/5 (no half scores). It's worth it to watch it in the cinemas and then buy the DVDs.",

I absolutely adored this film.  Director Makoto Shinkai gives us an excellent movie, that you can probably nit-pick, but I felt the raw power and emotion in this film and you can tell that Shinkai has done a loving job crafting this film.  Many people have put a lot of emphasis on the body swapping element of the film, which is very well done, but I think it also has the effect of cheapening the rest of the film which is also done brilliantly,  It\u2019s a story of love, regret, and overcoming disaster and adversity and finding the solution when it seems impossible.  It\u2019s one brilliant film and if it doesn\u2019t get a nomination for Best Animated Feature at the Oscars, I will be extremely annoyed.  I\u2019m really looking forward to whatever Makoto Shinkai brings out next since this beautiful animated film is easily his best work to date. Oh and the soundtrack released by the band The Radwimps is fantastic. It\u2019s not currently available, but it will be soon.

One is a boy who lived in Tokyo and has the word \"city\" described all around him. One is a girl who lived in rural town far from technology and anything interesting. One morning, somehow, they found out that they have swapped bodies. Together, they must help each other find solution in daily life problems, and solve the mystery of the reason why this whole conundrum started.This may sound like your typical body-swap romantic comedy situation, but you may find yourself on the wrong side of the spectrum as this movie takes you into an incredible journey. With a storytelling so divine, complex, yet understandable, this movie captures the essence of what romantic comedy movies have lost nowadays, a heart and a charm to lure you in.Japanese animation movies tend to have a bit of a stereotype, but the movie successfully shown very little of that. Transitioning from one scene to the other effortlessly, Radwimps deserves an incredible applause for their talents in the movie, as every song and every score fits perfectly to the scene currently shown.Although the movie does end in a predictable way, the voyage to that predictable end is more than enough to keep you satisfied. There are some usage of stock characters and several clich\u00e9s throughout, something that maybe will drive some of the audiences away or cloud their judgment. But beside all that, the story is still original and well executed.What seems to be a silly premise evolved into something even more trifling.

I went into the film with a very little understanding of the plot\u2019s complexities. From the trailer, I assumed Your Name would be an anime Freaky Friday love story. The framework of the narrative certainly fits into my initial assumption. Yet, there is a multitude of undercurrents in the film which make Your Name stand out. For starters, Your Name constantly changes themes and mood. Often, I found myself laughing and, a few minutes later, would suddenly be on the verge of tears. The movie\u2019s eclectic flow makes for a constantly engaging experience. The Freaky Friday element is roughly half of the film\u2019s two-hour runtime. In fact, a plot twist in the film literally took my breath away. Your Name is the rare film which combines overwhelming variety and makes everything fit organically. Through variety, the anime earns a conventional ending between protagonists, Mitsuha and Taki. While body switching is the plot's main intrigue, the film adds complexity through its exploration of Japanese culture. Japanese gender identity is explored with such a masterful hand. In subtle strokes, the viewer understands the sheer contrast in the lives of Japanese men and women. For example, a group of men have a crush on a female co-worker; Mitsuha, in Taki\u2019s body, simply initiates conversation with the desired woman and, with ease, sets up a date. When Taki is back to normal the next day, his male coworkers all line up disgusted by his act of group betrayal. The scene effectively demonstrates the strength of the herd like quality of gender in Japan. It\u2019s no surprise then when Taki, in Mitsuha\u2019s body, finds such humorous wonder in the breasts he suddenly gains. A contrast can also be noticed in the struggle between the past and present. The present is Taki\u2019s experience of Tokyo. Likewise, the past is illustrated by Mitsuha\u2019s familial duty to her small town\u2019s local shrine. In other words, the film merges Japanese spirituality with modern sensibilities. A desire to escape and return to the country define the film\u2019s ecliptic take on Japan. Mitsusha is your typical country girl with a thirst for a life in the city. Meanwhile, Taki finds beauty in Mitsuha\u2019s country town. The viewer amusingly experiences each setting (Tokyo and Itomori) through the unique lens of the protagonists. Ultimately, a comet and local god guide the distant figures into a surprising collision course. As a result, fate is sealed by the two somewhat metaphysically dissimilar sources. The forces of science and divinity augment Your Name into making the seemingly fated connection all the more plausible. The film is a testament of the \u201copposites attract\u201d sentiment. In summary, the film has a real beating heart. I will end my review saying Your Name is the best looking animated film I have ever seen. The colors are always pleasingly vibrant. Additionally, all of the scenes are lovingly rendered and pulsating with life. I haven\u2019t walked out of a theatre with such a positive perspective on life in a long time. If you live in a city, you ought to take the time to experience this anime masterpiece.",

Because people know what these guys are capable of. This is one per cent sci-fi and 99 per cent fantasy. The concept is not new for us. From 'Freaky Friday' to 'The Lake House', even the recent American television film 'The Swap', you will remember a handful of names once you read this film's synopsis. Yet the film was so good, because of how well the theme was utilised.We all know the technical brilliance of '5 Centimeters Per Second' and the beautiful romance from 'The Garden of Words'. This is an excellent mix of those two. If love either of them, or both, then you will love it as well. But if you ask me, my favourite is still 'The Garden of Words' from this director. I liked this film, enjoyed thoroughly, so liking it less than that means not a bad flick. Surely a film to recommend for anime fans, as well as for animation's (western audience).The story of two teenagers, one from the rural Japan mountain region and the other one from Tokyo. The plot revolves around a comet that is to pass by very close to the earth. But before that event, the girl is bored with her life, so she dreams of living in a big city and that too as a boy. One day her wish comes true when she wakes up as she swapped bodies, including most of the memories with a boy from Tokyo.For her, it is to live as she wanted and make use of the opportunity. But for him, it is like a curse, hence becomes rebellious. This thing keeps happening frequently for days and weeks. After some times, realising the phenomena is between two, they make a deal and strict order of Dos and Don'ts while away. All this until the day of comet and everything changes forever. Searching for the truth and the result of it leads to the end of the tale.\u275dTreasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up.\u275eUnlike Miyazaki, Makot Shinkai's storytelling is quite for the matured audience. It targets adults more than the children. Particularly for not shying away to include naturally occurring events in such situation as the story develops, despite/even though the film revolves around the teens/kids. As for this flick, the concern is not big, but it depends on the nation and its culture you belong to. It is very much acceptable and as the story progress, the best things keep replacing another till the finale. So hooked to it is assured.The film length was good and so the pace of the narration. Well written screenplay, which was based on the book of the same name. But the director admits the inspiration from the previous flicks with similar themes. They have used the real places of the anime version with fictional names, but most of the Tokyo remains same and they all were awesome.In many scenes, the camera panning was a treat. Especially the framerate was high, so no jerks, hence very pleasurable visual experience. Like I mentioned earlier, this is a unique film, despite not a original idea. The film proved the Japan is not overshadowed by Hollywood, particularly after the decline of animes in the recent years. It's up to the quality of the product, if so, then those glory days can be brought back for animes. Anyway, now this film holds the record for highest grossed anime.Apart from technical dominance, the story is also enchanting. If you like romance theme, this will serve you well. A good film for date night. But usually people would skip animation for such occasion and one should not mix up that with anime. Because why I always put apart the anime and animation is, the animes are good at beautiful romance, while its counterpart from the west focus more on comedy and adventure. But the common thing from them is the well explored fantasy theme.Usually the ends are guessable for a film like this and the same case for this in here. Only as a result of the story, you would know what's coming, but not the frame by frame scenes of it. Yeah, I liked this conclusion, the final lines said might bring you tears in your eyes, romantically, if you are an emotional person. One of the best endings, even though it was clich\u00e9d. And the credits start to roll up, while you begin to recall everything you just saw in the last 100 minutes. A must see film, so highly recommended by my side. Now I've to wait for another couple of years for such film.8/10",

Not only does the film manage to out do western animation by miles, but it also manages to have an amazing story with characters who are easy to release to with both characteristics and emotions. The animation is wonderful, and looks for better than most of the generic looking CGI that Disney and Dreamworks use to death. It also doesn't force political beliefs and any forced usage of \"progressive characters of colour\" that most animated films are pushing these days. It's the simple lives of the characters in this world that are relatable unlike SJW disasters like Moana who push a perfect little princess character that nobody can relate with.Simply put it, the film is great.

The characters voices fitted them perfectly! I was loving it so much and hoping the movie would end perfectly with the typical happy ending where they'd remember each other, just to make my night. But of course, in a realistic setting that fitted the characters relationship and personality. However, I reached the ending and I couldn't be any less disappointed. It basically left me on a cliffhanger that I knew would never continue. Very, very slim chance! The fact that the two main characters had finished off the movie seeing each other, passing a few times making my heart drop every time at the chance of the movie ending with them not saying anything at all. BUT they did speak! ENDING IT WITHOUT FINISHING THEIR SENTENCE! And the fact that I knew it was a slim to no chance at all that there'd be a part two made me even more devastated. The two characters saying \"Your name is...\" and having the view moving towards the sky and ending there made me angry, annoyed, sad and devastated. However, other than that the movie was amazing and 10/10 would highly recommend this movie, that is if you aren't as sensitive about movie endings like I am.

It also manages to highlight the contrast between living in Tokio and living in countryside, teach a lot about japanese traditions, have a few smart twists and tell a compelling love story.

But then, I thought I should stop to consider the complaints surrounding the film,Subtle and nuanced, but with the emotional weight of a sledgehammer, \"Your Name\" hit me so hard so many times that I was tempted to award it a 10 right away. But then, I thought I should stop to consider the complaints surrounding the film, and how many of them I consider to be flaws. I was also surprised to read director Makoto Shinkai personally request people stop lauding the film with blind unconditional praise, explaining there was more their team could have achieved with more time and money. After considering these things, I'm inclined to agree with him, but that won't stop me from praising the film as it is; I can definitively say this is Shinkai's best film....of little shock I'm sure is the premise of Your Name. It starts out as a sort of Teen Dramady with a body switching twist, which is quite a creative way to tell a love story I must say. Even without many scenes of the two protagonists together, you start to buy into their romance nonetheless, because when you consider they have been living each other's lives, you realize they must know about each other in ways no one else does. Eventually, they naturally decide to seek each other out, and it's here the film cleverly switches genre's. To spoil this first twist would be wrong, but it's the first of many times the film really hits you in the feels. From there, much more is at stake than the simple love story, yet Your Name manages to put equal emotional weight behind an impending tragedy and the protagonists' fear of losing their newfound connection....The story is solid, but it does suffer from the short run time. At some points, the director even had to resort to montages over what would have been important character development; presumably to save money. The exposition in the film is quite substantial, and while much of it is necessary, I wish there was a way for some of it to have been relayed in a more organic way. If you don't have your wits about you while you watch this film, especially as a Westerner with limited understanding of Eastern Religious beliefs, (Shinto in this case,) you're not going to hear the things you'll need to understand the film's climax and resolution. In this way, the film makes your brain work harder than a typical cinematic outing....As one final flaw, the male protagonist Taki felt quite underdeveloped compared to his female counterpart Mitsuha. He had few character defining traits shown, besides a moment where his short temper shocks classmates of the normally reserved Mitsuha. His relationship with his father in particular wasn't explored at all, when it should have been. We know some things about his interests and lifestyle, but again, little that could be considered character defining. We know far more about Mitsuha as most of the screentime is about her. A more balanced development would have been better....With flaws out of the way, and there weren't many, I still fully recommend this film to anyone interested in Anime. Its strengths far outweigh its problems. The animation, for one, is immaculate. It really serves to compliment the story visually, even if that story isn't as fully developed as it could be. While the pop singles were somewhat distracting due to the vocals, the soundtrack as a whole is solid. I thoroughly enjoyed hearing the movie as much as watching it. I mentioned the film is emotionally heavy. Well, it's hard to explain, but imagine that feeling of loss when you risk losing someone near to you, that feeling of familiarity even though you can't specifically remember someone or something, and that teenage impulse to escape from your boring secure life and live out something more exciting. Those are the feelings this film invokes, and does so quite well. To go into more detail would take too long, so please just trust me on this....Also, unlike several of the director's previous films, Your Name has a satisfying ending. I was afraid we'd be left with another \"5 cm per Second\" kind of ending, but am glad to report the film ends conclusively. For me, it's complete as it is; I don't want a sequel. What I really wanted then, was more out of this film. It really needed another hour to develop the characters and story further, but Shinkai can hardly be blamed for this, considering he seems to feel the same, but ran out of time and money to do so. Well, if this is what he can accomplish in a mere hour and a half, I can't wait to see what he'll achieve if given the creative freedom a larger budget would allow. Definitely keep an eye out for more films by this director. 9/10",

The tension I felt at the end of the movie, and the emotional release at the end felt epic.  The movie kept building up, and while I agree that Makoto Shinkai might have been able to make this movie even better, I still give this film a 10.  His only competition in trying to make a better movie would be himself.  I'm sure there are some that may not enjoy the subject matter, or may not like the concept, but I thought this was beautiful, awesome combination of some of my favorite plot devices/situations - one of them being two people swapping bodies, but it really got crazy as the film kept going.  I think this one is worth watching more than once.  3 movies I watched years ago had elements which were recaptured and reused in Your Name.  Freaky Friday (which really doesn't have much else in common except two people's minds switching bodies).  The Lake House, which involves two people communicating with each other but never meetings and (major spoiler) communicating between different time periods.  And Memento - which takes some re-watches because it's presented out of chronological order, or in a non standard order of events, and also involves writing things down in places so you can remember, and forgetting things very quickly.   I loved all these elements of Your Name.  It also have a gigantic, and devastating explosion, feels like every movie could use at least one, for dramatic effect.  The movie had humor, it had romance, it brings a sense of longing, it had some great music, and amazing animation, both the character animation, the camera/motion effects, the scenery. I'm a huge fan of Miyazaki movies, and for a very long time Studio Ghibli was my gold standard of anime, it's the best of the best quality.  Makoto Shinkai has impressed me time and time again and this was the absolute best I've seen from him.  Fantastic movie.  And he, in my mind, is standing alongside Miyazaki in greatness.",

It wasn\u2019t a typical boy meets girl, they actually played with that trope a lot with this film along with successfully managing to mess with the audience\u2019s perception of events. This movie has a lot of aspects to draw people in. Kimi no Na wa has romance, supernatural elements, some time travel. They all come together to give a very impactful and interesting story. The movie doesn\u2019t drown on too long and doesn\u2019t grow boring. The movie opens up immediately into the plot which causes viewers to question what is going on causing them to become engaged in the story and wonder where all the plot points are going. I highly recommend checking this movie out as I believe it has a little bit of something for everyone. Interesting plot development, good character dynamics, and a heartwarming story. Funimation has announced that Kimi no Na wa(aka Your Name) will be released in North American Theaters on April 7th, 2017. The film already premiered in 2016 at Anime Expo in Los Angeles. I believe this is where I will take my leave folks. As always, I am The Gentleman Snark, SEE YA!!",

The protagonists' reactions are so lovely that they grew on me in no time.Your Name's pacing does an excellent job at this - it gives the characters and (almost as prominent) sets enough time to fully develop, but also drives breathtaking action. Combined with the gorgeous soundtrack and brilliantly used nonlinear narration, it keeps both heart and mind engaged. The stunning visuals do the rest. And of course, at some point it will hit you right in the heart.While some parts around the middle may appear a little contrived, and the mixing time lines can create some momentary confusion, the clarification and payoff always come in due time.Your Name musters all the strengths of anime as a medium, and their makers expertise. Now, Tearjerkers like this will always have to justify themselves against accusations of being formulaic, as romance writers (especially in the anime industry) have all too much experience manipulating our emotions. But Your Name manages to always throw a little extra in there, and executes everything with breathtaking perfection. In a movie year where so many seemed to stumble even over the basics, it is good to see a movie that just does things so right. In a time where CGI has blurred the characters of Hollywood productions into one, it is fulfilling to see such wonderful art. Your Name was my movie of the year before I was even half way through, and only grew from there.",

I did watch that movie as well, mainly for its music and for the scenes and ending. Now, for Kimi No Nawa, it illustrates how we feel on certain things in life, how will never see that person, or wanting to see that person. That really goes on saying that these certain movies can touch on our hearts, but no one can really see this. Cause most people in the world don't have our tastes, some do, but not at this extent. But mostly, Your Name goes on to keep us watching over and over, and to appreciate it's style of writing and pleasure. Even though Makoto Shinkai couldn't handle the praise of his own movie, he has to understand that we relate to this kind of situation, and some of use knows how we feel when we knew somebody, but never got to talk or see to that person again. Shinkai really shows everything in his mind on what he imagines. I want to do that myself when I get into that kind of work for my story, but when making a story/storyline, you have to Brainstorm for hours on end on what goes here and there, and having to lay out characters for certain events. Shinkai did great, he warmed my heart from this movie, and gave me chills, especially with the colorful and vibrant environments in this film, I wish he realized his achievement, and stopped doubting himself, why don't people just accept the fact they've achieved something great or accept the fact they have to do this or that, and put everything you have into it, you don't have to give up on something hard or not worth doing,.

I think it has so many good elements that make this movie as good as it is. First of all: Gorgeous. It has some great animation and the backgrounds look stunning. This movie looks beautiful. I was amazed the whole movie by the insane amount of detail every frame of this movie has. If this movie got something right is the presentation. You have to be a hater to deny that. The score for the most part was beautiful and fits the movie really well. However, the movie has some really bad music at times. For example, at the beggining, during the \"opening\", the music that was playing was like a really corny pop-rock song straight out of the 2000s, and to me, made the opening feel really cheesy and left me a bad first impression. There are moments in the movie where, instead of using more of that beautiful score, they decide to put more pop-rock music. It kinda ruined the tone of the scene. But it is not a really big problem, because, like I said, for most of the movie, it has a really good score. Other thing I really liked is the writing. The dialogue and the way the characters are written, specially character interactions, is really good, and the twists and turns were well executed and turned the movie in something I wasn't expecting. Speaking about that, that is both a praise and a criticism, because if something doesn't let this movie get a 10/10 from me is this:IT'S TOO COMPLICATED!The story is just too hard to swallow. While not incomprehensible, this movie was something I wasn't expecting: Complicated. Now, don't say I'm a braindead retard because this movie is too smart for me. I think it is the subject matter what really makes this movie really hard to follow. (Kinda spoiler) A movie about this crazy sh*t of alternate universes and time travel and all that is kinda hard to write because there is a 99% chance that you will make something that, either doesn't make any sense or too complicated.I know that there are articles on the internet that explain the movie but really I don't feel like reading them.

Though this film is visibly beautiful, the concept of switching bodies is made complicated by the overabundance of body switching and lack of plot motion within some of their \u201cswitches\u201d. The art and animation flows beautifully together. There\u2019s plenty detail to look at in any scene. Settings feel complete and alive. If you\u2019re looking for a film to put on as more of a screensaver, this would probably be my first recommendation.The character depth doesn\u2019t go far beyond Taki being a stereotypical boy and Mitsuha being a stereotypical girl. I felt more intrigued in the lives of Mitsuha\u2019s friends and family than in Mitsuha herself. All other unmentioned characters are simply forgettable with no substance. (Oh, and Ms. Okudera was okay.)The music is unfitting for many situations it\u2019s placed in. It seemed forced into climactic scenes where music shouldn\u2019t have thrown emotion onto the viewer and would better have been portrayed through visuals alone. It would have been possibly better if there were more orchestral pieces, but instead the soundtrack ends up being an annoyance more than a merit due to feeling shoehorned in.The conclusion didn\u2019t feel worth the frustrating amount of build-up present throughout the film. I understand that sometimes subtlety is best for a conclusion, but there wasn\u2019t enough of an ending to justify all that the characters have been through for the ending we got.Your Name ends up being a constant frustrating tease. While the art is astounding, the movie doesn\u2019t feel like a complete package. At its core, it wasn\u2019t fun to watch due to uninteresting main characters and a plot so convoluted it\u2019s hard to comprehend what\u2019s going on at almost any time. Instead it\u2019s just a pretty mess.",

Yes the animation is beautiful but it can't tell the story. \"Your Name.\" is just a bad taste anime to entertain the audience, and show how Makoto lost his own vision and style to made a popular popcorn movie (like Michael Bay did). The thing I can't stand the most is how the people keep hyping this movie (even Makoto told people do not go to the theater watch this movie). The main characters are empty. They didn't have a real interaction, I cannot understand why the people think this is emotional. Okay maybe the emotion doesn't really need to be rational  but I hardly feel the characters' mind. At the end, the story cannot express any feeling (the music is not suitable for the mood too).In conclude, the whole anime is disappointing.

I am a huge fan of anime but I never really bothered to watch your name despite all the hype because of other commitments. The premise of the movie isYour name was one of the biggest Japanese animation movies to come out in the last decade. I am a huge fan of anime but I never really bothered to watch your name despite all the hype because of other commitments. The premise of the movie is \"Two teenagers share a profound, magical connection upon discovering they are swapping bodies. But things become even more complicated when the boy and girl decide to meet in person\". I finally decided to watch this movie and wanted to see if this movie was deserving of its hype.Firstly, the animation and art style is so beautiful. Every shot in this movie is visually striking and it is very clear that the director (Makoto Shinkai) and his team were thorough in the detail of Tokyo and the rural countryside. The setting of this movie is based on the real world but it is so gorgeous to look at, that it feels magical. Every little thing in this movie is just so visually pleasing from the skyscrapers to the forest to just the characters eating; it's stunning. This movie was definitely robbed by the Oscar for not even nominating the movie. The music is also done by a Japanese band call \"Radwimps\" and it is phenomenal. Their songs are perfectly utilised in the movie and perfectly represents and elevate the emotion of the scene. It's surprising because using vocal pop songs are usually jarring but Your Name does it in such an effective way that the scene wouldn't feel the same without it. The story within this movie sounds cliche with the body-swapping but the way it is executed is so fundamentally different from anything Hollywoods done that it feels unique. Mitsuha is the girl who lives in the rural countryside and is a shrine maiden but wishes to live in Tokyo. Taki is the boy who lives in Tokyo who is a talented artist aspiring to be an architect. They both end up randomly swapping bodies which results in them having to discover why this is happening but also learning about each other along the way. The situation leads to them dealing with each other problems but also discovering more about themselves. Mitsuha and Taki wouldn't interact normally but this event leads to them creating a bond where they both would be irreplaceable to one another. Romance movies are not something I am fond of but Your Name kept me emotionally invested in what was going on. There is some laugh out loud moments that are expected of body-swapping but there are some serious, suspenseful and even genuinely heartwarming moments that tug at my heartstrings. The director masterfully inserts these clashing tones and makes it fit together to complement each other.  There are some twist and unconventional ways to body-swapping done in this movie that sets it apart from other romance or body-swapping movies. On top of that, the characters are absolutely loveable with their quirky personalities. There is also supporting characters who are the friends of Mitsuha and Taki who are just the best people in the world. Overall, the movie is such a wild rollercoaster of emotions. There were so many moments where I was screaming internally because I was so invested in these characters and their situation. The constant message of searching for something or someone is the theme of the movie and it shouldn't resonate but it does. All of this leads to a satisfying finale that by the end I've felt rewarded. I've never been so engaged in a romance movie until Your Name. The fantastically beautiful animation that is weaved together with a very human story with likeable characters leads to what may be the best animation movie in the last decade. This was a sensational experience that everyone should experience themselves.",
