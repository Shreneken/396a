    "Before the jacked-up antics get to be too much, director Tony Leondis and co-writers Erich Siegel and Mike White get in a few satiric licks at a technology we've all come to call home.",
    "The Emoji Movie proves unable to provide even a modicum of content capable of capturing or retaining the attention of an adult. Nap time.",
    "Despite the talents and charisma of its voice cast, The Emoji Movie fails to deliver on any of its intended messages or themes, with a final act that goes back on everything it had originally been trying to say.",
    "There have been worse ideas, but in this case the execution isn’t good enough to bring the notion of an emoji movie to funky, surprising life.",
    "If not always imaginative or digestible, the look of the settings and characters should keep kids awake for 86 minutes; and if the trick that eventually saves the day makes very little sense to critical moviegoers, at least it's cutely frantic eye candy.",
    "But a cluster of screenwriters found barely a single laugh in this wayward tale of a “Meh” face emoji in search of reprogramming. Not a one.",
    "The Emoji Movie could not be more meh.",
    "There was probably never going to be a version of this film that would prove even remotely plausible as a movie someone felt passionately about making for artistic reasons; as far as expanding on smartphone-related IP, this is an even weaker starting point than Sony Animation’s recent The Angry Birds Movie.",
    "The most distressing aspect about The Emoji Movie is that a spectacle this self-evidently soulless no longer feels like a new low. It doesn’t even leave a dent.",
    "As dismal to contemplate as it is persistently horrendous to even look at, there aren’t enough Patrick Stewart-voiced emojis in the world to express what an ugly, artless exercise this is.",
    "While it's tempting to sum up in thumbs down emoji, when they go low, we go high. So let's just say, abandon all hope, ye who enter here.",
    "Stupid, offensive and as substantial as a text message, this toxic piece of kiddie trash isn't worth the pixels.",
    "The Emoji Movie is a force of insidious evil, a film that feels as if it was dashed off by an uninspired advertising executive.",
    "A work so completely devoid of wit, style, intelligence or basic entertainment value that it makes that movie based on the Angry Birds app seem like a pure artistic statement by comparison.",
    "There is virtually nothing in which to emotionally invest.",
    "The Emoji Movie’s most insidious trait is its surface-level innocuousness.",
    "The film is boldly bad, yes, but also boldly boring.",
    "The Emoji Movie is a waste of time, resources, and a bunch of comedians’ voices, plus a premise that actually had the potential to do some small good in the world. It’s less of a movie and more of an insult.",
    "A film as mindless and disposable as most smartphone apps — and nowhere near as addictive — Sony’s animated The Emoji Movie is a calamitous comedy that inadvertently shows how difficult it is to pull off the witty, imaginative world-building that Pixar makes seem so breezy.",
    "There are plenty of words that can describe The Emoji Movie. Here are a few of them: Unfunny. Saccharine. Nonsensical. Painful. And, of course, crappy. (If you prefer the poop emoji, that works too.)",
    "Any pretense of storytelling gets thrown out the window as our emoji crew stops to play some quick nonessential games of Candy Crush and Dance Now, which basically act as elaborate commercials for apps desperately trying to hold onto their waning relevance.",
    "Please restore my eyes to factory settings. They have seen The Emoji Movie, a new exercise in soulless branding, aimed primarily at little kids.",
    "To add to the pain and despair of the experience, The Emoji Movie is preceded by a short, “Puppy,” featuring the characters from the “Hotel Transylvania” animated movies. It is also idiotic.",
    "It is one of the darkest, most dismaying films I have ever seen, much less one ostensibly made for children.",
    "The only thing worse than the dialogue is the absurd product placement.",
    "It is a soul-crushing disaster because it lacks humor, wit, ideas, visual style, compelling performances, a point of view or any other distinguishing characteristic that would make it anything but a complete waste of your time, not to mention that of the diligent animators who brought this catastrophe into being."

I am not even kidding, the plot, if you can call it that is interrupted constantly for adverts for products such as Drop Box, Twitter, YouTube and even the Just Dance game.  I am not even joking, for no reason, the plot is interrupted for an advert for a mobile version of Just Dance.  Everyone in this movie is terrible, they are all giving awful performances, including smug performances from Anna Faris, T J Miller, especially James Corden, who seems to be in every terrible animated film I am watching at the minute, playing the exact same role every time and in this film, he is incredibly annoying.  The jokes are never funny, the animation is obnoxious and there is no real message to it whatsoever.  Kind of ironic considering it’s a movie about emoji’s.  This is one of the most cynical things I have ever seen aimed at children and the fact that this film is aimed at children is the most disgusting part of it.  The film also has no original idea whatsoever, ripping off other more successful family films constantly, especially Inside Out, Wreck it Ralph and Toy Story, doing it in a way that required no effort at all.  You will want to slap some dignity into Patrick Stewart for playing the pooper emoji and I would like to point out the opening credits say Sir Patrick Stewart, Robbie Collins summed it up better in saying the opening credits might as well have said “yes, we have ruined this man’s career”.  Everything about it is everything I despise about cinema:  no effort, product based placement throughout the Wazoo, no originality, mugging actors constantly giving off the impression that they know what they are in is terrible but they don’t care as they got an easy pay check and an attitude of “that’s good enough for them”, which cinema should never have!!  Before you say anything, the opposite is just as bad, I hate films that go “if you don’t get it you are obviously an idiot”.  So don’t accuse me of being elitist for my opinions on this film.  It’s just crap and anything in the comments section for this review that have any emoji’s in are getting deleted instantly.  I am sick of them now and if I ever see a copy of this film, I am going to set it on fire.  I HATED THIS MOVIE!!!",

I have never before felt this way about a film, but this movie was\"The Emoji Movie\" is maybe one of the most perplexing pieces of media I have ever borne witness to. I feel strange saying this, but this movie was written... incorrectly. I have never before felt this way about a film, but this movie was written wrong. The worst part isn't even the fact that the main characters are representations of things as characterless as a coat rack, it's the fact that the film doesn't know what it wants to be. This movie has a bizarre tendency of making overly cynical jokes, yet presenting them in such a way that children are guaranteed to take the wrong message. For example, the phrase \"Words are lame, use an emoji\" are presented at a certain point to the user of the phone where the eponymous emojis reside, yet this phrase is not balanced in any way by a differing perspective, a sarcastic glance, or any similar method of showing that it was a joke. This happens multiple times throughout the film. It is also worth noting that pretty much every line spoken by the \"Jailbreak\" character seems to be there just so they can consolidate the female gender into a marketing tactic like they did with \"Ghostbusters\". Thankfully, it doesn't work at all, and just makes a few scenes a lot more awkward than they would have been normally. I recall actually pausing the movie when she said the line \"You know men are always taking credit for things that women come up with\" after the main character figured out what her reasoning was and confirmed that he knew what she was talking about, not at all taking any credit for what she was saying.In terms of the rest of the movie, I feel bad for anyone who paid to sit through 2 hours of advertisements for dropbox. I almost didn't expect it to be as bad as it is. For a film which prominently shows spam emails as a recurring joke, it sure does present a lot of its own spam. Another pause moment happened when the main characters escaped from a villain by going into dropbox, to which the girl replied \"It's illegal malware, and this app is secure!\". I believe I could feel my brain slowly melting out of my ears when that statement was made.While I didn't enjoy this movie, it is kind of a shame that it had to be this way. A lot of people probably didn't like this movie solely because it was essentially a drawn-out advertisement for smartphone downloads. The problem is, there is another movie that is essentially one big advertisement for products, yet it's one of the best animated films I've ever seen! If the people making \"The Emoji Movie\" had taken any inspiration from \"The Lego Movie\", we could have had a potentially amazing film! It is especially depressing since the animation in this film is as good as it could be, being wonderfully stylized and moving beautifully. All in all, \"The Emoji Movie\" is maybe one of the most depressing pieces of cinema I've ever seen. In terms of recommendations, if you are a person who likes to tear films apart, I would recommend watching this film once and never again. To everyone else, avoid this film like the black plague. It's bad for you and terrible for your kids.",

We'll witness these poor excuses for characters visit Dropbox, YouTube, Spotify, and a few others. Now, this could have been a cute thing, but the implementation isn't clever or inventive. Nothing in The Emoji Movie is. The stale quest about being true to who you are is not only devoid of originality, but heart as well. Every emoji and phone creature thingy is a bland stereotype meant to carry the almost non-existent plot forward. Things get weird when it tries to preach feminism and has weird symbolism on things like divorce. It never manages to actually say anything about them, but you can tell they're there. Because, you know, I'm sure that didn't go over the heads of the 6 year olds in the audience out there. The ones that were scarred for life by their first truly abysmal movie.What tiny bit of imagination it does have is only present on the surface level and is meant to cover up a rotten core created by a group of morally bankrupt individuals that created this film to exploit children in order to prey on the wallets of their unsuspecting parents who didn't know any better. The Emoji Movie is a humorless romp through cellphone land that is devoid of joy and personality. Don't watch it and certainly don't let it near your kids. That would be child abuse in my book.

Miller) Who Has Other Emotions Besides “Meh”. The Film Takes Place In Textopia Which Is Essentially The Environment For The Emoji Characters. The Emoji’s Must Stick To Their One Emotions And Cannot Feel Any Other Emotion. Eager To Fit In With Society With The Other Emojis, Gene Recruits The Help Of Best Friend Hi-5 (James Corden) And The Code Hacker Emoji Jailbreak (Anna Farris). Together, They Go On A Mission Through The Apps On The Phone To Find The Code That Will Fix Gene. But When A Greater Threat Threatens The Phone, The Fate Of All Emojis Depends On These Three Unlikely Friends Who Must Save Their Environment Before Tt's Deleted Forever. Not Gonna Lie, I Wasn’t That Interested In This Film In The First Place. This Movie Is Utter Garbage And Just A Cheap Cash In At The Soul Sake Of Selling A God Damn Product.Acting/Characters: The Acting Is Terrible, And The Characters Suck And You Just Don’t Care About. The Main Characters Are Annoying And I Just Them To **** Die Already. The Villain Is Non Threating And Comes Off As Annoying. Patrick Stewart Plays The **** Emoji Which Is A Completely Waste Of Talent Nuff Said There. Not Even Him Could Save This Thing.Writing/Pacing: The Writing Is Just Utter **** The Humor Is Lazy, The Jokes Are Cringe-Enducingly Terrible. This Pacing Is Way Too **** Long. It Is Only An Hour 26 Minutes And Feels Like It’s Going On Forever And My God It Is So Boring! I Realize It’s A Kids, But It Doesn’t Have To Insult My **** Intelligence. The Jokes Are So Mindless And So **** Stupid. It’s Just LAZY! LAZY LAZY LAZY!!!!! There Is No Reason For This Movie To Exist. The Plot Is Just Stupid And Goes No Where. There Is Barely Any Time And Effort Put Into To It. NONE Of The Jokes Are **** Clever At All. It’s Generic And Overall The Writing Is Just Terrible. The Film Ends With You Guessed? Yep. A **** Dance Sequence. The Idea That Drop Box Is An Important Plot Point In This **** Movie Is Stupid. The Mindless App References Were Tedious. It May Have Tried To Be Clever But It Failed MISERABLY!!!!Animation: Animation Is Garbage. It’s Flashing And It’s So **** Bright It Makes My Eyes Wanna Bleed. That’s How **** Bad It Is. Trust Me It’s That Painful.Overall Opinion: This Movie Is Utter Garbage And Just A Cheap Cash In At The Soul Sake Of Selling A God Damn Product.

The story, if you can call it that, is literally a shot for shot remake of Inside Out, just without any form of emotion thrown into it. And you know when you failed that aspect when the main stars of your feature are actual emotions, or Emojis in this case. The movie's sense of humor is just plain unfunny throughout the film, and the characters have already been done in other, better movies. The biggest example being Jailbreak. However, while the writing is abysmal, the animation is not. It's really colorful, how the animators design and animate the Emojis and the apps is pretty creative, the animation when in the human world is decent, and the effects of things being made out of little cubes like fire, debris, and the upgraded bots is a nice detail. So, all in all, the animation is not half bad. But then you realise it's not half good either. Some of the character designs look weird, like on Smiler, the textures of the emojis' hair looks honestly out of place, and again, some of the app designs have already been done in the past.

The movie had more product placememts than you average commercial breaks for a 3 hour sporting event. The characters are one note, the humor is extremely unfunny, and it takes itself way too seriously. I thinm I made this review to positive.",

The entire time I was watching it I was feeling real life pain due to some of the most cringey, depressing, and unironic writing I have ever seen in a blockbuster film. The half-baked social commentary was both unintelligent and by-the-numbers when it came to feminism, being who you are, and honesty in relationships; but the downright glaringly awkward issue of the role of technology (or even product placement) in our lives was lost on the makers of this fine movie.",

The film, for those unaware, doesn't fall under the category of \"watchable, disable fun\" that was Sony's prior animation attempt, The Angry Birds Movie. No - this Emoji story is far below that - into the land occupied by Disney's lackluster direct-to-video sequels and other junk that no one cared to see. The fact that this is getting the attention of cinemas and audiences worldwide is hard to believe. The Emoji's famous cast can't even manage to save it - Patrick Stewart, even, in all of his glory. In the end, however, The Emoji Movie's lack of messages and themes for kids to walk away with is the most surprising. Even Angry Birds found something to say. Finally, my message for you is simple. Just avoid this crap - please.",

'The Emoji Movie'There are no words to describe how bad this movie is... in fact, there are no emojis to describe how bad this movie is... not even the \"poop\" emoji is insulting enough to this film, since he is one of the main characters... 'The Emoji Movie' is the worst movie of 2017 so far, a film so bad and so joyless, I gave it a \"Zero\" rating. A rating I very rarely give, unless it's to 'The Room' (2003) or any of \"The Human Centipede\" films. This film has joined that club. The film (if I can even call it that) follows an emoji named Gene (voiced by T.J. Miller), who lives in Textopolis, a world found inside of a smart phone. Gene is the son of Mel Meh (Steven Wright) and Mary Meh (Jennifer Coolidge). Gene feels that he can be useful when he gets work, but when given the opportunity, when the phone owner sends texts using emojis, and Gene is selected, he is often unsure of what to do, and tries to what he can at the last minute. This ends up wrecking the text centre, and Gene feels responsible. We meet a handful of other characters from; Smiley (Sean Hayes) to Hi-5 (James Corden), and more depressingly so, the legendary Sir Patrick Stewart voices the Poop emoji. Good to see that he has moved up in his career, especially since he co-starred in the excellent 'Logan' (2017). There is so much to talk about with this so-called \"movie\", but honestly, this is awful. Why even talk about it when nobody, in their right mind, would see it either alone, or with their families. There are five top reasons as to why this film is the worst of 2017... 1) Bad writing, 2) Horrible animation, 3) Lack of storytelling, 4) No compelling characters and 5) Bad pacing. The movie's pace is so uneven, I found that it dragged towards the third act. How could so many talented actors from T.J. Miller (who was hilarious in 'Deadpool) to Sir Patrick Stewart get involved in this trainwreck? It tries to be like 'Inside Out' (2015) in regards to the premise (emotional characters inside a tiny world)... but I had a headache watching this turd, and I'm sure nobody else will see it too. Let's hope this movie does not influence more like this in the future. One \"Emoji Movie\" is bad enough.",

Although the movie was complete garbage, the animation was exceptionally good which is why this doesnt get a 0.  Usually terrible comedy's have at least one joke that is unironically funny, This does not.  Half of the Emoji movies runtime was product placement disguised as character development, there is no real character development in this movie, it seems as if there was real character development scenes but they cut those out because in scenes there is random information that the characters know that they shouldn't.
