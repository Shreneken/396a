  "critic_reviews": [
    "It tempers its fairly blunt narrative approach by constantly shifting its perspective. It starts off as the portrait of a troubled child, but expands to become a film about community.",
    "Wonder is that rare thing, a family picture that moves and amuses while never overtly pandering.",
    "An emotionally involving drama that deftly sidesteps mawkishness.",
    "Although the film takes place in a fantasy version of brownstone Brooklyn, it’s more cutting than the book, especially for the way it shuns the concept of a star vehicle and sharpens the material into a forum for several moments of guilt.",
    "Featuring several stunning performances by its stars, with Jacob Tremblay shining brightest of them all, Wonder ends up being a much better and wiser film than its trailers or premise let on.",
    "Wonder has an overflowing humanism that extends to less-sympathetic characters.",
    "It’s a very tasteful heart-tugger — a drama of disarmingly level-headed empathy that glides along with wit, assurance, and grace, and has something touching and resonant to say about the current climate of American bullying.",
    "Uniformly strong performances help ground the story. Tremblay, who showed instincts beyond his years in the devastating 2015 drama “Room,” provides both a sweetness and an intelligence to his 10-year-old character that make him accessible even when he’s wearing an astronaut helmet to hide his face.",
    "It has a wonderful message about tolerance, acceptance, understanding and respect. There's no guarantee the message would register with all moviegoers, but social ignorance can be cured one person at a time.",
    "What elevates Stephen Chbosky’s adaptation of the bestselling novel of the same name by R.J. Palacio is the myriad ways in which Wonder catches us just a little off-guard and puts lumps in our throats even when Auggie is off-screen, and we’re learning about supporting characters who rarely get their own sections in movies such as this.",
    "For the vast majority of its 113-minute running time, Wonder stays genuine and true.",
    "Wonder does occasionally suffer from kid-movie pitfalls, straining to be cute or mining humor from ridiculously precocious little ones. But mostly it succeeds in telling not one complicated story, but many, and giving the experience of being a confused or lonely or scared youngster the space it deserves.",
    "Much of the film’s success does reside upon Chbosky’s mostly restrained execution, but it is Tremblay that carries it. His fully rendered and exceptional performance is something of a miracle as it joyously goes past the prosthetics and into the core of his character’s roller coaster of emotions.",
    "Wonder is as manipulative as movies get, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes a story needs to steer you; sometimes a story tells you what to feel, but redeems itself by virtue of the sincerity with which it shows why you should feel that way.",
    "Wonder is a story of connection, not suffering. Dramatizing one boy's effect on the people around him, it invites the viewer into that fold.",
    "Kids may not notice or care, but the movie, which advocates kindness, comes with an irony. It’s a film about embracing differences and seeing beyond appearances, but it rarely bucks convention or gets more than skin deep.",
    "Giving the film credit where it’s due, Wonder never cheats in its pursuit of emotion. It’s never mawkish or manipulative, and its characters are so well-established both in the writing and in the performances that the movie ultimately does the hard work of earning those damp Kleenexes.",
    "The film features some of the most clichéd aphorisms about kindness and inner beauty this side of an inspirational wall hanging. But honestly? It could have been a lot worse.",
    "Wonder promotes the benefits of human decency in a time when those virtues feel limited, and wins you over by being a pretty good film about being good — and that’s good enough for it to work.",
    "Because Wonder wants to attract viewers of all ages and seeks to provide a “positive” experience, it glosses over the darker aspects that a story of this sort should address. In doing so, it at times feels dishonest and the Pollyanna-ish ending borders on cloying.",
    "Wonder is an emotional wipeout, that's for sure, but Chbosky handles it with such tenderness and delicacy, you won't hate yourself (too much) for giving in.",
    "Wonder, through depictions of the burdens shouldered by its characters, through jolting displays of childhood cruelty and heartfelt moments of compassion, earns that reach-for-the-handkerchief.",
    "A movie that succeeds as a tearjerker, if you can withstand those pushy moments (and there are a few) when it kind of makes you want to hate kindness.",
    "Much as there is right with Wonder, there’s just as much that isn’t. Emotionally, the movie rarely feels false.",
    "It sometimes over-plays its hand but, anchored by a terrific Jacob Tremblay, Wonder is a warm persuasive argument for tolerance. And it’s always great to have Julia Roberts back on the big screen.",
    "While the movie’s premise feels prone to the maudlin, it’s ultimately quite poignant; Wonder is a family-oriented tale in which people make mistakes in the way they treat one another, but learn and grow in a way that doesn’t feel condescending to the film’s younger audience.",
    "Though it keeps Auggie's fine sense of humor and his remarkably even-keeled attitude about himself and his situation, the movie version of Wonder feels more pat and After School Special-ish than the novel.",
    "Wonder will make you cry — that’s one of the main purposes of its existence — but it’ll also drive you a little crazy.",
    "Owen Wilson cries, but audiences will more likely roll their eyeballs at writer-director Stephen Chbosky's outrageous emotional manipulations.",
    "The film has an almost pathological need to ensure that everything turns out well for every single character, while at the same time eliding any truly difficult issues.",
    "The film is being marketed to kids and their parents, and as such, it’s well worth mom and dad’s hard-earned sawbuck for the implicit lessons it stresses. Be kind, especially to the seemingly strange ones who might not look like you.",
    "Because of the quality of the performances and the sincerity of the execution, Wonder doesn’t need to artificially stir our emotions, so it’s a shame that Chbosky lets the tone get away from him, badgering viewers with his points rather than simply letting the material speak for itself.",
    "It is a film with all the depth of a fridge magnet."

Not my cup of tea but Wonder is suitable for all ages and definitely worth your time.Jacob Tremblay stars as Auggie, a young boy entering mainstream school for the first time and with that comes the obvious problems. Bullying, making friends etc. It seemed like every scene was trying to outdo the previous, determined to push the viewer to their limit and overwhelm you with emotions. I understand the message the movie is getting across, tolerance, compassion but at times it felt a little much at driving home the point. Wonder practically writes itself, playing out exactly how you'd expect and contains little surprises but it tells the story in a unique way, taking the story of Auggie and looking at it from different perspectives which adds that extra depth that the story definitely needed. The world doesn't always revolve around Auggie and the character development for the rest of the cast was perfect. Tremblay is absolutely brilliant, surrounded by a great supporting cast and tied together with a story you can't help but get drawn into. A real crowd pleaser, recommended and don't forget the tissues.",

It is a story of many loves: between a mother and son, mother and daughter, father and son, father and daughter,“Wonder” might not win any awards, not even mentioned for any, but it is one of the most heartfelt, moving movies of the year. It is a story of many loves: between a mother and son, mother and daughter, father and son, father and daughter, brother and sister along with what it means to be different.In this case Auggie was born facial deformities and had to go through many operations to be able to talk, see, hear, among other things. His mother stepped off her path to home school him which was a must due to all the surgeries but decided at the age of 10 Auggie was ready, had to, join the real world and started him at middle school where most of the kids would also be facing a strange world.Kids can be cruel to each other, especially to those who are different, and Auggie is taunted, classmates being ugly towards him, afraid of touching him thinking he might be contagious, not being friendly to him but ostracizing him, making fun of his looks and generally bullying him. Due to his facial abnormalities he looks forward to Halloween so his face can be covered with the kids not knowing who he is and he can cat, be, one of them.Based on a best-selling young adult novel by R. J. Palacio and adapted for the screen by Stephen Chbosky, Steven Conrad and Jack Thorne “Wonder” it is a film for everyone who have had to deal with problems, people and just life in general. “Wonder” is about children and adults made for children and adults.Jacob Tremblay, as Auggie, had a breakout role in “The Room” and follows that up with a different acting challenge meeting it head on and makes Auggie a real child with all the problems a child faces learning, knowing his deformity is just another one. His older sister Via, played superbly by Izabela Vidovic, loves her brother but knows she had to be shunted aside by her parents while Auggie was in and out of hospitals. As he starts middle school she is just starting high school after her best friend, Danielle Rose Russell, returned from a summer away a different person than the one she was. She also meets Nadji Jeter who introduces her to the school theatre group.Of the other children all come across as children you knew when you went to school. There is Noah Jupe as Jack who befriends Auggie and unknowingly turns his back on him, Bryce Gheisar as Julian the lead bully with his own group of followers who make things worse for Auggie and when Julian is faced with his bullying his parents stand up for him.When it comes to the adults the principal, Mandy Patinkin and his homeroom teacher Daveed Diggs treat Auggie as just another kid while Ali Liebert, a science teacher, backs Auggie’s interest in science and his class project. Sonia Braga’s cameo as Via’s grandmother has an effective scene with her granddaughter.Jacob Tremblay is the star of the movie but Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson, as parents all kids wish they had, contribute not only as loving, supporting parents but parents who deal with the problems their younger son has to face. They are both warm, strong people yet you see the concern as she sends her boy off to school and the realization that both her children may soon be leaving their home. Wilson is the fun dad, the one who can make his kids live safe and who can act as childish as they do yet let them see how much he also loves their mother.Director Stephen Chbosky does an excellent job showing the home life, the school life and the social interactions, both negative and positive, between young people, moving smoothly bringing emotional times, looking at and answering hard questions, while showing the most important lessons both kids and adults need to learn.“Wonder” is a film parents can take their children to without embarrassment and both will be entertained, share recognizable moments from their own relationships with each other and others and during the 133 minutes of the film bringing the audience along for the ride and involve them emotionally.",

Reading the book was so severely frustrating for me because it was for the readers who relate to the people around Auggie. Auggie's behavior wasn't realistic and it felt undermining that a fictional 5th grader had more forgiveness and tolerance than I did at his age. The movie made it worse if anything. It's frustrating to me that this book and movie is so celebrated because every time I see it sitting on a shelf, I'm discouraged.",

I was a victim of incessant and relentless bullying as a junior high schooler through about the ninth grade by a bunch of cowardly rednecks who delighted in making miserable anybody who wasn't athletic and especially if they were from somewhere else (my family moved from a Midwest state to the South when I was 12) and were smarter.    While I fortunately didn't have the deformities that afflicts the hero of this picture, I nonetheless recall the horrible treatment I received without any justification, and lived in a virtual state of terror until high school when I grew up a lot, and one of the ringleaders moved.    The rest didn't have the brains to carry on his orders against me.    So, even today at 56 sometimes the memories haunt me.    So while I never reciprocated and bullied anybody younger or weaker than me, seeing that it would be just as bad as those who were harassing me, resentment and anger helped scar my life well into my early '20's.    This is important because \"Wonder\" does a good job of showing how terrible, mean and stupid our \"precious\" kids can be.    While the movie ends well, and is done thoughtfully with fine acting by all involved, it does give us an idea of what some of our kids suffer through, with or without a disability.    In one scene, one particularly mean little jerk is sent to the administrator's office for numerous verbal and other attacks against \"Auggie\", his parents are defensive, belligerent, and refuse to believe their little angel could be capable of the very acts he's committing.    And frankly, in the real world, victimized kids don't turn the school into admirers except maybe for a more compassionate and intelligent friend or two.    I don't recommend this movie for anybody being bullied, or who suffered at the hands of these cretins, boys or girls.    It may be just too painful to relive.    It touched a life long raw nerve with me, and while it's a fine movie, I do not want to see it again.    Society is full of adult bullies too -  bosses, co-worker idiots, stupid neighbors, control freaks, who can't handle anything that isn't their way, abusers of all sorts, etc.    I don't want to pay to see that behavior.",

It shows us how the way you look doesn't change who you are on the inside, that we shouldn't judge one another for the way they look or the way they dress or behave, that it's the heart deep down that matters. At least once I saw August face a problem whether it be bullying or trying to fit in, and thought \"Hey, I've had to deal with that once.\". The movie makes us remember the hardships we had to face through school and life as a kid. It makes you look at this young boy and understand the pain he feels, and feel sorry for him. When he's happy, you're happy. When he's sad, you're sad. When he's angry, your angry. The movie masterfully conveys our emotions, which is what drama movies should do.If you're wanting to treat your kids to a movie that gives them good morals, Wonder is your movie.",

How he makes a story for each character is incredible to me. You're going to be hating the antagonist and loving the protagonists. My favorite scene was when Jack Will punched Julian in the face because it left you feeling proud of Jack for standing up to his friend. And the twist where Jack talks bad about Auggie behind his back left you feeling betrayed just like Auggie, and the ending made you feel redemption and it was a real tear-jerker.",

In all honesty, I like every role that is presented in the movie, it makes me think the characters in the book must have been real fun.I would voraciously disagree with anyone who thinks that is same old spongy sorry sod like story that tries to wring out the tear ducts. In fact to avoid a situation like that, Auggie with problems while still being the center of the universe, the movie is divided off into pieces where his family and friends are given space to be explored. The aspects of school and student life - The overlooked elder sister, the estranged best friend, the jittery friend-to-be, the mother who sacrifices so much, the perfectly beautiful family with seen and unseen scars. It is so well done.There are no easy answers to some curve-balls life will always keep throwing us; but it is so much better to have people around us who care for our existence and are in a symbiotic emotional relationship that positively uplifts us. That is what this movie is all about - about memories, about love, about compassion, about family, about friends, about choices you make and the chances you take and perhaps a few more unsaid things I may have overlooked. I know not if I have convinced and helped you make up mind on what do about this movie, I were to end with here with one last suggestion - Don't judge things by appearances, at least try to be fair, and watch this movie. You'll know how you feel thereon.",

Personally, I cannot think of anything that addresses not just bullying but the bullying of someone that may look different than what people consider \"normal.\" It is great for this to finally be talked about in the open, and it shines light on something that also should be addressed more, which is bullying. It is awesome to see the perspectives of not just the main character, but everyone else in his life as well. Standing up to a bully is much easier said than done, but this movie shows the overcoming of fear to stand up for your friend at a tough age. The only thing that seems controversial to me is that the main character has a pretend face that was created by makeup artists. I almost wish a real person was used to show the real beauty of someone that defies the whole idea of what \"normal\" is.",

That’s what’s beautiful about this movie. Wonder is a story about a boy born with a facial deficiency who has been homeschooled all his life. His parents decide to enroll him in public school so he can attend the first year of middle school around other kids. However, at the public school he is teased and bullied to no end.

Emotionally persuasive with a touch of cliché? Yes. But, it’s warm, tender, and intelligently thoughtful too!  Movies and TV have become so cynical and ugly these days that it’s often all too easy to forget the importance of being reminded - just how essential human kindness remains.  R.J.Palacio’s perceptive novel has been transferred to the screen with professional production values - inviting us to look back and recall a gentler attitude and how important balanced human relationships are – especially to those less fortunate than most. It’s broken into segments that invite us to understand the motivations of many of its main characters and the complex intertwining relationships they have with each other – this is done cleverly and without feeling episodic.  Some may find it too saccharine (and at times it might be) but, it still made for a refreshing change and was good to be moved to tears by an encounter with human goodness instead of human trash.  This suffering world certainly needs more, and looking at the HUGE box office returns the suffering patrons agreed!Top performances from youngsters Jacob Tremblay (‘Room’ ’15) playing August (who, along with another child actor Jaeden Lieberher -‘The Conformation ’16) bring a professional innocence to their screen characters. Lovely Izabella Vidovic is marvellous as his patient but emotionally suffering sister. Most adult roles also add to this movies special appeal. Want to be reminded of how it could be? - this may just serve that purpose.",

I suppose it is perhaps a little predictable but I thought that it wasn't as tacky as it perhaps could have come across and also I thought that the main cast did pretty well in their respective roles, especially Jacob Tremblay as the main character, August aka Auggie and Julia Roberts as his mum.
