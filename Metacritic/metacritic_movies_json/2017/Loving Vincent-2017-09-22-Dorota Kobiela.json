The man was carrying nothing; his hands clasped to a fresh bullet wound leaking blood from his belly. This was Vincent van Gogh, then a little known artist; now the most famous artist in the world. His tragic death has long been known, what has remained a mystery is how and why he came to be shot. Loving Vincent tells that story.… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "It was a pleasure to become happily lost in this unique film’s world of color and line, and to see two filmmakers’ mad dream come true.",
    "An animated film like no other, Loving Vincent is a staggering visual achievement.",
    "A triumph of painstaking technical prowess and stunning visuals over storytelling and dialogue. See it for its nuanced take on a huge cultural figure and to applaud its astounding audacity.",
    "An engrossing exploration of the artist’s final days rendered in his signature painting style.",
    "Loving Vincent may exist as a showcase for its technique, but it’s the sensitivity the film shows toward its subject that ultimately distinguishes this particular oeuvre from the countless bad copies that already litter the world’s flea markets.",
    "The animation lifts Loving Vincent (he signed some of his letters with a hearty “handshake from your loving Vincent”) above the mystery, above mere biography, into something brilliant, revealing and unique.",
    "Visually, it’s spectacular. Conceptually, it’s jaw-dropping to simply considering the effort that went into this. The story, however, doesn’t always hold its own.",
    "Loving Vincent is gorgeous. It's a film of immersive beauty.",
    "Visually you can certainly call the film a breakthrough.",
    "Beyond explanation is the art itself. Animating Van Gogh’s bold impasto, already kinetic on the canvas, could have been merely superfluous. As moving pictures, though, the brushstrokes have an unexpected pull in this uneven but deeply felt homage.",
    "The painstaking work done by Kobiela and Welchman to turn some of the artist’s most prized canvases into animated scenes can be impressive to behold.",
    "The fact that this movie, with its 65,000 painted frames, was even attempted, is daunting. It’s the kind of folly that demands a measure of respect, for the effort, if not altogether for the result.",
    "There’s something ineffably beautiful about such a purehearted folly, even if a Herzogian drama about the making of Loving Vincent might have more to offer than the film does itself.",
    "The results are visually dazzling. The movie as a whole is something less.",
    "If you are hungry for dazzling eye candy and don’t mind a less-than-meaty narrative, this might please your palate.",
    "As the story limps and drags, the viewer also becomes accustomed to the images, and astonishment at the film’s innovative, painstaking technique begins to fade. But its charm never quite wears off, for reasons summed up in the title.",
    "As stimulating as it is, the animation ends up being more pictorial than expressive—an initially fancy but eventually rather monotonous way to dress up what is ultimately a mundane drag of a detective procedural.",
    "The film does have enough visual interest and occasional revelation to allow it to limp with dignity to its conclusion.",
    "As beautiful as Loving Vincent may appear, there is nothing behind the brushstrokes.",
    "Unfortunately, Spot the Painting is this wooden movie’s only sustaining thrill, because the investigation plot rarely generates any lasting interest.",
    "Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman's film is driven by an off-putting and oxymoronic fusion of reverence and egotism."

Every frame was hand painted beautifully by very skilful artists over a period of two years. I believe the entire film took about seven years in all to complete. The resulting animation looks like a moving work of art. The oil paints seem to glide effortlessly over the subject matter creating scene after scene. It truly is a feast for the eyes. The story elaborates on the events leading up to and after Van Gogh's untimely death. His demise is still shrouded in a great deal of mystery. Some say he killed himself while others are adamant that he was murdered but chose to protect the killer's identity in his dying moments. It's surprisingly engaging as a detective story and really adds to the whole experience. Wonderful work by everyone involved in creating this from the artists to the cast to the producers. Astounding, original and highly recommended viewing.",

However, after learning of Theo's death, he begins investigating the small town of Auvers where Vincent passed away, and learns that the circumstances surrounding Vincent's death are suspicious. Of course, the whole film is such a unique way of storytelling, probably the most unique I've ever seen, as it is ALL oil-painted, and it goes without saying the visuals are incredible. Each frame is beautifully drawn, and sewn together very well by good editing. The film's plot is told through flashbacks, as Rolan goes around Auvers asking many people questions about Vincent, and (thank God) the flashbacks are good. They don't bore you/disengage you from the story, and the change of colour scheme in the flashbacks draws your attention even more to the screen you're viewing them on.Also, there is a small subplot in the story that develops the character of Armand Rolan very nicely, and this plotline aids and abets the main detective/investigatory plotline, making the viewing all the more enjoyable. I think people won't like this film purely because of the animation style, because it does take a little bit of time to get used to (only a couple of minutes), but because it is so out there, I think it'll draw people away from watching it. Also, the change of accents from what they would've been might make some people disconnect from the film, because all accents are English, and if I'm honest I'm not sure they worked, and I think I'd have preferred the authentic accents.",

Utilizing the services of 100 artists the paintings of the great Van Gogh come to life in this, for want of a better word, animation of his subjects, landscapes, flowers and starry starry skies. However, and in addition to this  unorthodox film, it also  attempts to solve the mystery as to how this artist died. Van Gogh, who painted over 800 works of art in his short life (and sold only 1while he was alive) is an intriguing subject and the filmmakers waste no time or footage in exploring his complicated and troubled life. I give the film an 8.0 and urge all who have any appreciation of the work of Vincent Van Gogh and who are ready to allow themselves the pleasure of an extraordinary theatrical experience to see the film.",

Armand travels around Europe in search of relatives or closer people he could deliver his father's farewell letter to, but finds the mystery surrounding Gogh's death and the deceiving locals to be of higher priority. Douglas Booth is absolutely fantastic as Armand, whom I have never seen before but will love to see more from now on. From the second he appears on the screen all the way to the end of the film, he is a strong, charismatic and relatable presence that audience easily sympathizes with as he is young and arrogant, but reasonably so as he is far more interested at succeeding at his own life rather than go looking for answers for someone else's death, the peer pressure he feels from relatives can be understood by even the youngest members in the audience. The supporting cast is excellent as well, with Saoirse Ronan standing out as Madame Gachet, the wife of Doctor Gachet(played equally well by Jerome Flynn) who appears mean and mysterious from the first page of her carefully drawn canvas pictures. The whodunit plot is easy to follow, and the wealth of flashbacks and backstories provided by the colorful characters Armand comes across are emotionally punctual and enthralling, with complementary editing that keeps the pace brisk, yet adventurous, slow but deliberately so, that along with Clint Mansell's(Ghost in the Shell, Black Swan) is beautiful, haunting and compelling, he's certainly a composer to watch out for.The artwork, or rather the visual style I was referring to has been hand drawn by over 120 artists, painting over 60000 paintings on canvases, with the intended purpose to recreate both the style of Van Gogh's paintings and capture the visual appearance of the actors in a way that doesn't feel too realistic but not otherworldly either, somewhere in between would be the correct phrasing. The film is absolutely beautiful, the cinematography is excellent, as it draws on many of Gogh's famous works, translates them onto the screen, incorporates them into the narrative, in a way that makes his paintings quite literally come to life or gain new meaning, a new life. It's rare that a film with so much style and such simple premise manages to be so enhancing, I found the style of the film to be more than just good-looking, but also fitting and poignant, as the story gets darker and Gogh is made out by characters to NOT to be the angel we'd think he'd have been by simply looking at his work, the style of the film reminds us once again that there was beauty to his madness and his pain, adding all the more weight to the story as we're even more intrigued by what would've led a person this talented to draw himself an end so tragic. In an age where films are dominated by CGI, deterring audiences and pulling them out of the film's established reality, \"Loving Vincent\" does the complete opposite, it draws them further in and doesn't let go for the entirety of its runtime, furthermore it talks about life and influence and how people tend to look at the aspects of someone's life that may not be as important as the things they've left behind and the things that they could've left behind if said aspects of his/her life wouldn't have been caused by people who should've loved him.\"Loving Vincent\" is a powerful piece of cinema, with strong performances from a talented cast, each and every frame feels like it has a purpose, to excite, scare, enrich and educate people on the work of a master, and by being so successful at it, the films becomes something of a masterpiece of its own, one whose basic premise you start to overlook as you realize how much it has moved you, by utilizing all aspects of film making, by being genuinely creative and unique and very much so daring, just like the person it's based upon.",

You should watch this movie.  Why? Because it is sort of thing that in the first place makes people want to explore escapists panels of an artwork. It is the sort of thing that not only is bearer of a tale of reality that is embellished in places for the better but also the courageous sort and innovative workmanship that inspires people to do better. And if you think I am being overzealous in my praise of this movie, then let me remind of the hard work that was put into making 65000 frames of oil painting that were used to make this animated motion picture. It does not rest in its laurels aforementioned which surely are being already recorded in some or other panels of history, it produces passionate acting from a caring cast who fill and fit in well in their roles telling the tale of a man who lived with internal turmoil in life than the fame and recognition his art brought him in death.As far as arguments about his repetitive and not enough display of the titular character goes, I implore people to gather patience, be calm and revisit their words and possibly watching the movie itself. It is a posthumous journey of finding the truth of a perceived reality and while it does take time to get the bottom of things, it doesn't dally and neither do its protagonist seem bland. Also, while Van Gogh is shown infrequently, it is meaningful to his arc and every moments of this narrative is dedicated to him. To a Man who drew 800 pieces f art in 8 years, To a Man who was so troubled and so lonely, To a Man whose story changed the heart of another man unwilling and To a Man who left memories - for better or worse - in his wake for a lifetimes to come.If you still don't think this is worth your time, well good luck to further endeavors which I hope may bring you almost as much joy as this story did for me. And if you ever see anyone who was involved in this movie and its making, call them out and give them a congratulatory hug recognizing their contribution and dedications. Viva La Van Gogh!",

Loving Vincent is landmark event for animation and even biographical storytelling through its majestic vision at the last days of Vincent Van Gogh.Set a after the death of fabled painter, Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth) is possessed with a letter from Van Gogh to his brother Theo before his death, and begins the journey to deliver it. While on call, Roulin encounters all the people close to Vincent before is death gradually trying to put the pieces of what cause his sudden suicide. From this we are taken back to key moments of Van Gogh's life mesmerizingly displayed through the living oil paintings.Generated by 65,000 paintings by over a 100 artist, Loving Vincent is living work of art. First shot as a live action depiction then adapted into paintings, the immersive gallery of scenes is a first in new format of animation. Directors: Dorota Kobiela, and Hugh Welchman take Van Gogh's own artistry into his own biography (almost), from Citizen Kane style narrative, assessing and celebrating the life of one of the worlds if not the most famous painter. From this production becomes transporting cinema experience into the world of Van Gogh and an enchanting watch of magnificent painting and animation.Of course what is the fundamental strength of Loving Vincent is its captivating artwork which for every moment is spectacular, and then you have the real narrative of Van Gogh's last days which on its own is an affectionate journey. Even if you don't not much about the life of Van Gogh this is an enthralling experience.The monumental presence of the paintings is consistently exceptional with wonderful detail and creation put into it. One of the sensational efforts for the film is its sketch of the real actors, making them instantly recognisable on screen, bringing their performance into the art. Although our eyes are set on visual presence, Clint Mansell's score is also a tear-jerking atmosphere throughout the film, capturing the melancholy as well as joy of Van Gogh.Loving Vincent is a visual sensation, proving the amazing talent that animation brings to the screen. This is by far one of the most significant films of the year and is must see experience, especially for art students.",

But what is trulyHere stands a film perhaps as oddly remarkable as the great artist whose demise it documents; Loving Vincent is a Polish-UK co-production charting the final days (and the shady aftermath of which) of Vincent Van Gogh. But what is truly extraordinary about this film is that it is the first animated film created entirely with oil paints, in the notable style of its eponymous painter. Loving Vincent is an ambitious visual experiment, every frame avowedly hand-painted in a pastiche of Van Gogh’s work. It’s an experiment that certainly works; landscapes swirl dreamily across the screens and oozing strokes of paint litter the faces of the film’s players. There is something strangely ethereal about the animation; it’s utterly immersive and beautiful and surely can be appreciated simply for its flair and the pain-staking commitment required to create it. The film was also shot in live-action beforehand; we see Chris O’Dowd, Saoirse Ronan and the rest of the cast embodied within the brushstrokes, in a strangely satisfying and delightfully expressive way. There’s an effortlessness and innovation to the film’s design; the same cannot be said, however, of its plot.Though not unenjoyable, Loving Vincent’s plot is rather thin, comprised of exposition-packed flashbacks and uninspired dialogue. Over-narrated and over-simplified, it never really takes flight or makes much of an impact, despite numerous attempts. We watch as young Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth) seeks to deliver a letter, at the request of his father, from a deceased Vincent to his brother, only to become hooked in finding out the truth behind the artist’s death among the witnesses of his final days. The cast, led by Booth, are lively enough, but are not enough to distract one from a flimsy narrative that begins to feel like a tame episode of Poirot. Despite this, the film is entertaining enough and it’s clear that the true intentions of directors Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman is to impress via the film’s visuals rather than its story.Loving Vincent is a definite mixed bag of a film; visually, it’s exquisite and never excessively dull, but its formulaic and uninspired plot cannot be ignored. For a movie that claims to be a biopic of Vincent Van Gogh, it tells us very little about the man itself, functioning far more as a standard who-dunnit that is gorgeous to watch but, on occasion, feels self-admiring. An interesting film that is worth watching just for its pure style.",

The weak point of this movie is basically everything except the beautiful and unbelievable animation.The Good:-Without a doubt, the best of this movie is the animation. Every single frame is incredible, it's a love letter to Vincent Van Gogh as the visual style is based on Van Gogh's paintings and some scenes of the movie are direct references to some of his most iconic works of art. I'm impressed of the effort from all of the animators to make this movie a moving painting.I would actually watch this movie again just to admire the animation.-I think the acting was solid for the most part.The Bad:-The script and story. This is basically some sort of \"crime investigation\" film, as the focus of the movie is the investigation of the true causes of Van Gogh's death. That's obviously not the problem, the problem is that it's a very repetitive movie. There's one scene of someone talking to another person, then that person talks about something he knew about Van Gogh in a flashback, and then that someone walks and talks to another person, that other person talks about Van Gogh in a flashback again and so on. By the fourth time this happened I was like \"Oh, not again\". And that's the major problem.-Because of the repetitive story structure, there's no character development and it results in an overall forgettable movie.I would obviously recommend this movie if you're interested in animation or you're an animation student as this is just an amazing movie visually speaking. But if you're not interested in animated movies...Well, I think I can't really recommend it.I give it a 7/10 because the animation gives it tons of extra points, if this was a standard live action movie, then I would've give it a red score.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThere is absolutely no doubt of it: the visuals are extraordinary thanks to all these artists who have been working on this movie for several years. And I speak about visuals in general because this is a short way to mean that lighting is wonderful, details are omnipresent, movements are gorgeous and colours are meaningful. Those artists have successfully recreated some of the major Van Gogh's paintings and managed to have them included impressively in the movie.Despite these points 'Loving Vincent' also could have been way different and maybe so much better than what it actually is. Only speaking about the scenario, all this project does is to add flashbacks to flashbacks to try to solve a passed potential crime. Why does this have to be so close to the investigation and crime category of movies? This totally ruins the thing! You could have made it so much more biographical, closer to Van Gogh's daily life. All we hear about him comes from people speaking about him: 'I heard this...', 'I saw that...', ... And the movie underlines the fact that everyone has a different opinion about Van Gogh and the events of his death.The end especially could have been so much better. The last thing we see and hear is the opinion of Dr. Gachet, the main doctor of Van Gogh. And the movie ends in a certain way that we want to believe this last testimony. However it is just another opinion and we had a lot of them during the feauture. So for me this is totally an open ending that tries to erase a lot of what we saw before. The conclusion is so easy: 'he killed himself in a weird way because he was totally crazy'. And after all we have been through it is such a lame conclusion! A few inconsistencies in the movie doesn't match at all with this end.So I want the end of this review to be far more mixed than the movie end. I think as I said that this movie is incredible by the way it has been produced and the way it looks. But I found that the stroytelling appears to be really poor to me. A lot of characters are badly introduced or unintelligible (as the simple dummy boy at the end). Not bad but could have easily been better.",

I found the various characters intriguing and I found it a very watchable film. I believe it took many years to make, due to the traditional paint based animation and it shows. I felt like I could see the emotion in the various characters eyes, with hints of teardrops appearing in the corners of their eyes and the like.I am quite a big fan of animation, have always been since a child, so this film had appealed to me for a long time and I honestly can't say it disappointed. I was both interested to see it in terms of the painting work used to create it but also in terms of being interested in the story of the troubled person who was Vincent Van Gogh and this film certainly taught me more about him. I was aware of his time spent in Arles, in France, having visited the area a few summers ago and this place features in the film, so I found it very interesting, with good voice work from the cast, including Josh Burdett, Holly Earl, John Sessions, Helen McCrory and Chris O'Dowd.Even if your not especially keen on Van Gogh, I would still recommend it as a different type of film from 'regular' CGI based animation or the like. However, I should probably point out that this is rated 12 in the UK due to the theme of mental illness being inevitably present but also there was a scene depicting a prostitute with a customer and the infamous gifting of Vincents cut ear is also depicted, so I wouldn't recommend it be shown to pre-teens certainly.",

The film is beautifully animated and tells us a story that is excellent and the soundtrack is nice here. The only downside is that the film is in 4: 3 format, which I understand on the one hand, because it would be more difficult to animate to a larger size, but it's still a shame.",
