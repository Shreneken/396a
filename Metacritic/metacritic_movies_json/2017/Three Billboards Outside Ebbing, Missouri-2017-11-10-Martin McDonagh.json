When his second-in-command Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell), an immature mother\u2019s boy with a penchant for violence, gets involved, the battle between Mildred and Ebbing's law enforcement is only exacerbated.\u2026 Expand",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Funny, brutal and breathtakingly beautiful. Two exceptionally raw lead performances, supercharged by a bold script from Martin McDonagh, could make Three Billboards this year\u2019s Awards-upsetter.",
        "McDormand is an unstoppable force in a fiercely intelligent, profanely poetic movie that shifts tonal gears at breakneck speed.",
        "Traverses a high wire between comedy and tragedy and does so without a safety net. Outside the Coen Brothers, it\u2019s hard to find a filmmaker with that skill and with this production, McDonagh has placed himself in august company.",
        "Entertaining in a way that\u2019s practically unheard of these days. It\u2019s about the sheer exhilaration of expressing yourself, no matter what anybody thinks.",
        "A meticulously shot and sharply written character study, it plays like a blend of the Coen brothers and Quentin Tarantino, borrowing its subtle philosophical core from the former and its sudden bursts of violence and blood-spattering vitriol from the latter. It's also a great film, an entertaining and thoughtful examination of one woman's journey into darkness, as well as a study of the corrosive nature of anger and hate when left unchecked.",
        "Three Billboards lands somewhere near Coen brothers country, eloquently finding comedy in horror and vice versa. Yet it remains its own mangy animal; a study in grief that\u2019s funny, finding justice in terror and forgiveness after the unforgivable.",
        "Following the path of \u201cThree Billboards\u201d is a little like driving down an unfamiliar road in beautiful but forbidding country late at night, and alternately marveling at the scenery and gripping the steering wheel tightly when yet another steep drop or sudden change of direction presents itself.",
        "It\u2019s one of the best pictures of the year.",
        "The movie represents a leap forward for writer-director Martin McDonagh. Three Billboards is as clever and imaginative as McDonagh\u2019s \u201cIn Bruges,\u201d in terms of how it makes characters collide in delightful and unexpected ways.",
        "It's a renegade masterpiece that will get you good.",
        "Writer/director Martin McDonagh (In Bruges) crafts an expertly structured, brutal, yet surprisingly rousing narrative around a woman who\u2019s ready to torch her entire life if it means catching a killer.",
        "Anger is an energy in Martin McDonagh\u2019s brilliant Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, one of the best films of the year.",
        "It is a movie about how anger consumes and destroys, and how the only cure for that anger is empathy, something that\u2019s in short supply these days but Three Billboards has in abundance.",
        "McDonagh\u2019s latest work is simply exceptional; a film so rich with narrative fluidity, profane laughs, standout performances and complex character studies that its tremendous emotional hits\u2013often arriving when you least expect them\u2013might just leave you agog.",
        "It all makes for soaringly satisfying viewing, yet the satisfaction comes from blistering performances and virtuosic screenwriting, and absolutely nothing else.",
        "Those familiar with McDonagh\u2019s work will be unsurprised to learn that Three Billboards is a bold and showboating affair, robustly drawn and richly written; a violent carnival of small-town American life. Yet it has a big, beating heart, even a rough-edged compassion for its brawling inhabitants.",
        "It is a film that continually complicates and recomplicates itself, denying viewers the comfort of easy moral footing. It is by turns heartbreaking, harrowing in its violence, and very, very funny, and it features Oscar-level performances by Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, and Sam Rockwell.",
        "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is Martin McDonagh\u2019s most emotional and profound film to date.",
        "Three Billboards may be a film chiefly concerned with rage, and pain, but it\u2019s also one of the best dark comedies of recent vintage, and one of the better dramas as well. While some of McDonagh\u2019s narrative threads do time out in unexpected and even unresolved ways, the film\u2019s highs are exemplary.",
        "Not only is Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri the director\u2019s most accomplished film yet, it\u2019s also his most compassionate.",
        "What immediately comes to the forefront is that McDonagh has choreographed an almost impossible feat of a brutally dark comedy that, thanks to both Rockwell and McDormand, elicits an emotional response you simply don\u2019t see coming.",
        "\"Three Billboards\" is a really good movie filled with terrific performances, but what McDormand is doing here surpasses them all.",
        "In the hands of uncommon writer-director Martin McDonagh and a splendid cast toplined by Frances McDormand in what could be the role of her rich and varied career, the how and why of those billboards becomes a savage film, even a dangerous one, the blackest take-no-prisoners farce in quite some time.",
        "The movie is, by turns \u2014 and sometimes simultaneously \u2014 darkly comic, blazingly profane, flat-out hilarious and shockingly violent, not to mention flippant, tender, poetic and profound.",
        "In the end, it's all about McDormand, who\u2019s great at playing ordinary women in extraordinary circumstances.",
        "While the film continues almost throughout to generate great whoops of shocking laughter, it's the notes of genuine sorrow, compassion and contrition that resonate.",
        "It\u2019s a remarkable performance by McDormand, matched by Rockwell.",
        "McDormand, carrying the movie on blue-denimed shoulders, is a wonder. Every now and then, she lets us see the tiniest crack in Mildred\u2019s anger, through which something flickering shines through.",
        "The script is pungent and profanely funny while remaining rooted in strong and serious emotions.",
        "On shifting ground, it is McDormand's fine performance that holds steady here, her wit and her fury eliciting more admiration than pity for the unrelenting Mildred. McDonagh does not always conquer this heartland, but McDormand already owns it.",
        "This rural drama is the best yet from playwright and filmmaker Martin McDonagh (\u201cIn Bruges,\u201d \u201cSeven Psychopaths\u201d), and one of Frances McDormand\u2019s greatest performances.",
        "The film is the finest balance yet of Martin McDonagh's bleak sense of humor and offbeat moral sincerity.",
        "Landing closer to Coens country, Three Billboards is more of a slow-roasting tragicomedy about grief and culpability, with higher stakes, a lower gag count, and emphasis on the tragic. But McDonagh still lives for detours and digressions, for the opportunity to stall the plot and humorously slow play a conversation.",
        "This is a film that\u2019s proudly impertinent but also deeply morally serious. And even if Three Billboards doesn\u2019t always hold together, that\u2019s appropriate for its anxious characters who are, themselves, a little unsteady.",
        "Though Mildred makes many choices that are reprehensible or downright dangerous, McDormand never fails to convince us of the fundamental decency of this woman, a tragic heroine struggling to find even the tiniest scrap of meaning in a comically awful world.",
        "Not since \"Fargo\" (1996) has [McDormand] found a character of such fibre. She doesn't pitch it to us, still less try to make it palatable; she seems to state Mildred, presenting her as a given fact, like someone unrolling a map.",
        "I confess that I had a hard time reconciling McDonagh\u2019s madcap incongruities with the horror of the original crime and the grief of a mother struggling to cope with so primal an injury. Are the people who love the movie less rigid in their tastes? Or has McDonagh succeeded in so thoroughly psyching them out that they\u2019re afraid to call foul?",
        "Every performance in this movie acknowledges that while tragedy is what prompted the film\u2019s events, its contours, characters, and conversations are pure, inky black comedy. Absurdity makes for good humor, and the screwed-up world in which these characters live is nothing if not absurd.",
        "It\u2019s far from a masterpiece, yet it holds you, it adds up, and it\u2019s something to see.",
        "It\u2019s full of sharp dialogue and entertaining characters and fuelled by a wryly enlightened view of our world and how it can be at once cruel and caring. For a story built on such dark foundations, it\u2019s weirdly reassuring. It\u2019s also enormous fun.",
        "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a multi-layered piece with such swathes of great dialogue that it will no doubt reward - if not demand - multiple viewings. It's also another item of evidence pointing toward a filmmaker getting into his stride.",
        "However commanding and absorbing Three Billboards may be, the film is diminished by its neatness and unconvincing resolutions to the many dilemmas it puts into play.",
        "For a while it\u2019s engaging but pretty thin. Then it gets more interesting, especially for the actors.",
        "His (Martin McDonagh) movie fuses naturalism and hysterically pitched theatricality with sometimes uneasy, but bracing results.",
        "A tar-black comedy so caustic it nearly burns a hole in the screen, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri banks a lot on the gale force of Frances McDormand, and nearly pulls it off.",
        "Everything fits together too neatly in \u201cThree Billboards,\u201d even when chaos descends, but the performers add enough rough texture so that it doesn\u2019t always feel so worked.",
        "Anchored by a funny, foul-mouthed performance from McDormand, McDonagh\u2019s daringly-structured dark comedy is rich and layered and often laugh-out-loud funny but trips over constant tonal shifts.",
        "McDormand is a bit too spartan and sealed off in the role. Her steeliness doesn\u2019t have enough emotional levels.",
        "A mixed bag of dumb jokes and unspeakable violence that is a big improvement over his (McDonagh) other work (it towers over Seven Psychopaths, which was one of the worst movies ever made) but not good enough to write home about at today\u2019s inflated postal rates.",
        "McDormand could have carried this film all the way through a minefield of touchy topics, singed but with all parts in the right place, primed for a painful laugh. But goddamnit if the cops in this story didn\u2019t ruin all the fun."

A few days later he is hanging out in bars. Full of incongruent moments. Peter Dinklage as a gimmick character who is totally pointless to the plot or movie.

One particularly lazy moment is a speech that essentially tries to establish the Hollywood stance on the Catholic religion.  The town priest was only a prop in a scene so that Frances McDormand could deliver a speech which, although poignant and funny, was so obviously premeditated and could never have been delivered in the surprise of the moment.Beyond this moment and a few other cringe-worthy statements, the movie is very well done.

It tells theThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a film directed by Martin McDonagh known for other great films like Seven Psychopaths and In Brudges. The film came out on 2016 and has been regarded as a cult classic ever since. It tells the story of Mildred, a mother of two whose daughter had been murdered and raped; as there is a lack of interest from the local police on the murder of her daughter she decides to take justice in her own hands and push the police to restart the investigation in the form of three billboards with messages against the chief of the town. Little does she know that everything will go off the rails from there\u2026.The movie on itself is a pretty worthwhile experience, there is plenty of good acting, specially from the main leads played by Frances McDormand (in probably her best performance to date) and Sam Rockwell. Their characters, despite having differences on their perception of justice, manage to deliver a solid and believable hate relationship that evolves in such a natural scheme that you find yourself astonished on how almost perfectly everything plays out for them at the end of the film. There is always a feeling of unpredictability to it, you never know where the story is going to go, you could certainly say that most of the movie is composed of plot-twists but it is mind-blowing to know that they don't feel forced at any moment as the story progresses with a pretty light pace without feeling over-stuffed during its whole runtime.The technical aspects are breathtaking, McDonagh proves to be a masterful director once again with a familiar story that takes a bizarre approach to its subject matter. There is plenty to enjoy from masterful directing to a beautiful soundtrack composed of country and classic music that turn Three Billboards into a remarkable craft. Motherhood, vengeance, redemption and regret are only a handful of the themes touched in Three Billboards. The emotional parts hit you hard most of the time because everything about it feels so authentic, it is an amazing work of passion. Conclusion: Three Billboards is probably the best movie to come out on 2017 and its impact will remain as one of the most heartbreaking black comedies of the decade, the conflict feels real and the characters, the heart of the film, make it worth a watch.",

Its too on the nose, and really not particularly interesting giving that they won't even be characters (they do little to nothing). They are \"token black guy\", only they aren't a black guy. If you don't have those characters in the script, why bother to do this fake inclusion stuff? But still. Great.",

Frances McDormand was wonderful as always, as was the supporting cast, with the likes of Woody Harrelson and the highly underrated Sam Rockwell in what I'd consider his best performance yet. The film and its story felt like all too familiar territory to me at times, and the ending was a bit anticlimactic for my liking, but it still had plenty of funny and memorable moments to at least keep it worthwhile for the most part. Overall, it's not amazing like what I've been hearing about it, but it contains solid work from its reliable cast and an interesting story that keeps it entertaining and amusing enough throughout. It's also worth noting that fans of director Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) will likely find much to enjoy and admire about the dark humor in this that he's become so well known for.",

I just thought it was funny. Sure, the presentation was a bit more gritty than in your average comedy, but I felt it was still a film made for laughs.As with all the best comedies, the plot was as basic as it gets. But who needs a plot when you\u2019ve got laughs. And there were plenty of twists and turns too. Things happened that even the savviest audience member wouldn\u2019t have seen coming. Some of these unexpected moments demonstrated a braveness on the part of the film makers \u2013 writing out a major character halfway through the film.Of the three main leads (Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, and Sam Rockwell) it\u2019s hard to say who takes the crown for best performance. McDormand\u2019s character was an instant audience favourite, but I felt Rockwell owned the film. His portray of a confused thug seeing the error of his ways and becoming the remorseful anti-hero, undercut the witty dialogue and gave the film a real reason for being.It\u2019s always good to go into a film being slightly weary of the hype, and then almost instantly understanding what all the fuss was about. Time and possible awards (though the latter is not a measure of something\u2019s worth) will see the greatness of Three Billboards only increase. Bravo to all concerned.",

Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri has the perfect balance of character driven movie and script driven movie and addition to this, an unpredictable one. Martin McDonagh; the writer-director, brings out something new in this genre that has never been witnessed, he plays with his characters and tracks like he is juggling and even his short characters too will make you feel for them (Peter Dinklage and Caleb Landry Jones) which shows the range of the characters and the actors. Frances McDormand oozes power like never before; she is brutal, arrogant, sometimes wrong and surprisingly funny. Woody Harrelson is straight out stunning in it but the real trump card is Sam Rockwell; he almost has a parallel role to Frances and he justifies his presence till the last frame.

The representation of women in this film is definitely contrary to stereotypes- Mildred is a **** lady and \u2018Momma\u2019 Dixon is anything but a doting mother. The film seemed to seamlessly switch between drama, comedy, dark comedy. Dixon, the emasculated, simple, racist policeman is the perfect respite from what could have been a wholly dark (and dull) storyline. You can tell a lot of thought has gone into this film- the choices of music e.g. 'The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down' playing while Dixon listens in to the potential rapist and murderer of Angela.One of my favourite scenes is of Dixon reading Willoughby's letter in the police station, while Mildred is firing molotov cocktails at him from the opposite building. The scene is so surreal and absurd, and good and bad seem to no longer be useful categorisations. The characters are trapped in a cycle of efforts to change things, which backfire and prove futile.I found it sort of cute how in Willoughby's letter to his wife he says 'I know they were cheating' about his daughters; even in his state of mind, his humour remains. Willoughby's character is really amiable- even when Mildred shows no compassion when he tells her he has cancer, he can take her perspective, and even pays for the billboards for the next month. Mildred's confrontation with the pastor is half expected but the confidence and certitude with which she speaks (as well as her arguments) was a pleasure to watch. However Mildred hasn't considered the cost to her son, of this ferocious search for the truth behind her daughter's rape and murder. The characters\u2019 actions bring about the opposite of what they intend, and attempts to right wrongs are doomed to failure. The humour twists into irony.I think what makes this film so special is how the very dark subject matter of a teenage girl's rape and murder (Mildred's daughter) brings to the fore the dysfunction lying within almost all the characters, and underlying the situation.  Nothing is sugar-coated: I found it realistic how Charlie (Mildred\u2019s ex) is at one moment about to choke her to death, and then calm resumes when the two parents empathise with one another over the loss of Angela.  The audience can see how these two people at some point in life were compatible- both being witty if anything. The characters are tangled in a set-up which is impossible to escape.  No matter what they say or what they do, they cannot make a difference: They remain the toys of fate.",

The way it shows how tenuous is the line between what you hate and you can become is amazing, the ambiguity that the character have is an exemplification of all of us, of how difficult is to keep ourselves whole in a world that surprise us every minute.The acting and the script combined is what make this movie what it is, every character have his moment and a moment that show that every action results in a reaction, each people can react in a way and have different perspectives ate situations.Frances Macdormand plays a complex character, a broke person, sensitive for what she been through in her recent life, all the problems, the feel of guilt and unrighteousness that surround her. At the same time she is tough and rough, passing a strong image, from belief and from someone that would do anything for what she think is right, not letting anyone do sh*t to her.. Even that, this make she looks kind of who she hates in some moments.Woody Harrelson also does a phenomenal job, his character can make people be on his side or against him, isn't a unilateral movie, you can understand his side or you can think that he is lazy. His character have a impact that affect, causing a react in a lot of characters in the movie, each one having a different reaction and possibly changing the attitudes.Sam Rockwell have a great whole and a great character development, his character is possibly the one that have the best twist, his interpretation is great making you believe in what's going on with the character.The soundtrack ins beautiful, putting you at the moment, and doing a great job in letting you down or excited with what is going on.Everyday we are about to do a bunch of choices, one day we can do good and in the other no that much, just like the characters we are all ambiguous.This is a rough movie, that gonna make you think some good stuff, a must much definely.",

What really gives the story it's power is how well we are able to connect with her character. On top of being so well-written, McDormand's performance is what makes \"Mildred Hayes\" so believable and sympathetic. That best actress award was completely deserved.To me the movie was really about anger. We see the effects of it's festering and learn that the only way to get past some of it is to show empathy and actively try to move on. Although Three Billboards leaves it up in the air as to whether or not it is something we will ever be able to truly escape. Almost every character here is tragically flawed in some way. While McDormand is most certainly in the lead, the problems the rest of the characters are experiencing provide for a more compelling and morally complex dilemma the people of Ebbing find themselves in. McDonagh has no problem diving right into the dangers of human ignorance and hatefulness. Something that gives the film it's powerful and poignant dramatic edge.Speaking of writer/director McDonagh, you can really feel his background as a playwright running through every aspect of Three Billboards. Sometimes there were scenes that I could truly see unfolding directly before me in a live performance onstage. It was as if I was almost experiencing the different acts unfolding as if in a performance theatre. This being a film though, the action unfolds in such a way that makes it feel more like real life as opposed to the more obvious simulation of one we get when we watch plays.Not everything is gloom, doom, and all around seriousness in this movie. One thing that really surprised was how outright hilarious it can be. Mildred Hayes' sharp tongue and Sam Worthington's performance as a dimwitted cop allow for plenty of laughs. Their back-and-forth rivalry provides the comedic backbone of the film. It's a surprisingly naughty little movie at that as well. Vulgar and violent in ways that come across as a little kid having fun trying out his first dirty words. McDonagh proves unafraid to get with some of that more politically-incorrect humor. But rather that just indulging in it for the sake of doing so, he uses it as a way to show just how ignorant small southern towns can be. This is coming from somebody who has lived in a few.You know, I don't think Caleb Landry Jones gets enough credit for his performance in this movie. He was actually my favorite side-character in here and despite having something of a smaller role his appearance was one of the more memorable aspects for me. But anyways, watch this movie. It's really fantastic and has a way of tickling your funny bone, punching you in the gut, and grabbing your heart all in a little under two hours. It deals with stuff that is very real and McDormand's performance needs to be seen.",

This week, Martin McDonagh\u2019s tragedy of theWith the Oscars around the corner, it\u2019s a race against the clock as all the Best Picture contenders make their way to the silver screens worldwide in order to be exhibited in front of an audience. This week, Martin McDonagh\u2019s tragedy of the human condition Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri made its way to the Lebanese box office.A minimalist plot that follows Mildred Hayes, played by Frances McDormand, as she makes a bold move, painting three signs leading into her town, the film\u2019s namesake, with a controversial message directed at William Willoughby, played by Woody Harrelson, the town's revered chief of police. Things only get worse, when Willoughby\u2019s second-in-command Officer Dixon, palyed by Sam Rockwell, an immature mother\u2019s boy with a taste for violence, gets involved.Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri is an allegory to what happens when human beings are pushed too far.Starting with Mildred Hayes, who is dealing with her daughter\u2019s unsolved murder, the town of Ebbing\u2019s non-dis, a French term meaning the things we bury deep within ourselves, begin to boil over and get exposed.The film\u2019s power comes from its masterful screenplay and multifaceted characters.Written by McDonagh, the narrative explores what happens when rage can\u2019t be calmed. As the tension mounts, the film delves into themes of division, anger and moral reckoning.All of these ideologies and Mildred\u2019s emotional quest are contrasted with the film\u2019s dark comedy, a hefty challenge to any writer\u2026but this is why the film is so memorable.The overall tone of the film fits into an almost Greco-tragedy structure, where the characters simply fall victim to their ever-growing hatred.The dialogue is both stylistic, almost Shakespearean at times, all the while being grounded and realistic, which brings a certain rawness to the narrative and the actors\u2019 performances. It\u2019s not a tale of smoke and mirrors or holier than thou attitude, on the contrary \u2013 the film is the uncensored, flawed, ugly, yet somehow hopeful truth.Yes, the film has garnered some attention due to it taking on the subject of a young girl who was raped and murdered and how that affected the town she was from, while balancing racism, and bigotry \u2013 but the film is about way more than that.Visually, the film transforms the fictional town of Ebbing into a town so vivid it is almost real.Cinematographer Ben Davis gives the town a very claustrophobic yet charming feel, ensuring that camera movement and frames that are minimal yet emotionally striking. In a strikingly beautiful scene between Mildred and a deer, all elements merge together in a heartbreaking symphony of sound and image.This is the epitome of what Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missori is all about.This is not a film about the technicalities, nor about the spectacle of cinema \u2013 it is a film about human nature, about characters, about society, life\u2019s hardships, and how people reel with anguish over loss, unfairness and the resistance to change.Featuring some of the most powerful performances of 2017, Three Billboards brings together an Oscar-worthy ensemble that deserves every bit of praise they are receiving.Francis McDormand takes on an almost John Wayne-esque role as the grieving mother without regret who decides to take on and test the very fabric of Ebbing, Missouri. \u201cShe is more in the tradition of the Spaghetti Western\u2019s mystery man, who comes walking down the center of the street, guns drawn, and blows everybody away,\u201d said McDormand when talking about how she took on the role of Mildred.It\u2019s rare when films of this nature come around and when they do they grant the audience with a cathartic experience that challenge the viewer and leads to potential discourse about hate, intolerance, and the true meaning of humanity.",

Mildred Hayes is a hard, sassy talking, take no bull from anyone, headstrong woman who doesn\u2019t give an inch and gets laughs just by the way she delivers a zinger.  Her daughter had been raped, killed and burned alive 7 months before and the case seems to be cold and she won\u2019t stand for it.She rents 3 billboards on a very seldom driven road stating 1) RAPED WHILE DYING 2) AND STILL NO ARRESTS and 3) HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY? Along with everything else Mildred has the guilt of the last words saying to her daughter, \u201cI Hope you do get raped!\u201d in anger and frustration with her. As horrible as that sounds you are on her side no matter what she does and says and you never know what that will be!As good as McDormand is, and she is good, Woody Harrelson, as Chief Willoughby, matches her anger, frustration with the absence of leads and not being able to help the woman though they are alike in many ways. He has problems of his own to face and there is a 2-3 minute scene between him and his wife Anne, played by Abbie Cornish, showing what love is all about. He also, obviously, loves his 2 daughters.Giving Harrelson and McDormand a run for best performance in this movie is saying a lot and Sam Rockwell as a dim-witted, racist, violent police officer does just that. Caleb Landry Jones as the advertiser who rents the billboards to Mildred is fierce though seems to be a bit too young for the role. John Hawks, as Mildred\u2019s wife beating ex-husband Charlie and his new 19 year old girlfriend Samara Weaving are just two of the townspeople against her and the billboards. Lucas Hedges, as the son of Mildred and Charlie, definitely his mother\u2019s son, Clarke Peters is a new police chief while Peter Dinklage is a car dealer who gives Mildred an alibi when she needs one and Sandy Martin as Rockwell\u2019s mother all add to the movie.This is a deep movie in spite of the foul language and the many laughs from situations, but it has many dark moments, a lot of violence, resolved and unresolved relationships and though all the characters are frayed in one way or another you come to care for them because of the screenplay and direction by Martin McDonagh.\u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u201d, aside from its cumbersome title, will be mentioned in many categories during award time and is a must see.",

You can feel her pain and hate, but also see a softer side to her character which makes you have sympathy for Mildred.Sam Rockwell, on the other hand, gives one of his finest performance of the film. The character Dixon is short-tempered and not very bright. What stops him from being unlikeable is Rockwell charm and honesty. Dixon has a tremendous arc of learning to care about others rather then just being angry.Caleb Landry Jones, John Hawkes, Woody Harrelson, and Peter Dinklage were all superb. All of them having brilliant moments in whatever screen time they have. Not Lucas Hedges, I thought he was awful in this.Martin McDonagh just keeps hitting the home runs through out his career. The script was the real show stealer here. The dialogue is so rich and masterful, it keeps you locked from start till finish. Cinematography, editing, and music are all top of the range.What else can I say, I loved it every second of it.",

This is a well written and directed film by noted playwright Martin McDonagh as he guides the audience through the many complexities faced by each character in the story. This film, despite its 2 hour length, left this writer with disappointment that it ended and this is in no small part due to the perfect blending of fine acting, writing and directing resulting in a positive theatrical experience.

Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a masterpiece, brilliant from start to finish. A truly dark story twisted together with black comedy and an outstanding cast. Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell are particularly impressive. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh, there is a reason everyone is talking about this film and it's definitely not one to be missed.You don\u2019t need me to set the story up, the trailer did that just fine, Mildred's daughter has been murdered and months later the police have nothing to show for it so in an attempt to get some movement on the case and throw it back into the spotlight she rents three billboards with a powerful message to the police. It\u2019s easy to tell when you\u2019re watching a terrific film and from the beginning Three Billboards grips you and doesn\u2019t let go once. Who doesn't love a bit of dark humour? Martin McDonagh has found the balance between comedy and tragedy, such a morbid topic handled to perfection. A movie that cares about its characters, keeps the story unpredictable and honestly what more do I need to say to convince you? McDormand is exceptional, perfectly capturing the pure rage of a grieving mother. Sam Rockwell has the best character development I've seen in a film this year, giving an Oscar worthy performance. I cannot recommend this highly enough, I loved every minute of it, I'm dying to see it again and I urge you all to see it, no exceptions.",

They make films that are quirky and yet somehow believable.  This film has moments that are so over the top they would never happen in real life.  For example, there is a scene where a teenager at a school throws a soda on the Frances McDormand character's car, and the way she handles it would never happen in real life, and there were no consequences for her actions.  In fact, she does several outrageous things without any consequences.  There are other unbelievable outrageous moments that I won't go into.  Other times the quirkiness works, so it's a mixed bag for me.  This movie is definitely not a visitor's guide for the state of Missouri as most of the town are portrayed as bigots, including the police force.  The acting was stellar throughout.

With fantastic acting all around from our three main leads, with high praise for Sam Rockwell and Francis McDormand, and solid directing from Martin McDonagh, Three Billboards is a stark look at justice and how uneasy and often brutal it is, especially when it comes with wanting justice for heinous crimes. People have been up at arms with how the movie wants to \"sympathizes with racist cops\" when they are missing the point.

The film has performed exceptionally well so far this awardsFollowing my viewing of the Golden Globes, and more recently, the SAG awards, I decided that watching Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri would most likely be a good idea. The film has performed exceptionally well so far this awards season, consistently winning many of the awards it was put up for. After being fortunate enough to see it, I can understand why.I feel it is worth quickly adding that, while watching this film, I was quite tired. I\u2019d seen Coco earlier that same day, and I rarely go out for that long a period. The fact that the film still made such an impact on me in that state is impressive.Ordinarily, this isn\u2019t the sort of film I\u2019d be attracted to. I didn\u2019t really recognise many of the actors going in, nor was it based on an existing property. To put it bluntly, it was a proper, standalone film. After seeing it, I was genuinely impressed.Ordinarily, I would list highlights of a film, then delve into the issues. Now, however, I\u2019m perplexed; the film did everything well, at least to an extent. There was only a few things I found issue with. The CGI (which was used incredibly sparingly) was often rather jarring. It didn\u2019t fit with the rest of the gorgeously shot world. Though the locations are never astounding, Ben Davis makes even relatively mundane countryside look beautiful.The characters shown within this film are rather fascinating. The events leading up to the film could almost be a film in themselves. Despite what reading a synopsis may imply, however, this film isn\u2019t a murder mystery. The murder of Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand)\u2019s daughter isn\u2019t the focal point of the film. Instead, the main focus of the film is how the event impacts various people, and how they go on to deal with it. Each main character is rather layered, and could arguably be the lead in their own film.Bringing these characters to life is a brilliantly talented cast. Frances McDormand deserves each award she receives. I feel the trailer actually does her character a disservice; after watching it, I felt that she was simply a vulgar, hateful woman taking her frustrations out on those around her. In reality, she\u2019s a far more sympathetic character, who isn\u2019t nearly as abrasive as the trailer makes her out to be. Woody Harrelson\u2019s Chief Willoughby was probably my favourite character of the film, who, despite playing the straight man in many scenes, is able to bring levity and humour to the dark situations in which he finds himself. Sam Rockwell\u2019s Dixon is also wonderful, though many people have taken issue with his character\u2019s arc. Personally, I enjoyed it greatly, though it\u2019s something to note.Many of the supporting characters are hit or miss. I feel Peter Dinklage was brilliantly funny, though some of the others failed to steal a chuckle from me. The rest of the audience seemed to enjoy them, however, so it\u2019s most likely a fault of my own.I was pleasantly surprised by how violent this film is; the trailer makes it seem that violence is a punchline to a joke, but at times, the movie is genuinely brutal. It\u2019s probably more violent than most modern horror films.The soundtrack was actually rather enjoyable. The original scoring was great, and fit the setting perfectly. The other songs added each served their purpose, oftentimes accentuating the comedy within a scene.For the most part, I found the writing great. The characters spoke like real (if dramatised) people, though occasionally there was some odd lines.To conclude the review, I feel this was a truly impressive film, and I understand why it\u2019s getting so many nominations. If you love film, I must recommend you give this one a watch. Thankfully, this isn\u2019t one you need to see in the cinema; I think it could work just as well on a smaller screen. If you need a concrete ending, however, you may need to steer clear; it\u2019s rather open ended. I feel Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri deserves a 9/10, and I look forward to seeing more films of a similar quality to this one.",

The empathy you can have for the characters is up to both the actors and the director.  This movie pulls you emotional in so many directions, that you do not know whether to cry or laugh, get pissed off or clap your hands.

They have grown so much as actors over the years from comedic roles to this shows me their range and talent.  I also have to give major props to Writer/ Director Martin McDonagh who gave life to this film by giving us some levity in between the tragic elements of the story.  There is some serious deep stuff thrown at the movie goer, but letting us smile and laugh at such characters as Momma Dixon, (Sandy Martin), Frances's ex-husband, (John Hawke) and his young innocent girlfriend, (Samara Weaving) was the cornerstone of what makes this movie great.  Even the subplots of Peter Dinklage's character, Kerry Condon who plays the sheriff's wife, and Abbie Cornish' marketing/ad guy let us feel so much in their scenes is a mark of truly brilliant storytelling. The director really made his actors' performances come to life, and as a movie goer, I am glad I choose to see it.In closing, I do not give movies a 10 score.  This is as close to a 10 as I will recognize.  There is always room for improvement, so to give it a perfect score means that perfection was achieved.

Only the open ended and unresolved nature of the ending threw me for a major curve, and could've perhaps been handled differently .  But perhaps that's the point---that many problems in life are never ever resolved.  And, I love the complex portrayal of law enforcement and how Rockwell's character changes due to circumstances over time---since I don't really believe that all of law enforcement are dullards, but complex people with much intelligence and families to care for.

Many unexpected twists that I didn't see coming kept the story intriguing the entire time.  Movie should do very well at the Oscars as its by far the best acted movie I've seen this year.",

Martin Mcdonagh is a great director that actually did a perfect movie where all fits. The final is controversial but not entirely bad, very opened but that give us a tiny climax to the characters. Plot twists are GREAT.",

How come,After months without a culprit in her daughter's murder case, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) rents out three billboards (that are located outside Ebbing, Missouri) and puts up the message \u201cRaped while dying and still no arrests? How come, Chief Willoughby?\u201d This causes mass outrage from an entire town of colourful characters who adore chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) including a \u201cfat dentist\u201d, a \u201clady with the funny eye\u201d and Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell) a man who recently built a reputation for himself after beating up a black suspect. Or as Mildred colourfully puts it, Dixon has recently entered \u201cthe n***er torturing business\u201d. Is she in the right to put up the billboards? Is she helping draw attention on her daughter's murder case? Or is she just a rude woman who should stop fighting people she shouldn\u2019t consider her enemies? Who knows, but she\u2019s doing it anyway. And in a strange way when I watched her stand up against everyone in the entire town I was reminded a little of Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird. Just like Atticus she knows she\u2019s fighting a losing battle and that no matter what she does she will never be able to bring her daughter back. She also knows that it\u2019s unlikely that her daughter's killer will ever be found. But none of that matters because this is just something that she believes is the right thing to do. McDonagh\u2019s previous films (Seven Psychopaths and In Bruges) have always been strong at balancing dark humour with thought provoking drama. But unlike his other work, the comedy for the most part is much more nuanced, with more subtle performances and a stronger focus on character development. Though it does still have his distinct language which constantly strives to challenge Goodfellas and South Park for the most swear words per minute of screen time. Plus he\u2019s assembled an incredible ensemble cast, all of whom know just how to deliver McDonaghs dialogue and are all memorable in their own way.But the two standouts in the cast are definitely McDormand and Rockwell. It\u2019s kind of surprising seeing McDormand play a role whose personality is so polar opposite to Margo in Fargo. Whenever she\u2019s on screen she\u2019s such a dominating figure and has a brashness to say whatever she wants, no matter how reckless it is or how much harm it causes. She\u2019s also brilliant at delivering McDonagh\u2019s language. At the end of it I was pretty sure that I\u2019d enjoy watching an entire film of McDormand just going around town and swearing at people (which to be fair is kind of what I saw). This film might also be Rockwell\u2019s greatest performance yet. He\u2019s the image of the cop that Americans fear to see. The kind who thinks that his badge is an excuse to do whatever he wants and not have to face any consequences for it. He does so many hateful and despicable things in the film, but somehow Rockwell never lets you lose all hope for him. You always feel like he\u2019s going to do the right thing in the end, even if he\u2019s going to do a lot of wrong things first. At times hilarious, at others sorrowful and constantly thought provoking, Three Billboards is easily McDonagh\u2019s greatest work. It\u2019s a film that has a certain level of humanity and moral ambiguity that will continue to resonate long after you\u2019ve watched it.",

True, her performance is very similar to the one she gave in Olive Kitteridge in 2014, but it is outstanding nonetheless. I get that some people might feel cheated at the end, but this has got to be one of the best movies of the year.",
