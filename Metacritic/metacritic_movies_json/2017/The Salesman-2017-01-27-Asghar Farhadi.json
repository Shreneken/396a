  "rating": 7.5,

  "summary": "After their old flat becomes damaged, Emad (Shahab Hosseini) and Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti), a young couple living in Tehran, are forced to move into a new apartment. Eventually, an incident linked to the previous tenant of their new home dramatically changes the couple’s life.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The film offers insights into Iranian society while also subtly making a case that human foibles are universal.",
    "As often happens in films about putting on plays, life imitates art, but in this instance obliquely.",
    "With The Salesman, Farhadi opens a window into his own society that offers a universal view of the emotional rivalries within the human heart. Neither America nor Iran could ask any more of an artist.",
    "With exquisite patience and attention to detail, Asghar Farhadi, the writer and director, builds a solid and suspenseful plot out of ordinary incidents, and packs it with rich and resonant ideas.",
    "By the film’s shattering end, you’ll feel the spirit of Arthur Miller, one of the great dramatists of the 20th century, reaching across the transom to touch one of the great dramatists of the 21st.",
    "His new film, in Persian with English subtitles, is of a piece with his best work — tightly focused, rather than broad-gauge brilliant, and another instance of this superb filmmaker turning elusive motivations and the mysteries of personality into gripping drama.",
    "Asghar Farhadi's film yields a tonal and emotional friction that's simultaneously tragic, transcendent, and comic.",
    "For a healthy stretch, The Salesman is even more low-key, minimal, and contained than the earlier Farhadi films. Yet the writer-director’s technique is just as assured as before. Every shot is in place, every line leading to an outcome that feels quietly up for grabs.",
    "The performances are remarkable. So is the way Farhadi tells the story.",
    "All I can is that I didn’t draw too many breaths during the last half hour.",
    "The world of The Salesman isn’t quite as intricately imagined as some of its predecessors, and the story’s sleuthing element, while absorbing, often feels more narratively expedient than germane. But if the setup is creaky, the payoff, when it arrives, is a thing to behold.",
    "Rana’s voice comes roaring back in the film’s held-breath third act, in which these amateur actors return to their old apartment to enact a drama with life-or-death stakes. This final 30 minutes are the film’s pièce de résistance.",
    "The acting is wonderful throughout, but Alidoosti creates an especially haunting depiction of one woman's adversities in a country, and a marriage, that may not have her best interests at heart.",
    "If the conceit feels obvious and strained, it still gives Farhadi and his actors ample room to explore the ambiguities of commitment, ethics and revenge in a society where mistrust in public servants runs deep.",
    "Some descriptions of The Salesman call it a thriller, suggesting a Hollywood-style suspense film. It’s not. It’s a psychological and moral drama.",
    "A dazzling, darkly funny, quietly devastating human drama from the Islamic Republic of Iran.",
    "Farhadi’s new film, The Salesman, isn’t his best, or even second best, but it offers up glints of what, at times, makes him one of the best directors around.",
    "\"Death Of A Salesman\" does indeed figure into the story, as the film’s main characters, a married couple, are playing Willy and Linda Loman in an amateur production. On the whole, however, this starkly confrontational melodrama has more in common with the Charles Bronson classic \"Death Wish,\" even if it’s angry words rather than bullets that go whizzing across the screen.",
    "Though it is dense in allusion and rich in texture, there are choices he makes that ultimately pull The Salesman back from the greatness, and the engulfing universality of his best work. It is as compelling as anything Farhadi has ever made, but it’s also somehow smaller.",
    "Sparse and intricate, it’s a study of judgement, of ‘honour’, of Emad’s own fragile masculinity; one paralleled cleverly by his role in a production of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman.",
    "The two storylines interweave seamlessly and subtly, the couple's real-life problems not so much repeating as refracting the experiences of their fictional counterparts.",
    "What follows, in the final half hour of the movie, is an astounding chamber piece, worthy of Strindberg, with the husband, the wife, and her aggressor stuck in a dance of doubt and death. With every shot, our sympathies flicker and tilt.",
    "Though a vengeance riff, it remains a Farhadi film all through, so dancing around each other means a lot of talking about action instead of doing action. And that’s fine – the former playwright is uncommonly gifted in writing third acts, where each line of dialogue and simple gesture are imbued with meaning.",
    "This is a rich and complex take on guilt and anger.",
    "Lacking the astounding social complexity of his Academy Award winning drama A Separation, here the gears are not so hidden and a sense of contrived drama leads to some tedious sections. But all is forgiven when the final punches are delivered in a knock-out finale that leaves the viewer tense and breathless.",
    "Farhadi remains a master of pace and tension, slowly upping the stakes in an unsettling narrative fuelled by a lingering sense of powerlessness, paranoia and the possibility that you never entirely know the person you love.",
    "The Salesman makes for a gripping  drama of a relationship in crisis.",
    "The Salesman doesn’t have the same precision and emotional wallop of his previous films: The plot hinges on a couple of convenient contrivances, and the first half meanders a bit.",
    "Both Hosseini and Alidoosti underplay their parts with an apparent naturalism. And, yet, Farhadi constantly reminds the audience that they are watching a movie, that these handsome folks are actors playing actors in a film.",
    "Like his Oscar-winning “A Separation,” Iranian director Asghar Farhadi’s latest, nominated for this year’s Best Foreign Language Film, is an expertly crafted domestic thriller.",
    "Given that The Salesman strives to be far more than a revenge thriller, Emad’s story isn’t enough to make it an unqualified triumph, but it’s still a genuinely good film, and worth watching.",
    "Uncharacteristically inert, the film plods its way to a strained finale that erodes much of the strength of its potentially compelling themes.",
    "As drama, The Salesman wanders, meanders and searches, mostly pleasurably, until it hits an over-engineered final chapter.",
    "Watching The Salesman, I can’t help but feel that this is the first time Farhadi’s mastery of the particular is undercut by the artificiality with which he’s treated the general. He remains one of the world’s foremost filmmakers, but this time around, his expertise and artistry are undone by phoniness.",
    "On this present occasion, Farhadi may hardly be reinventing himself, but his old tools serve him just fine.",
    "The Salesman is a well-crafted, valuable drama."

We need to keep in mind that Farhadi had to use Aesopian language to let his film pass Iranian censorship. There are many episodes in this movie that are meaningful and symbolic but they are too ambiguous to know what exactly did Farhadi mean.For instance, when a window glass is cracking, does it mean a family in distress or a society falling apart?It could be either, or both.The movie seemed a bit too long for me, and I did not like that it was shot by hand-held camera. But obviously, Farhadi is a master of filmmaking. I do not think this movie is his best but I will see it again, and maybe more than once.",

When they return home from their production of \"Death of a Salesman,\" an unfortunate incident launches the drama with grief and suspicion. In American hands, this would be a high-pitched angry drama, but in the apprehensive culture of Iran and the underplayed style of the director, it's rendered as a more sober experience. There's virtually no music. The pacing is deliberate. Tension rises slightly during the compelling final encounter, but it remains emotionally subdued. This film provides interesting cultural insights and subtle performances, but the meandering pace requires patience.",

This is a film worthy of such an honor as its stars, Shabab Hoosini and Taraneh Alidoosti, portray a married couple involved in live theater as they perform the play within the play, i.e. “Death of a Salesman” ( hence the film’s title). In most cases dialogue in a foreign language with English titles can be a significant obstacle for an audience to properly enjoy a film’s value and worth but such is not the case here. The well written script, the delicate and sensitive directing and the superb acting make this a suspenseful, intense and important viewing experience. I give the film an 8.0 rating for, as any salesman will tell you, a quality product sells itself.",

They have to move to another apartment because their apartment is going to collapse. This moving cause a serious issue in their life because of the old tenant.In the beginning of the film when Emad_ with brilliant performance by Shahab Hosseini_ and his students was reading saedi’s play Cow, one of his student asked him “Sir,How does a man become cow?” Emad answered: “gradually”. This question and Emad’s answer are the main theme of this movie.Farhadi has used some part of the play Death of a Salesman in his movie masterfully and he has chosen Emad for the Willy’s role in order to show and emphasize how Emad gradually got far away from his family or even his wife just like willy.The last twenty minutes of film are really breathtaking and the spectators associate with Emad more than anytime and I think they regularly ask themselves “if I were him, what would I do?”The salesman is a story about revenge or with accurate express is a story about the motivation of revenge.This story like another fahadi’s movies occurs in a family and effects family members.After A separation and now with the salesman Farhadi can be considered as a great master in directing suspenseful family drama like Hitchcock.The salesman (Asghar Fahadi)(2016)By Hossein Aghaee",

The other notable idea is a well-illustrated three-dimensional interior space of buildings in both opening and ending sequence of the movie which has a lot to say about how each character is related to the other and to the social life as some sort of a “big other”.The script of the movie is highly engineered which makes somehow annoying and unbelievable; the set of items left behind by the intruder is just one of them. This all could be neglected if we could pursue the movie but the #1 thing on the “cons” column of this movie is lack of characterization  of the woman (Ra’na) which lives us with our pre-existing judgments about the human emotions and society to help us sympathizing with her, or have any meaningful relation with her situation what so ever; and this makes “the salesman” a mediocre film.",

Why? I don’t know, except maybe to give the film a title, as it doesn’t seem to have anything to do with the film or what takes place. Yes I can give a farfetched explanation regarding the famous line from the play, “Attention must be paid” but that is farfetched!The film opens with the couple having to move because their building may collapse and sets up for the assault that takes place and brings in a character, Babak Karimi, an actor who works with the husband and wife in the play who may or may not be the assaulter. Also the assault may or may not have included rape.There were a total of 5 seconds that aroused my interest in the film; the first being where, because of Iranian culture where the movie takes place, a character in the play is suppose to be in a revealing negligee the actress is fully dressed and the second is when someone is slapped unexpectedly.“The Salesman” runs a little over 2 hours and you can find better things to do with those 2+ hours.",

It is a French-Iranian co-production, but selected and won the Academy Awards for Iran. From the well know filmmaker of that region whose film had already won the same award in the not so past. I'm not just addicted to Hollywood. I'm a film fanatic because I give equal preference to films of the whole world. So I have seen as many as this year's submission for the Oscars in the category of the Foreign Language Films. And there are lots better films than this, that even did not make into the final five. From my perspective, this is an okay film, even comparing with the rest of the fellow nominees, including that I thought that would win, 'Under Sandet'. The mess is all because of Trump effect, as same reason 'Moonlight' to win the main trophy.At least it was not an average film like 'A Separation', though not a masterpiece like 'The Past' that did not even nominated for the Oscars. It stands between them. The title name is not exactly relevant to the story. But it helped to extend the plot for an extra 20-30 minutes. An unnecessary subplot, which really were the boring parts. Or you can say, just to attract the western audience with their ingredient and that worked out as planned for the filmmakers. Except those theatre portions, the rest of the film and its storyline looked like I was watching a French thriller.It is about a young couple who are forced to relocate to another house after their apartment building was declared not safe anymore for some kind of construction taking place in the nieghbourhood which is affecting it. The man is managing his job at a school as a teacher and the remaining time as a theatre artist along with his wife. The life was as usual, till one day something bad happens to his wife at home in his absence. Now he's raged to find the culprit, but once if he did what happens and how the story ends was the another twist.❝It's obvious you're not the one who found your wife the other day, otherwise you wouldn't say that.❞It was a very slow start. I mean the opening scene was like racy. And then following, it slowed to build the momentum. That does not mean the characters were developed so well. It only moves forward with constructing what are all needed for later parts. Once it enters the third act, the scenario changes. It looked like another film, another genre. Too tense moment and tight plot for the grand finale. Yep, that is the part makes this film to forget everything you saw in the earlier.Whatever happened in that part, I felt it was right, though I think culturally it differs the outcome. I mean, that's not philosophically the Iran we know or the religion they worship. You can say the western films badly portrayed them in their films, but if you look at their history, the film ending was shocking. So I thought, the end chaos was for among themselves. If the outsiders (westerners) were involved, it would have been a differently dealt.Very good performances. But not perfectly written screenplay as I pointed out a few things in the earlier paragraphs. And another thing was, the character, particularly the mysterious one, I was not satisfied how it had been developed. He enters the frame only at the last moment. The narration was very suspense and a bit thriller, but then all the sudden everything comes crumbling down since the end was very near to cease the procession. My point is, how that X man was netted does not make sense in reality. Being a film, it has no problem at all.So, it was a good film, but not as good as it was praised or won the Oscars. Yeah, definitely worth a watch. The setting was very good, except the ending, as the opinion differs from people to people and the amount of damage on how to deal with such situation. Overall, a little good message at the end, but not exactly a moral message as it brings more destruction towards the GOOD over the BAD which always win with a strong sentimental grip, no matter whoever involved in it.6.5/10",

The logic is messed up. You forgive your own wife's raper! Unfortunately, these directors are only showing the negatives of Iran, and hell yes, they are magnifying the issue 1000x! Normal Main Street Iranians have never experienced such stuff. And foreigners (to Iran) give prizes to these movies just because of that; showing the bad side of Iran.",

It seems Awards are now given out to sell a trendy moviemaker or a ‘product’. ‘Salesman’ is a vague, dreary movie in every sense – now this can be a good component if used to its full value but, this work is centred around an incident that happens in a very scant time – so scant, that all the elements that make up the largest percentage of the overlong story are left wanting, as in, hardly believable or full of obviously undeveloped character motivation and situations. Seems this is all award-winning works now need...a grim situation, overblown to look stronger than the writing actually sets up. Add to this a background reference to a literary classic (“Death of a Salesman”) to suggest this work must also be intelligent by association but, that ‘association’ can equally be seen as a highly questionable metaphor. The situations that make up the sum of this movies scenario are somewhat pretentious and far from worthy of such high praise (as many other worldwide viewers have clearly noted) Performances are routinely good but the material is just too thin to last the dismal distance. If you’re inclined to think Awards must automatically represent high quality you may be satisfied – conversely, if you see awards as 40% quality and 60% promotion you might join others among the disappointed.",

I felt both very sorry for the wife and frustrated by the attitude displayed by the husband. It was interesting seeing such a foreign culture/community tackle a western play (The Salesman by Arthur Miller), though not too many scenes show the play itself I suppose - certainly not from the audience's perspective. I thought it had good plot development, with the pace speeding up towards the end. All in all, it's a somewhat sobering and thought-provoking watch, which I'd recommend to fans of world cinema.",
