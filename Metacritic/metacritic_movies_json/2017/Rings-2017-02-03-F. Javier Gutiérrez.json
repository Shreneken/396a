    "critic_reviews": [
        "This offshoot is essentially a well-produced, easily accessed B-movie. Still, it wouldn\u2019t kill you to watch it, and it does more than expected to reinvent its particular wheel.",
        "As a threequel, Rings suffers a bit from franchise fatigue. It tries to fix that by giving viewers an even deeper look at the mythology of Samara and the videotape, with mixed results.",
        "This film doesn\u2019t find any fresh ways to make you jump out of your seat. Ms. Lutz is appealing, though, and fans of the franchise will probably be pleased with the elaboration. Too many horror sequels are content merely to recycle what worked the first time.",
        "Rings doesn\u2019t end up doing much with its fresh ideas. Instead, it transforms into a kind of remake of a remake, borrowing not just the washed-out look of Verbinski\u2019s movie\u2014lots of blue hues and overcast skies\u2014but also its basic plot structure, which was itself lifted from the Japanese original.",
        "This mess isn\u2019t likely to reboot or revive the American franchise.",
        "Rings finds a couple of nice, if inconsequential, little chills.",
        "Pretty much everything about Rings is incoherent. And the most incoherent thing of all is the film\u2019s arrival a decade and a half after Verbinski\u2019s original remake (if such a term even makes sense).",
        "None of the cast brings anything like genuine terror or urgency to the proceedings. Only Vincent D\u2019Onofrio, making a third act appearance, acquits himself with honor.",
        "Rings is an unfortunate and often incomprehensible mess that kicks off with a neat premise and then never fully explores it.",
        "No matter how hard anyone tries to save her, this soggy nightmare just keeps on creeping out of the TV like it\u2019s her job. It\u2019d be even better if everyone just let her be evil.",
        "It just feels desperate.",
        "Categorizing Rings as \"horror\" would be a disservice to genre films, because at least the lowest of the low attempt a scare here or there.",
        "At no point does the movie manage even a single sequence of sustained tension, or a frisson of genuine terror.",
        "Rings is a phenomenally distracted film, and it can\u2019t focus on any one concept for too long.",
        "More wearying than frightening, Rings is a total non-starter.",
        "Rings is too beholden with current trends to truly exploit the potential it displays in its early going.",
        "Horror films that backstory the audience to death lose all hope of mining what\u2019s eerie and unsettling about the unknown, and Rings is a perfect example: it doesn\u2019t so much spread its familiar myth as dilute it.",
        "Rings is unsure as to whether it\u2019s a sequel to the other entries in the series or a contemporary reboot.",
        "Imagine simultaneously eating wallpaper paste, listening to Coldplay and watching the entire \u2018Da Vinci Code\u2019 trilogy back to back and you\u2019ll have some idea how grindingly tedious the experience of watching Rings becomes.",
        "Filmmaker F. Javier Guti\u00e9rrez really doesn't have a lot to work with beyond a flimsy story, weak script and characters you'll have a hard time caring about.",
        "The movie, which will be lucky to eke out a weekend\u2019s worth of business, isn\u2019t scary, it isn\u2019t awesome, and it doesn\u2019t nudge you to think of technology in a new way. But it does make you wish that you could rewind those two hours, or maybe just erase them.",
        "Rings never solidifies into one of kind movie, cramming a handful of possibilities into its bloated running time.",
        "If crap movies carried penalties for inflicting torture on audiences, then Rings would merit a death sentence."

Unfortunately the main couple that were clearly late 20-somethings cast at college freshmen weren't quite as inspiring.I thought the movie felt more like a psychological mystery with a darker twist than an actual horror film. Meaning I was never really scared while watching the film, for a part of the movie even Samara could be considered on the good team which makes it hard to be scared in that scenario. The film felt more like a reboot than a sequel as well. There were a few plot points I found intriguing, mostly I liked the ending, some might call it cliche but I didn't see it coming and it had the right feeling of how a horror movie should end imo.Overall I would say the movie was decent. I don't think it lived up to the reputation the first movie has and by no means am I saying everyone should go out and see it but I certainly don't think it deserves the 1/10 and 2/10 reviews it seems to be getting. It was a serviceable film and wasn't any worse than most of the horror movies that have came out recently. I think a 6/10 or 7/10 is a fair score.",

The actors did a good job but could not make up for the plot which was clearly an attempt to out do the versions before it... in a bad way. You will notice this forced complexity to the story. You will find yourself more infatuated in mystery, than in actual horror itself. There are no moments that feel real. This film had much more to work with yet provided a slightly below average experience compared to the horrors it should have been competing with. First you watch it. Then you probably won't again. However, I will not be one of the idiots to give this movie a red score. It was still fun to watch, the concept is close enough to the original, and you have not seen a bad horror movie if this is the worst it can get for you. Worth the watch for the average horror fan if you have nothing else better to do on a weekend.",

The Ring was one of my favorite horror films growing up as a child. It\u2019s one that I can still watch today and love. The trailer for the reboot looked good, maybe not like the best movie I would see, but good enough that I was excited enough about it to watch it the day it came out.Upon entering the movie,  I was pleased to see that quite a few other people shared my excitement, but also really upset that there were so many teenagers in the movie. I despise watching horror films with kids. They are always so loud. I sat with my popcorn and soda and waited anxiously for the movie to start, but I realized pretty soon that the previews were the best part of this film.The opening sequence on the plane showed such promise for the rest of the movie. It opens with a plane full of people, and of course one of them has seen the dreaded VHS film. Zach Roerig is the unlucky contestant on the plane, and he tells his worries to a fellow passenger. When he says that today would be the 7th day, you can see the dread on his face. Then, his nose starts bleeding. Chaos erupts on the plane after wards as the film starts showing on all of the mini seat TV\u2019s on the plane. Basically, Samara is there to take our beloved Matt back to Mystic Falls where he belongs (If you don\u2019t get the reference, I\u2019m sorry, The Vampire Diaries is where Roerig belongs, not here).Quite honestly, that\u2019s the best part of the movie to me. The rest is your typical bad horror movie. The premise for this reboot is a college professor buys a VHS player and sees the film. He learns if you make a copy and make someone else watch, your life is spared. He sees this as an opening to the \u201cother side\u201d. He\u2019s dating on of his students, played by Aimee Teegarden, who I was honestly excited to see in another project, but disappointed with her performance, and she helps him choose \u201capprentices\u201d from his class to watch the movie and then copy and make someone else watch. Basically, he is creating a never ending chain of doom. One of the students chosen is Holt, boyfriend of our protagonist, Julia. When Julia can\u2019t get ahold of Holt for several days, she packs her bags and heads to his college, and gets caught up in the middle of all the drama.Holt hasn\u2019t found anyone to watch his copy of the movie, and Julia wants to save him, so she watches the film herself. Honestly, I would have grabbed literally anyone and made them watch, but true love at it\u2019s finest, right? Sure. When Julia tries to copy her film, it seems there are new images in the movie, and hers cannot be copied. So, she has to figure out the mystery behind Samara and save her life.I\u2019ll admit, it had potential. But it fell flat on its face. It used elements of its 2002 predecessor, but didn\u2019t execute them in a manner that could stand next to the original. Everyone hated The Ring 2, and even it is better than this one was. The whole film was boring, slow, and the acting was sub-par.  There was a little bit of a twist in the story near the end, but it completely went off course of how I thought the movie should have went. I didn\u2019t like the creepy professor using his students as pawns in a life-or-death game story. I didn\u2019t like the twist. Samara didn\u2019t scare me. I didn\u2019t get the creepy feeling I got from watching the 2002 version of this film. Overall, I just didn\u2019t like this movie. It wasn\u2019t the worst horror remake I\u2019ve ever seen, but it is by far not anywhere near the best. I\u2019m disappointed I paid $12 to see this, and I wish I would have waited.In my personal opinion, I recommend waiting to see this film when it\u2019s released on DVD or Redbox. Instead, pop some popcorn at home and put in The Ring , it will be a much better time, I promise.",
