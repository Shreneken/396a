  "critic_reviews": [
    "Director Nora Twomey’s film is about the ways we try to cradle each other from the harsher realities of life. This is a day-to-day survival story that stirs the heart and fires the imagination.",
    "A work of striking beauty and affecting emotional heft enhanced by an Afghan-themed score by Mychael Danna & Jeff Danna, The Breadwinner reminds us yet again that the best of animation takes us anywhere at any time and makes us believe.",
    "Not unlike her gutsy protagonist, Twomey moves through the charged landscape with extraordinary agility. Combining gripping suspense with a quote from the immortal Persian poet Rumi, she creates a stirring final sequence from the rising chords of terror and resilience.",
    "Twomey gives The Breadwinner ballast, binding it to the real-world history that serves as its basis, and elevates it to realms of imagination at the same time. It’s a collision of truth and fantasy.",
    "In its alternating of Parvana’s day-to-day struggle with the tale she tells herself, the movie doesn’t promote bromides about stories and storytelling transcending reality. Rather, it demonstrates that the way imagination refracts reality can provide not only solace but also real-world strategy.",
    "The picture sings and inspires.",
    "So urgent and far-reaching that it never settles into the comforts of a coming-of-age story, The Breadwinner is a small film about the biggest things. It’s engaging from start to finish, but Twomey — to her great credit — prioritizes stoicism over sentimentality.",
    "Adapted by Anita Doron from the award-winning novel by Deborah Ellis, The Breadwinner delivers a heart-wrenching coming-of-age tale within a nation that’s lost its way.",
    "A rare animated film without a shred of sentimentality but bucket-loads of heart and soul. “Stories remain in our hearts all our lives,” Parvana’s father tells her. The Breadwinner is testament to that.",
    "Delighting in the ancient tradition of storytelling as a means of education and understanding as well as entertainment, Nora Twomey's The Breadwinner is a richly animated jewel.",
    "At times the film shows itself an outsiders-looking-in take on the culture it depicts.",
    "The film is honest enough not to exaggerate the beneficial results of Parvana’s courageous act.",
    "An ambitious but occasionally uneven animated film.",
    "For all its heart and beauty, The Breadwinner sputters a bit to a close. Its themes are undeniable — one walks away feeling angry and empowered. But with the story’s soft focus, one soon forgets why.",
    "It’s notable that since her hair is cut short and she’s wearing male clothes, none of the men suspect that she’s not a boy despite her chosen male name being only slightly less conspicuous than “McLovin.” Being evil is not the same thing as being intelligent or observant.",
    "Twomey’s mastery of colour and exquisite blend of traditional Afghan-inspired imagery with cel animation techniques is not matched by such a confident command of tone, which rarely shifts out of a single mournful register.",
    "While it is more of a kids’ story, Anita Doron’s screenplay contains layers and subtleties that adults are sure to appreciate.",
    "Visually captivating even when it’s narratively uneven.",
    "The film’s episodic nature, which serves to underscore the moments of grim drama, adds to the problem. One can only salute the filmmakers’ ambition and seriousness of purpose, but it’s hard to see who The Breadwinner audience is.",
    "Cross-dressing in the story is merely a tool for survival, but such border-crossing is inevitably rife with unintended consequences beyond narrative ones."

I probably thought it was better than what others thought, but here I go. It's a beautiful tale of a girl who cuts her hair and pretends to be a boy to provide for her family in Afghanistan, as Taliban (a sexist terrorist group) threatens them. As the country is on the brink of war, they must flee, but Parvana must look for her father. Then there is also a fairy tale (will not spoil it) with beautiful animation. I have not seen \"The Secret of Kells\" but I want to. I recommend, but it can get very dark at some times.",

This is obviously notThe Breadwinner is a good movie with a subject matter not commonly found in animated movies nowadays about an Afghanan girl forced to dress like a boy in order to rescue her father who was arrested in an unfair manner. This is obviously not aimed towards children and that's a good thing because they can have some dark moments without thinking that \"it would be innappropriate for children\".The Good:-The animation looks nice. This movie shows that 2D animation still has potential even in a CGI era of animation.-The dark subject matter this movie is about.-The dialogue was good for the most part.The Bad:-Maybe the fact that it gets a little repetitive during the second act and the ending is pretty predictable. Obviously it's still satisfying but after reading the premise before watching it I pretty much predicted the ending, and I was right.-I think some characters are underused. By that I mean that they could be a lot better developed if only they had more screen time and things to do.-The character design looked a little lighthearted for the tone this movie had, but I understand that's the art style from Cartoon Saloon.These are just little nitpicks I have and doesn't ruin the experience nor it changes my mind on this movie. It's not a terrible movie, it's not a bad movie, it's not an average movie and it's not a masterpiece either, it's a good movie that I actually enjoyed and I recommend it.",

While they only have (to date) three animated films, the Secret of Kells, Song of the Sea, and now the Breadwinner, they are one of the best animated studios making beautiful animation with unique character design, interesting and stimulating visual layouts of backgrounds and worlds, and constantly changing from styles and storytelling. For this film, the Breadwinner is the company's most political and arguably personal film. While the story is fictitious, as the original author interviewed refugees from Afghanistan to depict Taliban-era life, specifically for women who live during this patriarchal period, it will definitely resonate with anyone, largely female, who have been either oppressed or doubted. But really anyone can get behind the film's central character and family through hardship, happiness, triumphs, and sadness, and getting a perspective on another life!",

Me gusto como refleja la vida de esa época, la animación y la historia oscura, que esto es muy raro de ver en películas animadas. Mas o menos pasado 1/4 de la película nos cuentan como una segunda historia, ligada de manera metafórica a la trama principal. Algunos problemas que puede llegar a tener la película es que esta segunda historia no aporta casi nada a la trama, tranquilamente uno se la puede llegar a saltear y uno no pierde nada, ademas de que hay pocos personajes y variedad de escenarios. Ademas no explica si Parvana y Baba se reunieron con su familia o que se cuente un poquitito mas sobre la guerra que estaba habiendo, o como Rafaq pudo deshacerse del guardia con la AK, pero quitando lo malo, sin duda alguna es una gran película y voy a alabar que sea muy seria, porque películas animadas SERIAS de verdad sin un humor estúpido e infantil como es costumbre a día de hoy (que por cierto odio bastante), hay muy pocas.",

The acting is terrific. Visually, it is absolutely brilliant. It uses its 2D animation style to its advantage to create some awesome scenes. Directed by Nora Twomey, the Breadwinner follows Parvana, an 11 year old Afghan girl who pretends to be a boy to provide for her family after her father was arrested by the Taliban. But instead of painting a black and white picture of Afghanistan, it takes the time to show the great aspects of the people and culture, but it doesn’t shy away from the ugliness that is prevalent throughout these countries. A relevant film to watch in this day and age, highly recommended.",
