  "critic_reviews": [
    "Led by a few strong performances, and delivering plenty of heart-clutching moments, The Bye Bye Man is sure to appeal to horror lovers of all stripes.",
    "If you miss the slasher icons of old and have little patience for the reboot attempts they get periodically, it's nice to see at least a worthy attempt to add to that pantheon.",
    "Jonathan Penner’s sharp script (from a story by Robert Damon Schneck) and Stacy Title’s assured direction keep the heat on, and there’s some resourceful misdirection that deepens the story and intensifies the scares.",
    "The young cast is generally okay. The real pleasure is the rare appearance by Oscar winner Faye Dunaway, who plays as a woman who may know how to defeat this spirit.",
    "The Bye Bye Man is cheesy, but it feels knowingly cheesy, with a heavy dose of wink-wink, nudge-nudge from the filmmakers.",
    "Title deploys a fairly effective range of horror techniques, including jump scares, misdirection and some oddly unattractive VFX to ratchet up the tension, although gore is at a minimum.",
    "Even when it seems to be making things up as it goes along, its slapdash hallucinatory quality is a token gesture toward placing you inside the characters’ heads.",
    "What we’re left with are a few PG-13 murders, uninspired performances, some not-so-scary urban legends and a couple of actresses who must be wondering how they got here.",
    "The borderline campy The Bye Bye Man is a horror movie in search of an urban legend. Based on a chapter in the 2005 collection of allegedly strange-but-true paranormal tales \"The President’s Vampire,\" the premise is second-rate Stephen King.",
    "Stacy Title’s film ends up succeeding most deftly as an advertisement for on-campus housing.",
    "The Bye Bye Man is a moldy slice of Wisconsin-set cheese, a horror film that manages as many unwanted laughs as frights.",
    "The concept is derivative of about a dozen other movies and their sequels.",
    "The Bye Bye Man had a relatively modest budget, and it shows in the special effects, which tend to be more funny than scary.",
    "Sadly The Bye Bye Man lacks both surprise and intrigue despite possessing some promise via a wild opening.",
    "Any hopes of smart social commentary or unsettling psychological underpinnings are quickly shattered by a clichéd screenplay and amateurish performances.",
    "Title’s command of the material is haphazard, her direction not artful enough to know when expository clunkiness is undercutting the chance to dig into the meat of personalities in deterioration.",
    "The Bye Bye Man is the kind of mess that happened by committee.",
    "The Bye Bye Man just skirts so-bad-it’s-good territory, unintentionally making the audience laugh more than they gasp.",
    "The Bye Bye Man is an unfathomably inept horror film; one that’s an obvious byproduct of The Babadook/It Follows brand of horror success. It is, without apology, one of the emptiest, nonsensical haunted thrillers ever to fail genre audiences.",
    "On top of the general hoariness, this is also an uncommonly, at times unbelievably inept movie; from its acting to its script to most of its technical aspects, it feels barely fit for the big screen.",
    "Speaking of the characters, they are as bland and uninteresting as can be.",
    "Horror-movie fans often have put up with a lot to get their requisite amount of fright per month, and that tolerance limit is seriously tested by this slapdash attempt to introduce a new slasher hall-of-fame character into the mix."

The acting was awful, the characters were really uninteresting (You don't find out some of their names until over half an hour in) and sometimes stupid, and the plot itself can be really silly at times. I won't spoil, but there is like three different times where a police officer is involved and none of it makes sense. Adding to that, the \"Bye Bye Man\" looks very silly. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this. It has some unintentionally funny moments, but it isn't worth your time or money unless you're just really bored.",

My hopes were shot down, way down. The trailer painted a good picture for me, but the movie itself did not live up to expectation.The opening to the movie was decently well executed, kind of campy. It set a mood for the movie that I hoped would at least be carried throughout it, the acting was below sub-par, but it at least showed potential for the rest of the movie. Until the actual movie started.After the opening sequence, we flash forward to present day where three college friends are about to go look at a creepy old house off campus to live. The three main characters of the film are Elliot, John, and Sasha, played by Douglas Smith, Lucien Laviscount, and Cressida Bonas respectively. Elliot and Sasha seem like a perfectly happy couple, and John seems like the most perfect best friend and sidekick for the two. What a happy little trio right? They’ve found the perfect house, fully furnished(your first warning sign, never take furniture from an old creepy house), Elliot and Sasha are happier than ever, and John is super pumped to be living with his best friend. All is well so why not throw a college rager.Elliot’s brother, wife, and daughter–for whatever reason you would bring your daughter to a college party is above me but you do you– show up and we learn that their parents are dead. We also meet Kim played by Jenna Kanell, who is there to get all of the bad juju out of the house, because Sasha thinks it’s creepy and something is wrong with it. Elliot goes upstairs and finds a coin on the dresser beside the bed, and tries to put it in the drawer. When he walks away the coin falls out, he opens the dresser drawer which has, ‘Don’t say it, don’t think it’ written all over it, and underneath the paper it says The Bye Bye Mab. After the party is over, Kim leads the four in some sort of weird seance and automatically has a bad feeling, she tries to leave, but Elliot needs more proof she’s really a psychic. Que the lights going out and a weird noise, and then everything gets bad really quick. Almost too quick. The next day Sasha has a terrible cold, John seems more angry than normal, and Elliot is imagining his girlfriend uttering the words ‘I love you’ to his best friend.Now, as we all know, in any type of horror movie where there’s a bad guy demon/ghost/spirit thing killing people or torturing them, there’s got to be a backstory, right? I think the biggest issue with this film was there was no backstory, to really anything. The characters were not well developed, the Bye-Bye Man himself was not developed, and nothing at all made any sense. Think of Lights Out, had there been no explanation for why things were happening the movie would have sucked, and left everyone furious not knowing what was going on. Not only was the acting, aside from Douglas Smith terrible, there really just wasn’t a lot going for the film. It had a few good scares, it made me jump once or twice, but there was no reasoning for the Bye Bye Man. There was also a strange dog, which was referred to as a hound the entire film, that had absolutely no explanation, and every so often we would get a glimpse of a train.It may seem like my review is a little all over the place and that is doesn’t make sense, but that’s kind of how the whole movie felt to me: Discombobulated and confusing. It wasn’t painful to sit through, but it definitely wasn’t enjoyable either. This is a prime example of a movie that had potential to be good, but just missed the mark. The ending did the movie justice I will say, as horror fanatics know, sometimes an unhappy ending is the best ending.In all honesty, The Bye-Bye Man seemed like the kind of movie that gets a direct to DVD release and goes straight on Netflix with a two star rating. You watch it on Friday night movie night with your girlfriends while you eat junk food and have a glass of wine, or koolaid, whatever your taste, not the type of film that gets a good marketing group and goes to theaters with hopes of raising money. There’s always one that slips through the cracks.Honestly, watching the trailer now that I’ve seen the movie just makes me mad. It had such potential to be a decent flick. Thank God for Douglas Smith being decent, I would be interested to see him in something else. As far as Cressida Bonas goes, please practice before your next film. Watching her performance was almost unbearable for me.My suggestion is to wait until this flick is out on DVD and catch it at the redbox. Pop some popcorn and get your friends over, but don’t waste the $10 to see it in theaters.",

No, it's not your typical, nonsensical, thriller-alike horror fest, even though the cover might suggest such, hence the stereotypically literary acting. A horror movie might differ on the thematic approach behind it, and is not necessarily something meant to be simply \"scary\" for the so obviously fanatic masses, it might also be the object of curiosity for people interested in the occult, complexion of plots, or stigmas regarding the context in question. With all that said... This is obviously a great movie compared to the average horror movie! From the makers of the instant classic Oculus: Devil's Mirror movie, this masterpiece seems to enact once again plot twists worth the wondering. One of the funniest things in this movie is how, the character of another race looks extremely similar to Timbo, from the Oculus movie, adding this movie some extra ironic element and approach into it...

Instead the film decides to focus on the \"don't say it, don't think it\" aspect. The idea being that the more a person thinks about it, the closer he gets. Of course once someone hears his name they're obviously going to think about it. Like I said, it's a great concept with plenty of potential. The problem is that The Bye Bye Man is content to sit back and do nothing while his victims freak themselves out. He'll feed them little visions of things that aren't there, and wait for them to kill themselves. Unfortunately for the audience none of what he's showing them is scary.Over the course of the movie we see that The Bye Bye Man's main approach to attacking these characters is to make our lead (Douglas Smith) imagine that his girlfriend is cheating on him with his best friend. He does this by playing on the character's already established insecurities. His best friend does get weirdly handsy with his girlfriend and openly flirts with her after all. None of which she discourages and even seems to kind of enjoy. All of this happens right in front of his face. Lucky for him he's \"not the jealous type.\" So it's kind of nifty to see the villain play on that. But you know what it isn't? Scary. It's just not scary. Now eventually these visions start to get a little bloodier, but there's never any sense of tension or fear. Along the way Carrie-Ann Moss for some reason and has her talent totally wasted by being shoved into a do nothing role.To top things off it's just not very well made either. With the exception of Moss, the cast is terrible. None of them can act. The worst offender by far is Cressida Bonas. Not only does she no emotion or believability, but her voice is awful. Every time she spoke I just wanted to stab myself in the ears. As soon as she opens her mouth it's like nails on a chalkboard. The characters themselves suck too. Everyone is there to make stupid decisions or bore us by being too slow to grasp what is obviously going on. Well, everyone except Lucien Laviscount. He's there to be an irrational jerk and hit on his best-friend's girl. How were we supposed to care about anyone here?When watching this you'll naturally find yourself asking why The Bye Bye Man is doing all of this. He's a very enigmatic character, but not in a good way. The movie tells us nothing about him. A shame because he's the interesting part of the movie! It's one of the things holding this movie back. There's the potential here for a cool new horror movie villain. However, it doesn't capitalize on that like A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, and Friday the 13th did by giving him a backstory. The other way they mess up is by barely having him in the movie. He's only in a few scenes. What the people making it failed to realize is that those scenes were the obvious highlights. The Bye Bye Man and his deformed dog that looks like it was pulled straight from the pits of hell are pretty cool looking and way spookier than some college student having visions about his GF and BFF hooking up behind his back.The Bye Bye Man is simply a lot of wasted potential. It squanders it's main villain, puts nothing scary onscreen, and fundamentally misuses it's the few good ideas it does have. Now, there are plenty of bad horror movies out there. Ones that are lazily made, generic, and derivative like you wouldn't believe. The issue is often now that they are bad ideas, but that it's evident that the people involved just didn't really try. That's a frustrating thing to encounter, but not as frustrating as The Bye Bye Man. Here, the problem doesn't seem to be that nobody tried it's just that they had no idea what they were doing! I've rarely seen something so inept, so incompetent in execution. Never before has a trailer been so misleading. The movie needed to be more like that. Ergo, it needed to actually have the title villain in it! It's like people saw what they could have had here, but didn't know how to get it there. They took all the wrong paths and made a terrible movie. Just don't watch it.3.5/10",

I was the first one, and I thought it was better than some of the recent big names from the same genre.Yeah, looks a mix of plenty of films. It was somewhat like 'It Follows', but less complicated. Easy to follow the characters and the story. Though from the beginning itself, it was very intentional. A decent cast and the filmmaking. It could be scary for some viewers, but I found a little edgy and well paced narration. But sadly it did not miss any of the usual horror flick formula. One of the most overused, not just in this film, but any horror films is that those film character interviewing the one of the survivours from the past.

You can tell that this was mandated by the studio, rather than the director's choice, since the plot feels like fragments are missing. However, I'm not sure how much better the film would have been with an R rating, since the acting borders on comical, making you forget that you're watching horror! The CGI looks like it was tacked onto the footage, as if done by cheap software. I saw \"The Bye Bye Man\" in a packed movie theater, but I think it was packed for a different reason than what was intended.",
