    "summary": "Thirty years after the events of the first film, a new blade runner, LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling), unearths a long-buried secret that has the potential to plunge what\u2019s left of society into chaos. K\u2019s discovery leads him on a quest to find Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a former LAPD blade runner who has been missing for 30 years.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Blade Runner 2049 is not a perfect film. The pace occasionally puts the plod in the procedural and some story elements are introduced only to drift away to the land of possible sequels. But Villeneuve has created a genuinely thoughtful piece of sci-fi which escapes the gravitational pull of its inspiration to become something - to paraphrase Dr. Eldon Tyrrell - more Blade Runner than Blade Runner.",
        "Director Denis Villeneuve (\u201cArrival\u201d) delivers a moody, visually stunning celebration of existential angst. Not that he skimps on the kind of mayhem that\u2019s de rigueur these days, but you have to wait for it \u2014 and wait for it. But when it does arrive, it\u2019s awesome.",
        "Villeneuve crafts a movie both cerebral and sensuous, as puzzling and visually striking as its predecessor. The experience should be likewise revered by next generations.",
        "Take a moment to absorb and interpret and appreciate the vibrant and gorgeous and sometimes brutal and mind-bending and occasionally incomprehensible hallucinatory epic that is Blade Runner 2049, which stands with the likes of \u201cThe Godfather Part II\u201d and \u201cTerminator 2\u201d and \u201cAliens\u201d as a sequel worthy of the original classic.",
        "Blade Runner 2049, the superb new sequel by Denis Villeneuve (\u201cArrival\u201d), doesn\u2019t just honor that legacy, but, arguably, surpasses it, with a smart, grimly lyrical script (by Fancher and Michael Green of the top-notch \u201cLogan\u201d); bleakly beautiful cinematography (by Roger Deakins); and an even deeper dive into questions of the soul.",
        "Blade Runner 2049\u2019s legacy will be estimated by both its ability to capture the spirit of the original and tell an enticing story in its own right. By virtually every measure, it succeeds \u2014 whether it\u2019s Villeneuve\u2019s careful, calculating directorial eye, Deakins\u2019 sharp, distinct cinematography, or the film\u2019s eye-popping visual design.",
        "An exquisitely crafted sequel that stands shoulder to shoulder with one of the greatest films ever made. Everyone involved is operating at the height of their powers.",
        "Ridley Scott\u2019s 1982 classic Blade Runner popularized the cyberpunk movement (a gritty mix of neo-noir and hardcore sci-fi) back in the day, but 2049 perfects it. Super-stylish and deeply human \u2014 even with androids and holograms around \u2014 the spectacular follow-up takes the detective story of the first film and turns it into a grand mythology of identity, memory, creation and revolution.",
        "Villeneuve earns every second of that running time, delivering a visually breathtaking, long-fuse action movie whose unconventional thrills could be described as many things \u2014 from tantalizing to tedious \u2014 but never \u201cartificially intelligent.\u201d",
        "That Blade Runner 2049 is a more than worthy sequel to Scott\u2019s first film means it crosses the highest bar anyone could have reasonably set for it, and it distinguishes Villeneuve \u2013 who\u2019s masterminded all of this, somehow, since making Arrival \u2013 as the most exciting filmmaker working at his level today.",
        "As bold as the original Blade Runner and even more beautiful (especially if you see it in IMAX). Visually immaculate, swirling with themes as heart-rending as they are mind-twisting, 2049 is, without doubt, a good year. And one of 2017\u2019s best.",
        "Blade Runner 2049 is a narcotic spectacle of eerie and pitiless vastness, by turns satirical, tragic and romantic.",
        "It organically expands and grows what came before. It\u2019s a deep, rich, smart film that\u2019s visually awesome and full of great sci-fi concepts, and one that was well worth the 35-year wait.",
        "Blade Runner 2049 is terrific, a worthy heir to one of the great science-fiction films of all time.",
        "Blade Runner 2049 marries its ideas to its narrative in a way that blockbusters too often fail to these days. More importantly, it puts these ideas to a poignant end, bringing its characters to tragic or bittersweet reckonings in a manner that would do any of the old sci-fi masters proud.",
        "Director Denis Villeneuve goes beyond the call of duty, with a lush, often mind-blowing refurbishing of the original sci-fi aesthetic that delves into its complex epistemological themes just as much as it resurrects an enduring spectacle.",
        "Even when its emotions risk running as cool as its palette, 2049 reaches for, and finds, something remarkable: the elevation of mainstream moviemaking to high art.",
        "The latest Denis Villeneuve achievement, Blade Runner 2049 is the rare sequel that both pushes the franchise to challenging new places and serves as a natural extension of what's come before.",
        "Do androids dream of electric sheep? Maybe. But science fiction-loving cinephiles have definitely been dreaming of a movie like Blade Runner 2049 for years.",
        "A ravishing visual colossus, Blade Runner 2049 more than lives up to its predecessor\u2019s legacy as a groundbreaking mixture of sound, images and mood.",
        "Ford\u2019s memorable performance is just one of the many ways Blade Runner 2049 surpasses the original film. Its clever and compelling storyline is another. And then of course there are Deakins\u2019 incredible images.",
        "The new film is the rare sequel that truly merits its existence, updating and expanding the themes of the 1982 original to bring them from the 20th century into the 21st. Yes, Blade Runner 2049 is one hard-working and deep-thinking replicant.",
        "The pressure on filmmakers to equal or exceed the impact of a beloved original is intense. In a case like this, when the reputation of a movie has built over decades, expectations are elevated to an almost impossible level. With Blade Runner 2049, Denis Villeneuve has met those expectations by crafting a film that rivets the attention, excites the imagination, and engages the mind.",
        "In terms of the imaginative ways it expands on the themes of the first movie, it is the rare sequel that is at least the equal of its iconic original.",
        "It is often a captivating visual marvel, using newfangled special effects in ways that aspire more to the poetic than the kinetic.",
        "It\u2019s one of the most stunningly shot films of not just this year, but the last several. I can\u2019t wait to just see it again, just to bask in its visuals without trying to follow its plot. And the sound design is so remarkable that it\u2019s almost overwhelming\u2014this is a film you don\u2019t passively watch, you experience it.",
        "For Blade Runner junkies like myself, who've mainlined five different versions of Ridley Scott's now iconic sci-fi film noir \u2013 from the release print to the Director's Cut and the Final Cut (the last two minus that voiceover Scott and Ford hated) \u2013 every minute of this mesmerizing mindbender is a visual feast to gorge on.",
        "There\u2019s a humanity in Gosling\u2019s K we haven\u2019t quite seen before in this world of frowning people and weirdos. And it\u2019s those little, subtle inflections that makes Blade Runner 2049 a success.",
        "Blade Runner 2049 isn\u2019t about what happens; it\u2019s about what this terrifying and beautiful world \u2014 how could it not be, with Roger Deakins behind the camera \u2014 tells us about life and perception and reality.",
        "Blade Runner 2049 should resonate deeply with anyone who\u2019s ever held love for the original.",
        "This hefty, gleaming franchise object owes much of its resonance to the relationship its audience might have to a three-decade-old classic. CGI ghosts, audio samples, and callbacks (\u201cmore human than human,\u201d equestrian keepsakes, a boiling pot as a suspense device) haunt the film\u2019s vast, cavernous hallways.",
        "Through sheer force of filmmaking will and mediation on what it means to be self-aware, Villeneuve\u2019s towering picture still manages to inspires awe and contains profoundly beautiful moments.",
        "Despite its flaws, one thing about Blade Runner 2049 is most welcome: it is trying to be about something. It is trying to be deep, rich, and complex. We\u2019ve grown so used to lowest-common-denominator blockbuster cinema that it\u2019s almost shocking to watch a big science-fiction movie, featuring these kinds of stars, swinging for the fences in this way. It\u2019s hard not to be impressed by, and a bit grateful for, the ambition and care evident in every frame.",
        "As shaped by Villeneuve and his masterful creative team, especially production designer Dennis Gassner and cinematographer Roger Deakins, this film puts you firmly, brilliantly, unassailably in another world of its own devising, and that is no small thing.",
        "Daring in its own right, this broodingly sumptuous saga explores the primacy of feelings, the nature of memories and the essence of being human, framed as the difference between being manufactured or born.",
        "Despite all the overlaps, this is not a simulacrum of a Ridley Scott film. It is unmistakably a Denis Villeneuve film, inviting us to tumble, tense with anticipation, into his doomy clutches.",
        "Blade Runner 2049 stands as its own film, in addition to a continuation of the sequel. It\u2019s not the bolt out of the blue the first movie was, but how could it be? Instead, as the break between installments would suggest, it\u2019s a furthering of not just the original story but the original world, and that\u2019s quite an accomplishment.",
        "Arrival director Denis Villeneuve pulls off the dare of the decade, hatching a thoughtful, expansive sequel to a sci-fi classic.",
        "Is it a perfect movie? Not quite. The middle section drags a bit through no fault of the excellent performances, but ultimately it\u2019s all of a piece, and the mid-mark pacing turns out to be a relatively minor quibble.",
        "Blade Runner 2049 is long and slow. It\u2019s never boring, but it\u2019s a little too mired in one sustained note of sadness to break out as a great experience or to stand out as a great movie. Still, there are some remarkable scenes.",
        "More impressive than moving, more thought-provoking than heartfelt \u2014 chilling in its magnificence.",
        "Every effect, each little detail in the \u201cBlade Runner\u201d sequel\u2019s formidable arsenal, creates the texture of a wondrously hideous near future, full of holographic accessories, slave-labor replicants and, as one character puts it, products and services of \u201cthe fabulous new.\u201d",
        "Mr. Villeneuve\u2019s film, by contrast, is a carefully engineered narrative puzzle, and its power dissipates as the pieces snap into place. As sumptuous and surprising as it is from one scene to the next, it lacks the creative excess, the intriguing opacity and the haunting residue of its predecessor.",
        "This new Blade Runner dazzles the audience with plenty of staggering sights but never quite matches the original\u2019s mysterious ability to suggest something even more incredible lying just beyond our ken.",
        "Careful, dutiful, and beautiful, Blade Runner 2049 cannot achieve the sublime slipperiness of Scott\u2019s masterpiece. Whether it even needs to is up to you.",
        "As a contrast to Gosling's deliberately deadened, emotionally zoned-out turn, Ford almost single-handedly amps up a film otherwise intentionally drained of character vitality.",
        "So swollen with purpose, so titanically self-conscious in its mythmaking, that at times its nearly paralyzes itself with solemnity.",
        "While it certainly stimulated and overwhelmed my senses, Blade Runner 2049 rarely got my mind whirring the way one always hopes this kind of artful, serious-minded sci-fi will.",
        "It\u2019s not mere fan service; the film tries very hard to sustain interest with new characters and developments that draw on the past without being handcuffed to it, throughout its sometimes ponderous 163-minute runtime. But far too often that attempt to be interesting fails.",
        "There\u2019s nothing close to the shock of seeing Blade Runner\u2019s Tokyo-influenced futuristic dystopia \u2014 a dismal mix of high-tech and corrosion \u2014 for the first time. I thought it was okay.",
        "There are flashes of visual grandeur in Blade Runner 2049, which was shot by the always-inventive Roger Deakins, but there\u2019s not much reason for this film to exist outside of its fan base.",
        "Denis Villeneuve\u2019s film is designed to reward the audience for recognizing references in the midst of an action pursuit, and, after an hour or so of the clipped and earnest signifying, one may find themselves nostalgic for Ridley Scott\u2019s unforced indifference to the issue.",
        "If you have two X chromosomes, or know and like someone who does, Blade Runner 2049 may not be the movie for you.",
        "Even if Blade Runner 2049 never forgets where it came from, it somehow keeps losing its way. The picture\u2019s moodiness is excessively manicured; this thing is gritty only in a premeditated way. Mostly, it feels like a capacious handbag, designed with perhaps too many extra compartments to hold every cool visual idea Villeneuve can dream up."

Since this film is directedFor those previously watched the first installment of Blade Runner or haven\u2019t seen it, it\u2019s safe to say that the latest installment of the Blade Runner franchise is easily one of the best sequels ever made PERIOD! Since this film is directed by the man who made jawdropping films like Prisoners, Sicario, and Arrival, his articulation of direction and storytelling really does capture the right atmosphere that Ridley Scott has set since the first Blade Runner. Most people that worked with Ridley Scott had already returned for another ride, but this time with Denis Villeneuve. The things that Denis had done for this installment really shines without a shadow interfering at a splitsecond while watching this. The new characters and familiar faces for this latest installment impressed me, futuristic-like production design, electrifying visual and sound effects, kickass performances, spine-chilling orgasmic soundtrack, and the god-like cinematography that Roger Deakins set really does spark a lot of amazement for the sequel. (Get Roger Deakins his OSCAR ASAP!!!!) However, there\u2019s a thing that kind of caused a very little ruckus throughout the movie, but it doesn\u2019t affect the movie\u2019s quality that much since there will be another sequel readied for us to see what lies beneath the door (If confirmed...) Like Deckard said \u201cI did your job one\u2014I was good at it\u201d it clearly refers that someone else besides Scott or Villeneuve will take control and finish the story (if confirmed..)  Without a doubt, Blade Runner 2049 is an outstanding achievement and a technical masterpiece that will be enjoyed by many sci-fi fans around the world.",

It deserves no less than a dream team of talent and thankfully that's exactly what it got. The direction is sharp, the visuals pop, the performances emanate, and the writing is true to the source without merely aping all the old notes or ruining all the mystery. Core themes of the genre it helped create like the line between illusion and reality or defining humanity and one's identity are both upheld and explored in increasingly nuanced ways. Those worried about a neo noir film devolving into an action fest can breathe too as that was oversold by the marketing. The one trademark I do miss though is Vangelis' multilayered, ever present composition. 2049 strikes a different tone and isn't afraid of quiet moments, but the absence of one of its predecessor's most defining features remains conspicuous. Still, nearly everyone involved in the project is at the top of their game and should be proud of the work they've accomplished. Time will tell exactly how well the sequel stacks up to the 'original', but in any case it comes as close one could ask for today. I can still scarcely believe it, myself.",

After that said, I'm kind of disappointed with the film and don't think its anywhere as a lot of the critics I like have stated the filmI've just finished watching Blade Runner 2049 and visually, its an amazing film that is second to none. After that said, I'm kind of disappointed with the film and don't think its anywhere as a lot of the critics I like have stated the film to be.First as a Denis Villeneuve fan who have seen all his English works (apart from Enemy), this is by far his least impressive work. The problem is not really his direction, but rather the less than impressive writing and some very on the nose-exposition that makes the world less believable as it should be. Perhaps the biggest problem with this film is that it raises a lot of questions that don't really invite intrigue as it hopes it should do. The film is plot heavy compared with the original, but unlike the original, I don't feel the world building in 2049 is as good as the original. For example, the original was always a character study with Deckard who lived in this futuristic LA who was suddenly plugged back to his job. Here we saw the cyberpunk world he lived in with many interactions between characters that seem real and genuine. However in 2049, Ryan Gosling's character is never really interacting with characters that feel part of the world, but rather characters to further the plot point.For example, many of the character interactions involve just two people who either point Gosling to somewhere or discuss exposition. You never get a sense of any of these characters. Note in the original the society seems lived in with Dekard constantly having to push people away or him drinking the alcohol at the bar which seems like what he would normally do etc. The biggest offender in 2049 is that the film has characters and events that lack consistent motivation with logic jumping points that bugged me throughout the film. Because I don't wanna spoil any of the plot really, its worth noting that a lot of what happens doesn't necessarily follow the things said or done preceding it. That said, the original Blade runner didn't really per se have much of a plot either, but which is why I've always classified the original as a character study more than anything else. Given that Villenueve is a master of this genre (given all his films are character studies), it is ultra disappointing that Ryan Gosling's character doesn't go through the same journey nor development that Deckard went through. Sure there might be some sentimental aspects that happens in the film, especially with the female characters, there is never a scene like when Deckard starts drinking (after killing Zhora) or his nod at the end that symbolises anything gone through, so when sentimental events happen in 2049, I never felt any emotion towards these events unfortunately.The other problem with 2049 is that it sets up a lot of hints of a bigger world which feels like playing an RPG game with many side quests available. In fact, I would go so far as to compare this movie as awfully similar to the Deus Ex game series. Part of the problem  lies with the co-writer Michael Green who also happen to write Alien Covenant and Logan which had the same issues popping up with this film (great premises and start, but then devovles into convuluted plots and sets up that goes nowhere)Given that the original Blade runner inspired so much of the genre we know today, its disappointing that 2049 doesn't really offer us anything new or done better in terms of the sci-fi trope. In fact, 2049 rather borrows a lot of its plot and themes from current films that have done it better. There a little bit of Her here, a little bit of Children of Men here, and even a little bit of Ex Machina, but when put together, does not feel as satisfying.Also with the extremely long movie length (I don't mind how long a film is), there could be a case made that it didnt need to take nearly 3 hours to tell this story. A lot of the film is broken into smaller dense sequences that involve people talking either about what is going on with the world, or furthering the plot. This is why I don't believe the world building is as good as the original. Whilst 2049 remains ever faithful to the Asian themes, the motif of the eyes etc, it has nowhere the ambiguity and the guts to tackle bigger issues like corporation takeover or the idea of 'white flight'. In fact, 2049 seems to abandon a lot of the themes from the original that doesn't seem to reflect in a more futurstic LA.Overall 2049 is still a dazzle of a film and is worth watching as a good sequel. However, it is clearly overstated as the acting and cinematography are great, but not so acclaimed as some might say. There are lot of things that work in this film, but I feel as though this doesn't per se elevate the film to the status as the original.

If movies are primarily about the story, the new Blade Runner sucks. There are too many unnecessary scenes, too many amazingly slow ones, and many which I like to call executions - on the surface something happens there, but indeed they are only about exposition. Every scene with annoying Jared Leto is just that: cheap exposition. Bad guys are one-dimensional, unlike Rutger Hauer in the first movie.  Rich, original environment of the first movie are now desolate ruins. Which is nice, for a second, but then you see almost all scenes are empty.

It has intellectual pretensions, but no real ideas, other than some half-baked biblical referencing. It takes a lazy, hand-waving approach to its plot and world-building. For me, that\u2019s all unacceptable. If you decide to make the sequel to one of the most revered movies of all time, you need to get your quality bar pretty damn high. Blade Runner made its name by being genuinely intellectual, and having an insane level of attention to detail. This film fails to achieve either.There are plots holes you could fit the Tyrell Corporation's headquarters through. I can\u2019t talk about those without spoiling, but lets just note that the core premise of the movie as spelled out in the opening crawl, the invention and legalisation of unquestioningly obedient replicants, is in direct contradiction to almost everything that follows, including the rationale for the mission the protagonist is sent on. The acting is fine, good even, BUT the actors are doing their best with horribly written characters who constantly make decisions that are absurd, often in order to set up action scenes that shouldn\u2019t logically occur. Where the original revelled in moral ambiguity, we get a cartoonish boss villain who looks and talks like an evil-yoga instructor and appears to live in a health spa, and an even more cartoonish hot-lady-assassin henchwoman. In keeping with that Holywoodisation, all the women in the film are presented as lust objects, either evil or victims, and not in the knowing sense of exploited Zhora or Rachel, but as sadistic titillation.There are a bunch of scenes basically nicked from other movies, in particular Spike Jonze\u2019s brilliant Her.Where the original asked genuinely profound philosophical questions about what it means to be human, this one has some quasi-religious guff about miracles and souls that jars badly with the paranoid, psychological Dickian source material and the post-religious bio-technological world that was presented in the first film.The world building is terrible.The world we are shown also doesn\u2019t tie in with the mostly deserted, \u201ckibble\u201d strewn dying earth of the original. That was a place where almost all the able-bodied have left for the off-world colonies and the only remaining animals were manufactured. Despite some kind of second eco-disaster and a tech disaster both fleetingly referred to in the opening crawl (and in Matrix2esque short films on youtube), the world presented here is less dilapidated, more progressive, more organised, etc. than in the original. Fading art -deco has been replaced by Scandinavian design.The technology is all over the place. Again, that\u2019s hard to talk about without getting into spoilers, but basically the film assumes that flawless AI\u2019s and super functional \u201cnormal\u201d robots/drones exist, and then doesn\u2019t in any way address the ramifications of how those facts would impact the whole idea/purpose/issue of replicants, and how and why they are used, and how/why Blade Runners are used to track them down. I think that comes back to a recurring problem ideas being included because someone thought they were \u201ccool\u201d rather than being story/world driven.There are constant heavy handed and unconvincing analogies beween replicants, and real-world slavery and racism which the film then does nothing to explore.In some ways it\u2019s a bit like the Force Awakens, another recent reboot that I hated. It\u2019s a technically competent film that heavily references the original, in terms of props, characters and art style. It even features Harrison Ford. It has a plot driven by a series of improbable coincidences and chance discoveries that seems more like an excuse for \u201ccool visuals\u201d than a logical, character driven progression. But whereas the Force Awakens knew exactly what it wanted to be, going unashamedly for a nostalgia-fuelled, international, mass market audience, B2049 falls between stools.I feel a lot of people are going to disagree with my negativity on this one. There\u2019s massive hype and hope around this movie, and it is mostly beautiful. Understandably, Blade Runner fans will want to like this movie. but going back to the Force Awakens comparison, after six months have passed, and people have moved through denial and anger stages, the sad reality of how average this film is will sink in.I went in to this one with mixed expectations. I loved Arrival, the director\u2019s previous foray into SF, but on the other hand I thought that a reboot of Blade Runner was an inherently bad idea. For me, this one failed hard, both as a sequel and as general entertainment.",

Over the top exposition that drones on and on to overly explain and give feeling of importance to an unimportant plot.  So the plot goes something like this;  Rachel and Deckard had a child. so the movie spends 2 hours trying to convince you its important somehow. CGI Rachel was the lowest point of the movie, with the villain suggesting that it was planned for Rachel & Deckard to meet in some sort of master plan.There are a handful of good scenes in this movie. Such as the opening scene, or in some of the visuals. But much of it is style over substance. The good pieces are far and few. And in between are just horribly long expository scenes where characters you dont care about talk about nothing at all. Nothing important or interesting happens throughout this entire movie. Just some stuff happens, some nice visuals thrown in, then it's over. I just wanted something to happen that I could care about. ANYTHING. go down in the streets. show what life is like down there. Let things happen on screen. Get me invested in a character or in the world. I just got so tired of boring people talking. Many of the sets are bland and uninspired. Bland white walls and bland white floors. or yellow walls and yellow floors. Don't bother if you enjoy the small details, because they aren't there. Many of the environments look sterile and lack the Blade Runner 1982 details. The Original movie wasnt like this at all. The environments were dirty, messy. unorganized, and lived in. You don't get that feeling at all in 2049. I get it that its supposed to be like 30 years later. But come on. This isnt meant to be **** star wars.The soundtrack was calm and sentimental at times, and then at other times very obnoxious and loud. I didn't enjoy the tone of this movie. The original soundtrack by Vangelis was beautiful. But this was like a dying cat at times. Also, dubstep. Really? What I would have liked to see in a new Blade Runner film would be a grounded movie about a Blade Runner who hunts replicants. We got that in the opening scene like an appetizer. But then the rest of the movie is just up in the clouds, trying hard to push its meaningless plot as interesting and meaningful when in actuality it isn't. Blade Runner 2049 is style over substance.My rating: Mediocre",

This is a Denis Villeneuve film, and anybody versed with the man's filmography will realize that this is an artist of the highest order. Had Blade Runner been given to anybody- even Ridley, I can guarantee you the final result wouldn\u2019t be half as good as what we see here. Ryan Gosling takes over the role played by Harrison Ford in the 1982 original and he essays an effortlessly cool protagonist living in the future of decay and destitute. Harrison Ford is also back in a glorified cameo but its glad to see the old man back in this Universe. The special effects are amazing with a careful mixture of carefully rendered CGI and practical effects. The film looks fantastic, but it is the plot that is the heart and soul of this great film. You should go and watch Blade Runner before seeing 2049 and then come and marvel at this masterpiece. One of the best recent science fiction films.(Denis Villeneuve has created a masterpiece).",

Roger Deakins' cinematography is stunning in every way.

It was one of most profound and beautiful movies of the 20th century and it still affects me to this day..When I saw Ryan Gosling cast in the 2049 I was very disappointed. I swore to myself never to attend a movie of his again after the disgusting abomination that is \"Only God Forgives\" but I relented eventually, Blade Runner is that important.. He is the weakest part of the movie for me. I just don't like his voice or face. Thats personal preference.And what is the movie? A continuation of the transhumanist question from Blade Runner 1. Can replicants ( or even AI's who receive very positive treatment here) have souls? Can man be a God and create life? My anwswer is no and the movie answers in the affirmative, understandably. Judge for yourself.Symbolism and esotericism saturate every scene. Every line of dialogue, prop, stance, quirk, image,prominent and obscured has an obvious meaning ...and  hidden one...It feels religious in its exposition because in a way it is. Its arcane and occultist. It makes one think and want to return for closer inspection.

It executes nearly everything to perfection, continuing to build upon some of the great aspects of the first film while being able to avoid some of the narrative blunders of the original. The setting and visuals of the film are beyond beautiful. It does a great job of building upon the already majestic world of blade runner while adding some unique aspects of its own that helps it not feel like just an extension of the first film. The music is subtly very good as it helps you feel immersed into the film while not feeling overbearing. The narrative and characters are the things that stand out most about the film. Despite being nearly 3 hours long, it almost never feels boring and is captivating the whole way through. The only time I noticed that the film slowed down a bit was around the end of the first hour of the film, but quickly picks back up again and is incredibly engaging the rest of the way through. Ryan Gosling gives a great performance as he usually does and Harrison Ford gives one of the best performances of his career.

If that's something you enjoy then this is an amazing film.  One that I hope will set the bar for films to come despite not bringing in much at the box office.",

I thought that I\u2019d need to see and enjoy the original before this. Denis Villeneuve quotes you don\u2019t need to have seen the original to enjoy his film cos this stands on its own. Though a lot of the film does involve the original in its plot. So I sat down to watch this juggernaut of a film, and juggernaut I mean 2 hours 43 mins. You do get sceptical as why it\u2019s that long and think am I wasting my time and money here but. And big but. I watched Mark Kermode gives his review. He said that opening 30 mins of the movie surprisingly set the amazing pace and that in itself defines the greatness of this epic film. There are no standout performances here, not Gosling, not Ford, no one but there is one and that is the director Denis Villeneuve. What he delivers here is something of awesomeness, something astonishing. The visuals, the lighting, everything about the design and scale of this is just mind blowing. You definitely don\u2019t have to enjoy the original to enjoy this. And at 163 mins, it doesn\u2019t feel that long at all. This really is the creme de la creme of sci fi perfection. And ok I said earlier that Gosling and Ford aren\u2019t the standout performers but there performances are brilliant. Gosling\u2019s performance is of particular interest considering a year ago he was nominated for best actor for La La Land. But forget La La Land here. This is simply put the greatest sci fi, action thriller ever made. Denis Villeneuve your the man. Shame you didn\u2019t get a best director nod at this years Oscars, just the nomination would have sufficed. 5 out 5, 10 out 10.",

Denis Villeneuve said that the original cut was 4 hours and I definitely want to see that cut. I want like a Blade Runner 2049 Part II. I never have this urge to see more of a world created by such amazing people, but I do for this movie. I love the way how the story isn't finished (except for Joe) and that it continues without us knowing how, It leaves open possibilities for the future. The cast was also very strong and I like the way how the movie just starts without us knowing who any of these people are. As the story moves along you get more and more invested in Joe's character and want him to find out the truth. The cinematography is also very well done, the best I've seen so far.

This new Blade runner a an excellent movie nonetheless. I've read some bad reviews before watching the film and was kinda sceptical, but in the end this movie is about as good a sequel can get. The visuals obviously are astonishing, the music is creepy and moody, and the story is gripping, good enough for me. Still It has some weaker moments, especially the last 20-30 minutes. The movie then become a bit messy and schizophrenic. But It's those crucial last 20 minutes that would have made Blade Runner 2049 a masterpiece like the first, but it kinda miss the spot. I also didn't like the Jared Leto character, the guru who speaks in parabolas and metaphors...it felt a bit clich\u00e9 to me. Despite all that i can't give a lower score than 9, since the movie overall really lives up to the expectations.

I had watched the first one before and was impressed by how little dialogue was needed to move the plot along and to convey the message. Most recent movies left me with a sower aftertaste and with the impression that it was numbed down by having a huge amount of dialogue and explanations. The original used the atmosphere, the sounds and the characters to tell it's story and the difference from the modern approach was really obvious.  The feeling i had while watching the original i found again while seeing 2049.It is a sequel but without making you feel that not watching the original was a big mistake.  This was the one movie in a very long time that did not disappoint me. I have loved it. It is something else and i could go on and on about the plot twist that was introduces incredibly well but at the same time was not in your face and then what happened afterwards when you felt that you passed the traditional twist...
