Elio enjoys a close relationship with his father (Michael Stuhlbarg), an eminent professor specializing in Greco-Roman culture, and his mother Annella (Amira Casar), a translator, who favor him with the fruits of high culture in a setting that overflows with natural delights. While Elio’s sophistication and intellectual gifts suggest he is already a fully-fledged adult, there is much that yet remains innocent and unformed about him, particularly about matters of the heart. One day, Oliver (Armie Hammer), a charming American scholar working on his doctorate, arrives as the annual summer intern tasked with helping Elio’s father. Amid the sun-drenched splendor of the setting, Elio and Oliver discover the heady beauty of awakening desire over the course of a summer that will alter their lives forever.… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "There is such tenderness to this film. I was overwhelmed by it.",
    "Chalamet, with his restless, impatient physicality and a face as sensual and sculpted as a fallen angel from a Caravaggio painting, is quite simply astonishing.",
    "Call it what you want but this movie is an instantly fond memory.",
    "As for words? The script gives Stuhlbarg – a character actor who elevates everything he’s in – the monologue of a lifetime, which he delivers sotto voce, all kindness. And that is perhaps the prevailing note of Call Me by Your Name – of kindness, of tenderness.",
    "An almost sinfully enjoyable movie that both observes and obeys the languid rhythms of a torrid Italian summer.",
    "Call Me By Your Name is a triumph of humanity.",
    "Call Me By Your Name is a masterpiece of subtle emotions, intense sensuality and breathtaking beauty.",
    "Chalamet is quite something, but Hammer is a match for him, as he needs to be, if the characters’ passions are to be believed.",
    "It’s a tale of totality, not during an eclipse but during a brief conjunction that changes at least one life surprisingly, and one of the greatest pleasures of the movie year.",
    "Chalamet gives the performance of the year. By any name, this is a masterpiece.",
    "Guadagnino’s storytelling is overpoweringly intimate but never narcissistic. He directs our gaze both inward and outward, toward the treasures and mysteries buried within this Italian paradise, and also toward the unseen, unspoken forces that have threatened bonds like Elio and Oliver’s for millennia.",
    "First love is as much about hesitancy as it is about exuberance – maybe even more so – and Ivory and Guadagnino perfectly capture that sweet turmoil, aided by a gifted ensemble. This isn’t just an instant LGBT classic; this is one of the great movie love stories, for audiences of all stripes.",
    "It summons an erotic orientation toward the world with all its power, and then pours it onto the audience. It is, undoubtedly, Guadagnino’s masterpiece.",
    "Call this movie by its name: Masterpiece.",
    "This is the kind of movie you live in as much as watch. Some of its images—Hammer’s Oliver dancing with unselfconscious abandon, Chalamet’s face in extended close-up in the stunning final shot—stay with you afterward like memories of your own half-remembered romance.",
    "It's a swooning new classic and one of the very best films of the year.",
    "Guadagnino adeptly captures not just the physicality of a burning love but also the emotional and intellectual components, and the film is all the more salient for that careful, realistic interpretation.",
    "Far and away the best movie of the year.",
    "Stuhlbarg, who’s a treasure throughout, gets a fatherly monologue towards the film’s end that’s so observantly and tenderly performed, you can barely catch your breath. It’s one beautiful moment in a film that’s filled with them – gone in a heartbeat, but leaving the kind of ripples that reach across a lifetime.",
    "Peachy keen. A luminous, sun-kissed Italian love story brimming with warmth, passion and feeling. This is utterly unmissable.",
    "A film that’s at once light, joyful and emotionally devastating, with deeply affecting central performances. A full-hearted romantic masterpiece.",
    "Capturing the agony and ecstasy of young love, Call Me by Your Name is a major addition to the queer cinema canon - a deeply felt movie that's bittersweet, tender and true.",
    "Call Me by Your Name has a choking emotional intensity that will be apparent to anyone who’s ever dared to reach out to another.",
    "It’s a transcendent love story, and a work of overwhelming empathy.",
    "Call Me By Your Name is a masterful work because of the specificity of its details.",
    "The chemistry between the men is palpable, but what's more important, they convey their characters' complex emotions, expectations and thoughts without necessarily opening their mouths.",
    "The final beats of Guadagnino’s adaptation galvanize two hours of simmering uncertainty into a gut-wrenchingly wistful portrait of two people trying to find themselves before it’s too late.",
    "Outside of a few short moments in Ismail Merchant and James Ivory’s “Maurice,” and Ang Lee’s “Brokeback Mountain,” the love and intimacy between two male characters has never truly felt this real or emotionally heartbreaking in a theatrical context. It’s almost revolutionary. It’s cinematic art.",
    "Even as he beguiles us with mystery, Guadagnino recreates Elio’s life-changing summer with such intensity that we might as well be experiencing it first-hand. It’s a rare gift that earns him a place in the pantheon alongside such masters of sensuality as Pedro Amodóvar and François Ozon, while putting “Call Me by Your Name” on par with the best of their work.",
    "The potential for a tryst hangs heavily in the humid Mediterranean air; every look and line of dialogue drips with subtext. But Call Me By Your Name’s erotic tension wouldn’t crackle so loudly without the chemistry between its leads.",
    "It’s real life, heartbreaking and sublime.",
    "It’s a film of overwhelming empathy and playfulness as loneliness turns into gratification and desires are slowly manifested into reality.",
    "Call Me by Your Name is a lush, heartbreakingly beautiful film about first love, but also the glories of youth, when everything is new and any number of paths open before you.",
    "Each element is carefully calibrated, but deployed with consummate grace—this is a film to rush to, and to then savor every minute of.",
    "Call Me by Your Name is less a coming-of-age story, a tale of innocence and loss, than one about coming into sensibility. In that way, it is about the creation of a new man who, the story suggests, is liberated by pleasure that doesn’t necessarily establish sexual identity.",
    "Guadagnino does a remarkable job of capturing the tension and anxiety that comes with not only first love, but first-time queer romances.",
    "It’s a beautiful, supremely touching performance from Chalamet which gives this surprisingly safe story its moving purity.",
    "A richly detailed sexual and emotional coming of age story, the movie’s based on a novel and it unfolds novelistically, through glances and asides and slowly accreting observations.",
    "Guadagnino has explored this territory before...and he’s a master at finding electricity in a glance, beauty in a beam of sunlight, an entire story in the whisper of one name.",
    "Chalamet is excellent, saving his purest acting for the killer final shot several minutes in length, when we finally see what these weeks with Oliver have meant to him.",
    "The way it explores at length the sweet and sour aspects of first love is worth savoring.",
    "The sex scene between the men is super sensual, just like the rest of the film, but still subtle.",
    "Chalamet and Hammer map this progression expertly.",
    "Perhaps best remembered as a showcase for Stuhlbarg, who delivers a poignantly beautiful monologue that eclipses everything else in the film.",
    "It’s a beautiful film, finely written and well acted.",
    "Armie Hammer’s performance is a brilliant exercise in subtlety, suggesting a genial yet inappropriate space-taking, the carelessness of the beautiful.",
    "Call Me by Your Name, the latest film from Italian director Luca Guadagnino, is a study in mood and emotion. It’s about living in the moment and capturing that moment. It’s about using the canvas of film to convey to the audience the inner feelings of the characters. Call Me by Your Name is short on dialogue and long on emoting.",
    "The sensuous atmosphere often preempts the drama. Neither Elio nor (especially) Oliver are quite rich enough as characters to outshine their surroundings, and, although it’s rare to see a movie of this sort that is so markedly nonjudgmental, the lack of sharp conflict doesn’t make for a terribly invigorating experience.",
    "Call Me By Your Name is a romanticized coming of age film, for better and worse. It’s a lovely place to visit but not particularly absorbing as a narrative, even though Armie Hammer gives an impressive performance.",
    "Call Me by Your Name is a fairly straightforward coming-of-age story that's at its finest in moments when the relationships take on larger meanings than their literal context implies, and Luca Guadagnino finds evocative aesthetic expressions for them.",
    "Perhaps this multilingual, almost-pre-AIDS idyll does not stretch credulity – the family is surely based on Aciman’s own internationalist clan – but it can try the patience.",
    "Call Me by Your Name isn’t so much a bad movie as a dull, bloated one, a tale of teen sexual intensity drawn out beyond the point of holding our interest, footnoted with all these spoken (repeatedly, by one and all) provisos — “This is OK because…” That’s all well and good, but I found it lacking as drama (no parental conflict), romance and period piece, a turgid potboiler overheated under the Tuscan sun.",
    "Though Chalamet and Hammer are up to the task of communicating a competition of desire with as few words as possible, they offer up a dare and a proposition that Guadagnino and his film never fully take on. Maybe they’re afraid of the consequences."

The novel grabbed my heart in January and by July I was touring Italy, reading passages on the beach in the town where its set, strolling through the side street in Rome where Oliver and Elio share their final nightWhere do I begin? The novel grabbed my heart in January and by July I was touring Italy, reading passages on the beach in the town where its set, strolling through the side street in Rome where Oliver and Elio share their final night together. It is the gay romance of my lifetime, having grown up in the era of its setting, asking the same questions of myself that Elio does (only failing the question, \"Is it better to speak or to die?\"). Elio doesn't fail - he speaks and it changes his life, for better or worse. The movie captures that turning point in his young adulthood and brings it to glorious life, replete with the inevitable pain. Hopefully without spoiling anything, the fire that is lit within him will burn for a lifetime and into the viewer's heart during a crushing final scene that glances over every possible emotion but ending on determination and hope. For the love of God, don't leave this movie when the credits start to roll. And be a good movie citizen and let everyone you know who will be seeing it to do the same.  Guadanigno, the director, is painterly but nothing without the astonishing performances, especially from Timothee Chalamet who brings Elio to life in a way I haven't seen a young actor do since Timothy Hutton broke through in \"Ordinary People\" almost forty years ago.  Armie Hammer crosses the Rubicon with his performance as Oliver, becoming the master of his creative domain and I can't wait to see what he does in the future.  Stuhlbarg as Elio's father is kind, compassionate, clear-eyed and so very wise and his final talk with his son is almost Shakespearean in word and delivery. While the words are never spoken, his monologue is the paternal 'to be or not to be' that every gay kid would cherish and every straight kid needs to hear.  The women are all highly memorable and its a shame that they're a bit lost in the shuffle with the acclaim for the film (that none of them are American actors might play a part).  Call Me By Your Name is a work of cinematic art, the kind that is rarely given and even more rarely appreciated.  But it exists and thanks to its creators, from page to screen, I feel like a wiser, less cynical person. When is the last time a movie had that sort of effect. 10/10",

But the reviews here are proof that this is not a film that Hollywood, Oscars, are ready to accept. 70% of the negative reviews are not even reviews, are comments alledging to pedophilia, and it´s quite obvious that this comes from the fact that is a queer film. On the other hand, I quote a Slate article: \"In trying to think through these issues in Call Me by Your Name, I called Joseph Fischel, a Yale scholar who has written on the messy politics of age and consent for Slate. He noted our society’s intense focus on age and sexuality is a relatively recent notion, not a long-settled one, and that while the law may have a legitimate need to be blunt and rigid, our art does not. In my view, it’s reasonable to be disturbed by the unconventional relationship in Call Me by Your Name, but it’s not reasonable to say the movie endorses pedophilia, or really any kind of power-based abuse, just because it depicts that relationship. If we go down that censorious and unnuanced path with our art, very little will survive the trip.\"There are films more related to pedophilia, or that \"age-gap\" argument, and they are not even pointed. Like... Idk, \"The reader\"? This is a film of love. I adore it, it´s perfectly made & if you are open minded enough, it will leave you thinking in that first time your heart crushed. It´s beyond 2:30 minutes.",

Prior to seeing the film, I was not familiar with Luca Guadagnino's work, but now I want to see more of his films, and I will keep an eye out for him in the future. Call Me by Your Name is about the son (Emilio) of an eccentric professor who develops feelings for his father's new resident, who's name is Oliver. There is immediate sexual tension between the two characters, even though Oliver is markedly older than Emilio, who is only 17. Emilio hasn't revealed his sexual preferences to anybody, but it's easy to notice his immediate attraction to Oliver. Oliver attempts to keep his distance because he knows that developing a relationship with the younger Emilio may be inappropriate, given the circumstances. However, despite his resistance, he eventually caves in to his desires and becomes sexually involved with Emilio. You can sense Emilio's conflicted conscience throughout the film, and it builds until he is forced to confront questions that he has been purposefully avoiding. The film ends with closure and sadness, but there is a silver-living that leaves you feeling good and optimistic. The best scene of the film is unquestionably the one that comes at the end when Emilio has the impending conversation with his father about his relationship with Oliver. Such a heartfelt moment, and the professor's words were absolutely moving. Everything about this film was incredible. It made you feel as if you were there in Italy, and I felt the urge to book a ticket the next day. This is easily one of the best films of the year, if not the best. I give it a 9.5/10.",

This movie drives home every buried emotion a human has ever had by daring to be unabashedly romantic, and so cheesy it becomes authentic. Never has a script enticed such an emotional response from my core. The last time I remember a film even approaching the emotional grandeur of Call Me By Your Name was The Place Beyond the Pines. Prepare to sit through the last moment of the credits, as the final shot of the film is the most powerful shot ever committed in a romance movie.

There is aMore than just a movie, Call Me By Your Name is an experience. It's immersive, inviting you into this gorgeous Italian summer and truly putting you in these characters' shoes, with an empathy not many movies are able to evoke. There is a perfect balance between realism and idealization. It plays like a memory you hold very dear and romanticize, which very much captures the book's feel. The performances are subtle and the characters feel incredibly real, but there's also a dream-like quality to the entire thing that makes it a truly delicious watch. Speaking of the performances, Armie Hammer is incredible Oliver, a character who could've easily been one-note. Oliver's a confident, sometimes borderline rude American grad student who is given no backstory or depth in the book, as we know him only from Elio's point of view, but Hammer's understated performance gives the character a vulnerability that makes you see right through him and understand him without being offered any information at all. Michael Stuhlbarg is also great as professor Perlman, delivering a speech that is in a way a more tender and intimate version of Spencer Tracy's in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner. But even though the entire ensamble delivers, it's Timothée Chalamet's performance that truly makes the movie. In his breakout role as Elio, he delivers what is without doubt one of the strongest performances of the year, if not the single best one. It's him who could make or break the movie, and his portrayal of this intelligent, strange, vulnerable young man is one that crackles with life and elevates this movie to a masterpiece. He's a joy to watch, and his Elio is a fully realized person you feel you truly know by the time the credits role -- or maybe even more *while* the credits are rolling, as a gorgeously haunting original song by Sufjan Stevens plays.All in all, this movie is deserving of every word of praise it's been getting, and it does an incredible job at portraying real people bringing a beloved book to life.",

Unlike Blame it on Rio, this hook-up is fully endorsed by the kid's parents, and it, therefore, obviously, doesn't have the same taboo feel to it.  It also lacks Rio's sense of humor.  The critical drawback of this film is how timid it is with respect to the gay sex scenes.  I mean, they show SO MUCH MORE of the kid hooking up with the local girl, yet when he hooks up with his older male lover, they pan away.  The director of this film should look to Greg Araki or the makers of Queer as Folk to see how it's done tastefully. What saves the film is the brilliant conversation between father and son, reflecting on what the son had in this particular relationship. A model for parents of gay children, I would guess.",

To the villa of Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg), the father of 17-year-old Elio (Timothée Chalamet), arrives assistant Oliver (Armie Hammer) for the summer. Everyone loves him: from the maid Mafalda to local beauties. But most of all he is sympathetic to the young Elio, who can not fully determine his feelings for the guest. Italian director Luca Guadagnino presents the adaptation of the novel by André Asiman about the first love and its complexities.\"Call me by your name\" - like a long-awaited trip to a country house from a noisy megapolis. Here, the silence of a summer day is broken only by the call for lunch or a horn of a bicycle. Peaches are ripening on branches, pending until they are ripped off. The pool is always filled with water and waits for someone. Here you go out for breakfast, when everyone has already had lunch. And the nights are as hot as everyday life: discos, walking with friends, swimming in the lakes. And in this idyll he invades, americano, riotous and bright, like a wind on a rocky cliff, bringing confusion to Elio's plans for the summer. Oliver introduces the professor's son to new feelings and experiences, which are unknown to him. But Guadagnino does not go into tragedy, he adapts Asiman's novel brightly and sometimes funny. The filmmaker took the best of Asiman's novel and smoothed out the rough erotic edges, so the scenes of the intimate closeness of the characters were shot as decently as possible, and even the episode with peach can not be called very vulgar. Guadagnino removed from the adaptation the girl Vimini, who was sick with leukemia, he decided to concentrate on the feelings of the main characters, and not on the secondary lines. But also the director deliberately excluded Elio and Oliver's meeting 15 years later, so as not to turn the film into a complete statement, but leave a feeling of understatement, as well as between the characters themselves.During one of the dinners at the villa, one of the Perlman's guest says the phrase: \"Cinema is not a reflection of reality, but a filter for it.\" That Asiman in the novel and Guadagnino in the film created a partly fabulous story of the first love with its difficulties and delights. \"Call me by your name\" - a coming of age drama (magical in its atmosphere), a movie about growing up through the first experience and about what it means to be alive and free.",

I keep turning this film over and over in my mind, looking for a flaw, and I can't find one. The performances - Timothee Chalamet and Michael Stuhlbarg in particular - are excellent. The script builds drama so incrementally you hardly notice it, in such a way that the final 20 minutes, despite resisting any melodramatic contrivance or hysteria, overwhelmed me emotionally. Kudos to director Luca Guadagnino for realizing this delicate tone with evocative but unfussy framing, bang-on casting, and marrying a modern perspective with a classical sense of pace and purpose. Call Me by Your Name is a gorgeous ode to the ecstasy and agony of growing up; to the sunshine of discovery and the shadow of wisdom; to the \"mystery of love\" we spend our whole lives puzzling over.",

Telling the story of two young gay men in love in Italy in the 1980s, it almost has a cinema verite like quality to it.

Michael Stuhlbarg, who plays Elio's father, delivers a final speech to Chalamet that transcends anything I've seen in film this past year.

Its poetry; an ode to love, life and discovering who you are. Its ravishing from beginning to end. I wont go into details or the plot, thats something you should experience for yourself. I do have one thing to say. I've read on this site some negative reviews suggesting the glamorization of pedophilia. THIS IS COMPLETELY FALSE! Our society’s intense focus on age and sexuality is a relatively recent notion, not a long-settled one, and that while the law may have a legitimate need to be blunt and rigid, our art does not. In my view, it’s reasonable to have different opinions of the unconventional relationship in Call Me by Your Name, but it’s not reasonable to say the movie endorses pedophilia, or really any kind of power-based abuse, just because it depicts that relationship. (there is not ONE predatory moment between the two characters in the film.) If we go down that censorious and unnuanced path with our art, very little will survive the trip. Oh, and I also read a negative review that said if this was an older guy and a younger girl, people would freak out, well,  thats already happened. Its called DIRTY DANCING. Same age difference.

Now, after the opening credits of Call Me by Your Name kick off the film’s wide survey of art history’sHaving partial Italian blood in my veins, I particularly enjoy when that culture gets some rare, overdue representation in cinema. Now, after the opening credits of Call Me by Your Name kick off the film’s wide survey of art history’s continual impact on Italy’s culture, temptation strongly urges me to book a flight to Italy! Director Luca Guadagnino (A Bigger Splash) succeeds at raising immediate love for Italy’s artful history with a masterful focus on the little details crafted to immerse you into the Jewish-American-Italian-French family over the summer.The production crew’s delicate artistry swells your eyes, thanks to Guadagnino’s relaxing artistic direction. The cinematography by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom overblows the sun’s highlights in the frame until the snow peacefully mellows out the inner chaos. The thin, loose fabric costumes designed by Giulia Piersanti practically weep while they turn their wearers into zombies decomposed by pain. To top it off, the calm dancing musical selection’s reflective piano tune juxtaposes the visualized teen angst.Those small enriched elements craft the protagonist of the story, Elio, a teenager who hunches over the piano, overcome by his insecure fervor, his space evaded by flies, supposedly awaiting someone like St. John the Baptist to pull him out of his hell hole. Then once Oliver, the family researcher, comes to stay over the summer, he spends extra time in the backyard pool alongside his new friend, a confusing curiosity in mind.With each performance fueled by the struggle against the anonymous, the two lead characters grow up over the painful season. The harsh summer weather outside seems to kill them both slowly in support to one of the feature’s many stated philosophies: “nature has a cunning way of finding our weakest spot.”Though unfortunately, some cultural issues outside the visual cues still taint the experience, including a couple of stereotypical old, angry comic relief Italians who disrupted the natural flow of the genre. Oliver’s story also lacks enough establishment: where does his romantic infatuation to a seventeen-year-old boy originate? The closest thing to a justification about his romantic spark is the Jewish background they both share, which still lacks needed prominence within the relationship.The two other female roles, Elio’s mother and girlfriend, seem to subsist just to comfort his pain, the mother in particular could have been written out completely without hurting the script. Yet European masculinity carries even greater problems in depiction. Oliver is the one representative of America, a country with a higher age of consent than Italy, so this film supposedly encourages pedophilia, as if the United Kingdom believes their legal system has a better understanding of existentialism than the United States.Although, the homosexual love still rings true in its natural approach. It starts innocent enough as Elio and Oliver just so happen to share a bathroom, the toilet in plain sight from the bed’s perspective. As time goes by, the connection they share turns into one of forbidden fruit. In one scene, passion between the two brims in the majesty of the mural of Adam’s creation, in another, Olio’s loneliness resorts him to ejaculate into a cored apricot. The chemistry between Armie Hammer (The Social Network) and Timothée Chalamet (Interstellar, Lady Bird) creates the impeccably heartful moments, tension set by emphasized distance in the framing.But most of all, the technicians’ subtle cues acutely capture the essence of being a teenager trying to figure out sexuality: the crew dresses Chalamet to look scrawny in his wardrobe, his hair messed up, his strut insecure, as editor Walter Fasano (A Bigger Splash) completes it by lingering on the star’s complexion to show a teen's dim psychology. These elements, when together, stick hard into your arteries a good long hour after the motion picture’s emotive final frame.Looking beyond the uneasy subject matter, a very plain application can be taken away: love hurts. Even I myself, a heterosexual, felt Elio’s heartbreak before, since an old desire to love a certain someone back in high school continues to hurt me today; I know loving somebody you cannot hold hurts more physically than emotionally. Despite those unpredictable moods, just remember: loved ones, including friends and family, not just romantical partners, are always there offer free hugs. These are the ones who most want to see the best come out of you and take action in your life to make sure you get to your highest point. This key takeaway of Call Me by Your Name reminds us all that whatever, however, you think, you deserve love.",

The cinematography and visuals are spectacular; this film definitely created a desire to book my tickets to Italy. The music is dreamy and serene, much like summer. The chemistry between the actors are effortless and genuine. While Armie Hammer (Oliver) was good, his performance was probably the weakest of the four primary characters. Esther Garrell and Michael Stuhlbarg were excellent as Elio's parents. However, Elio himself, played by Timothee Chalamet was simply spectacular. There are so many well-crafted scenes; in particular, the scene where Elio is speaking to his father got me choked up; something I haven’t experienced watching a film in quite some time. In the end, “Call Me by Your Name” is a film that explores the pleasure and anguish of growing up; specifically discovering our identity. Which can be confusing but also rewarding.

In the movie Elio (Chalamet) is 17 so Oliver (Hammer) should be around 30 to 36 years old. That's some serious pedophilia over there and i couldn't get over it for the whole movie.Is not romantic, is quite sick. There is not an antagonist in this movie besides time. They make a big deal about hiding their affair because it's an homosexual relationship and all but then EVERYONE seems to be okay with it. Elio's father later in the movie confesses to his sons that he had an affair with a friend (male) when he was younger and that he always knew about Elio and Oliver relationship.So why hiding if apparently is okay for everyone if they are gay? Also, Elio is a jerk to his friend Marzia with whom he has sex multiple times just to dump her a couple of days later to be with Oliver. So Elio, although sympathetic, is the only \"Bad\" character of the movie. From a technical point of view this movie is incredible, great aesthetics and imagery, but the story is weak and meaningless.Meaningless could summarize this film story perfectly in my opinion.You get nothing out of it, it doesn't have a deeper meaning and characters don't learn anything besides Elio knowing that he's gay/bisexual",

Wait for the summer to come?” Oliver shoots back. That only gets a chuckle from Elio, but that line nails the initial mood of Call Me by Your Name, Luca Guadagnino’s sumptuous new romance, which follows a deep connection that springs out of those restless days of late adolescence.The intimacy Guadagnino (and James Ivory, who wrote the film’s script) finds in these characters is present from the beginning, but Chalamet (a 21-year-old budding superstar whom I knew best from an old season of Homeland) is the audience’s way in, as a boy on the verge of adulthood who develops immediate, if confused, attraction to the confident Oliver. Not long after the two first meet, Elio retires to his room and reclines in his bed, looking at the tuft of hair sprouting from his armpit, and lazily blowing on it. A few scenes later, Elio is bold enough to sneak into Oliver’s empty room and put Oliver’s swimsuit over his head",

Some gay readers have even claimed that it may be the author's deep-seated fantasy that he kept for so long until he released this book. And now, after 10 years since the novel became a canon for LGBT romance, Luca Guadagnino, an openly gay man, had skillfully put into screen every powerful exchange in the literature that finally gave light to that existential debate between Elio and Oliver:Call Me By Your Name IS NOT A GAY ROMANCE. It is a story of love not by two men but by two beings being vulnerable to each other who explored the boundaries of their beings being one in the search of infinity, the constant desire to be one organic whole. There's a huge reference to the works of Heidegger, **** M.C. Escher, and even Descartes, despite not being mentioned directly in the novel, when Elio mocked him and argued that the pineal gland isn't where the soul and body meet.So how did Aciman write it so well without being gay? Simple, aside from the fact that it isn't a gay novel as I argued, there's a plethora of literature about homosexual love that predates the contemporary notion of homosexuality (see Foucault's repressive hypothesis in History of Sexuality, 1976). History will tell you that there were no sexual labels prior to the rise of capitalism. Same-sex love existed in different parts of the world even before the East meets the Western world. The novel, I surmise, is Aciman's contemporary take on pederasty, noting the age gap between the two main characters and their academic status.Some critics see the lack of explicit sex scenes and frontal nudity as the downside of the film, that it is an implicit negotiation of the film with its straight audience and that it tolerates the homophobic resistance in cinema culture. Rather, I see it as an asset. Its current accolades could have been different, and even non-existent if not for that decision made by Guadagnino himself. It should be noted that the director revised its original screenplay which includes explicit scenes. At the end of the day, both the novel and the film are not about sex. It is about the passion between the two main characters who transcended their existential tension.No actor can perfectly fit Elio's precocious nature but Timothée Chalamet. When I first saw the trailer, I said to myself, \"they found the right guy.\" This guy, despite his very young age, will definitely win the most coveted awards this season. Armie Hammer, on the other hand, is the perfect support Chalamet can get. Their chemistry is one of the best on screen.",

The depth of the acting gives the work many layers such that all you want to do at the end is watch it again to better understand the hidden emotions. The surface characters are not sympathetic - Elio precociousness is matched by Oliver's arrogance but both are revealed to be outer protective layers covering inner vulnerability and the drama is the awkward revelation of mutual attraction. \"We wasted so much time\", Oliver says towards the end. Then much like Dr. Zhivago  and Lara live their limited time together to the full, so do Oliver and Elio. Their parting is silent appropriately enough at a train station where timetables are fixed and insensitive to the wight of the moment. Just when we think the end has come, Elio's father delivers the greatest father-son talk ever captured in cinema - which of us would not have wanted our father to articulate Mr. Perlman's generosity and love to them? - immediately trumped by one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever as the emotions cascade through Elios face in a single shot over almost 4 minutes.

So beautifully crafted in every way that it survives its near-fatal flaw. When Stanley Kubrick's Nabokov-based \"Lolita\" came out in 1962, it was advertised as the erotic adventure of a \"seductive\" teen who you too (men) would not be able to resist. Now in 2018, just as we're buttressing our  protections for children as well as adults from sexual exploitation, comes this romantic, exquisitely nuanced art, \"Call Me By Your Name\", that happens to repeat the horrible example of \"Lolita\". Seventeen year old Elio and his father's colleague, Oliver, fall in love. When Oliver leaves, both are heart-broken. Nearly every review I've read mentions \"coltish\" Elio's  intellectual maturity and emotional vulnerability. Remarkably, his cosmopolitan parents and social network are a model of insight, empathy, discretion, and support. They will help Elio turn his horrible loss into new strengths. The directing, cinematography, and acting that beautifully bring these nuances together is so effective that many viewers will suspend their boundary on man-boy sex.  In spite of our better judgement, some critics and many viewers become willing to believe a youth can seduce an adult; that the adult is not a culpable perpetrator.Technicalities of statutory rape aside, it's the developmental difference between a young Central Nervous System and a mature CNS that makes Oliver's relationship with Elio such a high risk for harm. We viewers and reviewers have a responsibility to remind the artists we rightly respect that romanticizing, even brilliantly, man-boy love contributes to sexual exploitation of anyone.  \"Lolita\" at its ending exposes the sexual exploitation of the teen as horrifically destructive. Frances McDormand says to her Priest in \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\", \"...you join the club, Father, you share responsibility\". As art is how the culture talks about itself, I believe she was talking to us about \"Call Me By Your Name\".Doug Pratt, Atlanta, Georgia, USA",

One of my problems was that the 25 year old and the 17 year old barely talked to each other before they decided they were in love, and this can ultimately be fine showing how a 25 year old like this would only be using the 17 year old for his own perverted reasons. But, they decide to make the characters fall in love and have sex with each other, which is an even worse problem. A 17 year old shouldn't be having this kind of relationship with a man, and the 17 year old's dad says that he's jealous of their relationship. And at the end the 25 year old gets married to another person and the 17 year old gets upset while they apparently still love each other.

Basically a story about nothing except a how 17 year old boy is attracted to a 20 something man.  The dialogue is boring and sadly, for Italy, there is little or no gorgeous scenery.  Spoiler alert.The young boy pissed me off by having intercourse with a young girl his age two times, then immediately dumps her to be with the boy he was attracted to in the first place.  I felt the parents of the boy were totally unrealistic as well.  Not one ounce of humor in the movie.  Good acting, but eh.",

This is basically the story of a 17 year old boy and an older male house guest of his parents who, together, bond in an intense romantic relationship. Filmed on location in Italy, this is a wonderful travelogue and visual description of the beautiful town in which all of the scenes take place and the outstanding cinemaphotography must be acknowledged. Unfortunately, that is where the depth and beauty of the picture ends. There is basically no story save the love the two lead characters find with each other and taking 2 hours and 12 minutes is too long a period of time to tell it. Against the tide of so many positive reviews, all of which I cannot understand, I give this film a 2.0 and suggest that many will find the film as boring and tedious as I did.",

I felt no real chemistry between Armie Hammer’s Oliver and Timothee Chalamet’s Elio. And that’s in spite of a wicked good performance from Chalemet, who is so completely open-hearted and vulnerable in this performance, if not technically perfect. Truly, one of the best performances I’ve seen by a young man ever. But it’s stranded in a film with a director who doesn’t know how to convey the passion between these two young men (or can’t, due to contractual obligations). I consistently felt that the camera was in the wrong place and that the pacing was wrong too. Somehow, this adaptation managed to feel boring and drawn out, while also rushing through all of the important moments. I don’t think Guadanigno really got into the head of his characters, particularly Chalamet, considering the book is really driven by the intensity of his wavering teenage emotions. It really just didn’t feel organic for me, which is too bad because I truly wanted to love this movie. Yet, I left feeling little emotion, with many of the film’s moments completely vanishing from my memory as I walked out of the theater. Even the film’s last scene, with a heart wrenching performance by Chalamet, seems more like an image I remember out of context than an emotion I feel in my heart.",

These guys didn't seem to have any connection that led them into the romance.

I was so tired of this movie by the time they finally got together. And when they did, I knew the story wasn't going to go anywhere...and of course it didn't.I'll give 2 points for the only good part of the film, the dialogue between dad and son at the end of the film.

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nI chose to see this film based upon Metacritic ratings and having seen Armie Hammer in Clint Eastwood's movie J. Edgar.  He was fantastic in that film, and the film itself was also quite good.  This new film however, is a phony. It's absolutely contrived and pretentious.  There's no love to be found in the relationship between the young Elio and Hammer.  And there's nothing believable about either character because they don't act or develop in any way -- we just see their breasts, body hair, etc., in close-up and listen to a lot of cheap, inauthentic pickup-bar talk from Hammer as he slowly tricks the boy.  Hammer's character \"Oliver\" is a fraud.The whole thing is no more than the story of a sexual predator manipulating a young boy, and a bunch of silly everything-else, none of which matters to the story.  The gutless Michael Stuhlbarg character (the boy's father) is used in the end to bookend a long, tiring and otherwise linear expose' to nowhere. What he says to his son is compassionate, I'll give it that, in a context-less way,  but is not enough to redeem the film or rationalize the abuse. And if in thinking about seeing this film the word Italy grabbed you, you've been conned.  Nothing Cinema Paradiso or Il Postino here.  It's a waste of Italy.  The boy's parents, their existence, incidental characters, the Italian landscape, are just prop pieces there to rationalize a vulgar, valueless story of abuse.  Who cares about the landscape if you're worried about a young boy in the hands of a predator.  My date and I grew uncomfortable with the extensive camera shots of the boy - his body parts, masturbation scenes, etc., which continued throughout the film.  At one point, he ejaculates into a peach (which he has used as a sex toy), and then Oliver comes and drinks the contents. We are then asked to interpret Elio's attempt to stop Oliver from doing this as Elio's desire for love and not mere use as a sex object by Oliver. This silly scene has been heralded by critics as monumental, cinematic progress, the finest scene in film, etc., but I think for most of us, it was where we lost hope for the boy, and for the film itself.  Perhaps the film is some kind of twisted meditation on lust versus love, and as to how the lust-predator person abuses the heart (and trust) of the love person. Certainly this is what transpires.  Maybe this is why the critics love it.  Or are the critics themselves lost in the twist themselves?  Abuse is abuse.  It is not love.  Lust, we all experience.  The audience is asked to view it all as a love story, but it is not.  Walking out to my car, my date fully disgusted, I recalled feelings from earlier in my life when I might have been less tolerant -- a consciousness, a remembrance of angry gays hell-bent on force-normalizing their rationalization of lust on people they insist upon offending.  A reaction, a step backwards for me personally to think in these terms, and I paid $26 for it.",

I’ve read nothing but ravesThis is a very hard review for me to write as I am a pushover, a sucker, an incurable romantic for love stories especially one that may be about a gay couple so I was looking forward to “Call Me by Your Name”. I’ve read nothing but raves about the film when in film festivals and it has been nominated for the Golden Globe and sure to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Film.The acting, as reported, is very good with a few minor quibbles but that mainly has to do with the story, the scenery in Northern Italy is at times breathtaking and at other times quiet, serene while the musical soundtrack at times can be jarring here and there.While there is good chemistry between Armie Hammer, playing 24-year-old Oliver, and Timothee Chalamet as 17-year-old Elio the much-needed passion that is written and hinted about isn’t there in the writing. The former has been hired as a summer intern to the latter’s father, an archaeology professor, Mr. Perlman played by Michael Stuhlbarg.While the main story is about Elio, a very well rounded educated, piano playing, multilingual youngster, coming of age that is experiencing sexual confusion, Oliver is the very handsome, sexy, sexual, amiable stranger who Elio is attracted to.The main failure of the movie, surprisingly enough, is James Ivory who has written and directed movies that showed sexiness and sex in more rounded, physical, explicit and meaningfulness, such as “Maurice”, than in the screenplay he has written for this film. To a certain extent he is aided and abetted by the director Luca Guadannino.In a 131 minute film there are, maybe, about 30 moving minutes, one that is funny involving a peach, another of Timothee Chalamant in a silent, moving, several minutes in length headshot and one startling, emotionally involving monologue by Michael Stuhlbarg along with maybe 30 minutes of scenery.“Call Me by Your Name” is rated R for some hinted at sex, some language and except for Stuhlbarg’s moving, brilliant monologue it was mainly a big disappointment to me.",

However, not all great gay movies contain an element of tragedy, just big Hollywood films... and this was definitely NOT a great gay movie. Poorly cast (Oliver is 24, Armie Hammer looks like he's in his mid-30's), no character development, zero sexual tension/romantic relationship development prior to the Elio's cock grab, no story, no balance... the first half of the movie fails to properly set up the second half (which i'm sure is quite beautiful on its own, as after an hour I thought 'this is utter **** and watched Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss instead).",

My only complaint is not really a complaint, it is just a sad fact:  the world in which these characters reside does not exist.  It would be lovely if it did.  But, alas it does not.

The location in Italy make it obvious, but the languid pacing is another hallmark of imports. The budding romance takes plenty of time to blossom. Timothée Chalamet plays a 17- year-old who lives with his family in an old villa. When an American doctoral student (Armie Hammer) visits for the summer, their initial indifference grows into desire. It develops slowly, but with a quiet sensuality. Chalamet has deservedly been getting lots of awards buzz because he captures the spontaneous enthuiasim of a teen, while revealing naive confusion and touching depth. Hammer also turns in a strong performance. The expressions of their love is tender and unafraid. Ultimately, it's a heartfelt, beautifully made story of a powerful emotional bond.",
