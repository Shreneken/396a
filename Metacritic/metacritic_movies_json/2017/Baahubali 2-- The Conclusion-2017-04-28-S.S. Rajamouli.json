        "It's loud, it's gory, and there are musical numbers. Behold, the first great summer film is here, and it's a three-hour-long action-adventure about a leader whose heroic deeds make Conan the Barbarian look like a wimp.",
        "This production\u2019s triumph is the room it\u2019s granted Rajamouli to head into the fields and dream up endlessly expressive ways to frame bodies in motion."

And when I say request, I mean really, a lot. I had seen the prequel in the theatre and had been waiting for this movie to come out ever since. It got delayed by a year. At first I was mad because the Baahubali: The Beginning said 2016 in the end, and the year was already going too bad. But finally it came in 2017, so I guess that makes it better.And just like Baahubali: The Beginning, this one also felt legendary. Not like a cheap sequel the way successful movies make, but an actual conclusion we had all been hoping for. The question as to why Katappa killed Baahubali was answered in the most spectacular way possible. We finally got to see how Baahubali met Devasena and why he was banished from Mahishmati. The action scenes were even better than the previous movie, and it concluded without any sequel baiting.I see why there are so many negative reviews over here. This movie can only be truly enjoyed in a theatre. It won't have the same impact when being watched on a TV or phone. It needs a huge audience to cheer, a perfect environment to be absorbed and the satisfaction we get after we spend a good amount of money to watch a movie.I am really hoping this saga has come to an end. They should not make more movies unless it is really necessary. We already have the perfect duology and having more than what we need will only ruin its image which we obviously don't wish to see. This movie deserves the same love as we give to all our ancient scriptures, because that is the vision which SS Rajamouli had while making this, and it's very much apparent when we watch this movie.",

Fantastic direction, Rana, Anushka , Tammanah and everybody did their best... but one disappointment that is Prabhas' acting.. I can easily give full marks but can't because:- Tbh,Prabhas must be more accurate enough (that's why he didn't get any award for film) .. Prabhas has no clarity in his speech while saying dialogue.. Improvement requires for Prabhas over here.. No promising acting level.. I also noticed in Bahubali 1 also.. Also except Prabhas, everything was nicely done.. jai SSR !!",
