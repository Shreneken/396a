  "critic_reviews": [
    "Writer-director Taylor Sheridan’s Wind River is a stark and beautiful and haunting 21st century Western thriller, filled with memorable visuals and poetic dialogue — and scenes of sudden, shocking, brutal violence.",
    "The focus here is always on character and storytelling and the acting that brings it all alive. With thrillers this good becoming a lost art, Wind River is definitely one to savor.",
    "An actor before he was a screenwriter, Mr. Sheridan clearly spent a lot of his time learning about filmmaking on movie sets; his direction is assured throughout.",
    "It does show us, in threads deftly woven, how circumstances can push hard against people, making everyday living a battle.",
    "Lambert’s three-dimensionality elevates Wind River above the norms of the traditional crime movie so that, in addition to delivering the expected tropes, it provides a richer, more fulfilling experience.",
    "[Renner] and Sheridan and some terrific, under-used supporting players...give Wind River a somber, grim grace and the relentless forward motion of a thriller.",
    "You have undoubtedly seen many films that cover, generally, about the same territory as Taylor Sheridan’s Wind River.... But you probably haven’t seen one quite like “Wind River,” a movie less interested in examining the crime than in uncovering the icicle of grief at its core.",
    "It’s one terrific, offbeat and heart-pounding thriller set in the frozen wilderness of a Wyoming Indian reservation that never ceases to surprise, enthrall and pump the adrenaline with an energy that stuns.",
    "With its chilly, atmospheric and convincing story, Wind River has the feel of a richly immersive novel. It’s not perfect.... But the mood is tense, the characters are well-drawn and director-screenwriter Taylor Sheridan has crafted some of the best dialogue of any movie this year.",
    "Renner, in one of his best roles, lends a weathered depth to Cory but also surprising intelligence to the character deemed “Sherlock Snow.”",
    "On the surface a tense investigative piece with Renner as a regular Sherlock of the snow, it also slips in cogent and damning points about the limitations and dead ends virtually forced on many residents of Native American reservations.",
    "For all its well-worn outlines, the narrative exerts its own fierce, clenched-jaw grip: a cautionary campfire tale that reminds us it’s not merely the end that matters, it’s the style and skill of the telling.",
    "Sheridan pares his story and characters down to their barest essentials, making a movie that comes off sometimes as slight, but which ultimately delivers the goods for those who like smart takes on life-or-death macho adventure.",
    "Sheridan is emerging as a master of the Mexican standoff, the shootout, the stomach-turning crime scene, the procedural office politics, but he’s also adept at tuning into the vulnerability and strength of the women and men called in to uphold the law. Wind River is a smart and very satisfying movie.",
    "Sheridan directs as well as writes for the first time, and delivers a superb thriller with a powerful chill that gets in your bones. Smart, tense and soulful.",
    "As with all of the films he writes, Sheridan takes us to places that are foreign to many of us, yet immerses us so deeply into the sense of place that everything feels familiar, recognizable. It’s a trip worth taking, making “Wind River” another stop on the unique cinematic travelogue Sheridan is building.",
    "Sheridan can’t quite shake a hint of Silence of the Lambs–esque familiarity, but that’s a wonderful standard to be reaching for. More to his credit, he fills his thriller with sharp observations among his Native American characters (not merely paid lip service), as well as the sudden crack of gunfire. You learn to look for tracks and clues; it’s a film that makes you a better viewer.",
    "Although the resolution to the mystery wouldn’t do credit to a third-rate thriller, it’s crazily powerful — sudden and bloody but with no real catharsis, just a sense of waste and a feeling of, “What now?” I’m not sure how Sheridan would answer that — not that an artist really needs to.",
    "Wind River confirms the director as a rising talent who can be trusted to beat his own enticing path through inhospitable ground.",
    "The film yanks the viewer to attention with its keen sensitivity to the rough winter conditions and limited prospects faced by the locals. It also features one of Jeremy Renner’s best recent performances, but does fall into some traps when it ventures into Tarantino and Peckinpah territory.",
    "Wind River can be thrilling and it owns the ability to surprise and shock throughout.",
    "The movie's strength is Sheridan's knack for vivid characterization through little more than casual remarks and consistent voices.",
    "Sheridan knows how to craft a tidy whodunit – and a late-act switch in perspective works better than it should – but he eventually leans toward sermonizing instead of storytelling, a well-intentioned move that edges the story just this close to melodrama.",
    "An impressive effort and an impressive result that opens up a world that most of us have never thought about and renders it with sorrow and vividness.",
    "All three actors are excellent. So’s Gil Birmingham, as the victim’s father.",
    "Sheridan drops us in and we know this place immediately; his storytelling is meaty but efficient, and his pacing moves along at a steadily engrossing clip before ultimately exploding in a startling blast of violence.",
    "Yes, his direction hits a few tonal bumps; he could have been tougher on his screenwriter on tightening the plot twists. No matter. Wind River packs an elemental power that knocks you for a loop.",
    "Wind River may not blow you away, but this bitter, visceral, and almost parodically intense thriller knows what it takes to survive.",
    "The storytelling doesn’t measure up to the spectacular scenery; at several points the narrative veers sharply off-course into Tarantino-tinged violence, some of it patently silly. But the generally somber tone is interesting, the performances are involving.",
    "Sheridan’s feel for psychology and setting are in fine evidence here. Wind River’s landscapes are forbidding and beautiful.",
    "Wind River adds up, and skillfully, but in the end it’s not all that exciting. It’s a vision of the new American despair — not an inner-city movie, but an inner-wilderness movie — and it could have used another twist or two.",
    "Sheridan’s screenplay, despite some very nice touches and his typically laconic dialogue, is the weakest of his recent trilogy in terms of building tension and mystery. Nevertheless, it succeeds well enough on its own terms.",
    "Driven by another of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis’ murmuring folk soundtracks, Wind River turns out to be the weakest of Sheridan’s loose trilogy — the one with the thinnest characterizations and the toughest time disguising its subtext as plainspoken townsfolk rapport.",
    "It’s here that Sheridan’s genre instincts get the best of him, and Wind River gives way to lurid exploitation.",
    "Although Sheridan has approached the setting with the sensitivity and respect of his deeply empathic protagonist, the film still bears a slight but inescapable whiff of cultural tourism.",
    "Taylor Sheridan’s flair for creating heartland epics is undimmed, but it’s hard not to wonder what someone with more directing chops, and the will to hit the accelerator, would have done with it.",
    "While there’s no reason to crack a lot of jokes to lighten the mood, it can start to feel like the movie relies too heavily on despair, to the point of capitalizing on its characters’ suffering — and, given the realism of Sheridan’s films, the suffering of people like them.",
    "Though it can't bear too much comparison with Sicario, Wind River is far better than its title suggests and a promising directorial debut.",
    "The film is gracefully directed around the edges, but the core story, a kind of existential murder mystery, is swallowed up by a series of increasingly outlandish plot devices involving drug runners and Tarantino-esque shootouts.",
    "Let down by muddy characterization and a choppy directorial style, the drama finally coheres in its final act to deliver the uncompromising thrills that have been Sheridan’s trademark.",
    "Wind River is also a potent example of how form isn’t always enough when the story is as frequently unnerving for unintentional reasons as it is for the horrors it aims to present.",
    "Wind River is roughly 50 percent strengths, 50 percent contrivances. Often they collide in the same scene.",
    "The crime story, involving the hunt for the men who murdered this girl, is strictly by-the-numbers (and there are a few clue that still don’t fit together in my mind) but Sheridan proves himself a surprisingly effective director of action.",
    "When Taylor Sheridan is left to his own devices, his work seems more abrupt and shallow, no more so than when he resolves all of this film's lingering questions in one unremittingly nasty sideswipe of a flashback."

It has a slow start followed by an engaging middle part but it definitely drops the ball at the end. I liked Elizabeth Olsen as the out of her depthI found Wind River well done thriller with some nice acting, visuals and emotional moments. It has a slow start followed by an engaging middle part but it definitely drops the ball at the end. I liked Elizabeth Olsen as the out of her depth FBI officer who does her best. Jeremy Renner is also good but seems to lack screen presence. The rest of the cast give a good performance. Overall a decent movie with a good cast but marred by a poor ending and script that doesn't always work well.I will only make a few observations about the weak parts of the movie.Jeremy Renner?Given that the movie is set in an Indian Reservation I found it curious that this role was not given to a native or that there is hardly anything done with the fact that Renner is a white man living among Indians. Specifically because an important theme throughout the movie is that life in an Indian reservation is hard and the natives are treated as second rank citizens. It is one time alluded to that Renner isn't one of them, but most of the movie sees him treated as one of them. In addition Renner is actually a hunter of dangerous wildlife. It almost feels like this should have been played by native but that the studio probably didn't have the balls to cast one as the lead.Renner's additional problem is that he seems to have a weak screen presence in this movie and he is at his best alone. Perhaps this is actually well played.  The problems it that the moment someone else steps into the frame the camera seems to turn away from him, like happens with Graham Greene(the chief of police), Olsen and even his ex wife played by Julia Jones. I am still not certain if that is well done or just his issue.Those infernal pumas.An important part in the movies is played by the elusive pumas. It is searching for them that makes Renner find the first body and lateron he finds via them an important clue about the murder. The confrontation between Renner and the pumas seems inevitable, and I was expecting that this would lead to some kind of payoff near the end. However, nothing is done. In fact it isn't even shown that he kills these predators in the end after he has found them, which feels like someone didn't had the nerve to have them killed and not even have it suggested by having some shots fired?Dropping the ball...This movie is a thriller set in a cold landscape giving you this eerie forlorn feel sometimes changed into beautiful visuals. This contradiction of the deadly blizzards and stunning beautiful landscapes is an important aspect of the movie. It is mirrored in the movie for the people: Renner's happy family before his daughter was killed and his breakup with his wife after. Much of this is alluded to(and might have been even more profound with a better director and script)...then the end happens. The end is a sudden change of pace. Perhaps because this contrasts with the first three quarters of the movie just like a blizzard follows a beautiful wintry landscape. However it feels like they suddenly decided to take a sharp turn and step into another genre. I leave it at this, as to not spoil your fun, but I felt that the ending was not well executed, especially because they just show you what happened scene by scene during the murder. It spoils the thriller/mystery aspect. Like really, was that needed? Like really, can't you solve a case without knowing that you got it right?",

This is one of those movies that punches you in the gut and never lets you back up even after it's over. It's so powerful that I watched it with my best friend and we normally talk through a whole movie while we are at home but we sat in silence, completely gripped by this movie. Jeremy Renner is fantastic, and this movie proved to me that Elizabeth Olsen is a powerhouse actress that is not fairly represented by her role as Scarlet Witch in the MCU.

I even enjoyed the flashback they threw in to give us the backstory on the crime. It was also a nice little surprise visit from Jon Bernthal. The characters were very well-written and each one was emotionally complex. In addition, that ending was incredibly satisfying. 8/10Performances: The acting is all wonderful, whether it be from the central cast or the supporting. It was beautiful watching the hospital scene and seeing Elizabeth Olsen break down, very similar to the medic scene from Captain Philips. I only saw one problem with the acting and it came from an extra. When Natalie's dead body is lying on the examination table, the actress playing the dead body is seen breathing through the diaphragm. It's small but noticeable. 8/10Cinematography (Ben Richardson): The cinematography is outstanding in this film and goes the extra mile to show off the beautiful scenery of the snow-covered mountains. Absolutely flawless on the part of Richardson. 10/10Editing (Gary Roach): I was surprised to see how great the editing was, especially during some parts where I can imagine it was challenging. The moment of the pepper spray raid was well-edited, as well as the flashback. 10/10Visual Effects: The VFX were well-done and seamless from the practical effects. From the blood running down characters' faces to the look of frostbite to the dead animals. It all looked stunning and is exactly how filmmakers should apply VFX. 10/10Enjoyment: 'Wind River' is a very exciting film that constantly has the audience's attention and curiosity. It even goes the extra mile to make sure it satisfies the viewer with an incredible ending and a connection to the real world we live in. 8/10Musical Score (Nick Cave/Warren Ellis): Cave and Ellis bring it again with a beautiful score after their excellent job on 'Hell or High Water'. The soundtrack is very similar to that soundtrack but supplies some different tracks that help convey the freezing cold of this setting. 9/10Sound Mixing: The sound mixing is very well-done in this flick as we're given a lot of ambiance through the sound alone. Even the gunshots are well done, minus the fact that some of the sound effects they used for the gunshots were ones used in many movies before. However, that was not distracting enough to be a problem. 9/10Production Design (Neil Spisak): The scenes were well-designed from the cabins and trailers to the yards they reside in. Even the natural settings are beautifully crafted. 10/10Overall: 'Wind River' is another excellent film by Taylor Sheridan after my personal favorite of his 'Hell or High Water.' The film is mysterious and jaw-dropping while also opening our eyes to travesties done toward Native American people. 9/10",

But, what sets \"Wind River\" apart from both \"Sicario\" and \"Hell Or High Water\" - aside from the fact that this one features Sheridan himself in the director's chair - is just how staggering the message is this time around. True, the statements on the drug war and the housing/financial crisis made for interesting thematic fodder, but I think \"Wind River\" speaks to a topic that has unfortunately gone far less discussed: life on the Native American reservation. Couple these hauntingly illustrated truths with some brilliant performance work from both Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, and you end up with one of the year's most underrated films.",

      "content": "Taylor Sheridan is the mastermind writer behind Denis Villeneuve’s “Sicario” (2015) and David Mackenzie’s “Hell or High Water” (2016), in which he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Although no continuity, “Wind River”Taylor Sheridan is the mastermind writer behind Denis Villeneuve’s “Sicario” (2015) and David Mackenzie’s “Hell or High Water” (2016), in which he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Although no continuity, “Wind River” acts as the final chapter in Sheridan’s neo-western frontier trilogy, once again romanticising his passion for western tropes and the gun slinging violence of that era. Western feel aside, Texas-born Sheridan’s previous scripts were topical that provoked thought, discussion and insight into various issues. Wind River is no different. “Sicario” tackled the US war on Mexican drug cartels, trafficking and ambiguity of law enforcement methods and jurisdiction, whilst “Hell or High Water” highlighted the economic plight of West Texas, the US housing crisis and predatory practices of financial institutions. Wind River focuses on American social issues such as the marginalisation of Native Americans, impoverishment, substance abuse and cultural ignorance.This crime thriller mystery opens with a barefoot teenage girl sprinting desperately across a moon soaked snow covered open plain, until she collapses with exhaustion, ultimately crawling to her death. The next day she is discovered by Cory Lambert, a Wyoming tracker played by Jeremy Renner, who immediately recognises her as a friend of his teenage daughter. With the death of the Native American girl occurring on the Wind River Native American Reservation, tribal police become involved, headed by its straight faced chief played by Graham Greene. The death also captures the attention of the FBI and they send their “closest” agent from Las Vegas to help investigate. Elizabeth Olsen joins Renner, her Avengers co-star, playing inexperienced FBI agent Jane Banner. Her girl like demeanor, lack of preparation for the harsh climate and cultural ignorance all brilliantly add to her fish out of water character and the reservations isolation from the outside world. Her character traits remind me of Jodie Foster’s Clarice Starling from The Silence of the Lambs.Banner and Lambert combine to try and solve the mysterious circumstances of Natalie’s death with Lambert motivated by a past family tragedy. The relationship between Banner and Lambert is handled impressively as they both leverage each other’s skill set to move forward with the investigation. Despite her inexperience, Banner is still presented as a strong, equipped female lead, much like Sheridan wrote for Emily Blunt’s character in Sicario. Sheridan also avoids the temptation of making the two love interests, which would have been clichéd and made zero sense in the context of the story and each characters arc, instead establishing more of a mutual respect mentor relationship. Story wise, the rest of the film plays out as your typical police investigation slow burn until a violently intense climax lifted straight from the page of a Tarantino movie. It’s a climax that pays off, especially with an important scene that swerves the story from its seemingly conventional delivery that caught me off guard and was quite impressive and cleverly implemented.This is easily one of Jeremy Renner’s best performances.  It was a refreshing change that steered away from the emotionless brooding failure of Aaron Cross or light-hearted comic relief of a charter from the MCU. Lambert has personal demons that motivate him to help assist the investigation and although stoic for most parts, he has moments that scratch the surface of the heartbreak bubbling underneath. Renner’s best scenes come with Natalie’s grieving father Martin, played by the fantastic Gil Birmingham, also from Hell or High Water,  who acts as a link for the socio-economic problems faced on the reservation. The cinematography captures the landscape perfectly, with some great high shots that emphasize the harsh environment during snow storms and picturesque mountains during the day.Although she was flawless and matched Renner in performance and presence, Elizabeth Olsen’s character had very little back story or motivation other than being an FBI agent stationed in Las Vegas. Sheridan’s character driven scripts usually leave no stone un-turned and whilst it didn’t deter from the movie, it may have been a missed opportunity to strengthen FBI agent Banner’s impact.The symbolism portrayed in the opening scene with Jeremy Renner acting as protector by sniping off a pack of wolves preying on a pack of weak defenceless goats sets the tone for the films narrative. Survival and protection from predators. Sheridan’s directorial debut and third original screenplay Wind River is equal parts impressive and hauntingly dark. Suffering from comic book hero fatigue? With some surprising cameos, an amazing cast and a character driven script, Wind River is a must for fans of original screenplays and contemporary crime thrillers with a western edge.",

There’s a bunch of smaller characters around but it’s very much about them two, or rather the tracker guy alone.If you have seen (among others) „Winter’s Bone“, „A Single Shot“, „Justified“ or any other story of this type, you can already guess what you’re in for.I would compare „Wind River“ mostly to 2013’s „A Single Shot“ starring Sam Rockwell, this being mostly about one unlikely male hero who has to take matters into his own hands, with a little exciting violence in the end. And both are also about mental and physical isolation, and solving stuff alone.Having written that, an early Nolan work „Insomnia“ also sprung to mind for comparision, which was my favorite Nolan until the mighty „Dunkirk“ arrived.The movie’s mostly about building – characters, their state of mind, sense of place, mood, suspense.The aim is not to dispense fast pleasures or easily digestible entertainment, and there’s no need for that, because once you are able to invest yourself in the story, you’ll probably agree that screenwriter and debuting director Taylor Sheridan is very able to pull it all off.Everybody's not gonna be happy about how they have built up the explosive finale, but I liked it. No problems with that kind of approach, at least in this case.Acting is very good all around, with delicate, nuanceful, and well measured performances from everybody from the central hero to the smallest characters on-screen.„Wind River“ is a cool directorial debut from Taylor Sheridan, who has previously acted in TV but also written screenplays for „Sicario“ and „Hell or High Water“, both unfortunately unwatched by me (and most others) so far. But both have received encouraging word of mouth, and „Wind River“ makes me want to see these even more.It’s a good TV series quality drama, which is highest honor an American movie can receive in 2017. Bleak and depressing but ultimately satisfying stuff.",

Wind River stars Jeremy Renner as verteran game tracker, Cory Lambert, who discovers the remains of a young Native American woman while hunting on the Native American Reservation in the mountains of Wyoming. Which then lead to the murder investigation lead by FBI agent Jane Banner played by Elizabeth Olson. Learning that she is out of her element, Banner recruits the helps the help of Lambert to track down the murderers.Taylor really showed his skills as a very talented and solid director with Wind River, from the opening scene it was captivating and intense, leading to a strong roller coaster of emotion and drama. I was blown away by this movie and it's intelligent story telling and it's captivating performances, as wells as the truly beautiful look of this movie.Let's take a look at the best things about this film.1. Tone- The tone of this movie is really something that is known immediately, and Taylor Sheridan didn't back down from it. He used everything in his wheelhouse, including the environment, to create a very dark  and very sinister tone. The realism of this movie is scary and very gripping throughout. It didn't feel like a movie, it felt small and real. I felt like I was going along with these characters attempting to solve this horrific murder along side them.2. Acting- The acting in this movie was something that was truly amazing. Jeremy Renner gave hands down his best performance. Renner truly carried this movie with what I believe to be a truly oscar worthy role. Elizabeth Olson also had the role of her carrier in Wind River. I didn't see either of these characters as \"actors\" I saw them as the characters they were portraying and I felt like they had lives outside of the movie we were watching. The back story to Cory Lambert was so heartfelt and real I felt like I lived it with him. 3. Script- This movie had some of the best conversational scene I have seen in a long time. The dialogue in this movie was masterfully crafted. Nothing felt out of place and all of the dialogue felt like natural everyday conversation. The scene in which Cory tells Jane about his tragic past was one of the most captivating scenes I have scene in a while. Every part of this script just felt well crafted and put together.4. Entertaining- Wind River had a lot of entertainment value to it. It was one of the best murder mysteries I have seen. After Sheridan's Hell or High Water, I was expectant of a pretty good crime thriller. Wind River to me, was more entertaining. Every scene had me sitting closer to the screen and I was sitting on the edge of my seat by the end of it. It also had to really surprising and exciting action scenes.5. Ending- Taylor Sheridan did an amazing job of making this movie have one of the best endings I have seen in a long time. It was satisfying on a really big level. It didn't end in a conventional way, but the ending was cathartic in a lot of ways. The climax of this movie was almost sickening and was very hard to watch. Jeremy Renner really helped sell the ending of this movie in a big way.Overall, Wind River was one of the best movies I have seen this year. From the very beginning of this movie I knew it was going to be something extremely special. Wind River was an excellent movie and very entertaining. Jeremey Renner and Elizabeth Olson both gave the performances of their careers. I highly recommend seeing Wind River. I am going to give Wind River an A.",

Written and directed by the guy who wrote Hell or High Water, which is also a fantastic movie (as well as Sicario, which I am not as high on). Lots of layers, a fresh narrative structure, and loads of great acting. At the very least, it would be nice to see Gil Birmingham get an Oscar nod for supporting actor.This is a movie that trusts the intelligence of the viewer, which means we can take a few perfectly-chosen words and imply paragraphs of emotion and exposition. For example, on the destruction of Native American culture:-Jeremy Renner: “What’s with the paint?”-Gil Birmingham: “This is my death face”-JR: “And how do you know what that is?”-GB: “I don’t. I just made it up. It’s not like there’s anyone around to teach me.”That’s it. No explanation, no further dialog, no righteous lectures. And with that, we know that a father can’t properly mourn his daughter because even that piece of culture been taken from him, along with everything else.Jeremy Renner also excels in a role which seemed made for his toughness and deliberate pacing.  He might even have reached Gus McCrae-level frontier righteousness, which isn’t an easy thing to do.Finally, the entire movie oozes respect for its subject and makes a compelling point without stooping to, as Mr. Birmingham has said in interviews, \"poverty porn.\"An all-around good film, and definitely in my top 5 for this year.",

While just his second directorial effort, Sheridan's voice was brought to life in both Sicario and Hell or High Water to the point that itFew writers have been in a better position to express their voice so clearly than Taylor Sheridan. While just his second directorial effort, Sheridan's voice was brought to life in both Sicario and Hell or High Water to the point that it feels as though both were directed by him. However, in seeing Wind River, the first film he wrote and directed (his debut Vile was just directed by him), it is clear that he does benefit from working with better directors. While Sheridan capably directs the film's strong script, it remains true that in the hands of somebody better, Wind River could have been a classic. As it stands, it is instead a pretty good film with great ideas on its mind that it handles far too bluntly at times. A thrilling and sorrowful film about a murder on an Indian reservation, Wind River works, but not to the degree that it should have, leaving it as a good but disappointing work.In both Sicario and Hell or High Water, it became clear that Sheridan's thematic focus was upon the disenfranchised. In the former, he focused on those living under the thumb of the Cartel in both Mexico and across the border in America. In the latter, he focused upon those left behind in the dust by the financial collapse in the late 2000s. Now, in Wind River, he turns his focus on a group of people all Americans have contributed to the demise of: Native Americans. With a Native American girl, Natalie Hanson (Kelsey Chow), found dead on the reservation by wild life and game tracker Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner), the murder serves as merely a gateway into the life on the reservation. For FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), this functions as if it were another world. Completely isolated and on their own without back-up, the tribal police run by Ben (Graham Greene), operates across a territory the size of Rhode Island with just six officers. With such little police presence, no opportunity for advancement via education or jobs, and readily available drugs and alcohol, the Wind River Indian Reservation is the quintessential depiction of life for Natives in America right now. With missing Native girls reaching astronomical figures, alcoholism running rampant, and drug use throughout, Wind River calls attention to the issues facing Natives in a searing, depressing, and realistic depiction. When handling these issues, Sheridan does so beautifully and skillfully, burying them within average conversations between Cory and men believed to be somewhat connected to the murder. In every home on the reservation, demons reside and it is best to pretend that they are not actually there.Found six miles from the nearest building, Sheridan's ability to use the death of Natalie as a metaphor and symbolism for the life of Natives is perhaps the film's most impressive aspect. Dying not from being raped or killed, but from having her lungs explode due to the cold weather, Sheridan subtly and smartly depicts how the land has even turned against Natives after all these years. Through the turmoil and strife thrust upon them by the whites and their arrival in the Americas, Natives could always count on the lands to sustain them in their time of need. However, with such little territory and animals such as the bison leaving Indian reservations, the staples of Native American life have left them in the lurch to the point that they have nothing to do and are without hope. What were once proud people have been left destitute through their interactions with whites and through the changing of times as crops die and animals leave. While whites led them to their grave with a gun to their head, the land is truly what nailed the final nail in the coffin of Natives in America with the land no longer being sustainable. However, while the situation is hopeless and destitute - just as the one faced by Natalie with her having to run six miles barefoot just to get where she was, which was nowhere - this race of people that have been in the Americas for thousands of years refuse to give up and will fight until their dying breathe.Sheridan, in the course of depicting how the land and circumstance is truly what is killing Native Americans, refuses to let whites off the hook. At the end of the day, the only reason Natives are in this situation to begin with because of whites. It is a central argument in the film that it is impossible to define. With the case of Natalie, she was clearly led to run in the snow by some malevolent force that is certainly guilty of homicide. However, the coroner cannot give the cause of death as homicide, as she died because of her lungs exploding. While it is true that it should be considered a homicide, that is not her cause of death. Though it may be true that the land turning against Natives has only worsened conditions on reservations, the only reason they are there to begin is whites, so how can the blame not be laid at the feet of whites across America who deny culpability in the matter?",

Every aspect about its presentation that is good is complemented by an aspect of its presentation that is bad. Ultimately, it's just unremarkable, and kind of bland.

About a rookie FBI agent and big game hunter uncovering the mystery of a young woman who was raped and murdered and left in the snow. The synopsis of the movie may sound like it’s another ‘murder mystery’ type movie but this isn’t the case with in depth characters and an intriguing yet simple storyline with some twists that no one can even expect to happen makes this movie worth the viewing. Sheridan taking his first steps on becoming one of the greats with writing has come out and done his first directing job and nailed it perfectly. With some of the lingering shots on objects and scenes to the intense fight scenes that break out randomly to the monologues that are given throughout make chills go down just about anybody's spines. Acting wise it was flawless all around. Renner is unrecognizable as Cory with his chilling past and his ice cold straight face he keeps throughout is mesmerizing. Olsen as Banner is also amazing with them both working on Avengers and Civil War together to this, their on screen chemistry pours out with these A list actors. Even minor roles like Jon Bernthal and Kelsey Chow were great and even Gil Birmingham as the father of the murdered girl is incredible with his straight face in some scenes and others of him breaking down to nothing from the incident that has happened. The pacing of this story is amazing with a balance of strong, interesting drama to some brutal scenes of action that end unexpectedly in twists of huge proportions. My favorite  had to be the scenes between Renner and Olsen, and Olsen and Greene when they shared them because they were powerful, sometimes comical in the right points, and all around just moving with morals and differences with their different viewpoints and drives they have for this film. With the minor special effects used in it. It shocks you when it does with it seamlessly being brought into these brutal action scenes that were so satisfying on the first viewing of it. With a flawless and simple story powered by great actors and a head strong director with great action and scene building. There isn’t a flaw to this film at all.",

I totally recommend it, if you like stories like this, you will definitively enjoy it, but even so if not the case, for any movie lover this one is a very good option.",

Nonetheless, it's still quite a solid, yet a bit more slow burn of a film that maintains the same tense and unpredictable atmosphere. Just as he did with 'Sicario' and 'Hell or High Water', Sheridan brilliantly crafts a screenplay with a gritty and absorbing story and characters, but in addition, this time he even gets in the director's chair for the first time in this one, truly proving his worth and talent as not just a superb storyteller, but filmmaker as well. Rounded out with strong performances from Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, and you've got a great thriller with quite a dark, yet compelling story to tell. Overall, like I said before, my only gripe with this one is that it ended up being a bit more subtle and slow burn than I expected, especially compared to 'Sicario' and 'Hell or High Water', but it's still well worth anyone's time who enjoyed those two films or are simply just looking for an all-around great and often times tense film.",

The FBI lady was totally miscast and unbelievable in her role.  The violence was pointless and at times borderline ridiculous. And the overall story, which held the possibility of an insightful look into contemporary native culture, instead only pandered to cheap cliches and stereotypes of both natives and the evil \"white man.\" The fact that critics are raving about how great this movie was, is a testament to the continual lowering of Western artistic standards.",

The film starts off well with the beautiful view, of a frozen terrain, on a Native American Reservation.  Unfortunately for Sheridan, it's all downhill from there.   His script and his two leads, are about as misguided as the competence level of FBI agent Jane Banner, played by Olsen, in what is arguably, one of the worst performances of her young career. Now let's move on to Renner, who plays Corey Lambert, a games tracker on the Wind River Reservation, the man who first discovers the dead body, of a young female, by the name of Natalie. When Renner isn't spewing, ridiculous, self-centered monologues, about pain and suffering, he's upping the masculine superiority within Sheridan's script, by outshining Jane Banner and even the local police officers, in their hunt to bring Natalie's family justice.Sheridan's directorial debut is a missable one and to put it simply, an overrated spectacle, with a screenplay that is awkwardly paced, filled with over the top violence, weak dialogue, and two leads, who have forgotten how to act, during their time in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Instead of his usual top notch suspense, Sheridan settles for cheap thrills and obvious conclusions.",

From that opening, it is as if the violence never ends with wolves being killed, lions killing animals, men killing men, the leading man's (Jeremy Renner), daughter, a friend of the dead girl, having been murdered like that girl, a girl being gang-raped, everyone both good and bad being hunters and hunted with the members of the audience being put through a lot, too much, pain.Ther screenplay by Taylor Sheridan who also directed the film is all over the place in both departments while the score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis adds tension and helps one feel the cold and snow in the excellent cinematography.The cast starting with Jeremy Renner as a trapper and Elizabeth Olsen as an FBI rookie who realizes she can learn a lot from the trapper along with Gil Birmingham and Tantoo Cardinal as the dead girl's parents with her being played by Kelsey Asbille in a flashback along with Jon Bernthal as her older boyfriend, Julia Jones as the trapper's ex-wife, Tio Briones as their son all do fine jobs though, either through the soundtrack, mumbling or whispers many points of the story are lost.As bad as the violence is the role played by James Jordan is so appalling bad one has to wonder if the director hoped the audience would laugh at it to get the bad taste of rapes, murders and bodily destruction out of their heads as they left the auditorium.\"Wind River\" is based on a true story and at the end credits there are some comments that I felt had very little to do with the story we had seen.Unless you are a lover of human and animal violence I do not recommend \"Wind River\".",

The unlikely circumstances with terrible stereotypes... but some of the lines stick with you and it might have been a great movie about a serious issue but the movie lacked finesse and was rough all over.

It received glowing reviews and even got a 8 minutes standing at Cannes. Sometimes I question if a movie with this much praise behind it can live up to your expectations you set yourself for. I think it did.This is one chilling and haunting movie. By the end you feel drained and in a deep state of reflection from your experience.With the stunning cinematography, terrifying score, fully developed characters, and Taylor Sheridan brilliant direction made the overall atmosphere a cold blizzard. That ends so satisfying.Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen, and Graham Greeneis are absolutely outstanding in this. Not a weak performance in sight, from everyone else. I'm surprised there's no award talk about Renner and Greeneis during this Oscar season. Renner playing the tough, but broken bad-ass with a painful history was compelling to watch.Not as great like 'Sicario' and 'Hell or High Water', but still a strong directed movie from Taylor Sheridan.Overall rating: The alternate version of 'The Snowman', just more Western.",

And it's so obvious how ideas which Wind River fails to express unfold in Yellowstone. Film looks like a bad compromise between scenarist and producer. Many stories started left abandoned and unfinished. See some examples: story hints some specific problems of native americans but it is not clear what really troubles them, or it's all about living in the middle of nowhere no matter of skin color. The main guy Cory Lambert hunts pumas thought the story and finally finds the lair, but does not kill the cubs, noticing trails on snow and being distracted... so what? Will he kill them later does it have ant matter for him? There is no answer. Was it just cut from the screenplay? Why security personnel from drilling camp decide to offend the officials? They aren't drunk any more, don't anyone realize that they haven't got a single chance to escape responsibility? So follows scene of shooting in Tarantino's style... but it is not Tarantino and scene looks artificial, alien and irrational. Was is in original scenario? And what about relations of Cory and his son? Looks like he took him to reservation and left till the end of film, you can just can completely cut all scenes with son from first half of story, and it will change nothing. Why would you start story which you are not going to finish? And what about Jane Banner, ok at first she is portrayed like young unexperienced but highly responsible FBI agent. Finally Cory saves her from death and tells many compliments in hospital. But what was this experience for her? Have is changed her life, her points of view, her character? Not even a hint. Later Taylor Sheridan was finally able to express his ideas in the Yellowstone, but in the Wind River he completely failed.",

We’ll I did the same to address not his zero but anyone on any platform ( IMDB, SLANT, ROTTEN TOMATOES ( notice it’s already assumed it’s ROTTEN.)Here’s my brief critique of the bad reviews of Wind River: 1) critics -Have you ever made a feature film?2) Have you ever been any part of a crew shooting in roughed terrain, snow cold , wide open spaces or all of the above with all night shots?- been involved in casting the actors’ ? Working w their schedules, scouted locations  (3) Have you ever drawn up a film budget, secured financing finished a film went through post production, film festivals, sold a feature film, or DELIVERED a film for Domestic and Foreign territories? It’s rhetorical but before you take out your knives to pan ANY movie doing some of the above will make you a better film reviewer. Snd before I go , what experience does it take to be a movie critic? Going to movies? We’ll, we’ve all done that. So the anis nothing. Absolutely nothing. DCR",
