    "summary": "When a rich woman's ex-husband (Cary Grant) and a tabloid-type reporter (James Stewart) turn up just before her planned remarriage, she (Katherine Hepburn) begins to learn the truth about herself.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Utterly beguiling, funny and romantic.",
        "Add Hepburn\u2019s persona, beautifully explored here in all its wonder, and Stewart\u2019s likeability, and George Cukor\u2019s sensible, subtle, and lovingly unrushed direction of a firecracker script\u2026the result is a studio picture far deeper and richer than its whimsical surface style might lead you to believe.",
        "Mercifully, The Philadelphia Story then transmogrifies into one of the smartest, sassiest - and sexiest - movies ever.",
        "Provided you have a little patience for the lavishly rich, which these folks are, you should have great fun at The Philadelphia Story. For Metro and Director George Cukor have graciously made it apparent, in the words of a character, that one of the \"prettiest sights in this pretty world is the privileged classes enjoying their privileges.\" And so, in this instance, you will too.",
        "A delight from start to finish, with everyone involved working on peak form.",
        "The film is a Hepburn triumph, and moviegoers who resent the theatre's habit of requisitioning their stars may feel that Miss Hepburn's time on the stage has not been spent in vain and that she simply prepared herself for this achievement during the long run of the play.",
        "The result of all this high-priced maladjustment is terribly funny, terribly upper class. No one could have written it better than Plahywright Barry, who has written it often (\"Holiday,\" \"The Animal Kingdom,\" et al.)...It's a good, entertaining show.",
        "Excellent casting, a great storyline and a shrp script mean that this remains a classic of the genre and one of Katherine Hepburn's best roles.",
        "A picture every suburban mamma and poppa must see\u2013after Junior and little Elsie Dinsmore are tucked away.",
        "With such a stellar cast, a fine director working in the type of picture he did best, and some genuinely witty dialogue, this film has all the ingredients for a great comedy. And it is great, though there have been many funnier comedies. The film has an unfortunate tendency to take itself too seriously for long stretches."
