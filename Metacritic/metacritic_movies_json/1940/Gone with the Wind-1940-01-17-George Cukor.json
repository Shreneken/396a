  "summary": "A Southern belle struggles with the devastation of the Civil War and Reconstruction. This classic won 8 Academy Awards, including Best Picture.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "A towering landmark of film, quite simply because it tells a good story, and tells it wonderfully well.",
    "Well, even if it is essentially four hours about a selfish, silly cow, it's impeccably well made, and should be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in romance or movies.",
    "One of the truly great films, destined for record-breaking box office business everywhere. The lavishness of its production, the consummate care and skill which went into its making, the assemblage of its fine cast and expert technical staff combine in presenting a theatrical attraction completely justifying the princely investment of $3,900,000.",
    "Some elements seem grotesquely dated, but this restoration of the 1939 classic finds the film as powerful and mad as ever.",
    "To see Gone With the Wind on a big screen again is to weep for the fearlessness with which Hollywood once believed the sublime was possible.",
    "The most striking effect of the Technicolor process is its subtlety. The viewer is aware of the gradations of flesh tones in Leigh's face and can see the color rise in her cheeks. The exact color of her eyes is a source of fascination (they are gray-blue with flashes of green).",
    "Whatever it was not, Gone With the Wind was a first-rate piece of Americana, and Americans in the mass knew what they wanted before the critics had got through telling them they should not want it.",
    "Is it the greatest motion picture ever made? Probably not, although it is the greatest motion mural we have seen and the most ambitious film-making venture in Hollywood's spectacular history.",
    "The sexual tension and humorous byplay between Leigh and co-star Clark Gable, in the role of gentleman rogue Rhett Butler, was riveting. And so was Leigh's portrayal of a viper trying to consume the good-hearted Ashley Wilkes, embodied by the fine-boned Hungarian-turned-British actor, Leslie Howard.",
    "To quote Olivia de Havilland, \"Everytime I see it, I find something fresh, some shade of meaning I hadn't noticed before.\"",
    "The picture is real, full of vitality and of so much human waywardness and nobility of spirit that it tears your heart out in sympathy with its tender and tragic passages and makes you want to shout with joy at its hearty humor.",
    "The older it gets, and we with it, the more we're able to see in it. As few American films have, Gone With the Wind succeeds both as historical epic and as intimate drama.",
    "Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh create their own sizzle as Rhett Butler and Scarlett O’Hara in a lavish four-hour epic that juxtaposes scenes of jaw-dropping majesty – that aerial shot of the Confederates’ wounded, for example – with moments of elegant intimacy and playful verbal jousting.",
    "Overblown and melodramatic, it somehow achieves more than the schmaltz of its parts, thanks to a spirited modern heroine, the spoilt Scarlett O'Hara, and its refusal to give us the neat conclusions you'd expect from a 19th-century saga of \"cottonfields and cavaliers.\"",
    "A critic-proof movie if there ever was one: it isn't all that good, but somehow it's great.",
    "Although this epic romantic melodrama is undoubtedly one of the most popular and beloved motion pictures ever to grace the silver screen, it is also arguably the most overrated. Gone with the Wind is a very good movie, perhaps bordering on being great, but its subject matter and running time (which is easily 60 minutes too long) argue against its status as a masterpiece.",
    "No one watches Gone with the Wind for historical accuracy. What keeps us coming back is four-hours of epic romance in gorgeous Technicolor.",
    "Rather than confront the guilt related to the sins of the past it paints over them in vivid colours, hoping the viewer will collude in its melodramatic muddying of the water."

Set during the American civil war and told from the perspective of white Southerners, the film has long been felt to be one of America’s finest. It took 10 gongs at the 1940 Oscars, including one for Hattie McDaniel, who was the first black person to win an Academy award.Sign up for Guardian Today US edition: the day's must-reads sent directly to you Read moreThe book, as well as the film, says Lumenick, “buys heavily into the idea that the civil war was a noble lost cause and casts Yankees and Yankee sympathisers as the villains”. It also, he writes, goes to “great lengths to enshrine the myth that the civil war wasn’t fought over slavery — an institution the film unabashedly romanticises”.Lumenick speculates that many in the Academy likely feel the same way, noting that The Wizard of Oz – which was defeated as best picture by Gone with the Wind in 1940 – received a special 75th anniversary tribute. But during the same ceremony (in which 12 Years a Slave was ultimately named best picture) Gone with the Wind was all but ignored.The critic concludes: “What does it say about us as a nation if we continue to embrace a movie that, in the final analysis, stands for many of the same things as the Confederate flag that flutters so dramatically over the dead and wounded soldiers at the Atlanta train station just before the intermission?”",

A film that immortalized the actors who gave life to it and which is already part of the memory of several generations. It won eight Oscars (Best Picture, BestThis film is probably one of the most remarkable in the history of cinema. A film that immortalized the actors who gave life to it and which is already part of the memory of several generations. It won eight Oscars (Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography Color, Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Leading Actress, Best Supporting Actress - for the first time given to a black actress - and even two special statuettes for RD Musgrave and William Cameron Menzies, for technical achievements) and was nominated for five more. Directed by Victor Fleming and produced by David O. Selznick, this film has a screenplay by Sidney Howard, based on a novel by Margaret Mitchell. The cast is headed by Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable.The story of this film is well known, so its difficult to spoil it. Scarlett is a rich, spoiled and capricious girl who likes parties and flirtations but loves Ashley Wilkes, engaged to her cousin Melanie, which awakens in her enormous jealousy. The hardness of the American Civil War destroys the world in which they live and forces the two cousins ​​to help each other to survive, achieving that with the help of Rhett Butler, an industrial bachelor with very bad reputation that falls in love with Scarlett. Following are the efforts to rebuild everything that the winds of war destroyed.Vivien Leigh became, thanks to this, a film legend. Far from being a damsel in distress, her character solves the problems faced thanks to her tenacity and willpower. Its undoubtedly one of the strongest female characters of classical cinema, and makes a perfect match with the bluntness of truculent Captain Butler, played by Gable, one of the biggest heartthrobs that cinema known, famous for the many romances that he lived with most beautiful actresses in Hollywood. In fact, when this film was being shot, the most malicious voices wove several conjectures as to a probable passion between them, but the truth was more funny: the two actors didn't like each other and Leigh even criticized Gable because of his bad breath. And although Gable have hated this movie, the truth is that he has become immortal thanks to it. Olivia de Havilland, another great actress, shone in the role of sweet and kindhearted Melanie, and Leslie Howard did great success as Ashley. Try to analyze the technical aspects of this film is very impressive and shows us the artwork that it is. Hundreds of participants, thousands of horses, costumes designed to recreate the look of the historical clothing. The country scenes are fabulous and some of the war scenes are deeply moving, like the scenes where Scarlett help in the military hospital or the famous Scarlett's oath scene. One of the most famous sequences is the fire of the military barracks, where real fire was used, making the scene more realistic and truly anthological. Bright colors make the movie even more beautiful, from a visual point of view, and the soundtrack, of Max Steiner's authorship, is exceptional. The main theme is easily in the ear, having become one of the most famous songs of the cinema.For all these reasons, this movie immediately gained a huge popularity and is, today, one of the most profitable and popular films ever. For me, its also the best movie ever, despite the many other great films that followed, through the decades.",

No matter where you stand politically and ethically, there is no denying the continued cultural and artistic merit this film maintains. The writing, the directing, the cinematography, special effects, editing, acting, character development, and score all maintain a sense of timelessness even today--nearly 80 years after this film first premiered. The film itself is very empathetic to the Confederacy and Slave culture as a whole. By all means, the film seeks to glorify and romanticize one of the darkest chapters in American history. Yet, the more socially progressive our society becomes the more important the film remains to be seen. Not as a celebration of our racism, but as a monument to never forget how messed up our culture was and continues to be. If anything, the film becomes almost a camp satire of itself--completely unaware of just how unethical and messed up it really is. This does not diminish its cultural relevance at all, but instead solidifies its importance.Slightly muted by the over-arching theme of slavery is the theme of a woman living in a society with a significant personality disorder that has gone diagnosed, and thus untreated. To many, including the society in which this story was written into as well as produced into a film, Scarlet's character can be immediately perceived as nothing more than, \"the typical woman; the stereotypical woman.\" She is not supposed to immediately be easy to empathize with; she is, in fact, supposed to represent the audience member that immediately does not care about history--she is the self-centered, privileged white woman in the enslaved south with only frivolous pursuits of social dominance and courtship to occupy her immediate head space and concerns. This works on many levels to really expose her character, and in turn something about the human condition as a whole: Scarlet starts from the absolute top of societal privilege--she is young, beautiful, and so immensely wealthy that she literally has no concerns in the world other than the one she chooses to makeup in her own head. On top of this, you've got Rhett--for all intensive purposes, the primary actual love interest of Scarlet throughout the movie. The two, in fact, do belong together because have how morally corrupted the both of them are. They, if anything, represent the two most morally corrupted people in all Confederate society. Willing to compromise loyalties for the sake of getting ahead. Then, of course, you have Ashley Wilkes and his wife that represent to Rhett and Scarlet the, \"idealistic, morally centered\" role models. However, nowadays this is the point where the satire comes in for screenings 80+ years later. EVERYONE is a slave owner, EVERYONE is fighting for the continued rate to use and profit from slave labor, so EVERYONE is already damned. If anything, Gone With the Wind is now a great representation of how an entire culture of people can be morally corrupted from the get go, but when you're surrounded by **** the debate comes down to which person's **** smells less bad. When it comes to that final line exchange of dialogue between Rhett and Scarlet at the end--at one time, the audience was supposed to side solely with Rhett who is now completely fed up both with himself, Scarlet, and the relationship as a whole. No one is truly, \"innocent\" in this mess--but, now with the added awareness of people with personality disorders, if anyone, Scarlet remains the most sympathetic character. Rhett is just a piece of **** unable to get over himself for anyone but the reflection of himself he saw in his daughter. But still--no one can actually be empathized with anymore because everyone owns slaves! It's a hilarious conundrum of already being damned by birthright.",

I think the movie does suffer from the slow pace of the second half, but still proves itself of being fantastic.This is a must see movie, a movie that has arguably been set as the foundation of movies today and contains many timeless classic pop-culture references.",
