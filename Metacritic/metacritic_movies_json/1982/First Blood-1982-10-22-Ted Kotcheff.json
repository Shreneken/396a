    "critic_reviews": [
        "There's the fact that First Blood is a first-rate, taught action thriller.",
        "First Blood is not the Rambo movie we initially think of when the character is mentioned. No, it\u2019s much better than that.",
        "Until the last twenty or thirty minutes, however, First Blood is a very good movie, well-paced, and well-acted not only by Stallone (who invests an unlikely character with great authority) but also by Crenna and Brian Dennehy, as the police chief.",
        "Boasting some of the best use of rugged landscape since the westerns of Anthony Mann, First Blood is an effective, if outlandish, picture that exists merely for its big-screen thrills.",
        "The darker tone, somber subtext, and generally non-exploitative violence allow viewers to enjoy the film not only as an action/thriller but as something with a degree of intelligence and substance.",
        "The director, Ted Kotcheff, does a good job with the violence and suspense, working well with the wide-screen format, and he seems fully aware of the dark, subversive implications of the material, even if the screenplay doesn't allow him to resolve them successfully.",
        "It's a film with a number of strengths, not the least of them its fierce, agile, hollow-eyed hero.",
        "As a Stallone vehicle this is sleek, slick and not unexciting, but crassly castrates the David Morrell novel on which it is based.",
        "Director Ted Kotcheff has all sorts of trouble with this mess, aside from credibility. Supposedly, the real villain here is society itself, which invented a debacle like Vietnam and must now deal with its lingering tragedies. But First Blood cops out completely on that one, not even trying to find a solution to Stallone's problems."

I certainly felt on the side of the main character and it'd be hard not to be annoyed at the local sheriff, William Teasel. It was interesting how he reacted to the colonel who stepped in to try and save him from Rambo. The dynamics of the characters are good I suppose but of course this is, first and foremost/primarily, an action film. There are certainly some good explosions and chase scenes.

I own them all and i like them all, but Rambo 2-4 are just \"Lets Rambo kill hundreds of bad guys\" without a real story. Rambo - first blood, shows a vietnam vet mocked without a reason by some Polivemen. Because of his experience during his prison in vietnam he starts raging and runs away from the cops and hides in the woods. The Cops start to act violently against him, until he starts to return the favour. In this movie Rambo avoids violence for a long time. Its not a blood and gorefest like the other parts. Thumbs up for one of the best true action movies. Good storytelling and good entertainement, without CG Explosions and stuff, needed in todays movies.",
