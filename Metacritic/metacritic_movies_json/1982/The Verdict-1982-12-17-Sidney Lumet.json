    "summary": "An attorney (Paul Newman) recognizes the opportunity to salvage his career and self-respect by taking a medical malpractice case to trial rather than settling.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "The screenplay by David Mamet is a wonder of good dialogue, strongly seen characters and a structure that pays off in the big courtroom scene - as the genre requires.",
        "Admittedly this is a legal \"Rocky, convincing rather than realistic, witty rather than analytical, but it amounts to a far more effective indictment of the US legal system than ...and justice for all, and is the first courtroom drama in years to recapture the brilliance of the form.",
        "A solidly old-fashioned courtroom drama such as The Verdict could have gotten by with a serious, measured performance from its leading man, or it could have worked well with a dazzling movie-star turn. The fact that Paul Newman delivers both makes a clever, suspenseful, entertaining movie even better.",
        "This is realistic American film acting at its veristic/imaginative best.",
        "Sidney Lumet directs effectively, keeping the tension strong, and unfolding David Mamet's intelligent screenplay slowly but with maximum impact.",
        "Though screenwriter David Mamet writes some chewy lines, director Sidney Lumet balances out any pulpiness with a somber mood, making sparing use of the musical score and creating a Boston awash in brown, beige, and gray.",
        "If you were presenting a case for Newman\u2019s legacy of acting brilliance, this film would be exhibit A.",
        "It's Newman's performance itself that really makes this film work and helps it truly get close to Lumet's own '12 Angry Men'.",
        "What was boring and dull to our 12-year-old selves back when Dad was watching this film 25 years ago is now a thoroughly engrossing and satisfying film experience, and a reminder that what is old can be new again -- whether it's Newman's Galvin's outlook on life, an old courtroom drama premise, or a movie revisited after a quarter century lapse.",
        "Sidney Lumet's direction, like David Mamet's patchy script (which adapts a Barry Reed novel), may not be quite good enough to justify the Rembrandt-like cinematography of Edward Pisoni and the brooding mood of self-importance, but it's good direction nonetheless; and there are plenty of supporting performances\u2014by James Mason, Jack Warden, Milo O'Shea, Charlotte Rampling, and Lindsay Crouse, among others\u2014to keep one distracted from Newman's dogged Oscar-pandering.",
        "There are many fine performances and sensitive moral issues contained in The Verdict but somehow that isn't enough to make it the compelling film it should be. David Mamet's script [from a novel by Barry Reed] offers little out of the ordinary."
