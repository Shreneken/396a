  "title": "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan",
  "rating": 8.2,

  "summary": "With the aide of the Enterprise crew, Admiral Kirk must stop an old nemesis, Khan Noonien Singh, from using the Genesis Device as the ultimate weapon.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The second Star Trek movie is swift, droll and adventurous, not to mention appealingly gadget-happy. It's everything the first one should have been and wasn't.",
    "The Wrath of Khan is a top-notch, fast-paced adventure that can be enjoyed equally by fans of the series and those who have never seen an episode.",
    "Not least among Khan's pleasures is the way it continually veers toward, but never quite crosses, the neutral zone between space opera and interstellar camp. By the end, it becomes simply operatic, with a death scene of surprising emotional power.",
    "This is hands-down the best Trek flick made so far.",
    "It's a tale told with considerable warmth and humour, some spiffing explosions and a multiple-hanky act of self-sacrifice to round things off.",
    "Itâ€™s still entertaining and charming in its innocent idealism.",
    "This is one of the most popular in the series, thanks to a high action quotient (including a tensely staged space battle), a suitably campy turn by Montalban, and the shock value of Spock's death. There is some novelty value, too, in the focus on Kirk's family life back on Earth.",
    "I don't much care if the battles aren't that amazing, because the story doesn't depend on them. It's about a sacrifice made by Spock, and it draws on the sentiment and audience identification developed over the years by the TV series.",
    "A brisk, handsomely designed film in which its hardware, sturdy as it is, never overwhelms its humanity.",
    "One leaves the film neither hugely thrilled nor greatly awed, but with a pleasant sense of having caught up with old friends and found them to be just fine, pretty much the way one hoped they would turn out in later life.",
    "If only director Nicholas Meyer had grasped the implications of his tale more fully and enthusiastically, this might have become a classic piece of cornball SF poetry, but as it stands the tepid acting and one-set claustrophobia take a heavy toll.",
    "For a major sci-fi release in the Star Wars era, it's surprisingly slow and even maudlin.",
    "Foregoing the special effects bonanza of its predecessor, it settles for low camp humanoid melodrama."

Not having watched the original series, I wasn't able to immediately understand the movie which, experts say, consists of the continuation of one of the episodes. But the film itself gives us the tools to catch everything quickly. And we must now say an obvious truth: after the failure of the first film it was difficult to do worse, and this film benefited greatly from the lessons learned with the mistakes of the first one. The script is frankly good, based on a revenge story between Kirk and Khan, and it has no dead moments nor creeps like the first movie. The main actors (William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley) shone, in particular Shatner and Nimoy, without however being able to overshadow the talent of Ricardo Montalban, who managed to make his villain into a perfect image of rancor. As for the sets and costumes, there are also improvements: the hospital environment of the first film gave way to a setting where color is most evident and the Enterprise's crew red uniforms are truly elegant. The only less positive note is the costumes of Khan and his comrades of misfortune, who seem to have come out of \"Conan the Barbarian\" or something like that, but this is something that has no great relevance. Good movie, good entertainment.",

They took a darker approach with elements from Moby Dick, Shakespeare, Paradise Lost and it has a lot of character development. It is about past mistakes, grief, obsessions and dealing with harsh situations. The Kobayashi Maru scenario / test / trope became popular from this movie. The acting is so good. The whole crew delivers their best performance. Spock and Kirk especially. The last scene with Spock is the most emotional moment in the whole Star Trek franchise. Kirk has to deal with past decisions and a problem he never truly overcame. Scotty, Mc Coy, Uhura, Sulu and Chekoy do also well. For the new characters: Saavik is an interesting character. Did you know that she married Spock (Non canon). She is at the beginning of her career and is struggling with some experiences that came along. Carol and David Marcus are something that show how Kirks live could become if he took another route in life. Khan is also the best villain in franchise history. He is so driven by his revenge that the comparison to captain Ahab is natural. He rightfully deserved a place in pop-culture history and is present in many top villain lists. Then there is the story. It is exiting and entertaining for the whole movie. The final is still unbeaten today. They took so many good ideas in this movie and executed them well. Nothing feels forced or unbelievable here. Overall this was a masterpiece that you can even recommend to non Star Trek fans. Also it is seen as most influential Star Trek movie and for some in the Top 10 for Science Fiction movies. Extra Knowledge: After Kirk some cadets have also beaten the Kobayashi Maru scenario. Mac Kenzie Calhoun had the most interesting approach. He destroyed the Kobayashi Maru. He argued that this was a trap. A cargo ship with so much passengers, far off their route in an ideal intercepting position and no response from the Klingon's yet. Even when this was not the case a fast dead was better than imprisonment by Klingon's (Confirmed in Star Trek 6 for me).",

Kirk), Leonard Nimoy(Mr. Spock), James Doohan(Scotty),Ricardo Montalban(Khan), and Bibi Besch(Carol)\rMy Review\rThis film is said to be the best Star Trek movie ever made, and if that's the case then I'm quite frightened but still curious. I am frightened because I think this Star Trek film is great but the villain is memorable because of this. The only action sequences are ship and gun fire. While in some ways the action scenes were enjoyable i was expecting more.\rThe film revolves around Admiral Kirk(who I thought was a captain but I guess that's in the new movies only) who escapes the tedium desk job to join Mr.Spock. In the midst is an old enemy from there past Khan.\rIn the opening sequence you get this look at how new cadets train to lead the enterprise and in the simulation and after you meet our characters Mr.Spock,Uhura,Scotty,and afterwards James T. Kirk.\rI only saw this because I am getting ready for the release of the latest Star Trek film, and in the new one is this villain(Khan) who is widely known by the fans of this series. Personally I do nit like Khan in this movie. I like the actor who plays him cause his performance of the character is amazing but Khan I feel doesn't do much in the movie except puts worms in peoples ears and commands them, and gives orders to destroy the enterprise and James T. Kirk.\rThe Special effects are really great in this film for it's time but like the effects and the rest of the film i feel it's really dated and doesn't hold up. But it is still one of the best Star Trek movies.",

It is short on technical aspects like visual effects, sound department, production design, costume design and editing. The script has a lot of crispness in it to make it to screen and offer the audience the essential cinematic experience but what it lacks is enough concrete material to feed the audience for its almost two hours. Nicholas Meyers; the screenwriter-director, has got the appropriate vision and even though he fails to execute it as anticipated, the impact makes it worth the effort and time in here. The performance is plausible in here especially by the newer member Khan played by Ricardo Monatalbam and stayed true to their return roles by William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and Deforest Kelly as a supporting cast. Star Trek : The Wrath Of Khan encourages the enraging behavior and allows the audience to shift on definite answers through moral complications and nail-biting dramatic sequences.",
