    "critic_reviews": [
        "Those tensions and conflicts produced, I believe, the right film for this material. I don't require that its makers had a good time. I'm reminded of my favorite statement by Francois Truffaut: \"I demand that a film express either the joy of making cinema or the agony of making cinema. I am not at all interested in anything in between.\"",
        "Extraordinary.",
        "An eye-popping dramatization of an audio storyline. Being a visual translation of a so-called 'concept' album, pic works extremely well in carrying over the somber tone of the LP.",
        "The words \"overblown\" and \"pompous\" often came to mind. At other times, though, everything comes together-- music, images, and theme-- to really make a stoner go \"whooooah.\"",
        "His The Wall is a good-looking film, and it has no shortage of nerve. When he puts an entire schoolchildren's choir on a conveyor belt leading into a meat grinder as they sing, ''We don't need no education,'' he is being nothing if not bold. These effects, while some are individually powerful, are dwarfed by the towering selfimportance of The Wall and by its lack of focus.",
        "Thematically the film is banal, and even its simple themes of alienation, loneliness, and paranoia are muddled and sapped of relevancy by the overblown treatment. Geldof is effective in the lead, and the animation sequences by political cartoonist Gerald Scarfe are interesting and well executed, though too long.",
        "Overwrought live-action sequences, surreal-to-the-point-of-bewildering animation - The Wall grabs your attention but doesn't know what to say once it's got it.",
        "All in all, it's just another flick to appal.",
        "Parker's fatal misjudgment is failing to recognize that a solemnly expressionistic movie presentation of themes from \"The Wall\" tends to magnify its inherent lack of dramatic substance."

Pink Floyd The Wall is the best band/opera kind of film, as it tells its story intricately, with beautiful animation, deep themes, and a sense of overall visual uniqueness (not to mention one of the greatest soundtracks of all time). The critic's score is way too low. I'll admit it's a tiny bit repetitive, but it's a minor complaint because I was already so invested in the movie that some redundant scenes weren't much of a detractor. Check it out to form an opinion on this surrealist piece of art.",

It is one long music video, which is not really a negative, not with this movie.I don't listen to a lot of Pink Floyd's music, so watching this was quite the surreal experience, but I connected and understood the surrealness to a weird extent. I think anyone who is or is not a fan will have an interesting and unique experience. Any sort of character development comes through the music, which itself tells the whole story. This will be the closest we will ever come to examine Roger Waters mindset and feelings.The songs themselves are not only amazing, but brilliantly expressed and unequal compared to other bands. The animated sequences that went with the songs were so remarkable it makes the songs strike an extra chord to your subconscious.Overall rating: RIP Alan Parker. A brilliant director who took a band and adapted it into cinema.",
