    "summary": "When an imaginative boy meets a lost alien, it is the beginning of one of cinema's most endearing friendships as Elliot (Henry Thomas) helps the marvelous creature he calls E.T. find his way back home before government agents can capture him.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Spielberg's direction and Melissa Mathison's script never lose sight of the realistic, low center of gravity world of childhood, in which such marvelous adventures happen every day that an alien knocking around the garage is not really such an unusual occurrence. [2002 re-release]",
        "It's one modern film worthy of being called a contemporary classic. [2002 re-release]",
        "Music for the eyes. That's why it has become a treasured classic. That's why we'll see it again and again. [2002 re-release]",
        "Spielberg wrote a poem.  And all the best movies are poems.  [2002 re-release]",
        "E.T. is ultimately a tale of love, and the film becomes a cathartic leap into pure feeling. [2002 re-release]",
        "It\u2019s no news to anyone that \u201cE.T.\u201d is one of the loveliest and happiest of American movie entertainments. It\u2019s also a greater picture than we could have known. [2002 re-release]",
        "If we approach the unfamiliar with fear and apprehension, we will be met with fear and apprehension. But if we approach with sympathy and curiosity, we will be rewarded with same. And our souls, not to mention our bicycles, will soar to the heavens. [2002 re-release]",
        "Steven Spielberg has done it again. He has created another instant American classic.",
        "From the pitch-perfect characterisation to John Williams\u2019 soaring score to the magical effects, it\u2019s every bit as good as you remember. [2002 re-release]",
        "Yes, the film does strum the heartstrings a bit too emphatically toward the end, by cranking up Williams' music and giving us perhaps one tear too many, but that's a minor quibble. When Elliott and his friends soar on their bicycles, like flying Peter Pans who must soon grow up, it's as touching and note-perfect a moment as any in the movies. [2002 re-release]",
        "Seeing E.T. again reminds us of how much we've remained the same, how gratified we still are by a film that connects so beautifully to our sense of wonder and joy. [2002 re-release]",
        "We now have the distance to see just how close to a flawless and utterly timeless a film Steven Spielberg and his collaborators crafted \u2013 one that transcended genres (sci-fi and kids\u2019 movies) to become of one of the greatest and most durable of American movies. [2002 re-release]",
        "Spielberg has always demonstrated extraordinary aptitude for filmmaking, but \"E.T.\" is far and away his most satisfying work to date. He knows how to transform the raw material of his childhood into an appealing popular fable. There are sequences that touch you to the quick in mysteriously casual ways",
        "Just as moving, uplifting and funny as ever in its slightly modified form. [2002 re-release]",
        "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial is a reminder of what movies are for. Most movies are not for any one thing, of course. Some are to make us think, some to make us feel, some to take us away from our problems, some to help us examine them. What is enchanting about \"E.T.\" is that, in some measure, it does all of those things. [2002 re-release]",
        "The movie is emotionally tumultuous and evenhanded and serene. It celebrates the odd pockets of imagination and individuality that can be nurtured in middle-class suburbia. [2002 re-release]",
        "I have written elsewhere that love stories seem to be in short supply these days, as they have been in the last decade of American movies. . . . But the hunger for love on the screen is there, and director Spielberg gives it to us in \"E.T.,\" and because the lovers are a little boy and a little creature, we accept it. Of such simple concepts, timeless entertainments are made.",
        "The film's real power to move flows from its low, childlike angles, which, rather than infantalize its audience, bring it down to where the hurt and fear, and hence the comfort, loom larger. [2002 re-release]",
        "There are some unsatisfactory elements\u2013slow spots occur during the middle stretch, the mild anti-establishment stance is getting to be a bit cliche and one never knows whether E.T.\u2019s mortal illness is physical or psychological in nature, or both. But, as with \u201cClose Encounters,\u201d the truly lovely and moving ending more than makes up for everything. Chalk up another smash for Spielberg.",
        "\"E.T.\" is as contemporary as laser-beam technology, but it's full of the timeless longings expressed in children's literature of all eras.",
        "Though the story feels standard, the fun comes from the meticulously realized details that director Steven Spielberg and associate producer-writer Melissa Mathison have injected into the material.",
        "When E.T. debuts on DVD, you can choose between the new version, which better matches E.T.'s words to his lips, and the sweetly clunky, digitally deprived version redolent of penis breath. I don't need to phone home to know which one I'm buying. [2002 re-release]",
        "Doesn't make it a masterpiece, but it's fun. [2002 re-release]",
        "Spielberg has always shown a penchant for overt manipulation, but nowhere is this more obvious than in E.T., where he pulls out all the stops in an effort to bleed tears from the eyes of every audience member. It doesn't take a cynical nature to recognize what the director is doing. [2002 re-release]",
        "Spielberg's sledgehammer way with emotional moments, never more obvious than here, kills some of the pleasure for adults and robs the movie of the ultimate laurel -- classic status. [2002 re-release]",
        "Though marred by Spielberg's usual carelessness with narrative points, the film alternates sweetness and sarcasm with enough rhetorical sophistication to be fairly irresistible.",
        "The story itself holds up fairly well though, twenty years later, does come off as thinner than I recalled. [2002 re-release]",
        "E.T. is a dog movie. Genre-wise, I mean. It's about a boy meeting a dog, naming it, taming it, learning from it, and growing up. Of course, the genre is superficially disguised as science fiction, as was the fashion at the time. [2002 re-release]"

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nHE IS AFRAID\rHE IS ALONE\rHE IS 3,000,000 LIGHT YEARS AWAY FROM HOME\r Weather you like it or not, I truly believe at everyone has to admit that E.T. Is a pristine example of a perfect film! It is so much more than a little boy meeting a slimy little alien. E.T. Is the 1982 masterpiece about the innocence of nature not only from this world, but the innocence that the rest of the universe might quite possibly obtain. E.T. shows you that no matter how far away, sometimes the most important person in your life could be one that lives 3,000,000 light years away from you and that despite the distance, you and that person will always have a phenomenally strong connection no matter what. It shows in the film when E.T. gives his life for Elliot out of nothing less than pure true love and compassion for him.\r The cast is phenomenal despite only making one true star, Drew Barrymore, while she's fantastic, Henry Thomas Knocks it out of the park with the greatest  performance I have seen from a child actor ever. This movie s brilliantly directed by Steven Spielberg who made so man fantastic decisions, such as filming the scenes in order of when they occur in the story so that the child actors would not get confused. Steven Spielberg, a man who planned to never have children, was convinced due to how like able these child actors were. Spielberg has even claimed that he feels like they were his first kids, he basically was there for Drew Barrymore's entire life and is basically a father figure to her.\r E.T. Is easily the most emotional film of all time as well, making little kids to grown men cry like a lost kitten not once, but twice in the film! The film also manages to have it's little comedic moment to lighten up the mood, which are placed out perfectly throughout the film. Not to mention the adult cast is amazing as well, specifically Dee Wallace, who might very well be the ultimate mother figure to ever grace the big screen playing the type of role countless of times. It is a movie that is perfectly paced throughout it's two hour runtime that just draws you into the story and towards the end makes you crave for more like the chunky lad on a baseball team craving a bottle of water after running to first base. It perfectly builds up to an epic finally completely built up by your emotions which consists one of the greatest scores in film history by John Williams.\r Not to mention E.T. Steals the show by completely controlling the audiences hearts like a puppet on strings. E.T. is so easy to just fall in love with that he could even make a queen xenomorph tear up!  This film truly shows how you could use practical effects rather than CGI, check out the deleted scenes in the twentieth anniversary edition, in a much more effective way. E.T. remained the highest-grossing film of all time for about twenty-one years until another definitive Spielberg film called Jurassic Park. E.T. blew up like a pimple on prom night, being on the cover of everything such as, T-shirts, cereal, and candy. Hell,  E.T. even became best friends in real life with the so called \"greatest entertainer to ever live Michael Jackson,\"to the point where they even took one of the most iconic images involving the two from the iconic E.T. soundtrack.\r E.T. is probably the only big moneymaker in film history to escape an amateur sequel, trust me I read the plot, because Spielberg came and told the studio that they couldn't do a sequel, because they truly did have a perfect film.......and the studio agreed for once. E.T. Not only is the biggest film to come out of the 80's, but it is probably the first movie to gain as much support from the audience as it did. E.T. Is still remembered today as one of the all time greatest masterpieces in film history and still continues to touch audiences hearts around the planet..........and will continue to do so until the end of time! E.T. is Pure....... Perfection! My Favorite Film Of All Time!",

The plot enlightened me. It messed with my emotions. It made me feel like a child again. The film contained many important contributions to plot build up. Especially the part when Elliott was at school and connected to E.T. My most favorite part of the film was the bike ride. Or should I say bike flight. It just might be one of my favorite scenes in cinematic history. It made me believe I too could fly on a bike. Okay, not really because I am aware that it is just a movie. But I'm sure you understand what I'm getting at. I highly recommend this film to anyone and everyone. To parents reading this you might want to show this to your kids because it's great for the imagination. I'm pretty sure that penis breath could escape there mind.",

Truly a timeless disaster. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial certainly stands as a testament toOne day, people will eventually realize that E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is a bad movie. I did not like it as a child and could not stand it as an adult. Truly a timeless disaster. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial certainly stands as a testament to how little I can stand children in films. The kids in this film are universally grating and deserve to be run over with a steamroller. In particular, Drew Barrymore plays the annoying little snitch of a little sister and she does nothing scream in a high-pitched little kid scream and it drove me mad. Alongside her, Henry Thomas plays an annoying ten-year-old who apparently was tasked with, along with the rest of his class, to kill frogs for dissection. Absolutely wild. When I dissected frogs in high school, they were dead already. We did not have to kill them ourselves. Are these the horror stories of growing up that will be told by people that were young in the 1980s? Instead of having to walk up and down hill in a driving blizzard, they had to kill frogs with chloroform and then cut them up. Predictable, lacking wonder and magic, and simply overly manipulative and sentimental, E.T. is yet another 1980s childhood classic that I hate, joining esteemed company with Gremlins (why does that woman want to kill the dog) and The Goonies (where did they find all these annoying little screamers in the 80s).The film is simply unfunny, in spite of attempts to be funny. Scenes of E.T. getting drunk and having some weird connection with Elliott (Thomas) that makes him drunk and kiss a girl with a fat kid serving as a lift for the shorter Elliott are creepy. Now, it is in line with E.T. as a whole who is creepily designed and then lures Elliott in with candy. Slow your roll, pervert. Add in the alcohol that gives him the guts to kiss a girl and the film has worrying messages about drinking and candy from strangers. A series of reaction shots towards the end of the boys on bicycles making weird faces as they fly are also incredibly grating and seem like something out of Tommy Wiseau's The Room instead of an alleged childhood classic. The only part of the movie that is funny is when Michael (Robert MacNaughton) finds E.T. burning in the sun and a raccoon was clearly hanging around and possibly eating E.T. That still makes me laugh.The film is also quite cliched in its plotting with the kids all doubting Elliott, the kids getting behind Elliott, the mom freaking out, and then the adults who do not understand E.T. or kids get in the way and \"kill\" him. Even worse, the astronauts just bust into the home like common cat burglars. They are coming in from every window in a honestly surreal sequence that feels like something out of Blue Velvet and not a Spielberg film. Even worse, the scene where E.T. dies (unfortunate, since Elliott is saved as a result and yells, gratingly, in agony) is obviously a fake out as we just wait Elliott to go over and save him with the power of love. Wrapped up with a similarly sentimental ending, E.T. is merely a manipulative film that uses emotions regarding death and the loss of a parent to adultery as a gateway to trying and getting people to cry. It has no sense of wonder or magic in its own story, just sappy emotions and sentimentality that feel unearned with a hollow emotional core in the film.The only source of any magic and wonder is the score from John Williams, which admittedly sounds good, but it entirely used as a crutch. The characters have to literally scream over the score with Williams' music sounding more akin to the Oscars playing somebody off the stage during the acceptance speech than a film score. Constantly telling the audience how to fell and single-handedly trying to make the film feel wondrous as a celebration of childhood and imagination, the score just does not work in this film because of bad mixing. It just distracts too much and tries to manipulate the audience into buying the sentimental and sappy emotions of the plot and dialogue. It nearly works and has made many people cry, but for those not buying the plot and dialogue, the score just becomes massively annoying with the score constantly getting louder and louder.With a creepy connection between a boy and the alien at the center of this film, a lack of originality, a predictable plot, annoying child actors, a score that is too loud, no comedy, no wonder, and no magic, E.T. is a disaster of a childhood film. It may appeal to the vast majority of people, but I desperately wanted this thing to end. The adults being the bad guys because they do not let kids run all over the earth acting like **** is a truly annoying trope and this film relies upon it quite heavily. All in all, this film may have some fun special effects and is glorious in its 1980s cheese while being mildly entertaining, but it largely falls flat and is hardly an enjoyable experience due to the litany of issues it has.",

Despite theAt their best, both Spielberg and Lucas make idealized versions of the kinds of films they loved as kids, in the process furnishing this generation\u2019s filmgoers with visual treats of unprecedented skill and sophistication. Despite the continual presence of the little Yoda-like creature, \u201cE.T.\u201d is not first and foremost an effects picture, but rather a charming \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d-like fable which reminds by turns of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d \u201cMary Poppins,\u201d a benign switch on \u201cKing Kong\u201d and a variation of Spielberg\u2019s own \u201cClose Encounters.\u201d\r Opening sequence actually comes off like a repeat of \u201cClose Encounters\u201d\u2018 final frames, as a sizeable spaceship takes off just before some earthly authorities are able to close in on it. One of its occupants gets left behind, however, and the viewer is instantly sympathetic with its plight in the threateningly different environment of a modern California subdivision.\r E.T. is highly fortunate to be found by young Henry Thomas who, after some understandable initial fright, takes the \u2018goblin\u2019 in, first as a sort of pet and then as a friend he must guard against the more preying elements of human society. Over time, Thomas teaches E.T. how to talk and includes his older brother (Robert MacNaughton) and younger sister (Drew Barrymore) in on the secret, even as he manages to hide his discovery from his mother (Dee Wallace).\r Ultimately, of course, the official representatives of society locate E.T., which seems to occasion a rapid decline in its health until it appears to die. When it revives, Thomas marshals his friends into a kids\u2019 commando squad to spirit E.T. back to the spaceship which is on its way to a rescue rendezvous.\r First element which had to work to insure film\u2019s success was E.T. itself. As superlatively created by Carlo Rambaldi, the creature manages to project both a wondrous childlike quality and a sense of superior powers. Cutely awkward in its movements, the being has rubbery brown skin, an extendable neck and possesses eyes which dilate on cue. It even gets to play a drunk scene, perhaps a first for screen aliens. Assuredly not lost on those involved with the film are the opportunities for E.T.-related toys and dolls, which are enormous.\r An amusing sidelight to the tale is that the action takes place in a suburban household almost identical to that in the Spielberg-produced \u201cPoltergeist,\u201d which leads to the thought that the two, distinctly different stories could be unfolding in neighboring homes simultaneously. In fact, many of the motifs in the early going are similar to those in \u201cPoltergeist\u201d\u2013the middle-class family, the blonde dog, goldfish, people glaring into bright lights in awe and disbelief.\r But \u201cE.T.\u201d will surely prove an embraceable film by the general public. Rarely has a picture so completely evinced a kid\u2019s p.o.v. and shown the complicity of youngsters against adults. It\u2019s been said that the only people who don\u2019t like Disneyland are late adolescents who feel too hip to enjoy the pleasures of their earlier years, and the same will probably hold true for \u201cE.T.\u201d\r As can be expected for Spielberg and the Industrial Light & Magic shop, the technical effects are state-of-the-art superb. Enough cannot be said for John Williams\u2019 score, which stands as a model of film composing\u2013although it is almost continually present it\u2019s also practically unnoticeable, so well does it both complement and further the events onscreen.\r As far as the performances go, the key was finding three kids who could respond with both innocence and gumption to the arrival of E.T. All fulfill the requirements, and Thomas is perfect in the lead, playing the childhood equivalent of Spielberg\u2019s everyman heroes of his previous pics.\r There are some unsatisfactory elements\u2013slow spots occur during the middle stretch, the mild anti-establishment stance is getting to be a bit cliche and one never knows whether E.T.\u2019s mortal illness is physical or psychological in nature, or both. But, as with \u201cClose Encounters,\u201d the truly lovely and moving ending more than makes up for everything. Chalk up another smash for Spielberg.",

It not only entertains very young children and their parents but it reaches out to the child within us, that is something I want to feel when I watch a movie from my childhood. I love films like Beauty and the Beast, The Wizard of Oz, Mary Poppins and The NeverEnding Story for exactly that reason. The film is beautifully filmed, with breathtaking cinematography and beautiful scenery. The scene with ET and Elliot on the bicycle is just an amazing scene, I think John Williams's amazing score is to thank for that. The special effects are excellent, and the script is funny and touching. There is one sight gag with ET hiding among Elliot's stuffed animal toys that warms my heart every time. The acting is very good, with Henry Thomas appealing as Elliot and Dee Wallace sincere and sensitive as the mother. I also loved Drew Barrymore as the sassy and big-mouthed sister. What makes this film though is ET himself, even with his large eyes and long arms for an alien ET is adorable, sad and sweet. The part when Elliot cries when ET is dying is a real tearjerker, it kills me every time I see this film. Overall, I love this film, it is so special and delightful. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

This is precisely the subject of this film, which is part of the collective memory of most people and that is undoubtedly one of the most notable films of Steven Spielberg's career. Directed by him and with a script by Melissa Mathison, this film has the participation of Henry Thomas (as Elliott) and Drew Barrymore (as Gertie). The alien's voice belongs to Pat Welsh, an old woman who smoked two packs of cigarettes daily just to achieve the hoarseness required for the role (at a time when technology wasn't what we have today, that's what was done, and I just hope she didn't suffer from the lungs later).Personally, I consider this the most remarkable film of Spielberg's career so far, despite the success he achieved before with \"Jaws\" and \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" and even of many other blockbuster films he made after. Spielberg has always shown a particular talent for sci-fi themes, very present in his work and presented here at an audience younger than what is normally the target of alien movies. Despite the theme and suspense throughout the film, we can consider it a family film. The suspense alternates with very funny moments, where children (and their interaction with their new friend) reign at all. Drew Barrymore deserves particular attention: this lovely girl, screaming like a grown, won with this film a well deserved stardom, unfortunately tapped the hard way over the next decade in an absolutely downward path, which the actress has only recently recovered. Henry Thomas was also good in his role, grabbing it with vigor and commitment. The special effects, as usual in films of this director, are excellent and the soundtrack is one of the best of John Williams. Some of the scenes on this film became so famous that come naturally to our memory and are known even to those who have never seen the movie. This is the case of the flying bike passing in front of the full moon, one of the most beautiful and striking scenes in sci-fi, along with that famous scene where E.T. finger lights touching on Elliott's forehead.This film is recommended to all families of all ages. Its a truly timeless film, which was done without the massive computerization we are used to, which ends up being an advantage to make it more genuine. Moving and emotional, he entertains any audience so well that it's not surprising the huge success it had at the box office. Winner of Oscars for Best Soundtrack, Best Special Effects, Best Sound Effects and Best Sound (1983), it also won the Golden Globes for Best Dramatic Film and Best Soundtrack. This is that sci-fi film that will decidedly please even those who don't appreciate this kind of movies.",

I miss those times terribly, however I can imagine how amazing it would have been to see it in cinemas back then! It is one of the best films ever created accompanied by one of the best soundtracks to ever be recorded. It is charming, funny and tear-jerking and the plot is straight to the point with each scene executed beautifully! This movie is a must watch and an all time-classic.
