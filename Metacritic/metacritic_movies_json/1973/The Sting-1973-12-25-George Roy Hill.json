  "critic_reviews": [
    "In an age when films such as Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven are revered for their trickery, The Sting remains the definitive con artist comedy: as irresistible and ingenious as the scheme that hooks in Doyle.",
    "The Sting is the most purely enjoyable film in Oscar history – and that, I think, puts it in the most valuable American film-making tradition of all.",
    "One of those instances where everything good about Hollywood just fell into one place at the right time, it's almost impossible not to get swept up in the vivaciousness of The Sting as a whole. Magnificent, timeless stuff.",
    "The style here is so seductive and witty it's hard to pin down. It's like nothing else I've seen by Hill, and at times, it almost reminds me of Jacques Tati crossed with Robert Altman. It's good to get a crime movie more concerned with humor and character than with blood and gore; here's one, as we say, for the whole family.",
    "Redford offers just the right amounts of arrogance and innocence to make Hooker a believable hustler but half-hearted scoundrel.",
    "The Sting has all the signs of a blockbuster. Paul Newman and Robert Redford are superbly reteamed, this time as a pair of con artists in Chicago of the ’30s, out to fleece a bigtime racketeer brilliantly cast with and played by Robert Shaw. George Roy Hill’s outstanding direction of David S. Ward’s finely-crafted story of multiple deception and surprise ending will delight both mass and class audiences. Extremely handsome production values and a great supporting cast round out the virtues.",
    "The Chicago locations are well used by veteran director George Roy Hill, and the wonderful 30s movie style (lots of horizontal and vertical wipes, flipping screens, irises in and out) enhances the sense of good, harmless, nostalgic fun.",
    "The Sting represents one of the most popular, widely-loved films to win Best Picture in the last half-century and an example of grand entertainment.",
    "In an era full of auteur-driven turbulence in Hollywood, The Sting stands out as a model of old-school craft, a richly appointed studio production with big stars and a premium on efficiency and pace.",
    "A lot of the other period details aren't too firmly anchored in time, but the film is so good-natured, so obviously aware of everything it's up to, even its own picturesque frauds, that I opt to go along with it. One forgives its unrelenting efforts to charm, if only because The Sting itself is a kind of con game, devoid of the poetic aspirations that weighed down \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\"",
    "But the look of a movie is not as important as how it feels. The Sting feels like a cold shower. One dashes into it primarily because of its superior cast.",
    "All a bit soulless, but at least there's no equivalent of the 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head' sequence. All those who liked the earlier film should enjoy this as much.",
    "The plot has many twists, few surprises, and one gaping hole, which becomes apparent only after you walk out of the theater and have a chance to think. But pure popcorn like this is hardly worthy of serious analysis...Fortunately, the stars have not lost their charm and authority.",
    "Vastly overrated Crooks-R-Us--this time you wear the moustache, enhanced by fine period trappings and flavor. Ultimately empty stuff, but preferable to \"Butch Cassidy.\""

      "content": "The Sting is the equivalent of Windows 95, foundational and necessary for subsequent follow ups but unless you have nostalgia for it, or just really wanna play the original solitaire, there's no reason to go back to it. The Sting is a heistThe Sting is the equivalent of Windows 95, foundational and necessary for subsequent follow ups but unless you have nostalgia for it, or just really wanna play the original solitaire, there's no reason to go back to it. The Sting is a heist movie, where several con men try to con the man who's never been conned. Con-versely I hope you haven’t seen Oceans 11 because if you have then congratulations you've seen The Sting. Oceans 11 achieves everything that The Sting sets out to do in a more concise, well edited manner. The only thing The Sting has on Oceans 11 is it's old retro style charm, title cards appear after each act like older films, which is an odd tradition thinking about it. To anyone who claims that modern attention spans are low, just know that moves used to have breaks in them. Other than the scheduled potty breaks, the movie also utilizes a traditional, minimal editing style throughout the movie. Simple wipes are used everywhere, horizontal wipes, vertical wipes even some unique shapes that should never be used outside myfirstproject.mov. Judging by my review score you can tell that I am personally not a fan of this older style of filmmaking. My favorite directors consist of Edgar Wright and Steven Kubrick, directors that heavily utilize distinct and direct cuts creating a great sense of flow and cohesion with every film they make, older editing styles just don't have that.  There's a good movie just below the surface of The Sting, it's just covered in a thick layer of dust caused by age. With some polish, modern editing software and brighter color palette The Sting could be a good movie. Just spit balling ideas, set it in Las Vegas,  expand the cast a little bit, focus more on the plan and less so the execution and you have an amazing film. Wonder if any film like that exists...",

The scrutiny in here isn't as convoluted or glorifying as the makers think but is undeniably impressive and breezy to encounter which comes with cons too, like the characters never seems to be in trouble and has a way out of every calculated conflicts; primary reason why audience feels disconnected with the viewers. It is short on technical aspects like sound department, cinematography and editing although has amazing costume design and background score in its favor. The writing is weak yet gripping with varied tactics of heists that helps keep the audience engaged in it. The screenplay by David S. Ward pitches an impactful heist tale that is unforgettable in its own way. George Roy Hill; the director, has done a marvelous job on executing the script which could have easily come off as a hoax. The performance is decently acted out by Paul Newman and Robert Redford in their parallel roles and Robert Shaw in a supporting role. The Sting has a viscous bite that spreads like fire in a forest for despite of being loosely written it certifiably makes it entertaining.",
