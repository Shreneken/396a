    "summary": "Loosely based on the Starkweather-Fugate killing spree of 1958, Terrence Malick's debut features follows outlaws Kit and Holly from Fort Dupre, South Dakota to the badlands of Montana.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Where it\u2019s not refined in form, Badlands is so by virtue of the specificity of its material (the then-topical sensationalism of teenage sociopaths and their glamorization in popular culture), a fact that has been buried by the dense literature published on Malick. Yet the film never once feels like the faded photos Holly examines under her father\u2019s stereopticon.",
        "Badlands is the American myth of freedom and violence; it doesn\u2019t get old because it remains what we are.",
        "Badlands is as psychologically precise as it is splendidly visually observant. But it also exudes a timeless, mythical and tragic quality which is all the more remarkable for the languorous ease with which its story unfolds.",
        "Director Malick neither romanticizes nor condemns his subjects, maintaining a low-key approach to the story that results in a fascinating character study.",
        "Critics don\u2019t tend to talk about this much\u2014it\u2019s tantamount to a confession that we don\u2019t always know what we\u2019re doing\u2014but it\u2019s often the case that the most powerful, haunting aspects of a movie are those that we don\u2019t fully understand.",
        "A film so rich in ideas it hardly knows where to turn. Transcendent themes of love and death are fused with a pop-culture sensibility and played out against a midwestern background, which is breathtaking both in its sweep and in its banality.",
        "Badlands is a unique American fairy tale...and it's an impressive debut.",
        "Refracted through Holly\u2019s naive, emotionally flat narration and Malick\u2019s poetic visual style, this familiar tale is transformed into something strange and oddly beautiful. [29 Aug. 2008]",
        "The movie makes no attempt to psychoanalyze its Kit Carruthers, and there are no symbols to note or lessons to learn. What comes through more than anything is the enormous loneliness of the lives these two characters lived, together and apart.",
        "Achingly evocative of a time when Hollywood had the courage to invest in complex and morally ambiguous films and an indisputable masterpiece of American cinema. [26 May 2003]",
        "Among the great American crime movies, 1973's Badlands stands alone. [13 Feb. 1998]",
        "An unmissable, transcendentally beautiful classic. [28 Aug. 1998]",
        "One may legitimately debate the validity of Malick's vision, but not, I think, his immense talent. Badlands is a most important and exciting film.",
        "Badlands is about a landscape as much as the couple fleeing across it. Watching it, you sense that Malick finds his outlaw lovers beautiful and terrible, pathetic and monstrous, funny and overwhelmingly sad. [27 March 1998]",
        "The difficulty of humanizing killers without romanticizing them may present a challenging problem, but Malick showed it\u2019s not impossible to solve.",
        "This is largely another of Malick\u2019s impressionistic tales of paradise lost, but here the dreamy approach feels fresh and exciting.",
        "For all its lazy beauty, the movie is rooted in the personalities of its lead characters and they, unfortunately, are bloodless, affectless, emotionless dopes who turn their considerable lack of scruples on the business of senseless killing, for which they seemingly have no remorse. [13 Feb. 1998]",
        "There's a basic flaw in Malick's method: he has perceived the movie--he's done our work instead of his.  In place of people and action, with metaphor rising out of the story, he gives us a surface that is all conscious metaphor.  Badlands is so preconceived that there's nothing left to respond to. [18 March 1974, p.135]"

The fact this is his direct debut and how skillful directed is impressive. Best film debuts of all time.While a slow drift with it's pacing, but what keeps us so invested is two great performers from Sheen and Spacek, and the breaking taking cinematography. Like a feeling of peace. Not the type of characters you usually follow in a movie about love and freedom; love is strange.",

Exquisitely shot with a great premise and execution of that premise, Badlands is a film that suffers because of its writing. The acting is fine with Martin Sheen being the stronger of the two and completely embodying his character. Sissy Spacek was alright with moments of brilliance, but also moments where she struggled mightily. The costume design here is also quite good. However, back to the writing, the story is very good. It is well developed and interesting to watch unfold. Yet, the characters are terrible, as they act irrationally and nonsensically throughout the film. The dialogue is also horrendous and completely lacking any sense of reality. At no moment does this film feel authentic and that is due to the terrible dialogue and characters. While the story may be interesting, it suffers due to those two elements that really suck you out of the film. Badlands is probably Malick's strongest film that I have seen thus far, which is sad, because you can tell he is really brilliant, but he has no idea how to write a script.",

The makers beinga complex intake on simplicity..Badlands The feature never fails to surprise the viewers even at its vulnerable and mandatory stage and this is the strength of it where it shines utterly and flaunts with head held high. The makers being aware of the eerie and dark premise, keeps the tone light and breezy which is shot with amazing camera work in here but is short on technical aspects like sound department, editing and art design. The writing is smart, convoluted and even inedible for some audience at various places, which can be off putting especially when the complexity isn't narrowed down to a definite answer. Terrence Malick; the writer-director, as always, never disappoints on terms on executing his anticipated vision on screen with his keen sense of knowledge and passion towards cinema itself. The performance objective is where the wheels get stuck for despite of brilliant effort, Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek aren't as convincing as the script demands. The chemistry and the energy among the lead characters should have been explored more to connect with the viewers and offer them appropriate gravitas to it. Badlands is a complex intake on simplicity towards the emotion \"love\" that is set in a backdrop of this thrilling and somewhat overlong run.",
