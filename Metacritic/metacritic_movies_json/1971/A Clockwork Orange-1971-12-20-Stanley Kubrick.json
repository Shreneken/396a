  "critic_reviews": [
    "Ethical screed aside, what does A Clockwork Orange have to offer beyond its curiosity value and a crash course in humanism? Well, for a start there's Kubrick's dazzling visual style which, rather in the manner that Trainspotting did 25 years later, translates the substance of an \"unfilmable\" book into the language of cinema. And at the dramatic core of the film is a simply astonishing performance by Malcolm MacDowell as Alex. It also features an orgy sequence that would have had Von Stroheim laughing his jackboots off — you'll certainly never listen to the William Tell Overture in quite the same way again. And as for Singin' In The Rain...",
    "A chilling classic, the movie is a scabrous satire about human deviance, brutality, and social conditioning that has remained a visible part of the ongoing public debate about violence and the movies.",
    "If you watch Clockwork Orange and see that this is the game Kubrick is playing with us, giving us an avenue into understanding a corrosion of society, the film may be appreciated as his finest masterwork in a career full of them. Certainly, it’s his most human film, right next to Lolita in its refusal to judge its central character’s sickness.",
    "Kubrick's liberal, anti-authoritarian reading of Anthony Burgess's very Catholic allegorical novel is morally confused but tremendously powerful... No serious moviegoer can afford to ignore it.",
    "It demands thought, compels the attention, and refuses to be dismissed. And, for that reason, A Clockwork Orange must be considered a landmark of modern cinema.",
    "It is not a film the memory of which you will exactly wish to cherish. You may even, like me, reject the glib and icy pessimism of its message. But you will, I can assure you, find it difficult to put out of mind.",
    "A much-maligned and misunderstood classic, this is one of Kubrick's finest movies.",
    "It seems to me that by describing horror with such elegance and beauty, Kubrick has created a very disorienting but human comedy, not warm and lovable, but a terrible sum- up of where the world is at... Because it refuses to use the emotions conventionally, demanding instead that we keep a constant, intellectual grip on things, it's a most unusual--and disorienting--movie experience.",
    "The confounding thing, and perhaps the ultimate irony of Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, is that Alex is surprisingly but undeniably engaging.",
    "A Clockwork Orange ultimately asks: how deep is sin’s hold—on Alex, and on us? This being a Kubrick film—and considering that it leaves us with Beethoven’s Ninth triumphantly, transgressively ringing once more in Alex’s ears, after a fall from a window knocks the Ludovico out of him—the movie doesn’t seem to think humanity is worthy of an answer. To A Clockwork Orange, we’re all droogs at heart.",
    "His film may offend (it very nearly makes one nauseous) but there is no doubting the fact that it is the end product of a brilliant, highly original mind.",
    "Granted, the gratuitous nature of the hyper-violence is not for everyone’s stomach, including mine in moments. What is undeniable is the rigour to which Kubrick conducted his creative team, actors and himself to offer a new approach to filmmaking. As Burgess wrote in the novel “The colours of the real world only seem really real when you watch them on a screen” wholeheartedly matches Kubrick’s graphically engaging ninth feature.",
    "Flawed or not, it is a compelling thought experiment.",
    "A brilliant nightmare... The film employs outrageous vulgarity, stark brutality and some sophisticated comedy to make an opaque argument for the preservation of respect for man's free will - even to do wrong.",
    "The first punk tragicomedy, a chain-whipped cartoon meditation on Good, Evil, and Free Will that is as seductive as it is tasteless. That Kubrick misjudged the distance between comedy and cruelty seems to be unarguable.",
    "It still seems like a stunning achievement to this day.",
    "An engrossing, influential movie, which screams to be watched on the big screen. Few films will provoke your thoughts so fiercely.",
    "A sexless, inhuman film, whose power derives from a ruthless subordination of its content to the demands of telling a good story. A glossy, action-packed ritual which is fun to watch but superficial to think about.",
    "It is just plain talky and boring. You know there's something wrong with a movie when the last third feels like the last half.",
    "Let me report simply that A Clockwork Orange manifests itself on the screen as a painless, bloodless, and ultimately pointless futuristic fantasy...The last third of the movie is such a complete bore that even audiences of confirmed Kubrickians have drowned out smatterings of applause with prolonged hissing.",
    "A very bad film--snide, barely competent, and overdrawn--that enjoys a perennial popularity, perhaps because its confused moral position appeals to the secret Nietzscheans within us."

But I've given A Clockwork Orange more than a fair chance. To me, it just doesn't work - not just narratively, it doesn't even work thematically. It's essentially meant to be this very ambitious and intimate character study that reflects the flaws in the society and the present thinking etc etc. But the problem is, Kubrick never breaks into the psychology of the central character through the course of the film. He did so brilliantly in Eyes Wide Shut but here, I felt like a distant observer. I hated Alex from start to finish and I don't think it was meant to be that way. Even in Raging Bull, a film with the most despicable central character imaginable, eventually drew sympathy. That's because we got to know why LaMotta did what he did and it's done so powerfully. His penchant for self-destruction was just an exaggerated version of what everyone goes through - hurt oneself for causing pain to others. A Clockwork Orange doesn't even aim at the sort of depth.\rBut film does develop some ideas through the first 2 Acts but at the very end, it throws it all out of the window. Ambiguous endings work very beautifully with films like 2001 but here it felt like Kubrick himself couldn't make up his mind about the social norms. So then why make an entire movie about it?",

The twisted, sexually charged, not-so-distant future of England creates a world where evil runs amok. Yet in this dark world, where the protagonist of the movie (Alex) is one of the most vile, reprehensible people imaginable, Stanley Kubrick sets out with the herculean task of daring the audience to feel sorry for Alex. What's even crazier is that he succeeds! In spite of the gruesome murders and horrific rapes that fill the first act, I always find the second to third act of the movie where Alex has been brainwashed and is helpless the most harrowing part of the movie to watch. This film dares to argue that taking away an evil person's free will is more cruel than letting them commit evil freely. Without free will, good and evil are meaningless.

It's based on a book I have not read yet, I've never found it for sale, so I can not judge if it was true to the book. However, most people seem to have a consensual opinion that this movie is brilliant and one of the best ever made. It's a nuisance movie in its very nature, as it tackles too brutal themes. It basically speaks of extreme violence and the possible ways to control it through brainwashing and absolute control over people. It's a world that no one really wants to see. If violence is something we condemn, extreme violence is disgusting. The total conditioning of a person reminds us of the times of slavery and the man as object. These are ideas that our civilization, at great cost, has learned to hate, but we all won with it. These themes would make an excellent movie and this movie would have been great if it did not overdo it all through barbarically graphic and unnecessary scenes! And the film gets worse as it shows to the public plentiful bursting and destruction, accompanied - surprise, or perhaps not - by scenes of nudity and almost explicit sex. Stanley Kubrick filled the vast majority of his films with generous doses of blood and semen. He has always seemed obsessed with all this, and I am sure that Freud would make a rather interesting analysis of that, so why would it be different in his \"magnum opus\"? In the midst of all this monument to madness, we must recognize that the film tackles a complex subject and has an interesting history, although it is so abject that it ends up not worth the effort to watch. Perhaps in the future someone with courage will remake this movie in a more restrained manner, without exaggerate. We also emphasized Malcolm McDowell's excellent performance. The actor, still relatively young, went to the limit, accepting things that I, in his shoes, would not accept, and manage to maintained the interpretive level and shine. For this, he deserves congratulations.From the point of view of detail and technique, its possible that this is one of the best films ever made. But we are too shocked to notice and appreciate. And the truth is that cinema is not only technique. The audience does not fill the theater to admire the way the camera moves, the color and light of cinematography, the quality of characterization. The essence of any movie is the story told and, in this case, it's the story of a nightmare. Does the conception of a cinematographic work of art need, necessarily, to shock or cause erections? In the past, art was beauty and perfection, and I still think of art in that way. Does art now have to be deformed, sexual, pornographic and bloody? Is this art the pale reflection of our barbaric society or is merely the reflection of the apparently distorted mind of its creator?",

Of the 16 movies Kubrick directed (including his finalThroughout his 50-year career, and especially in his great films, director Stanley Kubrick had a penchant for taking the novels of others and re-shaping them to fit his own vision. Of the 16 movies Kubrick directed (including his final feature, Eyes Wide Shut), the film maker was credited with script involvement in 12 of them. For that reason, 2001 is not referred to as \"Arthur C. Clarke's 2001\" but as \"Stanley Kubrick's 2001.\" Dr. Strangelove is \"Kubrick's Strangelove\" not Peter George's. The motion picture version of The Shining owes a greater debt to the director than to author Stephen King. Similarly, the driving force behind A Clockwork Orange was more Kubrick than novelist Anthony Burgess.\r One of the first things that will strike anyone watching A Clockwork Orange today is how thoroughly modern it looks. If not for the presence of the youthful face of established thespian Malcolm McDowell, one could be forgiven the assumption that the movie was made far more recently than 1971. Unlike many of its contemporaries, A Clockwork Orange is in no way dated, and the issues it addresses are as urgent today as they were three decades ago. How many other films from the early '70s can make this statement?\r Part of the reason for the movie's contemporary look is Kubrick's forward-thinking philosophy of film making. From Lolita onwards, the director pushed the envelope. (In fact, one could argue that he did it before the 1962 film - overtly homosexual scenes from Spartacus were cut at the studio's insistence.) While human nature may not have changed since 1971, motion picture standards have. There is copious nudity, sex, and violence in A Clockwork Orange. And, while the sex is not pornographic and the violence is not explicit, they were pervasive enough to initially earn the movie an X rating. Today, the saltier elements of A Clockwork Orange fall into the mainstream of the MPAA's R category (and the film has since been re-classified as such).\r A Clockwork Orange is not an easy motion picture to absorb or digest. Oddly, the sex and violence are easier to take than the razor-sharp edge of Kubrick's satire and the corresponding awareness of its pinpoint accuracy when addressing the issue of the dehumanization of people. As I write this in 1999, the extremities of A Clockwork Orange have not come to pass, but society is slowly moving down the slippery slope that the movie cautions against. I have the disturbing feeling that if the solution to crime proposed by the film (brainwashing) was medically and economically feasible, the government would leap onto the bandwagon. When one character speaks of our willingness to \"sell liberty for a quieter life,\" it strikes an ominously familiar chord. Under its current mayor, New York City has yielded numerous freedoms in return for a reduction in the crime rate. And in Russia, the famished citizens would give up all their newly acquired rights for the promise of full bellies.\r Many have watched A Clockwork Orange without understanding what it all means. And for those who take everything presented on screen in a straightforward manner, a certain amount of confusion will result. But, like Terry Gilliam's Brazil, George Orwell's 1984, and other futuristic political satires, A Clockwork Orange is meant to be understood as part allegory, part black comedy, and part drama. The film takes aim at the ineffective and inhumane methods often devised by governments to stem criminal behavior, asking what sacrifices we're willing to make to live in relative security. Then there's the trickier question of whether the removal of free will destroys an individual's essential humanity. Does the State have the right to do this, to \"kill the criminal reflex\"? Would execution be a preferable fate? Finally, Kubrick illustrates the fickle nature of public opinion. Those that laud the government's methods one day revile them the next.\r A Clockwork Orange is not a pretty or comfortable experience. It does not pander to the crowd-pleasing mentality that shapes the structure of many films. (In that scenario, a Rambo-like Alex would have avenged himself upon all of his wrongdoers in the final fifteen minutes.) But it demands thought, compels the attention, and refuses to be dismissed. And, for that reason, A Clockwork Orange must be considered a landmark of modern cinema.",

Looking back, it's probably the year that I was introduced to the most great literary works of all my life (especially 'Anthem' by Ayn Rand and 'Nausea' by Jean-Paul Sartre). Included that year in the course's curriculum was Anthony Burgess' dystopian masterwork, 'A Clockwork Orange' (as well as George Orwell's 'Animal Farm'--like Frank Sinatra would have said, 'It was a very good year'). I was mesmerized with it from the instant I noticed the unique approach to language, the 'ultraviolence' and of course, the eternal question of free will, its relationship to good-and-evil, and the can of worms of the myriad of ethical dilemmas that comes to the fore of individual freedom and rights versus that of society at large. The genius of Burgess was being able to put so well and forcibly, yet in such an entertaining way, so many issues that, had most anyone else set forth on the endeavor, would have come up with the type of off-putting, heavy-handed sermon that would never have reached such a literary pinnacle, and been required reading even now, generations later. It hasn't aged or dated a day.\r Most cinematic observers felt the book unfilmable. Director Kubrick's adaptations work so well, particularly this, '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'The Shining' (even though Stephen King would fervently disagree about the latter) because he, as he did with 'Dr. Strangelove', can so easily both find unforgettable visual metaphors for his ideas and so handily combine humour (an under-recognized trait of his, much more readily associated with say, Sir Alfred Hitchcock) with these heavy and daunting philosophical and intellectual volleys. In the wrong hands (particularly a Stanley Kramer, or his ilk), this could have failed miserably, like typical cinematic treatments of Ayn Rand novels. But this worked triumphantly, and heartily exemplifies one of the greatest directors ever at the apex of his craftsmanship. No self-respecting cinephile can avoid this movie, and I heartily recommend you to read the novel as well, though Kubrick nails it so effectively, reading the novel isn't necessary in the slightest for the film to be enjoyed.\r One of the many 'gamechanger' films of Kubrick's extraordinary career.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThis is a film. A film that wants you to sympathize with a murderer and a rapist. A film that tries to justify criminal behavior. A film that tries to make a deep statement about society, but fails on every level.But, or course, people love to pretend that's not the case. They pretend that it has some \"deep meaning.\" That \"meaning\" is constantly thrown in your face every time you dare commit the sin of criticizing it.What is that \"meaning?\"Let's go through the plot and find out.The film opens up showing us Alex DeLarge and his four \"Droogs.\" They're in a bar called the \"Korova,\" which serves milk laced with drugs. They drink the milk and then start a night of debauchery. First, they beat up an old drunk man. Then, they beat up a rival gang in a fight straight out of a WWE match. After that, they drive to a house in the country owned by Frank Alexander, cripples him, and then rapes his wife. Keep in mind, we're supposed to sympathize with this character.After that, They go back to the \"Kodova\" where a woman sings some of Beethoven's 9'th. He strikes one of his droogs for jeering, stirring tension in the group. After that, he decides to call it a night. After Alex gets back to his apartment, he listens to Beethoven and masturbates to the thoughts of death and destruction. Again, we're supposed to sympathize with this guy.The next day, his probation officer comes to his house for a visit. Afterwards, he meets two women at a record shop and has sex with them at his apartment. When night comes, he meets his droogs in the lobby of his apartment building. One of them challenges Alex, but Alex asserts authority by attacking him. He later decides to rob a rich cat-lady. While robbing the house, he encounters her, and ends up killing her. He tries to escape, but his droogs turn on him and smash his face with a milk bottle, and he gets arrested shortly afterwards. Any sane person would be cheering at this point, but again, the film tries to make you feel sorry for the guy.Flash forward two years, and Alex, now in prison, is chosen to be part of an experiment. The experiment consists of being strapped in a chair, having your eyelids forced permanently open, being injected with drugs, and finally being forced to watch things you would normally like. During the experiment, he watches movie after movie of death, destruction, sex, and violence. All of this causes him to feel ill at the thought of sex and violence. To add insult to injury, one of the movies has Beethoven playing in the background, causing him to feel ill every time he hears his music.Afterwards, the effects are demonstrated to a gathering of officials. Remember the \"deep meaning\" i mentioned earlier? This is where it presents itself. It makes the argument that nobody should have their free will taken away, even when they've used it constantly to murder and rape people. I get where it's coming from, but it clearly could've used a better example. Instead, it gives us a guy who needs to have his free will taken from him.After the demonstration, he gets released from prison. He goes back to his parents house, only to find his stuff has been sold and his room is now rented out. He leaves, and encounters the old homeless man from before. He, along with his friends, beat the hell out of him. Two police officers break it up, and it's then revealed that the two police officers are his former droogs Dim and Georgie. They then take him to the countryside, beat the hell out of him and nearly drown him. Again, you should be happy this is happening, but the film WANTS you to feel sorry for him. It's honestly shocking and deplorable how much this film wants you to love a murdering rapist.He is then found by Frank Alexander, the man whom he beat earlier and is now wheelchair bound because of it. He accepts him into his home not knowing who he is. Later he hears him singing \"Singin' in the rain\" the song he sang while he raped his wife. Now knowing who he is, he drugs him and locks him in an upstairs bedroom. He blares Beethoven's 9'th, causing him to jump out of the window in a suicide attempt. He wakes up in a hospital with all his bones broken. He is given a psychological evaluation. Surprise surprise, he now doesn't have any aversions to sex and violence. The minister, who conducted the experiment, offers him a job at his public relations office. He then brings in a stereo system playing Beethoven's 9'th, which doesn't have any affect on him.In summary, this is a film that glorifies violence and tries to cover it up with a \"Deep message.\" It's amazing how defended this movie is when it's little more than a orgy of debauchery. Only positive things i can say about it is that it's well shot, and has a good soundtrack.",

Well, I'd like to think that waiting this long has made me appreciate the genius behind Kubrick's style a lot more than I would have 20 years ago.  Anyone who would read this has probably already seen the film, so there is no need to rehash the plot.  Instead, I want to specifically point out that Kubrick's consistent way of taking whatever twisted source material he is using to tell the story his way, no matter how much it may differ from the original, shows how incredible he was at not just choosing the right material, but filtering it literally and figuratively through lenses that show the viewer a little about what made him tick.  Yes, it may come across as intentionally shocking, but he does it without seeming like he is intentionally doing it.  He truly conveys a sense of artistic intent around his effort.  It's not just trying to tell the viewer a story, but showing, via film, the grittiest, most impactful way to experience that story to get the most not just out of the plot, but every nugget of crisp detail. By now I've read numerous articles about how Kubrick made his individual films.  A common message I get is that his genius and his end product is always thought of as top rate, but that those with whom he worked, even the original writers of the source material, conflicted with him.  He demands a lot of his talent, reduces them to their barest art and brings out the best in them.  This process isn't entirely enjoyed or appreciated by those with whom he worked, but I've seen a lot of films with the actors he uses and I cannot point to many, if any, efforts those actors do away from Kubrick that are better than the one they did with him.  Malcolm McDowell is as perfect in \"A Clockwork Orange\" as I have ever seen him.  His performance was raw, real, demented and just perfect.  I was astounded to learn that one of the creepiest, most disturbing element of the film was him singing \"Singin in the Rain\" while beating the writer and meticulously preparing to brutally rape his wife, was improved by McDowell and not originally called for in the scene.  The dichotomy of the brutal scene and the uplifting song amplified the creepiness of it all the more, proving that Kubrick had his actors right where he needed them to be.",

Due to a mix of immaturity, a lack of real-world experience, and being a mess of hormones teens tend to lack empathy and often act on their cruelest instincts or sexual impulses without any remorse. That's what gets portrayed here as we follow a high school aged gang leader as he and his fellow \"Droogs\" go around assaulting, raping, and commiting various other crimes against anyone they see fit simply because they can and it's fun for them.The film does an excellent job of capturing all the qualities of a teenage sociopath in its narrator/protagonist \"Alex.\" He's arrogant, manipulative, has no sense of guilt, spouts off borderline unintelligible jargon just like today's buzzword obsessed culture does, and when he finally receives some comeuppance from those he had harmed in the past he even has the audacity to play the victim. In an atypical move he's an intentionally unlikable, villainous, and downright evil focal character making for a unique viewing experience. All of this is brought to life by a fantastic Malcolm McDowell performance.\"He's enterprising, aggressive, outgoing, young, bold, vicious. He'll do.\"This naturally makes the moral of the story pretty murky. I mean, it's not like you can root for or sympathize with such a vile scumbag when he gets caught, jailed, and begins to experience the same kind of brutality he once dished out. Something I really struggled with when reading the book. Luckily, Stanley Kubrick made the message much clearer in this adaptation. This is a scathing critique of prisoner reform programs and the unethical practices going on behind the scenes that don't succeed at getting these kind of violent offenders to turn over a new leaf before releasing them back into society anyways, with some shots taken at governmental corruption along the way.As you might expect given the subject material being covered here, the content in this movie is quite harsh. There are fairly graphic displays of sexual assault and torture. Kubrick managed to make this watchable in spite of all that however by intelligently pulling his punches where he needed to and imbuing the whole thing with a rather cartoonish vibe. A clash between rival gangs, for example, plays out like something you would see in a Tom and Jerry short. Stuff such as the way the world is filled with erotic imagery meant to symbolize the lustful fixations of those in their pubescent years gives off a ridiculous and even playful tone that makes some of the more barbarous moments easier to sit through, but never to the point where it fails to acknowledge or represent the severity of them. This a borderline masterpiece and one of those rare examples of a film being better than the book it's based on, if only because it's themes have been made easier to decipher. The sole complaint I have that could be considered anything more than a personal nitpick extends to the rape sequences. These scenes thankfully cut off before reaching I Spit on Your Grave levels of explicit, but you still see restrained women getting forcefully stripped naked. The problem is that these parts feel rather **** as if Kubrick is unnecessarily throwing the exposed breasts and buttocks onscreen for some cheap titillation, which if that is truly the case would be disgusting given the context. Outside of that there's little to take fault with here. A classic for a reason, this is a one of a kind piece of cinema that provides a Looney Tunes gonzo look into the mind of an unrestrained juvenile delinquent with meanings that can still be dissected and discussed for years to come. It's practically mandatory viewing for anyone with a serious appreciation for the medium, regardless of whether you typically shy away from such hardcore offerings or not.9.2/10",

Although hailed as masterpiece and regular darling of the art house lovers, to me it's just a little bit messy, chaotic and pretentiously involved piece. The main problem as it seems to me is that, Kubrick here addresses issues of deeply political nature without clearly specifying his ideological perspectives, resulting in ambiguous and confusing work. Now the ambiguity might be welcomed in ethereal and metaphysical meditations such as \"2001\" but when targeting the political as he does here, it is irritating. Or, as Mr. Ebert said, \"The Clockwork Orange\" is ideological mess.",

The story itself is very interesting, showing us the daily life of psychotic high schooler. That alone is worth a viewing. This obviously Malcom Mcdowell best known performance, seriously try and think of another good movie he was in. He does this role so perfectly that you can't help but love him, despite what horrible vile acts he does. So what makes this movie so enjoyable is the main character and the journey he goes through, but what good is that without obstacles to overcome? From gang fights, rape, breaking and entering, and government experimenting. While each bit is interesting and entertaining, the experimenting is a bit confusing. While it is one of the most famous scenes, afterwards it causes a bit of confusion. I know that we get to see a lot of Karma finally pay off for him, but the overall message is a bit hard to determine. Supposedly he lost his will; figuratively, so that means he can't fend for himself, that sounds nice, but I can't help that the director was trying to say more but was lost. That doesn't matter anyways, this is still an awesome, brilliant, outstanding movie.",

I can't recall how many times I started watching it but never managed to last through to it's end credits. I'm not that squeamish, faint-of-heart kind of a person; but this film just pushes all the buttons for me in a most disturbing way.While I still think the first act is too long and too \"perverse\" for its own good, now after I've seen the rest of the film, I totally understand why it's often described as one of the most brilliant and exceptional dystopian films in the history of cinema. This devilishly thought-provoking futuristic vivid nightmare shows Kubrick at his most diabolically clever. I've never see such \"moral dilemma\" explored so intricately and craftily. I have no idea about Burgess's novel the film is based on, but what I can see, and admire, here is a prime example of how to explore a moral dilemma by expanding on it in a most creative and visionary way possible. Definitely my favourite screenplay written by Kubrick despite some overly-expository lines besides the aforementioned issue I had with the first act.This is absolutely one of my favourite Kubrick films and my favourite film that I'll never see again. I mean, who dare to revisit his scariest nightmare regardless of how colourful it is?!(8/10)",
