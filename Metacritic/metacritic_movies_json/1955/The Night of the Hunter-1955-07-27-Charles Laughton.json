  "summary": "A traveling preacher's (Robert Mitchum) nefarious motives for marrying a fragile widow (Shelley Winters) are uncovered by her terrified young children.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "It’s the most haunted and dreamlike of all American films, a gothic backwoods ramble with the Devil at its heels.",
    "This is the only film Laughton ever directed, and he packed it with a mixture of eerie chills, ingenious suspense, and absurdist humor. It's a genuine classic.",
    "Laughton understood Agee's proximity to Grimm vaudeville, and fashioned the most intensely expressionistic movie of its day.",
    "Part fairy tale and part bogeyman thriller -- a juicy allegory of evil, greed and innocence, told with an eerie visual poetry.",
    "One of the greatest of all American films, but has never received the attention it deserves because of its lack of the proper trappings. Many \"great movies'' are by great directors, but Laughton directed only this one film, which was a critical and commercial failure long overshadowed by his acting career.",
    "An enduring masterpiece--dark, deep, beautiful, aglow.",
    "A haunting, Aesop-like parable of good and evil, The Night of the Hunter is well worthy of classic status thanks to its wonderfully realised cast of Southern players, Walter Schumann’s dexterous original score and Cortez’s enrapturing, expressionistic visuals.",
    "Every frame of this film is brilliantly contrived, particularly the underwater nightmare at the end. A gripping, complex chiller.",
    "The Night of the Hunter is nearly as demented as its lead villain, and I mean that as a compliment.",
    "Unforgettably haunting images (a car submerged in a watery grave; a spider's web view of the children fleeing in a riverboat to the strains of Pretty Fly; a silhouetted angel of death) make this a perennially unsettling masterpiece from which modern chillers could learn much.",
    "Perverse yet remarkably life-affirming, Night of the Hunter may be the best film ever made about spiritual perseverance.",
    "Hunter is the stuff of nightmares, but it’s the stuff of dreams, too, and it beckons you to follow it downstream.",
    "Beautiful, haunting, poetic, and intensely personal, THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER is a unique, terrifying masterpiece.",
    "From its guileless exposition and comically life-drawn Americana, to its Scripture quotations and sensitivity to a child’s perspective, the film proceeds with a simplicity of inexhaustible depth.",
    "Ignored for a long time, this film is now impossible to ignore. Mitchum is magnetic.",
    "Although The Night of the Hunter offers many pleasures for students of film history, its ability to captivate a generation for which its qualities are so foreign is as much an indication of how degraded film literacy has become as a counterargument to the movie’s timelessness.",
    "There is a strong trace of Freudian aberration, fanaticism and iniquity. Credit Mr. Laughton with a clever and exceptionally effective job of catching the ugliness and terror of certain ignorant, small-town types.",
    "This start for Gregory as producer and Laughton as director is rich in promise but the completed product, bewitching at times, loses sustained drive via too many offbeat touches that have a misty effect."

Good acting, good story, good movie. this is film making at it's very best. A suspenseful masterpiece. there are moments where i am actually worried that he would catch the kids. An excellent film. I particularly like how he would fool his victims and their friends. He has more or less memorized the basics of Christianity and he uses that for his own ends. He is so evil that you like him a lot. also I like how this was Laughton's first attempt at directing. It was his first time and he came up with this. the only other time that I have seen that is with Citizen Kane. A masterpiece that will never fade into the ages.

There are shadows and silhouettes that seems like it shouldn't be there, but that's to give the scene feeling and saying what's going on and a character's mood.

Robert Mitchum's performance as the shadowy, terrifying Reverend Harry Powell is a reason to watch this movie alone. Love and hate tattooed to his knuckles, it is almost more terrifying to see him work his way into becoming a loved member of the community than it is to see his dark and murderous side unleashed. He haunts the screen with his presence, the shadows of his iconic hat and cheery sing-song lacing itself with the sinister undertone of his intent.Fantastically scored and directed, and with one of the most terrifying and iconic villains of classic cinema, its no wonder that this film is rightfully revered as one of the all time greats, and with time may solidify itself as one of my all-time favourites.",

By knowing the words of the Bible, Lucifer can easily trick people into thinkingThey say that Satan knows the Bible just as well as God, for he uses its words to trick believers and people of the world into following a path of destruction. By knowing the words of the Bible, Lucifer can easily trick people into thinking his voice is that of God and that his words are godly ones. Unfortunately, far too many people fall for this trickery and are led astray. It is in this world that a film such as The Night of the Hunter is born. One where a Preacher is the antagonist and with good reason. He is a cruel and evil man whose only goal is to find money stashed away by a bank robber on death row. He uses his position as a Preacher to find favor with the townsfolk and the man's widow. All that is standing in his way is a couple of kids sworn to secrecy by their father.Moving in the shadows to try and woo their mother and the townsfolk, Reverend Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) is a truly brutal man. Arrested at the beginning of the film for being in possession of a stolen car, he is a wolf in sheep's clothing, sent to lead the righteous off the right path. He talks the talk and shows everybody he knows the Bible, but behind closed doors, he is ruthless. From murder to theft, this is not your father's Reverend. Instead, he is a manipulative and evil man that is deftly portrayed by Robert Mitchum. In my recent forays into older classics, I have become well acquainted with Mitchum and it is hard to see him playing so against type because, inherently, I want to root for him. Mitchum is a terrific actor and The Night of the Hunter really stands as a testament as to why that is the case. He chills the room by simply entering it and his dark figure seems to tower over all of those in his presence. He simply radiates evil and makes the perfect guy for this role as a false prophet. By casting Mitchum, it makes the audience immediately comfortable with Harry Powell, just as the townsfolk are considering his status as a preacher. However, we quickly see Mitchum's brilliance as he turns on a dime between God fearing preacher and the ruthlessly greedy soul he hides within.As a tale of religion, the film is incredibly strong. On one hand, we have the wolf in sheep's clothing and on the other, we have Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gash). A woman of faith, she takes in both John (Billy Chapin) and Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce) - the children who Harry Powell tries to trick into giving him the location of their father's money - as well as other children. Though rejected by her own son, Rachel takes in children rejected by their parents or who are orphans and gives them a loving home. Reading often from the Bible and instilling a fear of God in her children, she stands as a beacon of light in the film and the true embodiment of faith. In the Bible it states, as Harry Powell quotes from Matthew 10:34, \"Do not assume that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.\" Rachel, though bringing peace and happiness to this children, is defensive. When she catches wind of Harry's presence and finds out he is not John's father, she immediately defends her home and her children with a gun. Reasoning that this is a harsh world for small ones, she puts herself in harms way to defend the children in her charge against a brutal enemy. In its entirety, the Night of the Hunter is a deeply spiritual affair. It boils down to a man of evil fighting a woman of purity. He is the equivalent of a Holy War on Earth between the left hand of hate and the right hand of love and turns out exactly as illustrated by Harry Powell throughout the film with love conquering hatred.Its tale of morality is not just limited to the main characters either, as even the Hangman (Paul Bryar) suffers greatly from his job. In hanging the children's father Ben Harper (Peter Graves), he once more finds himself grappling with the weight of his job and being unsure of its justification. A man who's job it is to kill people for the state may just be a job, but what is its impact on his salvation? Though working in the coal mines would likely kill him, he constantly expresses his regret over his job and wishes he had stuck with coal mining. It is a compelling debate and one that the film introduces with grace alongside its main story that raises a lot of questions. Is it better to die young and leave your family to fend for themselves or is it better to be the man in charge of hanging convicted criminals with blood on your hands? The answer is certainly not one that anybody would have a quality answer for.As a film noir, director Charles Laughton heavily uses shadows, silhouettes, and lighting to create incredible cinematography. The highlight of the bunch being a shot of Harry Powell riding along the horizon on his horse. Silhouetted by the moon, the two young children can see him from a distance and can hear him singing. With the moment filled with tension due to its ominous presence, the film demonstrates how a simple",

I went into this knowing only the small plot description (the same one above the paragraph), and certain shots that I have seen around on social media through film related sites. What surprised me the most is how uncomfortable and eerie the movie is, which at first, I wasn’t sure if it was just me that was experiencing this. But when it finally clicked with me, then I knew I was in for something...interesting. The character Harry Powell, an evil charlatan preacher who takes advantage of anyone in his sight, played brilliantly by Robert Mitchum. Mitchum is terrifying and the whole “preacher” thing is just a character he puts on to trick people. He talks with a strong commanding southern voice that makes his preachy words easily take control of anyone in his presence. Powell would do anything to get his filthy hands onto some money, even going as far as marrying the children's mother, a naive widow (played by Shelley Winters) who was hoping for some happiness in her life with Powell, but she's only a part of his scheme of things. He is the big bad wolf with a hypnotizing singing voice. There’s no other way of describing him; he’s just an evil son of a **** I will never forget that terrifying Satanic roar from the monster called Harry Powell.Even if people haven’t seen the movie, but some may recognise the famous tattoo of 'L-O-V-E' on his left hand & 'H-A-T-E' on his right hand, where he tells an animated story of love and hate through his hands. The most visual way of showing love and hate at war with each other and I can see where director Spike Lee got the idea for the Radio Raheem scene in ‘Do the Right Thing’.A great supporting performance from Lillian Gish as Rachael Cooper, a religious woman, who unlike Harry Powell, practices what she preaches and has a hard as nails, no nonsense attitude, but also shows a loving and caring nature towards the already traumatise children. If you want a strong female character that shows you that they are strong rather than telling you, then this is it. If you come around looking for trouble, then you better kiss your ass goodbye and say hello to a barrel of a gun when it’s pointed at your face by Mrs. Cooper. The scenes between her and Powell were the most fascinating aspects of the movie. This is the first and sadly only feature film directed by Charles Laughton, which is a tragedy that he never made another movie after this, because the fact this is his first stab at a motion picture, as he was mostly a stage and screen actor, is beyond impressive.The cinematography by Stanley Cortez is excellent and Gothic, as he gets to play around with the lighting and shadows, especially one shot of a wheel of a car at the bottom of the river with a dead body in the vehicle, with the blonde wavy hair dancing gently in the water, which made it look like a painting of a Gothic fairy-tale, while it also feels strangely peaceful, but very Brother’s Grimm. I would imagine this must have been shocking for people back in 1955, the same how it’s still shocking today. The River Boat scene is another sequence that’s just candy to the eyes. What the movie does so brilliantly is how it makes you feel the sense of danger, even from a distance. There were a couple of times when I said “wow” at certain details and how it was executed. Movie magic baby! Overall rating: A marvellous mix of beauty and horror. Go check it out! It’s great!",

Gregory gave the directorial responsibilities to his friend Charles LaughtonThe strange fact-based story about “Reverend” Harry Powers, written by Davis Grubb, was turned into this equally strange film by first-time producer Paul Gregory. Gregory gave the directorial responsibilities to his friend Charles Laughton and the task of adapting the screenplay to Pulitzer Prize-winning author James Agee (AKF: “A Death in the Family “anautobiographical novel). Laughton claimed part-writing credits but this has been heavily disputed since the finding of Agee’s original screenplay - showing the film to be shot as written by Agee. While Laughton has chosen to give his 1955 film (set in the 30s) the look of something that may have been produced in the silent era – he sometimes adds the odd unintentional laugh – these come via curious characters dotting the equally strange sets and situations. It was also evident Laughton had trouble with the kids.  Perhaps the real power of this bizarre work should be credited to Director of Photography Stanley Cortez. Cortex has fused the film with striking visual atmosphere - adding an ethereal mood to the already dark story of a psychologically deranged ‘preacher’ serial killer. Whoever called the shots, between the two of them, they certainly left us with a haunting visual treat – who could ever forget the long blond hair flowing within the river currents, intertwined with the long wisps of river growth!  The casting of stars from the silent era also gives the film an older look but there are undoubtedly many superb scenes to be enjoyed throughout this, at times, unsettling story. There’s an effective music score by Walter Schumann along with an odd casting choice of Mitchum as the hideous ‘reverend’ but at least the horror elements were subtle and not in-your-face like the current cheapies some have become used too.",
