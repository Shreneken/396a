  "critic_reviews": [
    "Almodovar is adept at weaving together strands you'd never guess would match.",
    "Almodóvar's masterwork, is a spectacular synthesis of everything that has always interested him -- proud women, lovely boys, beautiful drag queens, grand movie stars, gorgeous frocks, wild wallpaper .",
    "Funny and wise, lively and contemplative, intriguingly postmodern and powerfully moving, all at the same time. It's not to be missed.",
    "So intrinsically rich that it doesn't need any metaphors.",
    "It weaves life and art into a rich tapestry of love, loss and compassion.",
    "A surprisingly satisfying combination of bawdy sexual humor, genuine emotion and a plot with mechanics so excessive that Almodóvar himself calls it \"a screwball drama.\"",
    "As straightforward and plot-driven as any movie about life imitating art imitating life could possibly be.",
    "Just about everyone worth knowing in All About My Mother is female in spirit, which is to say they're all sexy, impossible, powerfully durable souls, quarrelsome and loyal, inventive at navigating the tragedies.",
    "It's filled with marvelous performances, fabulous wit, and some dizzying images.",
    "Almodovar still populates his work with characters you'll see nowhere else in movies.",
    "Some will find the movie's sexual antics too explicit and unconventional for comfort.",
    "The characters have a weight and reality, as if Almodovar has finally taken pity on them--has seen that although their plights may seem ludicrous, they're real enough to hurt. These are people who stand outside conventional life and its rules, and yet affirm them.",
    "A tender genuflection to the women's energies that keep that spinning world from keeling over.",
    "Almodovar imbues his Harlequin-novel-meets-Marvel-comic-book melodramas with something more than a wink and a smile, and it's beguiling.",
    "As dark as a Greek tragedy yet it has a vibrance and joie de vivre that can't be contained by grief.",
    "It's enough to make your head spin, but Almodovar, whose mastery of the medium has never been more assured, gives you plenty to think about, ultimately grounding the dizzy whirl of his idiosyncratic fictional world in a story that feels not just true but universal.",
    "For me it felt like a good many weeks at a politically correct summer camp, though the talented actors--including Cecilia Roth, Eloy Azorin, Marisa Paredes, Toni Canto, Antonia San Juan, and Penelope Cruz--certainly seem to enjoy the taste of the characters they're playing.",
    "The unfettered comedy of life bubbling up from the Spanish unconscious continues to be proudly liberationist, gloriously extreme, and achingly human.",
    "Even though the film is full of laughs, the jokes hover on the edge of the abyss: This is a world in which lurid colors and extravagant gestures are means of filling the void.",
    "An emotionally satisfying and brilliantly played take on the ups and (mostly) downs of a group of less-than-typical female friends.",
    "No one else makes movies like this Spanish director.",
    "Classic melodrama given a thoroughly modern, utterly Almodovarian face-lift."

Well, I definitely felt with the characters - the emotion was very real from all the actors, especially Cecilia Roth and Marisa Paredes. However, the story itself leaves me with so many questions, something that I am used to have answered in Almodovar's films. Or maybe that's a new development, since I have seen all of the films that came after this one, before I have watched All About My Mother.Either way, it is definitely worth watching and the excellent acting and music (typical of Almodovar's works) make the film something one ought to watch. So yes, a very good film, somewhat confusing and question-provoking, but ultimately good.",

The first film I have seen by Pedro Almodovar, All About My Mother still has me excited to check out the rest of his filmography, but this one is definitely flawed. A melodrama that is certainly partially an homage to films such as A Streetcar Named Desire and All About Eve, All About My Mother is a moving, tragic, and heart wrenching experience. With themes of parenthood, death, AIDS, transsexuality, and  faith, the film is an undeniably powerful experience. However, with a rushed ending and other moments of brevity throughout the film, All About My Mother loses some of its impact along the way.Starring Cecilia Roth as Manuela, a grieving mother who recently lost her son, but has a mysterious past, the film explores her life after the death of her son. The film is an excellent exploration of her character and as she travels to find her son's transsexual father, Lola (Toni Canto). Never having told Lola she had a son (and named it Esteban, which was Lola's past name), Manuela travels to Barcelona, but meets a cast of characters along the way who alter her course. The purpose of the film may be to find Lola, but it spends far more time exploring Manuela's interactions with actress Huma (Marisa Paredes), transsexual prostitute Agrado (Antonia San Juan), and the HIV-positive and pregnant nun Rosa (Penelope Cruz). In the process, it explores the aforementioned themes and the stereotypes that perpetuate them.Regarding AIDS and transsexuality, it is clear that there is an opposite reaction after the initial repulsion. People certainly look down upon both HIV-positive and transsexual people (even now) and All About My Mother captures this element. Yet, the film shows how people then have differing reactions to both. For those who are HIV-positive, such as Rosa, people are repulsed and want nothing to do with her. Her own mother, once Rosa gives birth, wants nothing to do with the child for fear that she will become HIV-positive as well. For transsexuals, they are still repulsed, but there is an inherent curiosity to this repulsion. Per Almodovar, people may not like transsexuals, but they find the blending of male and female private parts to be compelling and entirely erotic. The film shows how transsexuals must overcome these sexual advances to become what they really are: regular people who just happen to deviate from the norm.The film blends these themes with themes of death and of faith. With Manuela's son dying and others dying from AIDS in the film, it is clear that death permeates the film. Through the melodrama, Almodovar wrings every possible ounce of tears out of the crowd, but he does lose some impact by skipping over death. He expects us to put it together, which we clearly can, but just hearing about it and seeing them die is entirely different. In this vein, the films brevity hurts it with these powerful moments losing all emotional impact due to his approach. With regards to faith, the power of God is ever present in this film. With His ability to heal highlighted toward the end, the film's thematic dealings with faith are clear through the presence of Rosa. A pregnant and HIV-positive nun, she is positively shown despite the juxtaposition. Selfless and willing to help people wherever needed, Rosa highlights the best of Christianity and, even if she has slipped into sin, there is forgiveness for her at the end of the day, even if her family is unwilling to accept her. For Almodovar, it is clear that faith is important in this film, but character triumphs all. Just because you are religious, it does not mean you are without sin, but your character means far more than any sins you may have committed.A powerful melodrama, All About My Mother has a pretty poor ending where Almodovar just jumps ahead in time, losing all emotional impact, and just tells us what happened to characters. We see Manuela leave and come back after two years in five seconds, which is incredibly jarring. The film, in an attempt to cover its characters in greater depth without making the film longer, skims along at the end. For such a good film beforehand, it is disappointing to see Almodovar shorthand the ending and wind up crippling the final product. That said, the tremendous acting, writing, compelling themes, and unique colors and art direction, make the film a good one. I certainly hope my further exploration of Almodovar's filmography yields more enthusiastic results, however.",

Although all of them were from very good to outstanding, this was one of my favourites, and for good reason, as it is obvious that Almodovar was on quite the roll.

Then, it seems to abandon what it set up, and begins to liberate itself only to unveil, little by little, its rich and intricate tapestry of femininity and maternity. Through a growing web of female characters, All About My Mother celebrates female solidarity as we see each one shows right in time to rescue the other from the brink of collapse by creating emotional bonds between one another to fill in each other's gaps and get each others to complement their missing halves. Stupendous performances from all around, but I was struck, in particular, by Cecilia Roth's bravura performance as the lead character Manuela. The emotional range she shows is impressive and the entire movie she seems as if her eyes locked in tears, ready to fall anytime her son is brought up in any conversation. These scenes show how inextricably linked her complex feelings of haunting grief are, as she mourns Esteban's death and her being bereft of maternity at the same time. All About My Mother is also a panorama of vivid colours and moments of 'joie de vivre' that keep the film light on its feet while bolstering its tribute to actresses as well as its female spirit. Crazy how All About My Mother winds up giving perfect closure to the relationships between the characters and the themes it explores after getting carried away a bit too far now and then.",

It features a good cast (including Cecilia Roth and Penelope Cruz) and I liked the cinematography, showing the seedier sides of Barcelona. The plot intrigued me - its certainly a good bit of social commentary, Given the plot, it may have been, if only somewhat, controversial when it came out in the late 1990s and I respect that its a well liked and regarded films. I liked and respected that the women looked out for each other. I suppose it has the feel of a play about itI certainly enjoyed watching it, so yes, I'd recommend it.",
