    "critic_reviews": [
        "Has a shameless B-movie exuberance.",
        "Engagingly silly sub-\"Moonlighting\"-style banter.",
        "Jean-Claude Van Damme's latest dud.",
        "Lightning fails to strike twice -- an underwhelming follow-up to one of the career-stalled action star's better efforts.",
        "Must have been slapped together fast: live-action stunts created by uninspired editing lead up to computer-generated imagery that's just as lame.",
        "Devoid of personality and has an annoying gratuitous sentimental streak.",
        "The Return is about bullets, bombs and boobs - the biggest boob being Van Damme, natch, but there are also mammaries aplenty.",
        "Plenty of bone-crunching brawn, but not a brain cell in sight.",
        "Custom-made for an audience of mouth-breathers.",
        "Slow-moving and violent mess...feels slow even at a scant 82 minutes...Even by the slack standards of Van Damme's oeuvre, \"The Return\"  is a letdown.",
        "A mind-numbing exercise in high body counts and big tits.",
        "Lame, mindless dialogue makes Wing Commander seem Cukoresque by comparison."
