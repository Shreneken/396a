    "critic_reviews": [
        "One of the best films of the year thus far.",
        "Heart and tenderness are rare in cartoon movies. But in an age of frenetic children's fare, the new animated adventure The Iron Giant dares to show a lot of both, and it comes up a winner.",
        "It's an antidote to complacency.  The question is, whom is it trying to wake up?",
        "Bird's movie neither panders to children nor sneers at them, and it beautifully, lucidly captures the giddy adventurousness of childhood.",
        "At times, The Iron Giant is more serene than it needs to be, but it's a lovely and touching daydream.",
        "One of the best children's movies in years. Spunky, inventive and filled with life and wonder.",
        "Surprising as it sounds, as far as examinations of trust, loyalty and identity go, the big metal dude's story winds up far more satisfying than the plodding Kubrick opus any day of the week.",
        "An unpretentious, funky, fast-moving work every bit as enchanting as the book.",
        "Both a step back and a step forward from the trends of modern animation, it feels like a classic even though it's just out of the box.",
        "Despite its p.c., humanistic overtones, the film manages to integrate the humor and action of a kid\u2019s adventure tale and the message of a political allegory without beingheavy-handed.",
        "Clearly the single best, the single coolest (to borrow from Harry Knowles) animated film in a great while.",
        "An animated tale equipped with heart, humor, blazing action and not a sappy song in earshot.",
        "Keeps its sense of humor while dealing with serious issues.",
        "Not just a cute romp but an involving story that has something to say.",
        "Still, the movie -- as beautifully drawn, as sleek and engaging as it is -- has the annoyance of incredible smugness.",
        "A smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking.",
        "A terrific feature-length cartoon.",
        "A smart live-and-let-live parable.",
        "A rare adaptation that actually improves upon the original material: It's everything a good children's adventure tale should be, and a powerful fable for adults.",
        "This is not exactly standard children's fare, but kids (and their parents) should be smitten by its wit and wisdom.",
        "Remarkably unassuming, genuinely playful, and superbly executed, The Iron Giant towers over the cartoon landscape.",
        "Director Brad Bird (TV's King of the Hill, The Simpsons), adapting the original children's book by the late British poet laureate Ted Hughes, has created a wonderful character in the huge childlike visitor from space.",
        "More intelligent and thought-provoking than the usual dumb and dull-witted fare for children.",
        "We are happy to report there is intelligent life in feature animation beyond planet Disney and the gaseous ball of foul language known as South Park.",
        "A solid, not to say ironclad, winner in the less than overcrowded family animation arena.",
        "This remarkably clever, often hilarious animation derives much of its humor from its satirical view of the 1950s.",
        "The kind of uplifting film families can enjoy without any reservations.",
        "An E.T. spin-off, but it's a very likable and imaginative one.",
        "In most respects, The Iron Giant is one of the better animated children's films in recent memory, which makes its strident political correctness all the more frustrating."

To say this film is anything less than one of the preeminent animated films of our time is to do it injustice. I do not believe any movie has been able to so deftly weave in a message as powerful as this one with a kid-friendly animated story. For a film about a \"giant metal man,\" The Iron Giant is anything but mechanical. This film, interestingly enough, explores topics very relevant to modern American foreign policy, despite its setting in 1958 during the Cold War when tensions were high with the Soviets. The Iron Giant portrays the US as a highly expansionistic, militaristic nation with interventionist tendencies, playing off of the common beliefs about nuclear war at the time. However, it manages to do so subtly enough that it never feels like it is preaching to its audience- while there is a powerful anti-war sentiment towards the end of the film, it doesn't go so far as to insult the military or degrade the nation as movies tackling this issue tend to do. And then, it even works as a sci-fi film, grabbing the attention of the audience from the get-go with an exciting, mysterious opening scene. Sci-fi? Politics? Family values? This movie has got it all. Hogarth (Marienthal), the protagonist, is an eleven-year-old child with a widow for a mother who has no real friends from school, and often entertains himself outdoors as his mother (Aniston) tries to earn a living. At first, the character almost seems annoying due to his mannerisms and chatty personality, but over time, it becomes apparent that he is absolutely a realistic portrayal of a child who has been left to his own devices, but is undeniably kind and gregarious in nature and who is only looking for companionship (and a father). Throughout the film, the audience is given more backstory to who he is and this allows us to empathisize with him, making the climax that much more gripping. The giant also manages to become an endearing character as the movie progresses, with subtle voice acting talent from Vin Diesel himself. I belive it is safe to say that this is the best thing Vin Diesel has ever done. That goes without saying- in fact, picking him to play the giant with a limited vocabulary ironically gave him the opportunity to be the most affecting. The Iron Giant's incredible relationship with Hogarth evolves as a classic story of friendship that is both organic and believable. A brilliant edition to the cast comes from Harry Connick, Jr., who plays the beat generation hipster Dean. His role is the shining star of the film. He could easily have been underplayed or overly clich\u00c3\u00a9d, as his character description would allow for either scenario, but fortunately his dialogue, delivery, and place in the story are so well thought-out that he never has the chance to flounder. Equal parts emotional and hiarious, Dean completes the triangle between Hogarth, the giant, and himself. The last character to finish off the cast is the wonderfully headstrong, slightly crazy and progressively aggressive government agent Kent Mansley (McDonald) whose choices throught the story ultimately lead to the powerful climax. Dislikable in the best way, Mansley represents everything that was bad about the McCarthy/Red Scare era in US history. I keep mentioning the movie's climax, but it's for good reason. At first the conclusion seems contrived, but the brilliance of its execution helps overcome this fact. The last 20 minutes will stick with you for days afterward. Of course, the animation is top-knotch as well. The hand-drawn environments and character movement, as well as voice-to-mouth alignment, make this a visual spectacle that can be referred to as nothing less than art. The sountrack compliments the visuals as well, rounding out the AV experience. In conclusion, I believe that this remains Brad Bird's genre-defining masterwork to date and will remain his best piece unless he somehow outdoes what is essentially perfection. Ratatouille and The Incredibles were fun, but they can't possibly measure up. In fact, I'd say most Pixar films would even find it difficult to compare themselves, mostly because, aside from Up, none deal with adult themes like The Iron Giant. Your biggest competition remains Miyazaki's epic, Spirited Away- and for that, I applaud you, Mr. Bird. You should be honored to be in such impressive company. You've got the Western front covered. Verdict: Movie Win",

ThisBrad Bird's big-screen directorial debut is a simply magical film. It preserves the central themes of the Ted Hughes novel on which it is based, but makes them far more hard-hitting by transporting the story to the USA in the 1950s. This period of extreme paranoia at the height of the Cold War, with the fear of nuclear attack ever on people's minds is the perfect setting for a story about the darker side of human nature and loss of innocence, and allows for a healthy amount of satirical humour and 1950s sci-fi references. The film is a real visual feast, with flawless animation that seamlessly blends hand-drawn characters and environments with CGI elements. The voice cast are superb, with Eli Marienthal emotionally grounding the story as Hogarth Hughes, the lonely, good-natured and endlessly curious young boy who discovers and befriends the titular giant when he crash lands on Earth. Vin Diesel, though voicing a character of few words, imbues the giant with a childlike innocence, and perfectly conveys the sense of sheer horror as he discovers his own origins. Jennifer Aniston probably gives the performance of her career as Hogarth's exasperated single mother Annie and John Mahoney is the perfect casting choice as the patriotic but highly moral General Rogard. The real cast highlights are Harry Connick Jr.'s beatnik scrapyard owner and wannabe artist Dean, who provides most of the comic relief, and Christopher McDonald's federal agent Kent Mansley, who makes an extremely entertaining antagonist. What really makes The Iron Giant work is the balance it manages to maintain between the comic and the serious. There are loads of great gags it's true, but there's also some extremely dark observations about the Cold War state of mind (then there are the scenes that are both funny and serious at the same time, such as the creepily cheerful instructional video telling school children what to do in the event of a nuclear holocaust). You'd have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by the film's finale, with Hogarth and the giant's relationship so well established, and with the addition of Michael Kamen's beautiful, highly emotive score, be prepared to shed the tears. The film feels equidistant between E.T. and King Kong, but is better than either. To dismiss it as simply a film for children would be moronic. The Iron Giant can speak to everyone, no matter your age or background because Brad Bird is a great storyteller and introduces you to characters you can relate to and actually care about, and the moral of his story is universal. The Iron Giant isn't just a brilliant animated film, it's a brilliant film, end of.",

Browsing through films, The Iron Giant caught my eye. I could only hope that I enjoyed this film as much as I did Ratatouille or The Incredibles. The verdict is that the film wasn't was good as either Pixar films, but is more than exceptional entertainment. In fact, this is one of the best non-Pixar animated films I've ever seen. The film opens with a gorgeously animated sequence of a futuristic vehicle flying through space, until it lands in the middle of the ocean where a boat sails nearby. The captain of the boat stares curiously where he saw the flash of light...then a giant 50-foot robot emerges from the ocean. The film only gets better from there. A young boy named Hogarth is at the diner where his Mom works long hours. The boy overhears a conversation about the Iron Giant, and wonders if it truly exists. His question is later answered when he sees the robot near a power plant, and ends up saving the giant's life. The two become friends, though the boy has to hide the giant to avoid the government (and his Mom) from finding out (Think E.T.). The film is quite funny, and it's filled with stunning animation and memorable characters. The story matches up to Pixar quality, in both heart and substance. There are a lot of tricky issues that are discussed in this film; death namely. The Iron Giant is curious about Earth, and one of his experiences is a deer being shot by hunters. The Iron Giant is traumatized by the experience, and Hogarth explains death as well as he can. \"Death isn't a bad thing,\" Hogarth says, \"Everyone dies.\" \"You die?\" The Iron Giant asks. \"Well, yeah, someday.\" Hogarth says. \"...I die?\" The Iron Giant ponders. \"I...don't know. Maybe...\" The film is very thought provoking, and in some of it's many humorous scenes, laugh provoking. It's even a little tear-jerking at times. If you understand or appreciate anything about movies, this film should be viewed as a must-see. Something you have to experience at least once.",

It is such a shame though how the film as a whole was a finical failure, but don\u2019t let that put you off.\r Full Review\rThe main features about the Iron Giant that makes it stand above the crowd are the story and characters. At first it seems a very stereotypical children\u2019s film, with the main character (Hogarth) being the unfortunate, bullied, kid at school who them befriends an iron giant. Furthermore the similarity to E.T is unavoidable, and it could be argued the iron giant is a less emotional version of E.T, as the story for the most part is basically about the relationship between a boy and an unknown creature, while the government try to find the creature. However when the film introduces the villain (Kent) who is sent to investigate certain incidents within the town, the story picks up as Kent becomes more determined to find the giant, and Hogarth must hide him, leading to a game of cat and mouse occurring. Furthermore unlike typical children\u2019s films, where the villain is so obviously evil and a bit dull, here Kent\u2019s position is sort of understandable, as his determination to gain recognition, and his fear of the unknown drive him on, while he is restricted by governmental powers. The combination of believing motivates and restricts on his power, make Kent an excellent villain. Likewise while Hogarth can be boring and stereotypical at first, this changes when he begins his interaction with the Iron Giant, because the relationship between the two is excellently portrayed, as Hogarth tries to restrain the Giant\u2019s power, while at the same time trying to have fun with his own Iron Giant. For me this makes the relationship between the two far more plausible than the relationship between Eliot and E.T, in E.T. Likewise Hogarth nature of being a little bit rebellious while not being a really annoying character, as his maturity further help to place the film higher than its competition.\r The story and characters are made less stereotypical, with the introduction of difficult issues, such as fear of the unknown, teaching something wrong from right in a contemporary setting etc.  However these questions are balanced with elements of heart-warming comedy, whether it is the childish nature of the Giant, the creative imagination of Hogarth etc. help to soften out the moral elements of the film. It certainly makes a nice change from the countless children films that focus only on love/romance.  Such features help to make the Iron Giant a breath of fresh air.\r The excellent story and character portrayal are all enhanced by the excellent voice acting. In particular credit has to go to Christopher McDonald voicing Kent who really provides a nice balance of normality, crazy levels of determination, frustration, and a consistent level of evil. Likewise Vin Diesel voicing the Iron Giant works fantastically well, because his deep voice combined with the lack of spoken dialogue gives the Giant lots of depth.  For me the overall sound of the movie was great as there was a minimalist sound track with hardly any songs, but everything, from the water effects, to the explosions, fit right in to the overall effect and feel of this outstanding movie.\r The only major drawback to the film, decides the things you would expect (dated looks, and plot holes); is the lack of the development of the sub-characters. While lack of development does not affect Dean I particular, the characters that feel under-developed are the General and Hogarth\u2019s mum Annie. Now while the general is not in the film for a long period of time, so his under-development is understandable, the fact that within the film he holds the power of Kent means that by him being barely featured, when he does exercise his power it is not as impactful as it should be. The same sense of under-development affects Annie, who despite being a key character seems a bit unaware of what is going on, and like the General, despite playing a key role as Hogarth\u2019s mum, is not featured enough.\r However, I would still recommend this film to anyone because it is charming and a lot of fun, despite its short comings. A must see.",

The film is about a giant metal machine that drops from the sky and frightens a small town in Maine in 1958, only to find a twelve year old friend named, Hogarth, that ultimately helps him finds its humanity and saving the towns people from their own fears and prejudices.\rThis original childhood film has a simple, but more than satisfying plot line that is fun and intriguing for children and adults leaving an emotional attachment to this giant metal man while bringing you light to a particular moral or ethic. Its beginning starts as any other science fictional movie with this seems to be crater falling from space and landing into a random location on earth where just so happens to be a civilized area to saying their goodbyes and leaving the planet, but not the same ordinary goodbyes as you would think. Its composition was beautifully executed throughout the movie in a comprehensive manner that still upholds the story. By that I mean the order of the scenes of the film were well done and each one needed, in order for the movie to be shown in a understanding way to children and adults. The film has an excellent cast that voice-over the personalities to give these 50's animated characters more of a realistic understanding how and why they react and contributed given their time period at which the events occurred much like Disney Pixar's animated film, \u201cWall-E\u201d given that film didn't have many voices, but could still deeply feel the emotion within the characters. This great film portray events as they are in real-word settings. The actions and interactions were to be believable, plausible, and at least somewhat relatable to both child and adult.",

The setting, the time period provide a nice backdrop for the story of a metal ET crash landing on earth. We have the Americana version of Maine during the Cold War and a young boy, Hogarth who is basically your everyman as a child. He is precocious and adventerous. He owns a BB gun, he loves his comic books and wants to have a wild animal for a pet. His mother is your typical single mom... or rather a widow (it was not well-established how she lost her husband and I only discovered this after referring to the Wikipedia site) and works at a diner. She is patient, long-suffering with her child's antics and his many other quirks which altogether come out of the stereotypical screenplay bag of basic ideas here. Into Hogarth's life comes this Iron Giant and from there, it plays out like ET. I know this is a kid's movie yet after hearing and reading the great reviews, I found myself wondering how this film could belong to numerous top ten film lists. I kept forcing myself to keep watching, expecting some depth or revelation. Yet Hogarth, his mom, and Dean, an artist who owns a scrapyard were all poorly written characters. The bad guy was boring and idiotic. The climax was overblown and ludicrous. The whole plot offered nothing new. The dialogue felt clumsy and trite.    A pleasant film and I suppose great for children. Weapons are bad. Killing is bad. Yes, wonderful moral messages here along with the idea that we choose to be what we want to be. The film just felt bland and boring, more a chore to watch. There are far better animated films out there. I urge people not to believe the hype. Brad Bird directed this work and it is definitely a first film for him. I recommend The Incredibles which is much more mature and a far better film. It was more well-thought out than this piece of juvenelia. This felt like a sketch that needed more attention to detail. I truly don't understand the rave reviews. Sometimes I think the herd mentality is at work in movie criticism.",

It's a film with animation that still looks breathtaking nearly 20 years later, it's a film that handles mature themes of death and relationships in a way that'll have you think twice about the idea of \"all animated films being kiddy flicks,\" it's a film that's hilarious but also exciting, it's a film with brilliant characters like the charming Hogarth, the witty Dean, and the sinister and complex Mr. Mansley, but most importantly, it's a film that shines through with its title character, the Giant himself, a character that's both badass and adorable, and easy to love. It's a film that has stood the test of time, and it's a film that deserves to be watched not only by fans of animation, but by fans of films in general. It's a true masterpiece of filmmaking, and if there's anything I can criticize, it's that it took me until now to finally watch the film. Don't make the same mistake I did.

There wasn't a single thing I hated about the movie, for me it was outstanding on every level. The animation was absolutely gorgeous, with stunning colourful backgrounds and brilliant character animation especially on the Iron Giant himself. The music by Michael Kamen was consistently excellent, and never overpowered the story. In fact at times it even enhanced the drama. And the film has a beautiful message not to mention a sweet story. The characters were delightful, Hogarth isn't annoying at all and the Iron Giant isn't scary in the slightest. Strictly speaking he has to be one of the most gentle and poignant characters in an animated film. There are plenty of effective scenes like the explosive climax and the scene with the dead deer is a real tear jerker. I will admit I was worried initially when I saw the voice cast, but everybody involved did a superb job. Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jnr were perfect, in their most understated performances. Both get stick about being untalented, but for me their vocal contributions in this film suggests otherwise, while Christopher MacDonald almost steals the film as the FBI agent. Eli Marienthal is very sweet and likable as Hogarth too, and watch out for John Mahoney and Cloris Leachman. All in all, an outstanding film, that if you mind me saying so is the best animated film of 1999 and one of the best films of that year too. I may be wrong but I do think it is highly underrated on IMDb. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Children will love it and adults\"The Iron Giant\" is a fabulous animated feature, funny, touching, vivid and, best of all, humane. I hated it.\rIt's brilliantly animated, and like the masterpieces of its genre it transcends age groupings. Children will love it and adults will be transfixed by its cleverness and its deft satire.\r The movie is set in 1957, in that immediate post-Sputnik panic, when it appeared that we were behind the Russkies and had to catch up. One night in upstate Maine \u2013 this was before the giant alligators of \"Lake Placid\" got there \u2013 a fireball crashes into the sea and the one survivor of a fishing boat sunk by the splash claims that it was a spaceship!\r Later that same week, cute Hogarth, the son of the perky diner waitress, is wandering around, curious about a weird phenomenon: Something has been biting chunks out of tractors. Aliens or commies? Well, the giant footsteps in the mud suggest the presence of a 100-foot-high robot. Hmmmm. Hogarth bumbles into the woods exactly when a 100-foot-high robot is trying to eat the local power station and is about to be electrocuted for his hungers. The boy doesn't run screaming in fear \u2013 as would any kid in a '50s movie \u2013 but instead takes pity on the screaming giant and locates the power station's helpfully placed OFF switch, thereby saving the big guy's life.\r What happens next is sort of like a Lassie movie with a 100-foot-high robot with nuclear weapons in its arms in the role of the collie. Boy and 'bot gambol through the woods, developing a touching relationship. They \"bond.\" Boy is not stupid; he understands that some people might be made anxious by the presence of the 100-foot robot that eats cars for lunch. He helps 'bot hide by taking him to the junkyard \u2013 this would be a Horn & Hardart for a giant metal-eating robot, no? \u2013 which is run by the local beatnik artist. Meanwhile, his perky mom is trying to figure out what to do and a manly FBI agent, just like the one James Arness played in \"Them,\" arrives to investigate.\r Technically, \"The Iron Giant\" is superb. Brilliantly colored, it meshes computer-animated imagery (the robot and most of the war machines) with the more fluent and naturalistic stylings of the old Disney house style. It's \"Bambi\" with robots. The dialogue is sprightly and engaging and the off-screen actors \u2013 particularly Eli Marienthal as Hogarth, the boy, and Jennifer Aniston as his perky mom \u2013 are terrific.\r But at a certain point \"The Iron Giant,\" without missing a beat in charm or artistry, skews off into TULWC. And that would be The Usual Left-Wing Crap. I suppose the movies it is parodying would be considered TURWC, but they were made in the middle of the Cold War. This one was made in the toasty-warm safety of our victory in that war.\r The artistic conceit of \"The Iron Giant\" is to invert the stereotypes of the '50s invasion-from-space movie, with its paranoid, xenophobic overtones and anti-communist metaphoric structure. Think of it as \"The War of the Worlds\" or \"The Thing\" as directed by a member of the Hollywood 10. As I say, TULWC.\r Thus the FBI agent turns out to be a treacherous rat, not a hero; it's the beatnik who gets the girl (Mom) in the end, while the FBI guy runs away like a sniveling craven monster. When the authorities arrive, it's the usual liberal fantasy of the military, an agglomeration of trigger-happy, destruction-crazed yahoos willing to blow away the gentle giant just because he has A-bombs up his size 347 sleeves. Those rats! If they showed him love, this wouldn't have to happen.\r Okay, you're saying: Who wrote this review, \"Strangelove's\" Gen. Buck Turgidson? Still, the movie \u2013 as beautifully drawn, as sleek and engaging as it is \u2013 has the annoyance of incredible smugness. It is, one could say, blinded by the hindsight. How stupid the '50s seem from our enlightened age, yet how utterly easy and cheap it is to affect superiority to that decade, particularly when nowhere in the piece does it acknowledge the existence of an evil empire busily nurturing spies and building H-bombs and threatening to bury us after burying millions of its own. This movie is set in '57, but nobody affiliated with it appears aware of what happened in '56, in Hungary. Yes, I suppose the makers of \"The Iron Giant\" are morally superior to the FBI, CIA, USAF and USN and USA agents, soldiers and officers who fought the Cold War, but it's easy to be superior when your dads have already beaten all your enemies.",

Such animation features are always a passion projects which is clearly visible in here and is also the primary reason why it creates the impact like on other usually does. It is rich on technical aspects like cinematography, background score and editing. The animation speaks volume more than the words in here and as far as the script is concerned, it may follow a familiar format extracted from the textbook formula, but is undeniably an effective, impressive, charming and emotionally beautiful feature. Tim McCanlies and Brad Bird; the screenwriters, have created a cozy and warm environment that is perfectly balanced on delivering the entertainment to both, its younger and older audience. Brad Bird; the director, is on his A game for the emotions projected in here creates a deeper impact on the viewers and connects with the frame to frame with his brilliant execution skill and a knack for pleasing the viewers through its amazing visuals and camera work. The voice given by the actors seems apt especially by Vin Diesel as The Iron Giant, Jennifer Aniston and James Gammon.

The cadence of this movie is spectacular it flows beautifully and there is no fluff in the entire film. The emotional bonds you set with characters, especially the giant, is amazing and adds so many layers of depth. Every character is crafted so beautifully you feel the emotions that they feel and even the antagonist you can somewhat sympathize towards. The visuals are phenomenal and I never felt like I was watching a movie made 20 years ago ,and what Bird does with the color schemes is spectacular.  The lens in which you watch this movie is through the innocence of a kid, but Bird is not afraid to tackle real issues like the Cold War, death, violence, and even the state of our US Army. The emotions you feel is immense from the joy you feel with Bird's visuals, the anger you feel towards the antagonist, the fear when meeting the giant for the first time, the laughter from the witty dialogue, and finally the sadness when the giant sacrifices himself. This movie does have its fair critiques, but I truly felt a journey when watching this movie; when I finished the film I had chills that I had not felt since watching Forrest Gump. Coming from someone that isn't the biggest fan of animated films, this is personally up there with some of the greats like shawshank or empire as one of the best movies I have ever laid eyes on.",

It does have some appealing, an emotional plot and a good ending, but, for me, it stays at 8/10 because I feel I have seen this type of movie before. A kid that founds \"someone\" that is very unusual or big, no ones believes him. Then people discover that he does exist and are afraid can be harmful, so they decide to eliminate him. Then at the end, that creature confirms he is good and it's a happy ending. So it was very predictable for me, but it doesn't mean it was bad. Another thing is that it let me with some questions like, where does the robot come from? How does he understand so well English, or even speak? But I think that the movie let that to the audience to think.I recommend this movie to a family with kids, you will enjoy it for sure!",
