    "critic_reviews": [
        "I haven't been so captivated, chilled and surprised by a movie in years.",
        "The 11-year-old Osment evokes the boy's terror and awful predicament so memorably, you'll never forget him.",
        "(Osment) delivers what may be the greatest performance ever by a child actor.",
        "Perhaps the most startling part is the realization that, in the turn-off-your-brain season of summer, you've just experienced an uncommonly serious-minded movie that's brave enough to engage our deepest emotions on issues of death, madness, illusion and forgiveness. That's the biggest thrill of them all.",
        "The filmmaker keeps upping the ante with surprises until the plot-twist beaut that concludes the picture - a shocker that, upon reflection, is probably the one ending that wouldn't have fallen a little flat.",
        "An unnerving and astonishing thriller.",
        "It's a psychological thriller that actually thrills.",
        "Teeters on the brink of New Age ludicrousness, but it never goes over: Like Kieslowski and others, Shyamalan knows that what makes for lousy metaphysics can make for powerful metaphor, and in the end he creates a deeply, surprisingly affecting film out of a little bit of smoke and brimstone.",
        "So disarmingly eerie it's virtually guaranteed to rattle the most jaded of cages.",
        "Eventually writer-director M. Night Shyamalan neutralizes Willis's star presence with impressive plotting that's a fine excuse for the powerful atmosphere.",
        "Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan lets the tension rise slowly, leads you everywhere you don't expect, doesn't rip you off and totally freaks you out -- all without stale effects or gore.",
        "Works best when it works its mournful magic alone, without fanfare, using only the flickering fear in Cole's gaze as it meets the compassion in Crowe's.",
        "Sometimes verges on silliness.",
        "If this isn't the single best performance ever by a preadolescent male (Osment) in a motion picture, then it's tied for whatever is first.",
        "Has a kind of calm, sneaky self-confidence that allows it to take us down a strange path, intriguingly.",
        "Ultimately affecting mix 'n' match weeper.",
        "Ultimately, it has less in common with \"Blair Witch\" than with such quivering lumps of sentiment as \"Ghost\" and Field of Dreams.\"",
        "Although the film occasionally descends into mawkishness, Shyamalan is skilled at bringing the tension to excruciating heights.",
        "It's like an enema to the soul as it probes the ways of death ? some especially grotesque in a family setting. You leave slightly asquirm. You know it will linger.",
        "Unfolds with a patient intelligence. The Sixth Sense might not scare you out of your wits, but it could reward them.",
        "A metaphysical shaggy-dog story, whose unpredictable punchline is its only redeeming feature.",
        "Borderline dull to sit through, The Sixth Sense is actually rather interesting to think about afterward because of the revelation of its ending.",
        "At least tries to disturb us, rather than shock us or gross us out, and that is admirable. But it doesn't pull it off, and the movie is indicative of the trouble Hollywood has these days making that most frightening kind of movie -- the kind that lets the audience frighten itself.",
        "The thriller's best and worst features all stem from a highly unusual plot structure that builds to a genuinely startling conclusion.",
        "The flashy sensationalism of The Sixth Sense -- maybe the best thing about it -- is at war with its desire for contemplation.",
        "Complain all you want about Willis's posturing and the rabbit-in-the-hat ending (predicated as it is on a vast plothole), the film is still a rarity, a studio horror movie focused on a child's traumatic stress.",
        "Buried deep inside this ponderous, repetitive psychological thriller is a fantastic half-hour \"Twilight Zone\" episode.",
        "An inferior product. It is not well written, well acted, or well directed.",
        "The biggest piece of supernatural hooey since estranged wife Demi Moore's \"The Seventh Sign.\"",
        "Because the movie never fully engages us, it never quite manages to allay our queasiness about watching the boy's distress.",
        "Because it unfolds like a garish hybrid of Simon Birch and What Dreams May Come, with some horror-movie touches thrown in to keep us from nodding off, \"The Sixth Sense\" appears to have been concocted at exactly the moment Hollywood was betting on supernatural schmaltz."

Night Shyamalan's may be the downbeat responsible for the deluge of twist endings that eventually consumed his - now infamous - filmography. However, what \"The Sixth Sense\" also does outside of its game-changing final reveal is simply tell a compelling story. In fact, the plot threads and characters in play are so frightfully addicting to watch that I knew full well what the twist was going in and I still had an unmitigated blast seeing everyone get to that final, cathartic revelation. This is a rich, jet black study of death and the macabre, the dangers of psychological trauma and isolation, the raw power behind human regret and reconciliation, and how all the aforementioned thematic devices can influence one another in life. It really is a carefully-constructed, laser-focused achievement in cinematic storytelling, with a stunning collection of lead performances (especially from that of young Haley Joel Osment) and, yes, a wallop of an ending. Make no mistake though, this didn't make over a half of a billion dollars because of its final two minutes. Indeed, with \"The Sixth Sense,\" it's all about the journey. For me, the destination, seems like a footnote in comparison to all the beauty at hand throughout this one.",

It is difficult to say much more about The Sixth Sense without spoiling the finale for those that have not seen the movie (although there can't be many people who are unaware of how the film ends) but it certainly is one of those rare films that is almost better when watched for the second time when you know what to look out for. As for the cast Bruce Willis puts in another good acting performance but Hayley Joel Osment steals the show in, what I believe, was his movie debut making for an almost perfect movie package.",

It is a beautifully made film with an afterlife that is anything but angels and harps, and the score has lots of subtlety and atmosphere to it. The script is chilling, intelligent and poignant and the story complete with a knockout twist ending(easily the best and only wholly believable ending of Shyamalan's movies) is simplicity at its finest. Shyamalan's direction is wonderfully controlled, which is exactly what the story needed. Haley Joel Osment gives perhaps his best performance here, though he's superb in AI too, while Toni Collette plays the troubled mum very convincingly and Bruce Willis is suitably quiet and reflective. Overall, a wonderful film and Shyamalan's best by a mile in my opinion. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

For some reason during a second viewing I was so much more absorbed and engaged, especially on an emotional level. The characters, plot, direction, and acting are all so extremely well done. The only complaints I have about this movie now are that the scary scenes really aren't that scary and occasionally a little silly. Also, you're going to have to be in the mood for a slow paced ride. But those are just nitpicks in the face of such an extremely well constructed, written and acted film. I'm so confused now about how Shyamalan made The Happening, but this movie shows that he has undeniable talent in him.",

Well directed by M. Night Shyamalan, this one manages to be scary, touching, and above all, incredibly entertaining. There are numerous scenes here that manage to do all three, but above all, I found this film to be incredibly moving. A study of ghosts (and what they want), as well as the mind of troubled children, The Sixth Sense manages to really move its audience in a truly unexpected way. I did not expect to be practically moved to tears by this one, but there I was, fighting back tears towards the end. Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, and Toni Collette, are all great here, especially Osment who really shows how talented of an actor he is. It also underscores how sad it is that Shyamalan lost his magic touch, since this one shows so much talent. Truly a great film, The Sixth Sense is another top-notch entry in what was a fantastic year for film in 1999.",

It's not clear whether this film is at times trying to be actually scary or is simply hightening the tension, with half jump scares and some sketched attempt at a scary soundtrack. I don't see how people call the final \"revelation\" (and note the inverted commas) a \"twist\", when it was clear from twenty minutes in what the situation was. Maybe, as I said, standards have been lowered so  much that people go see thriller movies with their brains turned off. To put the icing on the cake, everything is whispered in the hopes of giving dialogue depth, obviously failing.\r Anyway, not everything is terrible: the idea is brilliant on paper, and it was supported by somewhat decent performances by Bruce Willis (we don't get to say that often) and Toni Collette.

Night Shyamalan trying to compensate for his script's narrative shortcomings with an audacious twist ending that is illogical and does not make sense. Sound familiar? The atmosphere is built effectively enough for some chills, but the narrative is poorly thought out and meandering, and completely undercuts what suspense Shyamalan creates.

Plus it doesn't feel like a gimmic just to make the movie interesting. When you watch it a second time it all makes since. That's clever directing on Shyamalan's part. But the actually movie delivers just as well. Haley Joel Osmont is fantastic as Cole. Bruce Willis was good, but there were moments that felt like he was just acting. Toni Collete is also fantastic as Cole's mother. The way the story moves is very engaging and compelling all at the same time. It didn't feel like those typical generic horror movies. The characters and situations felt real, and you really care about them throughout. However there were two scenes that while good, I felt didn't really need to be in the movie. But it's still a fantastic movie to watch. Overall, it's a compelling thriller. I give \"The Sixth Sense\" an A!\" Be sure to check out my YouTube channel, \"LittleMovieBoy\" for more reviews.",

The acting, direction, music, and execution are all very, very well done, and there are some extremely powerful moments throughout the film. Especially the ending, which is hinted out throughout the film perfectly. The revealing of the final twist (don't worry, no spoilers) is all over this movie, and, in that aspect, Shyamalan pulled off the ending in such a genius way. The script is so well written, considering the twist actually does work and make a bunch of sense.\rWhile there are some flaws, like how every single word people say is whispered and is said...slowly...so...slowly. At times, it works and creates good atmosphere, but, at other times, it is just kind of annoying. But, after a while, you begin to just flat out get used to it.\rThere are some scenarios in the film that feel like they would work more in a really, really dark comedy, and, I have to admit, there are a couple of unintentionally funny moments in the film. But, don't worry, the film doesn't have too many of those moments, I mean, there's way more great moments than bad ones.\rOverall, \"The Sixth Sense\" is a great horror film that is a bit more than just a horror film. Watch it, it has a very smart script and, on a technical level, the film is very well made.",

Like all filmmaker should. But I think his is so particularly specific that he cannot help carve that piece of pie in a slow sensual way. That delicate touch. It is important to him. Important for exploring a sensitive subject as such. Accepting your fate. What you are. And it is something that everyone finds it difficult to go through. And it is also something everyone has to go through. Now the reason why people find the experience difficult or horrifying, if I may, is for the obvious element of surprise. Ergo, the writer and director, M. Night Shyamalan's debut horror film isn't just a drama or a horror but also mysterious.The suspense is exhaustingly intense. You'll be sweating. And a huge amount of credit goes to the emotion that shadows each characters and the performance that overshadows that very content. And in lead, Haley Joel Osment is the surprise package whose empowering bursts are nuanced and jaw dropping. For instance, when he runs away from the situation or the condition he is trapped in, a kid is to, has to express his fear.And mixed with his fear, the pseudo effect is him tearing down, sobbing with the expected fear, the awareness of the tragedy he is doomed to live with. Maybe that is why he is the hero of this tale. He has already accepted his fate. He is ahead of other characters. All he is doing, is waiting for them to catch up, along with us, the audience. And is also why he is sensible and mature considering his age. The Sixth Sense has all five senses heightened up for the cinematic experience, awareness, fear, acceptance, medicinal help and communication. A key for a good socially functional family that our protagonist is about to start.",

Night Shyamalan completely gave up! The Sixth Sense is among the greatest writer-directorial debuts in cinema history, building chilling suspense while simultaneously possessing a plethora of genuine heart.When it comes to storytelling, The Sixth Sense really shows Shyamalan drawing inspiration from Hitchcock, and it works to near-perfection. It\u2019s a slow-building, character-driven thriller that leads the audience down the same path of discovery and tense fright that is experienced by those on screen. A great deal of the exposition is non-verbal, relying instead on subtle visual clues and clever foreshadowing that make for a much more personal, intellectual viewing experience. Shyamalan trusts his audience and it\u2019s always so refreshing to see a film like this.This splendid pacing is pulled off thanks to fantastic editing and direction that always aligns the audiences\u2019s perspective with that of the characters. The spine-tingling score from James Newton Howard and gripping, raw dialogue further anchor the narrative in reality and it sucked me in. I was hooked from the opening scene and was deeply invested in the personal struggles of these people.While by no means perfect, The Sixth Sense is a gem of supernatural horror.

This movie is really good. I still haven't seen other M. Night Shyamalan movies besides a film he wrote called \"Stuart Little\", but oh boy, does he have a great sense of direction in this film. And although I really like the directing and tone of the movie, I got to say the best thing about \"Sixth Sense\" is the child actor's performance, Haley Joel Osment. He was great in \"Artificial Intelligence\", but here he delivers one of the creepiest performances I've ever seen. This is partly because the timing of his lines' delivery is impeccable. Usually in movies, kids would rush delivering their lines, but Osment is not one of them. Not only does he have excellent timing, he also expertly conveys the character's emotions in a way that feels genuine and believable. Bruce Willis is almost overshadowed by him, but that's not to say that the former is bad. Bruce Willis is pretty great in this movie, demonstrating charisma and making his character more sympathetic.Unfortunately, I couldn't fully experience this movie, as someone spoiled the twist ending for me, but the final scene still was very resonant and dare I say, a tear-jerker.Overall, the movie was not perfect. There were some scenes that dragged on for too long and there are some inconsistencies with the ghosts mystery. However, it's still a film that I and many others enjoyed.8/10.",

Many people claim Unbreakable to be his best film till date, but for me, as much as I love Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense will always remain as the best Shyamalan had to offer. ..Good : It's his masterpiece. Shyamalan has never been better. What does it not have? Emotions, drama, character development, storytelling, great writing + directing, all of it. Willis does a really good job. It is perhaps the first time I saw him in a role like this, one of the best examples of casting against type. The arc of the child played by Osment and that of Willis have been given full justice. Seeing them help each other overcome their problems and fears in the way they did was very good. There are some emotional moments which hit the right notes, all because we have known the characters very well. We get a happy ending for the kid, and while expecting something similar for Willis, we get the infamous twist. The first time I watched it, I was blown away. It feels kind of obvious having it watched so many times now, but man was it incredible! Bruce was dead all the time. This made me analyze some parts. Bruce died with the bullet on his abdomen, and in a scene where he is getting out of a flower shop seeing his wife with another guy, he is clutching the exact place where he was hit. And in every scene after he was shot, his interactions with his wife feel and are obviously him talking to her, but her talking to herself. For a first few views, it is unnoticeable. And, it doesn't even feel that way. Also, Willis is not interacting with physical object. What I thought of a plot hole in the first few viewings were actually genius writing and directing. And I would also like to talk about the horror aspect. It's something I call genuine horror. There are creepy stuff going on and you don't know what is actually happening. It's not a horror movie but has got the elements perfectly. And of all the emotional parts, the final moments after the twist hit perfectly. I wonder why this wasn't an Oscar worthy film. ..Bad : Not necessarily bad about the film. But Shyamalan was called the next Spielberg after this film. His next great film was Unbreakable, followed by Split. Split was good, but nowhere near the former two, which was leaps and bounds better than Signs and Glass. And besides these, I don't even want to name the rest of his disasters. I still think he can make real good films, but comparing most of his films, I sadly feel that he was no Spielberg but just a one hit wonder. ..Conclusion : It's the greatest Shyamalam film ever. Unbreakable is a close second. Those who think Shyamalan didn't have any potential must watch this. It is just that Shyamalan must have stayed this way. Also, any thriller fans out there? Watch this immediately, if you haven't watched it. ..Rating. ..Score : absolute 10/10Grade : golden A+",

While the film may not be as scary as some of its contemporaries, it instead delves into themes of grief and redemption. The infamous twist may have been revealed countless times in pop culture, but it remains a significant moment in cinematic history. Even though Shyamalan may have peaked early in his career with \"The Sixth Sense,\" the film's lasting impact stands the test of time._______________________\"El Sexto Sentido\" es un thriller cl\u00e1sico que a\u00fan se mantiene 20 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su estreno. Las actuaciones destacadas de Bruce Willis y Haley Joel Osment, junto con la cinematograf\u00eda innovadora de M. Night Shyamalan y los huevos de Pascua caracter\u00edsticos, crean una pel\u00edcula escalofriante y que invita a la reflexi\u00f3n. Las seis nominaciones al Oscar que recibi\u00f3, incluido un gui\u00f1o por el papel secundario de Toni Collette, son un testimonio de su impacto desde el lanzamiento. Si bien la pel\u00edcula puede no ser tan aterradora como algunos de sus contempor\u00e1neos, en cambio profundiza en temas de dolor y redenci\u00f3n. El giro infame puede haber sido revelado innumerables veces en la cultura pop, pero sigue siendo un momento significativo en la historia del cine. Aunque Shyamalan pudo haber alcanzado su punto m\u00e1ximo al principio de su carrera con \"El sexto sentido\", el impacto duradero de la pel\u00edcula resiste el paso del tiempo.",
