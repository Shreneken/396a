    "critic_reviews": [
        "Children of Heaven is very nearly a perfect movie for children, and of course that means adults will like it, too.",
        "Though Majidi draws from familiar Iranian sources, he's made something unique and moving: a sweet tale with a stirring finish.",
        "This modestly produced family drama has all the poignancy and humor associated with today's vibrant Iranian film industry.",
        "This is a pellucid and gentle film, made with the simplicity and grace of a children's tale and yet its humour, emotional clarity and directness speak directly to adults and children alike - and the pre-teen principals shoulder an adult burden of performance.",
        "Majidi masterfully balances the serious subtext with entertaining vignettes.",
        "Children of Heaven is a simple film \u2013 it has bold, childlike colors and a narrative that turns on unremarkable, everyday events \u2013 yet Majidi and his young actors invest it with such basic truth about the inner lives of children that the movie feels as big as the universe.",
        "One problem leads to another, but because the children's points of view are so powerfully rendered, the plot of this elegant and lightly magical-realist 1997 drama never seems merely coincidental.",
        "Much humor and suspense is wrung from incidents that would be minuscule from anything but a child\u2019s p.o.v., many repeated until they become ingenious running gags.",
        "The poverty that is at the heart of the situation is in prominent relief, yet there is a happiness about their lives that defies sheer gloss. Here is a brother and sister who truly love each other and are bonded by their complicity.",
        "Haunting in its charm, Children of Heaven opens a window on both contemporary Tehran and the hopeful heart of childhood.  This lovely, amusing film deserves a big audience -- especially families. It touches on the innocence of children with tremendous affection.",
        "Certainly the youngsters in Children of Heaven respond well to the direction of Majid Majidi and give off emotions and thoughts in such an unmannered way that many proper actors could learn loads.",
        "In Children of Heaven, life is sweet despite countless hardships, and no reality beyond the economic intrudes upon a fairy tale atmosphere. Only through heavy-handed emphasis does the quest for new sneakers take on any greater meaning.",
        "The plot feels less like a realistic dilemma than it does a willed exercise in neorealist catharsis \u2014 a way of inviting Western audiences to bask in their materialist \u201dempathy.\u201d",
        "Clumsily staged (a bike accident any 15-year-old Super-8 maven could\u2019ve cut better), lit like a soap opera, and acted with all the bribed relish of a peanut butter commercial, Majidi\u2019s movie is merely the simplistic bid being made by every national industry impatient for mass audience attention. Gallingly, it may succeed."
