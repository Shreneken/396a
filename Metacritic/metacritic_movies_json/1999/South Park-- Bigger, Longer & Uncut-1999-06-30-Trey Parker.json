  "critic_reviews": [
    "Turns out to be the funniest, most risk-taking, most incisive movie of the summer.",
    "Parker jams South Park with so much comic \"stuff\" that the effect is dizzying, at least for those who haven't left the auditorium in a huff before the end.",
    "This isn't just the most riotously inventive movie of the year, it's the raunch anthem of the age.",
    "It's a gas, dude!",
    "Bigger, Longer & Uncut will make it harder still to dismiss, or kill, this cultural mini-phenom â€” not least because the feature is a more clever diversion than anyone had any right to expect.",
    "So gleefully vulgar, so eagerly offensive, it's tough not to get down on all fours and beg for more.",
    "Very funny, extremely obscene movie spinoff from the popular animated Comedy Central series.",
    "Far filthier and a good bit funnier than Trey Parker and Matt Stone's sophomoric cable TV show ever dared to be.",
    "Here's another warning: you may laugh yourself sick--as sick as this ruthlessly funny movie is.",
    "The ultimate truth, though, is that certain, probably arrested, personalities (like mine) just find this kind of shit pretty funny and any attempt to talk your way around that is, as Cartman would say, blowing bubbles out your ass.",
    "When it's on its game, and it frequently is, South Park's portrayal of its foul-mouthed, pre-teen, construction-paper-like protagonists' navigation of the absurd adult world around them cuts as deeply as any other current comedy.",
    "Every bit as tasteless, irreverent, silly and smart as the Comedy Central cartoon that catapulted creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone into the Hollywood catbird seat.",
    "Sharp, wildly funny social satire behind the profanity and potty jokes.",
    "Undoubtedly the rudest and possibly the most inspired comedy of the summer.",
    "An agreeable, albeit uneven, experience. Parker should take note, however, that, in some things, size doesn't matter and bigger doesn't mean better.",
    "Nonstop crudeness, vulgarity and unpleasantness. It's without any redeeming social value whatsoever. And it's funny from beginning to end.",
    "This has to be the raunchiest full-length animated feature since Fritz the Cat, which got an X rating in 1971.",
    "The kind of movie that can get you simultaneously laughing and shaking your head at its audacity.",
    "Bigger, Longer & Uncut delivers: It's never less than funny, and at its best, it's truly hysterical.",
    "Beneath the veneer of fake dicks and fart jokes, it's really a righteous paean to saying whatever the hell you want.",
    "In terms of raw wit and fearless satire, the South Park kids put Mike Myers and Adam Sandler to shame.",
    "Ok, I admit at first I was just laughing at the sheer gutsiness of South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. But after 10 minutes, I was laughing at the script.",
    "I laughed. I did not always feel proud of myself while I was laughing, however.",
    "Inspired, self-referential animated musical.",
    "Brilliant, in its own twisted way.",
    "Labors mightily to be as offensive and obnoxious as possible. It's inventive in an idiotic sort of way, though, and pauses occasionally to make serious points about movie violence and censorship.",
    "Gross-out funny, over-the-top offensive, and just as amusing -- or idiotic -- as you find that Comedy Central sitcom."

This film has everything that you could ever want from a comedy filmQuite simply the funniest cartoon of all time, Trey Parker and Matt Stone were able to successfully adapt South Park to the big screen in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. This film has everything that you could ever want from a comedy film and more; razor-sharp wit, laugh out loud dialogue, fantastic one-liners, self-parody and social satire. To top it all off, Parker and Stone created musical numbers worthy of the West End such as 'What Would Brian Boitano Do?' and 'Blame Canada', which helped lift South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut from being fantastic to one of the greatest films of all time. As well as being hilarious, South Park explores several serious themes and concept that are hard-hitting and thought provoking. Parker and Stone attempt and succeed magnificently in addressing concerns such as censorship and freedom of speech (at the centre of the films message), parenting, mortality, race relations, and much more. None of this detracts from the humour, however, as the audience enjoys a non-stop barrage of hilarity ranging from the use of sharp satire tools like Cartman's V-chip, to the wildly funny dialogue that flows effortlessly between characters, laden with profanity that will ensure that no matter what age, sexual orientation, gender, race, religion or nationality you are, you will be offend and you will most certainly be amused. A brilliantly crafted plot that flows easily from beginning to end and that fully includes the audience will ensure that there is not one weak point in the film were you lose interest or become lost, a tremendous feat for film-makers in the short-attention span modern world. The film is rooted in the core characters of Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman, who carry the film wonderfully with the help of an entourage of other superb South Park characters including Mr. Garrison, Saddam Hussein and Satan. South Park has defined a generation, and it did it especially quickly with the early release of the film, which was both a commercial and critical success, ensuring that South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut has gone the way of Monty Python films like th Life of Brian, in that they are immortalised and are revered as masterpieces of comedy and, indeed, film in general.It is the mistake of some critics and groups like the PTC to pass off South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as crude and vulgar, and they have entirely missed the point of the film. One of the greatest.",

The film starts with Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny going to see an R-rated \"Terrance and Phillip\" movie and the boys pick up the curse words they hear, if you get the implication. It leads to a series of events triggered by Kyle's strict mother which triggers an American-Canadian war, all as the result of her dissatisfaction with her child swearing. The musical numbers are perfect for this movie, as they are very catchy and bring lots of wit into the events, especially \"Blame Canada\" and \"La Resistance.\"\r I disagree with those who feel that this movie \"runs out of steam;\" the people who think this movie is just another comedy obviously don't understand South Park, and they certainly don't understand Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The imperfections in the animation and production value are intended as part of the humor, and you won't understand its sophistication unless you consider the story as a whole.

I did however know that it existed. After years of watching animated television shows, I decided to watch this series, and I loved it. Once I watched the first 15 seasons I decided to watch the movie. I can say that this is a good trend for television shows, the simpsons movie was a great success and so was this one. Like always the writers manage to create clever jokes and likeable characters. About the characters, I think an average viewer can watch this without watching the show; it would be advised to watch the first few seasons before hand, and that there won't be any confusion with watching this movie. One of the most obvious topics this film talks about is how parents don't deal with their kids watching inappropriate t.v shows, and how they prefer to blame others than themselves or their own children. This is a very good topic because it's aware of how some people aren't very fond of the show. A few shows I can think of do this as well, but this takes this to an extreme. Oddly enough this is a musical; I do not understand why they made this choice, but they do have some awesome songs such as: \"Kyle's mom is a  and blame Canada\". The possible reason for this choice is because they want to do a satire of Disney movies. The jokes in this movie work real well, they range from gross out to actual intellectual jokes. The characters are very well written, but of course it is carrying on from a television, but they're still a bunch of fun characters. This is a really fun movie to watch, and has some substance to make not seem like mindless entertainment.",

Almost all the humour comes from shock value, swearing and extremist thoughts. Very unrecommended for Canadian people and loversI suppose that in order to analyze this movie you definitely need to put some of your deepest convictions aside. Almost all the humour comes from shock value, swearing and extremist thoughts. Very unrecommended for Canadian people and lovers because the movie goes total trash to them.The pace is great. Scenario is as weird as those used in the TV series. So obviously if you love this series you will surely love the movie and vice-versa. Anyway the universe finally starts to show some lack of consistency. In the TV series you see those kids swearing all the times in front of their parents but in this movie swearing is going too far?! The movie is full of songs that are more or less funny and accurate. The major flaw to me for this is that the movie capitalize on its success of being openly disrespecful, political and by 'daring to say what nobody dares to say'. This project just appears to me as another step in the main direction taken by South Park without adding any effort to the approach. This sadly doesn't bring anything new to its universe.However I have to recognize that the creators are really inspired as they always manage to put the characters in the weirdest and most extreme situations. Everything always take disproportionate turns of phrase.",

Finally, this movie is just amazing with an incredible story followed up with some amazing voice actors and some very comedic scenes which always have me laughing. Overall, if you haven't watched it already it's worth the watch, you'll probably enjoy it as much as I did.",

The idea of the moms starting a war with Canada over kids swearing is brilliant and as a Canadian myself, I fâ€™ing love it! The raunchy and politically incorrect humour of this film is perfect and the jokes all land so well. This is also my favourite musical of all time with so many great funny songs and a million times better than any Disney movies. The way Saddam Hussein is portrayed in this film is priceless and is the funniest version of him in existence! Trey Parker and Matt Stone are such geniuses and did a terrific job at making South Park into a movie. You would have to be an extreme leftist with no sense of humour to not enjoy it.",
