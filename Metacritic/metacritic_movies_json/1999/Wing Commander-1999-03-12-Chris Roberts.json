  "rating": 5.1,
  "release_date": "1999-03-12",
  "summary": "A futuristic outer space dogfight adventure starring Freddie Prinze Jr.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "While much of the film is taken over by enormously entertaining dogfight sequences … much of it also rests on the narrative drive, which seems clipped part and parcel from one of those old “Why We Fight” documentaries that Frank Capra doled out to keep our G.I.s in fighting mode.",
    "The script too often sounds like an encrypted communique itself, and it's tiring trying to keep all the nonsensical space-jargon straight. The effort is more demanding than hanging onto a joystick, and not entirely worth the effort.",
    "Pretty much everything in this high-space war yarn has been swiped from other, better movies.",
    "Formulaic, humdrum and sometimes unintentionally laughable.",
    "Gets sucked into a gravitational cesspool of sci-fi clichés.",
    "These actors, alas, are at the service of a submoronic script and special effects that look like a video game writ large.",
    "Dopey.",
    "While it may be true that in space no one can hear you scream, groaning should be a perfectly audible way of saying the intergalactic alien-buster Wing Commander sucks.",
    "Fox should be paying potential viewers not to walk out of this turkey. The plot has all the depth and originality of a video game without the fun of the interactivity.",
    "While the plot is worthless and the battle scenes cheap-looking and unengrossing, Wing Commander has clearly defined characters and relationships. In other words, the film's young actors have nothing interesting to say, but they say it well.",
    "An excruciating no-brainer blend of “Starship Troopers” and “Top Gun,” without the former’s guilty-pleasure concoction of gory F/X and dark humor or Tom Cruise’s megawatt smile.",
    "Excruciatingly earnest yet convictionless movie.",
    "Cinematic sleeping pill.",
    "When all is said and done, then, the only thing this juvenile and shameless \"Star Wars\" knock-off does is whet your appetite for the real deal.",
    "Either a thoroughly incomprehensible movie or a daring exercise in the cinema of disorientation, and a painful viewing experience either way.",
    "Matthew Lillard of \"Scream,\" flies like his nickname and tries to bring the film some comic relief not already provided by the stultifying stupidity of the script.",
    "The film is painfully boring and funny in the wrong places.",
    "The effects are laughably primitive, the dialogue hilariously atrocious -- and those are the good parts."

The intense combination of an intergalactic war-story and a classic Shakespearian love-tale makes this movie an adrenaline-pumping tears-jerker Brilliantly scripted and marvelously acted Sci-Fi movie based on the all-time favorite PC-game. The intense combination of an intergalactic war-story and a classic Shakespearian love-tale makes this movie an adrenaline-pumping tears-jerker of historical proportion. Mankind can traverse the darkest depths of space, it will always bring along its emotions! The Kilrathi character-depth is the secret of its success, diminishing the personality of Hamlet to a superficial cartoon-character. While the lines spoken by the Kilrathi have the rhythm of a Swiss watch, it is the depth of their meanings that truly fascinates. Only repeated viewing can reveal the many layers of its message. Once discovered, your will agree that this is what takes Wing Commander beyond the level of the greatest classics of Hollywood or even global cinema. The people of the future will divide human history in the pre-Wing Commander era (or the Dark Age) and the post-Wing Commander era, when humanity finally became enlightened by this masterpiece and its powerful message. At a lower level, you are bound to forget the part of your life that was spent - wasted really - before you could become a wittness yourself to the brillance that is Wing Commander. Oscars may be awarded for artistry in film-making, only a Nobel Prize (or several) could do justice to the levels of excellence reached by Wing Commander. This production will no-doubt be remembered by the many generations to come as a turning point in movie-making. Its message, when correctly interpreted, will influence society as only the Holy Bible may have done before. Be ready to experience never-felt-before emotions as you watch this hallmark movie over and over again. It will leave its tracks on your soul ",

However, I have to lay low for a minute because I think it's a awfully but decently good bad movie. Wing Commander was everything full of awful in this so-called science fiction movie. The special effects are barely hard to watch, the pacing of the film just completely off the ground up, and although both Freddie Prinze Jr. And Matthew Lillard (both from Scooby-Doo) tried everything they can to make this movie more or less like a autopilot rerun of Battlestar Galactica. But still the acting is bad and the movie is completely forgotten, but as a fan of terrible b-movies of the 90's, maybe I'll give it a shot by renting this dumbload.",

      "content": "The enjoyment of this movie depends on 3 things. Firstly how much you like B movies, secondly how much (over)use of tropes, stereotypes and cliches you like or can endure and thirdly if you are a fan of the Wing Commander video games. For meThe enjoyment of this movie depends on 3 things. Firstly how much you like B movies, secondly how much (over)use of tropes, stereotypes and cliches you like or can endure and thirdly if you are a fan of the Wing Commander video games. For me it is a bit dividing. I like the B movie charm of this movie and find it enjoyable. I can mostly endure the tropes, stereotypes and cliches but freely admit that if you do a drinking game with a sip for them you will die of alcohol poisoning long before the movie ends;-). For the games: I know the games and have a small bit of experience with them. They were amazing at their time but the franchise is long dormant or even dead (The difference is actually hard to distinguish). For fans this is a nightmarish adaptation. It just uses some names, themes and visuals from the game to tell its own story. The fans even say that this has noting to do with the games and today there is the phrase “In name only adaptation” which was not used back then (or I just did not knew back then). Even if I am not a hardcore fan and my experiences with the franchise are limited compared to them I agree that they at least have a point. Because I have complained for other movies like Avatar the last Airbender which is a rape of the source material I cant give a free pass here as it would be hypocritical. Back to the movie: In the amazing intro which won me over the set up for the Human / Kilrathi conflict is explained. The Kilrathi are a warrior race and at conflict with humanity as they have no interested in diplomatic relations or coexistence (Already a few tropes). At the start of the movie the war is already ongoing for a while. The Kilrathi landed at critical coup as they managed to destroy an important outpost but archived to get an even more valuable price. They got a navigational computer which gives them the keys to the kingdom or to be more specific all routes and locations of the Terran Confederation. Earth itself is in danger as the Earth fleets are to far away to respond (Do you see what I mean? Even more tropes). A good set up for the story and should easily hook up B movie fans. However I hate the Star Trek inspired trope of incompetent defenses (= No ship or fleet is near the most important world / worlds).  This is insanity and only left the question how could they survive this long if they did not even manage the basics of warfare. In real life do you think an enemy could march from far away to Washington, Peking or Moscow and they could not stop them or put up a solid defense? Look for fictional examples at Mass Effect, Halo, Babylon 5 or Star Wars how they defend their important worlds. You could attack and even conquer them but only with a huge fleet and for a harsh price of countless causalities. In total I already explained it. The story is entertaining but uses a lot of tropes. Now for the actors lets start with a harming comparison. Do you know that the (later) games had an impressing cast of actors with the most prominent being Mark Hamill (Yes the Luke Skywalker one), John Rhys Davies, Malcom McDowell and Tom Willson (Back to the Future) atop of lesser know but good actors / actresses? Now try to tell me you wouldn't love to see these in the movie. We got instead Freddie Prince Jr., Saffron Burrows, Matthew Lillard, Jürgen Prochnow, Ginny Holder and Tcheky Karyo atop others. Don't get me wrong. These are all competent actors / actresses. It is more some underperformance and to a far lesser degree overacting in some scenes. As B movie fan this is not that much disturbing as I expected something like this. In total it is a weaker but not garbage performance which is still entertaining. I will praise however Tcheky Karyo as I still remembered his good performance. The special effects were good for its time and I see no missteps to complain. The Kilrathi however look strange and a bit unconvincing (Nothing like the games were they were catlike aliens). The star fighters were also nothing like in the games and I read that they used real fighter jets as models if I remember correctly. Overall this is not a good movie and cemented the videogame movie adaptations are always bad movie cliche. It has B movie charm and so bad it is good appeal for some including me (But not 100%). I enjoyed it somehow but still find the flaws outweighing the so good its bad appeal to give a higher rating. Cant recommend it for you expect you have even more of a soft spot for B movies like this.",

I thought they did their best on soundtrack and CGI from the beginning just in order to create a positive first impression, but no. Soundtrack and special effects remain particularly brilliant throughout the movie. All I can say is that 'Wing Commander' appears to be honestly ahead of its time, with those visuals I already spoke about, the fact that it showcases different powerful women, the sound effects and the noticable intensity oozing from space battles. It still has a smooth product placement at one time but I think that it doesn't ruin the film.'Wing Commander' surprisingly manages to be different from Star Wars and to craft its own moments of brightness and greatness despite some really pathetic scenes, almost harmless opponents (the defenseless Killrathi) and a lopsided acting. If the end (no spoil) and the overall plot are truly predictable and a bit tasteless from time to time it is still possible to find some fresh air bubbles here and there. But don't expect too much from it.",
