    "summary": "In this wild comedy of errors, a group of London friends find themselves deep in debt to an unsavory underworld figure.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "A dynamite bundle from British writer-director Guy Ritchie. Even when the accents are as indecipherable as the plot, Ritchie keeps the action percolating and the humor on high.",
        "The acting, mostly by a bunch of unknowns, is equally fresh and funny, and Ritchie keeps the movie moving faster than you can say, \"bludgeoned to death by a 15-inch black rubber dildo.\"",
        "With such a frenetic, brain-melting load of images to ponder, it's easy to forget that there are also some terrific actors at work here, not the least of whom is the amazing Vinnie Jones.",
        "It's a superior thriller made with the guts and gusto that too many recycled entries into the genre fail to exhibit.",
        "Lock is filled with great writing, great acting, colorful characters, and a tight story. I actually like this film more than \"Pulp Fiction\".",
        "Ritchie's showmanship--half macho braggadocio, half emotion-tinged bravura--slaps and tickles the viewer into submission. He takes a group of not-so-goodfellas, whose idea of fun is setting farts afire, and, against all odds, makes them lively and engaging.",
        "Ritchie appears to have been paying attention to what made \"Reservoir Dogs\" (a huge hit in the UK) work, rather than coming away convinced that the formula for success begins and ends with pop-culture allusions and scarcely digested \"homages\" to classic crime films.",
        "A special weapon unto itself. Spring-loaded with cockney esprit, it peppers its audience with aggressive, sarcastic grapeshot. That's English for \"fun,\" by the way.",
        "A considerable kick, though it would have helped if one of the boys had wiped off the lens of the camera once in a while.",
        "Much of the action is laugh-provoking, and even the plentiful violence is handled as comic by-play. The cast is revved up to sizzle, with Sting in a smallish role, and the thick cockney dialogue is more comprehensible than you might think.",
        "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is in the scabrous mode, and I like it better than \"Trainspotting\" -- it doesn't pretend its shenanigans are revolutionary.",
        "If the dialect is hard to comprehend, that soon becomes part of the joke. It's unlikely that even the British audiences who made Lock, Stock a big hit got it all.",
        "[It's] like Tarantino crossed with the Marx Brothers, if Groucho had been into chopping off fingers...Fun, in a slapdash way; it has an exuberance, and in a time when movies follow formulas like zombies, it's alive.",
        "Flawed but scrappy, confusing yet exhilarating, the Brit-made Lock, Stock is far from a perfect movie. And it's not for anyone squeamish about violence. But it is, like Green Day, a rockin' good time.",
        "The film's lures, while undeniable, are synthetic, and we never do learn what fuels all the greed besides pints of beer.",
        "The best one can say is that it's a smart cartoon, and a fairly exhausting viewing experience.",
        "Flashy, random shifts of film speed and a true rogues' gallery of striking if one-note characters, do hold interest even if they have no real right to. The commercial aspects also deflect attention from the fact that this story has almost no center at all.",
        "The humor is as crude as the characters, but the picture has energy.",
        "Given its boundless sarcasm, running-jumping- standing-still ambience and hyperbolic Guignol violence, Lock, Stock aspires to be something like the Beatles meet the \"Wild Bunch.\" Too bad it doesn't have even a rubber soul.",
        "Blends extremes of violence and humor to create an irreverent tone that nullifies everything; the plot is so clever it crushes the characterization, making all the action seem perfunctory.",
        "The laborious title of an even more laborious Cockney action movie that some people think is the cat's pajamas crossbred with the bee's knees.",
        "It's supposed to be visually exciting, but the result is more like a corpse-strewn Gap khakis ad than a triumph of technique. At least, based on the film's grainy texture and amber lighting, it's nice to know that the guy who shot every porn movie released in the '70s appears to be working again.",
        "The tediously convoluted plot involves the foursome\u2019s attempt to pay him back, a labored venture that involves crooks with names like Dog and Plank, a man on fire, some fine cinematography, plenty of gore though no real point."

Every line of dialogue they spat out sounded so forced, like they didn't believe in the characters they were playing. Some of the dialogue isn't very well written in the first place. There's one line that Dexter Fletcher said that goes \"Also, I think knives are a good idea... Knives are good, because they don't make any noise, and the less noise they make, the more likely we are to use them\", and I thought to myself, Is this guy trying to sell me knives? Vinnie Jones was the only one who really impressed me. I wanted to see more of the guy. He played his part perfectly, nailed every scene he was in, and I loved that his character brought his son around for everything like it was \"Bring Your Kid To Work Day\". I also felt the narration by Alan Ford, you gotta love his accent, but I felt some of the stuff he narrated made it sound like he was talking down to me instead of telling me things I couldn't have figured out otherwise. It was condescending and intrusive, chiming in at all the wrong times. The only good writing is evident at the very end of the movie, the \"cliffhanger\" ending, which I thought was brilliantly scripted and played out. Another issue I have with the film is the dirty look it has. I know this is accounted for its low budget, but the amber lighting and the heavy grain, it's not a pretty mix, and it's one of the ugliest-looking films I've ever seen.",

I'm not exactly sure why people saying \"Jesus Christ\" is supposed to be rip-roaringly funny. The delivery of most of the jokes (supposed or not) just isn't done very well. The characters themselves are the reason Ritchie's films are so good. Even if you don't like them, you *must* pay attention, and they're almost always totally watchable. Vinnie Jones has to be one of the coolest badasses of all time! Personally, I think Snatch, though very much a copy of this movie, is the better of the two. For pure entertainment, this movie is hard to beat. If you haven't seen this movie, by all means rent it, and then proceed to rent Snatch. They're both great movies!",

Also, if you don't like Monty Python or movies like Pulp Fiction, you won't like this movie. However, if you pass those litmus tests, you are in for a great ride. The story of how poor communication and crime leads to the downfall of virtually everyone, this clever action comedy has a great story, some great one liners, and characterization that deserves high accolades. Although at the end of the movie you get the point and it is a bit predictable, there is always another surprise waiting for you, and even guessing the plot outcomes is part of the fun.

One long Mexican stand off in the making with a sharp script full of memorable lines, 'it's been emotional', it's easy to imagine Lock Stock as a film Tarantino would be proud of.\r The opening scene belongs to Jason Statham, in his first film, playing a dodgy dealer in a role different to the action tough guys he would go on to trademark, as he wheels and deals fenced items with a  slang heavy script, 'it's a deal, it's a steal'. Ritchie does a good job of gradually introducing the film's characters as the layers of the story develop through narration and hearsay and the characters, from drug kingpin Rory Breaker to Rob Brydon's traffic warden, score the film major plus points.\r Lock Stock also boasts a brilliant soundtrack of contemporary British music, Ocean Colour Scene, The Stone Roses and some classic songs, Zorba the Greek, that are well used in the film.",

There is also some comedy in this. I did not find it that funny, but there were definitely some lines that had me laughing.\r Only complaint I can think of for this one is that at times the numerous layers of plot (particularly in the beginning) can be a little confusing and tough to adjust to.

Like, don't get me wrong, it is a good film from the get-go but I wasn't personally convinced by it to be more than that until the credits rolled - at which point, I found myself to have been thoroughly entertained.With Guy Ritchie in his directing debut and a whole host of familiar British faces, it isn't a difficult film to get into. I did feel at some points that there were too many characters and that they weren't distinctive enough; there were momentary bits where I had to think a tad harder at which characters were linked with each other. However, that actually turns into the film's best thing at the end as it does come together brilliantly.All in all, this 1998 gangster flick is something I'd consider as very good and worthy of watching.",
