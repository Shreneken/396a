  "title": "The Green Mile",
  "rating": 8.2,
  "release_date": "1999-12-10",
  "summary": "Set on Death Row in a Southern prison in 1935, this is the remarkable story of a prison guard who develops a poignant, unusual relationship with one inmate who possesses a magical gift that is both mysterious and miraculous.  (Castle Rock Entertainment)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Above all a cracking good yarn that earns its laughter, its wonder and its tears.",
    "As Darabont directs it, it tells a story with beginning, middle, end, vivid characters, humor, outrage and emotional release.  Dickensian.",
    "Darabont follows King's book fairly closely, allowing the audience to steep itself in the setting and characters slowly, like reading a good novel.",
    "A touching (and at times horrific) -- albeit overlong -- Christ allegory, that scores not so much on the strength of its convictions as it does on the truly remarkable performances it elicits from the cast.",
    "There's almost too much there, but the three-hour-plus film permits the kind of detailing that not only brings the storytelling to life, but sometimes persuades us we're breathing to its rhythms.",
    "Excessive, but I, like Mr. Jingles, can't resist the Christmas-season cheese.",
    "Has a simple but exceptionally powerful and uplifting emotional lure.",
    "A richly textured thriller.",
    "Well acted by an ensemble that leans toward equality for all, Mile carries its long running time extremely well.",
    "A film with a counterproductive tendency to take its time...but unassumingly strong, moving performances and Darabont's durable storytelling make it a trip worth taking just the same.",
    "From its deceptively easygoing beginning to the heart-wrenching finale, The Green Mile keeps you wonderfully high above the cynical ground.",
    "An intermittently powerful and meticulously crafted drama that falls short of its full potential due to considerable over-length and some shopworn, simplistic notions at its center.",
    "Modest, on-the-money performances, which look effortless because they're so meticulously thought out, make the hours fly by.",
    "A loud and ghastly movie to sit through and not short on gratuitous hideousness, but Darabont has also done his best to baste it with humanity and sweetness.",
    "A fascinating tragedy, easy to underrate.",
    "I still feel pushed around by Darabont's mysticism, and his overbearing sense of grandness; a little bit of the Mile goes a long way.",
    "Much of the three-hour movie takes place in the prison, but the resonant characterization, expansive plotting, and judicious use of exterior locations and flashbacks remove any sense of claustrophobia or sluggishness.",
    "Its view of spiritual healing is closer to Spielberg fantasy than religious insight.  Still, its good acting and good intentions will be enough to please many viewers.",
    "Simply a case of severe overreaching and the illusion that an overstuffed movie is an epic movie.",
    "A shameless \"Shawshank\" redux.",
    "Superficially respectful but ultimately cruel.",
    "Three hours of overstatement and schmaltz.",
    "While writer-director Frank Darabont often fails to make King's story plausible, that's no fault of the actors.  The performances are the movie's strong suit.",
    "Irritatingly repetitious and piled high with long-foreseen conclusions.",
    "Moves with the suffocating deliberateness of a river of molasses."

Characters that we connect with, and when anything happens to them in the movie we feel like crying our guts out.

Not even The Shawshank Redemption is as good as this movie (in my opinion). I have never seen a movie made with skill such as what can be found in The Green Mile. Most of this movie is just tuning in on these prison guards lives at their jobs and it is never at any point boring throughout the 3hour runtime. Stephen King wrote this book brilliantly and Frank Darabont brought it to the big screen brilliantly. Every single character in this movie is memorable and amazing. You will never hate someone as much as you will hate Percy, my personal favorite character form the movie. He was done so perfectly that it makes me feel bad for the actor because I might accidentally hit him if I ever see him in real life purely by instinct. *semi spoiler (but not really)* The other antagonist is also highly hateable. All the protagonist are very likable. The story is beautiful but might be difficult to swallow for people with certain religious beliefs. This is a must see, just don't watch it when you are sad and need a happy tale or comedy because this movie is full of tragedy.",

Tom Hanks is absolutely fabulous in the role of Paul Edgecomb, and the performances by Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse and Sam Rockwell add all the necessary depth to their characters. Thrilling, magical, funny, traumatising... The Green Mile is all those things and I believe it would be impossible to be bored by this film. It's another one that requires your undivided attention and it is quite long but it doesn't feel that way by the end.

Starring Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan, it tells the story of Paul Edgecomb, a guard working at a prison where a man named John Coffey is brought into custody. Though he has been convicted of brutally murdering two girls, Paul soon enough discovers that John has a special healing power and really comes across as a kind man. Though clearly demented at some points in the plot, THE GREEN MILE was overall a great film. I plan on reading the serial novel on which it is based sometime soon, as it is sitting on my bookshelf, collecting dust and waiting patiently to be read; but as for a recommendation for anyone who hasn't seen this, see it. I can't guarantee you'll like it--there's always a movie not to like, after all--and I can't exactly guarantee you'll make it through the entire three hours and eight minutes, but it is most certainly worth a try. Rent it on Netflix, find it broken up in segments on YouTube, find it on TV, get it On Demand, buy it--whatever. Just make sure you see this film.",

He is straightforward in shaking Paul's hand--not like a man with anything to be ashamed of.\r \"The Green Mile\" (so-called because this Death Row has a green floor) is based on a novel by Stephen King, and has been written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is Darabont's first film since the great \"The Shawshank Redemption\" in 1994. That, too, was based on a King prison story, but this one is very different. It involves the supernatural, for one thing--in a spiritual, not creepy, way.\r Both movies center on relationships between a white man and a black man. In \"Shawshank\" the black man was the witness to a white man's dogged determination, and here the black man's function is to absorb the pain of whites--to redeem and forgive them. By the end, when he is asked to forgive them for sending him to the electric chair, the story has so well prepared us that the key scenes play like drama, not metaphor, and that is not an easy thing to achieve.\r I have started to suspect that when we talk about \"good acting\" in the movies, we are really discussing two other things: good casting and the creation of characters we react to strongly. Much of a performance is created in the filmmaking itself, in photography and editing and the emotional cues of music. But an actor must have the technical and emotional mastery to embody a character and evoke him persuasively, and the film must give him a character worth portraying. Tom Hanks is our movie Everyman, and his Paul is able to win our sympathy with his level eyes and calm, decent voice. We get a real sense of his efficient staff, of the vile natures of Percy and Wharton, and of the goodness of Coffey--who is embodied by Duncan in a performance that is both acting and being.\r The movie is a shade over three hours long. I appreciated the extra time, which allows us to feel the passage of prison months and years. Stephen King, sometimes dismissed as merely a best-seller, has in his best novels some of the power of Dickens, who created worlds that enveloped us and populated them with colorful, peculiar, sharply seen characters. King in his strongest work is a storyteller likely to survive as Dickens has, despite the sniffs of the litcrit establishment.\r By taking the extra time, Darabont has made King's \"The Green Mile\" into a story which develops and unfolds, which has detail and space. The movie would have been much diminished at two hours--it would have been a series of episodes without context. As Darabont directs it, it tells a story with beginning, middle, end, vivid characters, humor, outrage and emotional release. Dickensian.",

A wonderful book, that is faithfully(mostly) adapted into an equally wonderful film. My only complaint of The Green Mile is the length, I do think it is too long. However, The Green Mile is a film that is haunting, thought-provoking, moving and engrossing.The film is beautifully directed by Frank Darabont(director of the slightly superior The Shawshank Redemption), is beautifully shot with a foreboding setting and atmospheric cinematography and lighting and has an engrossing and haunting story that is well-paced too. Thomas Newman's score is positively hypnotic and very beautiful, with some great authentic song choices, my favourite being Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams(And Dream Your Troubles Away).The script is thoughtful too, and the movie also has a big emotional impact without feeling manipulative, I honestly couldn't help crying at the end of the movie. I have to say as well, the execution scenes were really quite harrowing. The performances are strong, Tom Hanks is excellent as the warden, as is Doug Hutchison who gives a credibility and complexity to a character that could have easily been clichéd and David Morse as Brutus. But Michael Clarke Duncan is the actor I want to give the real kudos to, he has a wonderful character and he absolutely nails it.Overall, a very, very good movie. Had it been shorter, it would have been perfect. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

What made me even question this is I am watching the series in John Wayne Gacy the Killer Clown. And one of the victims child asked why did it take so long and there was supposedly some cops involved in the 33 crimes. So I started to think about The Green Mile and wondered...was this movie showing us that they did fake executions? You know movies reveal alot of things. Well you all ask what do I mean. Well the part when they were practicing the execution and they had the inmate acting like he was getting electrocuted. Well for one why wpuld they do that? With a inmate anyways. Why didnt they just do it with another officer? I believe they actually did stuff like that to fake executions on sime people. Because you know they put people out there to do things like this. I mean murder people and stuff. This is an evil world. How hard wpuld it be to fake an execution really? And they never let the public see it...why?

How Stephen King came up with such a poignant and heartfelt tale is beyond me, maybe it was divine intervention, but the story of the Green Mile is a unique and moving film, the likes of which I've never seen before. The story centers around a man who is sent to death row, and once there he is able to doing seemingly impossible things.

The combination of a strong sentimental story along with the acting power of Tom Hanks made this film one for the ages. The supporting cast, in particular Michael Clarke Duncan and Sam Rockwell, were tremendous assets to the film and their careers were launched with the help of Hanks's experience and King's amazing words, but this film is far from perfect. As an avid Stephen King fan, I know his attention to detail has often times been his downfall and to be honest, this film is about an hour longer than it needed to be. The story, in particular the ending were so powerful, that a lot of the in between could have been left on the cutting room floor. That aside, this is a long, but fantastic film with some of the best writing and performances you could find. Like many classic films the critics love, it's a bit long, parts of it are somewhat boring, and the storyline isn't for everybody, there are plenty of people who just won't get it.

Quite involving at its best and needlessly attenuated and self-consciously \"inspiring\" at its worst, pic has all the earmarks of a year-end prestige release, beginning with Tom Hanks at the top of a fine cast.\r Working from King’s 1996 bestseller that was published in six serialized paperback installments, Darabont is nothing if not a fastidious storyteller dedicated to fulsome character detailing and sturdy structural carpentry.\r In this new film, as in “Shawshank,” the writer-director proves very adept at lighting numerous long fuses that burn slowly through the yarn’s lengthy telling and finally pay off in some big moments, some more satisfying than others.\r It’s a tribute to Darabont’s skill that he is able to sustain interest in these strands over such a long haul; it’s a reflection of his self-indulgence that he should think that this material warrants such doting elaboration.\r Told as an epic flashback by a very elderly man who relates his long-secret story to a lady friend at a nursing home, tale is largely set within the modest confines of E block, or death row, at Cold Mountain Penitentiary in Louisiana in 1935.\r Title refers to the shade of the faded linoleum on the floor of the facility, a well-kept bright brick building that resembles a small warehouse.\r Presiding over the handful of inmates is head guard Paul Edgecomb (Hanks), a decent middle-aged man dedicated to maintaining as much calm and dignity as possible, given the dire circumstances of his prisoners.\r On his staff are his loyal second-in-command, Brutus “Brutal” Howell (David Morse); sensitive greenhorn Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper); old pro Harry Terwilliger (Jeffrey DeMunn); and the group’s wild card, Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), a shrimpy sadist who can get away with all manner of horrible behavior since he’s the son of the governor’s wife.\r Behind bars at the outset are good-hearted Creole Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) and repentant Native American murderer Arlen Bitterbuck (Graham Greene), who’s about to walk the mile to the electric chair.\r Shortly joining them, and barely able to fit into his cell, is John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a towering, heavily muscled black man who’s been convicted of killing two little girls. Belying Coffey’s menacing look, however, is his demeanor, which is unvaryingly sweet-natured, polite and openly vulnerable; the greatest concern of this illiterate, childlike giant is that some lights be left on at night since he’s afraid of the dark.\r Typical of Darabont’s deliberate approach is the detail with which he presents the rehearsal for the Indian’s execution. A morbidly tense and riveting sequence reveals a startlingly makeshift-looking electric chair and what it takes to successfully put a prisoner to death.\r So, between the opposite poles of good and evil repped by the saintly simpleton Coffey on the one hand and the maniacal Wharton and Percy on the other, Darabont begins heavily developing thoughts about the extremes of which human beings are capable, as represented by their ability to give life and take it away.\r While “The Green Mile” often grabs, and generally holds, one’s attention through the long journey, there are any number of sequences that could have been tightened or eliminated in the interests of storytelling dispatch. Darabont’s technique readily sustains the thoroughness with which he develops scenes, but his points would still be clear enough without the epic treatment.\r And while Hutchison and Rockwell create deliciously hateable figures of pure evil, and Duncan elicits appropriately massive sympathy with his pivotal performance as the agent of goodness, these characters never grow multi-dimensionally and are ultimately more symbolic than credibly real.\r All the same, the ensemble acting is of a high order. Hanks excels as the prison guard who is well balanced enough to nearly always handle his many troubles in proper, imaginative fashion.\r Along with Duncan, all the other actors playing doomed inmates get their big moments to shine, with Jeter blending courage with emotional fragility as Delacroix.\r Percy aside, the prison officials are all portrayed as fundamentally upstanding. Gary Sinise is commanding in his one scene as an attorney who gives his views on Coffey to Edgecomb.\r Within individual scenes, Richard Francis-Bruce’s editing is impeccably precise in obtaining maximum values, while Thomas Newman’s generally strong score occasionally slips over-stressed grandeur.",

It was in prison that he met John Coffey, a black giant accused of murder, but that seems able to do incredible things and have a kindness beyond doubt. Directed and written by Frank Darabont, based on a Stephen King novel, it features Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan in the lead roles.This film is proof that, even in Hollywood, film art still finds a room. In fact, it's one of the most beautiful and human films made by the industry in recent decades and deals with controversial issues such as the impartiality of the justice and prison system, questionableness of capital punishment and the human right to a truly fair trial. The script is above reproach and it truly lives up to King's book. The cast surpassed in quality, particularly Michael Clarke Duncan, an actor who still isn't very famous outside the U.S. but that made a deep and moving role. Tom Hanks was also good but it wasn't unexpected because he had shone in recent films like \"Philadelphia\" or \"Saving Private Ryan\", launched one or two years before this.Address controversial issues in an original and impactive way is often synonymous with success in cinema. Personally, I consider this film as one of the finest ever made in U.S. over the past decades. The film speaks for itself and that's enough to understand why I think so.",

It may be a tad over three hours, but it feels significantly shorter. Plus, the added time allows us to spend more time with the characters, which is something I will never argue as a negative for this one. Tom Hanks, David Morse, Michael Clarke Duncan, Doug Hutchison, Barry Pepper, Sam Rockwell, Michael Jeter, and James Cromwell, make up one hell of an ensemble cast for this one and all truly knock their roles out of the park. I am typically not a huge fan of prison dramas, but the heart and compassion you feel for everyone involved in amazing and truly draws you in. The more fantastical elements are also very interesting and set against the backdrop of a very realistic situation are all the more odd, but I think they are handled very well. As a whole, this one is very intriguing, touching, and unique, which elevate it above many prison dramas. Add in the great acting and you truly have something special with The Green Mile.",

Period.\rBasically, it starts and ends without questioning death penalty. Death penalty is barbaric for MY culture, and the behavior of the characters never seems realistic to me. The horrible system behind death row is depicted in a mitigate, sweetened way. There's no room for compassion in death penalty as shown in the film, and this film is basically offensive solely for the way the characters are behaving.\rSecond: nothing is believable. Clearly is a fantasy drama, but still as the stereotyped characters (bad people are bad without a reason, they are simply mad. Good people are in fact not really good, but seam dumb and ataraxic, resulting in unlovable characters). The main character is basically a scary black giant who cries all the time. Very easy way to provoke reactions in the viewer is to show him something which he's unconsciously scared off while enforcing this unconscious fear with clever direction. Incidentally this unconscious fear is based on a black stupid strong man stereotype overlapped by the boogeyman figure. I'm a caucasian european man and i find this VERY offensive.\rThe whole story, in the end, is based on emotional tricks. (the *spoiler* bad death scene is traumatic and unnecessary, at least as it is shown). Giving strong emotions to people based on meaningless story or characters is a cheat.\rThis film is bad. I couldn't expect this since the reviews are so high. But i found this film ruffian, manipulative and ultimately ugly.",

Honestly I don't know what genre to categorise it as because it looks like a prison drama but crime, fantasy, drama could be possiblities... We know the black dude behind bars supposedly accused of murder holds some supernatural healing powers or some rubbish and has flies or something coming from his mouth which is bizarre but the healing process you could class as supernatural... The Green Mile stars Tom Hanks, David Morse, Michael Clarke Duncan and Sam Rockwell who I must admit is annoying in this film and so is Doug Hutchison or whatever his name is from The X Files.. This film is about 3 hours long or more and it's totally unnecessary especially since not much happens because all we see is a prisoner being annoying and being put in a padded room and some mouse being clever performing tricks and some big black guy with flies oozing from his mouth and healing the odd person plus one of the prison workers ending up in a mental hospital and one of the prisoners getting shot and a few executions.. To be honest it gets rather boring and the only character I really liked was Tom Hanks's character and Michael Clarke Duncan's character kept crying all the time which was laughably pathetic but I liked Tom Hanks. Besides that The Green Mile delivered nothing and the entertainment value was little and some of the characters were crap and annoying plus alot of the locations looked tacky and you only ever see one part of the prison all through the film which is laughable and dull and why so many rate this garbage as a classic is beyond me. Quite possibly one of the worst films I've seen in a while so if you want a decent prison film or a decent film full stop avoid this turd and watch something else.",

We cross themes of spirituality, humanity, good versus evil and also some fantasy which all work brilliantly together to bring a deeply moving film with excellent performances from the entire cast. Some have complained that the movie is far too long but for me the time flew because every scene is worthwhile, the film draws you in from the outset and doesn't let go with little sub themes and a rich multi-layered story that is rich and beautiful but also terribly sad at times. If you don't like this film then in my view you don't know what being human is all about. An astonishing beautiful film that will stay with you for a long time.",
