  "summary": "Matthew Broderick plays a bumbling detective in this film based on the animated television series.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "While it is a spectacle of animatronics, digital graphics and other special effects, the actors are never overwhelmed by them as personalities.",
    "Shot mostly in close-up, with nearly every action accompanied by a sound effect, the film itself is slightly hysterical.",
    "There's something for everyone in this 70-minute special effects frolic, and lovers of the cartoon will find the movie relatively faithful to its animated predecessor.",
    "The movie, based on the TV cartoon series, is exceptionally pleasant, and there's just enough humor to make it enjoyable for adults.",
    "A judicious mix of the lightly gory, the generously cartoonish, and the unexpectedly atmospheric makes for action that's scary yet unintimidating.",
    "A short, meaningless blast of fun from Disney.",
    "Inspector Gadget may be a live-action movie, but at its heart it's more cartoonish than most cartoons.",
    "It lacks, despite the remarkable techno effects by wizard Stan Winston, originality and charisma.",
    "Feels like a demonstration reel for toys, action figures and future DisneyQuest installations.",
    "The image of this kitchen-magician dream robot comes at us in little jolts and spasms that have the zappy, self-contained rhythm of a fast-food tie-in commercial.",
    "What a joyless, fussy contraption of a movie!",
    "The plot was an arbitrary concoction.",
    "Gadget instead ends up as another mindless, noisy thrill ride that gorges its audience on bright effects and leaves it queasy from overconsumption.",
    "In the end the elaborate gimmickry of Inspector Gadget cannot conceal its very ordinary storytelling.",
    "Like the cartoon on which it's based, Inspector Gadget has moments of absurd fun and droll wit, but they are fleeting and few.",
    "Disney has struck once again, taking a passably entertaining cartoon and turning it into a motion picture so lifeless that it's almost unwatchable.",
    "A downright dumb movie that, with its breathless pace, lack of character development and uninventive gags, might be torture for even the kids to sit through.",
    "Anyone older than eight is likely to find it a ridiculously extravagant exercise in stupidity.",
    "Are there really legions of postboomers out there sighing nostalgically over the happy hours they spent watching Inspector Gadget?",
    "Within a few minutes of the film's frenetic opening set piece, however, it's obvious that director David Kellogg and screenwriters Kerry Ehrin and Zak Penn have no idea how to capture the spirit of the source material.",
    "Mathew Broderick is likeable enough as the gizmo and gadget-toting cartoon hero in-the-flesh, but the plot, to which the FX wizardry is strung to, is in serious need of a tune up.",
    "A new standard for wretched excess is established by Inspector Gadget, a joyless and charmless disaster in which state-of-the-art special effects are squandered on pain-in-the-backside folly."

What did Disney done wrong was trying to make an iconic 80's cartoon into a blatant ripoff of Get Smart. Although I love the Youngstown Disney version of \"I'll Be Your Everything,\" the rest of the movie is ugh... absolute torture. Not even Matthew Broderick of all people tried and failed miserably as the detective with a whole lot of bumbling \"Go Go Gadget\" jokes and adding sexual references and violence that were so offensive, it is not suitable for anyone who is growned up in the 90's neither the Disney kiddies. I think this and Broderick had it wrong with a casting choice that includes D.L. Hughley and Michelle Trachtenberg (wasn't she supposed to be on Nickelodeon?).  Also, the script is pointless, bad acting, focuses on too much comic humor. Even worse, in the cartoon, the Gadgetmobile doesn't actually talk. In the movie, playing a talking Gadgetmobile is wrong or maybe because it's worser than Godzilla's roar in the 98 version. Do us all a favor Disney and stop giving these cartoon remakes a chance.",

The score is phenomenal - easily the best part of the film. The original cut of the movie contained a grittier operation scene, more use of Shuki Levy's original IG theme song, additional rampage scenes of Robo Gadget destroying Riverton, and a missing scene of Gadget testing out his new Gadgets. Certainty not an award winning film but I think the original cut would have been received far better by fans of the cartoon series.",
