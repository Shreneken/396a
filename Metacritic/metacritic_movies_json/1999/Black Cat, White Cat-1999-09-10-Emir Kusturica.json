    "critic_reviews": [
        "Astonishing, crazily delightful.",
        "A warm embrace of tradition and boisterous, ethnographically rich local culture.",
        "There's something almost wearying as well as exhilarating about the perpetual brilliance of Bosnian-born filmmaker Emir Kusturica.",
        "Made with such overriding jubilation that its coarseness is mostly liberating...well worth admiring for its sheer glee.",
        "Kusturica works marvels with his endlessly amusing cast, and his film has an appealingly free and easy tone.",
        "Kusturica's always masterful orchestration of chaos, coincidence and caricature really pays off as a sweet, soulful celebration of old friends, new loves and the mad scramble of life at the fringe.",
        "The gusto in the flying bullets, the fleeing lovers, and the flowing music will make you want to hang around until the party is over.",
        "This is not comfortable comedy.",
        "A wild, endlessly inventive romp set in a post-war world so full of machine-guns and hand-grenades that people barely flinch when one or the other goes off.",
        "It's thrilling to see something this profane, mythic and, most of all, not bored with life, love and the possibilities of cinema.",
        "An absurdist Eastern European version of \"The Godfather,\" starring the Marx Brothers (and sisters and nephews and...).",
        "Farcical mayhem. A convoluted plot that's easy to follow but hard to describe.",
        "The slapstick is broad to the point of overkill.",
        "There is a point in the movie when this mayhem crosses the line from wildly imaginative to downright insufferable.",
        "Their shenanigans rarely run short of explosive energy.",
        "Determined to twist every character into an ideogram for vulgar humanity."

It took me for nearly 30 minutes to understand the characters and storyline. After that it was non stop adventurous fun ride especially wedding ceremony scenes were extremely amusing. Each character was funny and very unique which made the movie very special. I liked the total scenario, I mean the culture and all as in a movie which generated laughs in us.\r It was a beautiful romance tale with a backdrop of gangster theme. Actually there were two gangsters in the story, where a father and a son and his love lady are stuck and struggle in between them. When a new business fails, the father is in the position with one option left to solve where his son must take the hand of the sister of money lender. In other hand the son is in love with another girl. The money lender's sister is also forced to do so yet to find her perfect man. When all these characters meet at once in the wedding ceremony, the twist and turn in the story occur and who are all getting benefit of it is the remaining.\r It is unbelievable that I almost gave a high rating to this movie. You know I was not in favour of it when I began to watch after the so average opening sequences. While progressing the story it emerged as a finest comedy, in fact one of the finest comedy ever produced. For every scene after a scene it began to surprise me in every possible way. It was only moving harder and deeper reaching the core of the audience's laughing sense to tickle. I might be overwhelmed, it may not bring LOL at you because it was a dark humorous flick so definitely it will bring a large smile on your face throughout.\r There was a fat pig often showed in the movie which was eating some old car's skin. I don't know what it's for and where it fits in the story but it was very much enjoyable for the moment. Like that there were many huge humorous scenes it had. Musics and dances were another advantage of the movie. For the last 90 minutes I almost forgot myself. I have been among those characters and enjoyed every second of my stay. I can highly recommend it to you but I don't know whether it is your kind stuff. Certainly I assure majority of you would love the movie and you may consider one of your all time favourite comedy ever.",

The storyline is very difficult to describe, so you can just watch the film as the plot is easy to follow. The Grga family are hilarious, and there is one scene where a pig licks the paint of a car off, for no particular reason! This film is a one of a kind masterpiece, as long as you're okay with a Bulgarian film with English subtitles and tons of bad language. If you're okay with that, then go watch Black Cat White Cat!!",
