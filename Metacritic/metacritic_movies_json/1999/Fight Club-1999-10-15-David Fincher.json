  "summary": "The film's narrator (Norton) attends support groups of all kinds as a way to \"experience\" something within his unfeeling, commercial existence.  On a business trip, he meets Tyler Durden (Pitt) who encourages them to form a fight club as a release for their latent aggressive tendencies.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Delivers a sucker punch to the audience and then pulls the rug out from under it. It is sensational. It is also grimly funny.",
    "It always surprises, never bores. It's also just damn good, on every possible level -- so go see it. Now.",
    "A knockout...So feverish is Fight Club...that thermometer contact might make mercury shatter.",
    "It assaults us with violence, brutality, sexual confusion and anarchy and has enough bruising, punishing humor to keep us laughing with relief.",
    "Bold, inventive, sustained adrenaline rush of a movie.",
    "Fight Club's dirty little secret is it's one of the best comedies of the decade.",
    "It's the rawest, most hot-blooded, provocatively audacious, dangerous movie to come of out Hollywood this year.",
    "The sardonic, testosterone-fueled science fiction of Fight Club touches a raw nerve.",
    "Never less than dazzling to look at, and the scorching humor keeps it alive from scene to scene.",
    "A brilliantly realized series of sucker punches, a philosophical howl disguised as a muscular guy movie.",
    "As a piece of storytelling, Fight Club is a bit of a dud: It's a good 15 minutes too long, and the tension doesn't build the way you wish it would.",
    "Begins with that invigoratingly nervy and imaginative buzz. But its chic indictment of empty materialist values fizzles.",
    "It's visually surrealistic, acted with integrity, so brutal in spots that I averted my eyes.",
    "A provocative experience that lights you up even as it brutalizes you. And I don't even like Brad Pitt very much.",
    "It's fun to talk about...but the price you pay is enduring its excesses and pummeled-home thematic points.",
    "On a purely visual level, it's the most powerful and viscerally exciting movie to come out of Hollywood this year. Which doesn't mean that it's all good.",
    "This exercise in mainstream masochism, macho posturing, and designer-grunge fascism is borderline ridiculous. But it also happens to be David Fincher's richest movie.",
    "But the second act is pandering and the third is trickery, and whatever Fincher thinks the message is, that's not what most audience members will get.",
    "But imagination and energy are often not enough. On balance, this is the dumbest of the entries in Hollywood's anti-consumerist new wave.",
    "Undermines its serious undertones with an avalanche of smirky cynicism designed to flatter the hipper-than-thou fantasies of adolescent moviegoers.",
    "This malevolently gleeful satire...is extremely funny, surprisingly well- acted, and boldly designed...at least until its steel-and-chrome soufflé falls apart.",
    "Grueling and bleak, but not unintelligent...although it's hardly groundbreaking just because everyone's face gets pulpy.",
    "Fight Club is to intelligent men what Catherine Breillat's \"Romance\" is to intelligent women -- an insult.",
    "This much-anticipated but terribly underwhelming black comedy represents a seriously squandered opportunity.",
    "What's most troubling about this witless mishmash of whiny, infantile philosophizing and bone-crunching violence is the increasing realization that it actually thinks it's saying something of significance.",
    "If, as Fincher has said, this movie is supposed to be funny, then the joke's on us."

In the most cathartic, DIY approach possible, Fight Club answers this question: you change it. TheNearly everyone knows the rules, number one of which I’m about to break.\r What do you do if you’re sick of your boring, pathetic life? In the most cathartic, DIY approach possible, Fight Club answers this question: you change it. The absolute prototype of an existential thriller, it wouldn’t be taking too much of a leap to suggest that Fight Club is one of the best films ever made.\r Jim Uhls’ excellently adapted screenplay of Chuck Palahniuk’s novel (this is the only major work by Uhls that I can find), this thriller has been exciting male audiences the world over since its release in 1999. Even Palahniuk himself said the film was amazing. In fact, he admitted that film was so good, the book in comparison made him feel ashamed.\r A nameless, pitiful, seemingly friend and family-less Office worker (Edward Norton) suffers from insomnia. True to Palahniuk’s style, the solution to the insomnia comes in a bizarre way. He finds relief by attending support groups for diseases, diseases he doesn’t have; these people really listen to him, and afterwards, he sleeps. At these meetings he meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Character), a nemesis and lover, and it is through her that Mr. Office worker discovers his true self, but not until after he’s transformed more than just his own life.\r Mr. Pitiful Office worker meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Durden helps Mr. Pitiful Office worker admit to his misery once and for all. Channeling their suppressed male aggression in its rawest form, they start fighting each other. Soon Mr. Pitiful Office worker realizes that he and Durden are not alone.\r Men, downtrodden, tired of their insignificance as worthless individuals all aim to do something greater. They jump at the chance to vent their primal steam, and the solo fights turn into group fights.\r Durden’s vision eventually transcends aggression in its physical form and becomes something much greater, a community where the individual ceases to exist. As part of this whole, every unnamed member is an equal and significant contributor, and it is through the whole that the individual finds meaning. As part of the whole they are changing the future together.\r This movie is a directing marvel. With time shifts, psychological manipulations, and very meticulous scene planning, we are kept on the edge of our seats for the entire film. Accompanied by the pounding soundtrack composed by the Dust Brothers, Fincher achieves the rarity of making a movie better than a book. Fincher turns the concrete basement of Lou’s Tavern into perhaps the most famous arena in all of modern film. The house on Paper Street, a lone abandoned mansion, becomes a factory of redefinition, of reinvention. In the final scene an amazing mesh between the visuals and the music, The Pixies’ “Where is my Mind,” Fincher creates one of the most stunning combinations of sight and sound in all of film. And it's a pretty damn good ending to the plot too.\r The most memorable scene is when Durden is behind the wheel of a car full of passengers. He buckles up, pins the gas, and lets go of the wheel. The car veers off the road and crashes, flipping multiple times. We are force fed the hard truth here. The Fight Club mantra: to change to our lives we need to rid ourselves of our past failures, forget the job, the kids, the car, the living room, the flat screen HDTV, and just let go.\r You are not your f'cking khakis.",

Before this movie, I couldn´t guess that a girl can act so good, obviously talking about Helena Bonham Carter.\r In some words, the movie is, in my opinion, unique, epic, special, mind-blowing, astonishing, and necessary to see before rest in peace.",

The tone of the book has been grasped by writing staff exquisitely though there is little focus on one of the roots of the main character's overall issue: the abscence of a certain family member (the book covered that part more sufficiently). All in all, this movie gave me a new look at my life and my place in it being a rather complex visualization of the book written by Chuck Palahniuk. The soundtrack is worth to be praised on its own: I have listened to it many times while doing homework (not the one depicted in the film) and thinking about life. That's all I have to say for my other feelings for that movie (and the book combined) can't be transferred into words. Watch it.",

Everything is just SO GOOD! The direction is of the world, being able to not let attent viewers confused, not revealing anything until the end of the movie but letting some hints before the reveal at the end so we can feel like we have been fooled even when the clues were right on our faces all along. The acting is amazing! Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter excel at showing off their unique characters, which are all oozing with personality. The soundtrack is amazing, the tone is consistent during the whole movie, and the pacing is really good. But now let's talk about the movie's best attribute, the story. HOLY. F*@KING. SH%T. It was one of the smartest things I ever saw in a movie, and if you stop to analyze it is pretty simple, a guy with two personalities has its life changed when one of the personalities start to influence him and it creates a whole army to accomplish a revolutionary goal, the key that made the story work is the way that we are told about the things, we see everything through the eyes of the unnamed narrator (which I will refer as Jack), so we never understand some things because, like him, we are unaware that Tyler Durden is, in fact, another personality he created without knowing it, which is another masterful idea, the fact that Jack is unaware that Tyler Durden is not a real person, which makes sense considering that he would more likely be influenced by someone who is not just another version of himself but a brand new human being. Like I said previously, how we are told the stuff that happens is what makes the story so great if we know from the beginning about Tyler's plan, he would be way less shocked when he discovered about it, the same can be said about Tyler reveal as not being real, if the hints were not so subtle we would have all figured it all before Jack and this would have ruined the shock completely, there is also the idea of 'toxic masculinity' around this movie, and the more I thought about it, the more it made sense, of course, Jack idea of a 'manly man' would be someone as confident, violent and careless as Tyler, it just works so well I am honestly shocked. Overall, this movie is fantastic, I would rewatch it all the time if I could. 10/10 Masterpiece.",

I will try however to try and simplify as much as I can. Fight club is about an insomniac who meets this guy who then gets him to form a fight club. From that it sounds pretty simple, but in actuality it's a bit more complex. He starts joining therapy sessions merely for the thrill, I know it's strange right? But apparently the thrill is that he can finally try and show some emotions. I guess that this is here to later show up in the film, like how they talk about his life is meaningless and he only goes along with curve to get by. A lot like the catcher in the Rye. Once we are introduced to Tyler Durden the film starts to become much more interesting, and I think that's a good joke as well. Brad Pitt does a great job of being this leader of anarchy, he's charismatic, and has the right attitude to approaching people to join his cause. Edward Norton however is uninteresting, but that's the point, and I guess that's a pass in my book. One of the most famous parts of this movie figuring out who Tyler Durden really is, and when you find know it makes everything you just scene even more weird. Also the themes it tries to convey are bit too complicated or not that well thought out. I really do like this film, and I think it is a very good movie, but I think again that it may be saying a bit too much or not making sense.",

Personally, I had low expectations when I saw this movie, but in fact I had read virtually nothing about it before I saw it.The ingenious script is based on the strange and somewhat masochistic friendship between two very different men. One is very shy and the other very rebellious and iconoclastic. Both create a discreet, strict-rule fight club that evolves into a sort of secret society of anarchist contours. The story has a lot of twists and turns, surprising us, catching our attention. However, its not a perfect movie and there are really logical gaps and credibility issues in the story, not to mention that, at some point, the audience no longer really knows what is true in everything they saw. I believe this is intentional, and I recognize that its a feature that has its charm, but it may disappoint some people (personally I dealt with it reasonably well).A decidedly good point in this movie is the gigantic performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Both are great actors, when they have space and material to evolve, and that's what happened here. Both actors were brilliant and developed throughout the film a bizarrely perfect partnership, with a touch of sadism, repressed homosexuality and predatory instinct. David Fincher, the director, also deserves congratulations, as he's the hand that guides everything and manages, with this film, to present to the world what (so far) is the masterpiece of his career as a film director.Technically, the movie is quite good. The shadowy cinematography and the use of high contrast between light and dark were well used features, and the shooting and framing angles are very clever. The soundtrack, discreetly, also helped to accentuate the film's surrealism at the right times. Of course, its an action movie about an underground fighting club, so there are plenty of scenes of gratuitous violence, some of them quite brutal, as well as nudity and dialogues loaded with insults and profanity. So, I leave my warning to parents: its not a children's movie at all, and even teenagers should only watch it with great caution as its really a violent movie.",

Es handelt von einem namenlosen Protagonisten (Edward Norton), der sich mithilfe des Seifenverkäufers Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) aus dem alltäglichen Korsett aus Konsum, Büroarbeit, und Schlaflosigkeit befreien will. Der Film ist nicht nur durchgängig spannend, sondern schafft es Sozialkritik, männliche Identitätsfindung, psychische Krankheiten und viele andere Themen zu berühren, ohne dabei jemals langweilig zu werden oder hochtrabend zu wirken. Auch visuell ist der Film stimmig und beeindruckt mit seinen Kamerafahrten, glaubwürdigen Kampfeinlagen, und einem stimmigen Gesamtbild. Fight Club vermittelt nicht nur rohe Brutalität, sondern hinterlässt einen Sinn von Melancholie beim Zuschauer, wozu sowohl der stimmige Soundtrack, die meisterhafte Inszenierung als auch die hochkarätige Besetzung beitragen. Das actionreiche Drama schafft es die Balance zwischen Unterhaltsamkeit und Tiefsinn zu halten, und ist wegen seiner hohen Qualität in allen Aspekten einer meiner absoluten Favoriten.",

In this film there isn't a first and second half, it is a full length movie plain and simple (and believe me, I do understand that they just say that to divide parts of the movie for easier reference). The movie is supposed to be thought like this to show the adaptation of the plot. Please people, seriously! Even the actual critics have ruined what should be an almost, if not completely, perfect score. The scores that some of these critics give leave their comments to \"sick, twisted humor\" or something of the sort - WHAT?! Go critique somewhere else please, because, although the movie is supposed to be humorous (which can be understood by the more deeper thinkers) it is not only a comedy with a crazy plot twist. This movie of course will be liked by some more than others, but if you don't understand the actual plot line and what it really is, then just leave your comments to yourself or share them with a friend, and if you really want to see what the movie conveys, then read some of these reviews or watch the movie again or something! The movie uses so many great techniques, not only in dialogue but also in camera usage and almost eveyr single possible ability that could be used in a movie, really. Oh yeah and back to the quote that I used to start this off (a quote from one of the other users), the movie is not just about \"The theme is about how modern society has reduced males into enneuchs and how this warps our subconscious into anarcho-fascist mode\" (did you not notice the entire appearance of the character Marla Singer?) although it may sound sort of corny, the theme could be considered more along the lines of \"There is a Tyler Durden in all of us\" kind of thing. There is way too much detail to go into for such a well thought out and socially complex movie for me to put in here. Watch the movie again, and if you don't get it - watch it again. An element of the movie that is so genius is that although it is deep and all, the actual approach to the movie and the plot and the entire film, really, is that it doesn't have an \"artsy-fartsy\" kind of setting and dialogue (to some extent yes it does, but you get the point.. I hope) it uses a more down-to-earth realistic view of ourselves, and I say ourselves as everyone, and the actual fabric of human nature and how some things affect the subconscious. Fight Club is really a very, very good movie.",

I've never written a review for any film before, but even 9 years after its release, Fight Club has earned it. Violent, yes, of course. It's called Fight Club. But strangely enough, that's a misleading title. It's the most ambiguous fable ever, in that the moral is whatever you make it out to be. This movie solidified Edward Norton to me as a top-tier actor capable of sheer brilliance, and Brad Pitt is amazing as well, cool and scary and ridiculously funny with his red leather jacket. Which brings me to my next point, if you've heard the word \"comedy\" used in relation to Fight Club, you heard correctly. It points out the hilarious nature of society's individuals to try desperately to reach some form of perfection, but of course we know this is impossible. Almost every motif you could think of in a great satirical tale is present in Fight Club. The one I never hear people mention is addiction. (Society",

My review of David Fincher's classic adaption of Chuck Palahniuk's transgressional fiction master work. \"Fight Club\" tells the story of a corporate drone (Norton) who (like many) is displeased with his life. He, in turn, forms a 'fight club' with Tyler Durden (Pitt) a soap maker to escape from this sedative lifestyle. Now right off the bat, if this movie were shown to the original pioneers of film (i.e. Porter, Chaplin, Capra) I can safely say that upon completion of the film they would promptly scream, yell, cry, and then explode. . . .maybe. They would definitely be appalled by what they would see. However, this does not make \"Fight Club\" a bad film. For, film, like literature, can take on many forms and eventually evolve over time. Though the themes displayed throughout the film are definitely strange and at times shocking, they are also peculiarly thought-provoking and at times pragmatic. The movie's messages on defiance and nihilism are deeply rooted within it's very intelligently written script. The dialogue is hilarious and at times disturbingly provocative. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are two intensely talented actors, and seeing them work together on screen is really entertaining. Though anyone who watches this movie will walk out of the film talking about Brad Pitt's unforgettable portrayal of Tyler Durden. Pitt's obvious dedication to the role, paired with the near-perfectly written script he was given, makes for a character that I will quote many a time to come. Another aspect that I found particularly unique was the cinematography. I found that Photographic Director Jeff Cronenweth did a noteworthy job with the visuals of this movie. He really succeeded in using lighting to accentuate just how dismally somnolent the narrator's life is. I also felt that the use of lighting towards the end of the film was also very aesthetic. As for direction, David Fincher is . . . .well he's David Fincher. The guy really knows how to put a film together. In the end, \"Fight Club\" is a dark, dreary, appalling, hilarious film that I am glad to call a classic piece of American culture.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nLots of movies try to be daring. Lots of movies try to be hyper stylized, interestingly crafted, confusingly brilliant, and narratively abstract.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing, actually I love different, but what I'm trying to say is that everyone tries to be \"the first\" and no one does a better job at creating something like that than Fight Club.\rFight Club is the definitive perfect movie. Not one movie does what this movie has accomplished and I don't think any other movie will ever do something like this again. It's the exact definition of abstract and I think that is a beautiful thing. There's a lot I have to say about this movie because this one is very near and dear to my heart and I know it is with a lot of other people too, but I also know that a good amount of people also hate this movie, but that's just part of the beauty. It has the unique ability to both be worshiped, and be despised all at the same time. I'm a worshiper.\rIf you haven't seen Fight Club you will probably guess that it's all about two guys who create a club that lets people release their aggression by beating each other to a pulp. Well, that is a part of it, but a surprisingly very small one. That's just the background, not only is Fight Club one of the most narratively abstract movies I have ever seen, it is also the movie with the most underlying themes. Fight Club is about much, much more than just fighting.\rYou may have heard the line, \"this is your life and it’s ending one minute at a time.\" Well, I live by that line, literally. This was also the first lesson that I picked up from this film full of great lessons, you have to live your life to the fullest. You shouldn't care what other people think, do it for yourself and do it quick because the clocks ticking. This brings us to our next lesson. Edward Norton plays the main character known as \"the narrator.\" We meet him as a traveling automobile company employee who has insomnia. This character is a very interesting character because he goes through a very large change throughout the movie. Before he meets Tyler Durden he is known as the \"everyman.\" He is emotionally unstable and he tends to put all of his worries and fears into his possessions and he is one of those people who has to hold onto his structure and have everything straight and tidy and it becomes a problem. That is the next lesson, you have to let go. The average human is stuck in a box going about their average days going through their daily cycles until they go to bed, and they could be doing a lot more. \"You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.\" So embrace that and use it to your advantage. Embrace the fact that God may not like you, \"we are God's unwanted children, so be it!\"\rNow let’s talk about Tyler Durden for a second. This guy is indisputably the coolest character in all of movies, ever. You see him and your just like, I want to be him. The best part about him is that he is relatable in the strangest way. I can relate to him although he is completely insane. Even though he is completely insane, he does in a way symbolize all of us, but in our most free state. Tyler Durden is free; he is chaos, which is the exact opposite of Edward Norton. This then ties in with our next theme, freedom. The fight club that is created is in every way illegal, and the whole point of it is to get away from all the rules and your dull and normal life. “At the end of a fight, nothing is resolved yet nothing matters.” That tells you everything you need to know about these people. The first two rules are “you do not talk about Fight Club,” as you probably know. Rules? Yes, there are rules in fight club, but rules are meant to be broken. How can Fight Club spread if no one talks about it? That’s the point; Fight Club thrives on the breaking of its own rules because the whole point of it is to set you free from rules. It’s not even with those first two rules either. In the movie there is a fight between Edward Norton and this other guy and Norton literally beats the living hell out of him breaking the third rule, “when someone says stop, or goes limp the fight is over.” Afterward Norton says that he was feeling destructively beautiful and that’s all that matter in the end.\rFight Club is a movie for the generations. It is a cult masterpiece that will never seize to amaze and disturb its viewers. It is a polarizing film and I am proud to say that I am a part of the following. Never believe that it’s all about the fighting, it’s not. It’s about much, much more than that and even with all the blood and violence; this movie shines as a disturbingly beautiful film. David Fincher does an outstanding job with the directing which is masterful to say the least and the two leads kill it. Plus with a surprise twist that you will never see coming, this movie just brings more and more to the table. A brilliant and yes, beautiful film that I wish to show my children one day.",

Second rule of fight club is YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUB!!!

It may be violent but beneath its in your face approach its thought provokingly smart & daring!! People who dislike it probably couldn't get past the violent scenes when they were fighting but it was basically their way of getting over their failures which is why NO ONE WAS KILLED WHEN THEY FOUGHT EACH OTHER..they hashed out their problems then change their perspectives on their lives by changing the way society functioned as a whole!! I mean come on people....erasing ALL DEBT so everyone has a clean record? That's freaking genius! But still they did commit crimes like vandalism...theft....destroying property but its very entertaining to watch! The way it begins will have you believing that your going to watch a boring movie but it picks up VERY quickly when Edward go's to groups(hilariously funny) meets Karla singer then the show stealer brad Pitt....he's gold in this movie!! Every scene has meaning that will have you thinking...every actor are believable....& its just plain funny as it is serious(I almost died laughing watching Edward Norton kick his own ass @ the end Lamo)whoever says this movie sucks are either sensitive...easily offended...have no funny bone whatsoever or just hates great entertainment!! Brad Pitt: hit me as hard as you can...Edward Norton: like in the face? Brad Pitt: surprise me....Edward Norton: hits brad Pitt.....brad Pitt: ouch...you hit me in the ear man...lamo this is a must movie especially if your interested in seeing how one man decides to change his tedious & extremely repetitive lifestyle....9/10...it loses a point for ending lol",

Fight Club was clever and well written with fantastic performances from Norton And Pitt. Oddly a rather decent performance from Meatloaf as well? Who knew?!?! Aside from the main cast and one or two of the side characters, no one else is really that developed and the movie plays out more like a fantasy than actual events, which contradicts the realistic tone it sets. Breaking the 4th wall is something I love to see in movies and is extremely rare to see in anything that isn't a comedy.  Overall: Fight Club is an utterly brilliant movie that is almost perfect. A few minor flaws here and there, but nothing that really ruins it. A must see.",

The film is about an office worker (Edward Norton) who is unhappy with his current life, however when he meets the rebellious Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), he gains confidence to prove his humanity.Watching Fight Club was without a doubt one of the most unique viewing experiences I've ever had. The film excels in delivering its themes and social commentaries on a human level that the audience can relate with, as we all must dream at some point we can be like a person such as Tyler Durden; confident, no fear and not a care in the world.The film is ultimately a satire (albeit a very dark one) as we see the world through the perspective of Edward Norton's character (known as 'The Narrator'). The audience can relate to both characters of The Narrator and Tyler Durden as they are almost complete opposites of each other, yet we've all felt like both of their characters at some point; we understand these characters and they understand us back. Norton and Pitt also give fantastic performances and you instantly know that these two are the perfect duo.Every time something brutal occurs in Fight Club it has extreme significance; every single punch is each character proving who they are and their humanity, none of it is thrown in just to simply shock the audience. Whenever fights occur, the viewer feels like they're in there with the opponents too. The entire film is a battle, with the opponents fighting physically and characters fighting themselves psychologically as well, with the physical fights being a physical representation of the battles they have within themselves. All of these sorts of things in the film constantly toy with the viewer's emotions due to how close you feel to them.The way the film is directed is brilliant; director David Fincher directs each scene with lots of energy and also includes many interesting details in shots too. Some camera techniques used include focusing simply just on the object directly in front of the camera which works well in scenes with Edward Norton's character, displaying how he feels alone and how there is no world around him. Even scenes like the opening title sequence are directed in a fashion which makes them exciting to watch.Overall, Fight Club is an excellent film that all of us can relate to easily, and can also possibly learn something from too. There's much more to the film than what's on the surface and also much more than I have stated in this review, however plenty of it is amazing to experience yourself while watching the film. Fight Club will definitely stay relevant for many years to come and will continue to toy with people's emotions constantly, and if you haven't seen Fight Club then I don't have a clue what you're doing with your life.8.9/10Yeah, I know I wasn't supposed to talk about it. But it's so good it's impossible not to",

I can only imagine how impressively innovative it must have seemed when it first came out, with its surreally pulsating soundtrack, constant miniature sucker punches, and wildly inspired direction.  The performances are all darkly comical and Nortan's character is an amusingly disturbed individual.  It's not perfect however.  It has a twist ending that descends the story into complete, albeit entertaining, stupidity, it packs on way too much sexually immoral content, and lacks any true meaning despite its constant insistence that it does.  It also slows down too much during some sections.  These flaws would normally sink a movie's score a lot further down and even kill some outright, but Fight club is so entertaining in a hyper macho off kilter sort of way, so well made, and so memorable in ways that few movies can ever achieve that in the end they're not detrimental to the film's overall quality.  I have to say, Fight Club is some sort of flawed, but brilliant classic.  But don't watch it unless you're mature and old enough to not be scarred by some of the film's immoral or violent material.",
