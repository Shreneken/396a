  "critic_reviews": [
    "One of the most curious and perversely brilliant films ever made in the American studio system. It's a shining example of qualities we don't normally see in our big theatrical pictures: vast ambition, huge resources and technical genius mated to a unique and compelling vision of life.",
    "Unique and courageous. It may be counted as one of the year's few steps forward in cinema.",
    "Here is something great and startling -- not necessarily the kind of comforting, consensus-creating film that wins Oscars, but unquestionably a movie that will live in the history of the medium.",
    "Malick's powerful intermingling of brutality and beauty, his signature cutaways to indigenous flora and fauna, and the gentle lyricism of his disjunctive narration and painterly images are too rich to fully register in a single viewing.",
    "The film is a gorgeous garland on an unknown soldier's grave.",
    "Could be called the \"Red Badge of Courage\" of World War II movies.",
    "It's the awesome, metaphysically charged spectacle of man doing terrible things to man within the multicolored and multifarious cathedral of Nature.",
    "As mystical as it is gritty, as despairing as it is detached.",
    "The disturbing ideas it plants in the soil of the soul need time and darkness ? not light ? to germinate.",
    "An intensely internalized portrait of external pandemonium, a slippery, insidiously haunting work of poetry rather than brilliantly realized pulp.",
    "No movie in the last decade has succeeded in psyching out critics and audiences as fully as the powerful, rambling war epic The Thin Red Line.",
    "An art film to the core. If it's an epic, it's an intimate, dream-time epic, an elliptical, episodic film, dependent on images and reveries, that treats war as the ultimate nightmare, the one you just cannot awaken from no matter how hard you try.",
    "Juxtaposes beauty and horror to fashion a savage and lyrical cinematic poem.",
    "Like a Rousseau painting splattered with carnage of warfare.",
    "This may have its occasional dull stretches, but in contrast to \"Saving Private Ryan\" it's the work of a grown-up with something to say about the meaning and consequences of war.",
    "Despite this film's narrative lapses, Malick has a unique way of distilling the poetry from the commonplace -- and for that precious gift we should say amen.",
    "The movie's schizophrenia keeps it from greatness (this film has no firm idea of what it is about), but doesn't make it bad. It is, in fact, sort of fascinating: a film in the act of becoming, a field trial, an experiment in which a dreamy poet meditates on stark reality.",
    "Like no other war movie you've ever seen.",
    "The director is a poet of images.",
    "Although the story seems disjointed at times, no other war movie has tried so valiantly to convey not only the suffering of combat but the awful fissures it leaves between humanity's ideal oneness with itself and the world we live in.",
    "A big, fat, gorgeous, mesmerizing mess.",
    "What Malick has fashioned here is less a conventional narrative than an impressionistic mosaic of our common, yet varied experience of life and death, as focused and clarified through the relentless lens of war.",
    "One more film that could have been helped by excising repetition and focusing performances, but it wanders almost randomly instead. The heart-piercing moments that punctuate its rambling are glimpses of what a tighter film might have been.",
    "An epic aestheticization of World War II, a movie at once bold and baffling, immediate and abstract.",
    "Powerful war spectacle neglects novel's heart and much of story.",
    "Malick dangles his maddeningly innocent ideas about life and death and man's gift for self-destruction.",
    "The Thin Red Line, either by incompetence or willful perversity, dispenses with plot, characterization, dramatic structure and emotional payoffs in favor of the sort of painstakingly composed pictorial diddling that invariably gets critics frothing about the director's \"indelible\" images."

If you watch it for the action you will be totally disappointed. This movie much like Homer's The Iliad; the war is used as a setting for Malick to express his views on human nature in times of tribulation. The movie features pairs of corresponding characters. The cynical Sgt. Welch (Penn) corresponds to the optimistic Pvt. Witt (Caviezel). Witt is considered to be the main character, with his tranquility and hope opposing the basic feelings of ordinary soldiers. The soft-spoken and diligent Captain Staros oftens conflicts with the angry, bloodthristy Col. Tall (Nolte), and their confrontations play a major role in the film. A few other main characters include Pvt. Bell (Chaplin), a man who finds comfort through his love for his wife, and a lieutenant (Cusack) who leads a charge on a bunker. Flashbacks are used to emphasize the character's true emotions. and, when it is all over, the soldiers only realize that this was one island, all their sacrifice given for one island, in a war of many.",

In some ways, I don't really consider it \"about war\" as much as I consider the film to be about ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.  The question that shapes much of theThe Thin Red Line is singularly unique amongst war films.  In some ways, I don't really consider it \"about war\" as much as I consider the film to be about ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.  The question that shapes much of the film is stated by Pvt Witt at the beginning of the film when he reflects upon his mother's death and thinks, \"I wondered what it would be like when I died.  What it would be like to know, that this breath now, was the last one you was ever going to draw.\"  The Thin Red Line defies many conventions, such as the typical convention for a film to have a single protagonist.  The (thin red) lines delineating friend and enemy are cleverly blurred in many ways.  Visually, by casting similair looking men in the three main American roles and casting distinct looking Japanese men as Japanese soldiers.  In the voice-overs, Pvt Witt sees a continuum of life, rather than discrete beings (\"What if all men got one big soul    Another soldier wonders, \"Who are you that lives in all this many forms?\"  Even the lack of a singular protagonist shows how identities are dependent upon each other.\r The Thin Red Line is not a typical war film.  This film is not a celebration of how Americans used violence to defeat the Japanese on Guadalcanal.  The scene that would be a triumphant climax in a typical American war film is emotionally climactic in Malick's The Then Red Line, but it is not a celebration.  Rather, the raid on the Japanese bivouac and winning of the hill is upsetting.\r If you really pay attention to the voice-overs, then I think you have to come to a few conclusions.   Some have criticized the film for being \"heavy handed\" and because the \"director tells you what to think.\"  I think these criticisms are far from the truth.  If you actually pay attention to the film, you'll find that voice-overs contradict each other, or a voice-over contradicts what another character says or does at some point.  The director is simply illustrating that different people have different, often contradictory, points of view.  For example, while two soldiers get into a fist-fight, a voice over states that \"war don't enoble men, it turns them into dogs, poisons the soul.\"  However, anyone watching the film would clearly wonder whether Pvt Witt hadn't been enobled by the war.  Would he really be such a wonderful person if he hadn't gone to war?  Much of the film is ambiguous and contemplative.  There are no easy answers.  When Witt returns to the natives and finds them fighting, notices that they have disease and the skulls of other humans in their huts, the audience is left to wonder if it was Witt's contact with them that made them this way.  Did contact with modern man corrupt these people?  Or did Witt's contact with the violence of the war corrupt his idealization of these people?  I prefer to think that Witt's earlier, idealized view of the natives is what changed, but there is no clear answer given in the film.\r Visually, The Thin Red Line is one of the most beautifully shot films I can ever imagine seeing.  The soundtrack is fantastic.  The sound effects are amazing.  The action sequences are brilliantly done.\r Some have criticized the voice-overs as being \"unrealistic,\" on the basis that combat soldiers don't have time to think such thoughts as expressed in the voice overs.  I think these crticisms are misguided.  The voice-overs used in the film are expressing the thoughts that soldiers in combat have to repress for pragmatic reasons, but these are the important thoughts.  Sure, in combat, soldiers are probably more worried about not getting killed rather than pondering the nature of evil, but the film is about those important thoughts.\r One thing that strikes me about the film is how similar it is to the books, especially From Here to Eternity and The Thin Red Line.  Both are excellent books and indeed some of the lines in the film are taken exactly from the books.  The characters are very similar to those depicted in the books and I think the film captures the spirit of the books very well.\r I think people too often say about films that \"you either love this film or hate it\" but it largely seems to be true of The Thin Red Line.  That being said, I dont believe that people rating it 1/10 genuinely believe it deserves to get a 1/10 rating.  Rather, I believe they are being spiteful and want to bring the rating down to what they think is the \"proper\" rating.  I, however, do genuinely believe this film deserves 10/10.",

Indeed, this is an oft-overlooked area in the war genre (case point: the cardboard character-types in \"Saving Private Ryan\"...).

It questions the underlying origins of hate and villainy and whether we're just flawed beings who're inherently bestowed with a tendency to fight and kill.

He understands cinema is not there to \"tell a story\". That's what books do.He smartly understands that to show the inanity of war, and existence as a whole, he can't go down the easy way, that is the ultra-realistic, audience-pandering and shall we say almost pornographic  \"saving private Ryan\" way.However, he struggles to coherently bring his very good ideas to the screen. Too many voice overs show that he needs words, as a crutch, to help viewers understand his philosophy on war.Few scenes are really \"beautiful\" or will stay with us for long, as Apocalypse Now managed to do. It seems his genius was to cast Jim Caviezel - aka Jesus of passion of the Christ- as his main character, a modern Alexei Karamazov, a soldier-monk, whose blue gaze just illuminates each of his scene with a form of saintly beatitude and echoes his scene in the lagoon.The vast blue yonder, not the thin red line....",

I rarely knew who I was looking at, as the soldiers all looked the same, and even more seldom was the feeling that I should care about them. The voice-over-narrators all sounded the same, all spouting a similar, formulaic monologue to the effect of, \"Who am I? Why are we fighting? Where do thoughts come from?\" When I wasn't bored with the monologue, I was engulfed in a score that lacked any power and swelled when it should have been silent or was silent when it should have swelled. In fact, the characters had no dynamics either. They all acted like scared little boys, both the experienced and those whose first war this was, and it is a wonder they weren't all killed by the Japanese. That would have been impossible, however, as the Japanese were inept at shooting just about everything, not to mention they seemed to enjoy running over the hill towards the enemy, shouting instead of taking up positions and shooting. One shining example of this is when the Americans take Hill 210 and run into the main encampment of the Japanese, much to their surprise. The clearly outnumbered Americans then slaughter nearly every Japanese they can point their gun at while the Japanese simply decide it is better to run away than pick up their guns and fight. This film is misguided and sporadic, having only a vague plot, obscure goals, little to no characterization, and a pace so slow there is time to formulate your own cliche ponderings on life.",

It is as much a film for the actors to spread their wings as it is a commemoration to the American soldiers who lost their lives in the South Pacific.\r There are some truly fantastic and unforgettable performances here, from Nick Nolte, Sean Penn and Jim Cazaviel in particular. They transform faultlessly into their characters, blending into the mise en scene of the film whether the background features long grass (which Malick has always seemed to love) or explosions from incoming Japanese shells.\r Above all, this is a war film to remember for its gritty realism which somehow seamlessly mixes into the poetic direction of Malick.

The scrutiny in here may not be as convoluted but the methodology that it adapts is fascinating to the core. The narrative is strong, layered and thought provoking if not gripping, where its elaborative journey that is of around three hours, is advantageous. The battle sequences are shot with jaw dropping camera work and nail biting choreography that aptly portrays the battlefield of war. The cinematography is metaphorical with neat and clean visuals, live locations and bright colors that lights up the screen like never before. Zimmer's sensational background score and sharp sound effects of all the bullets, explosions, soldiers panting, rivers flowing and birds chirping, every bit of it factors in effectively to the bigger picture. The script might be divided into various sequences whose structure is transparent for the audience, something that may not be feasible for the makers. The performances are mostly scattered in bits and pieces but the show stealers would definitely be Penn, Nolte, Brody and Caviezel. Malick's adaptation is mature since he blends it in with his own ingredients that may not be crispy but is tender and husky to respect the genre and premise. His eerie execution always goes through the roof, since each anticipated emotions does carry out of the screen and rains all over the audience. Cut throating politics, morality conflicts and exceptional one liners that digs in deep are the high points of the feature. Malick's world is not bold and waiting to show off, it is sensible and calculative and as a character quotes in the beginning, \"not everyone is smart enough\". The Thin Red Line might have a weak line but it undeniably is three dimensional and it is inexplicably glorifying to see it come alive.",

Featuring his trademarkWow is all I have to say. After laboring through the other films by Terrence Malick and seeing the potential for a great film if he could ever figure out how to write a damn film, this one brings it all together. Featuring his trademark brilliant cinematography, The Thin Red Line is brilliantly written and beautifully acted turning this one into one of the best war films ever released and one of the strongest films of the 1990s. A character driven film, The Thin Red Line relies upon love, brotherhood, and other true human feelings and emotions rather than blood and carnage to tell the tale of its many characters. The script is beautifully poetic with so many moving lines they are impossible to count. The cast is huge and features many past and current stars in great turns, such as Jim Caviezel, Sean Penn, Elias Koteas, Ben Chaplin, Nick Nolte, Dash Mihok, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Jared Leto, John Travolta, George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, Larry Romano, and many, many more. This is one of the best examples of a film in which every seen features somebody you know and have seen in many different films and it really puts them together for a phenomenal cast. The score to the film is also beautiful and is the last touch to what is really one of the most poetic and brilliant war films ever. Though it gets lost in the shuffle of 1998 due to the release of Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line is fantastic in its own right.",
