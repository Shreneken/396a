  "critic_reviews": [
    "Immensely entertaining and unabashedly inspirational.",
    "With its lack of car chases, fist fights, and over-the-top melodrama, the film has to rely on solid acting, an intelligent script, and capable directing.",
    "One of the best elements of the movie is in breaking free, he is respecting his father. This movie has deep values.",
    "At its best, the movie evokes that blend of thrill and terror that comes from mixing two chemicals together without being sure that an instant later you'll still be standing there in one piece.",
    "It makes a great point: Love, honor and respect your father, but then get the hell out of town.",
    "A professionally crafted family film that reserves all its challenging moments for its characters, letting the audience bask comfortably in the approach of a predetermined warm and fuzzy ending.",
    "This film is family.",
    "The film is rich in period flavor and refreshingly unhip.",
    "While this movie hasn't many surprises, it does offer strong performances, especially from Gyllenhaal.",
    "Here's hoping other filmmakers will follow its spirit, if not all of its methods.",
    "Duller than rocket science and more reliant on formulas.",
    "Now if that isn't an inspirational story, it's hard to know what is.",
    "Paint-by-numbers feel-gooder, in which Homer and his friends decide to win a national science fair for their little town and, ultimately, for America.",
    "Despite its \"based on a true story\" opening credit, this earnest, nostalgic film has a way of seeming too good to be true.",
    "The movie manages to push buttons without seeming formulaic.",
    "Cooper who was so poignant in \"Lone Star,\" gives an emotionally robust performance.",
    "Offers a strange mix of sentimentality and social criticism, sometimes mixing the two to awkward effect.",
    "The film's most fully realized performance is Chris Cooper's.",
    "October Sky falls flat (despite its rich tone and some startling cinematography by Fred Murphy) due to its all-too-obvious third act and the vague fact that, really, not that much happens.",
    "October Sky may be set around coal mines, but ultimately it's Field of Corn, Part II."

I can honestly say that after watching Joe Johnston's \"October Sky\" I feel a whole lot better about everything. Truly just an overwhelmingly inspiring and uplifting film. I mean you could take the most cynical, mysanthropic soul on this planet, have him watch \"October Sky\", and he'd have a healthier outlook on his life. I swear, during the last 10 minutes of this movie, I had the biggest **** grin on my face - one of those endings you just can't help but get caught up in. The film features an abundant amount of fine performances. Namely, Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Homer Hickam, and Chris Cooper's compelling turn as his father, John. Other great performances came from Laura Dern, Chris Owen, William Lee Scott, and Chad Lindberg. The movie is shot to a magnificent degree. For instance, Cinematographer Fred Murphy really uses dismal lighting to magnify the miserable atmosphere within Coalwood, West Virginia. The movie is also edited to a tee. \"October Sky\"",

The story is very beautiful, despite overcoming the prejudices and limitations they had at the time, beyond the relationship between father and son that he shows in a way pretty intense. I was impressed with the performance of Jake aged at 19, won me over. And priceless the first scene of Jake Gyllenhaal and Chad Lindberg in the car listening to Jailhouse Rock by Elvis! Great movie, it's gripping and fun at the same time... and why not, it is also stimulating, encouraging. Well worth seeing!",
