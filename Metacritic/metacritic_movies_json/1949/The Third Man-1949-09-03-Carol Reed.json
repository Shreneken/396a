    "critic_reviews": [
        "Of all the movies I have seen, this one most completely embodies the romance of going to the movies.",
        "Throughout the film the sense of Vienna as a frazzled echo of its glorious past is underpinned by Reed's greatest trouvaille \u2013 the discovery of Anton Karas's zither melodies, used as the only musical accompaniment. Half-jaunty, half-melancholic, they epitomise, like the film itself, a world gone sadly to seed.",
        "This will haunt you. The style, the plot, the character and of course ...that tune...",
        "A noir classic.",
        "A triumph of disparate tones, colors and intentions. Like many, I have loved this thriller of conscience and betrayal most of my moviegoing life...Its brand of romantic fatalism is particularly seductive to teenage males, I think, and those who never fully recover from that moviegoing state of being.",
        "Mr. Reed has brilliantly packaged the whole bad of his cinematic tricks, his whole range of inventive genius for making the camera expound. His eminent gifts for compressing a wealth of suggestion in single shots, for building up agonized tension and popping surprises are fully exercised. His devilishly mischievous humor also runs lightly through the film, touching the darker depressions with little glints of the gay or macabre. [3 Feb 1950, p.29]",
        "It's an exciting experience, dazzling and entertaining and thought-provoking. I saw it at Cinema 21 last week and immediately wanted to see it again. I couldn't, so I started researching and read everything I could about it. It's truly great.",
        "Supporting characters turn in excellent portrayals. Camera work on an exceptionally high plane, and in his painstaking direction Carol Reed lives up to his high reputation.",
        "The Third Man finally endures because it offers a simple thing that so many modern films neglect: the power of story...Revolutionary film noir with a clutch of stunning central turns.",
        "What has perhaps been lost over the years, however, is the cultural freshness and vitality of Reed\u2019s masterpiece...The Third Man is important not just because of its technique but because of its theme.",
        "Although he\u2019s only on screen for a fraction of the film\u2019s running time, Lime (Welles) stands out as one of the screen\u2019s most chilling embodiments of the banality of evil, and a perfect stand-in for Third Man\u2019s vision of moral breakdown in post-WWII Europe.",
        "One of the best-ever examples of film noir to come out of all of Europe. The Third Man has all the right ingredients: an engaging, twisty storyline (written by Graham Greene); one of the most diabolical and charismatic villains ever to grace the screen; crisp, innovative directing (by the underrated Carol Reed); a score (by Anton Karas) that it as unforgettable as it is unconventional; and cinematography (by Robert Krasker) that uses the black-and-white medium to its fullest. Not only is The Third Man a darling of the critics, but it has been embraced with glee by the general populace for more than five decades.",
        "It\u2019s a film \u2014 and a city \u2014 to get lost in, and it\u2019ll haunt you afterward, like a face you thought you recognized under a streetlamp, before it disappeared.",
        "The Third Man is best seen as his romantic fantasy; we\u2019d have to wait decades before another awkward scribbler, also a fish out of water, plunged helplessly into a misadventure. His name was Barton Fink.",
        "A gripping, beautifully structured picture and a tour de force from British director Carol Reed...It's hard to choose just one scene to sum up this poetic thriller, but the legendary scene on the ferris wheel may best represent its perfect blend of great writing, acting, and directing. The fadeout, too, is unforgettable.",
        "Riddled with post-war despair, The Third Man is one of the great British movies. The zither music, the noirish cinematography, the taut writing and the raft of excellent performances combine in an engrossing thriller that matches America's finest.",
        "Krasker\u2019s camera reveals a dank, matte, defeated city \u2014 so dully vivid as to be a character unto itself \u2014 except that this Vienna becomes something altogether different seen at night or underground. In that velvety shadowscape, even rubble and sewage look glamorous.",
        "Welles\u2019s presence, so radiant, so enthralling, so unapologetically egotistical, is all the more wondrous when you consider that Harry Lime was nearly played by someone else.",
        "But the thing about Carol Reed's 1949 The Third Man was that no matter how many times I saw it over the years its magic never failed. Its sophisticated, world-weary glamour never lost its allure. The movie only got richer as my own experiences got richer. I kept discovering dark new delights, and the classic moments remained every bit as classic.",
        "The Third Man remains among the most consummate of British thrillers: Reed and Greene\u2019s sardonic vision of smiling corruption is deliciously realised with superb location work, a roster of seasoned Viennese performers and the raised eyebrow of Anton Karas\u2019 jaunty zither score.",
        "A sharp, exciting thriller that beautifully captures a dispirited Europe nowhere near recovered from WWII, Carol Reed's The Third Man is one of those miraculous films that work on every level.",
        "It isn't easy when you're up against the likes of Reed, writer Graham Greene, and producer David O. Selznick, but Welles still manages to dominate this 1949 film, both as an actor and as a stylistic influence. What's missing is the Welles content.",
        "A peculiarly hollow, centerless blend of theatre and literature, from which what\u2019s missing, for the most part (though not entirely), is precisely the cinema...It isn\u2019t so much that The Third Man is a bad movie\u2014far from it. But it\u2019s far from being a great one, too."

These narrative attributes are thanks in no small part to master storyteller and novelist Graham Greene, who penned the film's screenplay. This is a project that takes great pride in its slow burn approach, offering up a veneer of normalcy to the viewer, but with little nuances in the dialogue, tonality and camerawork to let you know something's not quite right here. Once the reveals come, though, I'll say I had a consistently pervasive smile on my face. Any and every scene with Orson Welles is nothing short of iconic. That's not to take away from Joseph Cotten's commendable lead turn. It's just that, with the way the movie sets everything up involving Welles character, you really can't help but leave the screening remembering every scene involving him. And, while I will admit that I personally didn't care for the score (it is admittedly good music, but I also felt it didn't really fit the tone and mood of the film overall), this is still a fantastic watch.",

And even though this uncertain shady streets follows a typical cat and mouseTrust Or Mistrust.The Third ManReed's impressive tricks on hiding the trump card right under your nose has old magic and familiar structure hidden in there. And even though this uncertain shady streets follows a typical cat and mouse chase, unfortunately there seems to be very little skin in the game on terms of narration. And despite of the fact that the storyline suggests the inseparable chemistry between the lead characters, there is very little romance among the antics. Plummeting downwards by an immense pressure of almost overstuffed material, Reed seems to be in some sort of hurry to catch up the next act. In order to do so, it achieves a ferocious pace but doesn't quite glorifies the thrills and stakes of the circumstances.The makers could have easily milked out more cinema by savoring the concept and slowing down the procedure for a better effect. Nevertheless these minor complications can easily be leapt over by a gripping thriller that it maps out on screen. Welles as the ultimate flip of the act, has unfortunately a one dimension side of his to portray, and yet with spooky expressive performance, he sticks the landing. Cotten as the leader that we all follow, the victim, the protagonist, has fairly much wider room to factor in along with Valli's love angle.No matter how thought provoking and absorbing Reed's world is, it certainly is too mechanical to bubble up as a free spirit. There are too many strings tied for it to be independent of the traffic which at times holds it back; the semantics is the double edged sword, both productive and consuming. The donated blood and sweat of Reed pays off for his meticulous execution that still holds up after decades. The Third Man is the pre-war inquisitive concept that is held by an equally opposite competitive action.",
