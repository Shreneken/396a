  "critic_reviews": [
    "Popular filmmaking at its smartest and most persuasive.",
    "The fact that David Helfgott lived the outlines of these events--that he triumphed, that he fell, that he came slowly back--adds an enormous weight of meaning to the film.",
    "Delivers a full emotional palette without undue sentimentalizing.",
    "This is unbelievably rich material, and I can say without reservation that Scott Hicks' work deserves the highest recognition. Shine truly does what its name says.",
    "It's a film which aims to persuade us of its truth without props or signposts--and it does so with unforgettable beauty.",
    "The movie does what any great musician should: It lifts an idea to the heights of ecstasy; it sells its song.",
    "An unconventional biopic about a brilliant young pianist.",
    "A sublimely uplifting movie.",
    "Hard to take in its particulars.",
    "Thanks to fine acting and its vividly unconventional protagonist, it pumps fresh blood into a conventional formula.",
    "Memorable, deeply affecting movie.",
    "The high-powered drive of both the storytelling and the music is riveting.",
    "Fortunately, Hicks's direction has an elegance and dignity that rescue Shine from the exploitative and give the film an acute, genuinely sensitive style.",
    "If, at times, Shine's luster reveals more elbow grease than internal radiance, the movie is still a moving tribute to the human capacity to overcome all odds.",
    "Shine has a story to reckon with and powerhouse male performances.",
    "Feel-good tone notwithstanding (and creepy to boot), there are nagging riddles about the Helfgott story that the film has neither the nerve nor the sense to tackle.",
    "The gaga uplift in Shine knocks the malaise right out of your head--along with just about everything else.",
    "Ceases to be a cogent study of the disease of genius and devolves into two lesser creatures: an ordinary weepie and an Oscar contender.",
    "The movie is meant to be uplifting and to the degree that you can ignore its unquestioning treatment of mental illness, I suppose it is."

So many times are mentally handicapped people- whether having been born that way or later becoming so- portrayed in a very cookie cutter way. I am Sam and The Other Sister come to mind- although these two films are both great in their own respect and fulfill a very important role, Shine goes the route that desperately needed to be explored. I think one thing that sets this apart for me was the format. We don't follow the younger David only to be told *Shock!* he suffers a mental setback! We're not focusing on the fact, either. This film is about the man behind the talent, and the talent that fronts a mental ilness that proved to be David's challenge in place of possibly poverty or a physical disability. We explore the diversity of a character instead of getting pre-occupied by his set-backs. I would say, for me, this missed the 10/10 because it's so very much a product of it's time. Of course, the time stamp is inevitable, but there have been great films that have transcended that- this one did not. But still an amazing piece of art, when all is said and done.",

C'est l'occasion de voir évidemment un véritable prodige soumettre le piano et en faire de l'art et de l'or à l'état pur. Cela ne sauve pas le film mais ça aide à faire passer.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nI found the story very interesting, quite sad but certainly (to me anyway) quite fascinating. I've always had a passion for music and wish I could play, being quite a creative person, if I do say so myself. I've also seen a fair few film depictions of people who are brought up in strict households with what you could call stage parents and who struggle with belonging, identity and adolescence in general in teen years. The fact that the film is based on a true story made me even more interested to see how things played out (pardon the slight pun).The parents come across as both harsh and suspicious towards others who show a keen interest in David's musical talent, as well as protective and perhaps nurturing. Initially I was in two minds about who ultimately had David's best interests at heart, given worries about potential exploitation and so on but I won't go in to any detail here. I felt the characters were portrayed particularly well, as it all seemed very raw, gritty and just realistic somehow. I felt a mix of emotions for David but primarily sadness for the predicament he found himself in. He clearly had certain issues which weren't being properly addressed, were overlooked or ignored, obviously to his detriment. David appears and sounds a very introverted, sensitive man, trying to find his place and come to terms with the hand he's been dealt, you could say. Cast wise, Geoffrey Rush portrays David as an adult, who comes across as somewhat of a stooped, unassuming man, who is ignored by many until he's put in front of a piano. Davids father is played by Armin Mueller-Stahl, who comes across as both very protective and very strict.There is, unsurprisingly, a lot of piano instrumentation played during the film, which helps to lift, if briefly, the tone of the rather sombre themes it covers (those of perfectionism, abuse, expression via the creative arts perhaps?). I this was a very thought provoking film, it didn't come across to me as a big budget Hollywood-style film - for one, its an Australian film, having been filmed and most likely financed in Australia and so on but it doesn't really consist of big breathtaking panoramas, no special effects or the like. In a way it has a semi-documentary feel to it. There are a mix of uplifting moments and scenes and more almost suffocating ones, if that makes any sense.I felt this film had a lot of heart about it, it felt like a very raw, quite tense and certainly a gritty depiction of one mans battle with his superior talent. Among the emotions I felt while watching this film were worry, joy and sadness. I feel that this film covers some sensitive areas (see the themes I've already mentioned in passing earlier on) and it does so quite well. Content wise, there are some moderately disturbing scenes, where violence is hinted at, although there is no real graphic violence and only mildly strong language used. Sex scenes are mildly hinted at, although again nothing graphic is shown. As far as plot pace is concerned, I didn't feel that the story at any point felt like it was dragging, that the plot was dragging on too long or becoming in any way 'stale'. It has a total running time of around about an hour and three quarters, so its not an especially long film - well, by today's standards anyway. I suppose it covers a fair bit of ground in such a relatively short amount of time.Its a bit hard to explain exactly why this is the case, without including at least minor spoilers (which I always try my best to avoid) but it felt like the sort of film that would stay with me for a fair while after watching it. It has a powerful emotional side to it and thats what makes it quite gripping, mainly in the characterisation I suppose I'd say, if quizzed. You can hear the emotion, the personal expression that David works so hard to put across in his piano recitals, which is touching in as much as he's quite a reserved and (as I already mentioned) introverted individual. I suppose you could also say that its quite a claustrophobic film in a way. I apologise if you feel I'm giving too much away in terms of (hopefully mild) spoilers and the like, I do try to avoid those but as I say its hard to express my opinions and otherwise review such a film, without covering certain ground. I certainly found this to be both a gripping and emotional watch all in all and I feel the film was well made.Yes, of course I'd recommend it. I feel this film did very well at portraying such an individual as David, with both his personal issues and superior musical talent, plus his difficult background and upbringing. It is quite an emotional watch, it has some uplifting scenes and some upsetting scenes. Its also quite thought provoking and covers some sensitive themes, such as perfectionism and introverted self expression, very well.",
