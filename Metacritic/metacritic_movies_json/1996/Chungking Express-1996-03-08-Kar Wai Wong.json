The first half deals with Cop 223, who has broken up with his girlfriend of five years. He purchases a tin of pineapples with an expiration date of May 1 each day for a month. By the end of that time, he feels that he will either be rejoined with his love or that it too will have expired forever.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "Chungking Express ravishingly, seductively exudes the immediacy of everyday life as its spins its classically timeless tales of love lost and almost regained.",
    "The performances here are irresistible, thrilling in their invention and spontaneity, as is the mind-blowing, urgent cinematography of frequent Wong collaborator Christopher Doyle, which makes the most of Hong Kong's neon-drenched streets and cramped interior spaces.",
    "To Wong, love isn't something you can talk about; words are inadequate, empty, inevitably reductive. Love is something you see, sense, feel, and Chungking Express is one of Wong's purest evocations of its excitement and heartbreak.",
    "Wong infuses his films with style and energy. His hand-held camera is restless, always moving and shifting. The action sequences are punctuated with unusual shots and stop-motion jumps. By filming Chungking Express in such rich, vibrant manner, the director uses visual images to underscore his themes.",
    "This is filmmaking of high energy and wit. What it adds up to is debatable. You can view it as a bright twist on the being-a-cop-is-lonely sort of police picture, or as a mini-anthology of quirky not-quite-love stories. If it's hard to say where Chungking Express arrives, the trip is still exhilarating.",
    "Chungking Express is a breezy little Hong Kong movie that has more life, energy, humanity and sheer visual zing than most other shows you'll see in a month or so. And, an hour after watching it, you may indeed be hungry for more. Not necessarily because the show is shallow or unsatisfying, or doesn't leave a strong impression, but because the spontaneity and high energy of it is what's so much fun.",
    "Whatever ineffable thing Wong Wong Kar-wai does—let’s call it despondent extravagance—he distilled it into its purest form with Chungking Express.",
    "This is the kind of movie you'll relate to if you love film itself, rather than its surface aspects such as story and stars. It's not a movie for casual audiences, and it may not reveal all its secrets the first time through, but it announces Wong Kar-Wai, its Hong Kong-based director, as a filmmaker in the tradition of Jean-Luc Godard.",
    "A lyrical and delightfully goofy study in romantic longing.",
    "Overall, Wong’s movie doesn’t leave as big a wash behind it as the more ambitious “Days” and his “Mean Streets”-like debut, “As Tears Go By,” but it’s an enjoyable cruise.",
    "While its slender, two-tiered plot links love affairs that happen largely by accident, the film's real interest seems to lie in raffish affectation. Mr. Wong has legitimate visual flair, but his characters spend an awful lot of time playing impish tricks.",
    "For all Wong's energy and virtuosity, the relentless stylishness and whimsicality of Chungking Express become irritating. The cast is appealing -- particularly the forlorn young cops. But the velocity of Wong's attack seems out of proportion to the airy, lightweight quality of the stories."

Showing how one can be distressed and left hurt by looking to the past andA truly sad and depressing film, Wong Kar-wai's Chungking Express is an exploration of loneliness, focused in on two men looking for love in the past in Hong Kong. Showing how one can be distressed and left hurt by looking to the past and waiting for it to change, Chungking Express features characters that are so incredibly real, the emotion they communicate cannot be ignored.\r With incredibly written dialogue, Chungking Express brings its two lonely men to life with lines that absolutely touch your soul. For example, one describes how a girl who wished him a happy birthday will live on in his memories forever, only to then wonder when a memory expires. Lines such as these will overcome inadequacies in the film as a whole, as they transcend the medium. Instead, it makes the experience feel incredibly real and authentic. Wong Kar-wai's film may feel as though it is occurring at a distance from the audience, but lines such as these make the film realize that there is no distance at all. This is not a romance film, rather it is one about lost love and the pain it can cause. As such, it is an incredibly cold film, but not emotionless.\r Stylistically, the film uses a ton of hand-held camera, if not solely hand-held. The end result is a kinetic and chaotic experience that highlights the loneliness of its protagonists. As the city and even their lives (as cops) run around hectically, their love life and home life remain empty and filled with solitude. It is always lovely when a director's style matches some element of the film and offers its own thematic elements. This is very much the case with Chungking Express. Additionally, the film is just simply very well shot. Hand-held cameras can be quite nauseating and annoying when noticeable, yet Chungking Express deftly avoids these trappings and instead utilizes the style effectively. Essentially, it is supposed to put you into the scene. The camera does this here, but certainly not always.\r A thoroughly melancholy and moving experience, Chungking Express will make you feel its characters loneliness in a very human way that will more than likely break your heart. Both this and In the Mood for Love (the other Wong Kar-Wai film I have seen), both have this quality that make you think they will be a romance film and certainly play out like a romance film should, but they are anything but romance films. Rather, they are explorations of love and what it does to a person once they feel it and how they feel when it is ripped out of their clutches.",

Faye Wong is delightful; truly the Chinese version of the manic pixie dream girl (if you didn't realize it, that's her covering The Cranberries Dreams).

Avec le temps, en vérité ça ne s'est pas arrangé et ce Chungking sonne bien creux et encore plus bidon qu'auparavant, ses défauts nous sautant au visage de façon extrêmement flagrante... Surtout que seule la moitié du film est regardable, à savoir la seconde histoire...La première histoire se borne à nous faire suivre la Miss \"lunettes de soleil\" qui tire la gueule et trafique de la poudre avec des immigrés indiens avant de se faire elle-même poursuivre par un jeune premier qu'on met un certain temps à reconnaître... le plus chinois des acteurs japonais, Takeshi Kaneshiro ! c'était encore un débutant à l'époque.La seconde histoire voit un flic incarné par l'excellent et déjà connu Tony Leung, poursuivi à l'insu de son ignorance par l'employée d'une gargotte qui n'écoute que de la musique de merde. Cette musique pourrie est d'ailleurs répétée à l'envi et quasiment en boucle et vrille bien les nerfs comme il faut... comme un leitmotiv romanesque d'une lourdeur sans commune mesure.Si ce jeu du chat et de la souris est déjà nettement plus mignon -certains diront poétique ?- vu que le flic déconvenu et plaqué par son hôtesse de l'air parle aux objets- il n'en reste pas moins pataud et trop chiant pour espérer convaincre. Finalement, on a donc une moitié de film totalement ratée et une autre très nunuche qui nous les casse. Quel échec !",

The premise of two romances centered around a small food stand is pretty cool, it feels like that it could have been a short series even. It's a quirky film with two comical, almost manga ridiculous interests and it's cool to see stuff that's clearly out of the norm once in a while. I feel that the switch up of stories in the middle of the movie kept it fresh as well. It seems to have held up well even 26 years later.",
