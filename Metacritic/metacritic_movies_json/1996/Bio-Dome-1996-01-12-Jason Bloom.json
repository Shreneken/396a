  "summary": "Five brave scientists are forced to face life forms more perplexing, more terrifying, more annoying than anything they've ever encountered: Pauly Shore and Stephen Baldwin. (MGM)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Even with the low expectations any reasonable viewer brings to a Shore flick, this rates only stupid-plus. The bongs-and-pajamas set, though, should be riveted.",
    "A potentially amusing comic premise -- dropping a pair of anarchic stoners into the spaced-out, sanctimonious world of New Age bio-dome enthusiasts -- gets submerged in a shower of witless gags and the feeble one-joke persona of MTV celebrity Pauly Shore.",
    "Shore possesses only two talents -- his ability to assume yoga-like positions and fondle his own behind, and his mystifying knack for getting starring roles in bad movies.",
    "Pauly Shore is less a comedian than a class clown, and his dim-witted mugging makes Jim Carrey's antics seem creative triumphs by comparison. Vapid, vulgar, and more to the point, not funny.",
    "A nonstop moronathon... Bio-Dome offers a pants-load of poop and masturbation jokes, deviant innuendo and simian sight gags destined to gross out and offend just about everyone.",
    "This film may set an all-time record for shortest time between the big screen and your local video store.",
    "Neither the script nor direction lives up to the concept, and the picture evolves into a \"Bio\"-degradable hash rather than a zany sendup of potent issues and serious intents gone awry.",
    "[Shore] seems convinced that the antics of his retarded persona amount to some manner of postmodernist anti-comedy and this makes the resultant boredom seem all the more pathetic.",
    "The sheer ineptitude of the movie is supposed to be funny, but there's no lunacy behind it: Shore and his writers are like comedians on Prozac, smiling through the fart jokes without a hint of desperation."

But, I put it in a class of movies with the likes of Idiocracy: they aimed for laughs and ended up with a rather poignant commentary on the state of the world and associated attitudes. There are a lot of crude jokes in Bio-Dome, to be sure, but then, that's Pauly Shore's style. If you go into this movie thinking something else, you have no business critiquing movies (or any form of entertainment). I found the movie \"funny enough\". As for what the movie was trying to tell people, obviously the message got lost on a lot of people. Even the people that society views as degenerates can help foster change. The movie presents stoners that just want to party, but then they have a moment of clarity that allows them to see how they aren't contributing anything. Shore's speech about \"now we can show the world how to fix things from where we really are\" versus living in some kind of perfect world that doesn't exist made this movie AT LEAST a 5/10 on any scale. Voting it lower shows that someone was unable to see past the facade of the movie for the message. I remember someone telling me once \"don't judge a book by its cover\". Well, so-called professional critics, you would do well to heed that advice and rate movies more accurately and with less judgment.",

Then you pick up a job lot of old VHS and find one of these films then feel a strange urge to take another look, maybe there is something you missed........let's be completely honest from the get-go, Pauly Shore is Marmite, hated by most. Stephen Baldwin is the brother everyone forgets. William Atherton was still dining out on Die Hard. It's all a big melting pot of facets that don't work, and they didn't in 1996.But it does in 2018. It's a stupid film, it's a film only to be watched when you want to watch something stupid. Think of it like Wayne's World, it's a riot of stereotypical nineties grungey nonsense that you don't want to relate with but still somehow do.We live in a world today where everything always seems so serious and everything always seems like it is beset by problems. We originally thought films like this were garbage simply because there were a lot more things that were funny in those days. It's not like that today so watch something like Bio-Dome, it's only 95 minutes of your life. You might cringe because you see a bit of yourself on the screen, but you were fun back then and I bet you are less fun now.End",

If you need an April Fool's prank lock your friend in a room playing Bio-Dome (actually that is probably way to cruel). Look, if the premise interests you I don't think that my review is going sway you to not watch it, but remember, you have been warned. I remember reading a positive review for Bio-Dome once and it was talking about how it is really  poignant with social commentary. I'm sorry, but that had to be from a former producer. This movie is not like that at all in fact it only sends negative messages across. This film centers around two idiotic stoners who just watch TV all day, yet they have a nice house and beautiful girlfriends. Throughout the film these guys are the hero's, while the head intellectual scientist, who is only trying to do his job, turns into an insane \"Heart of Darkness\" esque villain. The other intellectual scientists become helpless as their years of education make them feeble to two guys who bite each others toenails. By the way they are the two who caused all the problems.  When one is trying to create social commentary about the environment one should have the audience connect with what is happening. Instead we have a couple of idiots doing with the IQ of bread do all the environmental damage. Instead of having the viewer reflect his or her own actions he or she will probably think, \"look its only stupid people who can hurt the environment\" or \"it's dumb stoners who cause all pollution\"  because those are the exact messages the filmmakers convey.",
