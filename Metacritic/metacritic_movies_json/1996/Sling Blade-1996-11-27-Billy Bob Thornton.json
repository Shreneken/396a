He returns to the southern town of his youth, where his quiet, gentle manner and simple charm land him a job and lead him to an unlikely friendship with a young boy (Black) and his widowed mother.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "A story that's startling, soulful and absolutely unforgettable.",
    "Like the eloquent, darkly funny dialogue, the film's characters, setting and cadences draw us into its world, with all its terrors and tenderness. What emerges is a masterpiece of Southern storytelling that draws a sharp line between good and evil.",
    "Perhaps the most remarkable thing here is Thornton's nuanced performance, but the film has other rare virtues: all the characters are fully and richly fleshed out (with some unexpected turns by John Ritter and singer Dwight Yoakam), and the story's construction is carefully measured.",
    "Catches you up so firmly in its world that you find yourself accepting whatever Thornton presents right up to its deeply ironic finish.",
    "Takes you down paths full of primitive, almost biblical implications, but it also finds comic relief in moments of palpable tension.",
    "Sling Blade is perhaps the year's most impressive debut because it is an uncompromisingly told tale with a minimum of frills.",
    "Thornton, who wrote, directed, and stars in Sling Blade, has created an unforgettable character and situation, a film that's sure to become an American classic.",
    "There is pain, humor, irony and sweetness in the character, and a voice and manner so distinctive, he is the most memorable movie character I've seen in a long time.",
    "Resonates like the best of Southern fiction.",
    "What evolves among them is a kind of realistic fairy tale, sustained by the sweet gravity and guttural, deadpan minimalism of Thornton's performance.",
    "Marked by some powerful scenes, fine performances and colorful dialogue, this talented directorial debut by actor-writer Billy Bob Thornton has its effectiveness diluted by serious overlength and a rather monotonous, unmodulated tone.",
    "A remarkably moving and disturbing film about the possibility of belonging and the genealogy of violence.",
    "Builds slowly but passionately, not dancing to some Hollywood tune, but finding its characters where they are and letting them be who they are.",
    "Billy Bob Thornton wrote, directed and stars in this compassionate, occasionally funny, character-driven movie about a mentally unstable man who takes the best interests of children very seriously.",
    "The narrative is little more than a flimsy envelope -- it's the men and women who are sealed within that make Sling Blade worth watching.",
    "It's Thornton's rough and nuanced performance as Karl, not his modest filmmaking skills, that sucks you so quickly into Sling Blade's vortex.",
    "The atmosphere is Southern Gothic pure enough to do Carson McCullers proud -- grotesque, sentimental and dankly nasty -- and Thornton manages not to undermine his own writing.",
    "I can't help thinking, though, that maybe Thornton was too ambitious in trying to wear three hats.",
    "Thornton is sadly affecting in the film's central role."

Although it's very intense in places and really puts you on edge with heightened emotion and great acting, it leaves you feeling warm and with a refreshed love of humanity. Thornton's performance is so hauntingly amazing that you hardly even recognise him as Carl. His entire body and persona becomes transformed, more so than any other actor playing any part I've seen. The young Lucas Black gives a phenomenal performance as Frank as well. He's just so natural. I really can't praise this film enough. Thornton is a genius in my eyes and it's perfectly clear how he managed to bag himself Angelina Jolie at one point.",

Billy Bob Thornton is impeccable in the lead role here and it is truly a performance that makes me sit there and wonder if I had him all wrong all this time. Maybe he is a great actor. He is also quite the talent as a director and writer as this one is beautifully scripted and paced to perfection. His performance as the mentally slow Karl stands tall though as the best thing about this film, though the performances of everyone else here are also top-of-the-line. The characters are perfectly put together and their relationships feels entirely authentic. The film also feels incredibly Southern, which gives it a great authenticity on that front. A touching, well made, and at times thrilling film, Sling Blade is predictable at times and if you do not figure out how this one will end, you need to rewind and watch it again because you are not paying close enough attention. Yet, in spite of that, it is still a great film featuring an absolutely impeccable performance from Thornton as he proves his ability as an actor, director, and writer.",

Those movies are real jems that needs to be cherished. This movie makes you be thankful for the life you have, because his live was so bad. Every moment is tear jerking whether by happiness or sadness. At the end he knew what he had to did and he sadly did it.
