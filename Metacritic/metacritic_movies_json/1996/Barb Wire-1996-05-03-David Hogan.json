  "critic_reviews": [
    "David Hogan keeps the action moving and loaded with fights, gun battles and other action-trashy thrills. Lee is terrific.",
    "Lee elevates herself from the lower echelon of mere international super-babedom to the loftier realm of pulp myth. She is \"It\" with an exclamation mark.",
    "Despite its obvious flaws, Barb Wire does what it sets out to do and does it well.",
    "The filmmakers must have known they were not making a good movie, but they didn't use that as an excuse to be boring and lazy. Barb Wire has a high energy level, and a sense of deranged fun.",
    "It's a comic book movie in the broadest sense of the term, and although it's neither as emotionally resonant as \"The Crow\" nor as surreally goofy as \"Tank Girl,\" Barb Wire still manages to get you going, Anderson Lee fan or not.",
    "This rusted-future comic strip comes at you in shards -- exhaustingly derivative images of mayhem and titillation, with Lee, in her bad-girl bondage gear, as its blank vixen. If you didn't call her babe, she wouldn't exist.",
    "Ought to be disreputable fun. Instead it ends up, all its explosions and exposed flesh notwithstanding, rather inert.",
    "Isn't much when it comes to either deliberate or inadvertent humor. But it does have a few amusing moments.",
    "Its main source is a comic book, but it might as well be a computer.",
    "Compared to this brash, lunkheaded vehicle for \"Baywatch\" star Pamela Anderson Lee, the Barb Wire graphic novels are masterpieces of subtlety and narrative restraint.",
    "The element of high camp that makes for enjoyable \"good trash\" isn't present.",
    "A convoluted mess, but there have been worse.",
    "Muddled futuristic thriller.",
    "Numbingly violent action."

The film opens with Pamela Anderson on stage in some club or something with music playing, soaking wet with water spraying around her and over her, wearing some outfit with her boobs poking out then an observer calls her \"Babe\" and she throws one of her heels at his head, killing him... The film has many action scenes and probably some fighting scenes and it's violent but the storyline makes no sense and the acting isn't great to be honest. There's some scene when some fat slob is introduced to us on the back of some vehicle and he's bloody huge in obesity size and is completely a ridiculously scene. We see scenes of Barb Wire (Pamela Anderson)  showing the odd bit of flesh but this would of been better if she showed more of her body. Instead we saw hints of her body and her in some hot tub or something and that along with the action scenes didn't feel great if I'm honest. The action scenes could of been better and the overall film and some of the characters were laughable and silly, even the villains. This is probably one of the worst movies ever made and very stupid",
