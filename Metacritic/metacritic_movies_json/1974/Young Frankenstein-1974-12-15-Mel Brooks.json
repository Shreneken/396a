  "critic_reviews": [
    "In addition to just being side-splittingly funny, Young Frankenstein is an aesthetic triumph.",
    "If Mel Brooks has a masterpiece, it’s this homage to the Universal horror movies of the 1930s and ’40s.",
    "There are few comedies in Hollywood history more universally beloved than the likes of Mel Brooks’ Young Frankenstein, but perhaps the most impressive thing about that adoration is the fact that for many viewers it was earned without anything more than the barest conception of how effective a parody the film truly is.",
    "Mel Brooks is home with Young Frankenstein, his most disciplined and visually inventive film (it also happens to be very funny).",
    "Brooks's most accomplished work, combining his well-known brand of comedy with stylish direction and a uniformly excellent cast.",
    "Young Frankenstein (1974) and High Anxiety are as much loving homage as irreverent spoof.",
    "As played by Gene Wilder in Mel Brooks's funniest, most cohesive comedy to date, this Dr. Frankenstein is a marvelous addled mixture of young Tom Edison, Winnie-the-Pooh, and your average Playboy reader with a keen appreciation of beautiful bosoms.",
    "Young Frankenstein emerges as a reverently satirical salute to the 1930s horror film genre.",
    "A perfect example of early Brooks firing on all spoofily comedic cylinders.",
    "Longer on charm and cheer than on humor of knee-pounding hilarity...the funniest film of the season by default.",
    "It isn’t a dialogue comedy; it’s visceral and lower. It’s what used to be called a crazy comedy, and there hasn’t been this kind of craziness on the screen in years. It’s a film to go to when your rhythm is slowed down and you’re too tired to think. You can’t bring anything to it (Brooks’ timing is too obvious for that) ; you have to let it do everything for you, because that’s the only way it works.",
    "More about the myth of Karloff than the monster, this Mel Brooks pastiche is probably his best early film: within limits, it has unity, pace, and even a dramatic interest of sorts.",
    "It is good-natured, lowbrow, backlot, hit-or-miss humor, but with no cumulative effect beyond its succession of hard-worked jokes. More theatrical than cinematic in its conception, this group effort relies on the improvisation of its performers.",
    "By and large, a rather pitiful parody of the Universal Frankenstein movies, taking typically Brooksian liberties with characters and plot, resorting to juvenile mugging, and relying to a great extent on fairly authentic sets and photography for its better moments."

Quite funny and silly along the course of itsA goofy and silly Mel Brooks spoof on Frankenstein and gothic horror, Young Frankenstein is obviously a classic of the genre and one of those films that everybody should see at least once. Quite funny and silly along the course of its runtime, Young Frankenstein largely mirrors the plot of the original text by Mary Shelley and film by James Whale, aside from how it starts, even seguing perfectly into the original's sequel Bride of Frankenstein at the end of the film. Introducing us to Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder), a normal scientist who is ashamed of his grandfather Victor, arrives in Transylvania to bury his grandfather only to stumble onto his book of his re-animated life research and how-to guide. Reading it and falling in love with the idea, he steals a body and brain to create his Monster (Peter Boyle). With the help of hunchback Igor (Marty Feldman) and hot girl Inga (Tori Gerr), he must create his creature, keep him in the castle, and keep him from the villagers.Witty as always, gags throughout the film deliver great laughs even when they are impeccably silly or simple. With Igor's hunch constantly switching sides, it shows the attention-to-detail that Mel Brooks was always known for, while also delivering excellent laughs. Constant jokes about the Monster's lengthy member may be a bit juvenile, but somehow Brooks makes it come off. As was always the case, this pairing of Brooks and Gene Wilder was a match made in heaven with the two in perfect harmony throughout with Wilder able to deliver the script's witty lines and comical moments with great zip and timing. As with any Brooks spoof/parody film, Young Frankenstein is simply an easy watch with smart comedy that consistently delivers laughs or smirks throughout the film. Kooky, outrageous, and constantly enjoyable, Young Frankenstein simply works as a comedy spoof of gothic horror films.That said, compared to Brooks' other hits I have seen, Young Frankenstein is not nearly as funny. Not as witty as Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein is still funny, but not nearly as funny. Instead, much of it relies on the silly situations the characters find themselves in, which elicits smiles or chuckles, but never laughs. Compared to Blazing Saddles, which was littered with hysterical comedic moments, Young Frankenstein is never uproariously funny. Light, smart, and definitely funny, but Young Frankenstein is more about situational comedy instead of the witty banter form of comedy that I personally prefer. As such, the comedy in Young Frankenstein is good, but simply not my style the entire time. As a result, this one did underwhelm a bit in that regard considering my previous exposure to Brooks was so excellent and memorable.What is excellent, however, is the detail of the film, especially in the production design. Capturing the look and feeling of a gothic horror film, Young Frankenstein's set pieces were perfect for a horror film. With rotating book cases, creepy candles and looming rooms, weird contraptions, creepy photos, and even more unsettling workers in the home, every piece of this film's set and structure captures the mood the film is going for perfectly. Sinister and imaginative, these elements make this a parody/spoof of a genre that actually often works as a realization of that genre. The key highlight being Frederick and Inga searching for the mysterious music in the home. While goofy with the hidden passageways, the film nonetheless conjures up a creepy atmosphere that is filled with anticipation for what could be lurking right around the corner. Visually, the film is equally as stunning, making use of German expressionist lighting throughout. With dark shadowy corners lurking about the set piece, the film's stylish photography and lighting delivers on the atmosphere the film aims to create and further the feeling that dark, ominous occurrences are afoot in the film.",

Young Frankenstein isI am fond of Mel Brooks' films, and for me Young Frankenstein is my favourite of his and also one of my absolute favourites of the genre. It is wonderfully loopy and an ingenious send-up of universal horror clichés. Young Frankenstein is wonderfully shot in a sumptuous black and white, while the costumes, sets and make-up are wonderfully kooky. The story is fun too, while the script is hilariously quotable and Mel Brooks' direction is great. What gives Young Frankenstein real staying power is the marvellously done Puttin' on the Ritz musical number, the brain depository(outrageous to the point of being hilarious), the scene with Igor behind the book-shelves when they were looking the skulls(the facial expression and the breaking into song kills me every time), the old dad speech(then he just starts eating again), the hermit setting the monster's thumb on fire and the performances, with Gene Wilder giving one of his best performances as the infamous baron's grandson, and Peter Boyle almost stealing the show as the monster. The supporting performances are also a delight, Madeline Kahn's bride, Gene Hackman's blind hermit and Marty Feldman's hunchbacked Igor are very memorable. Overall, hysterically funny and kooky. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Also it's a slap-stick comedy, and it works on all these levels! It pokes fun at every ridiculous Gothic cliché with a very inventive and various ways that still hold up to date. But it's the editing that stands out above the rest ways. Yes the editing! I can't remember if I've seen before a film editing that works this effectively in the comedy genre. It's so subtle and creative. Gene Wilder did it again with his charismatic and charming performance that must play a vital role in making the audience riveted whatever the movie he is in.Unfortunately, there are some jokes that didn't land. Mostly because they were repetitive. Although they worked at the first time, they lost their sharpness and effectiveness very quickly, maybe even at the second time they were repeated. The rest of the jokes that didn't hit the mark, which is quite few, were just because I didn't find them funny.I think Young Frankenstein is a very funny and unique comedy, and if I may choose between the two Mel Brooks films that have been released that year, Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles, I would choose Young Frankenstein.(8/10)",
