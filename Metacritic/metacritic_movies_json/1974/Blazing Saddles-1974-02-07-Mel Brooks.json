    "summary": "The railroad's got to run through the town of Rock Ridge. How do you drive out the townfolk in order to steal their land?

Send in the toughest gang you've got...and name a new sheriff who'll last about 24 hours. But that's not really the plot of Blazing Saddles, just the pretext. Once Mel Brooks' lunatic film\u2014that many call his best\u2014gets started, logic is lost in a blizzard of gags, jokes, quips, puns, howlers, growlers and outrageous assaults upon good taste or any taste at all. Cleavon Little as the new lawman, Gene Wilder as the wacko Waco Kid, Brooks himself as a dim-witted politico and Madeline Kahn in her Marlene Dietrich send-up that earned her an Academy Award nomination all give this sagebrush saga their lunatic best. And when Blazing Saddles can't contain itself at the finale, it just proves the Old West will never be the same! [Warner Bros.]\u2026 Expand",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "It's a crazed grabbag of a movie that does everything to keep us laughing except hit us over the head with a rubber chicken. Mostly, it succeeds. It's an audience picture; it doesn't have a lot of classy polish and its structure is a total mess. But of course! What does that matter while Alex Karris is knocking a horse cold with a right cross to the jaw?",
        "Stands next to Young Frankenstein as Brooks' best movie, and, of course, boasts the god of all fart gags.",
        "No comic trope, however musty or studded with whiskers, is off limits, including bad puns, physical shtick, pie fights, goofy names and accents, song-and-dance numbers, Jewish Indians, or just having a bunch of cowpokes farting around the campfire. Some of the jokes drop like lead, but the film's anarchic spirit carries a lot of excitement, because Brooks' anything-goes philosophy means that no comedic possibilities go unconsidered.",
        "Brooks' fast-paced direction is a masterpiece of comedy detail, filled with delightful and perfectly timed sight gags.",
        "Brooks\u2019 early reputation as a film director rests with the success of this raunchy Western spoof. A great cast is eclipsed by the hilarious performances of Korman and Kahn, who plays a Marlene Dietrich-like chanteuse.",
        "Like its many raucous predecessors, Blazing Saddles is a thing of bits and bits\u2014some good, some awful\u2014pinned to a story line that sags like a tenement clothesline. The movie tends to improve in the retelling, as memory edits out ineptitudes, the better to dwell on moments of glory... But goldarned if it doesn't work. Goldarned if the whole fool enterprise is not worth the attention of any moviegoer with a penchant for what one actor, commenting on another's Gabby Hayes imitation, calls \"authentic western gibberish.\"",
        "One of the funniest awful movies ever made.",
        "Much of the laughter Mr. Brooks inspires is hopeful, before-the-gag laughter, which can be terribly tiring...Blazing Saddles has no dominant personality, and it looks as if it includes every gag thought up in every story conference. Whether good, bad, or mild, nothing was thrown out.",
        "What really lessens SADDLES is that its intentions aren't clear. Its humor provoked no thinking; insensitive moviegoers assumed the racial put-downs and cowboy crudeness were deliberate. The public loved the film--it stands as the highest grossing western in history--$45 million plus! But they loved it for all the wrong reasons.",
        "A limp, shapeless mess of a film trades in a genuine respect for westerns\u2019 tropes for purile vulgarity and joy-buzzer showmanship.",
        "'Oh Lord', says the preacher in a suitably grave voice, 'do we have the strength to carry out this task in one night, or are we just jerking off?' Maybe Mel Brooks should have asked himself that question about this movie."

It is silly and it is not subtle at all, there are those who will flinch at some of the language used. But it is very funny, and works really well as a spoof. The story is a lot of fun, and there are enough slapstick and jokes to amuse as well as a wonderful script. The production values are very good too, while the acting is spot on. Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder are both great as the smart-as-a-whip railway worker appointed first black sheriff and the drunken gunman who helps him out, while Madeline Kahn(in a Marlene Dietrich send-up), Alex Karras and Harvey Korman are even better. Overall, not subtle but still great. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

I haven't seen too many Western comedy films, other than 'A Million Ways to Die in the West' and this was definitely funnier (in my opinion) - there's a strong sense of quirkiness. Its certainly not a film that takes itself too seriously - its more of a spoof/parody film but I enjoyed that. This is a bit of a cult classic and I can understand why.  The cast performances are good too. This is a politically incorrect film, featuring multiple racial slurs, so it won't appeal to all but as parodies go, this is one of the better ones. Yes, I would certainly recommend this, for the surreal situations depicted and the madcap zany charatcers, if nothing else. It also has a bit of a comic book feel to it as well.",
