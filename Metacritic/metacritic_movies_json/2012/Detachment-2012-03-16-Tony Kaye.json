    "critic_reviews": [
        "Nobody's idea of \"Mr. Holland's Opus,\" but it winds up in a similar place, more or less.",
        "Adrien Brody deserves superlatives for his acting in the alternately mesmerizing and maddening Detachment.",
        "When it stays in the classroom, Detachment is a scrappy testament - to the futility of even trying to reach students who are cut off from the possibilities of knowledge, and to the way that our teachers are slowly being driven nuts.",
        "A movie you keep expecting to fizzle because of its punching-the-air gracelessness, but there's something weirdly effective about the artistic desperation, which includes inserts of chalkboard animation and to-the-camera testimonials.",
        "Adrien Brody, delivering his finest performance since \"The Pianist,\" plays the central role of the disaffected Henry Barthes.",
        "People will either love Detachment or hate it, and either way it provides powerful testimony to the unrivaled passion and undiminished craft of director Kaye, whose notoriety in the film industry is matched by his near-total invisibility to the general public.",
        "For all its untrammeled excesses - and Kaye has proved that he'd sooner torpedo his own career than accept a little constructive trammeling - Detachment is almost forcibly moving, body-slamming its audience into submission.",
        "Ultimately, Detachment invites us to feel precisely what it warns against \u2013 detached.",
        "The shriller its didacticism, the more unhinged it becomes. But even at its most ludicrous - when it is shouting into your ear - its sheer audacity grabs your attention.",
        "Comes across like the creation of a precocious student. I don't mean that to be a damning critique, though Detachment is a mesmerizing misfire -- it's just that it has the uncomplicated earnestness and hyperbolic melodrama of teenage poetry.",
        "It's nice to see righteous anger in a movie. If only the education drama Detachment knew what to do with it.",
        "The movie is one big scream, clich\u00e9d and hardly credible as an oblique call to civility.",
        "Scripter Lund, himself an ex-teacher, delivers a story that lacks nuance, and mixes badly with Kaye's impatient edits, Dutch angles and extreme close-ups.",
        "[Director Kaye's] dedication to the material is admirable, but his tactic of following one dismal development with an even more depressing one comes to seem monotonous and pointless.",
        "I didn't believe a word of the film and found myself feeling nothing but (I'm sure this wasn't Kaye's point) detachment.",
        "Movies about teachers are flypaper for overblown armchair crusaderism, and this overbearingly cynical attempt gets my vote for worst offender yet.",
        "The movie has an undeniable visceral power. It is also a loud, grating wallow in dime-store despair, a cheap and hollow button-puncher.",
        "Detachment drives a coffin nail through a noble profession with such ruthless virulence that it makes no point at all.",
        "Endng in risible bathos, Tony Kaye's urban high school melodrama is all about the cute teacher's crises and the girls who love him."

Sometimes, I'm Meredith, who is mixed up and need someone to be a permanent solution for her. somebody, after watching,  maybe say that this is not a film. it is an exaggeration! This existentialist world does not belong to this world, especially American world. Well, I said this is Tony Kaye talkie. This is a dream world  in his mind who thinks a better world among this corrupted real world. Who said that you must think all the characters are real and they are beside us? No, They our other moral parts!\rDetachment is not a lesson from a director. No, It just wants to show that you will be this if you want to be this.",

Its perhaps a little like Dangerous Minds, only not so dramatic as such. Having been in education for many years, seeing how disinterested the numerous students were reminded me of situations I've seen myself. I liked that at times we (the viewer) are shown what appear to be drawings made out of chalk shown on old fashioned blackboards, drawings/images of birds taking flight, animals and so on. I suppose its to represent freedom and mobility (social mobility) perhaps.I thought that Adrien Brody did well portraying the substitute teacher, someone who can guess what may be behind some of his temporary pupils problems and issues but never having the time to be able to fully work with any of them, while we also see that he has his own emotional stresses in his own family life.This is a sad watch but its a good film. I liked the variety of characters present and I thought the film was well casted too, so overall I would recommend this film, yes.",
