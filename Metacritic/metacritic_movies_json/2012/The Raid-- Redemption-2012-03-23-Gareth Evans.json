The building has never been raided before, never been touched by police. Seen as a no go zone it has since become a sanctuary to killers, gangs, rapists and thieves seeking accommodation in the one place they know they cannot be touched. Making their move in the break of dawn the swat team work their way up the building under cover of silence.  But when a chance encounter with a spotter blows their cover and with news of their assault traveling to Tama in his penthouse suite the building is locked down with all lights out and all exits blocked.  Stranded on the 6th floor the swat team must fight their way through every floor and every room not just to complete their mission but to survive. (Merantau Films)\u2026 Expand",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Remember your first time with Hard Boiled? Die Hard? This is how it's done - a clean, hard, constant hit of adrenalin. If it's not the best action movie of the year, we'll eat a fridge.",
        "Once the action starts - and it starts very quickly - The Raid is relentless, breathtaking in its sheer propulsive majesty. But it's also shot through with moments of bleak poetry amid the carnage.",
        "There are moments when The Raid: Redemption doesn't feel like an action movie so much as pure action itself, delivered in strong, undiluted doses and with the sort of creative one-upmanship capable of rejuvenating a stale, seen-it-all genre.",
        "This is the sort of film for which the phrase 'movie-movie' was coined -- and coined as a term of highest praise.",
        "Extraordinary stunt and fight work and nonstop excitement, but a warning to those who are at all squeamish: this may be the most violent movie I've ever seen.",
        "American action movies are almost entirely defined by cutaways, blaring music cues and grunts. The Raid: Redemption, a hyper-energetic Indonesian martial arts movie, delivers an effective rebuke to that meek norm. Bones break, blood flows and swift, excessively complicated fight choreography puts virtually everything released in North America since \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" to instant shame.",
        "It's exhausting, exhilarating, riveting stuff that fans of high-octane filmmaking should not miss.",
        "It offers some of the best Asian martial-arts choreography of recent years and an electric, claustrophobic puzzle-palace atmosphere that'll leave you wrung out and buzzed.",
        "Poised at the midway point between an ultraviolent video game and a neo-classic dance musical. As midnight-movie mash-ups go, it's pretty amazing.",
        "Unapologetically brutal and unencumbered by much plot, Raid is the year's most turbo-charged film.",
        "Remember that ultra-violent scene in \"Old Boy\" when the dude plowed through a subway platform of bad guys and was the only one left standing? Multiply it by four or five and that's The Raid: Redemption.",
        "Gareth Evans' Indonesian martial-arts throwback The Raid: Redemption has a look and feel that resembles the best of '80s cult action movies: half John Carpenter, half John Woo.",
        "An orgiastic barrage of violence, The Raid: Redemption is, at least in its finest moments, one of the most breathless, blistering action movies in recent memory.",
        "Arguably the most dynamic Asian action film since the 1990s peaks of John Woo and Tsui Hark, The Raid: Redemption works as sheer gladiatorial ballet.",
        "Lean, fast-moving, and filled with game-changing fight sequences that have a brutally beautiful (or beautifully brutal) quality, Gareth Evans's Indonesian martial-arts film The Raid: Redemption lives up to its viral hype.",
        "Taking the genre to a higher level of intensity, the Welsh-born Evans continues what he started in previous Indonesia-set actioner \"Merantau,\" but this picture will seal his cult status.",
        "When it comes to The Raid: Redemption, there are no pretentions. Pure and simple, this is about violence. As we used to say, \"kickin' ass and takin' names.\"",
        "Plot, characterization and dialogue are merely the frame here for the real goods, an immersion into the Indonesian martial arts form known as silat.",
        "The action is brutal, bloody and virtually nonstop in this adrenaline-packed riff on \"Assault on Precinct 13.''",
        "Iko Uwais is not exactly a household name, but the Indonesian heartthrob appears to be well on his way with The Raid: Redemption, a clever, action-packed film that showcases his movie-star looks, low-key charisma and breathtaking martial arts skills.",
        "There's a sliver of a plot to The Raid, but it's really not worth going over -- when the characters pause to talk, which is rare, it does tend to kill the film's momentum.",
        "If you like martial-arts films, it's well worth your while, a non-stop orgy of brilliantly choreographed fight scenes. Eventually it's all too much, a blur of fists, blades and snapped bones that run together. Still, it's a wild ride.",
        "I do wish that Evans were a better storyteller. When he isn't turning mad-dog violence into visual rock & roll, The Raid shreds narrative coherence to ribbons.",
        "Built on shaky and blood-soaked ground, but if towering technique is all you want from an action movie, then yippee-ki-yay.",
        "The Raid is maniacal in its pacing and assault tactics. It's also, absurdly, rated R. Fantastic. I love that a film this gory secured the same Motion Picture Association of America rating as \"The King's Speech.\"",
        "This mostly no-nonsense, floor-by-floor ass-kicking panorama is admirably humble.",
        "This is a movie to be experienced on a more visceral level. As long as you don't expect anything more, you won't be disappointed.",
        "The special effects here are wiry martial artists grunting their way through fight after fight. It's exhausting but exhilarating.",
        "The Raid: Redemption definitely delivers everything that international action fans want. The question I have is whether the laws of supply and demand are adequate tools for evaluating a movie's worth.",
        "The mousetrap setup and tight fight spaces, the bad blood and cruel deaths - soon makes the movie grindingly monotonous, a blur of thudding body blows.",
        "This film is about violence. All violence. Wall-to-wall violence. Against many of those walls, heads are pounded again and again into a pulpy mass. If I estimated the film has 10 minutes of dialogue, that would be generous."

The Raid is a masterpiece, no doubt about it. It's pure adrenaline. It's strong, brutal, violent, intense, entertaining. No Hollywood action movie can compare to this. There are massive shooting, fights with bare hands, with knives, with machetes, broken bones, falling bodies. The choreography of the fighting is just perfect. The amount of work that the director, Gareth Evans, puts into the making of this film is simply amazing: every scene was designed perfectly. He doesn't want to just filming some combat but he gives a sense to everything that happens, and the few connecting scenes are treated as good as the action scenes. The plot is indeed at minimum but coherent. The Indonesian stunts are incredible. It stars two of the most talented athletes and  martial arts fighter out there: Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian. The soundtrack matchs perfectly with the action. This is new classical action movies. It's a watershed, there is a \"before The Raid\" and an \"after The Raid\". Since the release of the film, Hollywood has tried to adapt and has produced movie inspired by the cinematography and the style of The Raid with some good and some bad results, but there is nothing like this. Simply a masterpiece. 10/10.",

It's a frenetic, gritty, brutal, stylish action flick that grabs you from the first minute and doesn't let up till the final frame. Although the plot is about a SWAT team storming a slum apartment block to arrest a gangland boss, it's peppered with Indonesian silat martial art scenes that are breathtaking for their speed, style and creativity -- as well as their brutality. They're some of the most bruising and high-octane punch-ups ever filmed, performed with amazing flair by a host of Indonesian martial artists, including Iko Uwais, the telegenic lead and Yayan Ruhian, the oh-so-evil \"Mad Dog\", who at times exudes an almost demonic, monster-like quality. The camera is kept so close to the action that you feel you're in the thick of the action at all times and the film never lets you off the hook. It's very violent but I don't think it glamorizes violence in the same way as many films of this genre do. The heroes suffer. They would rather not be there. They don't make jokes after killing people -- killing is not fun but a necessary evil.The gangland boss, played Ray Sahetapy, is also worthy of a special mention. He's not your stereotypical baddy, but an aloof, menacing, strangely quiet villain who's devoid of empathy and capable of the most awful atrocity at any moment. Truly scary, and truly new in an Indonesian movie.This is a truly world-class movie and by far the best Indonesian action film I have ever seen. It truly deserves its high score on Metacritic, and is a must-see for all action buffs.",

Never before has human brutality looked so beautiful, presented in a way which would resemble an intricate dance if it weren't for the copious blood and bone-snapping. It's a joy to see a relatively unknown martial art being practiced on the big screen, and the Indonesian Pencak Silat allows for the choreographing of action unlike any you've ever seen before. The plot, which involves a SWAT team fighting their way through an apartment block controlled by a malicious drug lord flies along, and the film is tense, gritty and pulse-pounding throughout. Iko Uwais plays Rama, the film's primary protagonist, who is a young new addition to the SWAT team, and his almost supernatural skill with Silat is in unquestionable as Rama is forced to undertake the majority of the film's fights against hordes of drug cartel henchmen single-handedly. Uwais is far more than a blunt instrument however, and in the long tradition of strong silent types with a good heart throughout film history, it is established early on in the film that Rama is only committing the acts of brutality he does to provide a safe and financially secure life for his wife and soon-to-be-born child. The drug lord Tama (Ray Sahetapy) is also shown to be the most diabolical of evil-doers, a representation of everything wrong with contemporary Indonesia, and thoroughly deserving of everything that comes to him. Uwais, along with Yayan Ruhian, who plays the terrifying and volatile bodyguard Mad Dog choreographed the film and made the numerous action sequences so explosive and memorable. Though the film in a sense de-sensitises you to violence, such is the extent and frequency of it on screen, you are brought crashing back down to reality by Writer/Director Gareth Evans' human characters and subtextual comments on social problems prevalent in modern Indonesia (poverty, the break-down of family units and the dominance of the illegal drugs trade are all referenced within the film's narrative). Evans is not just incredibly talented as an action director, guiding cinematographer Matt Flannery's stylish camera work, and undertaking the striking, expert film editing himself, but he's also an effective and intelligent, though minimalistic screenwriter, and as a passionate promoter of Indonesian culture, which he clearly has a great love of. He's certainly a real talent to watch, and I am incredibly excited to see how else he can elevate the action genre, and perhaps other areas of cinema in the future.",

Countless criminalsThe Raid: Redemption provides its audience with numerous exciting action scenes, but very little else. The movie focuses on an Indonesian special ops team's raid -- and presumed redemption -- of a crime lord's building. Countless criminals live in the rooms and roam the halls. Some pack knives, others carry guns, and one enjoys using his fists and feet. Who says you can't stay fit? Needless to say they're none too happy when spec ops invades, prompting one of the various shoot outs. These sequences are very well done from a technological standpoint, boasting simply stunning stunt work. However, not a single character comes to life as a human being. In this movie people exist primarily to be beaten, shot, and/or stabbed. In fact, many rush forward to do so. One fight scene features around twenty criminals rushing the protagonist, who easily disables or kills each and every one of them. This -- other than his pregnant wife -- is how you can tell he is the protagonist. At no point do any of the criminals look around and say, \"Hey, guys, this isn't working like we planned. Do you think maybe we should try something else?\" What little plot there is seems to have been lifted from bits and scenes of better action flicks with less impressive action sequences. Still the stunts and technology deserve praise. The Raid: Redemption will appeal to a good number genre fans, but those expecting more than dazzling fights and shoot outs may find themselves oddly disappointed.",

With that said, it is not a perfect film. The story is that of Rama, a rookie police officer who with another 20 or so police officers is taking part in a Raid (to my complete shock) of an apartment building being run by a notorious drug lord. However Rawa has another reason for wanting into that building, something revealed later in the film in one of the films few moments of levity and actual conversation. The film, to almost every male viewers joy, is almost wall to wall violence. It's manic, its fast paced, its incredibly inventive and it takes up almost all of the film. The few moments were there is actual talking it is to progress to the next fight, the next set piece meaning there is little place for emotion of character in the film. It might make me sound greedy but a little more story and dialogue was needed as by the end of the movie I was visually impressed but emotionally anaesthetised. There is no doubt the director is talented and put a considerable amount of passion into the way he presented the movie as the direction is unexpected and at times shocking (but in a good way). He made the film he wanted to make and with very little to spend on it and that is commendable, especially considering the levels of destruction the film brings, but all in all its an action film with no soul, no one to root for as its just two groups of people massacring each other in an old building.",

In a time of CG, 3D and artificial action sequences, The Raid stands tall as one of the greatest action movies in years, the only things that have the intensity and pure raw violence are Ong Bak and Chocolate from Thailand. The story certainly could've been more polished, but it's undeniably relentlessly gripping from the first thrown punch.The Raid is about a police squad that storm into an apartment, which doubles as a nest of criminals / martial artists, in order to apprehend a drug lord. They'll soon find that these thugs are very well trained despite their cryptic outfits. The hoodlums come down pouring in dozens, launching punches, kicks and bullets their way, generally making their lives harder. In a short moment, the raid turns into a struggle for survival. Iko Uwais plays Rama, one of a rookie cop who's trapped in the building, deliver the best visceral combat scenes I've ever seen in Indonesian cinema.Highly fast paced and devastating, it's not your usual near-miss exaggerated camera angle shots a la your average action movies, neither it's flying stylish acrobatic wire fu of Hong Kong, The Raid is a beast on its own right. The director, Gareth Evans, cleverly uses pencak silat, an Indonesia traditional martial art, mixes it with many aspects of MMA and also plenty usage of sharp weapons or even handguns. Every movement is designed to hurt, immensely and veraciously, you won't find flashy dashing choreography here.Expect plenty faces hammered into the wall, knives introduced to throats and even point blank headshot. All in its uncensored bloodstained glory. The amount and quality of the fights are ridiculously excessive, world class even. This will shock many international audiences, as it already has. Scenes are masterfully done, giving clean shots to dramatic moments, even those without someone getting pummeled. The director has a sense of focus which gives clarity in midst of high octane scenes.However it's not without its flaws. Some plot holes remain unchecked as the characters' motivations are a bit vague, maybe for the sequel, I'm not sure. The dialogues can be gritty as I viewed it on my native language, but it can also be a double edge sword. At some points, it becomes unintentionally funny because the delivery of Malay accent is over-the-top. I do hope it won\u00e2",

Goes with the ideology of \"If i swear a lot people will think it's realistic and thus good writing\" at nosium. The directing is pretty bad. The camera bobs around incessantly for seemingly no reason during non action sequences. The writing is downright atrocious. Most characters just exist to be disposable meat sacks to add up pointless bodycount and even the main character seems to be devoid of any development. It shows some moments of promise like the propane tank in the fridge but it's not worth siting through the stupid moments like the part where the entire team lost their firearms for seemingly no reason other than to showcase some of the mediocre kung fu fights, or the part where a character was about to explain why they can't call for backup but stops as if he just realized their really is no reason why they can't. Oh and there's the part where an unarmed character walks past a gun and two tonfas, without picking them up for absolutely no reason, and don't even get me started on the part where a villain who has a guy at gun point drops the gun and gives the cliche \"I don't like using guns. I like fist fighting because it provides the audience with an actual action scene-I MEAN I PREFER KILLING WITH MY FISTS OR SOMETHING YEAH THAT'S IT!\"",

It's screenplay is so deprived of character, plot, emotion, and logic that it becomes pointless.  The basic premise of a raid on a labyrinth building full of gangsters could have been made into a crazy, scary, and tension filled ride, but the apartment complex looks almost exactly the same on every floor, and the main character has about as much vulnerability as the hulk.  It works fine as a showcase for some incredibly kinetic martial arts showdowns... for a while.  It just becomes so repetitive and sadistically gory that by the end you feel like it was more of a pro wrestling special (if you think they're real you need help)  than an actual movie.  Every cop is somehow a master at hand to hand combat, and no one wants to pick up any of the machine guns lying around because,  squeezing a trigger, that's like ordering take-out.\"  It throws logic out the window purposefully, because otherwise there couldn't be non-stop fighting.  I must admit that it's all choreographed amazingly, and can be very exciting at times, but in the end it just feels kinda... stupid.

The set up is similar to the Dredd movie.

I have to say though with the level of action and brutality this makes Dredd look tame. This makes most action movies look tame. The best part is that it manages to do so without seeming overly gruesome and has a great plot.\r The characters are fantastic and there are enough twists to keep you interested, so you can see that there was thought put into the story and it payed off. Surprisingly enough some of the most tense moments happen when the fists aren't flying. Tense stand offs and moments of cat and mouse will keep you on the edge of your seat in anticipation.

It's certainly of interest if you're interested in relentless bone-jarring violence. Plot is paper thin; an elite swat invade a building to takte out a crime boss. The elite squad all get massacred almost immediately, apart from the protagonist and a few comrades. There's a huge gunfight at the beginning, but they obviously used up all the bullets in Indonesia as beyond that they resort to bladed weapons and bare fists. The protagonist beats up hundreds of low level henchmen on his own. Of course this being a martial arts film they all patiently wait in line to attack him one at a time. There are some boss battles on the way before we arrive at the bloody finale. The plot is very reminiscent of a video game and the violence is relentless and gratuitous. It's ok if you're into choreographed fight sequences, but I prefer something like Die Hard which has characters, a story and a little humour, in addition to all the violence. This movie is just wall to wall fighting.",

The SWAT team goes floor by floor securingThe Raid is about a 20-man SWAT team task with raiding a 30-story building of a notorious drug kingpin, who is hides the city's most dangerous criminals from cops and makes a hefty living out of it. The SWAT team goes floor by floor securing the building and neutralizing threats, when suddenly on the 6th floor, they get spotted and all hell breaks loose. Simple ain't it ? well that's the beauty of The Raid, at least the first one, it takes what is a very simple premise and engages the viewer with the team, feeling their despair and fright, making them easy to root for and constantly afraid of their safety as the film proves very soon that they're very, VERY expendable. Same goes for our leading man played by the Martial Arts maestro of Indonesia, Iko Uwais, whose introduction of himself, and his family, gives us just enough to know that it's him we will be following through the story but not enough to make us COMPLETELY assured that he will survive, Uwais just sort of carries this John McClane type of charisma with him, you root for the guy without having knowing much about his background(and in all honesty it's better off that way) yet as you imagine yourself in this situation you feel like Rama in a lot of ways, same goes for the rest of the team, from the fierce and loyal Jaka(Joe taslim), to the mysterious and harsh Lieutenant Wahyu, the vaillains are great too, the left and right hand men of the brutal, yet cunning Tama are a perfect balance between a silent fighter and a careful schemer. Each and every character has more personality and depth than you'd expect out of a film with this particular premise and this particular genre.The action sequences are legendary to this day and will probably serve as bright and energizing examples of how to do, intricate, intense martial arts/action choreography and film it in the most coherent and exhilarating ways possible for many generations to come. Writer/director/editor Gareth Evans has a keen eye for long-takes and brisk editing, combine that with the relentless pace of the film, and you get a non-stop action thrill ride that quite literally BEATS THE **** out of most modern Hollywood blockbusters of this caliber. These are people who have passion and skill to make the action as hard-hitting and natural as possible, and the choreography by the cast members including Uwais and Yayan Ruhian, who plays the vicious and nearly unkillable Mad Dog in the film, is nothing short of consistently inventive and remarkable. The fights are greatly varied too, from the first and only shootout, to machete fights with necks being slammed on the broken door lintels, to single take jumps from A **** WINDOW, and of course the classic Hong Kong action movie style one on one and even two on one showdowns. The most underrated and overlooked aspect of the film, is actually the fact that in some ways it's a horror film as well, a horror-survival martial arts action films is what Wikipedia says and is very true. There's constant tension and fear of detection and discovery as the gang not only outnumbers but outmatches the rapidly dying team. The score by Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda, Joe Trapenese and Fajar Yuskemal is superb, perfectly combining, electronic beats with the more rock'n'roll side of the aforementioned band, to create a compelling and visceral score for the fight scenes. All these elements come together to deliver a blistering experience, full of blood, slashed necks and more than enough broken bones.The Raid is a kinetic, exciting and uncompromising Martial arts action film, that makes you care for performers and love their performance, both emotional and physical. The only reason I'm not giving this a 10, is because I think that the sequel is EVEN BETTER and that if a question was ever put of me deciding to eliminate one Raid film forever, it would definitely be the first.",

It is mindless and straight forward but did a good job making you feel trapped and it was fun rooting for the brothers and the fight scenes were good though absurd. But if you are looking for a masterpiece you will be sorely disappointed. This is not original in any way and there is little story to really sink your mind into it. It is basically a copy/paste of any Die Hard film but with a more serious tone and no comedy unless you consider the fight scenes funny (which I did). Judge Dredd was almost exactly the same as well. For the most part, it is just like any mindless action flick. Watch it for what it is, and keep your enthusiasm in check. The ratings are inflated on this one probably because of younger viewers.",

A SWAT team with 20 members is on a raid to capture the legendaryAn intense and well choreographed action movie that is strong from start to finish. Also pretty brutal and a no nonsense approach. The set up is excellent and wasted no time. A SWAT team with 20 members is on a raid to capture the legendary crime lord Tama who is feared, worshiped and ruthless. He lives in an apartment block guarded with his loyal men and rented rooms for others under his protection. The plan is not to go in guns blazing as it is to risky and will surly backfire. They will silently go in to capture room for room from floor to floor. The further they get without being detected the better their chances get. For the new officer Rama it is his first mayor assignment. Here I stop to avoid spoilers. For the story I am impressed as they do more than needed for an action movie and everything works well. All twists are fully believable, enhance the story  and in combination with the fitting characters we get a really enjoyable experience. I have to praise the whole cast. Lets start wit the main actor Iko Uwais as Rama. He is a great protagonist and his struggles make him even more believable aka better. He easily won me over and I want to see more from him. Ray Sahetapy as Tama is frightening good. His introduction scene alone I would use in film school on how to set up a bad guy. It dropped our jars and made him as menacing as scary. Yayan Ruhian as Mad Dog is also one of my favorites. He is always shorter and smaller than his enemies and this could be a miss in other movies. But by god he is a menacing fighter you have to take 100% serious. You never want to get on his bad side. An amazing performance and I want to see more. The rest also deliver. Donny Alamsyah as Andi is more than it seems and works great. Joe Taslim as Jake the leader of the SWAT nails his role and each scene with him is a stregth. Special praise to I think Alfredius Godfred as the machete wielding criminal. His eyes and gaze alone deliver more than others do with words. He is so scary. I see no flaws in the cast and say this is a masterpiece in this regard. I must mention the well choreographed martial arts and action scenes. I only discovered this movie through praise from a YouTube channel which ranked it in the top well choreographed modern martial arts movies. It is fully deserved as the fights are intense, awesome to watch and the poster child for the phrase \u201cYou can feel the impact\u201d. A must see for me. Of cause I must also mention that it is brutal and often we gasped during the movie. The sets of the building fully give the derelict feeling and round up the experience. All in all this was a pleasant surprise and I give a 10/10 because it hits all the right spots for action, characters, martial arts and gives a satisfying ending.",

If I estimated the'The Raid: Redemption'' is an indonesian made martial arts/action thriller that is all about violence. All violence. Wall-to-wall violence. Against many of those walls, heads are pounded again and again into a pulpy mass. If I estimated the film has 15 minutes of dialogue, i think i would be generous.\rBut then again, what does my opinion matter, it is highly rated on every movie critic site on the planet and it is hailed as a breakthrough for martial arts.\rI dont mind violence at all, nor do i mind a movie that tells its story visually, but the director (Gareth Evans) doesnt take the effort to make it a well-made film, it's basically 100 minutes of non stop action, with no plot, no characters, barely any dialogue, and just constant hard-driving, butt-kicking, pulse-pounding, bone-crunching, skull-smashing, bloodcurdling and largely a hand-to-hand, fist-to-face, foot-to-groin battle, with a few machetes and guns tossed in for good measure. Which is a formula Evans clearly knows is a large audience for, hence the obviously high ratings, and movies like this just dont entertain me at all. It's basically you watching a well-made realistic martial arts mission-type video game.\r Detailed criticism: Why does the movie establishes that the ''lead role'' is a muslim in the beginning of the film? They do nothing at all with it after the opening scene. It seems pointless, except as a cheap, failed attempt in some sort of character development. But it is pointless to even attempt at something like that, no one in the film has a personality, they are all relentless fighters with no brain in their heads.\rAnother cheap plot point that was extremely predictable: one of the gangsters that is helping the drug lord that is camping out in this massive squat, is Rama's brother (The ''leading man''). Thus it is ofcourse inevitable that they eventually will hold each other's lives in their hands and resolve deep childhood feelings to their satisfaction at the end of the film, and that they obviously both survive and go their ways in the end...\rLike i said, ''The Raid: Redemption'' is basically a well-made video game: a ruthless fighter stands in a corridor and destroys an enemy. As the enemy falls, another jumps into position from around corner, ready to be destroyed in turn. Then another, and another. It's like they're being ejected by an automatic victim dispenser.\rAnother small detail: What the hell does \"Redemption\" mean in the title? Who, or what, is redeemed, and how? If you kill lots of people and are still alive, have you been redeemed? If you and your brother don't kill each other after almost everyone else does, is that redemption? Or is \"redemption\" just one of those title words like \"reloaded\" or \"destiny\" to help people tell movies apart? Seems a bit stupid in my humble opinion, but i think i read somewhere that Gareth Evans is making the third installment of the Raid trilogy (yay) and he said that the 3rd film will take place before the first ''Raid'', so probably something will happen in that film that needs redeeming..\r Another thing, this movie is inconsistent and unrealistic as hell, not just because something ridiculous like this would NEVER happen, but also because most people they ''kill'' go down by just getting kicked in the stomach, or getting slammed into a wall, or getting dropped on a table, and then there is a final fight with ''Mad Dog'' where he continues to fight for at least 5 minutes whilst having a fluorecent tube stuck in his neck, and before that he's been kicked and punched to absolute pulp. But he just continues to fight.\rIt's inconsistent as hell\r The only reason i gave it a 2/5 instead of giving it lower, is simply because, i can't deny that the stunts and fight choreography isnt fantastic, and the way they killed (some) people was quite creative.\r All in all, movies like this simply dont entertain me, no depth, no story, no characters and just constant neck-breaking action, but that's what it's meant to be. Something like this just doesnt quite suit me.\rCan't dare expect the redemption from the sequel for what I found lacking here. Yet I guess I'll give it a go. (yay)\r\"The Raid: Redemption\" will be most successful for people with A.D.D. or just generally short attention spans, but then again, that's what it's aimed at.",
