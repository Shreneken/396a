She travels to the Centrino Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Italy where her mother has been locked away to determine if her mother is mentally ill or demonically possessed. When she recruits two young exorcists to cure her mom using unconventional methods combining both science and religion, they come face-to-face with pure evil in the form of four powerful demons possessing Maria. Many have been possessed by one; only one has been possessed by many. (Paramount Pictures)\r… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "While this religio-horror effort does contain some nice scares, and a memorably unnerving turn from Crowley, The Devil Inside's biggest shock arrives when it abruptly ends - just as it hits its stride. The result is a found-footage movie whose third act remains missing.",
    "All hell breaks loose and it's a heck of a lot of fun to watch.",
    "Despite the palpable air of deja vu that hangs over it like a light fog, The Devil Inside generates a fair amount of suspense during sizable swaths of its familiar but serviceable exorcism-centric scenario.",
    "Even with The Exorcist in the world, there is still scope for a contemporary, shocking and thrilling film to be made on the subject of possession. But this is not it: some found footage should really just stay lost.",
    "Whatever possessed Bell & Co. to turn a slow-burning creepfest into a frenzied freak show of multiple exorcisms (including one in a moving car), the devil only knows.",
    "The reality of The Devil Inside is that it's a half-hearted patchwork of ideas blatantly lifted from better films, with characters who have to act increasingly foolish in order to allow the action to go forward and an ending so anticlimactic and abrupt that the audience at the screening I attended erupted in enraged boos as the credits rolled.",
    "The mother/daughter drama should have played a bigger part in this film as the 87-minute runtime passes quickly and leaves us feeling utterly short-changed.",
    "The film's contradictory and nullifying dilemma of wanting to be both scripted and vérité at once, a plight that affects so much contemporary TV, is temporarily quelled in heated scenes of curse-laden levitation and Linda Blair contortion, which dutifully deliver the scares.",
    "Almost competent but not quite watchable.",
    "It has been a long time since I've heard people - many people - distinctly yell, \"Boo!\" Usually they just growl or moan or hiss. They don't bother actually to articulate the word \"Boo!\" I second their statement. The ending reeks.",
    "Never gets off the ground, trotting out the same predictable twisting heads and psycho-babble without a whiff of originality or discernible visual flair. As a result, the would-be thriller proves as scary and unsettling as a slab of devil's food cake - only considerably less satisfying.",
    "It's a pestilence of infectious claptrap.",
    "The Devil Inside joins a long, woozy-camera parade of found-footage scare pictures, among them \"The Blair Witch Project,\" the \"Paranormal Activity\" films and certain wedding videos that won't go away.",
    "The Devil Inside plays like a horror film conceived on graph paper.",
    "The scariest thing about The Devil Inside is that a major studio like Paramount Pictures, which is distributing it, may be able to squeeze more profit out of a tedious, tediously exhausted subgenre that was already creatively tapped out when \"The Blair Witch Project\" spooked audiences more than a decade ago.",
    "The Devil Inside manages not only to scrape the barrel's bottom but to drill a hole in said bottom and funnel deeper into the scum.",
    "The Devil Inside offers proof, if any were needed, that demons run rampant in Hollywood, possessing otherwise intelligent and creative people to make absolutely shitty \"gotcha!\" mockumonstrosities like this one.",
    "No one onscreen was actor enough to make us believe we were watching actual people commit or require actual exorcisms.",
    "The hilariously convoluted thriller contains all the elements for a wacky parody of exorcism movies, except a sense of humor about itself: The Devil Inside never acknowledges its innate ridiculousness, so the laughs are unintentional."

Besides the fact that you're hard pressed to find a good horror movie nowadays, I also can tell that the same format of \"found footage\" and adding info about the Vatican not condoning filming in the church has been done to death ever since the hit of Paranormal Activity - which I find to be great. However, the trailer of 'The Devil Inside' was definitely creepy so I was hoping for an entire movie of scares while setting aside the predicted corniness and thin story line. With this movie, though, if you've seen the trailer then you've seen the only exciting and scary parts in the whole thing. Seriously. Because of its documentary-style format there was a lot of downtime between exorcist scenes and so the viewer hopes for some scares after watching people you don't like doing Jersey Shore style confessionals that are ultimately cheesy and, frankly, hilarious. I'm a huge movie buff in general so I don't mind downtime in movies and I don't have to be entertained the entire time to keep my attention. But 'The Devil Inside' rarely kept my attention as I found myself mouthing the words I had heard over and over in the trailers. Then there's the ending. I understand their reasoning for having it end abruptly because it's an attempt to convince the viewers that they never got to finish the \"documentary\" because other circumstances got in the way. That being said, it was too abrupt as I was expecting some big finale that they seemed to be working up to that might've saved it a little more. But nothing really came in and saved the movie. Not even the turn of events that happen to the main four characters towards the end could save it. The reason that I gave it a four as opposed to a one or two was because had I not seen the trailers then I would've found it scary. So my advice would be to skip the theatre and wait to rent it when it comes out on DVD. Watch it with someone unfamiliar with the movie and see their reactions - cause thanks to the extended advertising the movie ends up being a waste of time.",

For the first half an hour it did not happen anything (and for a short film that is serious), then when it began the second half with the possessed did not do anything to fear. And then when the actors were very woody, especially in fake documentaries, must be good and make you partaker of their emotions. The only actress that I think you save is one that has played Maria Rossi. Then the ending was the worst blow of all! I never expected such a thing. This meant that they had more ideas towards the end and this thing has angered me and many of those who were in the room. The film, as I said before, it lasted an hour and a quarter and the second one could put scenes that spoke of the main characters or even a few scenes that made fear or anxiety ... time there.",

Unfortunately, this movie was just BAD. \"The Devil Inside\" was nothing short of a boring, fake documentary about demonic possession with little to no thrills or scares. It's pretty sad when the scariest part of a \"horror\" movie is a dog barking (literally the only time I jumped during the whole film). This piece of plagiarized garbage attempts to cloak itself as a documentary, but really falls short and delivers its audience less of a supernatural thriller and more of \"priests\" and \"professionals\" vaguely speaking about the topic. The first possession scene doesn't even happen until more than halfway through the movie, and it is lackluster at best. Complete with contortionist-like movements, absurd cursing, and speaking in demonic tongues, this movie's possession scenes aren't anything we haven't seen countless times before. The film ends abruptly and with no real conclusion, leaving the viewer puzzled and more than a little disappointed.",

I had good hope for this movie, but right from the start it took time for it to get into its \"groove\". Some parts were indeed scary, I'll admit that much. However, being so damn similar to other movies like Paranormal Activity(which was done on purpose) it just doesn't have the same effect. The movie even opens so questions that you expect to be answered, only to be disappointed that they are barely covered before the end. Oh and the ending, it was too predictable. Fancy in its own way, but pretty much the same crap from recent horror films. The people in the room were pissed, and so was I that I spent hard earned money on a spin-off of Paranormal Activity. It's not a horrible movie, but barely worth going to the movies for, I reccomend renting it instead when it comes out on Bluray or DVD.   --------Wanna go watch a good horror exorcism movie?

Not predictable in the sense that you will know what will happen at the end when the movie starts. but as the movie unravels, you will be able to tell what is around a corner or what will happen in the next minutes of viewing.

Movies like the typical Halloween slashing genre do nothing for me.  My rating of The Devil Inside is based on similar genre of devil or exorcists movies.  With the classic The Exorcists being the golden bar of devil movies, I have seen most every other exorcist related movies.  I would put this movie (Devil Inside) at number 2 behind \"the Exorcist.\"  It is better than the Last Exorcism, much better than are the sequels  (Prequels) to the Exorcist, better than Exorcisim of Emily Rose, and most recently The Rite.  The movie stars slow and feeds the viewer in morsels until the awesome climax toward the end.  The characters are likable with the exception of the camera guy.  Good acting performance from all.  There were several scenes that made me squirm in my seat.  Many disturbing scenes.  This is the type of movie where you will be glad to live with someone you trust and not alone.  It is one of those movies that will stay with you.  My guess is the negative reviews are from some people who are anti-Judeo Christian or anti-Catholicism.  There is no way this movie is less than 7/10. I liked the ending as it was unexpected and different.  This movie was better than expected and I recommend it be seen in the theatres.

I'll admit my curiosity got the better of me and I must say, I should have listened. This movie is a serious waste of time and if you too are curious to see what all the fuss is about, don't. Do not waste your time with this movie, watch another movie or go outside. Hell, watching paint dry would be a better use of your time than to subject yourself to this. I don't even know where to begin. This is pretty much a combination between The Exorcist and Paranormal activity as well as a few other titles in that mix. There is nothing new that you haven't seen before which makes the movie seem even more pointless and an even bigger waste of your time. Not only that, but it's just downright boring(and that's the least of the problems). There's only really one or two creepy moments and they're in the condensed 2 minute trailer which to me, is a better and more enjoyable experience. Characterization is pretty much non existent so I didn't really care at all what happened to these people. The plot and story are paper thin. The whole story is just Isabella (Fernanda Andrade) going to Rome to see her mother and then convinces these two priests to perform an exorcism on her. That's it, and I don't care(nor do I entirely believe) that this was based on a true story. I'm sure what happened was probably horrible but that doesn't mean that it'll make a great movie, case point: The Devil Inside. The acting is just okay. It's not bad but, none of it is really effective or memorable. The pacing of the movie is off, it starts off slow then picks up when they perform an exorcist on this girl, then it slows down only to pick up again. However, none of these are the biggest problem. The biggest problem and sin was the ending. It's as if the writers didn't know what to do so they probably decided that, \"eh this is good enough lets just end it.\" It's so abrupt and leaves so many things unresolved, it truly is one of the worst endings in history. However, thank god this movie is mercifully short(clocking in at only 75 minutes) because if I had to endure another 10 or 15 minutes of this **** I would have begged for one of those demons to transfer to me. It would have been a less painful experience to be possessed than sitting through anymore of this abomination. Overall, even though there are one or two creepy moments they're in the trailer, which you're much better off watching. This is a rip-off of pretty much every Poisson movie ever made. There's barely any characterization, story, and plot. The acting is so-so and the ending is horrendously awful, just truly the worst. Somehow this manage to make $100 million worldwide on a budget of only $1 million, so because of this expect to see many more of these types of movies, thanks world. Editions like these into the found footage genre are better left UN-found.",

It is a complete waste of time and money. For those of you who have, I'm sorry you had to sit through that piece of garbage.If any of you spent money and saw \"The House of the Dead\", you'll know what I mean. Literally, I cannot get back that 1 hour and 20 minutes and the money I spent on admission and concession. The movie is a 'found' docu-drama which is movie medium too prolific for its own good. It movie tries to be \"The Blair Witch Project\" and epically fails to live up to that standard. The blatant plagarism of a scene from \"Paranormal Activity\" should have been a big warning sign this wasn't going to be good. You figure out the end-plot 5 minutes in at 'Exorcism School' which is transference of multiple possession; the big scare is a dog jumping at a fence at the characters going to their first exorcism; the shocking part is the baby drowing scene by a priest; the gross-out scene is a woman having her 'period' during an exorcisim; and the people who end up possessed or dead you really don't care for - they are either dumb (Michael), egotistical (Ben), forgettable (Isabella), or just plain sad (David). Oh yeah, SPOILER ALERT, but WHO CARES it is in the title! It ends with the demon claiming to be the Devil himself and then the movie ends in a car crash. Talk about a just and final ending much like the movie itself, a wreck. This isn't even a B movie its more like a Z movie.",

WhatIsabella travels to Italy along with a documentary filmmaker hoping that together they can unravel the mystery behind her mother's failed exorcism, which resulted in the deaths of three clergymen in the basement of her childhood home. What they discover will be more shocking than anything they could have imagined as they enlist the help of two newly-ordained exorcists to help free her mother from demonic possession. THE DEVIL INSIDE exacerbates an already unlikely scenario using the popular \"found footage\" technique, which works as a disadvantage just as much as it aids in the realism on screen. It is difficult to accept that the governing bodies in the hospitals and churches would allow a cameraman to enter, let alone the fact that he would jeopardize his well-being for the sake of the film. The style does produce some truly unnerving moments, however, particularly in the disturbing basement exorcism in which contortionist Pixie Le Knot performs several gut-wrenching maneuvers. The story quickly loses focus and asks way too much of its audience as we near the final third of the film, at which point it becomes entirely unbelievable. The filmmakers then have the audacity to hock the film's website for updates on the case, as if anyone would visit after being left with such a jumbled and inconclusive ending. Momentary shocks are not enough to win over modern audiences, who crave convincing characters and storytelling with their scares.",

Isabella seeks to understand the truth behind the horrific events and to find out if her mother really is possessed.  Attempts to cure Maria using unconventional, Vatican-prohibited exorcism methods go awry, and they discover that Maria is possessed by more than one demon, which will not go quietly.This ever-popular genre of cinema adds to its encyclopedic index a forgettable, lacklustre entry; a clichÃ© lost amongst the listings of its scarier, more effective supernatural found-footage counterparts, such as The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity.The sheer lameness of The Devil Inside is difficult to overstate.  It is nothing more than a cheap, uneventful production made worse by robotic, unconvincing acting and a blatant lack of effort in creating thrills and chills.Despite some genuinely disturbing scenes where innocent characters become possessed contortionists and an unnerving scene with Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley) in her room at the Centrino Hospital for the Criminally Insane, The Devil Inside is, quite frankly, boring.Amateur in all its constituent elements â",

Then, you have to generate a genuine sense of tension and fear for the fate of these characters. None of this happens in 'The Devil Inside'. There are no characters. There is no fear. There is only 80-so-minutes (It felt eternal) of blatantly blasting on the church, exorcism scenes that reek of plagiarism from 'The Exorcist' (what's with all these horny demons?), and flat out unintentionally funny moments.

Well, whatever devil is inside you was obviously inside the writers if they came up with this crap",

It could have been really good and scary but all it was, was dumb and gory. Sure it had like 2 creepy parts, but not near enough to keep you constantly excited. The absolute worst part was the climax, if you call that a climax.",

Oh god was i wrong. With the most generic and typical plot ever with absolutelt no surprises to be found. With most jumpscares actually being predictable and the acting being pretty boring really, no real effort made by actors to make it same scary. There is also no suspense and worst of all the practically is no ending. The ending is literally one of the most frustrating things you could ever see if that isn't the whole film in the first place. Utterly terrible. Pretty sure this was just another one of these found footage cash grabs baring in mind horror is typically the cheapest genre of films to make and the easiest to get a lot of people to see.",

The film draws on so many other sources that it has trouble establishing its own identity.Another film attempting to cash in on the recent handy-cam craze, it is a faux-documentary that follows a woman trying to discover what went wrong in her mother's exorcism 20 years prior, which resulted in the deaths of three people and a life-long spell for her mother in an insane asylum.A fairly unoriginal, but decent enough premise. The film does actually make some interesting commentary on the bureaucracy of the Catholic Church, and contains one or two well-timed scares. But the film is let down by clichéd jump-out-of-your-seat moments that you can see coming from a mile away, like the unexplained orchestral booming noise that occurs whenever the camera looks at something scary, and a ridiculously abrupt ending that stops the film dead in its tracks.If you're gonna go with the whole \"found-footage\" thing, you have to keep it discreet. It's dangerous to show too much, whereas the likes of Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity did mostly suggestion work. Hell, even Cloverfield didn't let you see too much of the monster. The Devil Inside just keeps throwing too much in your face, and it becomes predictable.",

Despite a plot that's prettyI read on the very trusted source of Wikipedia that this movie is considered one of the worst horror movies ever made. While it wasn't necessarily good, The Devil Inside wasn't the huge failure I was expecting. Despite a plot that's pretty difficult to follow, this movie does have some creepy moments. It never actually becomes anything particularly scary, but there are a couple of scenes that can get under your skin. There are two exorcism scenes that are pretty entertaining to watch. The cast works decently well together even if their characters aren't completely fleshed out, but that obviously because of its criminally short running time. I'm not kidding; this movie clocks in at 75 minutes. Another reason for its appalling length is because, strangely enough, the movie ends before the climax. There's no big \"twist\" that seems to pop up in every movie nowadays, there's no payoff for any of the conflicts presented in the film, and it ends in such an abrupt fashion that I swear, the editor must have accidentally taken the last 20 minutes off of this movie. The sudden and unimaginably anticlimactic ending has garnered so much hate on the internet that it's regarded as one of the worst endings in film history, and to be honest, I can't find a more unsatisfying ending in any movie I've seen. Other than the atrocious ending, there are a lot of conflicts that are dropped partway through the movie without any resolution, which is what makes the plot so difficult to follow. Even the primary conflict is dropped without any closure right after a vaguely interesting and creepy exorcism scene. Even with its poor plot and shockingly bad ending, it's still not the biggest offender of this movie. The Devil Inside is, in one word, boring. Other than those few unsettling scenes, the movie is filled with ramblings of the main characters about demons, exorcisms, and the Catholic church. I know I'm making this sound like The Devil Inside lives up to its title of one of the worst horror movies of all time, but you could do a lot worse than this.",

And when the film is shot using the \"found footage\"Whenever I go to see a horror film I do it with caution. It is a genre that I like, I confess, but it has so much garbage that its really difficult to find a movie that is worthwhile. And when the film is shot using the \"found footage\" technique, I fear the worst. In this specific case, all of my fears were well founded.The film, like many others before and after, focuses on Catholic exorcism and does so, like many other films, in a way that borders the absurd. Without wanting to pull out of gallons that I feel I neither possess nor deserve, let me clarify that I am a Catholic, I go to mass, I even know many priests, deacons and some bishops, so I have a good knowledge about the Church. So I can say that whoever has the minimum knowledge of Catholic rituals knows very well that everything this film shows is **** and worse, **** copied from the famous film \"The Exorcist\". Even some of the priests lines are identical! The difference is that \"The Exorcist\" pays off in other aspects, such as the quality and commitment of everyone involved, the intensity of the scenes, etc. It is a magnificent film and it gives us what this film cannot give: tension, suspense, fear.What is Catholic exorcism? The film takes the subject but does not develop it. Allow me to clarify: exorcism is a sacramental that has to be authorized by a bishop and done by a properly qualified priest, but that is only used as a last resort and when there is medical and psychiatric support, that is, when medicine and psychiatry feel that they can no longer help. You cannot do an exorcism without permission or without the presence of able people, including a doctor, and in fact there is no filming. The film mentions this, and does it well, but then it puts priests in blatant disobedience. I do not know if it would be the case for an excommunication, as one of the characters says, but I am sure that these priests would have been immediately suspended and could even be forbidden from practising priestly duties. Therefore, everything we see in this film is an excuse for a carnival that the film calls exorcism. The story itself and the construction of the characters is highly deficient.The cast doesn't help, but I don't blame the actors. The failure of the film comes, clearly, from a bad script and the bad material given to the cast. Suzan Crowley was the best actress here, with a convincing performance of madness that really works well. The Brazilian Fernanda Andrade can join the list of Brazilian actors who made the leap to the USA but was not particularly happy in this film. Simon Quarterman and Evan Helmuth were mediocre.At a technical level, the film is globally bad. The best was the performance of the stunts, generally anonymous, who brought to life the contortionism and the most violent scenes. It takes elasticity to achieve those, and people who did it here deserve applause. For the rest, we can point out the bad cinematography, in the worst \"found footage\" style, that do not even know how to take advantage of the beauty of the city of Rome. The sets and costumes are monotonous and the soundtrack is not even worth mentioning.",
