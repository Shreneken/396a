In orderThe Revenant centers around a fallen soldier who somehow finds he has joined the ranks of the living dead. Bart Gregory has just recently been laid to rest - so why is he still up and walking around? The only person Bart can turn to for answers is his best friend Joey, and before long the two pals have surmised that blood is life. In order to survive, Bart requires a steady supply of it. Convinced that no one will miss the drug dealers and killers who have transformed LA into a swirling cesspool of crime and vice, the two friends decide to do law enforcement a favor by cleaning up the streets while collecting the precious blood needed to keep poor Bart from withering away into dust!

  "critic_reviews": [
    "Made with a chip on its shoulder and a generational insight that would put most Oscar bait to shame, this completely daft film deserves to be seen by anyone who remotely supports the potential of the horror genre, to frighten, to disgust and to anger.",
    "It almost continuously gets darker, funnier and edgier as it goes along.",
    "The result is a horror film that progresses organically and unpredictably, even willing to take a turn for the tragic, if that's what's inevitable.",
    "An often hilarious living-dead comedy that just had to happen, given the current hunger for zombies, vampires and other things that refuse to keel over.",
    "A middling zombie movie elevated by clever writing and gooeylicious special effects, Kerry Prior's Revenant toys with big themes but settles for uneasy laughs.",
    "About 30 minutes too long and somewhat clumsily executed, this zombie's-eye-view story still manages to evoke the comic and splattery spirit of the best '80s cult horror flicks (and features a car-horn shout-out to \"The Lost Boys,\" to boot).",
    "Ultimately suffers from an uneven execution and repetitive overload.",
    "Horror comedies can be wildly entertaining -- \"The Return of the Living Dead,\" from 1985, for instance. It sends up horror movies in hilarious fashion while still managing to be gross-out scary. The Revenant never rises to that level. Nor does it seem to want to.",
    "The Revenant kind of aspires to be a horror-comedy in the vein of \"Shaun of the Dead\" but keeps tripping on its own misanthropy.",
    "Since Bart's bloodlust is never matched in tenor by his righteousness, the story remains rife with unfulfilled moral inquiry.",
    "Both the yuks and the yucks are plentiful, but by the time the film reaches a montage sequence of these two boneheads (well, one bonehead, one dope) laying waste to Los Angeles gang members and other wastrels in an attempt to satiate Bart's thirst for the red stuff, you're more than likely wishing you were watching Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in something else entirely. The similarities between the two horror comedy pairings are just too obvious to be ruled out as coincidence.",
    "By the middle of the second hour, you'll be wishing a zombie would just chomp off your head to end the pain."

I totally expected this movie to be a mediocre b-rated horror comedy but I was dead wrong. I was literally laughing out loud on several occassions.The interesting thing is the movie is more than just a comedy too... there were times during the movie where I was genuinely disturbed and also sad. The 2 main actors are rock solid and the supporting cast is great except for 2 extra soldier dudes in the 1st 5 minutes of the film. I reccomend this movie to anyone... doesn't matter if you are a fan of the genre or not. This one is a guaranteed future cult classic. Oh and the critics must have seen a different film, or they are mentally challenged, because there is no way this should be getting mixed reviews.",

It's an interesting take on horror/comedy that doesn't involve zombies, vampires, or werewolves.  David Anders and Chris Wylde both did a great job as buddies dealing with a \"unique\" situation.

The main flaw is that very little is done to explain how revenants happen, but by the end you probably won't care.  Not quite as funny as Scouts' Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse and nowhere near the sly masterpiece of Wyrmwood: Road of the Dead but definitely a must watch for any fan of the undead genre.",
