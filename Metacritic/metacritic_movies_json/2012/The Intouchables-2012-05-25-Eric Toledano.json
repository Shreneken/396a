    "critic_reviews": [
        "Enjoy this movie for what it is - the kind of motion picture that can cause Champaign-like giddiness - and don't obsess over how true-to-life this work of fiction is.",
        "Let me come clean right now and tell you that I enjoyed The Intouchables quite a bit. If you're looking for a lightweight summer change of pace, with just a smidgen of Continental flair, here it is.",
        "It's the kind of movie that inspires word-of-mouth recommendations by speaking the international language of culture clash.",
        "The Intouchables works as a crowd-pleaser not because it's true, but because it's a plausible enchantment.",
        "The Intouchables is an exuberantly charming French buddy comedy that proves an audience will suspend disbelief and follow an unlikely story as long as it's superbly crafted.",
        "It has warmth, humor and an understated sweetness that is not to be taken for granted.",
        "What it provides (instead of the thematically clever dialogue of typically subtle French comedy) is biting wit, poignancy and, forsaking some structural nuisances, the summer's best bromance.",
        "There are plenty of reasons not to like The Intouchables, but Omar Sy's terrific performance blows right past them.",
        "Not a great film but a warm one that pushes the viewer's emotional buttons so deftly it feels like a massage. My guess is that you will laugh and cry at all appropriate moments. Resistance is futile.",
        "The film fulfills its feel-good promise, as long as it's seen as the fairy tale it was meant to be.",
        "Take from the film's racial commingling what you want. Much of this may be old hat, even corny, and potentially offensive, but I haven't laughed out loud this often at a movie in ages.",
        "It's worth noting that this movie is loosely based on actual people \u2013 except the real-life Driss character is, in fact, an Arab. If Driss had been an Arab, The Intouchables would have waded into less navigable waters, but it might have made for a tougher movie.",
        "The power dynamic may charm the French, but it's likely to push the cringe buttons of local moviegoers in Obama's post-\"The Green Mile America.\" Apart from the wince-inducing moments, The Intouchables is often a pleasant buddy picture.",
        "It's the classic odd-couple buddy movie setup, only it'll pull at your heartstrings, whether you want it too or not. And you won't want it to, because it's sap.",
        "This is a story that has been told time and again in the movies, and sometimes the performances overcome the condescension of the formula.",
        "Sy and Cluzet are superb actors who demolish stereotypes about race and social class by finding a common humanity in their characters. Acting this good forgives a lot of sins.",
        "A box office phenomenon in France, this crowd-pleasing drama is based on a true story but sticks closely to the template for a Hollywood buddy movie.",
        "It is possible to summarize the experience of watching The Intouchables in nine words: You will laugh; you will cry; you will cringe.",
        "In this sentimental feel-good saga of an ultra-wealthy quadriplegic and the petty criminal who becomes his caretaker, the chemistry between the two lead actors goes a considerable way toward elevating the broad-strokes culture clash. That's crucial to a film that is, in essence, a love story.",
        "Actually, The Intouchables isn't bad - its merely shameless, but at least it's overtly so.",
        "Sy and Cluzet give their parts more conviction than they deserve, even when the former is forced to re-enact the falsetto-singing-in-the-bubblebath bit from Pretty Woman. But even their energy can't revive a corpse this dead.",
        "The lens through which the The Intouchables was filmed may be too rose-colored for some people's taste, but the window that these talented performers throw open -- a window onto the strange and touching friendship between two very different men -- is crystal clear.",
        "Some of the elements in the film are inexplicable and some are undeveloped, but there are a handful of nicely crafted set pieces.",
        "This tired little movie got on my last nerve. If Driss is so charismatic and so full of ingenuity, why isn't he using any of that skill to help lift up his family?",
        "\"Driving Miss Daisy\" this ain't. Except that it sort of is.",
        "This essentially good-natured movie, a massive hit in France, is more likely to strike American audiences as trite than offensive.",
        "Corny, calculating and commercial...Their slickly executed culture-clash character piece is stuffed chock full of hard-knock life lessons that owe much more to the conventions of the screen than the tough realities of social deprivation and of the severely handicapped.",
        "Cluzet and Sy nonetheless make for ingratiating foils; the extended opening sequence in which the duo outwits a pair of cops like a hell-raising Laurel and Hardy could be a stellar short comedy if it weren't married to the deadly self-serious shtick that follows.",
        "A cheeky dream-drama about the friendship between a rich, white quadriplegic and a penurious black job-seeker, the premise of The Intouchables alone nearly renders analysis redundant.",
        "Though never known for their subtlety, French co-helmers/scripters Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache have never delivered a film as offensive as \"Untouchable,\" which flings about the kind of Uncle Tom racism one hopes has permanently exited American screens."

This picture treats topics such as humanity and feeling humanized. Philippe is a quadriplegic millionaire and everyone treats him like someone with a condition, until he meets Driss, a black man who had been recently in jail. The thing that captivates the protagonist is that Driss forget about his condition and treats him as an equal; Philippe finally could feel like a real human being.\rAnother interesting thing of the movie is the title Intouchables, referring to Philippe and Driss, because they both are marginalized from the society, the first one have a condition and the other is an ex-convict. All this can be notice in the relation that this both men have with their families. Ones go to the birthday of the millionaire just to see if he is still alive, and the others kicked out Driss from his home.\rDespite the film is very slowly, the humor is great and sophisticated.

Directed by Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache, the film revolves around two very different men, each looking for someone or something to mitigate their current situations; circumstances that are far from favorable. The first is a Senegalese immigrant named Driss (Omar Sy) who lives anyway he can. He resides in the crime-ridden projects outside Paris, France, where he commutes by foot, and is in the process of recovering from his stint in prison that's lasted six months. Looking to find a solid line of employment, one that will limit his time off the streets, Driss lands a job as a caregiver to an affluent quadriplegic Phillipe (Francois Cluzet). This premise provides the framework for the evolving relationship of two very different people, joined together by means of business. While the film does make certain of its \"based on a true story\" visage, it, in reality, is far more fictionalized than true (the real-life Driss, for example, was an Arab named Abdel). When asked why the filmmakers opted to make the casting change to include a black aide, they made the case they wanted Omar Sy. That's fine, he is more than qualified; he did beat out Jean Dujardin's role in \"The Artist\" for last years French Cesar Award. However, some of the scenes he's in, feel overly cliche, corny, and forced; think \"Earth, Wind, and Fire.\" Moreover, as a whole, 'Intouchables' also contains a great many plot twists and character developments that seem to come from nowhere at unspecified times. Even more, and vexing of all, is the amount of exaggeration and lingering sense of insincerity that is never quite lifted from the film's intended \"feel-good\" aura; the film tries to offer something so absurdly inconceivable while not explaining how it all could be considered plausible. Instead, one is left to contemplate what might have been if the holey script would have placed more focus on developing the characters, and the situations that surround them. Notwithstanding its continuation of subterfuge, 'Intouchables' is held together by an earnest devotion to humanity, with its writers paying careful attention to delineating stability from adversity, and the persevering will by each man to accept the other, turning what would otherwise be constant cliche into an affecting camaraderie that is brought to form by Sy and Cluzet who possess a surprising chemistry to the screen. Further, while the copious subplots flirt with vapidity, often detailing personal despair, the film remains apt with the frequent gauging and testing of the men's representative comfort levels that the audience can see and feel teetertotter before their very eyes. Ultimately, 'Intouchables' liege disposition to value interpersonal affection over flattering dishonesty solidifies its connection with audience, and almost compensates for its few-too-many moments of self-inflicted abashment. It's the leads who salvage this lightly-intense European-pop-culture-phenomenon. Don't like it...you can blame the French.",

I had no idea how great this film would be and I am very,A soulful and near-to-perfect French language drama film written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, The Intouchables is one of the most genuine surprises of this year. I had no idea how great this film would be and I am very, very glad that I had been waiting to watch this for a long time. The excellent incorporation of drama, slight humor, good song selection, delicacy of the intense joyful/saddening moments and those silly jokes are what make this film so great. The direction is so superb at times that even the saddening moments can make you laugh at times with the inclusion of those silly jokes.\rOf course, the review would be incomplete without mentioning the wonderful performances by Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet, that are totally worth appreciating. They are the souls of this film, they generate that fantastic charisma which is enough to keep you interested in the film. The storyline is fresh, as it is also based on a true story and it moves you emotionally and what's best about it that it doesn't deviate from the true purpose of the movie despite the fact that it covers almost every aspect of drama in a single plot. I'm not going to spoil it for you by discussing the plot of the film.\rThis film has done much business on Box Office in France and it may also be the biggest blockbuster because it is that great, people are really loving it. I LOVED IT. It has also been shortlisted in the Best Foreign Language Film category of 85th Academy Awards. This is an honor for a film to be selected out of more than 70 films submitted for Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. Additionally, it is also nominated for Best Foreign Language Film category of 70th Golden Globe Awards. Don't read critics' reviews and take a pass on this one, this movie has much to offer once you are ready to accept it.\rLong story short, The Intouchables is one of my top favorite films of 2012.",

With 'The Intouchables', a movie based on a true story which focuses on a wealthy man named Philippe (Francois Cluzet) who has been paralyzed from the neck down, and his journey with his friendship with a street man named Driss (Omar Sy). They start out with their different lives where Philippe is looking for carers, but none of them seem to fit Philippe's standards in what he looks for in a carer. Driss decides to apply for being Philippe's carer believing that this could be his fresh start in life. Many of Philippe's friends are concerned given Driss's tough past, but Philippe prefers the not-so-sentimental attitude he brings to his life. \"No pity\" he claims he prefers. We see their relationship grow as they become more fond of each other as time goes on. They also start to get to know each other better, and it seems that their friendship will never be broken. I admired the good nature and cheerful tone that this film brings. It will warm even the most cynical movie-goer, and the performances by the two lead actors are fantastic.

The structure of the premise is simple and familiar to the audience with an appealing details of the characteristics of the characters and the analysis of the relationship among them, which fortunately in here is in plethora of it. The chemistry between the lead cast is the heart of the feature that keeps the audience tangled in its sensitive bubble despite of having ups and downs. It also is flawed and cheesy at times that shucks away the somewhat credibility it gains with tiny genuinely moving notions. It is short on technical aspects like background score, cinematography, sound department and editing although the camera work is appreciative as it manually handled that offers the viewers the aspiring personal experience. As mentioned earlier, Cluzet and Sy has invested all their chips in, and it pays more than well enough to keep the audience rooting for their friendship. As much as compelling the storytelling is, in its primary track, the rest of the plot and characters are left undercooked and chalky that aches you till the last frame of the feature. Ticking for almost two hours, it easily stretches its way down the road to offer a moot and expected point with a familiar zeal that actually ignited the whole concept. The husbandry gags that are imputed in order to make the relationship more rich that enhances it to a more sensible ground and the gripping screenplay that enfolds guilty pleasures for the viewers are the high points of the feature. The Intouchables may not be accurately titled if considered its existence, that is more physical than spiritual, contrary to what makers claims it to be.",

She did not know anything about him or read any of them. It was a shot in the dark. And I'm glad I did it. I loved the movie when I saw it and now, reviewing it at home, I continued to feel happy about the time I gave to this work. It is a film based on real facts that occurred from the relationship between a rich French aristocrat and his trusted servant, an Algerian who lived in the suburbs. Here, however, the African origin of the servant is reinforced by the intentional choice of a black actor, Omar Sy, while the other role was given to veteran Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet. Both actors were capable of exceptional chemistry and look fantastic when they split the screen. Sy's jokes, in his character, are laughing to tears. The cinematography and the scenery are very good and the soundtrack, Ludovico Einaudi's responsibility, is simply a masterpiece of \"contemporary\" classical music. It is certainly the best French film I have seen in many years, and one of the best films that European cinema has given us during this decade, until now.",

That's becauseThe Intouchables' story could be familiar to anybody, even to those who haven't seen a lot of movies. Almost every phase, and every point in this movie is so conventional and unoriginal. However, this movie is very remarkable! That's because it surpasses all the feel-good movies of its kind.Needless to mention the high-class direction from Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano that made this movie exceptional. Thanks to this superb direction, The Intouchables delivers broad laughs and tugs at the heartstrings without delving too deep, or present anything new. Sometimes the movie becomes so hilarious, and other times you couldn't help shedding some tears, often, of joy! The best thing about this movie that it kept its lighter tone throughout its runtime. The tonal shift when the movie moves from its second to its third act wasn't smooth, though. That being said, you will never find any movie of this kind that has half its magical moments.The friendship between Philippe and Driss is simply unparalleled. That's, of course, due to the insanely magnetic chemistry between Omar Sy and Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet. I bet you can find such chemistry in any other movie of the same kind.The soundtrack is perfectly utilized to match the movie's bright tone. And the cinematography is beautiful, but what I think made the movie looks spectacular is its fancy production design.The third act is definitely a bit rushed but I feel like the ending more than makes up for it. This ending could be the sweetest and most charming ending ever. You couldn't decide if you should cry or laugh, but don't worry because you would do both.(8/10)",

A beautiful story of friendship and all negative reviews have been by snowflakes hell bent on negative political correctness. Everyone is up a height because one half of the two leads has been cast as a poor, black drug user and God forbid this fits with some stereo type that drug users be young black men.If you aren't some little poncey PC do gooder that whines at every little slightly inappropriate thing then you'll likely be in the upper score card on this film.It's funny, with for a change some great acting and a lovely little piano song in with the OST. It's a very moving film too.Ignore the low reviews that are there on some sort of political stance.The person the lead role was portraying, was apparently a career criminal in real life but not black, black. Just slightly dark skin, so if this offends you having a full black man, smoking a bit of weed playing the lead, then take a hike.",

While the movie doesn't have a huge buildup towards the ends, and it contains movie clich\u00e9s, The Intouchables makes it work. I would even argue that the somewhat uneventful plot makes this movie so enjoyable. The movie is not about the events in Philippe's or Driss' lives, it's about how they grow as persons. For me, this movie is mostly about inner growth and how we can be brothers and sisters to each other despite our twisted minds.The Intouchables has become one of my favourite movies because of its uniqueness. But I understand why this is not the movie for everybody. Where the movie really shines is the character development, the beautiful shots and scenery and of course the humor.",
