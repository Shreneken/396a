  "critic_reviews": [
    "The soulless-ness of their empty plot of track homes and super-store existence invokes both \"Poltergeist\" and \"Employee of the Month.\"",
    "To those of us in the audience who might be strangers in paranormal precincts, it looks suspiciously like a séance.",
    "The Apparition is not a great or even good haunted-house movie, but it does have the advantage of a memorable setting.",
    "At one point Ben helpfully looks under the house to see what might be causing the ruckus. \"Watch out for spiders!\" Kelly says. Actually, Ben - and the filmmakers - have a lot more to worry about.",
    "Lincoln's script has no knack for the pacing of cinematic exorcisms, and the truncated climax he does offer is short on action and scares.",
    "An incomprehensibly garbled, derivative attempt at a horror flick from first-time writer-director Todd Lincoln.",
    "A plodding, undercooked, and old-fashioned (not in a good way, either) chiller that will bore you to tears instead of scare you to death.",
    "It's a potentially creepy setting that would give an innovative director a chance to do a lot with a little. Unfortunately, Lincoln isn't one of those.",
    "This enervating muddle of paranormal nonsense manages the difficult feat of seeming frenzied and lethargic all at once, while building toward the sort of ludicrous cop-out climax that often incites die-hard genre fans to shout rude things at the screen.",
    "The Apparition turns out to be nothing more than a series of feebly constructed \"Boo!\" scenes tacked together to achieve (barely) feature length.",
    "With more telegraphed scares than Samuel Morse on Halloween, it still might give you a restless night, but only because you fell asleep in the theater.",
    "The story is a worthy one, but the film lacks any daring expressive touches that might have made it, at the very least, noteworthy.",
    "Come to think of it, it's a lot like the departed shade of a better, longer movie, hovering in tatters before us, vanishing when we blink. When you look into this abyss, it yawns back at you."

It's bland, like over-chewed gum that's long since lost its flavor.  It's uninspired, incoherent, and overall inept.    The story can't make up its mind who the ghost is, how many ghosts there are, or whether they're ghosts or something else.  There's so much babble standing in for dialog about psychic bomb shelters and spectral beacons that confuses the story rather than clarifying it.  Greene's performance ranges from swimsuit to naughty nightie.    Nothing works in The Apparition.  The actors struggle with their roles, the parts are underwritten, the story is underpopulated, scenes go nowhere, the score is synthetic and intrusive, the editing is too busy, and The Apparition has nothing to say.  The Apparition does not deserve a theatrical release, but should haunt the $5 bins at Wal-Mart for all eternity.",

It has a setting and idea that could have proven to be terrifying but in the end the scariest thing about it is how bad it is. Because the movie isn't scary it ends up being nothing more than a boring waste of time, and we all know how valuable you time is so just skip this movie. Also helping bring the movie down is the weak script and bad acting. Only one good thing can be said about this movie and that's that Ashley Greene is super hot, but no matter how hot she is this movie is still a waste of time.",

This movie is sold boldly advertising the movie's very final frame, which was even at the end of the trailer, thus ruining any shock or surprise value their last and biggest card could have possibly held. Outside of that, I'm surprised to see such low ratings here - it's really nowhere near that bad a film. Yeah, it's pretty unsurprising - but on the other hand, the characters aren't written as laughable cardboard cutouts who can't hope to pull off a believable person. The characters here are likeable and genuine, and even though the ending wasn't what I was looking for, the rest of the movie to a lesser degree was sort of what I wanted to see. It doesn't rely on cheap scares or gore to pretend to frighten us - it relies on PG-13, if not cliched, images and suspense tactics that are decent, if not \"seen before\". Overall, I rate it only slightly above a 5 for giving me some real characters for once.",
