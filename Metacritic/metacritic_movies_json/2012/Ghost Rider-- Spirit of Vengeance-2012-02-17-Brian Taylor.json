  "critic_reviews": [
    "Directed by the team of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, the new film brings all the cartoonish insanity of the pair's Crank saga to the -- let's face it -- cartoonishly insane concept of the Ghost Rider, a burning skeleton in leather who rides an equally fiery motorcycle. It's a match made in, er, hell.",
    "A goofy, gonzo thrill ride, “Vengeance” is a bad movie sequel so bad it’s good, a bad movie that’s almost a great bad movie.",
    "This doesn't lack for crazy charm, particularly when Nicolas Cage (in his go-for-broke Bad Lieutenant mode) and Ciaran Hinds (playing the devil) try to out-weird each other with broad, even cartoonish performances.",
    "The film, though, has some redeeming qualities, including the presence of Idris Elba as the obligatory good guy, who encourages Johnny to get Danny into the protective custody of a religious order.",
    "Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance offers Cage plenty of opportunities to tap his inner circus geek, to twitch, cackle and flail without shame, going full tilt batwing crazy. Not since he danced in a pagan bear suit in The Wicker Man has Cage appeared this unconcerned about what the audience will think.",
    "The smugness of the film grows wearying long before the end. Just because the people on and behind the camera are willing to acknowledge what we're watching is ridiculous crap doesn't really change the fact that, well, it is.",
    "Spirit of Vengeance is so focused and, as a result, so impoverished that you actually feel bad for Cage. The actor tries to bring the weird (though at this point one wonders if he can even do anything else) but the film more often than not leaves him high and dry, saddling him with standard-issue action hero lines and boilerplate action set-pieces.",
    "Cage-ophiles will find some delectable freakouts in Blaze's transformation - or near transformation - scenes. Otherwise, the committee-penned script combines yokel-friendly haw-haw irreverence (non-sequitur cutaways to the Rider pissing in a flamethrower pattern) and sweaty monologues about \"controlling the Rider\" (the character is basically a mean drunk's superhero).",
    "So it's a half-certainty, half-shock that Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is both good and bad, a sequel that's hungry for thrills but bereft of the cohesiveness - and budget - to be a full meal.",
    "The picture is still much too rickety, slapdash and surprisingly dull to qualify as a good barrel-bottom pleasure.",
    "With his (Cage) over-the-top delivery and operatically intense facial expressions, there's no way anyone could accuse him of phoning this one in.",
    "Alas, unlike the duo's Crank films - also about a hero on the verge of explosion - Spirit of Vengeance lacks a solid gimmick to unify their transgressive gambits.",
    "The first \"Ghost Rider\" film, directed by Mark Steven Johnson, was sort of a fizzy goof, the kind of movie where you don't expect much and then think, \"Hey, that was actually kind of fun.\" Spirit of Vengeance, though, is undone by increased expectations, as promising more only makes it feel they are somehow delivering less.",
    "A water-treading sequel offering just enough kooky color to keep less-discerning funnybook fans occupied, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance nudges its obscure hero's mythology forward a bit without seeming to care much how it gets there.",
    "Like \"Ghost Rider: Low Voltage,\" this is a surprisingly underpowered excursion into Marvel's mad world by Neveldine and Taylor. More purgatory than hellfire.",
    "The charismatic Idris Elba debuts in a key role as an alcoholic priest who recruits Cage's unique services. Yet instead of elevating the franchise, Ghost Rider: Spirit Of Vengeance ends up squandering even more potential.",
    "Most of the movie's action-horror set pieces play like lame Gwar music video outtakes, and Cage's signature mix of irony and off-the-rails mugging only works when you can see the actor's face. In Ghost Rider form, his character is just a skeletal automaton with neither a tongue nor a cheek to put it in.",
    "This time out, the action is in 3-D, which amounts to a few shots of flaming motorcycle parts comin' at ya, but little else.",
    "For acting to be this bad in movie not directed by Michael Bay or George Lucas, it has to be intentional.",
    "The only part of this movie anyone's ever going to remember is the pair of scenes in which Ghost Rider pees flame.",
    "To question where things went wrong feels somehow strange, as the project seems to have been ill-conceived from the very start.",
    "One look at the dreadful mess that is Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance will turn your whisper into a primal Cage scream: MAKE THIS MOVIE STOP!"

ItBig fan of the first Ghost Rider movie, so I was really looking forward to this one. The trailers made it look like an awesome, crazy, and over the top action movie with some hilarious moments, however the movie failed to deliver that. It seems to me like the people behind this movie couldn't decide what they wanted to do with this movie. It couldn't decide whether to be some super serious movie, or the zany over the top, humorous movie the trailers showed. When it's trying to be serious it ends up being super boring, and when it's trying to be over the top it's like the director didn't know how to make it happen so it falls flat, and because of this the action scenes are really boring. It's got some funny moments, some intentional most not, but that's mostly do Nicolas Cage's performance, although I think most of my laughs were at his poor performance rather than genuine humor in the script. Actually just about every performance in this was poor. There are so many things wrong with this movie that I couldn't fit them all into this review, but by far the worst flaw this movie has it that at times you can see hints of a great movie in there. You'll only see them for a second, but their there and that's what makes it so sad. Even sadder is that most of the movies hints of greatness are also in the trailer.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nAll I can say is that this is a horrible movie that made me appreciate the first film even more. I didnt read Ghost Rider too often, but I knew Blaze's origins and I knew they at least tried to get it as close as possible at the front of the first film. Of course, the first film had its issues, but they are small compared to the garbage that this brings to the table. This film is called Ghost Rider... but he is only in for about Fifteen minutes. Unlike the first film, the action scenes are slow, and have no tension to them once you see the Rider just standing there with a bad guy who he's grabbed by the collar for over a minute and a half while said bad guy's mates are standing there doing nothing but looking dumb. Another mistake I noticed was that not only did they make Ghost Rider get hurt by explosives, but they make him immune to them less than twenty minutes later in the best action scene in the film which is far too short to be satisfying. The pace of this film by the way is simply unbearable. The story is garbage, and the plot takes too long to go somewhere. We are stuck in a church for what feels like an eternity explaining origins of the Ghost Rider and how to rid one of the curse (which I wont spoil, so true fans can simply rent the film). The effects are a mixed bag. Some of the time they look cool, but at other times they just dont look right at all. And there are some things I dont like that they were unable to do due to the STUPID budget constraints put on the film (you cant make this with fifty mil, its that simple). Things like Blazes bike not transforming when he becomes the rider anymore, or how when he takes over other mechanical objects like a truck, the only thing that changes is that they light on fire. Whatever, in the end the movie just feels really unfinished, and I know the minds behind Crank 1 and 2 are capable of much better things. The best part for me was in the middle of the film when Ghost Rider just lays destruction upon everything he sees with a giant piece of construction equippment. I at least got that out of it.",

Firstly, this is nothing like the first film. Everything is different, with the exception being Mr. Cage. It is very much a B-movie. Something you can imagine with lots of action, almost zero plot, and character development that seems to have gone up in smoke. It bears very little resemblence to the comic. It's a mash-up of Crank with a really bad B-action movie (think a recent Van Damm movie) and that it the best way to describe it.

Yeahh, you rite! It destroys everything in its path! From now on, whenever you hear the words GHOST RIDER, the first thing that comes to your mind it will be a veryy baddd movie! They definitely do not have enough good basic material to build a reasonable movie in the first place, thiz is for the second time! The first GHOST RIDER in 2007 was one of the ugliest superhero movies ever made. Anyway, I have my respect for the Directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor. Generally, I like their works especially the stylish camera angle and color structure. A little bit rough, energetic and sometimes comical, with fast moving scenes exactly like they had shown in CRANK (2006) and GAMER (2009). But that is certainly not enough. Thiz time, Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage), the alter-ego of Ghost Rider has to protect a child from the devil in human form upon the demand of a monk named Moreau (Idris Elba). The storyline is obviously weak in all aspects. They tell a simple story in long and boring 90+ minutes. Furthermore, the setting is told in Europe. Hello... where is the Europe? I do not see Europe! All I see is desert and rocky mountains in the middle of nowhere. After all, the Ghost Rider character is originally dark and mysterious. That atmosphere is clearly not shown here. They are using too much sick humor and too much clear blue sky, if you know what I mean. It crossed my mind, it could be totally different if they hire the Director who knows how to make a convincing shade of dark gothic like Tim Burton or Guillermo del Toro. The next thing is Nicolas Cage. I do not know what really happened to Cage, he is obviously trying to look cool with his cheesy one-liner dialogue. Moreover, in some scenes when Blaze struggled to hold back the devil inside him to come out, he creates a very strange and amusing expression. The rest of the Casts delivering B-Class performance such as: Idris Elba, Violante Placido, Johnny Whitworth, Christopher Lambert, even the child Fergus Riordan. the Devil once said to Johnny Blaze, You were the worst fricking deal I ever made. well, I have my complaint too, I just want my money back!\r Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",

And with David Goyer writing, it was expected to be better.  Graphically, GR looked much better.  He was much more of a character in this film.  Nic Cage's Johnny Blaze was much better. I loved that they skimmed over the origin.  It was very well done.  The action sequences were also top notch.  However, the bad is a mix of what is bad about film-making in general and the unmet expectations of comic book lovers for Marvel Knight characters in general.  Ghost Rider is a pseudo interesting character to begin with.  In theory, he should make a bad-ass film protagonist.  In reality, he's great in action and graphically, but even Goyer's writing skills can't make him that interesting. Like the abysmal attempts at getting a good Punisher on film, the reality is, the Marvel Knights characters will never make interesting films as long as the focus is on the violent part of their characters rather than what makes them dark in the first place.  So, in the long line of poor attempts, GRSOV ranks higher than Punisher: War Zone, Dolph Lundgren's Punisher and the original GR, but that's about it. I truly hope there isn't a third.",

I'm a huge fan of the work that Mark Neveldine andI honestly don't even know where to begin. After the brief snippet of footage that was screened at Comic Con 2011, I had a tremendous amount of faith in GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE. I'm a huge fan of the work that Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor did with the CRANK films, and I thought their unorthodox style would benefit the GHOST RIDER franchise and result in a sequel that far surpassed its predecessor. Yeah, not so much. This film is a colossal disaster from start to finish, featuring a script that seems unfinished, characters that are barely established, and one of the absolute worst performances in Nicolas Cage's career. After a stylish animation sequence that establishes the character's origin, we find Johnny Blaze living in the Balkans for reasons that are never quite explained (this will become a recurring theme for nearly every major plot point in the film). An alcoholic priest named Moreau (Idris Elba with an inconsistent French accent) shows up on his doorstep and offers to lift the Ghost Rider curse in exchange for Blaze rescuing a young boy named Danny (Fergus Riordan) from the same demonic entity that purchased Blaze's soul, an entity that is now called Roarke rather than Mephistopheles and is now played by Ciarin Hinds rather than Peter Fonda. Blaze jumps on his bike and takes off, showing up just as our incredibly boring and non-threatening bad guy Carrigan (Johnny Whitworth) catches up with Danny and his Gypsy mother (Violante Placido). The Ghost Rider emerges and begins to lay waste to Carrigan's henchmen, turning them into piles of ash and terrifying the bejesus out of everyone - except Carrigan, who takes him out with a grenade launcher and disappears with the kid. The rest of the film is essentially one drawn-out chase sequence, punctuated by conveniently placed dialogue scenes where our characters try (and fail) to explain exactly what the hell is going on, amounting to nothing more than speed bumps on the road to Blaze's next transformation into his flaming skeletal alter-ego. To level the playing field, Roarke grants Carrigan some demonic powers of his own, leaving him with pale skin, a bad hair-metal wig, and the EXACT SAME ABILITIES as the first film's (far more interesting) villain, resulting in confrontations that feel boring, recycle, and unimaginative - because they are. Cage's manic, frenzied portrayal of Blaze feels nothing like the character he created in the first film, resulting in plenty of absurd, laughable moments as he shifts the insanity into overdrive, particularly in an interrogation scene where the Ghost Rider is \"scraping at the DOOOOOOOR\"and Blaze is trying desperately to hold him back. This performance is certainly the highlight of the film - unfortunately, it's for all the wrong reasons. While the new design of the Ghost Rider looks fantastic, featuring a charred skull and a leather jacket that bubbles and melts from the heat, the character feels like something from a cartoon, head tilted quizzically to one side as he contemplates his victims or giggling to himself as he turns a piece of construction equipment into a flaming instrument of death. Oh, and he pisses fire, of course. I'll give Neveldine and Taylor all the credit in the world for the adventurous and innovative method of filmmaking they developed on the CRANK films, but this style doesn't work here. GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE is poorly written, poorly edited, and poorly acted, and accomplishes nothing except to showcase that Neveldine and Taylor obviously have no idea what makes the character work. Make no mistake, this is the BATMAN AND ROBIN of the GHOST RIDER franchise, and everyone involved in this mess should be ashamed of themselves. www.nerdrep.com",

I don't think that a soft reboot should ever include the main actor from the film that is being rebooted. It creates inconsistencies in the minds of the viewer that wouldn't be there if the actor had been replaced.There were certainly some serious inconsistencies in Ghost Riders powers. He is knocked out by a grenade launcher, but when he is shot by a stinger missile, which is obviously much more powerful, he shrugs it off completely.II think the actual appearance of Ghost Rider was pretty good, but in several fight sequences, he just kind of meanders around. I expected the Spirit of Vengeance to be brutal and he kind of played cat and mouse instead.There are also far too many unneeded, flat plot devices, such as Cage losing the spirit, only to regain it 10 minutes later, the evil or misguided tattooed priests, and the angel randomly regaining sanity(A plot point that could have been really good if it hadn't been essentially a throwaway line in the film).The quick synopsis is that this movie tried to fit too many plot points into the movie, and ended up developing none of them very well. I think this movie is far worse than the original Ghost Rider, and roughly equal with Punisher War Zone in the quality of a movie.",

By making this film, theyA few random thoughts about Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance... A single viewing makes it obvious why Marvel Enterprises would move forward with the sequel to a feature whose box office performance was underwhelming. By making this film, they are reminding us what a bad comic book movie is really like, thereby elevating the relative quality of their recent stretch of mediocre efforts and lowering the bar for Marvel's big summer twosome: The Avengers and The Amazing Spider-Man. Also, I know Nic Cage is in financial distress and has to film pretty much every screenplay with which he is presented, but doesn't the law of averages demand that somewhere along the way, if only by accident, he would stumble upon a good movie?\r In some circles, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance has been referred to as more of a \"reboot\" than a \"sequel,\" although I'm not aware of any reboots that have featured the same actor in the lead role. Admittedly, pretty much everyone else, both in front of the camera and behind the scenes, has been jettisoned, leaving minimal traces of the first Ghost Rider. The new directors, Neveldine & Taylor, are the Crank guys and the screenplay is credited to two TV writers (Scott M. Gimple & Seth Hoffman) and one of the men behind Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy (David S. Goyer, who at some point probably tried desperately to get his name removed). Columbia Pictures showed admirable restraint in not selling Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance as being \"from the writer of The Dark Knight,\" although that would have been technically accurate.\r A certain amount of cheese is acceptable, even desirable, in a movie such as this. Some of the most entertaining action/adventure movies layer it on like a pizza. In the case of Ghost Rider: Sprit of Vengeance, Neveldine & Taylor turn the \"campiness\" dial to 11 with as much limburger as they can gather, but they forget a key element - the \"action/adventure\" one. This is a boring movie. The over-the-top outlandishness can't disguise that the whole 95 minutes represent one big snooze-fest. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is essentially a mixture of nonsensical story elements, bad special effects, and endless exposition. People talk and talk and talk like they're stuck in a parody of a Dan Brown novel, and they simply won't shut up.\r For some reason, Cage seems trapped in movies about demons and devils: the first Ghost Rider, Season of the Witch, Drive Angry, and now this one. Neveldine & Taylor should have used Drive Angry as a template - it recognized what it was and never tried to be anything more. The chief problem with Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is that it never embraces its utter awfulness. As a result, it's impossible to enjoy on any level. It's a complete mess.\r For acting to be this bad in movie not directed by Michael Bay or George Lucas, it has to be intentional. Nicolas Cage cackles like a constipated chicken and Ciaran Hinds interprets Satan as a twisted imitation of Mr. Potter from It's a Wonderful Life with a bad case of pink eye. Violante Placido sounds like she's speaking English phonetically and Johnny Whitworth tries desperately to chew scenery with more gusto than Cage, but finds himself overmatched. Still, even though everyone seems on board in this attempt to earn an ensemble cast Razzie, it's less enjoyable than it should be - well, most of the time.\r I won't spend much time on the 3-D because what's the point? In the ever-growing collection of 3-D offerings, this is among the most ill-conceived of selections. It's not the worst 3-D I have seen (in fact, it avoids a lot of the most common 3-D sins), but it adds absolutely nothing except a $3 surcharge. I'm not going to recommend seeking out a 2-D version, however, since the only iteration of Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance worth exploring is one in 0-D.\r Comic book movies, no matter how disappointing, generally manage to deliver at least halfway competent action scenes, but that's not the case here. It could have something to do with the shoestring budget that makes Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance appear to have been shot using a maxed out credit card with a low limit.\r I'll admit to having laughed a few times during Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, although I have no idea if the things that caused me to chortle were intended to be funny or not. It's that kind of movie. Even if the whole thing was intended as a send-up of comic books, it doesn't work. Parodies should be engaging, not sleep-inducing. This is one of those production disasters that offers little to bad movie aficionados and less to those who want to experience a coherent narrative. Limburger cheese is often referred to as stinking like dirty feet and that's a kind way to describe the stench given off by this film.",

One of the most visually interesting movies I've ever seen. I liked it. 10/10What you should know about this film before going to see.1. The action never stops. It's a bit like Conan or Van Helsing, in that, but - here - there's also a story told to be and all the action is part of the story. If no permit is what makes movies like Conan or Van Helsing so disappointing.2. This film is visually interesting. When the camera points at a wall, the wall is interesting. When the camera focuses on a field in a street, there are interesting things to do with it. When the characters are standing around talking, they make a nice place. Always. And then there are the special effects. GR looks awesome. And then there's the question ... split screen options ... the animation ... Everything that appears, history, and - more or less - not used again.3. The story is simple, strong, and never stops. The story immediately establishes who is the villain, which is the bad guy wants, and why good stop. And that's all. If you can not go beyond the first five minutes, and are willing to accept that A, B and C are (and why they do what they do), then the rest is just fun to see them fight. And it's fun.4. It's great. As a big fan of the whole life of Ghost Rider, I love the comic book in 1970, I come to this film with certain expectations. Above all: genetic resources must be cold / rough / awesome / etc. And in this film ... that is. Sometimes the servants are standing around with their jaws hanging, wondering: \"What is ****? And that's what I expected to see.5. It's an action movie first. And a. Superhero / supernatural film, the second Remove the foolish things, and you have a level of a film to action B. Hero-with-one-last-Slick faces evil to save the innocent. Even with all that icing on top sexy, the film has a keen sense of what it really is. And all the best for him.6. Nicolas Cage is a pleasure. And it looks like he has fun. Cage scene and eats all the hits (with the exception of Idris Elba), off the screen. There are some scenes are a hoot. And you just want to see them again and again. It's fun. More: it's funny. Cheeky fun.Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is crazy. One of the most visually interesting movies I've ever seen. I liked it. 10/10watch here  www.momomesh.ch",

CRANK directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylorn attempt to inject the same high-energy aesthetic in to the GHOST RIDER reboot, with disastrous results. SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE comes off looking like an unscripted mess, almost as if it were shot as an amateur music video for some no-name rock group. Nicolas Cage is as awful as ever. Why even bother rebooting the series only to bring back the single worst element from the original film? SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE takes a darker approach to the material that falls more closely in line with the comics, sacrificing the kid-friendly attitude from before in lieu of the increased action and horror. Ghost Rider has received a major overhaul as well, his charred skull and blistering costume being the only welcomed changes to the character. When standing before his enemies or blazing down the highway on his hellish motorcycle, he is an awesome sight to see. The remaining effects are uneven at best, and take a dive during the ugly transformation sequences. With a pointless excuse for a plot is hard to ignore, GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE offers little more than the occasional eye-candy.",

The last Ghost Rider movie was boring, this one is twice as better! Although, the plot needed more focus, same with character development. However, the Ghost Rider himself was the star of the film! He's mean, crazy, and funny in a way. Should make another one, but as a reboot, 'cause Nicholas Cage could do better than this.",

It's not a life changing, mold-breaking piece of cinema by any means, but it's still good fun. I had my doubts after the catastrophe the first movie was, but I'm glad I used my afternoon to give this version a go. Who knew insane flaming skeletons in a leather jacket could be so hot?",

It now lives the spirit of Ghost Rider . Johnny comes monk Moreau ( Idris Elba ) who invites him to save the boy Danny ( Fergus Riordan ) who is the son of the devil that haunts Carrigan (Johnny Whitworth) hired by the devil. The Devil plans to use the body of Danny for that would plunge the earth into darkness.\r Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance incomprehensible is a continuation of the first Ghost Rider (2007) in fact almost everything but Cage is not associated with the first film . This film is sheer madness. Compared with the first part of this film seems great. Main problem of the film itself is a racer. Nicolas Cage does not like does not look as dark servants of the devil . Ghost rider darkest character Marvel comics Comics, and here there is no gloom . Also Cage during transformation in the rider constantly hamming it is only laughter .\r But here's the design of the rider has changed for the better of his skull and clothes look more realistic skull hardened by fire , charred clothing . Action scenes in the film does not quite bad, but the camera work is just awful . Almost not make out what the camera is shaking all the time .\r Scenario film look very silly. Very good screenwriter David C. Goyer known for his screenplay for the film Batman Begins and Blade not tried. The film is full of blunders that not only conflict with the first part , but also with themselves .\r The ending made ​​very stupid and lazy. In the end Carrigan dies and gontsik devil sends back to his home in hell. It animates and Danny becomes an angel . At the end of rider rides enveloped naked flame.\r Verdict\rOne of the five worst films of 2012 and the worst movie comics.\r0.5/10",
