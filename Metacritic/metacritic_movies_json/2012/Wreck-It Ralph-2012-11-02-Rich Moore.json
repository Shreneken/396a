    "summary": "Ralph is tired of being overshadowed by Fix-It Felix, the \"good guy\" star of their game who always gets to save the day. But after decades doing the same thing and seeing all the glory go to Felix, Ralph decides he's tired of playing the role of a bad guy. He takes matters into his own massive hands and sets off on a game-hopping journeyRalph is tired of being overshadowed by Fix-It Felix, the \"good guy\" star of their game who always gets to save the day. But after decades doing the same thing and seeing all the glory go to Felix, Ralph decides he's tired of playing the role of a bad guy. He takes matters into his own massive hands and sets off on a game-hopping journey across the arcade through every generation of video games to prove he's got what it takes to be a hero.  On his quest, he meets the tough-as-nails Sergeant Calhoun from the first-person action game Hero\u2019s Duty. But it\u2019s the feisty misfit Vanellope von Schweetz from the candy-coated cart racing game, Sugar Rush, whose world is threatened when Ralph accidentally unleashes a deadly enemy that threatens the entire arcade. Will Ralph realize his dream and save the day before it\u2019s too late? (Walt Disney Pictures)\u2026 Expand",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Manages to be touching as well as silly, thrilling and just a bit exhausting. The secret to its success is a genuine enthusiasm for the creative potential of games, a willingness to take them seriously without descending into nerdy pomposity. I am delighted to surrender my cynicism, at least until I've used up today's supply of quarters.",
        "The most inventive and entertaining family movie I've seen this year, packed with wickedly smart humor and joyful animation.",
        "It's a wildly exciting ride, the fastest-moving, most enthusiastically kinetic kids' action film since \"The Incredibles.\"",
        "With plenty to appeal to boys and girls, old and young, Walt Disney Animation Studios has a high-scoring hit on its hands in this brilliantly conceived, gorgeously executed toon, earning bonus points for backing nostalgia with genuine emotion.",
        "The movie's subversive sensibility and old-school/new-school feel are a total kick.",
        "Replace the toy box with the arcade machine, and Wreck-It Ralph is basically a repurposed \"Toy Story\" movie, suffused with the same mix of adventure and nostalgia and themes of friendship and the existential crises that come with age. A cynic might dismiss the film as reheated leftovers. But that cynic would be wrong, because those leftovers are delicious.",
        "Consider it a force in the Best Animated Film Oscar race.",
        "With a mix of retro eye-candy for grown-ups and a thrilling, approachable storyline for the tykes, the film casts a wide and beguiling net.",
        "With Halloween bags still brimming, it's an ideal time for the inventive candy-colored fun and wicked humor that is Wreck-It Ralph.",
        "The world of Sugar Rush itself merits some mention, too. Deliriously inventive and pulsing with life, it almost seems a shame a real video game wasn\u2019t developed from its blueprints; it\u2019s a world in which one wants to linger.",
        "There are more videogame cameos and winks than you can shake a Wiimote at - even the Konami Code, the gamer's paternoster, makes an appearance - but the real success of the film is its emotional core and the relationship between the two misfits.",
        "The movie's first half is its funniest, as Moore sets up this alternate low-resolution universe.",
        "Beneath the pixelated gags, the stakes are relatively familiar. However, much of the humor in Wreck-It Ralph riffs on the nostalgia associated with real games.",
        "A \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" for the joystick generation that, despite a mid-act dip into generic Disney territory, high-scores on laughs, invention and 8-bit affection.",
        "A Disney flick that feels like on-form Pixar, blending knowing humour and sophistication with a large helping of heart. You'll want another go.",
        "The metaphor is clever, injecting real-life risk and reward into these beautifully artificial vistas, scored to composer Henry Jackman's Nintendo-worthy beeps and bloops.",
        "Twice now Reilly and Silverman have helped to give a cartoon\u2019s happy ending real emotional depth. And twice now, they\u2019ve made their characters so endearing that some fans may feel oddly conflicted about the prospect of undoing those endings just to see them again.",
        "It's impossible not to feel a strong sense of nostalgic amusement, if not sheer delight, at the comings and goings of all these characters.",
        "Colorful, noisy, and pixel-deep.",
        "A lot like video games and candy: light entertainment but fun while it lasts.",
        "If you're a gamer, another level of humor opens up, as a variety of characters make surprise appearances throughout the film.",
        "Moore brings a video junkie's passion to the movie game, and it's hilariously infectious.",
        "Wreck-It-Ralph is a gorgeously rendered story that will play just as well to children as to their parents, albeit for different reasons. Playstation and Xbox junkies will be equally pleased.",
        "There's something very old fashioned about the core ingredients of Wreck-It Ralph; these blend well with the \"hip\" elements. Still, I can't help but wonder whether this is all just one big product placement for something aimed at the home video market. It seems like a game designer's wet dream.",
        "More than in most animated films, the art design and color palette of Wreck-It Ralph permit unlimited sets, costumes and rules, giving the movie tireless originality and different behavior in every different cyber word.",
        "Visually dazzling, intermittently funny.",
        "I found the first 30 minutes of Wreck-It Ralph a lot of fun, the second and third 30 minutes progressively more routine.",
        "Still, it does eventually become a bit tedious, and for all the breathless kineticism of the film's second act, you may find yourself twiddling your thumbs. It's a cool game, to be sure, but watching someone else play it gets old after a while.",
        "John C. Reilly provides the voice of Ralph, and he's every bit as good as you'd expect in the role. It's Sarah Silverman, however, as his unlikely sidekick, and rescue subject,  whose considerable charm threatens to steal the show.",
        "Emphasizes action and eye-popping visuals over emotion.",
        "It's a lovely pretext for dazzling visuals, yet the production is diminished by the clumsiness of an 8-bit script.",
        "It's pure plastic product from plot line to the pro forma 3-D to the tidy moral lessons - ersatz family entertainment as disposable as it is diverting. It made me want to go read a book.",
        "As with its narrative, Wreck-It Ralph's themes don't develop by branching out in wild, unpredictable ways; instead, they simply become narrower and more monotonous.",
        "Yes, the idea is unique. But they aren't quite ready to shake off what has worked for them for years -- namely making girls want to be special and popular, and boys strong and heroic.",
        "For me, it never came to life.",
        "Sweet enough but in the end a bit of a corny-syrupy wipeout, this is middling family-night fare, but it never even comes close to the emotional or technical wizardry of Pixar's finest moments.",
        "Nothing but broad, pandering indexes tailored to appeal to the arcade wistfulness the film never even bothers to convincingly evoke."

The very opening scene blows you away when you go from 2D view of the Fix it Felix Jr. game into the 3D immersive world.

This movie takes my two favorite things, and throws them into one.  Now the question is: does it work?  The answer is an absolute YES!!!  In fact, this movie is so good, that it is now one of my favorite movies of all time!  It is funny, has memorable characters, great animation, and the most original setting in the history of cinema.  I really have very little to complain about in this movie.  Okay, so there might be one or two little things.  For one, there are several video game characters that I wanted to see in this movie, but weren't there (seriously, Disney shows no love to Mario, Link, Samus or any other heroic Nintendo character).  Yes they did mention Mario at one point, but that doesn't count.  Also, I found the plot to be a little bit unoriginal, and predictable.  A super villain who wants to be good?  I'm pretty sure that's been done before.  It also follows a pattern that I like to call the classic Disney film plot.  In other words, if you have seen any other Disney movie, you can probably guess what this movie's plot is like.  Despite this, the original setting makes you completely forget about the plot.  This really is an excellent movie, and is totally worth watching if you love animation, movies, video games, an original setting, or just want a movie that has quite an adventurous feel behind it.",

Thanks to some nifty world-building, I fell in love with the video game universe and got nostalgic when watching the video game action scenes, especially those set in Sugar Rush. Sarah Silverman's vocal performance as Vanellope von Schweetz stands as one of the movie's greatest highlights, and the animation and 3D are enticing and colourful. The script and characters are just as smart as some of Pixar's greatest movies, and had they released Wreck-it-Ralph instead of Brave last year, I would've gone as far to say that they made a full recovery from Cars 2. They didn't unfortunately, but Wreck-it-Ralph still emerges as the Toy Story of a new generation and I'd love to see how it'll play out as a franchise.",

After seeing this film, I can say that it had all of that and more. Having 'Sonic the Hedgehog' appear more than three times in a movie already makes it awesome for me and there's plenty of fan service for everyone else too, ranging from 'Super Street Fighter' to 'Pacman'. There's just so much attention to detail, from the way some characters movements have an extremely low frame-rate like in some retro video-game, to a scene where Ralph pulls out of a sink a 'Super Mario' mushroom, an exlamation mark from 'Metal Gear Solid' and Zangief of 'Super Street-Fighter's unerwear. There are so many other scenes and aspects to the movie that have so much attention in the detail more so than any other movie that revolves around video games would, so I won't spoil it for you by saying any more about this (Besides, if I told you about every detail and reference to real video games in this movie, you'd be reading this for hours, anyway.) So they've definetely got the video-games side of this movie right, but what about the plot. Well, I know a bad guy who is looking to be good to be \"wreck-ognized\" isn't exactly the most original plot. While I haven't seen any movies that have actually used this plot before, I am sure it has been done and it also feels like the typical type of Disney plot. But to be honest, this did not disappoint me. You may think that this is because the video-game elements would distract you from the not-so-original plot, but I have to say, that isn't all. The reason the plot didn't bother me is because it was interpreted so well. Of course an animated movie revolving around video-games is quite a new thing, so this does not feel old. But the plot is just done so well at the same time. I cannot explain exactly how it does it, all I can really say is that you should definetely consider seeing it. If you play video games, don't even consider it. Just see it without question. And if you don't play video-games, the storyline is enough to make this movie worth seeing. I would give this a 9/10, but Metacritic only allow whole numbers, so I'll give it a 10. But to be honest, I have no problem giving it a 10. See it.",

It failed to have the emotional weight of the second film in the toy story franchise, or that one with the fish that proves you can be affected by the digital image.  There was more feeling in the opening 2D short than there was in this entire movie.  Probably worth the entrance fee for that alone.  Schweet.",

But, the movie was also very much for adults since the language wasn't totally geared towards tweens which made it even more enjoyable and took away any feeling that I was too old to watch it.

I loved the very cool idea of video game characters in an arcade that had homes they went back to after their \"work day\" in the arcade game was over. It is jam packed with references to old school arcade games and being 40 I remember playing Q-bert and Pac-man etc. in the arcade. I like how it fused a character from a more modern game into the plot which was centered on an older 8-bit game. A large part of it takes place in a game called 'Sugar Rush' which was cute and funny but a little too cutsie for me. It seemed to be aimed more at kids than adults, which is a no-brainer but many movies like this have a ton of jokes for adults too and some of the retro game stuff was but it was just very cutsie. The script was good with decently fleshed out main characters and overall it was a good amount of laughs and entertainment.",

I admit that I was way off. After seeing this movie four times, I can say that I still laugh and enjoy the film.\r Our main character is Ralph (John C. Reilly) who belongs in the arcade game Wreck It Ralph. Ralph's home is moved and replaced by a complex full of people knows as \"NiceLanders.\" Ralph upset by this wrecks the building and it is fixed by Felix (Jack McBrayer.) That is the game that the arcade users play.\r On the games anniversary, Ralph is not invited and wrecks the building for real this time because all he wants is a medal and to be a good guy for once. He decides to leave his own game and try to win a medal in others. He meets Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch) in one game (Heroes Duty) and takes accidently flies a space pod into a candy racing game, (Sugar Rush) where he meets a girl named Vanellope von Schweetz. (Sarah Silverman)\r We first meet Vanellope when she takes Ralph's medal. Throughout the movie we see her character evolve into a better person. Ralph starts to show emotion toward Vanellope which we can clearly see especially when Ralph teaches her how to drive a racecar. Vanellope usually gets picked on because she is called a glitch. She isn't allowed to race because if she crosses the finish line the entire game resets so she used Ralph's medal to enter the race. The movie takes a very unexpected turn and has a powerful ending.\r I loved Wreck It Ralph enough to see it multiple times with friends and independently and have had great reactions from friends who watched it.

It has the charm and great characters of a Pixar movie, coupled with some great humor that seems to take inspiration from Dreamworks Animation. At first, the title character Ralph seems mean-spirited, but he later turns out to be a great hero. Older viewers will recognize the games shown and feel the nostalgia, and younger viewers will appreciate the colorful animation. But what older and younger viewers can agree on is that Wreck-it Ralph's storytelling and emotion is top notch.",

It treats the story of Ralph the villain of a video game, who does not like his job, but he must do it because is what he has to do. The interesting thing is that we visualize to worlds, one in the arcade were lots of children go to play, and other one inside the video games were all the characters live; it is remarkable that they can go from one game to another using the Game Central Station. The plot starts when the protagonist leaves his game. In this point starts the searching of Ralph for his own purpose in life aka his destiny, that is why he not only will go through different games, but also through his soul, in order to find who he really is. Because of this Ralph quotes the villains oath: I am bad, and that is good. I will never be good, and that is not bad. I will always be me.\rIn addition we notice that the concept of evil in the occidental mentality is broken, because it is no longer something bad, now it is a vital part of any situation; without evil, good means nothing.\rWith awesome characters construction, great dialogues and non-disappointing animation, this is a movie for people who when they were children suffer bullying, were alone, have no friends or family; or that now are lost in life.",

Honestly it's impressive to see an animated movie this good come from Disney and it not have Pixar's name attached to it. The characters and story are charming, the animation is superb, and the voice acting is excellent. The movie may be about the title character, but it's Sarah Silverman's \"Vanellope\" that ends up stealing the show.\r Kids are going to love this for it's characters, humor, and all around kid friendliness. However adults will love it for the exact same reason, and for it's numerous video game references. Honestly this is an excellent movie for gamers of all ages. It provides an excellent look at the interactive form of entertainment so many of us love. There are also numerous references to popular video games hidden throughout the film, some more subtle than others. This film pleased both the gamer and the movie fan within me.\r \"Wreck-It-Ralph\" is a real treat, and just like the best Pixar movies both kids and adults will love every second of this film. A perfect movie for parents to watch with their kids. Heck it's good enough that parents don't even need their kids to watch this. This is a must watch for gamers alone just for the references hidden throughout. It's nice to see a film that portrays video games, not just as  a worthless waste of time, but as a form of entertainment that is filled with characters and stories we can all love. Needless to say I highly recommend this movie.",

Video games are so popular it's amazing that nobody has made a film like this before. Everything starts off well, the graphics and animations are outstanding and there's a great mix of different styles from different eras (8-bit, 16-bit, etc, with appropriate animations  the nicelander people are particularly well done).  Everything is introduced well and the first half an hour is a brilliant exercise in spotting the video game cameos. For someone who's been interested in games for a while I loved the more obscure references such as the metal gear exclamation mark.\r However once we get to the sugar rush land things start to go a bit wrong. Vanellope starts off cute and the voice work by Sarah Silverman is very good, but unfortunately the character becomes quite irritating with all the breathless rushing around. We also have another story arc going on in the background with Felix and Calhoun but this is quite boring. What the film lacks is a strong comedy sidekick like the donkey in Shrek. I also feel that the film spends too long in Sugar Rush  after a while you get bored of\rall the chocolate lakes and candy canes and wish they'd take the story to another game for a while. The story is also quite predictable and I was surprised to find myself getting quite bored long before the end. It's a shame because I felt they could have done so much more with the video game premise  the entire section in sugar rush who have easily been set in Alice in Wonderland, for example, given the look of the environment and characters.\r Overall the film is a mixture of Toy Story and Monsters Inc but isn't as good as either.",

While it's not the best movie to use video games as a subject, it does well in incorporating references and nostalgic tidbits of games both new and old. My only complaint is the way the movie was advertised. Trailers, sneak-peeks and even cast interviews claim that Wreck-It Ralph is about a character who \"jumps\" between a number of different video games. Yes, it was there, but he only went to three: his own, a Halo-like shooter, and a Candy Land-esque racing game where the majority of the film takes place. This is quite upsetting, due to the fact that I, like many others, expected Ralph to \"jump\" to many different games.  I don't think this movie was as good as it should of been. The first third of the film is surprisingly fun, refreshing and exciting. But it starts to slow down, and things seem to just stop. The video game references stop, the excitement isn't there, and good ole' Disney magic kicks in with a generic plot and the same generic problems we've seen over and over. To sum it all up, Wreck-It Ralph is 1/2 video game referencing fun, and 1/2 a Disney movie. If ANYONE else made Wreck-It Ralph, it could have been a blast. But, Disney's kid-oriented restrictions kept a lot of fun at bay. I'm disappointed that this wasn't what it could have been, but, it's still a good movie.",

I was also a little disappointed that Ralph didn't visit more games.  The previews made it look like he was a rogue character that escaped from his game and went to others, but he only visited two other games and most of the movie took place in the Candy game.  That's where the movie got a little too routine for me.  Still, it was entertaining enough to give it a pass.  Not one of Disney's best movies, and certainly not in the league of \"Tangled\".",

But even as a family animated movie Wreck-It Ralph hits all the right notes, once again Pixar do what they do so well and craft brilliant characters, colourful exciting worlds and an entertaining story. In short Ralph is the bad guy in a classic arcade game called \"Fix It Felix Jr\", tired of being the bad guy he leaves the game and ventures into other games in an effort to become a hero. Saying anymore will spoil the plot and Pixar films are ones that are best gone into afresh. The pacing does falter a bit in them middle but the beginning and ending is pure goodness, by the end you'll want to play even the fictional games made for the movie.",

Ralph doesn't like being a bad guy because bad guys dont win medals or get celebrated so when he is shunned from the games 30th anniversary party Ralph decides to leave his game, join a different one and win a medal for being a good guy. However in his disappearance the game Fix-It Felix is continued to be played and is reported broken due to a missing Ralph. Felix realises how much of a role Ralph plays and must track him down and get him back in the game before they are unplugged forever.\r Wreck-It Ralph is incredibly well animated, has a brilliant voice cast and some great cameo's of real game characters and their voice actors. Gamers and non-gamers alike will enjoy it for its modern take on the 'Toy Story' tale and for its hilarious references, the most notable being the Konami Code.\rWreck-It Ralph is this generations Toy Story and a film that should not be missed by anyone of any age.",

The film is also helped by great vocal talent. Everyone fits their role and help elevate the movie above the likes of rise of the guardians. However the film suffers on two fronts  a bare bones plot device and a villain who only really gets revealed near the end. A bit more world building would have helped both. But still, this is a quality animated movie and great fun for video game nerds like myself. The end credits in particular are lovely. Just below a 7 here. If Metacritic allowed decimals, this would be a 6.5.\r Special mention for the Disney short at the start  Paperman.

It's just an idea that came from a writer's head and sold it to whatever studio is willing to accept it.\r The movie focuses on a typical bad guy from a popular \"Fix-It Felix Jr.\" video game named Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) whose depression gets the better of him since the game is about to reach its 30th anniversary and he feels unpopular and unloved.\r Whenever the arcade closes, the video game characters go on to their daily lives of going to bars, or just hanging out at another game program.\r Can't blame him, when was the last time you played \"Super Mario\" and thought maybe you should give Bowser a break? Why would you? He keeps kidnapping the Princess.\r Ralph decides that enough is enough and must earn everybody's respect the same way that the ever so popular Felix Jr. (Jack McBrayer) has earned everybody's respect. In order for Ralph to prove himself, he needs to win a medal and it is there that he will get what he desires.\r He tries to do this by \"game-hopping\", in other words, one video game character entering a different video game, kind of like seeing Sonic the Hedgehog appear out of nowhere in the game \"Luigi's Mansion\". Ralph enters a game called \"Hero's Duty\", a homage to the ever so popular \"Call of Duty\". He meets a very ballsy female action hero called Sargent Calhoun (Jane Lynch), who is a very funny character as she takes no nonsense and has more guts than most men, including Ralph.\r Ralph manages to receive the medal, but accidentally takes a ship and a harmful \"Hero's Duty\" bug into another game called \"Sugar Rush\" which combines the visual aspect of \"Candy Crush\" and the gameplay style of \"Mario Kart\". He meets a young girl named Vanellope Von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) who takes his medal and uses it to enter the race that she cannot be a part of.\r We also meet a mysterious leader named King Candy (Alan Tudyk), who does not want Vanellope to compete in the game and tries to stop Ralph from letting her do so.\r The funniest parts in the movie include the surprising romance between Fix-It Felix Jr. and Sargent Calhoun, the way the writers pull that off with intentional cliches, but genuine chemistry is very well done.\r 'Wreck-It Ralph' is a highly entertaining and colorful movie and one of the best movies of 2012. It shares the same spirit as the \"Toy Story\" films, maybe that's because it is executive produced by John Lasseter who never falls short of great imagination, and considering that it's made by Walt Disney Animation Studios instead of Pixar Animation Studios (which had 'Brave' that felt more Disney), it's understandable to get the two confused.\r Great cast, great humor, great animation and a great story. 10/10.",

The movie starts great, it seamlessly introduces the concept in a very easy and interesting format.

There's just something special about seeing characters you know and love on the big screen. The problem is that it eventually stops. The movie starts venturing into its own territory and it never looks back. For one, I am glad the movie doesn't just rely on cameos to win people over, but when there are so many possibilities and so many chances it is also hard to conceive that after 20 minutes or so of the movie; Ralph stays the rest of the film in only one video-game space, Sugar Rush. I expected, and I think everybody expected that Ralph would have taken the opportunity into wider conceptions. That out of the way, there's no deny that the movie has heart, and a lot of it. The chemistry between Ralph and Vanellope is unquestionable and makes for a very understandable and unique couple of characters.

This simple fact meant I wasn't looking forward to Wreck it Ralph at all. The film follows Wreck it Ralph (John C Reilly), the main villain in the game Fix it Felix Jr, a game where Ralph feels nothing but under appreciated. Because of this he decides to game jump and in search of more pixilated pastures. This brings hum to a game called Sugar Rush where he meets Penelope (Sarah Silverman), a young girl with problems that he decides to help due to their similarities. Meanwhile Felix searches for Ralph to get him to return to the game so it doesn't get unplugged for good. The film cleverly creates a world of games instead of concentrating on just one. This is how Wreck it Ralph manages to avoid the curse of the video game adaptation. It manages to be original while referencing old games in passing. The film acts as an homage, not just to retro games but the culture of gaming in general making for a very moving and culturally relevant film that will resonate with kids, adults and even the more hardcore gamers. It's story is well constructed as it establishes a world with endless franchise possibilities but it also creates a genuine conflict and risk for these characters making their journey throughout the film quite tense at times. The adventures they go on are dangerous and because of this they are thrilling. The film does drag in its opening 30 minutes but so did the first Toy Story, its a film creating a world from scratch and ultimately you have to give it the time to do so. The film however does lack a decent villain with its ending suffering in some ways because of it but as a problem it is only a subtle one. The film engages with the viewer through Ralph, who is a thoroughly empathetic lead and incredibly entertaining in both his clumsiness and his heart. The father daughter relationship between him and Penelope is the heart and soul of the picture and makes for an emotional finale even though there is no real tense climax. Ultimately its a film that works because of how clever it is and how good a lead character Ralph is. John C Reilly is a dynamic lead and gives Ralph an everyman kind of quality that makes it easy to like him. It's a Disney film with the heart and power of a Pixar movie and after 2010's Tangled it bodes well for Disney animations in general.",
