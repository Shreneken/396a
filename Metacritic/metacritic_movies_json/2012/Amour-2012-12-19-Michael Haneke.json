  "critic_reviews": [
    "If we were previously in any doubt, Haneke is confirmed as the premiere European director of his generation.",
    "With Amour, it's the rare feeling of watching a masterpiece unfold.",
    "The story is so masterfully told that one can't help but be enthralled.",
    "Amour arrives with plaudits and praise. But this is not hype, it is all deserved. This is a masterpiece.",
    "This is the sort of small, intimate drama about unpleasant subject matter Hollywood rarely deals with, but Haneke isn't worried about turning off his audience, because death is something everyone has in common. It fascinates us, the way it also scares us.",
    "What happens between two people? Only the chemistry that keeps us from stumbling through the chaos by ourselves. Is that an illusion, too? Amour says it doesn't much matter. There is no dignity in life except love.",
    "More arduously, Riva is obliged to act out the physical decline while still registering a full spectrum of emotions. Remarkably, she does it all, even when reduced to communicating with her eyes alone. Hers is, in every sense of the phrase, a nakedly honest performance.",
    "Amour is a must-see film that not everyone must see, at least right now.",
    "Small, sure and stunningly acted, this is a picture of exacting control.",
    "An unexpected kind of masterpiece by Haneke, whose films have included the enigmatic \"Caché\" and the earlier Golden Palm winner \"The White Ribbon.\" We don't expect such unflinching seriousness, such profundity from Haneke.",
    "In Amour, these two actors show us what love is, what it really looks like, and what it may, at its most secret moments, demand.",
    "What makes Amour so strong and clear is that it allows Haneke to anatomize his own severity.",
    "In the quietly devastating Amour, Haneke's cool, dispassionate gaze feels, for the first time, something like love.",
    "This is an unforgettable love story set at the close of day, as tragic and beautiful in its way as \"Tristan und Isolde,\" and a portrait of the impossible beauty and fragility of life that will yield new experiences to every viewer and every viewing.",
    "Michael Haneke's French-language Amour, a perfect film about intertwined lives, proceeds at its own pace, and breathes so deeply that it takes your own breath away.",
    "At his provocative best, though - in his brilliant, gorgeous 2009 film \"The White Ribbon,\" a study of the roots of fascism in domestic tyranny, and now in Amour - Haneke implicates us in the full range of human capacity.",
    "All great films have imagination; this one also has the sense of experience.",
    "Magnificent in its simplicity and its relentless honesty about old age, illness and dying, Michael Haneke's Amour is a deliberately torturous watch.",
    "In the history of movies about love, Amour shall last forever.",
    "A director known for the icy classicism and genre subversion of films like \"Funny Games\" and \"Caché,\" Haneke has a pitilessness that could not be more perfect for Amour, which would collapse at any whiff of sentimentality.",
    "A masterpiece about life, death and everything in between.",
    "Small victories that turn into defeats, long walks to gain little ground, little wounds that get deeper every day - growing old is a war, and movies rarely go there. Michael Haneke's amazing, dignified Amour is the exception.",
    "Something sacred passes between Trintignant and Riva. The actress's eyes signal deep awareness as the sounds coming out of her mouth become animalistic.",
    "A perfect storm of a motion picture, with an icy, immaculate director unexpectedly taking on deeply emotional subject matter.",
    "Don't let Amour join the legion of \"Best Films You Never Saw.\" I urge you to share its sweetness and wisdom, and learn something.",
    "The icy message may be that love is not a consolation as we face death. Rather the reverse. Love will give your death meaning, but make it no less unbearable.",
    "Michael Haneke's Palme D'Or winner is uncomfortable, uncompromising, unflinching... and utterly unmissable. Old age may not be a reality you wish to confront, but you must see this film.",
    "A compassionate, masterful work that deservedly won Haneke a second Palme d'Or after \"The White Ribbon's\" 2009 victory. Best to avoid on a first date, though.",
    "Considering Haneke's confrontational past, this poignantly acted, uncommonly tender two-hander makes a doubly powerful statement about man's capacity for dignity and sensitivity when confronted with the inevitable cruelty of nature.",
    "While what's on screen is unsparing and clinically presented, the underlying, almost invisible humanity and artistry of the film inspire rather than depress.",
    "Although not exactly heartwarming, Amour has a more contained vision of human relationships than Haneke's previous films without sacrificing its bleak foundation. It's his most conventional movie about death -- and the most poignant.",
    "Riva, meanwhile, is astounding, not just in the way she portrays the physical manifestation of her decline, particularly later in the film, but also earlier, when she knows she is fading and does not wish to do so. The look in her eyes, the sadness in her face, is crushing.",
    "Love means being helpmates throughout all of life's stages. Death is part of love's bargain, and Haneke lays this fact bare.",
    "The superb Trintignant and the Oscar-nominated Riva – who would win, in a just world – embody once-vigorous people in inevitable decline. Yet as another critic has said, the film is sad without being depressing.",
    "This may sound depressing and, in a sense it is, but these things are part of life and Haneke conveys them with a simplicity that is heartbreaking.",
    "These two glam stars of French cinema – Riva in 1959's \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" and Trintignant in 1966's \"A Man and a Woman\" – give performances of breathtaking power and beauty. Prepare for an emotional wipeout.",
    "Amour is nevertheless the work of a filmmaker who isn't afraid to ask the big questions about human nature, and coming out of Amour it seems the director has hope for us yet.",
    "Amour is a far cry from the warm-and-fuzzy version of love that most people are probably looking for on Valentine's Day. This movie is more of a slap than a hug. But reality hurts sometimes - just like love does.",
    "Audiences smart and tough enough to seek the film out will have their own reward.",
    "It's not an easy sit; we're never let off the hook with golden-hued memories or belated bits of wisdom. Maybe this is love after all.",
    "Amour is also unforgettable and one of a kind, two hours of torment that, in the end, you will probably not regret.",
    "For all that it is, as promised, about love, it's also a subtly punishing affair that grinds you into the ground as you watch an elderly couple deal with one member's slow deterioration of health and sanity.",
    "Because of its subject matter, and because of the actors, it's impossible to watch this film without being moved. But a martinet is running the show.",
    "Haneke remains, by his rules, infallible. So what? A movie in which incident is as spare as it is in Amour can certainly be great; a movie in which ideas and feelings are so sparse cannot.",
    "This isn't the work of a newly moral or humanistic filmmaker, but another ruse by the same unscrupulous showman whose funny games have been beguiling us for years."

It is very touching and also rough, because it is noticeable the point that true love can reach. The movie portrayed an old woman with hemiplegia cause by a vascular accident with progressive decrease of brain activity and the future of the marriage will fall to her husband. What this picture is doing, is trying to figure out what is love, using apart from the plot, the script, the cameras and the performances. That is why the movie is so slow, with static camera movements and with people that evaluate what they are doing, because you cannot rush love, it is about patience and understanding. Everything in the film is well prepared, Michael Haneke definitely did an excellent job in directing and the protagonist couple is just brilliant, but I think is more Jean-Louis Trintignant than Emmanuelle Riva.",

In a way it feels necessary, focusing with unflinching precision on an aspect of love and relationships that is usually overlooked (and certainly not by accident). The problem is, as the title suggests, this is a film about a phenomenon, a philosophical concept, but not about people. The two characters do have names, but for all intents and purposes they are just Old Person 1 and Old Person 2, and as the camera's gaze bounces off their impeccably shot faces and rests on shelves full of old, dusty books, it becomes apparent that this isn't really a drama, but more of an essay, and instead of a punch in the gut it delivers a long, stern lecture. You should absolutely see it if you haven't already, but that's the central problem with Amour: it's the kind of film that you watch because it's important, not because it's good.",

The film is basically a genteel “infomercial” that argues the case for  euthanasia; it's an highly aggressive, in-your-face exercise and a very ONE-NOTE, highly aggressive, in-your-face exercise..........What it also has “going for it”  in some circles at any rate- is the Jerry Springer-like touch of casting two well known stars of yesteryear, now in their 80s, in the lead roles. This brings an eerie Reality TV touch to the proceedings and something of a “frisson nouveau” to your card-carrying film buff audience (the demographic-massaging angle) Think how much, by way of  comparison, the casting two relative unknowns would have affected the film’s reception...... In Teen Speak it would have been …..“B-O-R-R-R-I-N-G !!!”\r Jean-Louis Trintignant in particular struggles to breath life into the sparse characterization that writer/director Haneke has provided for  him. However his efforts are in vain, for the forces of “infomercial-hood” are aligned against him here and (even more artistically crippling) Haneke’s somewhat gleeful penchant for the morbid. This latter  holds sway as his camera zooms in to capture every detail of the physical and mental disintegration of Trintignant‘s wife (the now 85-year-old star of \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\"  Emmanuelle Riva.) Indeed, Riva’s character soon becomes a sort of laboratory specimen that Haneke is studying intently under the microscope  “I wonder what will “go” next  he seems to be asking himself, pencil in hand   with the result that The Wife (which is the sort of generic entity that Riva is finally reduced to) ends up becoming disconcertingly like that giant bug that Gregor Samsa turns into in Kafka’s \"The Metamorphosis\"   By contrast, one wonders what Jean Renoir or Douglas Sirk would have done with  this material. The fact that Riva’s character is not particularly sympathetic to begin with only adds to the uneasiness- indeed, queasiness- we end up experiencing as we’re invited to observe the spectacle of her relentless undoing....... Sad to say, by that point in the film either this latter studying-the-bug-under-the-microscope sensation or else flat out boredom seem to be our only options. \"Amour\" is an award-winning and highly pretentious film and the two go together much too often for comfort these days.",

In “Amour”, the movie they costar in, they are not actors creating roles but real people you believe in, understand, feel for and identify with, no matter your age.\r “Amour” is a mass of contradictions showing all sides of life and love and that neither life or love, or both, mean ‘happily ever after’. The film is a depressing one but, at the same time, shows you how two people can love each other without saying the words. We know how the movie will end because it starts with the police breaking into an apartment and finding Anne, (Emmanuelle Riva)  dead in bed surrounded by flowers. After that the title is announced, the credits start and the next scene shows Anne and Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant), retired music teachers, at a concert given by a former student and then the following morning, when, at the breakfast table, she starts staring off into space and suffers a stroke caused by a blocked carotid artery .\r The screenplay by Michael Haneke, who also directed, tells the story from the male point of view when half of a devoted team becomes a caretaker and watches the partner he has loved for so long deteriorate. At first he tries to handle it alone but it becomes too much and he hires two nurses but finds one treating his wife like a baby and taking away her dignity so with much rage showing in his eyes and controlled voice he tells her to get out. Their daughter Eva (Isabelle Huppert) lives overseas, very much involved with tensions between her and her husband, and has drifted from her parents though she remembers walking in on them when she was young and they were having sex, making love and enjoying it closing out the rest of the world, including her.\r Watching Riva and Trintignant expressing love with touches, looks, smiles and memories makes you forget you are watching a movie with actors being told where to stand and what to say. You feel you are looking into a world very few couples ever experience and the consequences of life no matter how much you love someone.\r “Amour” is a very slow moving movie but every moment counts and you get so caught up with the couple there are two points that you will involuntarily gasp as the whole audience does and when the movie ends you want it to go on. The ending caused many controversies between moviegoers as they walked out of the auditorium.\r This is a special love story showing what can happen at the end rather than at the beginning of mating for life, for ‘better or worse’.\r A MUST SEE MOVIE--HOPEFULLY WILL WIN OSCAR FOR BEST FOREIGN MOVIE!",

I REALLY DISLIKED the way it ended/began and think it undermined the integrity of the film. It was uncharacteristically sentimental. My guess is this was done to give the wider audience a slightly nicer-than-bleak tone? Why else would the director want us to believe that after he (presumably) kills himself (what on earth happens to his body???) the couple are re-united in the \"afterlife\". Hmmm. Sweet, but irrelevant to the story and superstitious speculation at best. The missing body, or the fact it was not alluded to at the start of the movie when her body is found, seems like an unnecessary and contrived ploy \"to make us wonder\", debate the ending etc... In this way it is contrived, perhaps a marketing department idea to create a \"hook\" for cinema goers to debate and therefore promote the movie. This missing body anomaly, and the fact that we are given the \"feel good\" token at the end seems entirely inconsistent with the rest of the movie - which is so beautifully real.

The movie is extremely overrated and I suspect it has to do with the \"artsy pseudo-intellectual niche\". The acting is very solid and the style frames the pic as something that looks like a solid, profound drama. This frame is but a frame though. If you stop to think what this movie is really about you will see that the style is pure style, which makes the movie really shallow and superficial and the good acting a waste of talent.\rThe thing is, this is one of those movies that has no reason to exists, cause it shows nothing special, it inspires nothing, it adds nothing to the table. The movie is a long arrangement of scenes that do not differ a lot from what you'll see if you pay more attention to your grandparents or to the old couple that lives in the same neighborhood as you. Maybe to some extent the intention of the movie was to develop awareness of the limits of life... but it attempts so in such a boring, slow approach and it really does not work. If you don't like seeing old people doing their routines, the movie will be boring. If you appreciate the respect people of age deserve, don't praise this movie, stop being lazy and get off your couch and go interact with you grandma or grandpa",

Sure, Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva give some of the best performances of the decade, and certainly, their supporting cast is wonderful, but the film’s atmosphere, looming shots, and thematic concepts surpass this. Haneke’s distinct style can run amok within Amour, heavily delving into euthanasia and suicide in general. Amour explores the same elements of suicide that Happy End does, the only differences being the pieces it uses to do so. Haneke’s previous works bleed into this, with remnants of Time of the Wolf, Funny Games, and Code Unknown all present and these influences are appreciated and well placed. Amour may be periodically obscure and potentially tiringly slow, but Amour is deeply beautiful and touching in many ways.",

We toss it out recklessly, professing our love for sandwiches and video games. Amour does not shy away from the ugliness of love, as we often do, and instead embraces everything that encompasses a fulfilling, long-lasting relationship. It can be difficult to watch, because it presents its plot with subtlety and shies away from sentimentality. This approach may be challenging for some viewers, and unaffecting to some, but there is a poetic quality to this work that it may be impossible to not appreciate it.\r The plot revolves around a musical elderly couple that must face the inevitability of death. Amour's brutal honesty about the subject is portrayed brilliantly by its two leads, both of who deserve award recognition for their work. Their relationship always remains strong throughout this endeavor, although they share different views of how this should play out. You can hardly blame them when they maltreat each other, since the situation is bound to evoke this sort of result. While the rest of the movie is quiet and meditative, the ending in particular brings such a bittersweet warmth through its ambiguity and artistic sensibilities that I was genuinely brought to tears. The film will stay with you after its conclusion, however, and it is sure to spark discussion and leave a lasting impression on you.",

However, the film director gives us a mixed-up message regarding their relationship. At the beginning of the film, when the couple is at the kitchen table, Georges sees that the sugar bowl is empty, complains to her and gets upset. Moments later he gets irritated with her when she does not understand something he is talking about. Then they start to argue. Days later, when she is sick and he tries to give her some water, she gets angry and reacts in an unexpected manner. Georges response to her is shocking. Is this the first time, or has he done it before? This couple loves each other in their own particular way. They are not physically affectionate, I don’t think they kiss during the whole movie, I could be wrong. They don’t have either a loving extended family. Georges caresses a pigeon to get the tenderness he does not have.    Georges face expression does not change the whole movie. He has a permanent expression of concern and numbness. He is empty, he is not, in the true sense of the word, alive. He is simply performing the task that has been handed to him. The title of the movie is “Amour” (Love). However when you leave the movie theater the last feeling you have is a loving feeling. You feel numb, empty, like Georges. It is like he has come out from the screen and swallowed you and you have become part of him. I think that this is an outstanding achievement of the director of the film. To have the ability to put the audience in such a mood. I think a very important aspect of the movie is to make you feel what Georges is feeling.

The construction ofchillingly beautiful to the core..Amour4 And A Half Out Of 5Amour is a character driven feature about an old couple that goes through their last phase of the unbroken love when a tragic incident leaves them by shook. The construction of the world depicted in here is so mesmerizing that despite of being restrained within four walls; literally, it is thoroughly busy and competent. Despite of having such bold moves on the chess board, none of them seems to have broken any sort of rule; the audience is never left cheated which often happens whilst leaping few turns. The chemistry is without any doubt, some of the best that the cinema had to offer to the audience and not due to its soothing tone and sweetness involved in it but its three dimensional perspective towards each little things. The writing is genuinely moving, emotionally manipulative and adaptive which leaves the audience in an awe of it; the metaphorical pigeon will haunt you even after the curtain drops. It is rich on technical aspects like the d.o.p., camera work and detailed production design. Smarter sound designing, alluring background score and the ingenious structure of the script are the high points of the feature. Haneke; the screenwriter-director, is in his A game where his script does meet its brilliant execution skills which is rare and exquisite. But in the end, it's all about the act, it's all performance, and boy what an act they have staged. Riva and Trintignant are; similar to their characters, dependent on each other flaunting their behemoth talent on screen that can make viewers' eyes pop out. Amour is chillingly beautiful to the core and not for its knack of drawing out the emotions from the audience but for its loudness that it demands to be seek upon.",
