    "critic_reviews": [
        "This is one of the truly outstanding works of post-war European cinema.",
        "A wonderfully composed movie in which Ingmar Bergman is able to vary the tone from melancholy to gaiety in the most deeply satisfying way",
        "Possibly Ingmar Bergman's finest film and a landmark in film history.",
        "The bitter has not yet overpowered the sweet in this early film from writer-director Ingmar Bergman.",
        "Initially, Wild Strawberries appears to be an almost pointedly unsubtle coming-of-age story that\u2019s been goosed with dime-store surrealism and male handwringing masked as intellectual engagement with humankind. But the bluntness is a misdirection that underlines the depth of Bergman\u2019s empathy with his hero as well as his dedication to his real subject, which is the process of mentally freeing oneself from an insidiously limiting self-mythology.",
        "The story now sounds like fodder for a rote \u201cold codger learns to like people\u201d narrative, but Wild Strawberries is more about a man\u2019s gradual coming to terms with who he was, who he is, and what he\u2019s leaving behind.",
        "A film that goes where many others have gone (yes, this is Scrooge for Ph.D.s) but with a subtlety few have dreamed of?",
        "Wild Strawberries, which, while scarcely a bag of laughs, has a compassionate view of life that best illustrates the more optimistic side of Bergman's puzzled humanity.",
        "Pic sometimes talks too much in philosophical asides, but it remains a searching pictorial analysis of a man\u2019s life. Expert directorial touches and notations of director Ingmar Bergman, and the dignified miming of oldtime director Sjostrom, plus other fine thespic additions, make this an offbeater. It\u2019s a personal and profound work.",
        "Wild Strawberries remains a surprisingly optimistic and affirmative movie about getting old: It\u2019s only natural for people at the end of their lives to reflect on the roads taken or not taken. And there\u2019s peace on the other side.",
        "There's a lot of allegorical baggage on board, but the film's virtues lie in its relative simplicity.",
        "It's an occasionally over-symbolic work (most notably in the opening nightmare sequence), but it's filled with richly observed characters and a real feeling for the joys of nature and youth.",
        "For those who think legendary cine-Swede Ingmar Bergman's films are aloof and coldly austere, this warm, welcoming 1957 road movie of aged reflection - the inspiration for Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry - might come as a surprise.",
        "This one is so thoroughly mystifying that we wonder whether Mr. Bergman himself knew what he was trying to say."

With death just looming around the corner, Professor Borg has one thing in mind: to reminisce. We get to see the heartaches, the euphoria. and the success of a to-be-awarded man in a very occupied day. We unravel throughout the day on why his daughter-in-law calls him someone who has a benevolent exterior but in the inside, as hard as nails. This is probably because of Sara choosing his brother over him which was aggravated more by marrying someone he doesn't really love as much as Sara. He may be an accomplished professor but his life is miserable and lonely.This is the first Ingmar Bergman film I have watched and I am amazed how he captured the old man's emotion with the use of dreams and parallelism in the characters. Terror, endearment, regret, kindness, sorrow, care, and satisfaction. All of these emotions captured so well by Bergman and made us feel what Professor Borg felt in his lifetime. These may be the emotions felt by a human being living in this world. A human life may be full of sorrow but in his dying days, he can still be out of his comfort and change someone's life for the better.Professor Borg woke up from a dream being terrorized by the idea of death but he goes back to sleep with a sense of satisfaction, with a smile on his face knowing that he is close in seeing his parents soon, in a better place.",
