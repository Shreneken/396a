  "critic_reviews": [
    "A gigantic achievement, an endowment of riches.",
    "This movie moves so confidently and looks so good it seems incredible that it's a directorial debut.",
    "While no one is going to place Costner alongside Laurence Olivier in the acting department, he brings a likability to Dunbar that many better performers might not have been able to match.",
    "Costner's directing style is fresh and assured. A sense of surprise and humor accompany Dunbar's adventures at every turn, twisting the narrative gently this way and that and making the journey a real pleasure.",
    "Costner (with Michael Blake's screenplay) creates a vision so childlike, so willfully romantic, it's hard to put up a fight.",
    "The treatment of the Sioux is not only sympathetic, it's ethnographically exact. Neither Noble Savages nor Red Injuns, the natives in Dances With Wolves are differentiated human beings about to undergo cultural genocide.",
    "Of sentiment there is too much and the final sequence when the white men inevitably rear their heads and raise their rifles so fraught with tears and peril as to be exhaustingly melodramatic.",
    "The film's politically correct repudiation of the familiar black-and-white characterizations of the white and red man is ultimately undermined, however, when the pendulum swings too far in the other direction.",
    "Sincere, capable, at times moving, but overextended, this picture is seriously hampered by its tendency to linger over everything--especially landscapes with silhouetted figures, and not excluding its own good intentions.",
    "The movie is so busy turning the Sioux characters into photogenic saints that it never quite allows them the complications of human beings.",
    "A western for people who are completely ignorant about the genre. Costner's direction is barely competent and frequently clumsy.",
    "Mr. Blake's screenplay and Mr. Costner's direction of it are, with the exception of three memorable sequences, commonplace. The film is painstakingly composed of small details of frontier and tribal life that should be riveting. Most of the time they aren't."

The chemistrya rhythmic beat that values..2 July 2018Dances With Wolves4 Out Of 5Dance With Wolves is a character driven feature of an all-lost man that is ready to survive and mold itself into any shape or form for one more chance. The chemistry and the relationship that is built-up among the characters is depicted form the scratch that helps the viewers too connect with the feature; a slick move by the makers. It is rich on technical aspects like costume design, sound department, background score, cinematography and editing. It is shot beautifully and the camera work is charming and makes it immensely pleasing to encounter with great locations and visuals. The writing is strong especially on character's perspective that is judged, accounted and balanced upon nicely. The adaptation by Michael Blake of his own novel, is smart and gripping and the primary reason why it works is his awareness of the characters image and the palpable environment offered to it, since the beginning. Kevin Costner; the director, is surprisingly good considering that it is his first project, as it shows a lot of potential since such character driven feature can easily come off as a dull and over-chewing feature if not executed accordingly. Kevin Costner as the protagonist is convincing in his performance along with his supporting cast like Marry McDonnell and Graham Greene. Dance With Wolves is a rhythmic beat that values its culture and rituals that binds it all to create something colossal out of a mere gesture.",

If I had not already been swept off of my feet, the soundtrack would have swept me off my feet, but in the end, it just serves as further evidence of the sheer beauty of this film. Just wow. In terms of the story, I thought it, as well, was beautifully presented. From the early encounters to the very end, there is a certain beauty to the interaction between the characters as Dunbar adjusts to his new situation. In terms of the acting, Kevin Costner and a cast of relative unknowns did a great job. Initially, I was unsure about Costner and did not like his performance that much in the beginning, but as the film progressed, he won me over completely. The final note I want to make is on the length. It is three hours, so it is up there in terms of time, but it never really shows its length. Instead, it almost tricks you into thinking it is much shorter in the way it utilizes every second to tell its story.",

It is a wonderful film, and a marvel from beginning to end. I am not a Kevin Costner basher, he has done some work I don't care for, but this and a few others(Field of Dreams for instance) actually does show he has talent. He does do a heartfelt job directing, and his acting isn't too shabby either, in fact he gives a certain decency to Dunbar which I had difficulty not empathising with. He is very well supported by Graheme Greene and Mary McDonell who is especially brilliant. The cinematography and scenery are just magnificent, while John Barry's score is nothing short of amazing. The moving climax gives further emotional weight to an already poignant story, while the script is wholly credible and the characters feel real. In conclusion, a fine film and I had no problem with its Best Picture win. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

John Dunbar,In his directorial debut, Kevin Costner brings a rare degree of grace and feeling to this elegiac tale of a hero’s adventure of discovery among the Sioux Indians on the pristine Dakota plains of the 1860s.\r Costner stars as Lt. John Dunbar, a Union officer in the Civil War invited to choose his own post after an act of heroism. Opting for the farthest reaches of the frontier because he “Wants to see it before it disappears,” he transplants himself from a weary and cynical war culture to the windswept clarity of the Dakota plains.\r Arriving at the remote outpost assigned him by an insane major (Maury Chaykin), Dunbar finds it deserted and, to the disbelief of his wagon driver (Robert Pastorelli), opts to unload his provisions and stay.\r His only company as he passes the days are his horse, a gangling wolf who keeps a nervous distance, and, finally, a Sioux Indian who tries to steal the horse and is frightened off by Dunbar.\r Because whites and Indians automatically killed each other upon meeting, each party lived in ignorance of the other. Dunbar’s virtue is that he resists violence, putting himself at risk with the Sioux until they trust him and accept him.\r Dunbar keeps a journal, hoping to create “a trail for others to follow.” He discovers a culture so deeply refreshing to his spirit, compared with the detritus he’s left behind, that, by the time the U.S. Army bothers to look for him, he has become a Sioux and his name is Dances With Wolves.\r Of course, the Union soldiers completely misunderstand his purposes, giving pic the tragic cast this saga historically deserves.\r Script by Michael Blake portrays the Sioux culture with appreciation, establishing within it characters of winning individuality and humor. Design team accents the diverse beauty of the actors (all Native Americans) with striking combinations of paint, feathers and deerskin in costuming.\r Unfortunately, the script seems to have run out of understanding by the time the Union soldiers arrive to do a job on the “traitor” Dunbar, and portrayal of this loutish and brutal mob, who refuse so much as to hear him out, is pic’s weakest and most manipulative passage.\r Still, it makes effective drama and, if interpreted metaphorically, the scene conveys the spirit of rape and plunder that had vanquished the Sioux culture within a mere 13 years of this story’s unfolding, according to the screen epilogue.\r Lensed on location in South Dakota over 17 weeks, pic is infused with the natural grandeur of the plains and sky, captured in all their variance by cinematographer Dean Semler\r Score by John Barry makes a major contribution, varying from the elegiac tone of the main theme to the spirited adventure of classic Westerns, to the heart-racing primal rhythms of the buffalo and scalp dances.\r From its three-hour length, which amazingly does not become tiresome, to its bold use of subtitled Lakota language (the Sioux tongue) for at least a third of the dialogue, it’s clear the filmmakers were proceeding without regard for the rules. Their audacity in doing so, because they knew what they had, is as inspiring as the film itself.\r Costner’s directing style is fresh and assured. A sense of surprise and humor accompany Dunbar’s adventures at every turn, twisting the narrative gently this way and that and making the journey a real pleasure.",

In this movie we finally see Indians portrayed as they probably were: a people with a culture that white Americans were not able to understand. Cavalry officer John Dunbar, on the other hand, understood the Indians, forced by his isolation, but ended up being acculturated by them to the point of marrying an Indian woman. From there, this character follows his heart and his sense of justice more than his rational discernment. The story is deeply romantic and has a touch of sadness because we, the public, know the fate of these Indians, and the film shows us how the Americans knew to be unfair and cruel. Kevin Costner has earned in this film one of the most remarkable works of his career. He was brilliant in the role of the young American officer, to whom the fear, the need and the curiosity lead to initiate dialogue and coexistence with the Indians. Mary McDonnell gave birth to the young Indian who marries Dunbar and filled her character with gentleness, understanding and joy. The way the Indians are represented seems historically accurate, as does the representation of Americans. The wide prairie scenery is a beautiful addition, astounding and astounding the audience. Some sequences, such as marriage or hunting, are worthy of anthology.",

'DancesA beautiful attempt to create a parallel story of the colonization of North America. Even if the storyline is quite predictable and similar to many Disney childish stories it remains interesting to witness the way things are arranged. 'Dances With Wolves' is a really long movie and this quality allows it to tackle many issues and craft deep and intricated characters. There are some fight scenes but it never falls in obnoxious violence. It is marvelous to see a movie like this that fully takes its time to show facial emotions, environment and animals. It does it in a such way that we actually can feel the loneliness of the main character, the amazement of the girl finding back her own roots or the doubt of a worried chief.However if you manage to see American Indians differently as the plot moves forward you will quickly realize that White American settlers are almost all truly one-dimensional. You will probably also land on the conclusion that the lenght of the movie makes its pace inequal and unbalanced.
