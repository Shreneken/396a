A true story of a maverick doctor and the patients whose lives he changes. Dr. Malcolm Sayer, a shy research physician who uses an experimental drug to \"awaken\" the catatonic victims of a rare disease beginning with Leonard, the first patient to receive the controversial treatment. His awakening, filled with awe and enthusiasm, proves a rebirth for Sayer too, as the exuberant patient reveals life's simple but unutterably sweet pleasures to the introverted doctor. Encouraged by Leonard's stunning recovery, Sayer administers the drug to the other patients. The story of their friendship during this emotional journey is a testament to both the tenderness of the human heart and the strength of the human soul. (Sony Pictures)… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "After seeing Awakenings, I read it, to know more about what happened in that Bronx hospital. What both the movie and the book convey is the immense courage of the patients and the profound experience of their doctors, as in a small way they reexperienced what it means to be born, to open your eyes and discover to your astonishment that \"you\" are alive.",
    "Marshall masterfully plays our strings without becoming either melodramatic or maudlin. Like Brian De Palma's \"Bonfire of the Vanities,\" hers is an adaptation that ends with a wake-up call, only here it's done successfully and in context.",
    "And so even if you're held (as I was) by the acting, you may find yourself fighting the film's design. It reflects a certain lack of faith in your audience to take a performance as authentic as De Niro's and reduce it to the level of a glorified reach-out-and-touch-someone commercial.",
    "Knee-jerk tears aside, there's nothing tremendously special. It's very watchable, but it doesn't stand out. Which is not to say the film is badly done; it's just decently done.",
    "But the material is still powerful, and the offbeat story of the patients remains both engrossing and moving even after all this abridgment.",
    "The script pushes all the expected buttons at all the expected moments, leaving you wondering what could have been achieved with a more rigorous, unsentimental approach.",
    "Awakenings both sentimentalizes its story and oversimplifies it beyond recognition. At no point does the film express more than one idea at a time. And the idea expressed, more often than not, is as banal as the reality was bizarre.",
    "Plucks at the heart-strings in a far too push-button way."

No shades. So, we keep realism out of the movie and we focus on the story and how is filmed.Really cliché. The scenes start and you kind of know where they are going. All the little stories and characters are simple enough that you know how they would react, what they would do later, etc.The score is the big difference here. Like Spielberg, without it, this would be kind of trash.The acting is great. Even Robin Williams, which started like he always starts, but then he gets more real after the first act. When the line requires a sad reading of the line and no laughs or optimistic light, he does just that.Its good and likeable and there's nothing wrong with that. Let's just not overrate it like is high in quality",

But the film goesA touching and moving film.I was very happy with this movie. I didn't know him, and I decided to watch him these days because I saw that the film had the participation of Robin Williams, an actor that I really appreciate. But the film goes beyond that, and gives us a deeply moving story, based on a real situation, in which a team of doctors who, in the 60's, sought to help the recovery of catatonic patients who had survived an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica that occurred a few decades earlier, between 1915 and 1926. A relevant and current topic, especially at a time in history when the human race is facing a pandemic that seems to be here to stay.Despite the fact that this disease has always been known, the epidemic of the 1920s is, nowadays, totally forgotten, and by itself deserved more studies and attention from doctors and historians. In fact, I have to conclude, after a brief reading on the subject here and there, that we know very little about what happened: we don't know the causes of the outbreak, nor the mechanics of propagation or what led some patients to death or to catatonia. What we do know, and the film shows us, is that the disease has killed more than a million people and condemned about four million to a life absolutely dependent on others. Living statues. The film is really well done and shows how an original doctor, through creative ideas and a fresh perspective on things, really helped patients that others simply preferred to ignore, to consider as hopeless cases.Robin Williams is excellent and employs a lot of charisma and presence in his work, making his character particularly touching, human, authentic and sympathetic. More surprising was Robert De Niro's performance: far removed from the tough roles that made him famous, the actor had the courage to give life to a vulnerable, insecure, dependent character, a little self-absorbed and eager to make up for decades of lost time. The film also has the participation of Julie Kavner, Ruth Nelson, John Heard and other actors.The film has good cinematography and careful direction. The film was well filmed and edited, and has good sets and costumes, although it is the story told and the performance of the actors that are key to everything else working.",

ItsI found this to be quite an emotional film, its quite touching and indeed hard to watch in parts, particularly towards the end. It asks some challenging questions (as covered above, under 'genre/themes') and is well portrayed by the cast. Its quite thought provoking and I found myself surprised by some things, such as the mother of one of the patients reaction to her previously young boy being more 'with it', suddenly being an adult, having not experienced teenage or young adult life. Its hard not to feel sorry for the various characters and emotionally there are both highs and lows due to the plotline.The main character of Dr. Malcolm Sayer comes across as both sort of plain and straight to the point, while also being clearly very devoted to his patients and to his role, to trying to better them, which made me (as a viewer) more keen to see him succeed and to see what the final outcome would be. Some of the dialogue really is quite poignant - this is a film you'll likely want tissues available for when watching.It does raise some moral questions and is quite good at that, I suppose. I wouldn't say its overly sensationalist - if anything negative could be said about it, its perhaps the slight over use of sentimental music making it seem a bit unnecessarily cheesy from the musical score point of view, infact perhaps sentimentality in general.I'd recommend this film, as I found it to be quite touching and thought provoking with a good plotline and its particularly well portrayed with a good cast. It may not be for everyone I suppose but for what it is, the issues it covers, I'd say its well worth a watch.",
