    "critic_reviews": [
        "Reiner captures just the right level of physical tension, but for the most part wisely emphasises the mental duels. Terrific.",
        "The actors are supported by the best kind of writerly craft and directorial technique, the kind that refuses to call attention to itself, never gets caught straining for scares or laughs. Popular moviemaking -- elegantly economical, artlessly artful -- doesn't get much better than this.",
        "Misery offers a first-rate Hitchcockian thriller filled with amazing performances, solid direction and masterful writing.",
        "The movie has a real kick to it. As Paul and Annie attempt to outsmart each other, Misery gets nastier and nastier. It turns into a psychotic cat-and-mouse game, and there are some genuine shocks.",
        "Reiner\u2019s film, the perfect 90-minuter, is sometimes a little stretched at 107 minutes. Nevertheless it maintains its tension well, plays enough tricks on us so that we don\u2019t ever treat anything quite seriously and Goldman\u2019s script has enough good lines and situations to keep one interested in exactly what is coming next.",
        "There are a few holes in the plot, mainly towards the end, but from start to harrowing finish, it is blissfully apparent that Rob Reiner can indeed turn his hand to virtually anything.",
        "It is a good story, a natural, and it grabs us. But just as there is almost no way to screw it up, so there's hardly any way to bring it above a certain level of inspiration.",
        "Like any good work of popular culture, Rob Reiner's film of Stephen King's best-selling book Misery functions on more than one level.",
        "It seems to want to be a Hitchcockian kind of cat-and-mouse suspense melodrama, which demands a lot more ingenuity than Mr. Reiner or Mr. Goldman ever muster. Misery is just good enough that one wishes it were far better. The ideas are there, but they become lost in the heavy-handed treatment.",
        "The economy of both script and direction is admirable\u2014there's no wasted motion in sight\u2014though the film's anthology of genre cliches ultimately undermines Bates's heroic efforts to make it something more.",
        "James Caan is excellent as the writer and Kathy Bates is brilliant as his captor. Unfortunately, what could have been a seamless psychological thriller is interrupted by violence that's as gratuitous as it is sadistic.",
        "In the Kill the Bitch tradition of FATAL ATTRACTION, this adaptation of Stephen King's misogynist fable about a serious (male) author trapped by his own frivolous (female) commercial creation isn't quite satisfying either as a flat-out horror screamer or a psychological thriller.",
        "A weak handshake of a movie, it is slightly repellent -- hardly gripping, much less knuckle-whitening. This \"Psycho\" for fatsos is as self-aware as it is styleless."

What follows isAdapted from Stephen King\u2019s 1987 novel, Misery tells the story of bestselling author, Paul Sheldon (James Caan), rescued from the wreckage of a near fatal car crash by his \u201cNo.1 fan\u201d the seemingly solicitous Annie Wilkes. What follows is typical King fare, a psychological game of cat and mouse that ranges from the surprisingly droll to the disturbingly brutal.As Stephen King adaptations go, Misery is fairly well done, a faithful if slightly pacified version of a story that naturally hooks us in. It\u2019s really elevated by two fantastic lead performances with James Caan playing captive writer Sheldon with an understated brilliance. The real stand out, however, comes from Kathy Bates (an Oscar winner for her role), who plays the unpredictable Annie with a remarkable level of complexity and realism. A subplot involving Richard Farnsworth\u2019s Sheriff meanders along, but the bulk of the film is a two-player game, complete with scenes of biting tension, sporadic violence and unnerving tenderness. Marc Shaiman\u2019s score adds a chilling touch that suits the film\u2019s slow build from the typical to the terrifying.There are enough gems of excitement in Misery to keep us interested (even at a slightly stretched 107-minute run time), but the film lacks both the introspection and horror of its source material. There are moments of greatness (the famous \u2018hobbling\u2019 scene springs to mind), but much of the film is approached with a heavy-handedness, never as clever nor as scary as it seems to think it is. Nevertheless, the film remains pretty much consistently entertaining, with just enough surprises to keep it afloat. In the end, Misery may be rather uninspired, but it\u2019s a loyal and well-crafted adaptation of a good story, elevated by a scintillating central performance from Kathy Bates.",

I don\u2019t really call this a horror movie because it\u2019s not scary but it\u2019s more like a thriller, there\u2019s drama. It was directed by Rob Reiner, who had also directed A Few Good Men (1992), Shock and Awe (2017), The Princess Bride (1987) and the screenplay was written by an author William Goldman, who had written novels like The Princess Bride in 1973, which was transferred into a movie  in 1987 also directed by Rob Reiner, Which Lie Did I Tell?, \u2026 It\u2019s about a psychotic fan who holds an author captive and forces him to write her stories. There was James Caan as the author, Paul Sheldon, who wrote romance novels about a character called Misery Chastain, when he had an accident, he was carried to someone else\u2019s house. It was revealed that the house belonged to his number 1 fan, Annie Wilkes played by Kathy Bates, who won an Oscar for Best Actress in 1991. She acted exactly how the number 1 fan in this film should be like: psychotic, crazy, insane and sometimes can be like an a-hole. I hate her but she\u2019s well-acted and well-developed thanks to Bates. Caan did a well job too. I was just disappointed that he wasn\u2019t even nominated for Best Actor in 1991.  Barry Sonnenfeld was really good with the cinematography. It was kinda old-school and also suitable for a 90s thriller. I also like the story though I haven\u2019t read the book yet. I was really surprised when Sheldon read the red book filled with newspapers and found out that Wilkes was a nurse murderer and killed many patients and the only jump scare I saw was when Buster, the local sheriff was shot by Wilkes with the rifle when he found out that Paul Sheldon was locked in a room or a cellar maybe? And also it\u2019s just a story, why did Wilkes had to scream so bad about a character\u2019s death? That\u2019s just annoying! The original score was okay though, Marc Shaiman was okay as well. I didn\u2019t care about the score much in this film because I didn\u2019t hear the music much, I just care about the screenplay and Goldman wrote it excellently. I like it even though I saw a few sentences were a bit too easy. Misery isn\u2019t really a horror movie, it\u2019s just a drama and thriller which had blood in there. There wasn\u2019t much scare but it was a really good movie. Stephen King wrote the plot really well, Reiner directed excellently, the score was played okay, the cinematography was also well-shot by Sonnenfeld and more\u2026 Caan and Bates were perfect for these roles making this movie one of the greatest Stephen King\u2019s adaptation.

On its own terms too, it is a brilliant film with a wonderful atmosphere especially. The film looks very good, with the sets, costumes, locations and cinematography striking and suitably atmospheric. The screenplay is very fine, exploring themes such as fanatical devotion, artistic dilemmas and worthiness of commercial fiction without a psychological suspense context, while the story is always well paced and compelling.Also outstanding is the direction of Rob Reiner. He adeptly exercises in chilling claustrophobia and allows a numerous numbers of genuine jolts. The acting is great, James Caan, Richard Farnsworth and Lauren Bacall are all great but the film belongs to Kathy Bates who is monstrously scary and deservedly won an Oscar for her brilliant performance.Overall, Misery is a superb film and one of the best Stephen King adaptations. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I suppose the jump scares, when they come, are a bit more impactful though, due to this, if that makes sense but I'd classify it as primarily psychological based. I found the characterisations probably the best aspect of the film, with great performances from both James Caan and Kathy Bates. Paul's frustration and desperation to leave his confines makes for quite a gripping watch, although there are some parts of the plot which may be a little slow moving for some people's taste. I suppose as time moves on, some film viewers may be more impatient than those of the past perhaps. The topic/theme of obsessive fans is, if anything, more relevant or contemporary than ever in the age of social media, I reckon and so it makes for a somewhat thought provoking watch as well. The presence of the typewriter made me think of The Shining (also based on a Stephen King novel), only in this instance its not the villain who uses it, rather the victim.This is certainly a decent film that's, as I say, well worth a watch and so I would recommend it, yes.",
