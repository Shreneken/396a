    "summary": "Robert Gould Shaw leads the U.S. Civil War's first all-black volunteer company, fighting prejudices from both his own Union Army, and the Confederates.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Glory is, without question, one of the best movies ever made about the American Civil War.",
        "An eloquent, heart-tugging Civil War epic about the first black infantry regiment to march off to battle for the Union. And epic is the word. Not since John Ford has a film maker created such dramatic large-scale Civil War battle scenes in a major theatrical film.",
        "Voice-over narration makes effective use of the real-life Shaw's correspondence, but in terms of authenticity the battle sequences are truly impressive. Marching across open fields amid cannon-shot, or plunging into hand-to-hand combat, the stark clarity of Freddie Francis' cinematography combined with Zwick's intimate style evokes immediacy and fear.",
        "This stirring historical re-creation depicts the experiences of America's first unit of black soldiers in the Civil War and the young Northerner who leads them.",
        "Glory is a strong and valuable film no matter whose eyes it is seen through.",
        "Richly plotted, alternately inspiring and horrifying, Glory is an enlightening and entertaining tribute to heroes too long forgotten.",
        "Exceptionally well-rendered and emotive war drama.",
        "Glory is celebratory, but it celebrates in a manner that insists on acknowledging the sorrow. This is a good, moving, complicated film.",
        "It is the movie's often awesome imagery and a bravely soaring choral score by James Horner that transfigure the reality, granting it the status of necessary myth.",
        "A pretty watchable and always interesting period film, well photographed by English cinematographer Freddie Francis.",
        "Though the film has an evocative look reminiscent of Matthew Brady\u2019s period photographs, Zwick has stuffed the actors\u2019 mouths with numbing bombast. Glory is a shame."
