  "critic_reviews": [
    "Kevin has the potential to be the mawkish child or the obnoxious little adult so common on screen, but he is neither. Played with great glee by Macaulay Culkin, he is a totally endearing, up-to-the-minute little boy.",
    "This holiday contender from John Hughes is too crass, too loud and too violent to be added blithely to Christmas viewing traditions.  But it is funny.",
    "The movie has a big payoff; it's the setup that's the drag. But Kevin's antics will touch the budding subversive in every kid. My advice? Hide the car keys.",
    "Home Alone is the apex, the pinnacle, the culmination of every bad bit Hughes has ever written or directed. It overflows with primitive, disastrously unfunny sight gags and neo-hateful familial humor.",
    "Even though Macaulay Culkin's alternately muggy and inexpressive lead performance hasn't worn well, the supporting turns by Catherine O'Hara and John Candy are especially crackerjack, as is John Williams' buoyantly cartoony score.",
    "All plausibility is gone, we sit back, detached, to watch stunt men and special effects guys take over a movie that promised to be the kind of story audiences could identify with.",
    "The first half of Home Alone features the sugar-coated sentimentality that can usually be found in a Hughes film, while the second half is full of unanticipated sadism.",
    "So it may not be Citizen Kane, but it is a hilarious comedy (although not a very believable one — there can be no eight-year-olds this ingenious) that kids will love and adults won’t mind sitting through either.",
    "The movie is quite enjoyable as long as it explores the fantasy of a neglected little boy having an entire house of his own to explore and play in, but the physical cruelty that dominates the last act leaves a sour taste, and the multiple continuity errors strain one's suspension of disbelief to near the breaking point."

I highly doubt that anyone reading a movie review blog hasn't seen this film by now, butIt was my favorite movie as a kid, it featured my very first crush, and while there have been many copycats, there will only ever be one Home Alone. I highly doubt that anyone reading a movie review blog hasn't seen this film by now, but those select few...The film centers on Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) a bratty kid, whose extended family is preparing for Christmas in Paris. During dinner, Kevin starts a fight with his older brother, Buzz, and is sent to sleep alone in the attic. An overnight power failure leaves the family rushing to catch their flight and Kevin gets left home alone. At the same time, a pair of idiotic home invaders working his neighborhood and want to rob his house. Kevin sees himself as the man of the house now and knows its his job to defend it. As his parents rush to get back to him, Kevin prepares for war! Home Alone is the epitome of a family film and is what all family films aspire to be. These films all claim to be fun for the whole family, but lets face it, they're geared toward children. Most of the time you take the family to see them and twenty minutes in you're on your phone or falling asleep, but not here. The chemistry between Joe Pesci and Macaulay Culkin is fantastic. We all know Pesci for his mobster roles, so it's easy to forget that he got his start as a comedic actor, and it is actually what he does best. Paired with a great cast, a legendary director, and a terrific story, this is simply the best family feature film I have ever seen. Home Alone has something for everyone. It will make you laugh, cry, and beg for more, and that's why there are five god awful sequels and a whole bunch of other films trying to duplicate the magic of this film, but as I said earlier there will only ever be one Home Alone and it is an absolute must see movie!",

Macaulay Culkin is wonderful as Kevin. In this and Home Alone 2, which is my personal favourite, he is cute and self-assured. Alex D Linz gives a spirited performance in Home Alone 3, but Michael Weinburg just doesn't do anything with the script(which was terrible), other than whine in the fourth film. Anyway back to Home Alone. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern steal the film, with their goofiness and charm that was evidently missed in the last two instalments. Matching them, is the late great John Candy, and here he is wonderful. Candy has starred in movies like Uncle Buck and Planes, Trains and Automobiles, both of which are hilarious. Home Alone just broadens the comedic talent, that Candy certainly had. The film looks beautiful, with very good direction, and best of all great visual jokes and traps, as well as a fun and sometimes touching script. My problem is why is the rating for both Home Alone and Home 2 so low, when almost everyone I know consider them as holiday classics? All in all, a funny, touching and underrated film, that could have been a little shorter(only by one or two minutes). 9/10 Bethany Cox",

There are some classic scenes that will have you rolling on the floor laughing even if you remember them, so it's strongly suggested as it's a classic Christmas comedy indeed.",

Home Alone is a well made film and theDirector Chris Columbus gives us this typical comedy called \"HOME ALONE\" which was made in 1990 and stars Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, John Candy and many other actors.. (some women lmao). Home Alone is a well made film and the traps Kevin McCallister (Culkin) sets for two burglars after his parents leave him home alone by accident are well done and constructed. There are funny scenes galore as the burglars get their hands burnt, slip over and allsorts of daft things whilst trying to break into the McCallister house for money, jewellery and stuff and Home Alone isn't the worst film made but I've a few problems with it.... Macaulay Culkin who plays Kevin is stubborn, unlikeable and annoying and everyone I watch Home Alone I always want the burglars to win because Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are more likeable by miles than Macaulay Culkin and funny too so that's a serious problem in this movie that the badguys are in theory the good guys because I love the burglars but hate Macaulay Culkin! My second problem with Home Alone is when Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) after being left at home alone goes shopping by himself as if that wasn't daft enough here comes the big shocker, after he's bought groceries and leaves a police officer chases the little kid who's not fast but fails to even stay with him let alone catch him because he's some fat, elephant sized man in a suit and an obese police officer who's unhealthy.. This scene is an insult to all police officers around the world and is so unrealistic. These are my problems with Home Alone and Culkin sucks but great acting by the burglars, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern and even John Candy and I rated Home Alone a 3 because of the burglars and the burglars only and that's being generous because the rest of the film is crap.",

It is the story of Kevin who is the youngest son of the McCallister family. When his family wants to spend Christmas in Paris he is forgotten at their home in Chicago because of an unlucky chain of events (They took great care to make the family not look careless or abandoning). Kevin is now “Home Alone” and enjoys his freedom while his family is on their way back with his now panic fueled mother ahead of the others. There are however 2 burglars who use the holidays for a series of raids on holiday abandoned homes and have picked the McCallister household as target. This starts the humorous events. Like I already said this is a Christmas comedy and works well. It is part of the writing, humor and actors that are combined creating an enjoyable movie. The story works because it is relatable. You can understand all characters motivations. Be it Kevin who can do things he would never be allowed before, his family or the burglars. Then there is the humor and slapstick. It has the Tom and Jerry appeal. The actors are also well chosen. Macaulay Culkin is one of a few child actors that delivers. It is hard at this age and many stars who become legends later on failed earlier as children or even as teens. The other stars are the 2 thieves Harry played by Joe Pesci who is a legendary actor and Marv played b Daniel Stern who has also a great career. Both fully deliver and improved this movie with their performance. Special credits to Kevins mother played by Catherine O’Hara. Her journey to get as fast as possible to her son is entertaining and well acted. She is just great and has an awesome carer because of her skills. I will give credits to the director Chris Columbus and producer / writer John Huges for creating this. Non of the above would have worked without their great work. Then of cause is the music by the legend himself John Williams. He is probably the Michael Jackson of film-music. Overall it is not hard to see why this became a success. It fully delivers and is the kind of movie you can rewatch once in a while. It became a classic and would be missed if not shown on Christmas.",

'Home Alone' is an enjoyable festive comedy that, at times, overreach its grasp, but when the movie's fun, it's fun. An eight year old boy named Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) is often mistreated by his family, he is the youngest in his household, and from their point of view, causes a lot of trouble. Things get worse when his parents, Kate (Catherine O'Hara) and Peter (John Heard) take off to Paris, and on the flight, realize that they accidentally left Kevin at home, so close to Christmas. However, Kevin seems to have the time of his life when he is free to do whatever he wants without adults often telling him off. But not all things are at peace when two burglars; Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) plan to rob from the neighborhood while everyone is out on holiday. Their main target; the McCallister household. Kevin later realizes this and decides to take matters into his own hands. 'Home Alone', which is directed by Chris Columbus and written by John Hughes ('Planes, Trains, and Automobiles') is very funny, and very charming at the same time. A young Macaulay Culkin is able to carry the entire film through and through, and there is even a good message at the end that both adults and children alike should be able to understand.",
