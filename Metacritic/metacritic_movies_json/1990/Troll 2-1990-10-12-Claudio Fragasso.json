  "critic_reviews": [
    "The script is stupid, the acting is wooden, the special effects are laughable, the vintage-80s synthesizer score is cheesy. The movie's paranoid premise is boiled down from two superior sci-fi movies, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) and The Day of the Triffids (1962). And there are no trolls.",
    "Any attempt to obscure the names of those involved in the making of this fiasco can only be construed as an act of mercy. Troll 2 is really as bad as they come."

This film is dreadful, but because it is dreadful it is somewhat hilarious. The cinematography and editingTroll 2 has been cited as one of the worst movies ever or the father of bad movies and such. After finally seeing it, I have to concur. This film is dreadful, but because it is dreadful it is somewhat hilarious. The cinematography and editing are incredibly slip shod and the costumes of the trolls(or shall I say goblins) are quite horrible. The story also meanders all over the place, the script is abysmal and the direction is wretched. Then there is the poor pacing and atrocious acting, and any hopes of any thrills or scares are replaced with scatterings of unintentional laughs and often for the wrong reasons. Overall, it is a dreadful film, but it does have some unintentional entertainment value unlike some of the other bad movies I've seen. 1/10 Bethany Cox",
