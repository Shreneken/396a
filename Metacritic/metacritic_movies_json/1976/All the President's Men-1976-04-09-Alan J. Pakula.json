That night triggered revelations that would eventually drive a U.S. President from office. Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) and Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) grabbed the initial break-in story and stayed with it through doubts, denials and discouragement.

    "critic_reviews": [
        "Based on Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein\u2019s best-seller about cracking the byzantine Watergate cover-up, the movie is a victory lap for American journalism \u2014 the triumphant flip side to Network\u2018s self-loathing take on the media.",
        "A riveting, superbly acted political thriller.",
        "One of modern American film\u2019s most intelligent and provocative accounts of a nation\u2019s political failings, and a near-perfect depiction of journalism at its purist and most inspired. To be more succinct, it is quite brilliant.",
        "Despite the twists, turns and exceptionally complex detail of the Watergate scandal, All the President\u2019s Men manages to make it both comprehensible and watchable \u2013 with a few flashy fictional touches to gussy up the facts.",
        "The manners and methods of big-city newspapering, beautifully detailed, contribute as much to the momentum of the film as the mystery that's being uncovered. Maybe even more, since the real excitement of All The President's Men is in watching two comparatively inexperienced reporters stumble onto the story of their lives and develop it triumphantly, against all odds.",
        "Some ingenious direction by Alan J. Pakula and scripting by William Goldman remove much of the inherent dramatic lethargy in any story of reporters running down a story.",
        "Drawn from the true adventures of the Washington Post reporters and their illustrious editor Ben Bradlee, the movie heroically recounts the dogged journalistic sleuthing that cracked the story of the Watergate break-in and cover-up.",
        "The ingeniousness of screenwriter William Goldman and director Alan J. Pakula\u2019s film is that it\u2019s framed as a detective mystery.",
        "It provides the most observant study of working journalists we're ever likely to see in a feature film. And it succeeds brilliantly in suggesting the mixture of exhilaration, paranoia, self-doubt, and courage that permeated the Washington Post as its two young reporters went after a presidency.",
        "All the President\u2019s Men\u2019s masterstroke is how it rejects mythologizing the pivotal history behind it, appropriately forgoing a climax by closing on a simple telex furiously relaying messages. The film doesn\u2019t present two underdogs bringing down a president; it\u2019s two reporters doing business as usual.",
        "The film features a host of fine character portrayals and a compelling climax that compensates for its length.",
        "Within the stylistic limits and shortened time span the filmmakers have decided to use, All the President's Men is an exceptionally well-made film. It's simply impossible to suppress the feeling that a more involving and satisfying movie would have emerged from a less restrictive framework.",
        "One has the impression that Goldman realized you can push a good thing just so far, or that audiences will follow reportorial plotting just so long.",
        "Inevitably softened by hints of self-congratulation concerning the success of Woodward and Bernstein's uncovering of the Watergate affair, Pakula's film is nevertheless remarkably intelligent, working both as an effective thriller (even though we know the outcome of their investigations) and as a virtually abstract charting of the dark corridors of corruption and power.",
        "Alan Pakula's pedestrian 1976 recap of Watergate is a study in missed opportunities."

Every character from Ben Bradley (Jason Robards we love you) and Hal Holbrook (does that guy ever put a foot wrong)as Deep Throat to bookkeeper Jane Alexander is drawn with nuance and played with subtlety as the enormity of the exercise closes around them. Pakula shoots fabulous wide shots of Government buildings that dwarf the players, accentuating their ant-like existance within the towers of Babel they hope to pull down. The library scene where a shaky camera moves up into the ceiling slowly reveals the two journalists caught in the spider's web of deceit which they must unravel before the spider gets to them first. And still there is time for fun. Like when Hoffman lights up a cigarette in the elevator, as the doors close on them Redford asks \"Is there anywhere you don't smoke?\" A brilliant and detailed exploration of what now seem like innocent times and a nostalgic love story of journalism, that once proud and dignified profession.",

The story is told straight, and it really does work as an entertaining piece of cinema. The plot never meanders from the cat and mouse game between The Washington Post's Woodward and Bernstein, and a secretive and well financed dirty tricks campaign working within Nixon's re-election committee.    There is a lot of great detail about journalistic ethics and practice, and the tension between protecting anonymous sources, and getting it \"on the record\".Also a short standout scene featuring Robert Walden as Donald Segretti, as one of the campaign's gonzo operatives.",

Though, yes, it most certainly helps that the story in play is already fascinating enough -- and true, to boot -- it also doesn't hurt to have one of the world's greatest screenwriters staging your scene dynamics, drafting up your dialogue, and structuring your overall narrative. Aside from William Goldman's expertly constructed screenplay, this also just so happens to represent Alan J. Pakula putting on an absolute clinic in how to make a seemingly dry movie look incredible. From the dank, expressive corners of a darkened parking structure, to the blindingly bright interiors of the Washington Post's office floor, it all feels expertly staged and shot. Oh, and Redford and Hoffman are pretty damned good as well. Not that that needed clearing up or anything. In the end, \"All The President's Men\" is an engrossing, beautifully realized story of power, journalistic integrity, and the importance of getting/making things right.",

Pakula made a very smart decision by not making this movie longer. Because I think Oliver Stone made a mistake by making the runtime of JFK three hours and nine minutes, and the director's cut even longer by 17 minutes! The result, in the case of JFK, was that the movie focused more than it should do on some subplots that really didn't add too much to the story. All the President's Men, instead, made a good use of every minute in it with its reasonable runtime. The Oscar-winner script, with all its cleverness, isn't the only powerful aspect about the movie. Alan J. Pakula directing is very entertaining. Besides building the tension, he shot many long scenes that really deserve to be of the most iconic scenes in film. The performances are all great; Redford has the most of the screen time, and I wouldn't have been surprised if he had an Oscar nod. He has a particular scene in which he changed his face expressions so gracefully. Hoffman is one of my favorite actors and he gave one of his best performances in this movie; his character is so energetic and impulsive and he just got it right. But the performance that really standout is Jason Robards' performance as Ben Bradlee, the executive editor of The Washington Post. Robards, without a doubt, deserved his Oscar for best supporting actor.At the middle of its third act, I think the movie suffered a little bit moving between two sub-plots; it moved very fast between them and I think it should have made a small breather to keep me gripped, and to make me invested in the new sub-plot from its beginning.There were many secondary characters in this movie and they were all great, except one character that I felt it should have given some more depth because it has an important role near the end, and a background could have filled some logical gaps. With that being said, this character is very interesting and you may be interested to search about it after watching the movie.Overall, All the President's Men can be described as a \"Hitchcockian\" political thriller. Its tension and suspense are unprecedented in this sub-genre. And I loved it!(8.5/10)",
