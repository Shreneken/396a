Having heard that he will soon be dumped by the UBS for \"skewing too old,\" Beal announces to his viewers that he will commit suicide on his next and final program. Eyeing ratings gold with this news, an ambitious programming executive convinces the powers that be not to fire Beal on the spot.  The tables turn, however, when instead of going through the act, Beal launches into rhetoric about the state of the world and concludes his tirade with \"I'm mad as Hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!\" [MGM]\u2026 Expand",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Network is typical of the cool intelligence of '70s American cinema.",
        "Timeless and essential.",
        "This still-prescient vivisection of modern culture\u2019s vapidity crackles with the nervous energy of midtown\u2019s hothouse broadcasters.",
        "Network is an outstanding satire that has become more rather than less relevant with each passing year. It is bitingly funny, whip smart and as mad as hell.",
        "[A] prescient and sharply drawn comedy about the depths to which one unscrupulous station will sink.",
        "So the movie's flawed. So it leaves us with loose ends and questions. That finally doesn't bother me, because what it does accomplish is done so well, is seen so sharply, is presented so unforgivingly, that Network will outlive a lot of tidier movies.",
        "Sidney Lumet\u2019s direction is outstanding.",
        "Whatever its flaws, Network is a picture that can stand on its own. And does.",
        "Network can be faulted both for going too far and not far enough, but it's also something that very few commercial films are these days. It's alive. This, I suspect, is the Lumet drive. It's also the wit of performers like Mr. Finch, Mr. Holden, and Miss Dunaway.",
        "It's a dark, dark comedy that ruthlessly skewers the news industry on a stake, then roasts it alive.",
        "The film is immaculately cast...The principal figures in its ideological debate \u2013 the chilly, number-crunching executive Robert Duvall, godlike network supremo Ned Beatty and the ambitious, exploitative programmer Faye Dunaway \u2013 are vivid caricatures. But the movie runs out of steam as satiric invention turns into fervent, deeply sincere statement, and solid William Holden\u2019s middle-aged producer becomes the representative of old-fashioned integrity.",
        "There's an amazing display of acting talent, even though director Lumet doesn't quite tie all the strands together.",
        "Good campy fun from the combined talents of Paddy Chayefsky and Sidney Lumet; Chayefsky was apparently serious about much of this shrill, self-important 1976 satire about television, interlaced with bile about radicals and pushy career women,",
        "There is a lunatic energy about it. Every once in a while, Chayefsky abandons the struggle to dramatize his ideas and has somebody, usually Holden, just turn to the camera and spout off. In those moments, his concern \u2014 and sometimes his mother wit \u2014 comes blazing through and the picture takes on a life not found in safe, sane, well-calculated movies.",
        "He hardly bothers with the characters; the movie is a ventriloquial harrangue. He thrashes around in messianic God-love booziness, driving each scene to an emotional peak."

Sidney Lumet is in his A game and along with a beautiful cinematography and conservative editing, the 'directorial' objective is successfully achieved. Faye Dunaway and William Holden are convincingly good in their parallel role but the real game changer is Peter Finch as a supporting cast. Network is not your typical controversial informative feature, but is more brutal and dark that is depicted nicely with the help of a cunning script, stellar performances and brilliant execution on its side.",

It's thoroughly devastating, and that's because it doesn't work on one level. While Network's wry humor is very sharp and truly sore, it's the sympathy I had for Howard Beale, Peter Finch's character, that got me. Actually, the movie's obvious flaw is that the aspect that is focused on, which is the political satirical one, is underdeveloped, or let's say that all small changes that happen don't make the story any better, instead, they made the satire less sharp, and made me less interested in the story.By contrast, the character of Beale is continuously developed, and it's character arc is painful to witness from the very beginning to the end. However, what really made me engaged despite the semi-hollow main plot are two things:the first thing is the intelligent dialogue; it should be listed in top 10 movie dialogues of all-time. It easily can trick us as the plot is very well-developed.The second thing is the characters, not only Howard Beale, but almost every character is a three-dimensional one. Specially when I was totally invested in all the characters, and how couldn't I with, maybe, the greatest cast ensemble performing the roles?Of course, Peter Finch is great, and balances very well between his moments of wrath, and his moments of psychopathic coldness. But, c'mon, his performance is far cry from De Niro's in Taxi Driver, which is arguably the best performance in film. The performances that standout for me are William Holden's as Max Schumacher, he really deserved to win the Oscar, and Faye Dunaway's performance as Diana Christensen, which I think this is her best performance ever even better than her performance in Chinatown , and, fortunately, she took the Oscar for this role as the Best Actress in a Leading Role. Robert Duvall also, and as usual, gave a terrific performance. Needless to say, the entire cast is phenomenal!I want to say that I love Sidney Lumet direction. He always shot the conversations in his movies in a way that make us feel they actually happen in real life, and 12 Angry Men and Dog Day Afternoon are the finest examples. But in the case of Network, there are some scenes that don't need to be shot this fast, they needed a little more focus, a little more dramatic feeling. The result is some scenes that could have been more effective if they were less rushed, also, there are some acting, which is great, that seemed to be over the top. And that's just because the direction, not the acting itself, except one scene in which the acting was really hammy. Also, the ending is rushed, but it's very shocking. With that being said, Lumet established a disturbing atmosphere, that due to it, nothing in this movie would have worked.All in all, I enjoyed watching this movie that left a bitter taste in mouth, because of nothing but its accuracy which made it very relevant nowadays. And despite all its major flaws, Sidney Lumet made a satirical drama that still one of a kind.(8/10)",

Great dialogues (and even better monologues!) and acting. Seemingly, it's daringly revealing. Some points it rises hit eerily close to home (esp. during this covid craze). But, it's still programming. And I've a feeling I missed the gist of it (apart from the usual: spreading despair, nihilism, atheism and moral rot). The melodrama arc is not believable and way too meta. The movie's focal point, the Howard Beale character, feels an artificial stooge. Strange one, for sure.",
