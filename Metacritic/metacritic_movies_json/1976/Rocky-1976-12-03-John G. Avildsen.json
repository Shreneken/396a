    "summary": "Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a Philadelphia club fighter who seems to be going nowhere. But when a stroke of fate puts him in the ring with a world heavyweight champion, Rocky knows that it's his one shot at the big time; a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to go the distance and come out a winner! [MGM]",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "On paper, neither character may seem terribly appealing, but on the screen they steal your heart away, but completely...Not only did that last reel include some of the most wildly exciting fight footage ever put on the screen, but it also provided an emotionally gratifying capstone to a picture that is truly an ode to the human spirit.",
        "By now, everyone knows who wins, but the scenes before the fight set us up for it so completely, so emotionally, that when it's over we've had it. We're drained.",
        "The basic storyline has been done to death over the years; this is still one of the most effective and successful applications of the formula.",
        "Stallone is totally engaging Rocky playing him with a mixture of boyish intensity, lusty sensuality and cheerful innocence. And Shire is equally appealing, slowly blossoming into a vibrant young woman, and Burt Young seethes with anger as her embittered brother.",
        "This is really Sly's movie as he slugs his way through a heartfelt performance and delivers some cracking punches, both literally and emotionally.",
        "As drenched in sentiment as it is in sweat, as much love story as fight film, this classic tale of a tireless \"bum\" who makes good is one of the most uplifting films ever made.",
        "Rocky is an old-fashioned fairytale brilliantly revamped to chime in with the depressed mood of the '70s. Although its plot - nonentity gets to fight the heavyweight champ - is basically fantasy, the film deftly manages to suspend disbelief by drawing back at its more implausible moments.",
        "A great movie? Hardly. Stallone as the next Brando? You've got to be kidding. A nice little fantasy picture? Maybe. That's the hype and reality of Rocky, the flatout schmaltzy saga of a Philadelphia club boxer who, on New Year's Day of our Bicentennial Year, gets a chance to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world. . . .",
        "While art by definition must trigger certain emotional responses, occasionally there\u2019s too-obvious a feeling of really being manipulated and stroked. Fact that Rocky gets his big chance from cynical schemers\u2013with a black public hero as the instigator\u2013rests uneasily at moments. Then there are occasional flashes that the film may be patronizing the lower end of the blue-collar mentality, as much if not more than the characters who keep putting Rocky down on the screen. However, Avildsen is noted for creating such ambiguities.",
        "The story is achingly familiar, and though Stallone has a certain power, he is certainly not the subtlest actor to crawl out from under Marlon's overcoat. But the picture goes most wrong in the conceit it employs to lift Rocky out of the clubs and into the big arena for his title challenge.",
        "The problem, I think, comes back to Mr. Stallone. Throughout the movie we are asked to believe that his Rocky is compassionate, interesting, even heroic, though the character we see is simply an unconvincing actor imitating a lug."

Rocky's character arc is so familiar that everyone, even who don't watch many movies, knows every single detail about it. But the movie adds a simple twist, yet a very effective one, in the character's motivations.But it didn't stop here, as the movie keeps raising the stakes by making an advantage of all the developments that have been given to all the characters.The movie could have easily used the ups and downs of Rocky to evoke our feelings. Instead, the movie succeeded to be very moving by taking advantage of the very new twist that has been added to Balboa's motivations. The result is an underdog heroic character that is by no means clich\u00e9d. And Stallone shines in this movie and gave his best performance in his career. There are some moments when Rocky's confidence has been shaken a little bit and the hero starts to tell the message of the story and these moments somewhat worked, and they could have never worked without Sylvester Stallone's superb acting.I said that Rocky takes advantage of the developments of all its characters. Yes, all its characters!The character of Adrian, for instance, has some realistic and genuine details that make the romance between her and Rocky works very well, although the relationship proceeds so fast. Talia Shire performance made Adrian even more realistic,unique and very compelling character.Paulie is another great character that made the movie even more poignant as it gave some depth for Rocky too.What I didn't like so much is Apollo Creed. In contrast to the rest of the characters, he is nothing but the stereotypical undefeated Champion. Also, all decisions he made exposed the movie's clich\u00e9d story. With that being said, his scenes are masterfully directed and he has a very catchy style.  The final fight scene is maybe the most realistic fight scene has been shot at that time. And those who think it's not, please watch a boxing match and you'll find that boxing punches make sounds different from the comic book punches sounds that are still used in movies today.(9/10)",

The performances of course are amazing and the wit and humor of the characters adds a special charm and lets not forget the fun boxing matches, that when you finally see them are very rewarding and engaging. The punch sound effects are pretty bad and Apollo Creed was a pretty stereotypical opponent however. The motivations of these characters and how they interact is really what made this film special.",

Rocky is a smart movie; which came off as a surprise to me, the whole movie is a build up to the much awaited fight giving the perfect value and gravitas to the event that it deserved but fails on living up to the expectation for the choreography is way too lose. John seems like an amateur when it comes to execute physical sequences but does a decent job for the rest of it maybe because he probably didn't have to do much since the writing is good enough to sail on its own and Sylvester is amazing on both the roles with a good enough supporting cast. Rocky is the slow ride that is comfortable and in an appropriate tone to its characters and plot giving enough space for the actors and the audience to chew it in.",

Even people that have never seen the movie know who Rocky is. Every day many people still run up the \u201cRocky Stairs\u201d at the Museum of Art in Philadelphia and raise their arms like Rocky did in the movie. It is the charm of this underdog story with relatable characters and great pictures. For the story: Heavyweight champion Apollo Creed played by Carl Weathers can not fight for the title because his challenger injured his hand. Because it is too late to get a new professional challenger they decided to give an amateur the once in lifetime chance to fight for the championship. Because of Rocky's nickname \u201cThe Italian Stallion\u201d he is picked by Apollo Creed without even caring. It is Sylvester Stallone's best role as he plays the relatable and sympathetic everyman that has a hard life and struggles. There is the heartwarming lovestory between him and Adrianna Pennino played by Talia Shire. There is the struggle with his trainer Mickey Goldmill played by Burgess Meredith that knows Rocky's potential but also says that he wasted it. Finally it is Rocky's iron hard training as he will do everything to use his chance and trains like never before that wins many over. The final fight is as dramatic as intense as Apollo Creed expected an easy opponent and thought he would win before he even get sweaty. He gets someone who is filled to the brim with willpower and determination. The ending is pure bittersweet awesome. All things mentioned above create an unforgettable experience. The Rocky series is still strong and entered pop culture history long ago. It is the blueprint for underdog stories that always touch something inside of us. Overall this is an all time classic and rightfully so. A must see even if you don't like boxing. Bonus knowledge: There is a real live fight that inspired this movie. Muhammad Ali fought against Chuck Wepner whose nickname was \u201cThe Bayonne Bleeder\u201d in 1975. Everyone expected a fast knockout but Chuck gave the performance of his live and even knocked down Ali. The fight got even to round 15 when Ali won. Sylvester Stallone saw this fight and was impressed by this man. The rest is history as he wrote the script to Rocky.",

Given im not a particular fan of sports, especially boxing, I wasn't expecting a great deal of this but I reckon I enjoyed it more than I perhaps imagined I might because the majority of the film isn't set in the ring, as it were and instead it concentrated on Rocky's life outside the ring, his clearly low-ish standing and it shows how he did what he could to try and raise himself above that.It is a bit cheesy but for the most part, its a reasonably solid watch and I respect that.

However, with that being said, this film has a heart, soul, and passion thanks to its moments of vulnerability, character bonding, environment establishment, and music montages. Special highlights I must acknowledge go to Burgess Meredith delivering a brilliant performance and Sylvester Stallone's solo writing contribution to the entire film....and yes, he is the one and only Rocky Balboa.",

The build-up and nostalgic vibes with excellent moments and a terrific dramatic end made it a great experience, even though it started out slowly. You nearly feel every punch in the well-staged training and combat scenes, which make excellent use of camera angles. The film has amazing music, the theme song in particular, and gorgeous cinematography, particularly during the training scenes where Rocky sprints through the streets. The characters' highs and lows in relation to Rocky were brilliantly displayed. It's still one of the greatest in the series since it's a strong character study and an entertaining underdog tale.",
