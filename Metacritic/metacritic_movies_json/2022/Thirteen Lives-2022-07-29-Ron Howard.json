Faced with insurmountable odds, a team of the world’s most skilled and experienced divers – uniquely able to navigate the maze of flooded, narrow cave tunnels – join with Thai forces and more than 10,000 volunteers to attempt a harrowing rescue of the twelve boys and their coach. With impossibly high stakes and the entire world watching, the group embarks on their most challenging dive yet, showcasing the limitlessness of the human spirit in the process.… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Thirteen Lives is a film that truly orients itself around a grounded cinematic approach to story, one largely told without big, grandstanding emotional speeches but instead focused on visually capturing subjectivity, demonstrating tension, and highlighting the life-or-death weight of the characters' choices.utm_campaign=clip",
    "As scripted, documentary-style fact-based dramas go, it doesn’t get much better than this.",
    "Thirteen Lives is not an exhibition of spectacle in scale or execution. It neither skirts over details too quickly nor goes too deep into technical aspects, arming the audience with enough to know how much is at stake and why. It’s an examination and dramatization of adversity and the complexity, strength, and resilience of the human spirit, which perfectly draws characterizations that avoid hammy tropes and tired stereotypes.",
    "We are left with a properly entertaining drama that gets across the technical details with great efficiency. A good job of work by a reliable Hollywood professional.",
    "Despite the fact that we all know the outcome, and that it’s the third film in as many years to tell the story, Ron Howard’s account of the drama is compulsively watchable and breathlessly tense.",
    "Luckily, we have the benefit of being able to read the future even as we watch Thirteen Lives, and that leaves us free to enjoy Howard’s crackerjack storytelling skills, not to mention the picture’s bracing, casually heroic lead performances.",
    "In Thirteen Lives, Ron Howard sheds the spectacle of the 2018 Thai soccer team cave rescue by recreating the impossible logistics, choices, and dangers with intimacy and chilling claustrophobia.",
    "A story of overwhelming humanitarian sacrifice.",
    "Howard’s film is a paean to the courage and canniness of the seasoned non-professional: subterranean heroism has never looked so down-to-earth.",
    "All too often, in life and in cinema, systems are shown as working simply to oppress: Thirteen Lives reminds us that communal acts can be what literally save us.",
    "Howard finds the heart in this story, and the perfect places to pluck the heartstrings. It’s an emotional movie, given a real-time “What we don’t know yet” urgency by Nicholson’s script, and a sort of awestruck “Look what these 5,000 people did just to save these children” credulity by one of Hollywood’s greatest “movies with heart” filmmakers.",
    "Howard's no-frills approach to Thirteen Lives is what makes it such a success.",
    "Thirteen Lives is a solid achievement, technically and dramatically, using a ticktock timeline and periodically superimposing on-screen maps of the miles-long cave system to build tension. Like its protagonists, it isn’t flashy but is all business. It gets the job done with a minimum of histrionics, yet a mountain of suspense.",
    "Thirteen Lives deserves to be seen. The only question is whether audiences will be up for it. I saw it on a huge screen and had to occasionally remind myself that if it got really overwhelming, I could always close my eyes. It’s that intense.",
    "Ron Howard’s claustrophobically intense and captivating “Thirteen Lives” is one of those movies where you find yourself marveling at the daunting logistics involved in re-creating one of the most famed and complex rescue efforts in recent history—but with an excessive running time of 147 minutes, by the time the story wraps up, we’re almost too exhausted to fully appreciate what we’ve just experienced.",
    "It’s a film that has some obvious parallels to Howard’s Apollo 13, a docudrama about a small group of endangered people in a claustrophobic space, with worldwide media attention on a rescue effort and a happy ending, thanks to technological ingenuity, courage, and collective effort.",
    "The film is a welcome return to form for Howard, containing all the makings of a competently crafted crowd-pleasing drama.",
    "If you’re looking for an engaging-enough rehashing of a riveting true story, by all means watch Thirteen Lives. Just don’t expect it to present you with anything that you haven’t seen in the long list of survival flicks already out there.",
    "Although it’s extremely competent, it fails to add a new perspective to the story, or a distinctive approach to its telling.",
    "This is a pragmatic recounting of a nigh-impossible mission: first, to find the trapped boys, and harder still, to swim them out.",
    "By the end of the story, the film’s aims are clear: to show what an absolute miracle the rescue was, and to honor the extraordinary cooperation and selflessness of those who came to help. Yes, that’s inspirational. But it also quietly counters a Hollywood history besotted with lone rangers and mavericks. Everyone matters.",
    "Thirteen Lives may be a vivid rescue procedural first and foremost, but it’s also a testament to the guardian spirit possible in any of us.",
    "The heart of the movie is the discussions among the divers and, even more, the scenes in the caves. Simply as a technical achievement, the underground and underwater filming is highly impressive.",
    "In attempting to dramatize their harrowing story in the film Thirteen Lives...the director doesn’t make quick, from-the-gut decisions the way that the intrepid team did. Instead, he takes a chill ride on the Lazy River.",
    "When Howard focuses on the head-scratching mechanics of the mission itself, Thirteen Lives excels – and its many claustrophobic underwater scenes likely play excellently inside the confines of a darkened theatre. But by the time we’re in pure rescue mode, it is almost too late. What should be the highest of high-stakes dramas arrives with a drippy thud.",
    "Howard honours the collective heroism above all else, resulting in a well-crafted procedural that’s a little impersonal. Like the brave men who ultimately saved the day, Thirteen Lives gets the job done.",
    "If you stick with it through the somewhat plodding first half of this overly long retelling, you’ll be rewarded with a rousing final hour.",
    "All told, Thirteen Lives is a solid and compelling watch that stands as a testament to people's resilient spirits.",
    "For a film about feats of next-level bravery, Thirteen Lives is a little too cautious to really soar.",
    "The tension of Thirteen Lives is implicit, and ramps up like a vice – how long until all these people’s luck finally runs out? But I do wonder whether all this soberness has prevented a good film from being an extraordinary one.",
    "The movie works, but there has to be a more original way in to the Thai cave rescue story, other than through the main entrance, high-fiving its heroes at every step. For starters, it might have spent a little more time on the “Thirteen Lives” on the line.",
    "It’s a restrained rendering of the events, a drama that plays, at times, like a documentary. But if Howard’s decision to spotlight the Thai characters in this harrowing narrative is a sound one, there’s an unfamiliar stiffness and self-consciousness in the director’s approach — an inability to marry the fast-paced, no-nonsense heroics that are his strong suit with more emotionally textured storytelling. The resulting awkwardness prevents the movie, for all the surreal tension and bravery it depicts, from feeling urgent or surprising.",
    "For its first half, Thirteen Lives feels like it is treading water, waiting for its big final act. Thankfully, the second half is a riveting depiction of a daring, foolhardy, inspired rescue.",
    "You can appreciate the effort, but this falls just short of doing justice to the emotional stakes and claustrophobic terror of the traumatic events themselves.",
    "[A] decent retelling of an amazing true-life story.",
    "Told with no frills, less personality, and just enough quiet dignity to sustain itself for 18 days (or 147 minutes), Howard’s serviceable “Thirteen Lives” is a far cry from the kind of souped-up spectacle some of his Hollywood contemporaries might create out of this material. And yet, its let the story speak for itself approach feels misjudged in the aftermath of a documentary so rich with big personalities, knotted with stomach-churning suspense, and shadowed by a lingering sense of ethical ambivalence.",
    "Avoiding excessively heightened melodrama, Thirteen Lives doesn’t substitute it with much that one couldn’t already find in the copious amount of available coverage of the real-life incident.",
    "Neither the divers nor kids, government officials nor families and volunteers really come into focus, staying as murky as the miles of submerged cave.",
    "Ron Howard’s latest directorial effort is a tedious, mediocre retelling of the June, 2018 incident where 12 Thai adolescents and their soccer coach were trapped in a flooded cave for 18 days.",
    "Howard’s film winds up as a rote retread, transitioning from headline news to big-screen snooze."

It was an inspiring story that moved peopleFor 18 days in 2018, the world's attention was focused on the attempted rescue of 12 young soccer players and their coach who were trapped inside the flooded Tham Luang cavern in northern Thailand. It was an inspiring story that moved people around the globe, and director Ron Howard has now brought it to life in a technically masterful re-creation. However, as capably made as this picture is, its overlong 2:29:00 runtime can try the patience of viewers at times, especially when some of it sequences become drawn out and repetitive. This is by no means intended to diminish the uplifting nature of the story or the adeptness with which it has been produced cinematically, but, given the emphasis on the picture's technical merits, this approach to telling the tale tends to shortchange its tremendous emotional impact. A journalistically styled by-the-numbers take on telling a story like this is fine, but I was hoping for something a little more heartfelt in light of the miracle this epically heroic yarn turned out to be. \"Thirteen Lives\" definitely earns a passing grade, but I can't help but wonder what it might have been with a little more emotion – and a lot more heart-tugging.",

Didn't tell us about the lives of the divers or soccer team before hand. Even though the British accents from Viggo and Colin were basically half Australian, they seemed good enough for the job but they were not directed enough to give an impactful performance and all the interactions between the divers fell flat. The underwater and cave diving footage was quite well done but still even that could have been done with more precision as there was never enough context given as to the situation inside and out of the cave and there was not enough clarity of which diver you were watching or the ultimate goal of what the diver was supposed to be doing.You also never truly felt the claustrophobia of what the dive would have been like as the water was mostly crystal clear with the scary sections basically amounting to getting stuck, and you never truly felt the fear, even when the Navy seal drowns because the pacing was off and there was no music to accompany it. It also seemed like they got through the cave too quickly the first time which made all subsequent expeditions feel less impactful. The constant heads up display of the location inside the cave didn't do anything to help us understand the distances and time involved, and more than that actually took you out of the realism. The way Nat Geo did this was far more insightful. They could have used aerial shots of the mountains or CGI of the cave to show how far it was for them to go but all they give you is a white line with a red dot. They could easily have fit in showing us the boys go into the cave which would have showed us how big the cave us and given them a chance to introduce them as actual characters.I will give points that the final sequence had the anxiety levels up, however when the divers come out at the end, two of the three Thai divers come out together and then the last after and it seemed like only two had come out and then everyone was celebrating while you were left without closure, which made it so the most crucial part of the film - the sigh of relief - never comes. After this, the movie abruptly ends with the boys waving to their mothers in the hospital. We don't see Rick Stanton meet his wife or see the divers get knighted or the Australian diver return home.Overall the movie is a missed opportunity to expand beyond what the documentary told us. None of the characters are fleshed out, there is no main character, no supporting cast. Just a bunch of actors who fill in for real people, all participating in the aimless goal of retelling a story that was already told more succinctly and in far more detail and impact before in the National Geographic documentary. Apparently a film called 'the Cave' was already made in 2019 and by watching the trailer shows the divers lives before hand. I would watch that or the Nat Geo documentary if you want a more detailed and interesting depiction.",
