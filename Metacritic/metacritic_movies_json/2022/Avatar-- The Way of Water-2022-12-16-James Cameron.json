  "summary": "Set more than a decade after the events of the first film, Avatar: The Way of Water begins to tell the story of the Sully family (Jake, Neytiri, and their kids), the trouble that follows them, the lengths they go to keep each other safe, the battles they fight to stay alive,  and the tragedies they endure.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "There’s an energy here that has been sadly absent from too many recent Hollywood blockbusters. For 2022, The Way of Water may not be the most intricately made or intellectually rigorous motion picture, but it exemplifies what “cinematic” means today.",
    "Avatar: The Way Of Water not only delivers upon everything its predecessor established, but advances them in ways gleaming and ocean-deep, through the eyes and heart of a cinematic storyteller with a passionate and well-documented love of the sea.",
    "Spending more than a decade pining for Pandora was worth it. Cameron has delivered the grandest movie since, well, “Avatar,” and with an over-three-hour runtime that never sags. What better way for struggling cinemas to regain their footing than with a gargantuan film that so celebrates the glory of the big screen?",
    "James Cameron has surfaced with a cosmic marine epic that only he could make: eccentric, soulful, joyous, dark and very, very blue. Yes, he’s still leagues ahead of the pack.",
    "For now, the only thing that matters is that after 13 years of being a punchline, “going back to Pandora” just became the best deal on Earth for the price of a movie ticket.",
    "The movie's overt themes of familial love and loss, its impassioned indictments of military colonialism and climate destruction, are like a meaty hand grabbing your collar; it works because they work it.",
    "The final battles in The Way of Water are rousing, but they’re also feats of geography, astonishing in how they manage to keep the audience focused on a huge ensemble of characters who are jumping between various locations.",
    "Like the first movie, the technical wizardry won me over and (again, having just rewatched the first movie) the story is deeper and richer.",
    "Cameron makes you care for this place, for its residents, for its wildlife, and most especially for its whale analogs - a major element of the story, one that curtly reminds us that our own cetaceans may well be our intellectual equals.",
    "Pandora remains one of the most amazing worlds we’ve ever seen on the big screen.",
    "There is something comforting about the fact that we are capable of intense, collective cultural whiplash. That “who cares?” can turn to uncynical amazement in an instant. Is that the magic of the movies? Of continuing to push the bounds of the big screen experience? Of betting big on weird-sounding stories about giant blue environmentalists instead of superheroes every so often? Maybe it’s just the magic of James Cameron.",
    "Cameron invites viewers into this fully realized world with so many striking images and phenomenally rendered action scenes that everything else fades away.",
    "The Way of Water is the kind of tremendously entertaining, spectacularly ambitious, not-a-little-bit-silly epic that only James Cameron can, and should, make.",
    "James Cameron has done it again with Avatar: The Way of Water, a state-of-the-art exercise that rekindles that sense of wonder and demands to be seen by anyone with lingering interest in watching movies in theaters.",
    "The Way of Water’s true achievement is that it looks like nothing else but the first Avatar, unparalleled in detail and scale, a devouring enterprise all to itself. Watching The Way of Water can at times feel astonishing, as if the brain gapes at the sheer amount of physical data present in every frame, incapable of consuming it, but longing to keep up.",
    "This is not just content you ingest. Avatar: The Way of Water is a movie you bodily inhabit for three stunning hours. We come to this place for magic, indeed.",
    "In three hours, Cameron turned this Avatar nonbeliever into a viewer who can’t wait for a new sequel every two years. Avatar: The Way of Water truly feels like a fresh start for this series, as Cameron and his team address the weaknesses of the first film, improving the script and characters, while also creating one of the most extraordinary experiences one can have at the theaters.",
    "If the Avatar universe is going to be James Cameron’s preferred delivery method for visual spectacle on this scale going forward, then, let’s face it — by then, we’re all going to be itching for our next trip to Pandora.",
    "I definitely enjoyed Avatar: The Way of Water much more than the first. Its message of family and the portrayal of a strong father and mother protecting their children is refreshing.",
    "[Cameron] may not be a great artist, or a visionary, but in its look, and its feeling for family, this behemoth enterprise still has an ardent, cornball grandeur to it. I look forward to “Avatar 3.”",
    "Weigh the flimsy story against the eye-popping, jaw-dropping, shoot-the-works visuals that fill the screen to bursting and the choice is clear: James Cameron’s 3-D sequel to his biggest hit is the ultimate in-theater thrill ride. You’ve never seen anything like it in your life.",
    "The Way of Water makes clear that Cameron no longer needs to leave the confines of this (virtual) extrasolar moon in the Alpha Centauri system to create something closer to the heart. He can bend Pandora to his will, and now he’s bent it to make what might be his most earnest film to date.",
    "Watching The Way of Water, one rolls their eyes only to realize they’re welling with tears. One stretches and shifts in their seat before accepting, with a resigned and happy plop, that they could watch yet another hour of Cameron’s preservationist epic. Lucky for us—lucky even for the culture, maybe—that at least a few more of those are on their way.",
    "Avatar: The Way of Water is a clear improvement on its predecessor and, though its story isn’t breaking new ground, its jaw-dropping visuals make this an irresistible return to Pandora.",
    "‘The most dangerous thing about Pandora,’ someone muses sagely at one point, ‘is that you grow to love it too much.’ Jim Cameron disagrees. He can’t love this place enough – and it’s infectious.",
    "The Way of Water is like its predecessor: sincere to the point of being brash, wide-armed and open-hearted toward the world it loves and vengefully, comically violent toward the people who arrive to destroy that world. It’s a better movie than the first outing because Cameron lets things get weirder, wilder.",
    "Unlike its predecessor though, you won’t forget this experience in a hurry.",
    "In terms of narrative sophistication and even more so dialogue, this $350 million sequel is almost as basic as its predecessor, even feeble at times. But the expanded, bio-diverse world-building pulls you in, the visual spectacle keeps you mesmerized, the passion for environmental awareness is stirring and the warfare is as visceral and exciting as any multiplex audience could desire.",
    "James Cameron mobilizes on all fronts for an imperfect but imposing blockbuster: dazzling, supersized, rippled with currents of sincere feeling.",
    "Cameron leans all the way into manic mayhem, smash-cutting from one outrageous image to the next. The final act of this movie shows off a freeing attitude he’s never fully embraced before.",
    "When Cameron’s film calms down, and the stunning imagery that cinematographer Russell Carpenter (“Titanic”) has created with the film’s enormous visual-effects team can linger for a while, the imagination and scope of Avatar: The Way of Water can occasionally feel quite magical.",
    "Director James Cameron's epic sequel has a lot to pack in: it's a decent sci-fi blockbuster, a visual effects masterclass, and the best nature documentary you'll ever see.",
    "A work of blockbuster auteurism, Avatar: The Way of Water wildly, weirdly expends massive resources on a vision at once generic and bizarrely idiosyncratic, for better and for worse.",
    "While The Way of Water could have easily lost an hour from its three-hour-plus running time, it would have been a shame to lose its most magic moments, the stuff that makes it different.",
    "As with most Cameron blockbusters, “The Way of Water” has a way of pulling you in, surrounding you with gorgeous, violent chaos and finishing with a quick rinse to get the remnants of its teeny-tiny plot out of your eyes by the final credits.",
    "It’s a gorgeous and stunning thing to look at, with awesome sights of underwater fauna, and the new movie is an emotionally charged outing that again dips into themes of colonization while adding environmental issues and relatable family drama.",
    "For all the genuine thrills provided by its pioneering pageantry, Way of Water ultimately leaves you with a soul-nagging query: What price entertainment?",
    "Many have observed that the first “Avatar,” despite its outsize box-office, didn’t leave much of a cultural footprint. The second is more of the same. It may be a visual buffet, but the pickings are merely eye candy.",
    "You can’t say The Way of Water doesn’t give you your money’s worth, especially in the visual department. This thing’s got enough eye candy to give you ocular diabetes.",
    "In Avatar: The Way of Water, the director James Cameron pulls you down so deep, and sets you so gently adrift, that at times you don’t feel like you’re watching a movie so much as floating in one.",
    "The Way of Water is overlong and stretched thin on story, but the Avatar sequel is beautiful, with lush world-building and characters that add depth.",
    "Avatar: The Way of Water overstays its welcome but it sure is thrilling when it wants to be.",
    "This movie has the greatest ratio of zone-out time to narrative comprehension I’ve ever experienced.",
    "Cameron’s staging of action sequences remains unparalleled, and that buys some goodwill, but by the end of the movie, I was left with Peggy’s Lee’s immortal question: “Is that all there is?”",
    "Its beautiful, digitally-realized other-worldly visuals are eye-popping, so crystalline as to be disorienting. You lose track of where the screen ends and the tactile, physical cinema you’re watching it in begins.",
    "Its plot is hacky; it’s got some really clunky characters; the dialogue is, at times, unthinkably stupid. (“The way of water connects all things” is the kind of line that sounds profound until you really think about it.) But this new Avatar filled an awe-shaped void in my heart, and for that, I thank James Cameron.",
    "As an experience, Avatar: The Way of Water is second to none. In terms of the storytelling, though, James Cameron has fallen into the exact same pitfalls as he did on the first visit to Pandora.",
    "His passion is infectious and his enthusiasm for environmental causes commendable, but the movie’s metaphysical and sociological aspirations sometimes come off as cringe-inducingly similar to those that might be expressed by a white lady running a healing-crystal shop in a seaside town.",
    "I’m curious, and inclined — as I was in 2009 — to give this grand, muddled project the benefit of the doubt. Cameron’s ambitions are as sincere as they are self-contradictory. He wants to conquer the world in the name of the underdog, to celebrate nature by means of the most extravagant artifice, and to make everything new feel old again.",
    "The Way Of Water’s resplendent presentation couldn’t be more breathtaking — the drama unfolding inside that world isn’t always as masterfully rendered.",
    "Avatar: The Way of Water is both more extravagant and dorkier than Avatar, which was pretty dorky to begin with.",
    "At its height, it feels exhilarating. But not all the way through. Cameron, in \"The Way of Water,\" remains a fleet and exacting classical popcorn storyteller, but oh, the story he’s telling! The script he has co-written is a string of serviceable clichés that give the film the domestic adventure-thriller spine it needs, but not anything more than that.",
    "Cameron, at this point, seems interested less in being an artist than a cinematic frontiersman. That’s the point of The Way of Water – it’s not about what the film has to offer us now, but what it tells us about the future.",
    "It’s still more of a spectacle than a movie. But as spectacles go, it’s a big one. And with more elements of an actual film creeping in here and there, who knows? By the time we get to the fifth one, we might have some actual cinema on our hands.",
    "It’s a technological grand slam and a thematic sacrifice bunt.",
    "The film is more than three hours long, some of it dangerously close to dawdling; not until the final third does Cameron apply the whip and remind us that, in the choreographing of action sequences, he remains unsurpassed.",
    "Watching Avatar: The Way of Water is like binging a season of television all at once, not because you don’t want to stop, but because you know that if you do stop you’ll never pick it back up again.",
    "The action in “The Way of Water” is ultimately overwhelming, betraying an uncomfortable truth about Cameron: He might preach environmentalism and balance, calling on Indigenous peoples for their gentle worldviews and material culture. But at heart, he’s just as aggressive and all-commanding as the bad guys he portrays with such oorah swagger.",
    "So yes: Wow! Gasp! There are some really pretty pictures here. But wow! Gasp! The story is really pretty … stupid.",
    "For all its sententious grandiosity and metaphorical politics, “The Way of Water” is a regimented and formalized excursion to an exclusive natural paradise that its select guests fight tooth and nail to keep for themselves. The movie’s bland aesthetics and banal emotions turn it into the Club Med of effects-driven extravaganzas.",
    "A lumbering, humourless, tech-driven damp squib of a movie, this long-awaited (or dreaded?) sequel to one of the highest grossing films of all time builds upon the mighty flaws of its predecessor, delivering a patience-testing fantasy dirge that is longer, uglier and (amazingly) even more clumsily scripted than its predecessor, blending trite characterisation with sub-Roger Dean 70s album-cover designs and thunderously underwhelming action sequences. In water.",
    "No doubt millions will be have no difficulty ferreting out the emotional core and propelling The Way of Water to box office success. But the indulgence of it all causes one to yearn for the raw, propulsive action of Cameron’s first two Terminator movies.",
    "The film not only rejects any criticisms – and there are many! – of the first film, but doubles down on them, delivering an even more hokily disjointed narrative, ramping up the sentimental cut-aways of human/animal camaraderie, and ramming unearned, broad-brush emotion down the viewer’s throat like so much salty popcorn.",
    "The stage is set for a rip-roaring adventure, a space opera sprinkled with debates on the ethics of colonialism and assimilation. But then Cameron takes the film in a new direction - and The Way of Water becomes a damp squib.",
    "And what do we find aside from the high-tech visual superstructure? The floatingly bland plot is like a children’s story without the humour; a YA story without the emotional wound; an action thriller without the hard edge of real excitement.",
    "As the credits roll on one of the most spectacular and unengaging films of the year, The Way of Water’s vision is as clear as mud. As Cameron has become more fascinated with the technology of storytelling, it seems he’s become less so by the actual storytelling.",
    "Avatar: The Way of Water is a one-hour story rattling around in a 192-minute bag.",
    "For all its world-building sprawl, The Way of Water is a horizon-narrowing experience – the sad sight of a great filmmaker reversing up a creative cul-de-sac."

We are light years away from a masterpiece, and as soon as the social enthusiasm wanes, we will lucidly begin to agree with the press that demolished this film.

This movie isn't bad, but just not worth waiting 14 years for what feels like the original Avatar, but just made to capitalize on the highest grossing film of all time. The runtime may make you believe that it's full of character development, world building, and badass action, but instead drones on nothing for the entire middle section, but may entertain most people based on spectacle alone. Avatar: The Way of Water just feels like a cash grab with much visual detail and action near the end, but lacks in writing, pacing, story, characters, and pretty much any other aspect.",

But on the other hand his motive was better here, revenge and a kinda sorta son. It feels more personal here which I like.There’s a lot of moments that were supposed to be impactful that just didn’t land. In the first when the humans burn the whole giant tree and the Navi scream crying we feel it. The closest thing to that here is one where a pseudo whale dies which sucked but I mean dramatic music was playing while it was broad daylight and there was laughing and no negative reaction so it was hard to care if only the music cares if that makes sense. The only death is the least developed character. Four kids was too many, there wasn’t enough time to develop them all. In three hours. A lot of the arcs get halfway done and then just… stop. Which leads me to the main problem.Sequel bait. The villain lives, arcs only begin, ends on a cliffhanger, the fight of the movie isn’t even done. It’s not it’s own movie. It’s a part one. Pros: it’s pretty and the action sequences are cool and the acting is great and the soundtrack is great and I saw it in 3D which was better than I expected.

But even then, this film was underwhelming sequel. The visuals were first rate and if you go to the movie for THAT reason, you will probably enjoy it. However, there is ZERO reason this film needed to be three hours long. NONE. The plot with Colonel Quaritch being brought back in an Avatar body was a good idea, and this film did next to nothing with it. The Sully family to me is the biggest offender to this story. His children, (whom I can’t remember their names because the film cares so little for me to remember them) take up and extreme amount of the run time and to be honest, a lot of what they are involved in, was simply not engaging. There are also several logical fallacies on display. How, if the humans wanted indigenous populations gone, they clearly landed enough people on Pandora to do it this time around. And yet, the whole film is the small group of Marine Avatars, hunting down Jake Sully and his family, making the whole film a simple revenge plot. There is NO NEED to make that kind of plot, three hours long. There are entire scenes and even plot threads that could have been cut that would have made this a much tighter, better overall film. How many shots does a film REALLY need of characters just sitting in awe of something or swimming through the water?? The first film, for what it was, was FAR more engaging story wise than this film.",

It's beautiful and gorgeous when it comes to the mocap and graphics, but fails when it comes to the story and characters that are presented in this movie. Being a huge Avatar fan with my family, we had a lot of expectations for those 13 years, and after seeing the movie, we were all a bit happy and disappointed (again, mixed feelings).The story feels a bit generic and recycled. It's the same old \"humans bad and greedy while poor aliens are innocent and nice\", and it seems like James Cameron sorta lost his touch. There are also many plot holes and errors in the story that make you wonder if some of it was even proof read by someone.Graphically wise, this is by far the best looking movie that I have ever seen so far in my life! The way how the models were textured and simulated with the wild life (cgi) blows your mind away wondering how they even pulled it off.At the end of the day, Avatar 2 is more of a \"eye candy\" graphical showcase than a good story. While Avatar 1 presented many cool ideas and concepts about Pandora, Avatar 2 just feels like it recycled all its creatures and natives into a \"but what if they were underwater?\". Do I recommend this movie? Sure, I guess. Def a good movie to go watching with friends or family and have a fun time, but as an Avatar fan, I think I am starting to lose hope for this movie series, and that worries me...",

There a moments of levity as you'd expect, but what Cameron chose to bring forth to us was sort of a letdown even from what a lot of straight-to-dvd disney sequels bring to the table.  But all in all, it's a swift time. It has it's wonder, and enamourment. That's it's strength. But it's a miss in giving us something truly emotional or scarce.

I think that's the target demographic. I found it a OK popcorn flick with an expanded cast, with a lot of the focus on the children of the protagonist of the previous film. True to its name the plot is very water focused. But can basically be distilled down to \"Whaling bad.\" Characters and plot elements are simplistic, and the CG and invented alien biome is largely expected to cover for that. Similarly a cast of A list talent largely vanishes into the blue creatures that inhabit this world. Edie Falco does a stand out job in a minor role. Other than that it feels like a midquel. Doesn't start much, doesn't resolve much. Its long enough and slow enough younger kids do (and did in my theater) get bored. Since it was the big theater film of a weak xmas season, it made lots of money.

I can safely say that CGI has never looked this good in a movie before, especially when you consider the meandering quality of CGI in recent Disney produced films. This movie, without a doubt, does have incredible visuals; however…the rest of this long awaited Sci-Fi epic is fairly inconsistent. The film is over three hours long yet it still had some pretty noticeable pacing issues, with certain plot points needing more context and time to grow and others not making much sense at all. The Way of Water also has a pretty inconsistent plot that a lot of the time makes the film feel like its two entirely different movies, with neither being able fully tell a great story. I would recommend seeing The Way of Water despite my criticisms; if only for the revolutionary visuals, pretty decent performances, and a few really incredible scenes that both thematically and cinematically blew me away. I do look forward to future entries in this franchise and hope that more context and detail is added to the overall multi-film long story that Director James Cameron wants to tell. It will be interesting to see where these movies will go in the future, that's for sure.",

Listen, why are all13 years?  The writers must have spent all their time shoving bananas in each others **** as opposed to actually writing a decent script that didn't have some sort of contrivance or invented conflict every twenty minutes.  Listen, why are all you important plot characters in a sequence that will incite an action scene or create some sort of drama or invite some kind of conflict every chance you get?  Why won't you just listen to the other main characters?  Oh right, because this is a self-indulgent pet project born out of James Cameron's enormous ego and insipid usage of the exact same plot mechanics in every film he's ever made.  The narrative being a completely unintelligible mess is I suppose also the best Cameron can do with all the money and computer graphics in the world.  So much for that then.What troubles me about Avatar 2, is that this is where large productions are going.  These goofy stupid cartoon characters jumping around with explosions with no real emotional core or elements that make them relatable in any way.  Its the equivalent of Wily coyote catching the roadrunnner, but all of a sudden the roadrunner pulls out a photo of his roadrunner wife, his roadrunner kids, his roadrunner investment portfolio, retirement plan and his 401k.  As if we as the audience are supposed to suddenly sympathize with this caricature of a bird that happens to run too fast for its intended predator- which is the whole joke by the way.  Here, the joke is the scenes where the writers have written themselves into a corner and have no idea how to create real, moving, raw emotion with their dumb looking 12 feet tall blue cat people that chatter, hoot, holler and screech like a pack of very social Bonobo monkeys.  They also stick their tongues out, which I found hilariously insulting to actual indigenous people.  It was like watching Disney's Pocahontas, in fact the Water chief guy kind of looked like Pocahontas's DAD to be honest.  I certainly laughed and threw my arms up a lot while watching this.  Its whiny, its preachy, its all recycled crap from the first movie.  Everyone strangely disappears during the final fight for some reason, then all of the characters that we have had barely any time to actually get to know have a big group hug and solve all their problems.  Wow.  Amazing.  No kissing?  No embracing?  No romance?  Just the equivalent of pre-teens giving one another googily eyes from across the room?  Are you kidding me with this Barny the magic dinosaur garbage they are presenting as some sort of action packed romp that will change your life baloney?

Additionally, the plot felt repetitive and unoriginal, as it seemed like a copy-paste of the first movie with the discovery of a new part of Pandora. Also very little new things are introduced for a 3 hours long movie, we already discovered the Navi, Pandora, the ability to use Avatars and the bad guys in the first movie. The use of both 48fps and 24fps scenes also detracted from the film, as the mixing of the two frame rates made it feel like a poorly optimized game.

Never trust those who cry masterpiece in the throes of hype and excitement: it is a decent entertainment film, but it certainly does not surpass Avatar 1, neither in plot, nor in music, nor in \"generational impact\" as they say in the commercials. The script certainly seems a bit too didactic, redundant, and often seems to want to explicitly tell the viewer what emotion to feel at any given moment. The \"show don't tell\" process falters a bit. On the other hand, some of the implied (and thus only visual) symbolism is good, even if it is few.References to Mother Earth, spiritualism and immanence are the same as in the first film. The TechnologyVsNature and Colonizer-Indigenous debate does not change one iota; in this sense it is a repetition of the ethical messages of the first Avatar but with more ... water. The only new theme, which was not dealt with in the previous film, is that of the family and the union and separation among its members.I hope it is understood that I am not challenging the simplicity of the plot, as many excellent films have a simple plot that is well conveyed and in tune with the images. I am contesting the entire solidity and coherence of the plot, the characters, their motivations, and their jokes. Jake is a shadow, he is one-dimensional, he only talks about protection; his wife is a no-show. The Villain is a speck (in addition to being potentially eternal, considering that his data is saved and you can recreate him in a Na'Vi body whenever you want) and he is motivated to kill Jake in such a surreal way that he looks like an antagonist from 1980s blockbusters, far removed from our 2022 where even in the poorest movies the Enemy is more multidimensional and more alive than our poor Marine in Avatar 2.",

A CGI tech demo for a PlayStation 6 rather than a serious movie that seriously tests your patience towards the end. Yes, it looks visually very good throughout, but it's overkill - CGI is at its' best when it compliments the movie, not when it IS the movie.The sole appeal is to see this in 3D/IMAX or whatever for the visual spectacle. There's zero reason to watch this at home or even on a standard cinema screen, because narratively this is as shallow as a puddle.I found the original Avatar OK. I thought it showed promise with what could be done with technology, and I went into this one genuinely open-minded, wondering if Cameron could fulfil that promise. He hasn't. He didn't even come close, and I hope this is the end of the big budged CGI adventure in Hollywood.",

The 3D was some of the best I've ever seen. It was extremely beautiful and really created a lot of depth and some good pop out. You know like the little particle effects right in front of your face is pretty amazing. Unfortunately a big problem with this movie is the story. It's very similar to the first movie but you get less people in it. The first movie I felt more connected to the characters because they kept going back and forth between showing them as people and showing them as Avatars. Here it's mostly just avatars and a repeat of the first movie with the same villain but as a avatar. And it just felt like a stale story that we seen before just in water instead of the jungle. The new characters I didn't really care about and wasn't emotionally attached to them. I think the story really should have took a different direction instead of just repeating the same plot from the first movie practically. When it comes to 3D movies this is not even top 5 on my list. I think the first Avatar movie is much better. I left the movie theater very disappointed. But my expectations were pretty high so it's all going to depend on your expectations. Don't expect some incredible story or something, that's not what you're going to get. But it does have some good messaging when it comes to protecting your family, wild life and creatures in the ocean. But it just didn't hit home with me emotionally and that's why it ultimately doesn't get a better rating from me. The 3D is probably a 10/10, definitely a 9/10. But a movie needs to be much more than good 3D and I love 3D movies. Overall I think this is pretty disappointing work by James Cameron when it comes to the story. You think he could come up with a better story and plot than this.. I guess he's just not that creative. If a movie is boring, too long and doesn't grab you emotionally its a huge problem and it was for this movie. If anyone says this movie is woke I don't really agree with them and I'm against woke trash. There was one woke female character who's one of the only humans you see in the movie but it's only a few small scenes. The problem with this movie isn't wokeness it's the plot and story. It's the fact that it doesn't emotionally grab you and the characters don't emotionally grab you. It feels like a National Geographic documentary in 3D. It's not even a good popcorn flick because again it was pretty boring. Everything in this movie that was cool we already seen before in the previous movie but in the jungle instead of the ocean. And if you want to see awesome 3D underwater just go watch Aquaman in 3D I think it's better in a lot of ways. Avatar: The Way of Water is definitely by far the most beautiful 3D National Geographic documentary you will ever see but it's not a good movie. I don't even really consider it a movie with that boring plot that we seen already. It's a recycled plot with the same villain just with water and creatures in the ocean instead of the jungle. And again this is probably the most important point. This movie doesn't show the humans much at all and that's a big reason why I didn't feel a connection with the characters. It's very important to show both and that's why the first movie works better. And you can't just have the same basic plot and expect people to accept it as some incredible movie.",

You can't objectively watch this movie and say it isn't one of the most stunning visual and cinematographic experiences you ever had, if not the best one.The level of detail Cameron put in this is actually unbelievable. If you put your attention on the world building, on the amount of credible alien-animal creatures he created, on the scenery he imagined, you will be stunned.Talking about the plot, it may be simple (just as some of the highest rated movies ever), but it improved a lot from the first one. Besides, if you dig just a little bit deeper, you will notice a lot of symbolism, mythology and sub-plots which develop throughout the movie.During its 3 hour running time, it touches themes such as the strength of family values, the fallacies of group ideologies and traditions, the psychological toll of being different and the ever changing human-nature relationship. It makes you fall in love with Pandora, and in return, to our Planet.You can really tell Cameron and his team spent years not only researching ancient human tribes dynamics and mythology to make the movie ones realistic, but also creating new recording techniques that will improve the cinema industry from now on.Everything you see seems real: there's no distinction between CGI and reality.
