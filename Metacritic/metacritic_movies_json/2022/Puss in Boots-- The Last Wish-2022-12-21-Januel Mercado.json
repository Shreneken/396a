  "critic_reviews": [
    "It’s a perfect package of whimsy, sass and sweetness.",
    "“The Last Wish” has no qualms about testing the expectations of its young audience while delivering a freewheeling tale about appreciating the nine lives we already have.",
    "It is not only one of the best animated films of the year, but it's one of DreamWorks' best, and one that will strike a chord with moviegoers of all ages. It's equal parts exciting and hilarious as well as earnest, it never feels like it is talking down to anyone.",
    "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish mixes stunning animation with a poignant, surprisingly mature story to deliver the Shrek franchise's answer to Logan we didn't know we needed.",
    "What could have easily been a hairball of half-digested nostalgia is transformed into a mature and cat-ivating story that positively purrs.",
    "Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is one of cinema’s biggest surprises of the year.",
    "This Shrek spin-off is a breezily entertaining DreamWorks animation that harnesses the familiar appeal of the self-aggrandising feline (Antonio Banderas), while also adopting a distinctive and original graphic visual style.",
    "The Last Wish is visually gorgeous with an attention to detail you might not expect given it’s a sequel to a spin-off of a two-decade-old film.",
    "The Last Wish is better than it has any right to be. From charming animation that combines digital and analog sensibilities and takes cues from fairytale books to performances that are pitch-perfect, it works! It would be a mistake to write it off as a late-in-the-game sequel or nostalgia cash-grab when it’s clear there’s true craftsmanship behind the work.",
    "There is a lot to like here, not least Ray Winstone’s Papa Bear. The forests are Skittle-coloured. The set pieces are wild and kinetic. But it is Banderas’s star power that saves the day.",
    "What really elevates this sophisticated sequel is Banderas’ rich voicework, which reveals that, under Puss’ suave bluster, there’s a moody moggie discovering fear for the first time.",
    "A cat always lands on its feet — and Puss In Boots: The Last Wish does so with considerable style, rapier wit, and surprising substance. The sequel nobody saw coming just became must-see cinematic spectacle.",
    "By forcing Puss to contemplate his priorities, the sequel more than justifies its own existence, while paving the way for how his path meets the big green guy’s.",
    "Darker in tone but still extremely funny, the film, like so many of its animated brethren, falters when resorting to the frenetic action sequences seemingly designed for tykes’ short attention spans.",
    "Kids are going to love it because it’s fun and they’ll be able to spot the different nursery rhyme characters. This adult loved it because it’s funny as hell and the performances were great across the board.",
    "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline.",
    "Yes, it’s your typical Macguffin, with everybody chasing down a trinket, but a fairly creative one with a lot of good jokes. The comic-book-style action sequences also set co-directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado’s movie apart from the litter. The No. 1 reason to watch, though, is Banderas’ top-notch voice performance. If only more A-listers treated their animated film roles as more than a pet project.",
    "The script by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow is very silly, to be sure, but everything works. The animation is well done, the music has a lovely Spanish flair, and the cast does an excellent job bringing the characters to life.",
    "Directed by Joel Crawford, with Januel Mercardo as co-director, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish has enough good jokes (script by Paul Fisher and story by Tommy Swerdlow and Tom Wheeler) to keep anyone amused for an afternoon at the movies.",
    "With an excellent cast and style, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is one gorgeous and dynamic fractured fairy tale.",
    "It is Banderas who brings home the tocino and serves up the whole jamon when the situation demands it. Which in the case of the immodest, flamboyant and recklessly brave Puss-in-Boots, is pretty much every moment he opens his mouth in his delightful, and perhaps final romp as the character.",
    "Given that big-studio children’s animation so often feels like it was created by algorithm, it’s refreshing to see a kid’s cartoon like The Last Wish that’s filled with too many ideas rather than too few.",
    "It contains amusing jokes and has an old-fashioned impulse to tug at heart strings.",
    "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish brings a playful quality to the animated feline as well as a deeper message. When it comes to long-delayed sequels it’s wise to be careful what you wish for, but overall the film manages to nimbly land on its feet.",
    "The bar isn’t terribly high here, but Puss and company clear it comfortably, landing — but of course — on their feet.",
    "There’s an entire pick ’n’ mix stand of eye candy here – more than enough to satisfy younger viewers. But alas, it’s all empty calories.",
    "Puss in Boots isn’t on a rousing adventure; he’s performing the fairy-tale equivalent of grasping at miracle cures while he’s dying from a terminal illness. And although the film is funny in fits and starts, and exciting in fits and starts, the ultimate takeaway is weirdly sobering.",
    "Although this action-adventure moves briskly enough, audiences may ultimately crave a film whose storytelling is as inventive as the vibrant images that splash across the screen. But as Puss will learn, some wishes don’t come true",
    "How bland and forgettable this film is, without in the smallest way harnessing the real performing power of Banderas, Colman, Pugh, Winstone et al."

Why on earth are you giving this one a 10?!?”Because this movie…is DIFFERENT than the others. Different in that it strives to be a funnier, deeper, prettier, bolder, edgier, (surprisingly) scarier and overall more complete experience than the original Puss in Boots film over 11 years ago, and unlike that movie holds a distinct accomplishment in simply being a darn fine animated film that stands on its own, one as good as any I’ve seen in the past few years.The Shrekiverse is officially back, and judging by what DreamWorks managed to pull off here the world probably isn’t ready for whatever comes next.PS: That cricket with the spot-on Jimmy Stewart voice is one of the funniest things I’ve seen this year, whoever came up with him deserves a pay raise and a medal and free coffee and recognition from the United Nations.",

Puss in Boots: The last wish was ten times better than IIf you like movies with great animation styles, deep and interesting characters, a bit of tackling of serious themes like death, and good humour then this one is definitely for you. Puss in Boots: The last wish was ten times better than I expected. I went into the theatres expecting an alright movie perfect for an afternoon with nothing else to do, I however got out with my head and heart both in shock after the shear amount of love this film has into it.1) The animation: It definitely is inspired on the style of Into The Spiderverse, and it fits into this movie perfectly. The fight scenes look phenomenal, the colour pallette is bright and interesting to look at, and the world Dreamworks created always captivated me especially for the second half of the film.2) Characters: Puss himself is at the centre of the film, with many side characters around him also experiencing personal growth and learning important life values and lessons. The Dog character is not irritating at all, and he even helped Puss and Kitty throughout their adventure. There are no filler characters, all of them fit nicely into the narrative and into the conflict, and are relatable to the audience which is crucial in a character growth driven story. To put it shortly, all characters have believable and relatable fears, emotions and goals which help in selling the ultimate message of the film perfectly.3) The message: Despite being targeted for all ages, this movie contains many scary scenes and deals with serious themes such as anxiety, trauma and death, all of these through the character of Puss himself. Being on his last life, Puss is confronted with the reality that death is nearer than ever, which pushes him into the adventure that unfolds in the film. The ultimate message I won't spoil, but you could already figure out what it is. It's perfect, beautiful, and inspiring for anyone who watches it. 4) The humour: I wouldn't say I laughed as hard as I did with Kung Fu Panda, but thankfully the film has good jokes that land well enough and made me chuckle many times. Don't think that it has silly fart jokes or kid humour, because this film doesn't. Conclusion: Ultimately this is one of the best film I've watched this year. I will probably go many times to the cinema just to watch it, it's beautifully animated, the characters are well written and are developped flawlessly, it ends with a beautiful message and deals with severe themes which everyone can learn something from, and to top it all of arrives just in time for christmas. I'm serious, go watch this movie if you still haven't, I'm sure you'll get out just as surprised as I was. Definitely recommended.",

After a splashy opening song and a quick getaway, Puss discovers that he's blown thru 8 of his 9 lives and sets out to get the titular wish. Along the way he picks up some additional supporting characters. The visuals are vivid and colorful, but that's pretty standard for animations these days. What gives this film its oomph is the pacing, which keeps the action moving. Even though some of the new assortment of individuals has fun delivery, the biggest missing element is comedy. Ever since Trek, these films are usually crammed with clever quips and snarky references. There are some here, but it lacks punch and punchlines. Still, there's enough energy for those who want another experience with the franchise.",

When I first saw the trailer I remembered that the first movie wasn't amazing it was OK, but this film WOW it is stellar, this is the quality I expect from Dreamworks. The passion, the glory, the boots of this film truly reminded me of Shrek 2. The action is really well animated even if its chopped down a few frames, the scenes and cinematography are powerful and exiting combined with some music flares.The Visuals are really great to look at, but there are some scenes I've noticed where they looked a bit off, like it was a Pre-3D render without lighting I don't know if it Jack Horners' Face that threw me off a bit but it looked bad in some scenes.The story is generic in the last half of the film, they maybe should have stretched it out a little bit by 10 mins with some mystery, or more exploration. Other than that I like it.Lastly are the characters, these characters are excellently picked, well voice acted, and thought out. Every element of this film is linked to a scene, the directors,animators and writers really payed attention to what they can use in each scene.As for Dialogue its not bad its just lacking in something, possibly reasoning, there are one liners in here(again not bad, just missing something), especially in the last half of the film.Ratings if I dare,Visuals: 9/10Story: 8/10Characters: 9/10Plot and Pacing: 8/10Boots: 2/2Puss: 1/9Overall 7/10, wait a minute, No that's not how I feel, this is an 8/10 film it has its problems but I watched this all the way through and enjoyed it.I NEED MORE OF THIS, never knew I would say that for a Puss in Boots Film, shows you that something if done right can work. Can't wait to see the adventures in Far Far Away, hopefully we see the legend himself taking a bath or something.Great job on getting back on the Horse Dreamworks, now are we going to see some other Animations get Sequels, Personally a Megamind 2 would interest me, or maybe something brand new, pls no more Kung Fu Panda Movies unless you are going to take notes from the second film. Whatever it is go all out, and no music numbers like Disney films, something original would do well.",

The film is gorgeously animated, featuring a 2D/3D hybrid similar to the likes of Spider-Verse and Mitchells vs. the Machines, yet improved upon in some manners. The voice cast is beyond exceptional, from the returning actors in Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek, as well as newcomers in Florence Pugh and John Mulaney. Finally, and most important, the writing of this film is masterful, blending both excellent humor aimed at a more mature audience (like the Shrek movies) and deep subject matter relating to making the most of the life we do have and the people we spend it with, all of which told in a great story.

I've watched the earlier Puss in Boots movie and frankly found it to be quite dull.But this one is another matter! It's zany, witty, action-packed, sweet and a glory to behold! Sometimes swerving into old-school animation-style scenes during the action where it sort of mimics the style of \"Into the Spiderverse\" where it runs at about 15 frames per second making it look sort of like stop-motion. It's odd since they use this effect only in fast-paced action sequences and mix it with some almost 2D-centric effects. It works well, but it does take a bit getting used to. But I think I like it!The movie itself starts out a bit slow in the first 10 minutes where we sort of get the usual run-of-the-mill musical scene that always bore me to death. But I now realize that THAT scene was actually quite important for the overall plot of the movie. And the style of it as well. So now I kind of appreciate it being there. But it did make me want to turn the movie off, so I'm glad I stuck with it. I'd heard good things about it, so that made me stay.And I'm glad I did. There's some really fun and lovable characters in this one. And throughout the movie you'll realize that almost the entire movie itself becomes a character transforming and molding itself as the story unfolds. Hard to explain, just watch it!

The latter will appeal to people of all ages.   2) The film uses at least two animation styles, one of which is like that of Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse, but it is done better here. I don't think the style of the Shrek series is used here. Overall, it was refreshing to see a new style.  3) There are numerous good jokes in this film.
