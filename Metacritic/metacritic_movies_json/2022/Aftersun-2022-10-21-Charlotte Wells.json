  "summary": "Sophie reflects on the shared joy and private melancholy of a holiday she took with her father twenty years earlier. Memories real and imagined fill the gaps between miniDV footage as she tries to reconcile the father she knew with the man she didn’t.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "A brilliantly assured and stylistically adventurous work, this beautifully understated yet emotionally riveting coming-of-age drama picks apart themes of love and loss in a manner so dextrous as to seem almost accidental. Don’t be fooled; Wells knows exactly what she’s doing, and her storytelling is as precise as it is piercing.",
    "Wells has crafted a feature that gets its hooks into you before you’ve had a chance to work out what it’s doing.",
    "The mind, too often, moulds memories into prophecies. Colours get dialled up. Emotions solidify. It’s a hard thing to talk about, let alone visualise. That’s why Aftersun, the debut of Scottish filmmaker Charlotte Wells, is so astounding. She’s captured the uncapturable, finding the words and images to describe a feeling that always seems to sit just beyond our comprehension.",
    "Aftersun’s greatest achievement is to gradually reveal the imminence of a tragedy that, though never explicitly confirmed, feels inescapable by the already celebrated final shot. It is hard to think of another film that has pulled off this trick so effectively.",
    "Aftersun gives all its love to a past reimagined, as it punctures the present.",
    "Rare and special is a film capable of summoning this much poignancy: a feeling which lingers well beyond the film’s final, achingly moving moments on screen. That Aftersun is the debut from British filmmaker Charlotte Wells only adds to its accomplishment.",
    "The Scottish writer-director Charlotte Wells’ minimalist masterpiece Aftersun draws us into the lives of a father and daughter on a summer vacation in such a natural and gradual way that we feel like we truly know them as the days and nights go by, and we care deeply about them. And yet it still comes as something of a jolt when the final moments of this movie hit us SO hard, like a sledgehammer to the heart.",
    "As more of the pieces of the puzzle are revealed, the movie never exploits them. Instead, they fall into place the way memories do. Indeed, the way the best movies do: as revelations that are nevertheless mysterious.",
    "Lemmons’s film is an exercise in memory disguised as Southern gothic.",
    "Without being explicit, and by leaving the details up to us to intuit, Wells has given us a film that has a tonal delicacy yet a deep emotional core. It’s a beautiful debut film.",
    "Aftersun is a film about memory and regret, of finding small islands of warmth and happiness and holding on; a movie that beautifully struggles to say what is unsaid.",
    "What’s wonderful about Wells’ instincts, and her sense of craftsmanship, is that she never spells anything out for us. Yet we walk away feeling that we know these people, even if we aren’t clear on all the specifics of their lives.",
    "It’s a work of masterful and almost unbearable melancholy.",
    "Though any honest summation can't do it justice, Charlotte Wells's tender feature debut is the kind of revelation that movie fans dream of finding: not a wow so much as a guaranteed piece of emotional ravishment.",
    "Consciousness operates on multiple tracks and Aftersun understands this. The multi-level awareness is not in the dialogue, but it's there in the film's gentle rhythms, the editorial choices, the patience and sensitivity of Wells' approach.",
    "It’s impossible to deny the immersive, dreamlike quality of Aftersun, which hinges its success on the impressive performances from Mescal and Corio.",
    "If Wells has assembled a note-perfect evocation of a highly specific chapter — the end of a millennium and possibly something else — it’s when she deliberately breaks with realism that this gently aching movie achieves an overwhelming emotional force.",
    "The film isn’t merely some metatextual exercise, though. It’s deeply felt, a warm embodiment of a liminal time in life when our conceptions of ourselves and our loved ones come pinging into focus while also, somehow, drifting into new confusion.",
    "It’s hard to find a critical language to account for the delicacy and intimacy of this movie. This is partly because Wells, with the unaffected precision of a lyric poet, is very nearly reinventing the language of film, unlocking the medium’s often dormant potential to disclose inner worlds of consciousness and feeling.",
    "Young fathers, especially the single sort, don’t get a lot of love from the movies and “Aftersun” is partly an ode to that very specific, very sweet bond between father and pre-teen daughter that both kind of understand will change into something else soon.",
    "Somehow, Wells retains control of her unstable material, and the result, though intimate, guards its secrets well.",
    "By combining her nostalgic take on formative family holidays with an unflinching portrait of conflicting personal identity, Aftersun intentionally delivers an emotional sucker punch few will soon forget.",
    "The way the visuals all dance across the screen in flashes of brilliance that strip away the barriers between form and feeling until they become one is nothing short of spectacular.",
    "A stunning debut that develops with the gradual poignancy of a Polaroid, Charlotte Wells’ Aftersun isn’t just an honest movie about the way that we remember the people we’ve lost — fragmented, elusive, nowhere and everywhere all at once — it’s also a heart-stopping act of remembering unto itself.",
    "Wells’ debut is a frankly astonishing work which will leave a lasting impression.",
    "That a director can summon such emotional maturity paired with grand narrative originality in her first outing, particularly working from a deeply personal standpoint, astounds. Wells, a forward-thinking artist, invites into a vortex of feelings and sensations that fully exploits the language of cinema for its gorgeously humanistic pursuit.",
    "With remarkable confidence, [Wells] just lets her movie unspool naturally, like a haunting and deceptively simple short story. The details accumulate; the images reverberate; the unshowy gentleness of the central relationship inexorably deepens in importance.",
    "Aftersun flows like a fondly remembered memory that’s been replayed endlessly, as if trying to find an important detail that might explain what happened. The easy pace of Wells’s direction brings out the best in her central performers, and the chemistry between Mescal and Corio plays out effortlessly. The light moments between them are warm and the darker ones linger heavily",
    "Aftersun cuts you in two with such emotional intensity, such impressive dramatic force, that I could only sit and fight back the inevitable tears.",
    "Aftersun is a beautiful film, albeit one with too many endings, brimming with inner life and creativity, and worthy of comparison to Lynne Ramsay’s Ratcatcher and other debuts of that ilk.",
    "Cheers to  Scotland’s Charlotte Wells for making the best movie of the year by a first-time writer-director. And cheers to Paul Mescal and young  Frankie Corio for  bringing this heartfelt father-daughter story to such funny, touching and vital life.",
    "Aftersun thus works elegantly as a kind of dual coming-of-age study, perfectly served by Mescal’s signature brand of softboi gentleness — here shown maturing and creasing into more hardened, troubled masculinity — and the vitality of Corio, whose deft, lovely performance braids both authentic exuberance and a girlishness that feels more performed, as if for the benefit of her dad.",
    "Charlotte Wells’ sharp and tender Aftersun is the rare father-and-child drama that leaves you wondering who the dad will grow up to be.",
    "Most films would take pains to spell out the answers, eventually. “Aftersun” works more obliquely and poetically, leaving prosaic touches to other filmmakers.",
    "Deftly constructed and utterly heartbreaking, Aftersun announces Charlotte Wells as an eminent storyteller of prodigious powers.",
    "In its gentle, modest way, Aftersun might well break your heart.",
    "The film's introspective approach works well for developing mood, and its reliance on implied events, rather than telling or otherwise revealing the history, invites the audience to fill these gaps, thereby forcing participation in the narrative construction. It's a powerful debut for Wells, and a pleasure to watch.",
    "Aftersun may be small in scale, but it leaves a distinct and lasting impression. No question, it’s the best British movie this year.",
    "Aftersun, which Wells also wrote, is for the most part a thorough depiction of a brief period in these two peoples’ lives. But its emotional canvas is far more encompassing than this implies.",
    "While attention, fairly, will go to the work’s visual and tonal acuity, Wells’ measured but relentless probing, her careful peeling away of the layers of this intimate piece, mark her out as one of the most promising new voices in British cinema in recent years.",
    "The film has a beguiling looseness – it captures that familiar holiday feeling of good days and bad days, or moods turning for no particular reason, other than maybe spending a bit too long in each other’s company.",
    "Aftersun is lyrical without ever being obtuse, and it's a film that flourishes when attention is paid to details.",
    "It’s a series of small and seemingly meaningless incidents that, in Wells’s telling, loom large only from the vantage of hindsight.",
    "Despite Wells’ confidence as a filmmaker, Aftersun still succumbs to the predictable traps of films about childhood memories. Every small incident is presented as a big momentous event. That may be true from a child’s perspective, yet it still makes this narrative feel more formulaic than organic. Consequently, few of these beats feel revelatory to the audience, even when they are affecting.",
    "Aftersun is unnecessarily obscure and overdoes the whole “understated/unstated” thing.",
    "Bold acrobatics in editing and ambitious creative choices feel all the more superfluous next to Mescal’s effortless charisma."

There were certain sequences that made me well up even if it wasn't a big tearjerking scene. It was just because of how well the performances and the camera subtly conveyed the emotions of the characters. The strangely detached relationship of father and daughter gave the film a sense of melancholy that really effected me. The film also looked gorgeous and everything leaped off the screen.  I am so glad I got to see this in theaters. For me, it's my favorite film of 2022.",

Charlotte Wells' extremely well-crafted debut gives no clear answers about what is troubling these characters, but the way it captures the fleeting moments of joy and sorrow is rewarding enough.Paul Mescal shines as a loving yet tormented father, and Frankie Corio is a magnificent revelation; their chemistry together is off the charts.Wells' visual resources are most impressive. The way she puts together the story feels like actual memories fused together with nightmarish thoughts, where the key to what's happening lies. But the best part is that it's up to everyone to decide what to make of it.And this is what sets apart great films from common ones; they make you feel, remember and think and the same time. 'Aftersun' is a masterpiece about raw emotions and the moments we wish were never gone.",

Before even going into thisA woman reflects on a vacation she took with her father in Turkey as a child and tries to recall through faded memories and camcorder footage the man she saw as her father vs. the man she sees him as as an adult. Before even going into this gem, I had a gut feeling it was going to be special and tender in ways I couldn't quite describe or fathom. And after walking out of the theater in an almost trance-like state, I can confidently confirm that it's almost everything I imagined and expected it to be and then some. Gentle, tender, quiet, and subtly heartbreaking, it's a film that made me dig deep into several long-dormant memories and recollections of my childhood, family, divorce, relationship with my parents and especially my father during that time, etc. It's the rare film that's made me rethink and revisit so many long-buried and left behind memories that I either never had the answers to (and probably never will) and makes me see certain things in a new and different light (for better or worse.) Paul Mescal and Frankie Corio are such a loving and heart-melting pairing here as father and daughter. Although cryptic in parts, I believe it's one of those films where it's up to you to take away your own personal meaning from it, which I most certainly did. Overall, I'd say it's entirely possible that I've witnessed my new favorite film of the year so far, but it goes so much farther and deeper beyond that. It's a film I can tell that will almost certainly stay with and haunt me indefinitely (again, for better or worse.)",

ThisIt’s one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it’s something else entirely to be enigmatic and cryptic. And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist’s youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn’t feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film’s poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters’ dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What’s more, this offering’s camera work – aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story – is packed with innocuous material. Indeed, who really cares about sitting through endless footage of the characters engaging in mundane activities like playing video games, eating ice cream and attempting to sing karaoke? The “looking back in fondness” factor in these supposedly touching segments is a little too inane to engender truly heart-tugging feelings, constituting cinematic padding more than anything integral or meaningful to the overall story. Considering all of the advance glowing reactions I had read about this release, I was really looking forward to it going in. Unfortunately, though, I came away from it almost as sad and disappointed as the protagonist herself.",

How can you have a framing motif of the father dancing amid strobe lights and yet never reveal the import? How can the critics and the audience infer anything at all about the adult Sophie when nothing subsequent to the airport drop-off is shown? Are we to believe that like Morrissey signing \" I've seen this happening in other people's lives, now it's happening in mine\" that turning 30 is supposed to be a haunting spectre that will cast existential doom on every generation?

That's why I think its conclusion is the part that left the most lasting impression on a large part of the audience.A very enjoyable film, but I don't think it's worthy of the mark it's making.",

This film is in the \"hang\" category that features people hanging out without propelling a plot…only episodes where they spend fun time together and awkward times alone.

An adult Sophie, on her birthday, looks back at twenty year old film footage of the last summer holiday in Turkey when she was 11 years old spent with her estranged father, Calum, played by Paul Mescal in his recent Best Actor Oscar-nominated role. Sophie (Frankie Corio) at age 11 is on the brink of adolescence trying to understand and come to terms with a father who is clearly loving, yet seems to be struggling beneath the weight of his life. Paul Mescal gives a realistic, tender and very understated performance, and young Frankie Corio is simply endearing as Sophie. The film, co-produced by Oscar-winning Director Barry Jenkins (\"Moonlight\"), leaves it up to the audience to decide the fate of Sophie's father at the end of AFTERSUN. The sense of melancholy I felt while watching the film left me with the understanding that for Sophie, 20 years of loss seems a lifetime, while her memories feel like only yesterday.",

One of those films that improve the more you think about them.THE BAD: I had to make a great effort to go through the first hour. Its rythm and editing made it hard for me to engage with the film, at least if it is your first watch.",

It's hard to be engaged to a story that doesnt really go anywhere but implies through editing that it is building up to something. It almost feels like we as the audience are being cheated.

But apparently the critics like it? However, if you would film a boring cheap holiday in an ordinary resort, with not even an interesting excursion (endless posibilities...), only the forced animation (help), then this would be the result. Still very boring. More music could have helped, but even the karaoke is also badly sung! On purpose to pester the audience no doubt. Looking at the uncritical critics reviews its about a depression? Other than that obtained by the viewer a holiday with family is not the right time to be depressed. There are no explications for anything, only some observations of young people by the even younger? Good for a nice videoclip, or two, but hopelessly uninspired. As happens a lot these days. Read books and make   movies about them if you can't write a decent story!!!",

Well, this film certainty does. The film’s cinematography is easily the highlight and it adds the needed tension to the scenes that would be theoretically calming. Otherwise, it’s a good film that tells a chilling simple simple story. It’s certainty not a masterpiece though.+1 point for Chumbawumba (joke)",
