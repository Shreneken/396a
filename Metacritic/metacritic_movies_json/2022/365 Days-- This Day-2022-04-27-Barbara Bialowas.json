    "critic_reviews": [
        "No, most audiences who tune into 365 Days: This Day are likely not seeking out female empowerment tales or coherent plots, but the disdain with which the film treats both its viewers and its star can\u2019t help but grate.",
        "365 Days: This Day is barely a movie. It\u2019s the emotionally bankrupt id of late capitalism, a braindead miasma of choreographed sex and nonsensical fighting driven by greed and violence masquerading as passion.",
        "There are no stakes, and there\u2019s little that\u2019s offensive, except to the art and craft of cinema. It\u2019s funny. It\u2019s glossy. It\u2019s a fantasy. It\u2019s safe. It\u2019s soft.",
        "Frankly, this is the kind of soft-core smut where it\u2019s the character development and dialogue that feel gratuitous.",
        "It\u2019s piping hot trash."

Hot bods, unaffordable cars, little bit of the bump n' grind, eh gov'na? But seriously folks, new Star Wars and Avengers movies churn out every few months and they all suck because its a total recycle job. Viewers give them decent reviews because our society is devoid of ideas or too scared to take a risk on new things. 365 Days of hot sweaty garbage makes me pleased that this critic buttheads had to sit through it. I haven't seen it yet but I can GUARANTEE you it's bad enough to be funny.",

I found it a tiny bit more watchable than its predecessor.'365 Days: This Day' still has nothing that even closely resembles a plot, still has extremely limited actors and still shouldn't even exist. However, I'd be lying if I said I disliked it as much as the 2020 original. It's almost like taking out the sexual violence actually makes it more digestable, who'd a thunk it?!Unlike that other release, this falls into the more common category of just simply being rubbish. I will say, though, the music kinda slaps. The film is pretty much comprised of a series of sexual music videos placed back-to-back-to-back. Some of music used is well chosen I can't deny, I Shazam'd a couple... admittedly that probably says more about my taste in music than anything else! \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00afThere's even some minor neat cinematography, too. The positives I note are minimal, though, and don't overly help this 2022 production. I have more negatives, which also include an overlong run time and that shoddy ending. At least it marginally improves upon the film it follows, I wonder if its own sequel will do likewise? I plan to find out!",

As bad as the first one was, there was a little bit of something going on, and there's perhaps even more sex here, which may be fine with some people, but the thing is, for the first half or so of the film, there's a sex scene every now and then. You're kind of watching sex all the time until about the second half of the movie, where it slows down a little bit with those scenes and a little bit of story comes in, which I think is just as weak. So what does this film have to offer? The first half is all sex, which we can find everywhere on unnamed sites these days, and the second half has some plot, but it's not the best. This film will probably please only the biggest fans of the first part. I would advise others to avoid this one. It has nothing to offer in my opinion. Unless you want a good dose of eroticism without a deeper plot. Otherwise, I don't know. For me, a bad film that I don't recommend.",
