  "critic_reviews": [
    "The thing about Spielberg these days is he makes this stuff look easy.",
    "The Fabelmans left me with a floating feeling of happiness.",
    "While some might have preferred this story with its edges unsmoothed, The Fabelmans is better viewed as the tale of how Spielberg’s personal values inform his every artistic decision, and how he became who he is: The Greatest Showman On Earth.",
    "In two-and-a-half hours, a decade of Spielberg’s own life flies by. An autopsy of a marriage and a homage to invention, it’s a bittersweet piece of joy.",
    "You think [Spielberg's] giving you everything and that it's all right there on the surface, but the movie lingers in the mind, and the longer it stays there, and the more times you re-watch it, the more you realize it's giving you something different from, and better than, what you saw the first time.",
    "This is Spielberg’s most personal film, and it’s intriguing to watch him pay homage to the directors who made up his group of friends in the early 1970s.",
    "I hope Spielberg makes 20 more movies. But if this is the last one he ever directed, it would be the perfect career capper: An origin story, a thesis statement, a love letter, and a cautionary tale. Like life, it is hilarious at times, and pitifully sad at others. From the first scene to the last, it had me leaning forward in my seat like Sammy Fabelman at The Greatest Show on Earth.",
    "Bring out the Oscars for the year’s best movie, a personal best from Steven Spielberg about his own coming of age as a teen torn between his love for movies and family (Michelle Williams is incandescent as his troubled mom).  You won’t forget this hilarious and heartfelt classic in the making.",
    "The Fabelmans is a measured and incredibly intimate look at Spielberg’s upbringing as he developed his aptitude for storytelling through a medium that mesmerized him since the night he went to see The Greatest Show On Earth as a child. It also spotlights cinema as an extraordinary device that not only unveils powerful truths, but often shapes them as well.",
    "Immediately joining the first ranks of artists’ memoirs, Steven Spielberg’s The Fabelmans is both a vivid capturing of the auteur’s earliest flashes of filmmaking insight and a portrait, full of love yet unclouded by nostalgia, of the family that made him.",
    "It’s gripping, visually mesmeric, boasts an exceptional, grounded script by Tony Kushner and is acted to the hilt.",
    "It’s Spielberg’s most personal film, one that gorgeously revives the memories of his childhood and youth with a lavish sense of wistfulness and an aptly Hollywood-ized, fable-like touch.",
    "Spielberg has given us all so much magic over the course of our lives, and The Fabelmans becomes yet another Spielberg masterpiece, but this time, by showing us how this magic came to be in his own life.",
    "Spielberg’s storytelling has plenty of humor and verve, but it has a devastating sense of self-awareness as well. In focusing on a boy who puts a camera between himself and the world, Spielberg essays both the power in that perspective, and the limitations.",
    "The warm, witty Fabelmans is Spielberg at his most revealing, and watching him reflect on his past is downright extraordinary.",
    "It feels a little too light and even occasionally uncertain in the early going, but picks up steam, becomes deeper and more moving and absolutely nails the ending.",
    "The Fabelmans will take your expectations of the Spielberg brand and tie them to a rocket. It is engaging and compelling. I am still pondering it days later. If you love movies, you owe it to yourself to catch this on that same big screen that Sammy loves so much.",
    "Exceptionally well made, tougher than you'd think in its depictions of a troubled marriage and full of deep performances — it's outstanding.",
    "The Fabelmans is, as the title says, somewhat of a fable and wonderful in both large and small ways, even if Spielberg can’t help but soften the rougher, potentially lacerating edges. It’s what he does; it’s also what the audience expects of him, and he’s nothing if not obliging.",
    "With a coming-of-age story that is universal in its portrayal of misunderstood artists and broken homes, but hyper-specific in its portrayal of the childhood that formed a legendary filmmaker, this is a therapy session turned into a hugely entertaining movie, aided by a fantastic cast, and one of John Williams' best scores in years.",
    "The Fabelmans is Spielberg exercising his vast filmmaking knowledge to compose a story where his entire heart is stapled across the screen. It’s beautiful, evocative, enthralling blockbuster filmmaking, perfectly tuned to remind viewers of the power that can reside within a movie.",
    "Like all great storytellers, Spielberg knows the value — the beauty — of artifice and embellishment, as well as the permeability of truth and fiction. The Fabelmans is as slick, transporting and painstakingly orchestrated as anything in his filmography, and also as funny, stirring and implacably sad.",
    "Semi-autobiographical and dedicated to his late mom and dad, the film is a potent memory piece guided by remarkable performances from Michelle Williams and Paul Dano, who are asked to walk a delicate tonal tightrope, delivering a portrait of an imperfect marriage that’s heartbreaking in its tenderness.",
    "With The Fabelmans, Spielberg is grappling with his own mythology, and re-examining it, too. This isn't exactly how Spielberg's life unfolded; it's the Hollywood version, and that's fitting.",
    "Steven Spielberg’s The Fabelmans is not a love letter to the magic of the movies. It’s a nice note to more tactile matters of craft—how to thread a reel of film into a projector, for instance. And yet, in the process of paying attention to such details, The Fabelmans manages something even more specific than love: a deeply personal ardency for both how and why movies are made.",
    "The Fabelmans is a movie about being seen — and about learning to see.",
    "This filmmaker has earned the right to make a movie about why he makes movies the way he does. And with Williams and Dano, especially, he gets performances that can match the technique.",
    "Typical Spielberg. Pulling on multiple heartstrings at the same time, to great effect.",
    "The Fabelmans does it all, with an expansive spirit and that quintessential Spielbergian combination of honesty and sentiment. It tells the truth, at a honeyed, ameliorating slant.",
    "It’d be disrespectful to those left behind if you gave your art anything but your best shot. The Fabelmans makes the bargain look painful, self-centered and utterly joyful—a genius embracing his regrets and in so doing, reminding us of how lucky we are that we all pay some version of this price, for ourselves and for one another.",
    "Steven Spielberg’s The Fabelmans, which won the coveted People’s Choice award at the most recent Toronto International Film Festival, is a warm and easygoing family drama and coming-of-age story based on the director’s life. But you’re out of luck if you’re looking for deep insights into how a boy seized by movies, grew up to be one of the most successful directors in Hollywood.",
    "Because it's Spielberg, it's all beautifully, meticulously rendered, and not a little glazed in wistful sentiment: an infinitely tender, sometimes misty ode to the people who raised him and the singular passion for cinema that shaped him.",
    "I’d say this playful yet nakedly personal coming-of-auteur epic was trying to split the difference between memoir and crowdpleaser, but it seems even more determined to reconcile the two: What else would Steven Spielberg’s ultimate divorce movie be about if not the hope for some kind of reconciliation?",
    "The great storyteller has been careful in interviews to remind us The Fabelmans is only semi-autobiographical, but everything cuts so deep that you’re left wondering if Spielberg left any of the truth out at all.",
    "The result is neither as sentimental nor as moving – if those adjectives can be separated – as the director’s more personal 20th century films. It does, however, feel complete in itself. Cleanly shot. Immaculately performed. And, no, you probably don’t need to know Spielberg from Carlsberg to have a good time.",
    "The Fabelmans clearly comes from a place of deep sincerity – while it might not be a particularly “deep” film, it is absolutely the Spielberg film about Becoming Spielberg that we’ve been waiting for, echoing the world of child-like wonder and the tenacity to manifest dreams that his whole career has centred around.",
    "Spielberg’s motivation for The Fabelmans has little to do with cementing his own myth – it’s a more tender, more bittersweet journey towards the realisation that, though the camera never lies, what it shows us can be hard to swallow.",
    "Spielberg gets the chance to do something he’s never done before and make a miniature high-school film full of giddy subversions and emotional truths.",
    "The Fabelmans is a compelling family portrait, a love letter to filmmaking, and a revealing look inside the heart of one of America’s great directors. It’s well worth watching, just to see Spielberg at his most tender and personal.",
    "Embedded in this seeming valentine to the movies is something pricklier, sadder, and smarter.",
    "The Fabelmans may look nice ’n’ easy as it swings along, with a pile of laughs to cushion the ride, and a nifty visual gag in the closing seconds, but take care. Here is a film that is touched with the madness of love.",
    "Understanding that a knockout finish is the most important element, Mr. Spielberg delivers spectacularly in a scene drawn from a real-life meeting. He puts a mischievous twist on his well-earned reputation for sentimental endings by dramatizing an encounter with one of the gods of celluloid.",
    "After you see The Fabelmans you realize this man will never stop making movies. It truly is his life. And, here, he is inviting us in to see how and why that all happened.",
    "If the movie does adhere to his signature beats, and feature so many recognizable Spielbergisms, occasionally to its detriment, it’s still one of the most impressive, enlightening, vital things he’s ever done.",
    "Not all memoir is generous. It can be intriguingly solipsistic, or maddeningly vain. But because there’s always been a curious blankness to Spielberg’s public persona—cheerful and engaged but never quite known—The Fabelmans does feel like something of a gift.",
    "Spielberg’s a born storyteller, and these are arguably his most precious stories.",
    "While the film provides many invaluable insights into Spielberg’s technical and thematic tropes that can be seen repeated throughout his career, the filmmaker also burnishes aspects of his life story and leaves out chunks of years to create what is inevitably a self-indulgent yet delightful origin story, appropriately called The Fabelmans.",
    "It’s a magical movie memoir of the making of a movie-maker, with Spielbergian sparks of delight and inspiration, and heaping helpings of Spielberg sentiment.",
    "Unsurprisingly, Spielbergian wonder is sprinkled throughout the episodic Fabelmans. The movie starts out slow, though when the filmmaker gets to Sammy’s high school days, he finds that signature electricity so apparent in his blockbuster career.",
    "So The Fabelmans is entertaining enough, but perhaps what’s best about it is that Spielberg got it out of his system. After this, he won’t ever need to make a film about himself or his parents again.",
    "The Fabelmans isn’t likely to go down as “Great Spielberg” or even “Very Good Spielberg” but it’s a warm, enjoyable plunge into the 1950s and 1960s.",
    "It’s a deeply personal chronicle from one of cinema’s greatest talents, yielding a movie that features wonderful moments within a somewhat scattered narrative.",
    "In my opinion, Mr. Spielberg’s life story is always slickly directed, professionally written (a collaborative effort by the director and prize-winning playwright Tony Kushner) and admirably acted by an appealing cast, but only intermittently interesting and less than what I’d call mesmerizing.",
    "It might not become anyone’s favorite Spielberg flick, but it will certainly stick with you long after you watch it.",
    "The Fabelmans is a provocative investigation of the cinematic medium from one of its great masters.",
    "For all its tenderness, empathy, warmth, and verve, The Fabelmans has the feel of mythmaking—a feature-length promotional video for an authorized biography of a filmmaker who, if far from self-made, is in any case self-propelled. What’s missing is a sense of history.",
    "Spielberg is such a supersleek craftsman that what might have been intended as a deep dive instead comes across for the most part as a sprightly gloss.",
    "There's an air of tranquility about it and Spielberg does well to balance a few comedic moments with a whole lot of heart. Even the more dramatic moments are depicted with patience and warmth. It's as if Spielberg is softly wading through his own memories, pulling open the doors to see each one with a lot of light and love in tow.",
    "The most interesting parts of this baggy, inevitably indulgent, and often spectacular work find him grappling with the idea of putting himself onscreen versus adapting part of his life into the stuff of a movie.",
    "Ever the canny salesman, The Fabelmans is mostly a clever mix of things the audience has seen and expects, with enough new to tantalize without scaring anyone off. It’s nice to see Spielberg finally giving us a bit of himself, even if it could be more.",
    "If you’re looking for a film that explains where the Spielbergian tropes you know and love came from, then The Fabelmans is for you.",
    "The Fabelmans contains reels’ worth of beauty and wit, all delivered with the honest and enthusiastic drive to entertain that has become Spielberg’s signature. But you will learn more about Steven Spielberg by watching almost any other Steven Spielberg film.",
    "There remains a remove though still, Spielberg giving us a slightly too stage-managed version of himself and his family, some gristle missing from the darkest moments.",
    "The focus sometimes gets a bit blurry, to be honest and the whole thing often doesn’t add up to much.",
    "As this semi-autobiographical film plods on, there is an unshakeable sense that in reaching for the stars, The Fabelmans instead lands somewhere more mediocre and disappointing."

The way young Andrei's mom is included in the film is also simply beautiful. Unline Spielberg, he  is not pretentious in reducing his mom to the clichéd persona of the neurotic failed artist, he transmits his love in a far more inquisitive way.   On the other hand, what to expect of someone who turned the horror of the Holocaust into a dumb and simplistic spectacle in Schindler's list to sell to an uncultivated audience?In a hundred years, dumb 'Meuricans will have forgotten Spielberg like those 1930 and 1950 makers of escapist movies, for but one film, Jaws.

So we owe him this self-indulgence.What Spielberg andLet’s be fair:  If any filmmaker has earned the right to make an autobiography, it’s Steven Spielberg.  Over the years, he’s given us films that were touchstones for two generations.  So we owe him this self-indulgence.What Spielberg and Co-Writer Tony Kushner (“Angels in America”) have created is puzzling.  From my perspective, the film is in three acts of widely varying lengths and equally diverse intentions.  The first 75% of this film traces Spielberg’s development from his first movie experience, seeing DeMille’s “The Greatest Show on Earth,” through his adolescent movie-making.  It’s ironic that the re-creation of Spielberg’s early movie-making is actually pretty dull, offering little insight into his cinematic sensibilities.  During this time, the fissures in his parents’ relationship - and the ripple effects throughout the family – become apparent.  When it’s not being depressing or sad, this section of the film is remote and emotionally distant, apparently because of Spielberg’s tortured attempt not to take one parent’s side in the conflict.Act Two explores Spielberg’s move to Northern California and his experiences in a high school which was apparently heavily populated by very tall Aryan males.  We discover that his first girlfriend is a devout Christian (her wall is a shrine dedicated equally to Jesus, Fabian and Bobby Rydell) who hopes to save his soul.  She also has apparent difficulty conflating religious fervor and sexual arousal.  This section of the film is just as impressionistic as Act One, but the colors are brighter and the tone is light, if not frivolous.Act Three lasts only a few minutes. In torment, Spielberg’s character has decided to drop out of college to pursue his dream.  Along the way, he’s given a five-minute audience with Director John Ford, who offers weighty utterances about cinematic technique through vast clouds of cigar smoke.  This causes our protagonist to stride happily, optimistically into the sunset for no apparent reason.Along the way, Spielberg and Kushner offer some alternative theories about Spielberg’s passion for filmmaking.  For Spielberg, is filmmaking a way to control and make meaning of the chaos around him?  Possibly.  Could making movies be a buffer and an escape from family tension as his parents’ marriage disintegrates?  Maybe.  Could making films offer an antidote for personal loneliness?  Could be.  Was moviemaking simply a way for Spielberg to find his place in the confusing social landscape of childhood and adolescence?  Kinda.  Does he enjoy playing God, deciding the winners and losers in his narratives? Perhaps.  The most frustrating element of this film is that Spielberg seems more perplexed about the events around him and his own motivations than he has ever been when filming his iconic characters.  But then, maybe that’s the way it is with humans.  When we’re the subject of the conversation, it always messier.  At the end of the day, life is apparently just as confusing for Spielberg as it is for the rest of us.",

Spielberg obviously made this movie with care since it is about his childhood and that care I think really shows in the final product. The performances are really strong especially Gabriel LaBelle and Paul Dano. The Mitzi dance scene is one of my favorite scenes this year. I think the coming age of story is pretty standard but I think there is always interesting going on with the characters so I didn't mind. I just wish it dove a little deeper to the darker side of his complex relationships with his parents since it gets kind of abandoned in the latter half of the movie. John William's final score for Spielberg is emotional and really wonderful. Overall, I really like the movie but I wish I could have seen the more darker sides to the certain events that happen in the film since almost everything is conveyed so optimistically.",

Here, it's Steven Spielberg in the director's chair and the director's whole soul is on display for the world to see. Reverent, earnest and cheeky, this film leans further away from the usual trappings of the Hollywood biopic, opting instead to tell a coming-of-age tale that's freer in form than expected. In any event, it's undeniably fascinating to see any filmmaker mulling over the elements of their own life and then applying artistic flair in turn. There's something even more surreal about that filmmaker being the literal person whose last name is most closely associated with the profession of filmmaking itself. Definitely a solid watch.",

Coincidentally filming of that movie took place at Roy Thompson Hall where the screening of this movie was. In the film Sammy Fabelman, as Spielberg’sI remember my first childhood experience in the cinema with my brother going to see X-MEN. Coincidentally filming of that movie took place at Roy Thompson Hall where the screening of this movie was. In the film Sammy Fabelman, as Spielberg’s onscreen proxy, witnesses The Greatest Show on Earth. His first childhood cinematic experience. The Fablemans does not match the experience of seeing X-MEN or The Greatest Show on Earth for the first time, but its recreation of childhood may be enough to inspire others to go out and do the same. If you ever wish you could go back to when you were younger with all the knowledge you know now, Spielberg has the solution: make a movie.It was my favourite film of 2022. This is a director who has made 33 films over 4 decades and his talent and experience show. It’s fun to spot the references to Spielberg’s other work during the film.What I was most worried about going into the film was Spielberg’s writing. He’s not known for being a writer. His dialogue is plainspoken, tin-eared, and a little corny. Yet he’s smart enough not to try and make poetry. The dialogue is simple enough for an 8-year-old to understand. Even though Dad (Paul Dano, low key) explains in groan-inducing technical terms how movies work, reciting what sounds like the first page out of a film studies book. It still is earnest.The script for the movie started with his sister Anne in the 90s. She is known for writing the Academy Award-nominated script for the Tom Hanks movie Big. Funny enough, in the movie she is portrayed onscreen in by Julia Butters. When she tells young Sammy he should make more movies starring girls. It’s definitely an acknowledgment of his limitations.The female lead characters in Ready Player One (Art3mis) and West Side Story (Maria) demonstrate his growth in directing female characters. But his female lead here Mitzi is a step back.Michelle Williams plays the mother Mitzi. Reaching for the emotional highs of her previous character in Blue Valentine, Williams dials it up. However, the screenplay doesn’t lend the necessary depth to support her character. So in her overacting, it feels closer to Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Her best moment comes when she brings her children out of the house towards a literal tornado. “Is it safe?” One of the daughters asks. “Of course it’s safe, I’m your mother!” A resonant moment that succeeds at making Mitzi interesting. But the film doesn’t counterbalance her zaniness, rendering her cartoonish.A Best Actress Oscar campaign is underway to promote Williams. She isn’t a Lead, but it looks like Spielberg is trying to perfect his record. In the last decade, his films have collected Oscars in all other acting categories.I wanted more of Sammy’s complicated relationship with his father Burt. The father-son dynamics of Spielberg’s films are often a highlight. It’s clear the director wanted to focus on the nourishing creativity Mitzi provided, but greater closure for the father character was needed. The rest of the family is supportive, so the father is the main opponent. However, thanks to the film’s focus on Sammy’s internal journey, the external relationships matter less.The Fabelmans is able to make up for its shallowness in two ways; direction and acting. Because his parents are so distinct, Sammy’s conflicts remain clear. Gabriel LaBelle is perfect as Sammy. He’s given heavy material but doesn’t overdo it, landing several emotional beats with the right touch. A showdown with a high school bully nails Spielberg’s quiet and not-so-quiet confidence. The family ensemble gives the movie its heart. Particularly Seth Rogen in his final scene. It’s far from Rogen’s best work, but the audience did get a kick out of hearing his iconic laugh. Such touches remind you there’s real life put into these roles. It all adds up to Spielberg’s biggest emotional punch in decades.Despite the heavy subject matter, there is a lightness to it, it is literally Spielberg. The brilliance is knowing he’ll land on his feet. Perfect for a coming-of-age film. Whenever Sammy contemplates quitting there’s fun in waiting to see what inspiration strikes for him to pick up the camera again. The movie doesn’t kid itself. The setbacks Sammy faces are temporary. As bad as things get, and they can get pretty bad during high school, there is still light at the end of the tunnel.",

These 4 performances deserve tons of award nominations. The cinematography is beautiful, as we can all expect from the great Janusz Kaminski. John Williams' score, while a bit more subdued and minimalist this time due to it being mostly driven by piano, suits the film's uplifting tone, no matter what people think of it.

Our director, of course, shows no regrets; the tale articulates the painful experience of letting your relatives know that you don't want to follow their path in some way or another, just as little Paul in James Gray's 'Armageddon Time.''The Fabelmans' is a simple coming-of-age story, but what elevates it is the honesty of the screenplay, the acting, and the way it focuses on the mother — played brilliantly by Michelle Williams. As an artist herself, her struggle shows the consequences of not finding yourself and being held down by your own family — in her case, her mother.This is Steven Spielbergs most intimate movie in maybe decades, but it's not short of spectacle; the amateur filming sequences are outstanding. 'American Graffiti' and 'E.T.' come to mind when you're watching this; memories of a great time mixed with the urgency of the present. Oh, and the last scene is just memorable.

Written, produced, and directed by Steven Spielberg, this is by far his most personal and autobiographical film to date, as he essentially showcases his own personal upbringing and everything that led up to his success and inception of his now legendary Hollywood career. Sharing with us all of the most tender and personal moments of his life such as, going to see 'The Greatest Show on Earth' as his first film in the theater, his parents' divorce, his struggles with growing up Jewish and suffering bullying and anti-Semitism, splitting his time between Phoenix and Hollywood, etc., Spielberg tells all here in his typical grandiose, nostalgic, and endearing fashion. Young actor Gabriel LaBelle as the high school-aged Sammy Fabelman (who is essentially Spielberg) captures the spirit and determination of the filmmaker wonderfully. Williams and Dano as his mother Mitzi and his father Burt respectively also deliver some of their best and most tender work here. Judd Hirsch even briefly appears in one memorable scene as his uncle, and Seth Rogen also plays his own goofy self here as the uncle-like figure to Sammy. Production-wise, we are graced with beautiful cinematography that really manages to capture the look and feel of the era quite nicely, and Spielberg's go-to composer John Williams also delivers a beautiful and uplifting score as he always does. There are times where it feels a little overly sentimental and sappy, but I for one have come to expect this for most Spielberg films at this point anyway, and it almost certainly didn't hinder my enjoyment. Overall, it's an absolute love letter to film fans all over, and a beautiful and true testament to the power of film and its ability to move, inspire, and simply make us feel something. It's films like this that reaffirm just why I love films so much and am the huge film buff that I am and always have been for as long as I can remember. They truly shape who I am, and this film is a beautiful, touching, and tender reminder of that. Hats off to you Mr. Spielberg!",

Sammy's hesitant, yet supportive parents, Mitzi and Burt Fabelman are played by the luminous Michelle Williams and the convincing Paul Dano. Also in the film, Judd Hirsch making a short but memorable appearance in his recent Best Supporting Actor Oscar-nominated performance as Sammy's cantankerous Uncle Boris. Spielberg pays homage to the wonders and realities of youth, dreams and love of cinema seen through the eyes of Sammy whose early life witnesses his mother's unrealized musical aspirations, his father's multiple job changes resulting in the Fabelmans various moves from state-to-state, and the ultimate breakup of his family following his parents divorce. All this going on while Sammy realizes and begins to nurture his own artistic talents for filmmaking. A highlight of the movie is an almost unrecognizable David Lynch who appears at the climax of the film as Iconic director John Ford who talks to Sammy about the importance of horizon in good filmmaking. Steven Spielberg is one of the great directors who is blessed with a true gift for storytelling and he accomplishes this, again with THE FABELMANS. You may recognize his abiding love for Indiana Jones in this film through the character of a handsome, tough on the outside, flawed on the inside high school track star, caught on camera on Ditch Day by 18 year old Sammy Fabelman.

Funny enough it is also directed by Steven Spielberg. I haven't ever seen a biopic story that is also directed by the person the story is about. That interested me a lot but knowing it was about the legendary director Steven Spielberg is what made me want to watch it. Is the movie an overly self-indulgent semi-biopic, or does Steven continue to show why he is such a great director?The film is such an interesting piece as the characters themselves are fictional but based on real people. For example, the character that is meant to represent Spielberg is named Samuel \"Sammy\" Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle). What I appreciate is that Steven doesn't shy away from the flaws of the character representing him. Sammy is very passionate about filmmaking but he loves it so much that he puts it above his own family. His conflict is trying to pursue his passion while his family is tearing apart. On that note, there is a complex family dynamic with the clash of the logical but stern yet loving Dad (Paul Dano) and the artistic but selfish yet encouraging Mother (Michelle Williams). Sammy inherits both qualities from his parents but also some of their worse. Seeing the struggle of chasing a dream and their isolation is such an engaging theme. None of the characters is terrible people. They do wrong things but there is a lot more nuance to them. The story is incredibly warm, funny, gut-wrenching and powerful.The performance here is terrific and worthy of an Oscar. Michelle Williams gives an unforgettable performance as the mother, Mitzi. She shows how caring yet weird of a mother she is but shows how she is gradually getting more and more broken as the movie progresses. She could have easily made her character incredibly hatable but her performance succeeds in making the audience sympathize with her despite her being the main cause of the rift in the family. Paul Dano is also terrific as the dad, Burt. His performance is less eccentric and more subtle but he perfectly conveys the internal struggle of the character. Gabriel LaBelle plays Sammy and he is great. His character is sort of arrogant and Gabriel manages to convey that without being overly pompous and annoying.  LaBelle is terrific at communicating a young kid whose emotions are on the verge of exploding. He is a very promising young actor. In terms of supporting actors, Judd Hirsch appears for only two scenes yet he gives such a strong performance that takes over the scene. David Lynch also appears in just one scene but his scene might be the most memorable moment in the film.The music is composed by legendary composer John Williams and he continues to do a great job. Although, the score here isn't his most memorable. The cinematography is done by Janusz Kaminski of Schindler's List fame and he continues to be great here. There are tons of great and memorable shots that capture the essence of filmmaking in The Fabelmans. There is an amazing shot that has Sammy using his hands as a screen with a projector aimed at his palm which is stunning. If I had any issue with the film then it has to be the 2nd act with Sammy in high school. Scenes concerning Sammy's romance and his bullying are a little uninteresting compared to everything else. It doesn't help that his girlfriend feels very over the top and the bullies act like all the generic jocks you have seen over a dozen times. Fortunately, the high school stuff have a strong landing.Steven continues to show that he is still one of the best directors out there. Despite the film being a semi-biographic on him, he doesn't shy away from the flaws of him and his parents. He shows the struggle of chasing your passion which might resonate with a lot of people. If Spielberg decided this was his last film then this would've been a great final outing. However, from this film alone, I know he loves making films and he won't stop here. I can't wait to see his next work.",

It's that time of year when the movie landscape is crowded with holiday family movies and \"prestige\" pics. Those \"prestige\" pics are the ones attempting to garner enough attention to be considered for the Academy Awards. While The Fabelmans is a family drama, it definitely falls more into the \"prestige\" pic category. It's got everything: Michelle Williams actress-ing; Spielberg Spielberg-ing; coming-of-age tropes including a kid fascinated with a life making art. Oh! And a monkey, I can't forget the monkey. Here's how it went for me.The Fabelmans was directed by Steven Spielberg and co-written by Spielberg and Tony Kushner. There's a lot of prestigious people in mentioned in that sentence. Anyway, that talent sets the bar pretty high for this movie. The Fabelmans tells a semi-autobiographical story of Sammy Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle), a young, Jewish burgeoning film director and his family that happens to be coming apart at the seams. Sammy is introduced to the wonder of movies early and his parents unwittingly cultivate his obsession with motion pictures. Sammy's mother, Mitzi Fabelman (Michelle Williams), is a flighty, loving and passionate mother who sees herself as an artist and encourages Sammy's filmmaking efforts. Burt Fabelman (Paul Dano) is methodical and reasonable and sees Sammy's filmmaking as just a silly hobby. Sammy and his movies capture the highs and lows of his family through the 1950s and 1960s and give the audience insight into the foundation behind the film's director. Spielbergian hijinks ensue.That wasn't a great synopsis, but you get it. It's a coming-of-age story about a boy who wants to become a movie director and how that affects his family. It takes 2 and a half hours to tell this story? These coming-of-age stories can be a dime a dozen, but this one has the added layer of being told by and about the fictionalized family of one of the greatest living American directors. If you are into the Spielberg thing, then The Fabelmans should be catnip for you. If you don't really care about Steven Spielberg, then it may not be that interesting without that hook.Nevertheless, there are great moments throughout The Fabelmans. There are really interesting scenes of teenage Sammy filming and editing his low budget movies. He has some striking ingenuity in directing and adding effects to the early films. The movie tells a compelling story about the difference between capturing truth on film versus living it. There's a strong moral lesson to be learned from Sammy's singlemindedness in pursuing his art at all costs. Gabriel LaBelle does an excellent job of anchoring this movie as the main character. As for the parents, Paul Dano is very good as the mild-tempered and evenhanded Burt. Everything he does makes sense even when his family may be falling apart around him. On the other hand, Michelle Williams is all over the place, manic and grating. That may be the character that Spielberg has created, but it's also the over-the-top, scenery-chewing performance that Michelle Williams is giving.Ultimately, The Fabelmans is a good coming-of-age movie that hits some basic beats. It is elevated for those who are interested in the Steven Spielberg origin story. There are interesting parts about how the young man becomes a filmmaker, but if you don't care about that, then it's just another coming-of-age story to throw on the overflowing pile of them. For Spielberg fans, I say you'll be happy with a big box of popcorn if you venture to the theater. For everyone else, grab a bowl of popcorn for a matinee if you can't wait for it to show up on VOD or your favorite streaming channel.",

Ver o processo de criação do garoto desde quando ele se encantou com o cinema (a cena de um trem se chocando com um carro estacionado numa trilha) é de uma beleza ímpar, rende momentos de pura contemplação e fascínio.Aos poucos o garoto cresce, torna-se um rapaz, e o cotidiano   da família vai se revelando em pequenas camadas, das mais felizes às mais sombrias. Ele não deixa de relatar o bullying sofrido na escola por ser judeu, seu primeiro relacionamento, suas emoções. O garoto até tenta, por alguns minutos do filme, livrar-se do seu \"hobby\" de filmar a vida, mas o talento e a paixão que o movem sempre falam mais alto.Ganhador do globo de ouro de melhor filme e direção, de fato quando a família Fabelmans se vê com segredos relacionados à adultério é que o filme engrandece, e tudo isso sendo registrado pela câmera amadora do rapaz.A busca pelo sonho e pelo futuro profissional não deixa de ser amarga e crua, amassada pela vida cotidiana. Ver-se na tela não é apenas uma projeção, faz-nos também refletir e nos encadeia sentimentos, é capaz de transformar vidas, ou seja, o cinema atua como via de mão dupla: é feito por pessoas, mas também transforma a vida delas.O final do filme é brilhante, falando sobre perspectivas. Afinal de contas, não deixa de ser um retrato amorfo da vida, se pararmos para pensar, o cinema é pura e simplesmente diegético. Ou não.",

It's a beautiful movie to watch as his style of filmmaking has changed very little over the last 30 years or so. Sadly there was little challenge to be found in the screenplay and many of the emotional gate points for me fell sort of flat and felt a bit forced.

A beautiful homage to his life and family. A great coming of age movie and a must see for all the Spielberg fans. Young Sammy Fabelman (Mateo Zoryan/Gabriel LaBelle) aspires to become a filmmaker, facing issues throughout his childhood and adolescence with bullying and a devastating family secret. He explores his love and talent for filmmaking and how the power of films can help him see the truth.The Fabelmans is more of a love letter to Steven Spielberg's family than a love letter to cinema. It's described as the most personal film that Spielberg has ever made, and I wouldn't doubt that for a second. It's constantly tugging at the heartstrings and the emotion and love that went into this pours out of the film.My main issue with The Fabelmans is it felt dragged out and at the same time left me wanting more. Part of me wanted more behind the scenes of film and the movie making process, whereas it's more a nice coming of age story than anything else. Beautifully shot but it's not Spielberg's best. Perhaps the hype and discussions surrounding The Fabelmans over the last few months might have skewed my expectations. Or maybe it's just that the bar for Spielberg movies is just too high now. Yes it captured the nostalgic feel to it alright but if you're expecting E.T. you may be a little disappointed.The cast are perfect and with Spielberg making this I'd expect nothing less. I'm sure he took a lot of time to carefully select the actors to play his family. Michelle Williams and Paul Dano were interesting casting choices but they work. In recent years there's been a few movies now by established directors that are personal love letters to cinema, this year alone we have The Fabelmans, Empire of Light, and Babylon. And although The Fabelmans is a very well made movie, it's still Martin Scorsese's Hugo that does the love letter to cinema to perfection.The Fabelmans is the perfect choice for all the Steven Spielberg fans and movie lovers, he really is a master storyteller. Also if you've managed to make it this far without the ending being spoiled on you, try to keep it that way before seeing The Fabelmans. A definite recommendation for all the Spielberg fans.",
