  "rating": 7.6,
  "release_date": "2022-03-25",
  "summary": "Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh), a flustered immigrant mother, is contacted from a parallel universe and told that only she can save the world. The unlikely hero must learn to channel her newfound powers and fight through the splintering timelines of the multiverse to save her home, her family, and herself.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Everything Everywhere All at Once exists in the outer wilds of the imagination, in the realm of lucid dreaming and liminal spaces. It bounces off familiar representations of altered states, whether it be The Matrix or the phantasmical films of Michel Gondry, while feeling entirely unclassifiable. It’s both proudly puerile, with a running joke about butt plugs, and breathlessly sincere about the daily toil of intergenerational trauma.",
    "The film’s advocate for kindness amidst the zeitgeist generations’ omnipresent nihilism is heartfelt and hard-earned – and not without diving deep first into the dark, sticky terrains of our morals and minds.",
    "A pure firework display of technical bravado, wild invention, emotional storytelling, comedic genius, action mastery and outstanding performances, Everything Everywhere All At Once is everything cinema was invented for.",
    "Everything Everywhere All at Once is a sci-fi/fantasy/martial arts action movie on steroids: a cuckoo-bananas story about life and love and family and humanity and a bunch of other things… all at once.",
    "Amid all the razor-thin editing, constantly shifting film stocks and styles, and purposefully opaque worldbuilding lies a curiously personal, universal story about the overwhelming noise of the world, and how impossible it is to deal with it.",
    "The movie is a metaphysical multiverse galaxy-brain head trip, but deep down — and also right on the surface — it’s a bittersweet domestic drama, a marital comedy, a story of immigrant striving and a hurt-filled ballad of mother-daughter love.",
    "Without question, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” is a remarkable piece of work, one of the most original and creative films of the past couple of years.",
    "Everything Everywhere All at Once is a complex film that encompasses a variety of subjects, but it does justice to each of them with a carefully written script, marvelous performances, and a healthy dose of bizarre humor to counter its bleak story. Michelle Yeoh in particular gives a powerhouse performance in a story that puts a fresh, welcome spin on the idea of the multiverse.",
    "It's impossible to describe. It's unlike anything you've ever seen. It's the best American movie in years, and certainly the best movie to hit theaters since the pandemic began.",
    "Here is an orgiastic work of slaphappy genius that doesn’t operate like a narrative film so much as a particle accelerator — or maybe a cosmic washing machine — that two psychotic 12-year-olds designed in the hopes of reconciling the anxiety of what our lives could be with the beauty of what they are.",
    "Everything Everywhere’s multiverse is a remarkably flexible metaphor. It’s equally suitable for expressing some common frustrations the audience may relate to, about botched choices and wasted opportunity. But it’s just as suited for setting up a series of ridiculously kickass action sequences where literally anything is possible, because the characters aren’t bound by reality or causality.",
    "It’s simply up to the viewer to relinquish control, strap into the rollercoaster seat and trust that the ride will take them somewhere transcendent. And it does.",
    "What makes Everything Everywhere work is not that it’s zany, it’s that it actually finds a purpose for its zaniness, or least tries to. The Daniels are provocateurs, brilliant technical filmmakers. More importantly, they actually strive not to be full of shit. God bless them.",
    "Daniels explores the hopelessness of depression, the little miracles that truly make life worthwhile, how acts of kindness can be an extraordinary asset, and—most fitting to this film—how it’s OK to be a mess.",
    "The film, which uses the gimmick of jumping between parallel universes to explore, essentially, how to be your best self, is awash in zany sci fi culs-du-sac, sly movie references, and a deranged high fructose attitude that scoffs at the idea of everything but the kitchen sink. The Daniels want infinite kitchen sinks.",
    "In Everything Everywhere All At Once, a dizzying and aching bit of popcorn entertainment, in fact, Yeoh has never been better.",
    "The Daniels and their wow of a star Michelle Yeoh turn this visionary absurdist comedy into a volcano of creative ideas in full eruption. It’s like nothing you’ve ever seen",
    "Everything Everywhere All At Once understands that the world is infinitely big and scary, and that we often feel like we are the worst versions of ourselves. And yet, it manages to effectively advocate for us to keep going, to seek the connections and moments that make life worth it.",
    "It is a film that asks audiences to take the plunge into chaos and confusion, so that we’re able to fully see the innate humanity of what remains when the dust of it all settles.",
    "It doesn’t always make sense. But it is fascinating — and fun — to watch.",
    "Everything Everywhere All at Once may be a kaleidoscopic fantasy battle across space, time, genres, and emotions, but it’s an incredibly moving family drama first.",
    "There is so much to love about the film. Its greatest achievement is its screenplay, which is very dense. Nothing is wasted — not a single side character, joke, gag, or plot point. Every element serves a purpose to the overall story.",
    "Despite their wundercabinet of delights, the filmmakers most want to celebrate human beings in all their contradictions. Each of us, the movie says, is capable of everything.",
    "Everything Everywhere is an action-packed club sandwich of weird, but also a splendidly human experience to cherish.",
    "This is movie as inundation. It’s daring, dashing, often delirious — except that the writer-director team of Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (the Daniels, as they like to bill themselves) keeps the delirium under just enough control.",
    "The night after I saw Everything Everywhere All At Once I had a dream, in which I took a journey that was chaotic and messy and strangely beautiful. I suspect that dream was heavily flavored by the movie I had just seen, which also fit that description. The dream quickly faded, as dreams do, but the movie is staying with me, turning over and over in my head like stones in a kaleidoscope, ever-shifting.",
    "Everything Everywhere All At Once is at once a showcase for one of the world’s greatest acting talents and a manic meditation on reality, regret, and the richness of family bonds. It’s a movie that’s difficult to describe, but easy to love.",
    "The film works magic by embracing excess, finding a kind of harmony and possibility within it, and reminding us of the beauty and lunacy of the human experience along the way.",
    "It’s a preposterous and tasteless ode to the messy, nonsensical struggle and bliss of being human.",
    "Yeoh is the anchor of the film, given a role that showcases her wide range of talents, from her fine martial art skills to her superb comic timing to her ability to excavate endless depths of rich human emotion often just from a glance or a reaction.",
    "This film is not a grandiose tale of love transcending all, but it does find all kinds of sweet, specific ways to portray a lasting partnership.",
    "It’s a film that gleefully, hilariously subverts expectations at every corner, borrowing à la music videos from pop culture, experimental film, and any corner of the universe it finds inspiration in.",
    "The Daniels are unusually present ringmasters here, eschewing the flippancy that marred their splashy quirk-quake “Swiss Army Man” for a more big-feeling anarchic escapism. In their nifty code-switching, we-all-contain-multitudes metaphor, they’ve concocted something that feels genuinely attuned to our modern anxieties, but also embracing of our coping mechanisms.",
    "The result may be a tad overlong and convolutedly overstuffed, but it made me laugh, cry and think – which is more than can be said for many a Marvel flick.",
    "Come for the wild ideas, stay for the warm wisdom in the Daniels’ heartfelt carnival of chaos. Yeoh aces every curveball.",
    "At its core, however, this is a big-hearted family drama about acceptance and a love story between an older married couple. It falls to the terrific Yeoh to hold all the subplots and occasional comic misfires together.",
    "The concept is a doozy, ripe with comedic juice and packed with visual thrills.",
    "Strange, surreal and unexpectedly sentimental, Everything Everywhere All at Once is genuinely and wildly original -- the kung fu/science fiction/metaphysical action comedy that you didn't know you needed, but just might love.",
    "Crammed with ideas, jokes, laments, non sequiturs and some terrific actors you’ve seen before (if not nearly enough), the movie comes at you like a warm hug wrapped in a kung fu chop: It’s both a sweet, sentimental story about a Chinese American family and a wild, maximalist sensory assault.",
    "Truly, Everything Everywhere All at Once does one thing: exactly what the title promises.",
    "For all its attempts at delivering a heartfelt message, the finale is more something that unravels than resolves.  But Everything Everywhere All at Once is still something to see, something that demands to be seen in a cinema, mouth agape at the wonders playing out on the huge wall — the bigger the IMAX the better — in front of you.",
    "Although it runs too long, it’s nevertheless an enjoyable and satisfying romp through the lives of one woman who makes “being the worst of her selves” an asset.",
    "Written and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, collectively known as Daniels, the movie is an explosion of creative weirdness that is equal parts exhilarating and overwhelming.",
    "Everything Everywhere is fringey and wayward, too often frenetic only for craziness’ sake. But Yeoh anchors it. When the story around her flails, she gives you plenty to hang onto.",
    "It’s comically postmodern to the point of feeling almost retro, which also describes Everything Everywhere’s sense of action, its enriched sense of comedy colliding violence, practical materials (like fanny packs) taking their ranks amid the physically superhuman feats of choreography — a mix many of us rightly associate with Jackie Chan.",
    "Ultimately, though, Everything Everywhere is best appreciated for its grandiose ambitions, bombarding the viewer with its frenetic style while telling a poignant story about an older woman trying to make peace with her not-so-wonderful life.",
    "The actors, particularly the inexhaustible Yeoh, do much of the work to ground what often feels, with its dream logic and layer-cake Inception feints, like a coded story whose secret key you haven't been invited to share.",
    "What this movie could use a little more of is the rigor and self-discipline to pull off all the imagination and originality in a way that does more than leave you gobsmacked.",
    "I’ve rarely felt more impaled on the fence by a film, because, exactly as promised, it’s everything at once – good and not good; fresh yet still a formula; cramped, strenuous, full to the brim.",
    "However dazzling the vortexes this film shoots us through at supersonic speed may be, they still deposit us somewhere we’ve been before.",
    "Nothing if not true to its title, this frenetically plotted serve of stoner heaven is insanely imaginative and often a lot of fun. But at two hours-plus, it becomes unrelenting and wearisome.",
    "Everything Everywhere is ultimately too much of a good thing, a novel idea driven to the point of exhaustion.",
    "This mad succession of consequence-free events, trains of activity which get cancelled by a switch to another parallel world, means that nothing is actually at stake, and the film becomes a formless splurge of Nothing Nowhere Over a Long Period of Time.",
    "With its bland and faux-universal life lessons that cheaply ethicalize expensive sensationalism, the film comes off as a sickly cynical feature-length directorial pitch reel for a Marvel movie."

Not really surprisingly, and it's too long, ok performances by all the cast and with all the flaws and it did might sound harsh but it wasn't truly a bad movie overall but it just not the one that at very least ok too for me so i was still pretty much disappointed, despite the cool special effects and the Multiverse thing, the real story of the film was really my major problem because it didn't fit with the other side of the story, and if you erase all the Multiverse stuff, it might be even work more, it just doesn't connect, it's a mixed bag of a feeling, it felt very forced, again i like the super weird Multiverse thing that they did, the special effects, the style, the color, the lighting, the cinematography, the score, and performance was still ok, but as a whole combined with the real story, it didn't work for me, and it's surprisingly becoming my new unpopular opinion on possibly the most talked film of 2022 and the one that got a lot of praise, not for me.",

Through out my life, I have always been a positive and loving person, but lately, due many circumstances and events, I became a much more negative and sad person. The movie, in the beginning, only reinforced this perception and message of \"nothing matters, everything is worthless\". But right after convincing me, it showed how desperately wrong I was.

But after rewatching it after some time, I am convinced that it is the best form of any storytelling I have ever come across. Granted, I haven't watched, read or played every movie/show/play, book or game ever created in the many languages that exist. But of the significant portion of my life I have spent experiencing stories and my subjective & biased parameters for what an exceptional form of storytelling should ideally be based on, I am certain that this movie is the best I've come across yet.Why do I think that?Because it combines the most investigated philosophical question of the purpose of life, the most complex metaphysical theory of multiverses and the most consistently prevalent emotions of hope & despair, all together, in 150 minutes that span almost every storytelling genre there is.And it does this with a series of truly extraordinary & powerful acting performances, elegantly simple yet extremely compelling dialogues, absurdist yet coherent editing & transitions and one of the most narratively complementary cinematography ever.Furthermore, the exceptionally intelligent use of various styles of humour, balanced with a metaphorical yet deeply compassionate use of relationships, to construct a narrative that - though may appear comically-absurd & entertaining on a casual first-watch - is actually so much more; being consistently deliberate, methodical & profound on a second viewing.All this coalesces into a unique emotional journey - with an abundance of excellent humour - that inevitably transitions to a rollercoaster ride of hope crescendos & despair diminuendos, while offering convincing justifications for these ebbs and flows, concluding in an extremely cathartic & appropriate ending.Everything Everywhere All at Once - as the title suggests - is truly a story about everything, everywhere, told all at once. It's the most conclusive story of existence. And as cliched and inaccurate its ultimate moral may seem, it ingeniously conveys it in the single most hopeful & captivating manner possible.And that's why it is the best form of any storytelling I have ever come across.",

As a comedy it fails, its humor is very childish and ridiculous, there are comedy movies from the time of our grandparents whose humor still seems funny to us today, the humor of this movie is almost purely visual by showing ridiculous fights or characters dressed in ridiculous to say an example. As a science fiction genre, it also fails, despite the fact that the genre is fantasy, in general, the universe that we are presented with has consistency, it is credible, it has logic and if there are elements that are not very credible, they end up being few or scarce. The science fiction of this movie is so silly, so unbelievable that I can't really immerse myself in it. The story and relationship between the mother and her daughter, and how it develops, doesn't seem bad to me, but the other elements that I mentioned before are like ruining the experience of the movie itself. The film is new, I don't know if you could even talk about a new genre because of how incredibly chaotic it is, but even so, the stupidity of the plot, the stupidity of its universe, the bad humor, the nonsense of how several of the events take place that make me unable to recommend it and rate it negatively.",

That they don't challenge them, and they're not inventive enough. But when they break out of the mould, they dismiss them as too ambitious and complicated for those same audiences.So what the hell are we doing? Or are they telling the crowd they're too dumb?And I comment on this because one of the many things I've heard about this film is that it would be too much for the average audience, but that's not the case at all.Everything Everywhere All at Once is perhaps a film that pushes its concept a bit too far, but that doesn't make it any less appealing. Because as far as I could tell, once its plot explodes, the chaos of everything it presents is the cornerstone of the story, and therefore you must embrace that chaos.The irony of it all is that in the end it's actually a pretty ordinary story.Yes, of course, it is still an emotional, philosophical and profound journey through a complex narrative device such as the multiverse, but the underlying idea is still a story in which its protagonist must confront and question everything about her life. From her family to the decisions and failures that have brought her to the point where she finds herself when it all begins.Perhaps the teaching addressed in its conclusion is nothing earth-shattering, but the journey to reach it was thoroughly entertaining, chaotic and exhilarating, and that was something really, really good.And above all, what a great performance by Michelle Yeoh. She is the absolute captain of this film. Her co-stars do a great job too, but this is her show.",

The acting and cinematography are top notch, the multiverse story is insanely innovative and wacky, and the writing is so perfectly done and impactful. Furthermore, while the comedy comes rapid-fire at points and lands almost every time, the film takes its time for slower, more introspective scenes that leave one wondering about how their multiversal selves are and how we can make the most of this life we have here, even if it may not be as impressive as we hoped.

A wild and crazy ride thatI have never seen a movie like this. It is filled to the brim with ideas some being absolute crazy in the positive way, has great humor, a near perfect cast and fights that made the older Jackie Chan movies jealous. A wild and crazy ride that was more enjoyable than almost any other movie I have seen in years. The story starts with the worst day Chinese immigrant Evelyn Wang could imagine. Her laundromat business she had with her husband is investigated by the internal revenue service (IRS), her husband wants a divorce, her lesbian daughter wants her family to accept her white girlfriend while her estranged and traditional father just arrived while they prepare for the new year celebration. Things take a sudden change when in the elevator of the IRS building her husband completely changes personality. He says a multiverse exists and he is from a different universe / reality. The whole multiverse is in danger and Evelyn is their hope to stop the catastrophe. I stop here to avoid spoilers. The story is amazingly well written. It has so many ideas, craziness, humor and highlights. No movie I remember in recent years could compete. We think drugs were involved for a lot of ideas but everything works excellent which is the prove for the quality of writing. Think about it. If done poorly this would be a laughing stock of a story and movie. So I have to praise all writers, directors, producers and the whole team behind the camera. The actors were equally amazing and I think it is a close to a perfect cast as it could be. Michelle Yeoh is Oscar worthy and I am deeply impressed by her performance. Stephanie Hsu, Kee Huy Quan, Jamie Lee Curtis,  James Hong and Tallie Medel are all excellent and improve the movie. Then there is the humor. I laughed a lot and cant remember the last movie that was as great for the humor. The fight scenes are amazing and some put Jackie Chan to shame. Lastly I must praise the sets, costumes and CGI. They nailed the movies atmosphere and style with those. Overall this is a masterpieces and truly unique. It was so good that future movies will be rated against this for me.

I liked that its set in such a domestic, dare I say particularly boring setting as an IRS office. The visual effects are great - I liked the cartoon strip feel to some effects in particular (I won't elaborate so as not to provide potential spoilers). I found it difficult to follow all the plot details but I certainly wouldn't say that affected my enjoyment of the film overall. Watching the fast paced fight scenes reminded me a little of kung fu or samurai films of the 1970s. At times Chinese songs are played in the background and it was nice to see the various family members speaking in their (I assume) mother tongue. As over the top as it undoubtedly is for the most part, there is a point in which things slow down significantly - that is somewhat poignant. I should perhaps note that a fair amount of the dialogue is in either Mandarin or Cantonese, hence subtitles are often present, which may or may not put you off it. Its a very engrossing and yet also somewhat baffling film, with a quirky, arty feel to it to an extent but enough mainstream CGI to entertain the audience well, I reckon. It's definitely a film to re-watch, as I was left thinking 'what did I just see?' by the end.Needless to say, I would definitely recommend this film, yes.",

This movie skillfully utilises symbolism and humour to address themes of nihilism, sacrifice, depression and intergenerational trauma. Uniquely, this film could also be titled Truly All Genres All At Once as it incorporates comedy, drama and action into its core identify as a sci-fi film. There is bound to be many laugh out loud moment as well as many moments of introspections which makes it a cognitive experience as well. Adding to a mind blowing plot, is the artful directing, sound score and costume design which adds vibrancy to the message being conveyed. This aspect of the film truly makes it a sensory experience. Your brain will undoubtedly be stimulated. Overall verdict: a cinematic experience once must experience in the cinemas. This will undoubtedly one of the front runners for Best Picture.",

Before I went to the cinema, I knew nothing about the film, neither the genre nor the directors. When the movie ended, I still didn’t really know what it was but I was sure of one thing, it was amazing. The more I think about it, the more I realize that this film has no real flaw. The action scenes are very beautiful and we feel all the love of the directors for the films of Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. The editing is very fluid and pleasant. The film is well rhythmic, you never get bored. The writing is as touching as it is funny. This film is really impressive, it surprises us every second. You never really know what you’re watching, you alternate between sf and family drama. This film is really a new breath in the current film industry, an author’s blockbuster that never suffers from its low budget and that could become for the next generation of filmmakers a revolutionary film as was the first Matrix (whose film is inspired ) by its positivity, its universal message, and its cinematic qualities.",

I cannot understand how this was widely proclaimed one of the best movies of 2022. This movie is a pretentious mess that only professional movie critics would like. The editing can induce an epileptic fit, the story paper thin. The humor is crass and childish - there's a parallel universe where people have hot dogs for fingers. There's a scene where two men kung fu fight with butt plugs. Not hitting each other with butt plugs, no they fight with butt plugs inside them. In their butts. That is how you make the \"movie of 2022\", folks.According to the Wikipedia synopsis this movies handles themes like existentialism, generational trauma, nihilism, absurdism, and Asian-American identity, and I say with great confidence that I didn't see anything of the sort. Sure, it pretends to, with pretentious hand waving and preachy yelling, but there is nothing you can take away and apply to your own life.

I am, of course, referring to “Everything Everywhere All At Once.”Brought to us by the same creative minds as “Swiss Army Man,” “Everything Everywhere All At Once” is a purposeful and profound experience.  This film had me laughing in a way that I haven’t laughed in a movie theater in a long time, and even had me getting a bit teary eyed at certain parts.  There were even a couple of scenes that managed to crack me up and tug at my heart strings at the same time.  All of this, coupled with AMAZINGLY well choreographed fight scenes creates a brilliant movie that hits every mark.  I don’t want to get into too much detail, as everyone should experience this movie with as little information as possible just for the sheer “Rollercoaster Effect” that this movie has on it’s viewers.It's so refreshing to watch a movie that isn't a reboot, or a remake or a reimagining of something else!

It uses the facade of multiverse to discuss real family problems. Every small decision we make has huge implication in our life and other universe. The fighting scene reminds me a lot of The Matrix- uploading skill pack. The first 30 mins audience can still try to understand it. But after that, it’s just impossible to grasp. Director is great at using slow mo, cinematography, and music to manipulate audience emotions- basically an intense emotional roller coaster. The simplest way to understand this movie is that lady has a lot of stress- from IRS audit, from divorce request, from daughter being gay and abandoned family, from father’s disapproval, etc. Everything is fake and in her head and she’s trying to find resolution. She finally found peace at the end. Such a complicated but beautiful movie",

However I have to say I felt exhausted after watching this confusing, overlong, mess of a movie. The multiverse concept is already a well-worn trope, and ultimately the basic message of the film is quite simplistic. Too many effects, too much cgi and too many comedy kung-fu fights made me feel as though the director was making it up as he went along and throwing everything possible at the screen in case some of it stuck. I hear they originally wrote the main part for Jackie Chan, and it's a shame as he would have been ideal for this - though Michelle Yeoh was a good stand in.

It was hyper-dense , overly expositional and I hated the music. My biggest gripe with the film is its art direction - it has the thrown together aesthetic of a Gondry movie but without the charm - if it had a lusher more expensive look then the juxta-position of the ludicrous and the logical would have landed better for me and I would have been seduced. BUT at a certain point  the heart of the movie is  through the noise, the music actually gels and I found it quite touching.
