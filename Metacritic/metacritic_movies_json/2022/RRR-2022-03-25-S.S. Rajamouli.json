    ],
    "summary": "RRR is a fictional story about India's legendary freedom fighters, Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem who fought against the British Raj and the Nizam of Hyderabad respectively.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "People who hand-wring about movies being dead really need to check this one out. RRR proves that, yes, cinema is alive and well, but only if you\u2019re willing, every now and again, to look past your backyard.",
        "S.S. Rajamouli\u2019s RRR is a dazzling work of historical fiction \u2014 emphasis on the \u201cfiction\u201d \u2014 that makes the moving image feel intimate and enormous all at once.",
        "The thrill of RRR is not the density of its storytelling, though\u2014it\u2019s the exuberance of it.",
        "The battles are bloody and gory, and the set pieces are absolutely massive in scale.",
        "If you thought Hobbs and Shaw were a cute couple, you ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019 yet; RRR is bromantic action nirvana.",
        "RRR feels simultaneously personal and gargantuan in scope.",
        "It\u2019s about perseverance and the power of working together toward a common goal. Those themes are universally relatable \u2014 as is the giddy thrill of watching racist forces of imperial oppression get exactly what\u2019s coming to them.",
        "It may have a tenuous relationship with nuance, but RRR is a bombastic delight. Making the Fast And Furious series look restrained by comparison, it hits the parts Hollywood actioners just can\u2019t reach. Rise! Roar! Revelation!",
        "For all its political determination, RRR is also a musical, and an electrifying one.",
        "Riotous good fun from start to finish, RRR, a fictionalised account of two real-life revolutionaries fighting against the British Raj and Nizam of Hyderabad in 1920s India is being deservedly championed for reminding audiences what big screen entertainment is all about.",
        "Rajamouli shoots the film\u2019s action with hallucinogenic fervor, supercharging scenes with a shimmering brand of extended slow-motion and C.G.I. that feels less \u201cgenerated\u201d than unleashed.",
        "The movie is such an irresistible and intoxicating celebration of cinematic excess that even after 187 minutes (including intermission or, as the title card announces, \u201cInteRRRval\u201d), you are left exhilarated, not exhausted.",
        "The movie does everything LARGE, whether it\u2019s an action sequence or an emotional connection. By the time the 3-hour running time has expired, most viewers will be exhausted from the nonstop energy of the experience.",
        "I\u2019d say the movie is a lot, but you\u2019d need way more than those four letters to cover it.",
        "Visually exhilarating as it may be, it\u2019s worthwhile to remember that RRR is inspired by true events. It\u2019s a work of historical fiction that\u2019s just as inventive as its thrilling special effects.",
        "Obviously, one film cannot encompass everything, and as the filmmakers have themselves noted, RRR is sheer fantasy. I cannot fault viewers for enjoying RRR so much, whether they ironically lap up the superhuman stunts or get swept up in the thrilling anti-imperial action. I\u2019m concerned more about the timing of it all, the global presence, the recipe for viral success that other filmmakers will be eyeing. It\u2019s an ingenious form of soft-power propaganda, one that can be interpreted as positively asserting an otherwise-marginalized ideology.",
        "It\u2019s all in good, violent fun until it gets to be too much and you realize they\u2019re never going to top their big two-hour-mark throwdown."

Uncomplicated entertainment can be short-lived, but as long as it serves its purpose and of course has made its profit, the rest is irrelevant.RRR is something along those lines. It's an epic that indulges itself in all possible excesses.It's a bold extravaganza. Cheerful, colorful, musical, violent, extravagant, comical, flamboyant, dramatic and a bit hilarious. All focused on making this story a really really big show. And it works to a certain degree, after all, its shortcomings are clearly plot-related, but when you're making a 3-hour film that intersperses dance and singing sequences with such wacky fights, the least important thing is the story and both the filmmakers and the actors know it.That's why I do recommend and applaud this film for its fearless and ambitious staging. It's a lavish and impressive show there's no doubt about that, it's just that it's not a great film.",

It revolves around 2 men who become best friends. Meanwhile, they secretly work to overthrow the colonial imperialists who are still dominating India in the 1920s. What makes the story exciting is the way it's told: The action scenes easily rival any from Hollywood. There are moments of beautiful visual imagery. Enjoyable songs are peppered throughout, which includes a dizzying dance number (and stay thru the credits for one more.) The 2 leads are close to superheroes in strength, deed and determination, while the British villains are so evil they're almost twirling their metaphorical mustaches. In typical style of the genre, the emotions are overblown with acting to match, but they're still effective. Even with a completely predictable story and a 3-hour length, there's so much to enjoy that it continually entertains in a big way. (In Telugu with subtitles, although much of the film is in English)",

Each scene has magnificent visuals, and the soundtrack is a wonderful fusion of traditional and contemporary sounds. The plot is straightforward, but there is a lot of drama and outrageous action that intensifies as the movie goes on.

I have been hearing about this epic, 3-hour action flick from India for the past few months. I heard that it was a spectacle full of high octane action sequences, musical performances and more that had to be seen to be believed. While I couldn't catch this one in the theater, Netflix has added RRR to its service. Here's how it goes.Yes, RRR is an epic, action movie about two men on a collision course with the British Empire in India. There is Bheem, who sets out to rescue Malli, a young girl from his tribe who was kidnapped by the British governor and his wicked wife. Then, there is Rama, an Indian police officer working for the British army. Bheem is fierce and ruthless, cunning and singularly focused on his goal to save Malli. Rama is equally fierce and ruthless and set on protecting the British government. As Bheem and Rama meet and become unlikely friends, secrets and hidden agendas lead to more than they both bargained for in their relationship and lead to the simmering revolutions against the British Empire.Despite its 3-hour run time, RRR is relentless. There are some lulls when the movie is setting up its plot, but it doesn't dwell much in exposition. Believe me, you may need a moment to breathe in between these action sequences. The film moves from action sequence to musical number and back. There are crazy visual effects and boundless energy coming from the screen through the camera movements and the actors.Actually, words cannot explain what this movie is really like. You just have to see it to believe it.RRR is a must-see movie. Sure, it's long, but don't let the runtime deter you. There is enough energy and action to fill the screen from beginning to end. It is surprising and worth the time spent. Grab a big box of popcorn and settle in for butt kicking and dancing and action in RRR.",

I found myself absolutely enthralled for 3 hours and by the ending I was genuinely taken aback at how such an indulgent and at times ridiculous film could keep me so entertained from start to finish. Hard to please everyone and there will be those who criticise realism, tear holes in the plot or claim its cliche or predictable but honestly, I think they just need to learn to have a little fun. I felt the film did an incredible job of leaning into what might be considered shortcomings in the wrong setting, and that this helped paint it more as a caricature with many nods to its own absurdity along the way.

SS Rajamouli is successful in showing a strong bromanticism between Bheem and Ram (jr. NTR) and (Ram Charan) respectively..A lovely bgm which impressed me a lot...Ajay Devgan and Alia Bhatt played 10 mins role but they were impressive including Olivia Morris, Ray Stevenson and Alison Doody ..So go and watch on Netflix or Zee5 if anyone has not watched the film yet..Hope this movie gets many deserved awards !!",

It\u2019s definitely an acquired taste and eminently commercial, but it\u2019s not exactly something one could characterize as epic, groundbreaking cinema. Which is why I\u2019m stunned by all of the attention and awards season buzz that\u2019s being showered on this over-the-top offering, one that\u2019s fairly typical of releases in this genre. In this hypothetical \u201cwhat if\u201d tale about a fictitious meeting between a pair of Indian freedom fighters who struggled against brutal British colonial rule (and who never met in real life), writer-director S.S. Rajamouli takes viewers on a whirlwind action-adventure saga that\u2019s preposterous, predictable, clich\u00e9d, at times juvenile, and, above all, exhausting by the time one reaches the end of its 3+-hour runtime. The trite dialogue, corny narrative, cheesy CGI effects (particularly the film\u2019s wild animals) and monodimensional characters (most notably the big bad Brits who come across more like caricatures than villains) are all laughable, almost as much as the film\u2019s fight sequences, which play like scenes from the \u201cJohn Wick\u201d and \u201cMatrix\u201d franchises with a dash of martial arts flicks thrown in for good measure. In fact, were it not for the seemingly incessant runtime, this might qualify as one of those good \u201cbad\u201d offerings for a group movie night, though the film becomes tiresome about an hour in and can\u2019t adequately sustain that sense of high camp for more than 180 minutes. In its defense, the picture\u2019s choreography in the musical sequences is commendable (if at times it\u2019s like watching a protracted aerobics class), and the costumes, art direction and set design are all noteworthy (save, of course, for a shattered marble railing in one scene that looks like the Styrofoam from which it appears to have been made). Given all of the foregoing, however, I\u2019m truly perplexed why this release has been singled out from the other films in this genre as the beneficiary of such generous awards season recognition, perhaps other than the fact that it has been a huge box office hit worldwide, which may well have something to do with that. But is that milestone enough to drive the ample bestowing of such accolades? Remember, popcorn may qualify as a great snack, but it certainly does not a meal make.",

It\u2019s mostly nonstop energy for the entire 3 hour runtime and that\u2019s the best thing about this movie. The energy of this film is what makes this a must see from 2022 in my eyes. The performances and characters from N.T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan are great. They both have some great chemistry together and do a great job at developing their characters. S. S. Rajamouli\u2019s direction is really fun and so much better than his directing on B\u0101hubali. The action is some of the most insane I\u2019ve seen put to film ever. It\u2019s something that\u2019s hard to describe and is better being seen by your own eyes. You won\u2019t be disappointed though. It also has probably my favorite dance scene ever put to film as well. I honestly can\u2019t think of anything that tops it. When the film isn\u2019t action oriented or doing something fun then it can really drag. There\u2019s a 30-40 minute portion of the film that really drags on and on. Some of the performances here aren\u2019t exactly amazing also like from Alison Doody.
