Chronicling four years in the life of Julie, The Worst Person in the World examines one woman’s quest for love and meaning in the modern world. Fluidly told in twelve chapters, the film features a breakout performance by Cannes Best Actress winner Renate Reinsve as she explores new professional avenues and embarks on relationships with two very different men (Anders Danielsen Lie and Herbert Nordrum) in her search for happiness and identity.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "The Worst Person in the World carries a shimmery feeling of definitiveness to it. It’s the rare piece of art actually invested in why an entire generation can seem so aimless and indecisive.",
    "It’s a character study for the ages, with Reinsve, Danielsen Lie and Nordrum delivering three magnetic turns.",
    "A truthful, tender masterpiece about how coming of age has no age-limit — love, for others and for ourselves, is what makes every risk and loss worthwhile. Rarely has a story like this been told as beautifully.",
    "The Worst Person in the World swerves from bustling comedy to erotically charged romance to bittersweet drama, executing each tonal shift seamlessly even as plot twists seem to come out of nowhere.",
    "Trier and Reinsve have gifted audiences with a movie that understands the ecstasy of diving into the unknown, the flush of new love, the beauty of connecting amid unspeakable loss.",
    "On the surface, it’s a simple enough premise: a young woman transitioning into adulthood, trying to find her place in the world.  But in the hands of Norwegian director Joachim Trier, The Worst Person in the World is at one level a social satire about love, identity and relationships, and at the same time, a warm and deeply poignant look at the imperfect way life can creep up on us.",
    "The film has the measured and expansive quality of real life, which could have been dull. It’s anything but that. Instead, by making Julie so real and vivid, Reinsve and Trier accomplish something rare. They make everything that happens to her feel as interesting as if it were happening to you.",
    "Occasionally you see a movie that just satisfies on all fronts — the performances, the direction, the whole package. Even less occasionally you see one that does all that and moves you, too. “The Worst Person in the World” is one of those.",
    "Unsentimental, brutally honest, and staggeringly complex in its execution, intelligent cinema like this is a rarity.",
    "The Worst Person in the World is a poignant reminder there is beauty in that uncertainty if we can only accept it.",
    "The Worst Person in the World, Trier’s stirringly sophisticated masterpiece, unrolls in piecemeal manner, but once fully extended is a tapestry of unfeigned experiences sowed with the thread of truth, in all its painful ambivalence.",
    "Joachim Trier’s scintillating Oscar contender from Norway, led by a captivating new star in Renate Reinsve,  sets a new gold standard for romantic comedy just before it sneaks up and hits you like a shot in the heart.",
    "It's a rich story that forgoes a traditional format, challenging the conventions of the industry. It's progressive, it's unapologetically feminist, and it's unforgettable.",
    "There is a refreshing honesty in this script, penned by Trier and his longtime collaborator Eskil Vogt, that engages with nuance and the impossible complexities of life in a way that most “rom-coms” avoid like the plague.",
    "I find myself at a bit of a loss when trying to explain exactly what about it had me so engaged, probably for the same reasons Julie can’t seem to decide on a career. The Worst Person In The World feels like life. And how do you sum up a life?",
    "Worst has no shortage of gorgeous-people problems — more than enough, in fact, to fill 12 cinematic \"chapters\" — but it vibrates with real life, a film so fresh and untethered to rom-com cliché it might actually reshape the idea of what movies like this can be.",
    "Trier has an incredible ear for dialogue and can observe the pitiful drama of a millennial breakup like no other.",
    "Trier has taken on one of the most difficult genres imaginable, the romantic drama, and combined it with another very tricky style – the coming-of-ager – to craft something gloriously sweet and beguiling.",
    "The film’s focus may be tight – just a few tangled, formative years – but it encompasses so much.",
    "Trier pulls a lot of stylistic tricks in the film, but they somehow never play like gimmicks, like adornments merely there to show off the talent of their creator. The film has a lilting, lively rhythm; the glimpses we see of months and years in Julie’s life ably provide a whole picture.",
    "The film’s opening quirky comedy routines give way to something much richer––a startlingly observant, sharp, romantic, provocative, and poignant view of millennial culture and how life comes at you fast.",
    "The Worst Person in the World is a comedy, not a drama. But it’s ruthless in the way the best comedies can be.",
    "The Worst Person in the World acts as a forceful reminder that the entanglements between women and the love interests dancing in and out of their lives matter less than the lifelong relationship we must maintain with ourselves.",
    "If The Worst Person in the World is about Julie’s indecision, it’s also about Trier’s ambivalence. Some of the suspense in the film comes from wondering what he will do with her, and whether, as much as he loves her, he can figure out how to set her free.",
    "The Worst Person in the World is a concentrated emotional dose of living through the last half-decade of uncertainty.",
    "The Worst Person in the World is a wildcat in a world of domesticated dramedies and romantic comedies. Trier has made one of the best movies of this year or any year.",
    "Nobody here actually calls Julie the worst person in the world (that insult is reserved for another character entirely), but you can imagine her thinking it about herself as she considers the mistakes she’s made and the people she’s hurt. But over the course of this charming, wistful, ineffably tender movie, you also see her learn to embrace the possibility of good in herself and in every precious, unhurried moment. It’s time well spent.",
    "In essaying Julie, a character at once watery and opaque, shaped by everything around her but vocally resistant to influence, Reinsve has a tricky assignment that she nails with remarkable fluidity and grace.",
    "Julie’s restlessness is anchored by a self-confidence that Reinsve conveys guilelessly and brilliantly.",
    "Reinsve gives Julie both a hard edge and soft center, so that we root for her even when she makes decisions with which we disagree.",
    "The film may be the prime example of how to restore fun, significance, and even a little bit of sex to the well-worn terrain of the romantic comedy.",
    "For all of Trier’s stylistic flair, the best scenes in The Worst Person In The World are unadorned conversations, little pockets of chemistry or conflict. The film peaks with a self-contained romantic episode, beautifully written and performed",
    "Detailing the thrills and fears of turning 30 down to its mundane but absorbing minutiae, Norwegian filmmaker Joachim Trier’s fifth feature is a pure delight. Laugh-out-loud funny and heartbreaking in equal measure, it’s perhaps his best film since “Oslo, August 31st.”",
    "Blending melancholy wistfulness with unruly energy and piercing humour, it’s a down-to-earth tale of love and death, boosted by a brilliantly believable central performance and elevated by fantastical moments of hallucinogenic horror and ecstatic joy.",
    "Bounce along as Julie might and it’s a lively, sexy, eventful two-hour adventure.",
    "The Worst Person in the World strikes me as believable, beautiful, roving, annoying, and frequently good for a laugh. Like most of Trier’s work, it also takes you aback with its sadness, which hangs around, after the story is over, like the smoke from a snuffed candle.",
    "This vibrant, buoyant drama, intimate in scope instead of vast, takes us to Oslo—not exactly another planet, but an adventure all the same—where it builds a world of mercurial passions while its enchanting heroine, Julie ( Renate Reinsve ), belatedly and erratically comes of age over the course of several years.",
    "Joachim Trier’s The Worst Person in the World is as indecisive as its endlessly curious heroine, but it is an invigorating, exceedingly kind portrait conveying that the journey is just as—if not more—crucial as the place we end up.",
    "More than ever, Trier reveals how well he can keep shifting tones and emotional arcs without losing any narrative momentum.",
    "Any film that can combine questions of mortality with funny, fully alive scenes of sex, social awkwardness, professional screw-ups and throwaway fun is a rich one. Its brilliant, full-on performance from Reinsve deserves to be celebrated far and wide.",
    "A chaotic, unpredictable portrait of a chaotic, unpredictable individual, The Worst Person In The World is a spirited and thrillingly uninhibited piece of filmmaking from Joachim Trier.",
    "This is a film of unfolding delights, providing a terrific canvas for the actors.",
    "Though the film tries for ironic detachment – twelve chapters with a prologue and epilogue – it ultimately can’t wink away its own heartfelt compassion and sympathy, even as it refuses to provide any trite solutions.",
    "Reinsve makes a more beguiling than compelling lead, letting on Julie’s “flakey” qualities, giving us hints that she’s self-aware enough to be bothered by them.",
    "Quick, vibrant, pulsing with all sorts of crossover appeal until a slightly moribund energy takes hold toward the end, Trier’s film is never more fun than when Julie is second-guessing herself and/or trying to keep time from slipping through her fingers.",
    "Visually, it’s the experience of falling in love turned inside out. “The Worst Person in the World” is showing how it looks to feel like the only couple in the world.",
    "The movie offers no details about any conflict between domestic and artistic life—because Trier and his co-screenwriter, Eskil Vogt, display no interest in Julie’s artistic development or activity. The Worst Person in the World is driven by a relentless focus on Julie’s personal life, but it’s a focus that remains obliviously impersonal."

Split into a prologue, 12 chapters, and an epilogue, and billed as an anti romcom, this couldn't be more true, as the film surprisingly and effectively subverts the oft-seen cliches and tropes of the many that came before it in the most charming and clever of fashions. What's more, Reinsve gives an absolutely wonderful and often times relatable performance from start to finish. The film's story and writing is clever and insightful on so many things and observations, ranging from the modern dating world we live in to hot-button topics and even a little bit on woke culture and whatnot! It's even surprisingly touching, heartfelt, and outright emotional at times, especially in the second half. But overall, it's a most welcome and refreshing take on what one might come to expect from a romantic comedy in this day and age. The way I see it, I'd categorize it as more of a self-love film, and you'll understand exactly why by the time the credits roll and there's possibly even a smile on your face like there was on mine.",

I definitely pushed myself too far this festival and hit a wall. I stayed at the worst airbnb imaginable where the place was covered in dust, was next door to a frat house and I could only get two hours of sleep, so that certainly didn’t help either. I spent most of the morning being **** miserable and just trying to stay awake. And then this movie started and I had goosebumps from the first frame to it’s last. I felt invigorated for every minute of it’s 2 hour runtime and just sat there with a dumb smile on my face even during the film’s most painful moments because I knew I was watching something that would mean a lot to me for years to come.I don’t have any analysis rn, I’m just happy when a movie can make me feel this way. Oslo, August 31st was one of my favorite films of the 2010s and somehow Joachim Trier has crafted something at a completely different register but every bit it’s equal. This is easily my favorite film of the festival, it’s gonna be near impossible to beat as my film of the year. Movies rule, man, I’m so happy right now.EDIT: Alright, it’s been 2 days so I’ll expand a bit. If you follow the work of Joachim Trier, since he 2006 debut, Reprise, through 2012’s Oslo, August 31st, and finally this film he’s been creating a very loose trilogy defined more by themes, location, and actors than by some overarching narrative. And the stories he’s been telling have simply been these kind of very true to life films about young people trying to navigate the world and more specifically in his native city of Oslo. He’s had a real knack for capturing the kind of experience of being a millenial better than probably any filmmaker I can think of and has done so with a real empathy and humanity. Sometimes those portraits of life can be really bleak like his prior film Oslo, August 31st but they all feature moments of breathtaking beauty and this is perhaps his warmest and most stunning yet. It features all the ideas essential to his work of identity, nostalgia, love, ambition, and interpersonal relationships with as much care as his work ever had, but with his age, he seems to now have enough distance to both be wiser in his observations and find the inherent comedy in the concerns that seem to dominate our lives in the moment. In this one it centers around Julie, a young woman who having just turned 30 finds herself still unsure of her place in the world unable to find any real home in her professional or personal life. And as we see the next few years of her life the film doesn’t cop out and provide easy answers but ends with a resolution that rang true and that I found extremely touching.Idk, I’m still on a high from this one, I’ve sat here for two days now just listening to the soundtrack on repeat and desperately googling for a release date so I can see it again.As of now, this is my first 5 star film of the decade. I’ll say it again, movies rule, man.",

Telling the story of Julie (Renate Reinsve), as she navigates through her complicated love life and her struggles to find a career path that she can remain passionate about. Told in twelve chapters, The Worst Person in the World takes place over four years in Julie’s life. Renate Reinsve gives an absolutely stunning performance and the fact that she wasn’t nominated for an Oscar is madness. Granted not the worst thing to happen at the 2022 Oscars but still, pretty close.I felt like I was watching Julie’s actual life play out in front of me, Reinsve completely disappeared into the role. The Worst Person in the World was a breath of fresh air in an otherwise tired out genre. Not your typical rom-com at all, it’s far better and deeper and gives a very realistic portrayal of life and relationships. It also may trigger some real fears among some of you, particularly those also trying to navigate the scary world of dating and relationships in your late twenties/early thirties.A simple idea and told in a way that has the viewer completely engrossed in the story. It’s actually refreshing to see just how good a rom-com can really be and not this fairytale fluff we normally get. This is real cinema. I wasn’t at all sure what to expect before watching The Worst Person in the World but like most people I’d heard great things about it. Needless to say it’s brilliant and I loved it. If you’re the type to cry at movies then you might want to have the tissues handy. Highly recommended.",

Or perhaps of their way of not facing, if they consider themselves powerless spectators who are just allowed to photograph the reality judged to be immutable. Too many things are left in the background and the most important ones: the comparison with the parental generation, the relationship with the spirit of the time that transversally involves everyone (even if it is those who grew up in that precise period who symptomatize it better), the relevance of the novelties with respect to the constants of History. Obstacles that have undermined the cinematography of who knows how many authors, from Rohmer to Allen to the exponents of mumblecore.
