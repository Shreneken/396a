  "critic_reviews": [
    "This grounded, frequently brutal and nearly three-hour film noir registers among the best of the genre, even if — or more aptly, because — what makes the film so great is its willingness to dismantle and interrogate the very concept of superheroes.",
    "The two stars generate an astonishing sensual charge in a brilliant addition to the Batman canon that refuses to behave like a blockbuster",
    "Matt Reeves’ violent, thrilling, darkly beautiful take on The Batman more than justifies its place in the franchise’s canon.",
    "Matt Reeves’ The Batman should tell audiences that other superhero movies are possible, and yet more, they can be had outside the formulaic tentpoles filling theaters today.",
    "Reeves has created the best iteration of Batman in years, in a film that examines the humanity behind the character. And it’s one that I would like to see again and again.",
    "Do we really need yet another \"Batman\" reboot? The answer, after watching Matt Reeves' tremendous The Batman, is apparently a resounding yes.",
    "What Riddler is doing is nakedly political, and there’s a risk that the audience may fall for his persuasive, butcherous way. Yet in the rebuttal to the Riddler’s conundrum, Reeves give this Bruce Wayne something more meaningful than an origin story: He gives him redemption.",
    "In its uncompromising vision, it may not be for everyone, but it’s definitely the movie that Batman needed.",
    "Pattinson and Kravitz bring real heat to their scenes together—there’s a great moment where he holds her against his chest as they’re hiding from a pursuer and their breathing slowly, erotically falls into rhythm. Even at three hours, the movie could use more of her.",
    "At a time when many comic book franchises are seeking to go bigger, with cosmic beings and multiverses, The Batman’s down-to-earth approach offers a welcome reprieve.",
    "Pattinson’s main man holds down a revamped Gotham that feels distinctively gritty with its blueprint of madness and mayhem, a place you would never want to live in but still would love to revisit as soon as possible.",
    "This is the most beautiful Batman movie you’ve ever seen—even if it’s not really a Batman movie at all.",
    "With Pattinson glowering beneath his cowl, Reeves creates a Batman whose psychology is at least as interesting as his crime-fighting activities, for the first time in a long time.",
    "In an era of superhero gluttony, in which these familiar stories, characters, and visuals tend to bleed together, The Batman holds the rare distinction of creating and embracing its own identity.",
    "Grimy, slick and genuinely frightening in true horror-movie fashion, Reeves’ new film reassembles the best elements of Batman lore into one overwhelming and epic-length package. Almost everything here works – not despite our current overload of Batman culture, but because of it.",
    "What this film does achieve is telling a solid new Batman story, one with some pretty compelling twists and a strong point-of-view on who, exactly, the Caped Crusader is. By default, that makes it one of the better Batman movies ever made.",
    "The film is strongest in its first half but the double act between Wright and Pattinson sustains throughout: never has the Bat-Gordon partnership been so well-realised. Inevitably the door is left open for sequels, but The Batman stands up as an incredibly satisfying, grown-up vision of its own.",
    "The Batman is a thrilling, ambitious, and exhilarating reboot for the comic book icon. It might not be the Dark Knight's best-ever movie, but it comes mighty close.",
    "Those first two acts feel fresh and different. I loved Pattinson’s take. He’s not a pretty boy, he’s a conflicted human being. He’s a hero who’s not so super.",
    "The film, playing in theaters, is very long, relentlessly intense, murmured more often than spoken, and photographed, by Greig Fraser, with a glowering gorgeousness that must be seen to be felt. It’s also enthralling and tailored to our time, an extended rumination on finding one’s moral compass in a world of all-encompassing evil.",
    "Although it does disappointingly go over the top on occasion, there’s just too much depth and style to The Batman for it to be anything other than a success.",
    "It is, in short, a film to scowl to. But if you can lock into that moodiness, it’s also quite enthralling.",
    "Director Matt Reeves and star Robert Pattinson see the Caped Crusader as more film-noir detective than comic-book hero in their mesmerizing mindbender that aims high even when it misses the mark. It’s a grenade of pure cinema ready to blow.",
    "Matt Reeves’s take on the Caped Crusader may not be a genre-defining miracle, but it delivers a tapered-down, intimate portrait, while Zoe Kravitz’s Catwoman brings an almost-extinct sensuality to the role.",
    "Reeves loves these dead-end apocalyptic environments, and delights in tales that toy with the moral calculus of typical hero narratives. He has given us a Batman that he himself can believe in, not to mention a Batman that feels right for our times.",
    "Matt Reeves’ arrival in the Bat-verse is a gripping, beautifully shot, neo-noir take on an age-old character. Though not a totally radical refit of the Nolan/Snyder era, it establishes a Gotham City we would keenly want a return visit to.",
    "A gripping, grimy and sensational street-level detective story, the Dark Knight’s triumphant return is exactly the fresh start needed after a decade of diminishing returns.",
    "As much as is possible considering all the Dark Knight films that came before, The Batman feels like its own creation, not beholden to past instalments while still honouring what remains riveting about this character’s milieu.",
    "Swelling the running time close to three hours, the story, though well worked, has ideas above its humble station. One longs for the strings to be tightened. One yearns for just a smidgeon of levity.",
    "Director Matt Reeves has mixed up gritty mob drama with film-noir detective thriller – and thanks to Dano’s ultra-creepy villain, some psychological horror too. Most of the time it comes off brilliantly.",
    "This glowering study in crime and punishment is meticulously crafted, vividly inhabited storytelling with a coherent, thought-through vision, and that makes for muscular entertainment.",
    "With exhilarating action scenes, a layered story & poignant, in-depth characterization, The Batman is a worthy addition to the live-action DC slate.",
    "It's more of a detective mystery than previous Bat-flicks, borrowing in particular from David Fincher's serial killer chillers Seven and Zodiac. And it's a gangster movie. Also a '70s conspiracy thriller. And a relentlessly bleak film noir. Most of all, though, The Batman is a horror movie.",
    "Originally planned as a vehicle for Ben Affleck’s bland Batman, Reeves’ version hits left of center, offering a vision of the character not yet explored on film.",
    "There’s real filmmaking here in The Batman. Matt Reeves, the director and co-writer, has a serious interest in the tantalizing Batman/Catwoman dynamic. His script, in collaboration with co-writer Peter Craig, parcels out the action sequences carefully, and when they arrive, they’re both visually lucid and excitingly reckless.",
    "Batman as a straight-ahead film noir anti-hero – just psychos and murder, no end of the world scenarios - is an idea that’s overdue. It was the tone the original comic book set way back when. And for long stretches, The Batman gets it.",
    "The Batman isn’t revolutionary. It doesn’t upend the superhero movie dynamic. Heck, people used to the recent superhero movies getting more cosmic and playing around with alternate timelines might not even like this more back to basics approach. But I, for one, found it refreshing. A nice little breather amidst the chaos. And proof that a good story with good characters can go quite a long way.",
    "It falls on Pattinson's leather-cased Batman to be the hero we need, or deserve. With his doleful kohl-smudged eyes and trapezoidal jawline, he's more like a tragic prince from Shakespeare; a lost soul bent like a bat out of hell on saving everyone but himself.",
    "Still, the film sustains its seductive atmosphere—its hushed pop-noir cool—even as the story fizzles into a string of reveals and a curiously perfunctory climax.",
    "This is an urban-based Batman saga, and though the citizens of Gotham City have yet to fully appreciate it, they are lucky to have him patrolling their streets, their sewers and their skyline.",
    "In Pattinson, the producers have found a Dark Knight worthy of the hoopla, while creating a Gotham much in need of him. As new chapters go, it's a strong beginning; if only it had known when to end.",
    "By far the most nuanced relationship here is that between Batman and Riddler.",
    "It’s too long, and maybe there’s a little too much concern about the way Pattinson’s hair flops over one eye. But from first frame to last, Reeves matches the master, Christopher Nolan in two important regards. As in the last Nolan “Dark Knight,” this Batman is embattled and almost overwhelmed by a city and its institutions coming apart at the seams.  And like Nolan’s “Knights,” this beast of a movie looks, sounds and plays as epic.",
    "The film stands apart for thoughtfully suggesting that Batman might actually one day make Gotham a better place, and not merely a safer one",
    "I can’t say I had a good time, but I did end up somewhere I didn’t expect to be: looking forward to the next chapter.",
    "Reeves’ and Pattinson’s vision of the Batman as a Hamlet-like heir unable to move past the primal shock of his parents’ murder has a certain emotional power.",
    "Maybe he doesn’t have the cunning of Keaton or the brawn of Bale, but in his own unique way Pattinson’s Batman feels perfectly adapted for the uncertain and unjust times we are living in, where greed and impunity are the order of the day. And if the film itself isn’t totally original, it at least spreads its latex wings in some fun and surprising ways.",
    "I wound up walking out of The Batman with a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. The more I thought about it, though, the more I appreciated Reeves’ ambitions and his willingness to do something that wasn’t just more of the same old Batman. He really did make you see the character in a new way. Even the stuff in the shadows.",
    "At its best, The Batman is a helluva tough-guy yarn — an entertaining pulp-fiction epic under the guise of sure-thing blockbuster. At its worst, it’s the cinematic equivalent of a mixtape.",
    "There is nothing particularly bold about The Batman. Its strength is in execution.",
    "The Batman is ambitious and dedicated to its vision, but despite some rather obvious clues, it can’t crack how to make the World’s Greatest Detective seem like one at all. Rather, we just have another passable Batman, not different enough to outrun his legacy’s ever-growing shadow.",
    "The Batman is darkly dour stuff — potent but erratic. It’s as though the filmmakers, working in the very long shadow of “The Dark Knight,” have opted not to rival the moody majesty of Christopher Nolan’s genre-redefining 2008 film but instead to simply go “harder” — blacker, more cynical, a total eclipse.",
    "The Batman doesn’t plod, but it sure lacks a spring in its cinematic step.",
    "Zoë Kravitz is a highlight as cocktail waitress turned cat burglar Selina Kyle.",
    "The Batman is a moderately well-made film, with some appealing performances, most notably from its star, Robert Pattinson, and from its cryptically glamorous Catwoman, Zoë Kravitz. And it looks like a movie, which used to be something you didn’t even have to say: The Batman may be dark, literally—its doomy, underlit ambience comes courtesy of cinematographer Greig Fraser—but at least it’s pleasurably cinematic, a picture that creeps to the edges of the big screen with an operatic flourish.",
    "The reality is that there is probably nothing truly novel to be done with Batman at this point. He’s been thoroughly mined for both fun and pathos; try as Reeves and his co-screenwriter Peter Craig might, they can’t squeeze much higher-meaning blood out of a fatally depleted stone. Pattinson, moody and saturnine, does what he can, but he’s not afforded much beyond growling and scowling.",
    "It’s a movie of alternately promising and frustrating half-measures, in which Reeves’ shrewd storytelling instincts and the usual franchise-filmmaking imperatives repeatedly fight to a draw.",
    "And Pattinson? He’s solid enough, but the role seems to neutralise his greatest strengths, stifling his edgy, eccentric charisma under a morose, dutiful shell. He’s just another ever-searching crusader in a shadowy world. Hopefully next time he’ll be able to find the fun.",
    "The story also ends on a touchingly optimistic note, which is unusual for a Batman film. Who knows, maybe the next one won't be quite as gloomy. Pattinson might even crack a smile. But I wouldn't bet on it.",
    "The ending is tiresome and shark-jumping in the extreme.",
    "The Batman is impressively made. The acting is first rate, and the chemistry between Pattinson and Kravitz is magnetic. It’s meant to be an important statement. It’s just not a lot of, you know, fun. Or as someone famously put it in another Batman movie, Why so serious?",
    "The movie’s solid dramatic architecture is essentially uninhabited—“The Batman” is a cinematic house populated only by phantoms with no trace of a complex mental life.",
    "I don’t know about you, but this particular time in history does not seem like the moment for a movie that will leave you a) miserable and b) wondering why nobody in Gotham City seems to have heard of light bulbs. Your mileage may vary, but for me — who loved both the Tim Burton and the Christopher Nolan “Batman” universes — this one feels like an earnest but bloated misfire.",
    "The Batman is the first caped crusader adventure in a while to come off as completely purposeless. Christopher Nolan’s movies reframed the comics as realistic, psychologically complex tales of an urban blight, and Affleck’s Bruce was built to fit into a wider DC universe. The Batman is here just to ensure that Marvel has box office competition.",
    "The Batman wants so badly to be hard boiled, to be “a vibe,” but it attempts to squeeze in so much that it feels frantic.",
    "Welcome to “The Batman,” yet another lugubrious, laboriously grim slog masquerading as a fun comic book movie.",
    "What is this “fun” of which Selina speaks? It’s certainly not a concept that The Batman, dropsical with self-importance, and setting a bold new standard in joylessness, has much use for.",
    "Nothing that works here adds up to anything worth a long slog in a movie theater, watching Pattinson punching guys and knocking guns out of their hands. From start to finish, The Batman is mostly just a collection of bad ideas."

Building on a 100% neo-noir setting, amazing photography and an unforgettable soundtrack, Matt Reeves has created a powerful film with great sequences (Batman intro, church, car chase, Riddler-Batman conversation). Dano, Kravitz and Wright do their best, not envying their predecessors in the roles. Pattinson, for his part, is a very good Batman, although I would have liked to see more of Bruce Wayne, to feel more of his pain (probably Reeves' intention is to show you a Bruce Wayne still reluctant to fully show his \"scars\", maskless).The 3-hour running time flies by, which speaks very well of the script and its pacing, dosing drama, thriller and action. Not to mention the parallels with Zodiac and especially Se7en, both in particular elements of the plot, as in the main themes of the story.

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nIf you've watched The Dark Knight trilogy, you've already more or less watched this movie in a much better form. It borrows heavily from the themes and aesthetics of the Nolan films with an extra layer of depression and eyeshadow added for dramatic effect. While Batman assuming more of a detective role is indeed a welcome change, everything else feels like a downgrade from other movies. From dialogues so edgy you could cut yourself on them and a complete lack of saturation in the color palette to an absolutely repulsive version of Bruce Wayne that would be better off as the frontman of a grunge band than a charismatic millionaire moonlighting as a vigilante bat, the movie presents a rather unique, albeit out-of-character, version of the source material. The plot is decent, albeit dragged out, anticlimactic and littered with ham-fisted social justice sentiments. All in all, this movie feels like a great concept that is often tarnished by an eccentric director's vision and will to make it stand out from its predecessors in all the wrong ways. In an attempt to make it different, Matt Reeves forgot to ask himself if it is indeed going to be better. Nonetheless, it's an alright pulp-detective-superhero thingiemajig that you can enjoy as long as you can stay awake all the way to the end.",

The acting from the heavy majority of the cast is great, especially Pattinson when he's donning the cowl (less so as Bruce Wayne, where he comes off as kinda creepy), Kravitz, Paul Dano, and an unrecognizable Colin Ferrell. The riddles laid by The Riddler are both clever and digestible, the atmosphere around Gotham is very well-done, and the action choreography is fantastic. While it treads some similar ground to other Batman films before it, two things it does exceptionally well are making Batman do actual detective work and giving him a real character arc, something no Batman movie has really done before this one. Finally, in spite of the film's bloated runtime, it's paced really well and the pressure/intensity built up through the direction and score is great as well. While it could've been potentially streamlined a bit, The Batman should satisfy most comic book movie fans, as well as most movie fans so long as you're willing to enjoy the film through its 3 hour runtime.",

Spoilers through out, I’m just going to start with some minor nitpicks it’s got to deal with the length because when the Riddler is caught it could have honestly ended a little bit after that. Other than that it was actually really really good as a Batman movie, not as it standing up to the legacy of the Dark Knight. For the main man Robert Pattinson is actually really awesome, you can tell that even though he was Batman for only 2 years he strikes fear in the criminals and he can kick some serious ass. He also proves that he is very very smart during the crime scenes it’s awesome. Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman was also really really well done she has a heartbreaking backstory. The villains good lord, Riddler played by Paul Dano he was spectacular, he’s not only menacing but he was chaotic and he had some serious issues. Also the Penguin played amazingly by Colin Farrell he disappeared with the makeup on and he is one of the personal highlights. The action scenes are well shot especially the dark hallway scene just gorgeous. Also we are getting a new Joker and I don’t want that to happen it’s too soon because we just got the solo movie hopefully it’s just a cameo. Overall I was very impressed with the movie Matt Reeves did really well Pattinson did great, Kravitz, Dano, Farrell, the action scenes, the music, everything was awesome I highly recommend this movie, just think about it being a Batman movie don’t hold it anywhere near the Dark Knight Level.

But that does not mean that the film is perfect. First off, lets talk about the pros of this film. 1. Pattinson is a great Batman. More so, he is a great Batman that is just starting out as Batman. 2. It shows more of the detective side of Batman that people have come to know and love about Batman. 3. The action is phenomenal.

The cinematography is just fantastic, there was a lot of care put into the way the scenes were shot (using different angles,lightning, etc). The villain was also pretty alright even if he was a bit of a Saw copy. The cast was for the most part pretty great, was not a big fan of the guy who played Batman but he was still fine. The romance was incredibly forced and was acting not so well which just made me wonder why the hell it was even put there.l The biggest issue for me was the movies length, they could have easily cut at least 40 minutes of the movie and we wouldn't have missed anything. A pretty decent and more serious Batman",

It's similarly grounded like Nolan's Batman movies but much darker, grittier, and more brutal.  As a big fan of Batman graphic novels, this film felt more like a Batman film than any Batman movie that came before it (not saying it's the best Batman film).  The Batman's character arc was a highlight of the movie for me.  There were several moments in the first two-thirds of the film where I remember thinking \"this is just retreading ideas that I recall from Nolan's The Dark Knight,\" but the ending actually expanded on these ideas in a really refreshing way that I'm surprised Nolan didn't think of himself.  I'm very excited for the inevitable sequel.A controversial take, but not a negative critique is that the cast was simply good.  Not great.  Looking back what previous actors brought to the table, I don't think this cast did anything special.  Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Michelle Pfeifer, Danny Devito, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart, and Tom Hardy were truly memorable and awe inspiring in their total embodiment of their characters.  Although this could change over the course of the sequels, I think that most of the cast of this film don't achieve similar heights.  They are good, but not great.  Pattison really didn't have much to do other than walk, coldly deliver lines, grunt, and fight, but he did it all well.  Wright as Gordon didn't really bring anything new to the table in my opinion, but again his performance was solid.  Serkis as Alfred was completely forgettable and hopefully they give him more to do in the sequels.  Dano, Ferrel, and Kravitz were just short of great.  Dano spent most of the movie behind a mask and I often felt like his sporadic emotional fluctuations when delivering his lines were less frightening and more distracting - reminding me of every other actor whose portrayed the unhinged psychopath this way, pulling me away from the movie.  Ferrel's Penguin has me thinking The Batman is an earlier frontrunner for Best Makeup, but his character was nothing more than a club owning mobster.  Between the makeup and his performance, it could have been \"great\" if he'd have been given more to do.  The best part about Kravitz was the story and fight choreography.  But her actual performance felt like a retread of what's already been done and I didn't really feel any actual chemistry between her and Batman, so their intimate moments felt a bit forced.  Again, definitely not bad and her character's story combined with Arkham style fight choreography elevated her performance above \"good\" but just short of \"great.\"  The only character that I thought was \"great\" is someone I haven't really seen anyone talk about... John Turturro's Carmine Falcone.  Even with only a short amount of screen time, he stole most scenes he was in.  His delivery was subtle, yet intimidating.  He never took off his sunglasses, but you could feel his eyes penetrating each character he gazed at.  I don't think he's getting nearly enough credit for his role in the film.The only valid negative is that this movie was too long.  On that note, I don't know what I'd cut from it cause it really didn't have any filler.  I would love to see a director's cut that potentially cut the movie into 3-4 separate chapters/episodes like Tarantino's Hateful Eight.",

When the Batman spoke.. \"Thursday October 31st\"... yeaaahhh!!!! I'm a sucker for movie with narrations... right then I knew.... I'm gonna love this movie... and the investigation itself is very interesting...

Robert Pattinson are amazing and he really looks great in the suit... The Bat suit itself is menacing... Colin Farrell is the most amazing cast... I still can't recognize him behind the make up... his accent is sublime.  Paul Dano as The Riddler...chilling performance... he is crazy AF... I don't know what kind of Joker Matt Reeves gonna give if there's a sequel to top The Riddler.This is the best Batman movie I've ever watched... if you're a fan of MCU type superheroes movies... I don't know whether you would've like it... but if you are fan of criminal investigation movies like Se7en... this movie is heavily influenced by Se7en.. you definitely gonna love the movie.Highly... highly recommended... 10/10... find the best sounding cinema because you need to hear the introduction of the Bat Mobile... HOLY S#!T!!! Goosebumps... the revving jet engine make the hair on the back of my neck stand up!!!",

Lighting is okay. First flaw to me: the environment is way too dark. I totally get that it constitute a part of the Batman's core but here it is just too much. There are se few scenes shot under the daylight. It so dark that some scenes are hard to understand, because you can't easily visualize the position of objects and characters.Fight scenes are amazing, with some great choregraphies. I enjoyed the fact that Batman takes a lot of punches and bullets, making him seem more vulnerable, more human. Despite that fact, 'The Batman' manages to offer us spectacular scenes.We obviously can complain about Pattinson embodying this Batman, but I enjoyed his role even more since he keeps his mask on for something like 85% on the time. In overall he is quite good at non-acting: he is almost impassive for the total length of the feature. However I think he made a slightly different Batman: more sad, more tired and more beginner. Speaking of this, thumbs up to the new Alfred too ! I was highly skeptical at first glance but his relation with Bruce Wayne is totally different than in the previous movies. I was also positively surprised by Catwoman's role and character, I found her not too sexualized, not too seductive, emotional as I like, and properly introduced in the scenario. The villains are okay, excepting the Riddler which I found to be terrific. Even more, I am deeply satisfied with the evolution of the different characters. I don't have the impression to have watched a pointless regular action movie.I would have wanted more gadgets. For something as iconic as a Batarang, we see him use it once of twice maximum. What the heck ? He uses his grapple (or should I say Bat-grapple ?) way more often ! By extension,  the wealth of Bruce Wayne is nothing more than detail ! While it is supposed to be his very first mean to be a lawkeeper... The Batcave looks like a regular cave as the Batmobile just looks like a boosted, armored and reinforced Jeep.The scenario is quite boring and unoriginal. It sadly accentuate the fact that the movie lasts for more than two hours and a half. I found that the second third of it was the most boring. In overall it is really cyclic: Batman finds a riddle, solves it and goes to the meeting point, where he finds another riddle and so on and so on. He never tries to bypass the Riddler, never tries to do something unplanned. Fortunately the finale is worth it.There are notable inconsistencies. Several allies, including Batman himself, are exposed to close bombing, and they all miraculously survive. Bruce Wayne take an incredible amount of bullets without taking much damage. It seems like he possess a bulletproof and fireproof mask... Quite effective.I was disappointed by the fact that the movie tries to tackle multiple issues he can't really assume, as the death of Bruce's parents, the truth about his father and mother, the conception and origin of the Riddler, Gotham's politics, etc.The soundtrack is great, especially the use of 'Something in the Way' from Nirvana (terrific song by the way). Its presence is so overwhelming and iconic that I can't remember any other song used in the movie !In conclusion, many positive ideas and facts but I can't help to think that without its Batman label, this movie is just okay.",

With some help from Selena Kyle/Catwoman, he must dig deepHere we are... Another Batman movie, and yet ANOTHER reboot. In this one, Bruce Wayne/Batman finds himself up against various terrorist threats from the menace known as The Riddler. With some help from Selena Kyle/Catwoman, he must dig deep into Gotham's seedy underworld of crime and corruption while also targeting some of it toughest mobsters, such as the Penguin to find the answers he needs. When I first heard the news a few years ago that Robert Pattinson was in talks to don the cape, I was immediately skeptical, not because of his past with 'Twilight' believe it or not, cause he's actually a hell of an actor if you watch some of his past and most recent indie films that he's done ('Good Time', 'The Lighthouse', etc), but because I simply didn't think he fit the part and I couldn't picture him in such an iconic role to save my life. However, when the first trailers of him in action dropped, I was intrigued, my doubts swayed, and my mind opened. The more previews I saw, the more excited and hopeful I became. And after watching this very epic and VERY long (3-hr) iteration of the caped crusader, I certainly have a lot to unpack here, so I'll start with the basics like usual. For starters, anyone going into this with doubts about Pattinson needs to put those doubts to rest and try your absolute hardest to disassociate him from 'Twilight', cause like it or not, the man can act, and he gives an absolutely stellar performance here both as Bruce Wayne and Batman! He really opened himself up here in every possible way and exposes himself to every possible emotion, easily making him the most sympathetic, grounded, and vulnerable Batman we've seen thus far! And while I wouldn't go so far as to say he's my new favorite Batman, he's right up there with Christian Bale and more than earned his chance to take on what many consider to be the most coveted role in Hollywood. As for the supporting cast, Zoe Kravitz is stunning and impressive as Catwoman here, and Paul Dano as the Riddler is absolutely haunting and chilling! The only weak link and character here I found to be rather miscast, despite lots of makeup and prosthetics being applied, was Colin Farrell as the Penguin. While everybody else in the film felt like they were on the same dark and gritty wavelength as each other, only Farrell feels cartoony and hammy compared to the rest of the cast, and the guy's just too tall and handsome in real life to make for a convincing Penguin. I know I can't be the only one who wouldn't picture someone like him in the role first thing. Storywise, it's not the strongest, and I couldn't help but notice that it borrowed heavily from a lot of the gimmicks and tropes that we've seen in several past iterations of Batman films, including several from 'The Dark Knight' trilogy, so it couldn't help but feel a little cliche and derivative at times. And as for that epic runtime, I was already skeptical enough upon learning about how long it would be, and told myself that a runtime that long would NEED to be justified, but unfortunately it just wasn't. There are several moments and scenes that felt very much like padding to me, and this film easily could've trimmed several moments to make it a half hour or so shorter and it would've been great. However, I will say that the overall tone, mood, and atmosphere provided that gritty noir-style Gotham most of us have come to love and expect over recent years, and it was definitely enough to keep me invested and not too restless during its 3 hours. I also really enjoyed the score in this one as well! It's worth noting just how well it fit with the rest of the film and helping with setting the tone, not to mention its surprisingly effective use of 'Something in the Way' by Nirvana on a couple of different occasions. By the time the credits rolled, it's obvious just how much the studio wants to set things up for further installments in this particular Batman universe, and with an intriguing enough set up with this first film, I'd be willing to see where things go from here. Overall, there's not really any surprises here in the way of that gritty noir feeling and style from watching Batman, but despite a somewhat redundant-feeling storyline with a good amount of excess it could've trimmed, the tense atmosphere and score, as well as Pattinson's bold performance, along with several others in the cast are the main highlights here that make the film compelling and worthwhile enough, and perhaps might add just enough intrigue to see where things go from here.",

The story really was captivating to watch and held its own without needing to be packed full of action. Reeves used what few action scenes he had really well and managed to deliver a Batman that was truly terrorising when the time called for it and managed to avoid delivering beat downs that were high in ASMR and avoided drowning them in musical scores that we've seen popularized of late. There's nothing quite like seeing Batman slowly slink from the shadows in silent ambience and hearing his fists beating skin to a pulp as his victims scream in terror.Well done Reeves and Pattinson.",

WhatRobert Pattinson is obviously well known and a very good actor but he truly embodies the role like I have not seen since Christian Bale. He is fierce, intimidating, calculating and not someone you ever want to catch in the wrong mood. What you may not have expected however is that this is The Riddler's movie too and therefore a detective movie throughout.. perhaps the thing Christian's was missing the most of, Bruce is using his brain and quick thinking skills more here than he ever has in a live action movie. Selena Kyle played by Zoë Kravitz is perhaps the most shocking standout and has more to her than meets the eye and throughout her chemistry with Robert as Batman and Catwoman is the glue that holds this movie together. The villains of this movie are honestly what you would want. Cold. Hateful. Brutal. And of course.. loves to get on Batman's last nerve and make him truly think \"Does he really deserve mercy?\" BUT what keeps this movie from being a 10 was Paul Dano as The Ridder. Absolutely overacted the entire time and made me want to laugh in serious toned moments and that's a shame because for the first half of the movie he's great but that last half is just awful with his scenes. The most surprising thing about this movie is Bruce's psyche, his relationship with Alfred, his father figure, is heartfelt while also being somewhat realistic when a child experiences a tragedy and how to live with it and what he's going through the entire time and keeps you on the edge of your seat and his path to TRULY becoming the savior to Gotham they need and deserve. Matt Reeves has created not just one of the best detective movies I've ever seen but in my opinion a stronger first film than even Batman Begins and the best Batman movie since The Dark Knight Rises. Ladies and gentleman, Robert Pattinson is The Batman and we are in for some incredible films if this movie is the floor rather than the ceiling. We deserved this movie and everyone involved should be proud and excited for the future.",

And didThe hype is huge. On the one hand this is due to the ambition of what Matt Reeves has shown so far of his vision, and on the other it's due to those looking to judge Robert Pattinson and his interpretation of such an iconic character. And did The Batman deliver?I believe it did. Starting with the dark and noir tone and also its touch of Zodiac and Se7en, The Batman makes its identity clear.This is a Gotham rotting in its own decay of police and political corruption, while the gangsters control everything under the shadows.It has been mentioned countless times that we're seeing a young and still naive Batman, and while that is integral to the plot, the overall approach is to show the character as the detective, not the superhero. Something that not even Christopher Nolan himself knew how to explore. Robert Pattinson in my opinion does the job and presents a more than solid Batman. His Bruce Wayne appears very little and that one is nothing special. Zoë Kravitz was good, but she doesn't do anything special. At least she takes a more active role than Anne Hathaway did.Paul Dano perhaps plays too much the prototypical psycho villain that's smarter than the hero, but Dano is too good an actor to fall into that hole and manages to make a notable impression as the Riddler. Jeffrey Wright, John Turturro, Andy Serkis and Colin Farrell make up the rest of the characters who have more weight on screen and all of them do a fine job, with a special mention for Farrell who's completely unrecognizable behind that makeup and who can become an excellent villain in the planned sequels if given more to do. I don't know what plans DC and Warner have for their future cinematic universe, and with this film, they'll be under even more pressure because even though the events of The Batman are set in another universe, its style, tone, atmosphere and above all quality, completely set it apart from anything the studio has been doing since Man of Steel. Many may be fooled, but Batman is the flagship of both companies and is the one who has kept them in the game.So much so that even The Flash will have two Batmans present, and DC Comics has the market saturated with comics of the character and his allies. Here they are starting over with him and I was very happy with what I saw, and I'm more than excited to see what's next with Reeves and this cast at the helm. And as a small recommendation, if you can see it in IMAX, do it.The sound and images there are mind-blowing.",

A few cringe scenes. I think Colin Farrell did a perfect Penguin, it's crazy how much they changed his appearance, but the character just didn't resonate with me personally. I didn't feel a connection with that character. I also did not like Catwoman. I heavily recommended this movie. I will be watching more than once for sure. 8.5/10",

It is more of a Crime-Thriller and a fantastic adaption of the Comics. You can see that most of the scences look like comic panels from the classic Batman Comics like the Long Helloween which the Movie is inspired from. Even though the Movie is 3 Hours long i never had the feeling that it was boring or there were scenes that are not that important.I am sure that this is one of the best Batman Comic adaptions ever made. I am excited for the sequel",

There are so many mistakes in this movie along with a side plot that makes this movie an hour longer than the movie needed to be. The character are literally stupid, even the villain calls the out on it. The first half of the movie seems like a good detective story and keeps you interested. It all goes downhill after the car chase scene. The cat woman gets her backstory filled which takes away from bruce wayne public character being developed. There are so many mistakes that make no sense, such as him opening parachute before going into a bridge and ping - pong off of traffic. This batman is not intelligent at all. The penguin is the best part of the movie",

Aside from the cape crusader there only three characters who are not evil/corrupt- all of them are black. The rest? Evil greedy white men. The villains too of course. But what’s worse, the movie constantly breaks your immersion into it’s already disappointing world by injecting its biased politics (cat woman referring to Gotham as a city of white privileged men).  As a movie, THE BATMAN is mediocre at best. The first part feels like a big budget law and order episode set in the DC universe. There’s barely any action and it’s just too long.RIP batman, we’ll always have the Nolan (and Burton) movies.",
