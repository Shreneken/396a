  "critic_reviews": [
    "Though it may not be as iconic as the 1940s version, Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio is still astounding. Every character is fleshed out and filled with eccentricities lacking in prior versions. Themes of empathy, fascism, dealing with death, and learning to live again run deep within this masterpiece. And for all the complexities, the film is just plain enjoyable.",
    "As he did so ingeniously with “Pan’s Labyrinth” and the Spanish Civil War, del Toro explores fantasy, myth and childhood in a time of oppressive fascism; the specks of light that escape the darkness.",
    "It may go against its ethos to deem del Toro's Pinocchio an impeccable masterpiece, even if that's an adequate description, but know that if the art of making movies resembles magic, this is one of its greatest incantations.",
    "By changing the cautionary tale to be against assimilation and categorisation, plus its invigorating update of traditional technique, the film carves out a space not just as the best Pinocchio film of this year, but among the finest films the director has made.",
    "It’s a remarkably life-affirming message coming from a mess of animated puppets and a monster-loving filmmaker.",
    "Ultimately, it’s the film’s sheer strangeness – that peculiarly magical, lapsed-Catholic sensibility that runs throughout all of Del Toro’s most personal works – that makes this sing and fly.",
    "Pinocchio feels like the best mix of classic del Toro and new del Toro, with the wisdom and melancholy that comes with age and experience, yet his bright-eyed love of fairy tales from his Spanish-language films. Perhaps more impressive is how Pinocchio pushes the oldest form of animation to new places, and like the puppet himself, breathes life into inanimate objects.",
    "A film which doesn’t sugar-coat the ache of bereavement, the futility of war or the manifold failures of mankind, but which manages to balance the darkness with sparks of hope, humour and humanity.",
    "Through the eyes of the Mexican filmmaker, the familiar fable is made anew, carefully carved by the hands of an artist eternally enamored with his craft. This loving relationship between creator and creation imbues the film with the type of contagious excitement that brings one back to the joy of the early days of cinemagoing, a thrilling jolt of nostalgia that only emphasizes the miraculous nature of this fresh recreation.",
    "Looking and feeling every inch like a film made without compromise, Pinocchio was worth the wait. Del Toro has been talking about making the film for most of his career now, and the pay-off shows in every brushstroke and thumbprint.",
    "The stop-motion musical is an artistic triumph that colors Collodi’s cherished storybook characters with humanity and depth to craft a mature tale about rebellion, mortality and the love between a parent and child.",
    "It’s easily one of the best animated films of the year, and one of the most assured, endearing works of del Toro’s filmography.",
    "Several directors have told the tale of Pinocchio over the years, but none have been anywhere near as successful in reimagining it to fit their own sensibilities. Del Toro putting his own name in the title isn’t a move motivated by ego—nobody else could have made it but him.",
    "Guillermo del Toro sprinkles his signature dark whimsy on a fairytale classic with stunning puppetry and catchy original songs. Filled with heart, humor, and historical grounding, it’s a phenomenal feat of animated cinema.",
    "You’ve never seen a Pinocchio like this one, a funny, touching and vital masterpiece from del Toro that uses stop-motion animation to create a world of beauty and terror to get lost in. The Oscar for best animated feature belongs right here.",
    "Pinocchio is more than a movie about a wooden boy’s adventures. It’s a movie, to quote Sebastian, about “imperfect sons and imperfect fathers,” the futility and impotence of fascism, and the transcendent power of love above everything else. While a lesser movie would have been crushed by the weight of these themes, Pinocchio manages to carry them all with relative ease.",
    "It’s intense, creepy, often harrowing stuff, so you can see why del Toro has said in interviews that his Pinocchio isn’t a children’s film. But that doesn’t mean that brave children, and brave adults, won’t adore it.",
    "Overall, I wouldn't say Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio is a \"dark\" movie so much as it is a challenging one — refreshingly so, with knotty, complex questions and real peril.",
    "I feel tempted to say there’s a leaner, stronger film inside this that could have been coaxed out, but in the light of the film’s message about accepting people as they are, maybe we shouldn’t be shaming this film either. It is what it is, and that’s perfectly imperfect.",
    "Like all del Toro films, this Pinocchio thrives on a storytelling imagination that thinks outside the box.",
    "The best animated film Netflix has ever made, and the best animated film of 2022.",
    "[Del Toro's] wonderful new take on the classic tale is the most essential adaptation of Carlo Collodi’s novel since Walt Disney’s 1940 cartoon masterpiece, with a practically perfect mix of tragedy, comedy, adventure, parental worries, societal expectations, childhood precociousness and antiwar leanings.",
    "It’s as cheeky as it is morbid, and the two flavors play well together.",
    "To borrow a phrase from the movie itself, Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio is a “terrible joy.”",
    "The film is marked by wild flashes of invention, all born of painstaking craft and devotion.",
    "Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio shows that if you’re going to adapt this story yet again, it’s best to bring something exciting and new to it, as well as put some of your own personality into it.",
    "Carlo Collodi’s serialized story for kids may have inspired it, but del Toro isn’t going for fealty. He very much has a take, and if he creeps you out with it, so much the better.",
    "Deeper, darker, mordant, with a definite horror movie vibe, it is what you might expect from del Toro, a filmmaker who gave us Pan’s Labyrinth – essentially a dark fairy-tale wrapped in real-world fascism, as this is as well.",
    "It’s an unruly, wild, and tender film that sometimes gets lost but, by the end, finds its way to a very moving state of grace.",
    "The script, co-written by Del Toro and Patrick McHale, is perhaps a little slick when it comes to hustling the plot towards the next moral lesson. But the storytelling itself is unashamedly old-fashioned, and forays into the political and the macabre are all carefully tailored to younger viewers.",
    "Guillermo del Toro’s perspective runs through every frame of this unique retelling, which isn’t afraid to tackle troubling themes. A sincere, soulful exploration of what it means to be human.",
    "As you’d expect from the Mexican master, this is rich with macabre imagination and tiptoes between dreaminess and nightmarishness. In a contest with 2022’s other Pinocchio, Disney’s drab live-action redo, this wins by far more than a nose.",
    "Unfolding over a faintly indulgent but never dull two hours, this is a rare children’s entertainment that isn’t afraid to perplex kids as much as it enchants them, down to a coda that prompts a certain level of junior existential contemplation (not to mention a mournful tear or two).",
    "Although the 1940 landmark may work better as pure family fare, this slightly more mature film (which is by no means child-unfriendly) is artistically and narratively superior.",
    "It’s an artful, moving and often beautiful film, but be careful about showing it to young children; nightmares could ensue. (It haunted me, and I’m quite grown.)",
    "The movie is moving — the source material has been hanging around since 1883 for good reason — but del Toro’s better at the violence and the dark irony, better at revealing the ways in which this story was already sort of twisted.",
    "At times, the movie simply feels overstuffed, mimicking the episodic structure of the book—if very few of its particulars—to the extent that it can feel like you’ve nodded off and woken up in the middle of a different story altogether. But its inventiveness is so vivid that no matter where you are at any given moment, you’re happy to be there",
    "This loose retelling of Carlo Collodi’s weird and often unsettling 1883 fantasy novel (the screenplay is by del Toro and Patrick McHale) is a little too long, and hammers away too eagerly at its central idea: that fathers who expect too much of their sons can do untold emotional damage. Even so, del Toro’s creation is clever and lively and just strange enough to keep you guessing what’s coming next.",
    "It’s a lovely thing to behold, but who exactly is this for? Unlike Matteo Garrone’s sublime 2019 fantasy, a version that managed to be faithful, wildly imaginative and all-ages in appeal, this brooding musical veers wildly between primary school scatology, repeated journeys to the underworld and darkest history.",
    "It’s all plenty inventive and heart-conscious, grim without being punishing and, in its openness about impermanence and humility, could spark some significant parent-child exchanges about love, flaws and the necessity of meaningful time together.",
    "Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio is clearly not aimed solely at kids, but rather is banking on the fact that adults, too, will be drawn to the striking visuals and mature themes at play.",
    "GdTP starts out pretty slow and doesn’t speed up for far too long — it’s the rare movie that might accurately be described as more imaginative than good — but the occasional bit of inspiration like the tree-branch proboscis encourages the viewer to hang on. It’s a nose job like no other.",
    "True to form for the horror-loving filmmaker behind Oscar winners “Pan’s Labyrinth” and “The Shape of Water,” this is a dark affair, despite the occasional song. And yes, it’s a musical.",
    "Despite its beauty, several of those narrative touches don’t fully work, leaving behind a movie that’s aesthetically lovely but narratively uneven.",
    "The movie bites off way too much. It lumbers inelegantly between confrontations with grief and fascism. The performed seriousness of it all stifles most attempts at having fun, which makes this an even harder prospect for young audiences.",
    "To be honest, del Toro has thrown too much into the mix. For no compelling reason, for instance, and to unresounding effect, the movie also happens to be a musical.",
    "To be fair, del Toro’s “Pinocchio” does, indeed, get a lot of things right. It’s got a nice sense of humor, for example. It is ambitious. It has heart. Where it falters, however, is in its near-total absence of charm.",
    "It’s evident that the filmmakers wanted to create a different, tougher and putatively more serious Pinocchio than the Disney version that has been lodged in the popular imagination for decades. But the movie’s decontextualized and disturbingly ill-considered use of Fascism is reductive and finally grotesque."

The stop motion animation is stunning and I found the whole scenery marvelous. Ewan McGregor's Cricket is a massive highlight. He was so funny and every time he screamed or made some noise, I burst out laughing. I wasn't expecting this film to go in such a dark and awesome direction by the end. I couldn't believe this movie was made for just $35 million. It looks so much more expensive than it is and the creature design and especially the location of the finale is just simply glorious. Christoph Waltz is so deliciously evil as Count Volpe and he does some terrifically menacing voicework. Mr. Filch from Harry Potter/ Walder Frey from Game of Thrones does an amazing job as Geppetto and I loved his character. This is one of my favorite movies of the year!",

Now see Pinocchio like you’ve never seen him before. A stop motion masterpiece from directors Guillermo del Toro and Mark Gustafson in a heartfelt story of a wooden puppet who is magically brought to life in order to mend the heart of Geppetto, a grieving woodcarver.The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi has been adapted for the big screen numerous times with some versions more memorable than others. I think most people are nostalgic for the 1940 Disney animated version but very few adaptations have stayed true to the original source material. The 2019 Italian version of Pinocchio certainly took the story on the big screen in a better direction and of course Disney decided another live action remake was due and you can also see that version this year if you’re one of the few not yet worn out by the live action remakes. Yet if you only watch one version, it needs to be Guillermo del Toro’s interpretation. A passion project for years that no studio would fund has now finally been given its moment. So is it really as amazing as you’ve all heard? Yes it really is a masterpiece.Guillermo del Toro’s interpretation of the fairy tale is strongly focused on love, loss and the similarities between Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein. I know Pinocchio has been adapted a few times now but this is a unique take that completely reinvents the story. It’s a PG rating but definitely has a darker tone with a backdrop of 1930s fascist Italy. Although the focus has shifted from the original story, it’s still at its heart a tale about relationships between fathers and sons that may have you in tears on more than one occasion. With a brilliant voice cast made up of Gregory Mann, David Bradley, Ewan McGregor, Ron Perlman, Cate Blanchett, Christoph Waltz and the list goes on.The stop motion looks absolutely incredible. Honestly, this is cinema. If you have a chance to see this in a cinema please take the opportunity to do so. This is a project that Guillermo del Toro has been trying to bring to life for years and finally someone was willing to take a chance on it. Although I often give out about Netflix not giving their movies much of an opportunity to run in the cinemas for more than a week, at least they give directors the creative freedom to make the movie they want to make. It’s magical, funny and will pull at the heartstrings for sure. It’s dark, weird and wonderful which clearly has del Toro written all over it. I absolutely loved it.This one right here is the Pinocchio remake worth your time. Fantastic and a must see for Guillermo del Toro fans and anyone who loves an emotional fairy tale. Highly recommended.",

Rather than simply telling a by-the-book, sunshine and rainbows adaptation of the source material, this film chooses to be different through its setting (Fascist Italy, eerily reminiscent of when Del Toro set Pan's Labyrinth in Francoist Spain) and, more important, its tone and themes. This adaptation embraces the more mature aspects of the story by commentating on how important embracing the one life we do have and those who make it worth living, as well as the classic Pinocchio lessons of being good and courageous, and even then it puts a spin on this idea by saying you may need to break the rules once in a while to do so. Finally, I've got to praise the stop motion animation, which is very well done in this adaptation and truly matches the tone set. Overall, even though this is another adaptation of a story you've heard before, it's one certainly worth watching, especially compared to the haphazard and lazy Disney remake released earlier this year.",

It's actually heavily flawed, but the good aspects of it are all especially so. First and foremost - it looks great. I can't see it not winning the academy award for best animated. And not just because of the literal animation, but the dialogue is really good too. It's a little bogged down by the overall outline of the plot itself, but it's a consistently humorous and profound film. The voice acting was all really good, too. (I cannot believe that Cate Blanchett voiced the monkey. I didn't know who was even voicing anybody in this, and guessed that she was the blue spirits. I was wrong obv, but wtf - she's in it and is a monkey which has no lines) And as is true in most of Del Toro's films, you can tell he was passionate and cared about it.But - I was glad when it finished. It felt a little overlong, and as mentioned, a great amount of the plot was contrived and was inconsistent within its own universe. E.g, when Candlewick's neglectful Nazi father orders him to shoot Pinocchio, a well established immortal-puppet at this point. Chadwick's seen Pinocchio live the life of Mr. Bill, dying a few times, getting run over by cars, burned, etc. There's quite a few scenes dependent on tension based on no consequences for this absurdly happy-go-lucky invulnerable puppet. It's also jarringly tonally inconsistent. There's all sorts of scenes with fascism that's often ambiguous and confusing. Why is there a Nazi just hanging around Italy, barking orders and whatnot? Presumably because an Italian blackshirt might be too confusing for the audience, and they want to denote obvious evilness or antagonism. But the inverse happened, and I was trying to figure out the historical context the entire movie. Yes, I know, WWII. But so many things were historically contextually distracting, including the varied accents. The Nazi was voiced by the super American Ron Pearlman. Geppetto and Carlo/Pinocchio are British. And most other people are Italian, but not all. Yes, this is 'just a movie' but all of that on top of weirdly ambiguous (though not always, as obv seen with Mussolini himself)historical setting and happenings makes for a distraction.Gepetto, not looking a day over 75 loses Carlo in WWI. Then WWII rolls around and he still looks like a spry septuagenarian.The music, frankly, kinda sucked. Granted, I dislike the majority of musicals anyway. But there's too many songs, and they all sound like generic musical songs. All entirely forgettable. Despite all these complaints, I truly did enjoy this film. It will linger with you, and many of the scenes and imagery are unforgettable.",

Of course it is. This Pinocchio has an identity all of its own, not only in its animation but also in its style, its craftsmanship and its voice cast.It's true that Del Toro shares director credits, but this project is so much his own that his name is attached to the title.This is his vision and he has brought it to life in a way that makes for an amazing spectacle from start to finish. It's not perfect, nothing really is, but it's a film that deserves all the attention it can get, no matter what kind of audience gets the chance to see it.",

This week Netflix released Academy Award-winning filmmaker Guillermo del Toro’s reinvention of Carlo Collodi’s classic tale Pinocchio. As you know, the tale goes by aI’m a reeeeeal movie! *Pinocchio classic voice* Welcome back Streamers. This week Netflix released Academy Award-winning filmmaker Guillermo del Toro’s reinvention of Carlo Collodi’s classic tale Pinocchio. As you know, the tale goes by a wooden puppet is magically brought to life in order to mend the heart of a grieving woodcarver named Geppetto. Del Toro’s and Mark Gustafson stop-motion musical follows the mischievous and disobedient adventures of Pinocchio in his pursuit of a place in the world. Well let’s get to it.This is one of those simple reviews. Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio is beautiful, heartbreaking, and fun movie. So much so that it actually makes no sense why the movie wasn’t exclusively in the theaters. I mean this isn’t really a December/Christmas movie but it’s definitely one of those movies that just needs to sneak in before Award Season ends for the year. So what to say about Pinocchio. the stop animation is top notch, creative, and realistic at the same time. I mean just the typical for del Toro. This new version of Pinocchio brings the old story . With the storytelling and the voiceover work the movie gives the movie life. The innonnce and naivete of Pinocchio, the desperation and hope of Gepeto, the callous and unforgiving of Podesta and conveiving and cunning of Count Volpe just shoot of the screen. It’s easy to say that with the voice work of a great cast of the likes of Christoph Waltz, Ron Perlman, David Bradley, and Gregory Mann in reverse order. Just to name a few because Ewan McGregor’s Cricket just sounded a bit too like himself to be believe able. ANy way, you need those type of performances when this is a long told story like Pinocchio. The imaginative artisty along with the voice work make this feature its own.Ultimately, Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio is a must-see movie. The animation is inventive and beautiful. While the Pinocchio story is basically the same, this movie zones in on the emotional connection between father and son and a desire to be a better human being. Make sure to have a big box of popcorn and a few tissues when you watch this on Netflix.",

The effects and puppetry was pretty amazing and they way they retold the story was also pretty great. They were some parts that were left unsolved for some reason which was a bit disappointing. There were like 3 songs which I did not fully enjoy to be honest and the Sea Part was not looking that good in terms  of effects.

As for everything else? Nothing leaps out of my mind if I'm honest, even within 30mins of watching it. I personally found the design of the titular character to be 'just' OK, same goes for Sebastian J. Cricket & Co.I did like the casting of Ewan McGregor and David Bradley, particularly the latter. Christoph Waltz, meanwhile, is alright in his role. The more serious vibe of the film is a positive, though I don't think it comes across as deep as it intended (e.g. that last line from Cricket isn't, in my opinion, as effective as the film seems to think it is). As for the music: fine but forgettable, for me.Again, it's passable. I just unfortunately didn't overly care as much as I wanted to for this story and its characters.

For this adaptation, he's forsaken the Disneyfied version to stick closer to the original book. While much of the basic plot is the same, there are some different approaches like setting it in Italy during Musolini's rise to power. There are also a few extremely inert songs that just slow things down. Del Toro's love of creepy character design plays out here, even in the look of the wooden boy (with echoes of Marvel's Groot). While the animation is attractive, the purpose of this film isn't clear.

I stress: historical totalitarianisms and not current ones. Who cares? Why is he so incapable of broadening his discourse as Don Milani in \"L'obbedienza non è più una virtù\" (\"Obedience is no longer a virtue\", 1965)? Why, to condemn blind and uncritical puppet-like obedience, does he parasitize Collodi instead of inventing an original story of his own? Does he exploit the brand? \"A woody film\" (Valerio Sammarco). \"I cannot pontificate about it, but by the time I'm done, I will have done one movie, and it's all the movies I want.

You make one movie. Hitchcock did one movie, all his life\" (del Toro, \"Twitch Film\", January 15, 2013).
