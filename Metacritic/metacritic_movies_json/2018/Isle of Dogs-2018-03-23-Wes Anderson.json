  "critic_reviews": [
    "As wonderful as Fantastic Mr. Fox is, Isle of Dogs represents a leap forward for Anderson and his extensive team of stop-motion animators.",
    "While Isle of Dogs can be enjoyed simply for its surface pleasures -- its unique story, its singular voice and its gorgeous animation -- there are elements there that will appeal to those who want to dig deeper. That includes an argument in favor of an aggressive and adversarial press, as well as a fairly glaring distrust of government.",
    "The film is not only hilariously entertaining, but also firmly in the tradition of such political parables as George Orwell’s “Animal Farm.”",
    "This one follows its own goofy rules, fills the screen with astonishing images, tells a touching tale of outcast dogs and a faithful boy, and does so with ultralively deadpan wit. My only regret after seeing it at a screening was that I couldn’t stay and see it again.",
    "It’s a series of moving paintings, tableaux vivants, a goofy dog comedy, a grim totalitarian allegory. It’s sui generis. It’s the damnedest thing.",
    "That Anderson can still excitingly tell a new story within the structure of his unique visual language that we’ve gotten to know so well is just a testament to his incandescent genius. We don’t deserve Wes Anderson, but we should be eternally grateful he doesn’t seem to mind.",
    "The unique charm of Isle of Dogs is its bottomless vault of curios, its sly humor, playful graphic inserts and dexterous narrative detours.",
    "One of Wes Anderson’s best movies, an imaginative and amusing travelogue through incredible settings, populated by wonderful characters, with a lot of heart and even a little insight. You can feel the love radiating off of this movie, like a hug from your own beloved pet.",
    "It’s true that Isle of Dogs is a film about scapegoating, political hysteria, and deportation. But it is also—and at its best—a film about dogs. May they never go unpetted.",
    "There is so much to look at in Isle of Dogs that a second viewing is almost mandatory. You can forgive its fetishism. Mania this dedicated deserves its due.",
    "If this is a superficial tribute, it’s also an affectionately dense one. Most accurately, what we’re seeing is an Andersonian alternate universe: a Japan as old and new, real and unreal, steeped in pastiche and invented from scratch as the brownstone New York of \"The Royal Tenenbaums.\"",
    "The movie’s darker allegory of persecution and internment isn’t hard to miss, though, and the dogs themselves, with their tactile tufts of fur and Buster Keaton eyes, have an endearing, complicated humanity.",
    "The characters in Isle of Dogs may fight. They may get vicious. They may get hurt. They may get sick. But they also get nostalgic. They also get bashful. Their eyes also well up with tears when they reconnect with their loved ones, or when they first realize that love even exists at all. Just like humans.",
    "One does not necessarily have to be fond of canines in order to love Isle of Dogs, but it helps. It may also help to have a fondness for the meticulous craft of stop-motion animation itself or, even more interestingly perhaps, for Japanese cinema. It is a delightful, exquisitely-detailed production.",
    "Wes Anderson continues to exercise his (hopefully) endless imagination in Isle of Dogs, creating another fictional setting bursting with unlikely heroes and another unusually appealing adventure that offers more depth than meets the eye.",
    "Wes Anderson’s Isle of Dogs is delightful, giddy fun, but it’s more than that. It’s also insightful and relevant, all while existing inside one of the signature wildly creative, self-contained worlds Anderson creates.",
    "Anderson has a sharp grasp of slapstick and visual humor, and he uses deadpan about as well as anybody since the great silent comedians. But for all the laughs and the social resonance, Anderson and his team have first and foremost conjured a work of spellbinding loveliness.",
    "Isle of Dogs is the epitome of a heart-warming adventure; a funny, fantastic and thought-provoking tale set in a world where one man’s trash is another man’s best friend.",
    "So lush with gorgeous detail it’s like a piece of highly-textured haute couture, there’s also a sharp social message behind the elaborate seams.",
    "It is beautiful, lyrical, tragic, redemptive, and focused down to the last tick on a dog’s nose. His animated characters have all the grace, quirk, and charm of any live-action performance.",
    "It’s smart and different and sometimes deliberately odd and really funny — rarely in a laugh-out-loud way, more in a smile-and-nod-I-get-the-joke kind of way.",
    "It’s clever to the edge of brilliant, and damned funny, start to finish.",
    "Anderson’s gorgeous stop-motion animated film is much more than just a transdermal patch for America’s cuteness addiction. Instead, he’s crafted a wicked smart satire of moronic local politicians that fits in snuggly with his eclectic oeuvre.",
    "As for the animation, it's spectacular in every sense of the word and lifted by a superb Alexandre Desplat score, featuring taiko drums, that marks a new career peak for the Oscar-winning composer of \"The Shape of Water.\"",
    "Few directors are better at endings, at tying things up in a neat little bow like Wes Anderson, and Isle of Dogs, like many of his movies, ends strongly enough that you’ll forgive a little dragging, a bit of narrative floundering, throughout the middle section.",
    "As far as representation goes, the stunning, brimful, extraordinary Isle of Dogs can’t really be said to do anyone’s culture a disservice. Except cat lovers, who should probably mount a boycott.",
    "The staggeringly well-crafted Isle of Dogs is nothing if not Anderson’s most imaginative film to date.",
    "A barking mad shaggy dog story with imagination to spare. 13/10, would watch again.",
    "As much as the movie is an enrapturing, sometimes overwhelming experience, filled with passion and hard work and adoration for the impossible task of making such a singular movie at all, Anderson and his animation team find the film’s soul in these dog’s eyes.",
    "As ever with this filmmaker, symmetry is a hallmark, though both visually and narratively, this busy film lacks the serenity and jaw-dropping beauty of The Grand Budapest Hotel. Nor is Isle of Dogs as well-rounded and satisfying as Fantastic Mr. Fox. But as its curious canine cousin, it’s a movie that Anderson fans won't want to miss—as if they could anyway.",
    "Time and again, Mr. Anderson pulls you hard into Isle of Dogs. His use of film space, which he playfully flattens and deepens, is one of his stylistic signatures; he likes symmetry and, in contrast to most directors these days, does a lot inside the frame. He’s especially inventive in this movie, and I could watch hours of its noble dogs hanging out, sniffing the air.",
    "That is a beautiful riff, worthy of Chaplin, on the inverted values of a world gone to rot, whereas the gags in Anderson’s film are more about themselves, delighting in the literal and the overparticular.",
    "It’s hard to resist Isle of Dogs’ energy and wit, the filmmakers’ evident joy in exploring the miniature world they’ve imagined.",
    "If you’re playing Wes Anderson bingo, you can tick off ‘droll whimsy’, ‘visual pizzazz’ and ‘Bill Murray’. Yet, thanks to the Far East setting and a rollicking story, this is a fun and fresh-feeling experience.",
    "If mounds of garbage aren’t quite what viewers have come to associate with Planet Wes, the slight scuzziness of Isle of Dogs is its great surprise: From the occasional eye-watering blurriness of its fast tracking shots to the loopy, laissez-faire nature of its storytelling, the whole enterprise might just be as messy as the director lets himself get.",
    "The film is packed with laugh-out-loud moments, full of deadpan observations – a quintessential Anderson touch – and exciting sequences.",
    "This is by some measure Anderson’s weirdest concoction ever, in all sorts of good ways. And it probably counts as his most daring, too.",
    "There is so much detail in the breakneck race from image to image that Isle of Dogs will reward multiple viewings as much as any Anderson film, visually if not narratively.",
    "What’s frustrating about this worthwhile movie is pretty simple: All Anderson needed to do, really, was to let more of the characters, dog and human, female and male, have a say in how the story gets told.",
    "Isle of Dogs is a fascinating (and furry) place to visit, but visit is all it does. It’s a good boy. But it’s not a great one.",
    "Free to create practically any whim, Anderson requires a bit too much narratively of himself and brainstorming buddies Jason Schwartzman and Roman Coppola. Their plot scrambles keeping pace with inspiration, eventually surrendering to commotion and holding on for dear clarity.",
    "The chief pleasure of Isle of Dogs is admiring its lovably tactile stop-motion creatures (more than 1,000 rendered characters, a stop-motion record) and meticulous backdrops, giving the movie a deep-focus depth of field uncommon to animation.",
    "At its best, the movie expresses an affection for dogs and is very much attuned to what is wonderful about dogs and what’s funny about them — their sincerity, their credulousness, their odd tendency to get nervous over nothing and yet to occasionally remain oblivious to real threats.",
    "Anderson once again creates a uniquely whimsical visual environment; this time, it’s inspired by the classic Samurai movies of Akira Kurosawa and the stop-motion Christmas specials of Anderson’s childhood.",
    "A deep and adventurous exploration of canines as man's (and one particular kid's) best friend.",
    "While Isle of Dogs is basically a fizzy, ornately mounted assembly of quirks and barks, the sheer artistry displayed—in everything from Alexandre Desplat’s taiko drum score to the occasional bits of stunning 2-D animation—is so expertly accomplished, and so clearly fueled by love, that you can’t help but grin.",
    "It’s a mostly enjoyably overstuffed model kit of adventure ingredients: talking dog heroes, an intrepid boy aviator, an outspoken girl reporter, garbage playgrounds, mechanical worlds, robot peril and mischievous humor. It’s even, for this director, tantalizingly political, venturing into dark territory about such utopia-bursting ills as bigotry and authoritarianism.",
    "If there is a reason to cherish this often captivating, sometimes irritating, unavoidably perplexing movie, it's that its mere existence seems to defy rational explanation. It is by turns savage and soulful, mangy and refined, possessed of an unmistakable pedigree and yet boldly resistant to categorization. It's a shaggy Frankenmutt of a movie, dressed in artisanal fur and infested by bespoke fleas.",
    "Isle of Dogs is full of delightful touches, but it’s not Anderson’s best. Nice fur, though.",
    "With a running length of 30 or 40 minutes, Isle of Dogs might have been brilliant. Unfortunately, this concept, although suitable for a short, is too thin for a full animated feature.",
    "In its own messy, slightly ungovernable way, this digressive bagatelle feels looser than some of Anderson’s most tightly controlled mis-en-scenes. But the story, for all its busyness, is negligible. The script feels less like an organic whole than an effort to keep building up a scrawny central premise until it felt like a movie.",
    "Anderson is clearly a massive talent working, again, in his prime. However uncomfortable, it's crucial to ask what gives him the right to romp around in all these signifiers in service of bespoke whimsy—but then the word for it isn't “right,” but rather privilege.",
    "Isle of Dogs...buckles under the weight of its own finicky whimsy. By the end, you might feel exhausted, like a border collie who’s worn a circular groove in the carpet. And you didn’t even make the movie–you only watched it.",
    "Isle of Dogs, though carefully crafted, doesn’t have much to say — and that’s what’s frustrating about the movie. Anderson has always been one of the most stylistically distinctive American directors, but at times it’s felt as if his fussiness was a way to wallpaper over a lack of new narrative ideas. Isle of Dogs doesn’t suggest an evolution.",
    "Isle of Dogs does not have a compelling story, and even worse, it has the most egregious examples of its director’s privilege since “The Darjeeling Limited.” This movie really pissed me off, and the only thing I found soothing while watching it was silently repeating to myself “the dogs are very furry.” Reminding myself of the film’s best asset kept me from walking out."

The animation of the film\"Isle of Dogs\" was a wonderful movie, with some very good performances and an exceptional narration and dialogue, the story is very emotional and extremely entertaining, and gives a special value to Japanese culture. The animation of the film was very good and the voices of the characters, very convincing, in fact, have chosen the cast very well. In addition to the dialogue of Japanese humans, may not be understood at all but thanks to their translations, easily explains everything that happens. In this film, the dialogues adhere to the reality of our relationship with dogs, but we can understand it thanks to a meticulous analysis and a fluid connection between the characters in the film. The film itself sometimes feels like a documentary, but it does not affect its premise at all, and the interventions of the character of Greta Gerwig were unnecessary, but they have a greater contribution in history, besides leaving a great message about how we relate with the dogs and how we treat them. Maybe it's not a perfect movie, but it's certainly one of my favorites.",

And, of course, Isle of Dogs, as any Wes Anderson movie, has what distinguishes it from any other Wes Anderson movie. In fact, there are three new pluses here. First, and foremost, the visually storytelling. Yes, I know it's not a new thing to say about a Wes Anderson movie, but there is no Wes Anderson movie, nor any stop-motion animated movie that has used its visuals to tell its story in this way. Specially, when you know that this movie has many scenes where there is no dialogue in English, just in Japanese, or where there are just Japanese subtitles!The second great thing about Isle of Dogs is the voice cast. Sorry Fantastic Mr. Fox, I love you more, but here the cast really adds up to the movie. The cast isn't star-studded just because it's a Wes Anderson movie, but every single actor, or actress, really made every character feels distinctive. Bryan Cranston voices Chief, who is, by the way, could be considered to be the real protagonist, and Bryan is GREAT! Easily the best. But really all the cast shines in this movie. Edward Norton is my second favorite.At last but not least, comes the music score from the Oscar winner, Alexandre Desplat. It has some Western touch in it, along with a traditional Japanese music. What a wonderful soundtrack that sticks in our mind long after watching the movie!As I mentioned above, I prefer Fantastic Mr. Fox to Isle of Dogs. That's because Isle of Dogs, unlike any other Wes Anderson movie, is convoluted for its own good. That didn't hurt the movie as whole, except at the third act, which is quite rushed and messy. Also, I wanted the character of Atari to feel more life-like person. Because I felt he was overshadowed by the dogs, nevertheless, Atari is a well-developed character.Isle of Dogs may didn't live up to my expectations, but still it is my favorite animated movie of 2018 so far!(8/10)",

There is an air of self awareness about the story that, rather than disengaging, is used to draw the viewer more into the inherently ridiculous story. There is an artistry to suspending disbelief, and this is an endlessly creative way to get the audience to do so. To make them aware they're getting conventional information or that certain things are ridiculous plot details, even tropes, and highlighting such details to actually enhance the storytelling rather than distance the viewer. After a point you accept the strange pacing and rapid editing style as part of the universe of this film, and when you do , The Isle of Dogs is an audio-visual experience so cathartic you won't want it to end.",

The plot of this film has a pretty large scope for a stop motion film, covering an array of characters and subplots, with lots of heart and character development naturally integrated into it. The director seems to have struck a good balance between story and art. The characterisation of the dogs fit perfectly with the actual voice actors, with some of the dialogue feeling like they were tailor-made for Jeff Goldblum's or Bill Murray's character. The musical score adds an extra layer of lightheartedness to the overall feel of an already humorous and entertaining film. However, I do believe that there are deeper underlying themes surrounding political propaganda and how they can incite xenophobic fear and hatred. Is it any coincidence that this film was in development during the rise of Trump's presidency? In any case, Isle of Dogs can be viewed multiple times for its immaculately detailed aesthetics (as it is so detailed you will never see everything upon the first viewing) or you can simply enjoy it for a heartwarming tale of the endearing relationship between a boy and his dog. Isle of Dogs gets an 8.5/10.",

A man who has crafted and added to, not only a branch of the film industry within the independent market,Audiences around the world go to see a Wes Anderson film for many reasons; imagination, creativity, wonder and most of all, amazement. A man who has crafted and added to, not only a branch of the film industry within the independent market, but an individual who arguable has his own genre of film, proves with his latest that you are able to make an independent success, commercial darling and fading animation style feature film revolutionary. After eight feature films which enrich the medium as a whole, Wes Anderson delved, for a second time, into the stop-motion foray with his ninth future film, and quite possibly his best yet with Isle of Dogs. You heard the rumours right? About Isle of Dogs? Sure, there are a ton of rumours, controversy and discussions about the auteur director’s latest film, both positive and negative (which we will discuss further into this review) including some fun facts that if you say the film’s title fast, it’s actually the equivalent of saying “I Love Dogs”, as well as arguments about cultural appropriation, hmmm.The fact of the matter is, first and foremost, Isle of Dogs is a film that pays tribute and homage to so many of the things that Anderson loves and hold very dear to his heart. From his love to canines, to his homages to legendary filmmakers and vanguards Hayao Miyazaki and Akira Kurosawa, to his love of stop-motion animation; Anderson’s second venture into stop-motion animation is a film anchored by his passions, as well as a TRUE film for dog-lovers everywhere. DISCLAIMER: NO ACTUAL dogs were harmed during the making of this film–fact!Nevertheless, don’t let the animation fool you, Anderson’s Dogs is as convoluted a story and themed complexly as any other of his films.A true underdog story, the film follows a young Japanese boy Atari (Koyu Rankin) and his odyssey to save his beloved guard dog Spots (Liev Schreiber), a short-haired Oceanic speckle eared sport hound, who so happened to be the first dog to be sent to Trash Island, a fictional land outside of Japan’s fictional Megasaki City twenty years in the future, although the story seems more relevant now than it may in twenty years [hopefully]. Trash Island was sanctioned by Atari’s mayoral uncle, Mayor Kobayashi voiced by Anderson collaborator, who also served as one of the screenwriters, Kunichi Nomura. Kobayashi, following an age old dynasty that transgresses from his farthest ancestors, with strong pro-feline beliefs, sets course to sanction a law to deport all dogs to Trash Island, blaming “snout-fever” and “dog-flu” as an incurable disease for its people, despite two scientists (Ken Wantanabe and Yoko Ono) on the verge of a medical breakthrough with the cure.“What ever happened to man’s best friend?” indeed becomes one of the driving forces of the film. While Atari steals one of his uncle’s jets, the mayor himself Kobayashi, who serves as the boy’s ward following his parents tragic death years before, become family members and foes overnight. Questions arise as to why Atari on a quest to save Spots and deliberately chooses to throw his comfortable life away, despite Spots being one-helluva cute dog? It hurriedly becomes apparent that not only was Spots Atari’s loyal companion, but the pup also served as Atari’s loyal and trusted doggie-gaurd, despite Atari’s hesitations at first. Fast forward some time and Atari’s crash landing onto Trash Island, a desolate, ugly, grungy and garbage-filled wasteland inhabited only by dogs, populated with the brittle bones of animal carcasses, leftover waste, as well as spoiled and half-eaten food of Japan’s Megasaki, the journey becomes a young man’s ode to self-discovery and his ultimate moral fibre. Anderson, who so wonderfully, brings to life fantastical worlds in true Wes Anderson-esque fashion, seemingly chooses this story to showcase a very different side of his of his visual, truly allowing garbage, trash and waste to serve as a beautiful and poetic backdrop to his newest canon of films. Adding signatures such as Anderson’s symmetrical filming style, the use of pans and deep zooms, and Trash Island as well as the overly-populated Megasaki City fit right in with the rest of Anderson’s highly staged universe’s. It also becomes quite easy to see that Anderson is also pioneering himself into cinematic prestige; using Isle of Dogs as his Avatar, progressing and improving stop-motion, maturing the visuals of the medium as well as mastering the ways of its presentation, especially comparing it side-by-side to his first venture with the form in The Fantastic Mr.Fox.",

Wes Anderson has once again created a masterpiece of cinema that skillfully combines the highest comedy and the lowest tragedy into a delight for the soul. This is the best movie I have seen in theaters thus far in 2018, and one of the best animated films I have seen in recent memory. I can't recommend Isle of Dogs enough!The stop motion animation is charming and beautiful. The art direction and design is so specific and intricate that you'll find new things in each frame every time you watch the movie. There is beauty in the desolation of Trash Island, and the characters feel alive and real.Speaking of characters, the voice acting in this film is truly incredible. The Wes Anderson staple of a highly talented, highly acclaimed ensemble cast is in full effect here. Bryan Cranston and Greta Gerwig shine as the rough-around-the-edges stray turned pack leader and the American exchange student with a conspiracy theory respectively. The banter between Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, and Bob Balaban as the pack of alpha-dogs is simply delightful. Every single cast-member gets their moment in the spotlight, and it's a joy to watch.In terms of direction, there is simply no director like Wes Anderson. The man is a modern-day auteur, and every film he's ever made is unlike anything I've ever experienced. Isle of Dogs is hilarious, somber, whimsical, melancholic, and utterly beautiful. There is something for everyone in Isle of Dogs, from kids, to animation fans, to Wes Anderson fans, to the average movie-goer. If you get a chance to see Isle of Dogs in theaters, GO. Do not miss this one!",

When one boy comes to rescue his pet, it starts a journey that ends in the expected. As is usually the case with Anderson, the art direction is imaginative, inventive and delightful. The story starts with a quirky energy that's fun, but about half way thru, things get a bit precious and the pace starts to lag. This is filmmaker with a singular style, but it sometimes becomes too self-indulgent.  Still, Anderson showcases his unique approach to storytelling, character and visual style.",

His films always enjoy an added cachet that positions them far above manyThis canine-themed stop-motion beast wags its tail because of Anderson's filmmaking loftiness. Wes Anderson is not a cult artist, he's a prolific maestro. His films always enjoy an added cachet that positions them far above many only-entertainment flicks, and his latest classical animated jewel meets perfectly what one would expect from an indie author who has erected his sublime filmography frame by frame. It's neither a blatant cultural appropriation of East Asian culture nor a scurrilous Japanese stereotyped assortment drawn by an injurious foreigner, it's a beautifully hand-made and delicate love story, a widely different, a fertile pic in visible and veiled exclamations on freedom, press, politics, principles, fear, transformation, friendship and human and dog's life which feeds off from a top-of-the-range vocal cast and a visual and technical section as eccentric and neat as every of the narrative ambitions of a filmmaker who not only sets up a baroque addition to his exquisite filmography and artistic growth but imbues this high-concept film, with some complacency, of a razor-sharp, sophisticated allegory that is clearly geared to the grown-up minds, those who resist to consider art as a channel of trivial thoughts, not as a mechanism of inescapable contact and advancement. There's no doubt that for Anderson's style newcomers the first thing they will highlight is tangibility of the pictures. When the screening was over, the up-front reference that arose in my mind was the most recent piece of art of Laika Entertainment, \"Kubo and the Two Strings,\" not precisely by the concordance with the cultural basis or some moral similarities, but by the beautifully crafted creations, by being an invaluable gift for cinema, by the unspeakable visual prowess that hundreds of artists have built for us. The symmetrical compositions of the ever-perfectionist director who refuses to subdue his works under the phenomena of the digital age are straightforwardly glittering; a sharper aim to circumvent known superficialities and immerse it into the complicated, visually speaking, Japanese pulp places this film on a higher level in artistic terms, even unfolding the majority of the action on an adjacent island. More broadly, what decorates with personality the feast of strangely gorgeous frames is incredible and awardable cinematographer Tristan Oliver, rich in nuances and recesses endowing the pictures with irrepressible force which grows uncontrollably as the film runs, every frame is an authentic, finely crafted and shaped sculpture passing through the hands of hundreds of exquisite animators who with their talent, literally and figuratively, capture the obsessions of an animation maestro; a spellbinding experience. Anderson isn't only known for his peculiar and unpractical but extremely gratifying filming method, the textual motives that mobilize such handmade constructions intervene in the success of the narrations. The script is written undeniable by the American director because the characteristics of a concise writer arise, sensitive in a given moment, but coolly manipulative when the film itself requires it. With regard to the dicey, well-intentioned plot, it's conceived by eight hands with own name and recognition: Kunichi Nomura, in his first work as a writer; Jason Schwartzman, in his third experience as a film screenwriter; Roman Coppola, in one of the greatest successes of his career; and Wes Anderson, a man who doesn't need a description, just run and get covered with his artistic visions. The perspective he gives the story is simply unique, social and pleasantly revitalizing not only due to the fussy field of animation but the drama genre lines it uses with an unusual confidence in levels of conviction and coherence with respect to a plot that doesn't set in an explicitly human context, in the strictest sense of the word. \"Isle of Dogs\" by Wes Anderson mesmerizes from beginning to end, partly by its mania of playing with the high expectations always put on a director's job. Accessible and sophisticated, strategic and human, hilarious and dramatic, strangely beautiful and directed; this animated film is an undeniable love letter from the filmmaker to Oriental culture, canines and, beyond doubt, the recesses and perversities of the feelings, actions and inspirations of humankind; A feature film that produces juicy critical, controversial commentaries through generally opposed elements that are quickly woven on a story led by any manifestation of love, prioritizing narrative, technical and artistic fields with the proportionality only a maestro could handle. If you want to enjoy a good movie you will have many more options to choose from, but if you demand a top-notch film you will be welcome to watch as a stop-motion animation monster puts an actor, screenwriter, producer and director— uninterested in making movies for an Oscar — on the front page, a place he has never gotten out from.",

What should be mentioned are the pros of this very movie. And, of course, Isle of Dogs, as any Wes Anderson movie, has what distinguishes it from any other Wes Anderson movie. In fact, there are three new pluses here. First, and foremost, the visually storytelling. Yes, I know it's not a new thing to say about a Wes Anderson movie, but there is no Wes Anderson movie, nor any stop-motion animated movie that has used its visuals to tell its story in this way. Specially, when you know that this movie has many scenes where there is no dialogue in English, just in Japanese, or where there are just Japanese subtitles! The second great thing about Isle of Dogs is the voice cast. Sorry Fantastic Mr. Fox, I love you more, but here the cast really adds up to the movie. The cast isn't star-studded just because it's a Wes Anderson movie, but every single actor, or actress, really made every character feels distinctive. Bryan Cranston voices Chief, who is, by the way, could be considered to be the real protagonist, and Bryan is GREAT! Easily the best. But really all the cast shines in this movie. Edward Norton is my second favorite. At last but not least, comes the music score from the Oscar winner, Alexandre Desplat. It has some Western touch in it, along with a traditional Japanese music. What a wonderful soundtrack that sticks in our mind long after watching the movie! As I mentioned above, I prefer Fantastic Mr. Fox to Isle of Dogs. That's because Isle of Dogs, unlike any other Wes Anderson movie, is convoluted for its own good. That didn't hurt the movie as whole, except at the third act, which is quite rushed and messy. Also, I wanted the character of Atari to feel more life-like person. Because I felt he was overshadowed by the dogs, nevertheless, Atari is a well-developed character.Isle of Dogs may didn't live up to my expectations, but still it is my favorite animated movie of 2018 so far!(8/10)",

Visually stunning and immensely enjoyable.Set in Japan, Isle of Dogs tells the story of 12-year-old Atari Kobayashi and his quest to find his lost dog, Spots. After a serious case of dog flu every single dog has been exiled to trash island to live out the remainder of their lives. Abandoned by their masters and left to die. With the help of a pack of dogs on trash island Atari embarks on a journey in search of Spots. A brilliantly original story, filled with plenty of laughs and made all the better with stop motion.

However, Wes Anderson’s Isle of Dogs explains his ownChucking away people’s furry companions into a castaway of our own junk sounds unpleasant. If the government decided to pass such an act in real life, it’d be no laughing manner. However, Wes Anderson’s Isle of Dogs explains his own unpleasant reality for the near future in a strong sense of repugnantly clever dark humor.You maybe heard Japan historically made holy good fortune symbols out of cats: the maneki-neko (Fortune Cat) and the “Nambu Jinja” (Cat God Shrine) to name a few, well once upon a time, feline lovers declared war on canines, beneath Mayor Kobayashi’s command, due to an incurable dog flu and snout fever conspiracy theory, alongside canine overpopulation. Therefore, those dogs must live off rotten apple cores in Trash Island while everyone pushing the quarantine strokes a stink-eyed kitty in his lap. In this ominous future, dogs behave like humans, and humans behave like dogs, all in an inventive level of turning dogmatic excrement into gold more movies should reach.The set pieces diverge across modern Japan’s high-contrast imagery that brims the manageable branding of Harōkiti (Hello Kitty) into the monotone, not-so Kawaii (A Radiant Face) Trash Island with many garbage cubes signifying ultimate imprisonment. Green shows up almost nowhere in this feature, causing the entire island to glow of blood-stained muddy hues much like whatever your quadruped friend may have left on the front mat. If there is anything in the real world that would normally gag your reflexes, here, it instead exhausts beauty, say for instance, an illuminated glass bottle cave that silhouettes a dog pack who rest there for the night.Wes Anderson commands everything under his own mind game, as if he’s adapting the wartime manga series “Norakuro” (Stray Black). Claymation cinematographer Tristan Oliver uses the light scheme to artfully mimic a spotlight on Mayor Kobayashi’s control; the abandonment he details in each dense frame almost always positions pack leader Chief in center, the camera pivoting on an axis to draw our attention on each individual pooch.Chief leaves a greater impact than any other dog or human followed throughout the story, black from living through soot his entire life, zero nametag in sight. Each of the hounds’ other nametags help you to identify their souls behind their fleas, not their imprisonment number tattoos, a lot like the following of typewriter names recorded as the holocaust victims state themselves in Schindler’s List. One of these hounds, King, flaunts whiskers curled in a pompous high-class moustache fashion, just one small example of the stop-motion dolls’ memorable designs. However, amongst the maggots Chief’s pack must consume, they undeniably do little anything plot-productive. The standard American voice actors in part hurt it further, who never sound drunk off toilet bowl fluids as this film demands.Though Chief is an exception to the narrative flaws his pack carries; right from the start he needs a Hachikō (Eight-Affection) type hero, until Atari, a twelve-year-old in search of his guard dog, Spots, triggers a change in attitude. Although Atari has few thoughts about each dog he meets, the main relationship between himself and Chief surprisingly sweet, topped off by some handsomely animated tears built to churn your pancreas in sorrow.In this Japanese fantasy-dystopia, captions in parentheses accompany Japanese text, dialogue mostly media translated. The dogs’ barks are translated into English, ensuring easy international adaptation. To counteract the smog of pooch anti-paradise, familiar historical images of Japan include a Neko Jinja (Cat Shrine), Taiko boys, sumo wrestling, a Nō (Talent) production, and a humorously gross seafood bento box prep sequence.The Japanese murals here resemble toys recycled for affordable government-funded programs: a world where puppets control smaller puppets within perfect compositions that suggest political control upon whatever meticulous movement made. These fascist solutions, including robot canines built to replace regular canines, ends up less feasible than public lies, leading to few surprises why an Empire of Dogs might attempt rebellion toward the oppressive leaders’ theatrical playset.Unlike most propaganda, Isle of Dogs turn the nation against itself in a weirdly entertaining way which safely repulses you enough to take initiative. In fact, the matter will get so out of hand as you watch this show, you’ll need to go outside, vomit, regain yourself, then ask the nearest bystander out loud: “Whatever happened to man’s best friend?”",

The work that went behind the stop-motion is admirable and quite finely detailed too but when it comes to draw the emotions out from the screen, it isn't utterly adequate. The writing is strong, witty and fast paced (especially in its first act) which should have come off in its favor, but due to multiple characters and their sub-plots that it has to cover in such short runtime (around 100 minutes), there is very little space for the audience to breathe in. Wes Anderson's world is definitely different than its usual features and the irony in here is that, \"this\" is a simpler and asymmetrical one . A decent job on giving the voice by the star cast to these eerie characters and so was the choice on casting them. Isle Of Dogs is an intriguing feature to encounter where the execution is genuinely effective and lures you in within few minutes making the audience work for it and sweeps away its runtime like a charm but the only thing that itches you throughout the course is the writing which unfortunately isn't as convoluted as the makers think.",

And sinks to darker depths than it can withstand. Isle of Dogs is a stop motion animated movie that looks and feels like Fantastic Mr. Fox and many other Wes Anderson movies. But Isle of Dogs leaves behind Mr. Fox's clever humor and goes full dark on the audience. The trailers made Isle look like a humorous animated kids movie about talking dogs with a simple boy searching for lost dog storyline. This was a gross misrepresentation. Isle of Dogs is a dark meandering conspiracy drama with no momentum. It bounces from title card to title card for an hour and forty minutes, never building up any sense of natural flow. This isn't due just to the choppy, symmetrical visual style. It's due to convoluted, broken storytelling that is confusing even for adults. Kids will not enjoy this movie. There are several adult themes throughout Isle of Dogs that are not suitable for children. The movie deals several times with suicide. I know that's a big deal in Japan, but it's a very serious tragic topic that needs to be delicately addressed. There are numerous depictions and discussions of graphic animal abuse to dogs. Early on we're shown a dog skeleton and led to believe that the boy just discovered his dead dog. There is also graphic violence, and a bloody surgery scene. The plot is really a massive mess of political/corporate conspiracies that overshadow the simple search for a lost dog. And we have to discuss the bilingual dialogue. Much of the movie is in Japanese. Only part of the Japanese dialogue has subtitles. Are you kidding?! This is an American movie released in America. It must be in English or have English subtitles. But even the English dialogue is lame, overcooking the Wes Anderson style. The visual style makes it hard to take anything very seriously, despite the heavy subject matter. But there is little else to lighten the mood. And without any likable or memorable characters, it's hard to stay engaged to the end. My advice is don't bother starting the trip to the Isle of Dogs.",

That is where this movie is at it's best because you have an amazing cast, who worked great together, and you have a lot of touching, heartfelt moments during that short amount of time. Rather than deal with these stupid subplots featuring rather awful human characters, Wes should have focused more on the dogs because they're the best characters in the film.And I do agree with a few other reviews on here as well: This movie is quite boring at times and it can nearly put you or actually put you to sleep.",

It's also a\"Isle of Dogs\" is another artistically successful Wes Anderson production. It's a bit darker and more dramatic than I expected, but no less entertaining, and it's got standout moments of beauty and charm that will stick with me. It's also a fantastic showcase for the stunning medium of stop-motion animation.Bryan Cranston nails the key vocal performance as Chief, the stray dog who sticks out of the pack of alphas that hold sway over Trash Island. The other dogs have highlights and flesh out the world, but Cranston, who is at war with himself, is radiant, and almost singlehandedly sells the whole picture. Even though the premise of \"Isle of Dogs\" is so absurd, the story is rich in character moments and symbolism, and is structured like an epic. The point-of-view is more often than not from the dogs' eyes and ears, with much of the Japanese being untranslated, an interesting artistic choice that may come off as inspired to some and cloying to others, especially since the human element plays a rather large part in the plot.While Anderson has plenty of fun here with dog jokes and puns, he also manages to devote time to examining the age-old give-take relationship between humans and dogs, social and environmental issues, the increasing detritus and forgotten sins of the modern age (the price we pay for \"progress\"), the influence of media and the elite, and the pursuit of the higher self, all in the span of an hour and forty minutes.As Anderson yanks on heartstrings with close-ups of tear-filled human and dog eyes and emotionally rich scenes of great inter-species bonding and tribulation, he also pays homage to the old Japanese masters - Kurosawa, Mizoguchi, and Ozu are all referenced with gorgeous mise-en-scene, character and set design, story choices, and complex framing and tracking shots.Pay no heed to the \"professional\" critics crying \"cultural appropriation\". They are going out of their way to find fault here. I see nothing offensive in this intricate portrayal of a fictional, alternate-universe Japanese city in all of its beauty and complexity. This is a story that transcends cultural and linguistic boundaries and appeals to all dog lovers, even as it slyly comments on the elaborate fictions that we humans love to craft and live by. I'm really not sure how it will play to kids, though.Although \"Isle of Dogs\" wasn't the manic comedy I was expecting, and there are definitely pacing issues and missed opportunities, it really spoke to me in a way few films do these days, and in a manner and style that closely evokes Japanese cinema from the bygone eras of the 50s and 60s as much as it does the rest of Anderson's often-stellar oeuvre. I'm definitely seeing this one again.",

Surprising coming from Wes Anderson, but Isle of Dogs is a tribute to dogs! They are cute and loyal and possibly sounds like Jeff Goldblum if you are lucky!The stop-motion is beautiful! The movement is fluent and very accurate to how dogs move, and the designs are stellar! It's beautifully shot too, a trademark of any Wes Anderson feature, and the world is unique and lively. In terms of scale and even the actual method of animation, is surpasses Anderson's first animated feature, Fantastic Mr. Fox by a mile. The voice acting is top notch, with a major standout going to Bryan Cranston as the main dog Chief. It's one of the best celebrity voice acting I have heard in a long time! It does have the effect similar to James Franco in the Disaster Artist where he is doing such a good job that everyone else looks a lot worse by comparrison, as many of talented voice cast do more of the Wes Anderson monotone, however for the world that they inhabit they do match perfectly. And the friendship between Chief and Atari is cute and quite touching, albeit brief.The main issue does come into the use of Japanese language. This does tie into the controversy of cultural appropriation. While it is true that the Japanese setting is mainly for aesthetic purpose rather than a deeper meaning, I wouldn't say it's that big of a deal in terms of the film's quality. However when it comes to the language barrier, it is a problem. Often they do have either characters narrating over as translation, which is fine like the case with Francis McDormand's character, other times the film have other characters English-speaking characters narrate for no real reason. I wished that Wes Anderson either just had subtitles, or just not had any and let the actions of the Japanese characters speak for themselves without having any translations, as some of the best scenes of the movie use the visual storytelling of animation speak for the non-English characters. Also Greta Gerwig's character in the film is rather pointless with her ark having a bigger narrative that the film suggests but never having a satisfying conclusion, unless it is meant to be a subtle commentary on the white savior trope.Overall another fantastic film from Wes Anderson! Here's hoping for more stop-motion efforts from him!",

Simply put, Anderson succeeds on both fronts.Setting the film abroad in Japan poses numerous language and translation issues that have to be addressed throughout the film, and Anderson nimbly uses it to his advantage.  Furthermore, each of the dogs is given a meaningful amount of depth and characterization.  That being said, there were a handful of times I felt my attention drifting throughout the movie, and I found myself less emotionally invested in the plight of the characters as the film went on.  In the end, Anderson has brought to us another prototypical Wes Anderson film, a unique combination of his particular form and function that we’ve come to know and enjoy, so while I certainly recommend seeing the film, I think it would really take being a dog lover to really love this movie.",

Plus, he still seems to be honing his craft and abilities. Isle of Dogs, in which all the dogs in a Japanese city in the near future are sent to a garbage dump island by a corrupt, dog-hating mayor when a disease breaks out, is his most impressive movie to date.Wes Anderson's films have always been visually arresting, but this one manages to beat all the others. The stop-motion format allows Anderson to control every angle, every visual in this detailed, fascinating-looking world that unfolds like a storybook come to life. Yeah, the human characters aren't the most polished-looking of stop-motion characters, but the dogss movement, including the wind in their hair, is really fluid. The story contains Anderson's traditional quirky, deadpan wittiness at full blast. The story is pretty inventive, there are even robot dogs!, while ultimately telling a heartwarming tale about loyalty to man's best friend. The ending is a bit rushed and resolved a little too easily if you ask me, though.Now if you don't like Wes Anderson in general than this won't be the film to change your mind. (He really doubles down on his style here.) But if you like something different from the usual film, than this is for you.",

The same goes for all the sets wich are pretty great.The cast of voices is of first level with quite a few of the director's well-known allies and although I don't usually mention this kind of stuff I must say the ridiculous criticism of the way in which Wes Anderson let the Asian characters speak only through something or someone translating them is just that; ridiculous. It's evident that this was the narrative approach that he decided to give to the story and it works very well.Stop seeing racism everywhere. When everybody starts to feel victimized that's when people begin to forget the real victims.But in a final note I must say that I highly recommend it and I will undoubtedly run to acquire it as soon as it is for sale.",

I feel that as much as the cure into it was plenty, it was mismanaged.I mean let's start with the talking dogs: the movie says that the movie is focused on the dogs dialogue first, with the humans mostly talking Japanese (mostly, because some don't, for some reason), and the reason I guess was to help us relate more with the dogs rather than the humans, to let us see the PoV of the dogs....but then there's a LOT of scenes with humans talking, introducing us characters we don't know (and most likely never will), and makes the whole dog talk a weird inconsistency. I think they should've made dogs silent instead, communicate with whines and barks instead, or perhaps have subs on THEM rather than the humans, or if you're going to put a foreign speech to make us \"separate\" from them, well, make their presence actually NOT matter! Secondly, the story is too messy to understand: there's this boy, called Atari, who wants to find his dog who was sent to this trash island. Why was it send to trash island? Because of a disease called dog flu that attacks all dogs. Why were they sent to the island? Because the bad guy hates dog and doesn't want to heal them. This is pretty much the plot btw and there's really not much else to say: the bad guy is there, he wants to look menacing, but there's really little of him, and the other protagonist, a girl which I don't even remember the name, wants to crusade against dog hate and is the ONLY other character that doesn't speak Japanese (alongside the interpreter...which again makes no sense! Are we supposed to be seeing the dogs PoV or not?!). I guess that, unsurprisingly, the best characters are the dogs but that's only because we get to see them more. And yet it feels lacking: the main 5 dogs are pretty bland and only the black dog gets any sort of character development, then you meet the other faction, outcasts or something, who were potentially great characters on their own, which I won't spoil but they could've made an entire movie on them ALONE!. But they appear only at the end, we barely even see them, except one or two, and then they disappear.I just don't understand what this movie was trying to do: the movie is kind of depressing but not in a good way, it just wants to be dark for the sake of dark, and the message it gives is quite mean and pretty cruel (although I'm sure that's not their intention). I assume there's a political message here but I guess I never understood it because when the movie ended I was just questioning \"what did I just watch exactly?\". I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it either. I was hoping it was a good adventure movie about finding one's dog, with SOME human interactions and human side story. Instead if tried too much of both, but not enough in my opinion.I guess take a look but I'm not sure really. I'll probably forget it in a few days.",

The stop-motion animation only added to my enjoyment, giving the movie a hands-on and loving feel which demonstrates the amount of work, effort and time that was put into the film. The story was a fun and compelling narrative, and, despite being moderately similar to other works of Wes Anderson, I still thoroughly enjoyed the film. Even though the animation was a little bit stilted, as was the dialogue, I felt it had a charm to it and fit the style of the movie. The only voice actor that I felt could have done a better job was Scarlett Johansson, although I feel part of this was the somewhat diminutive manner in which women, and especially her character, were written into the film. Additionally, there were several moments wherein I felt not as if I were watching animated dogs but watching people voice animated dogs, something especially notable with Jeff Goldblum's performance. Despite this minor qualm, I still felt pleasantly satisfied with the voice acting in the movie, especially the ferocious delivery by the Japanese leader. The story is, as a whole very endearing and charming, with tones of redemption being very present. Note, this movie is not entirely a kid's movie, so one shouldn't approach it with solely such a mindset. Although it is PG in Canada and the UK, it is rated PG-13 in the states, which I feel adequately represents the film's nature. Wes Anderson's signature style is one of my favourites, with its wide, symmetrical shots, and its beautiful set pieces. These are things that aren't lost in this stop-motion film. I would recommend this film to anyone seeking either a fun theatre experience, a good art film, or a cute story about a boy trying to find his genetically-enhanced super bodyguard-dog.",

Regardless of being a stop motion ‘fairytale’ (?) there’s enough gritty realism and unexpected themes explored to make this quite compelling indeed! Others, I feel have looked too deeply into the political and racial aspects of the, at times, rather emotional situations covered by writer/producer/director Wes Anderson (even though there are certainly many astute observations to be considered). Alexandre Desplat’s excellent and highly inventive music score adds much mood and movement to overall proceedings. While I expect, “Isle of “Dogs” won’t be everyone’s choice of entertainment it will please and intrigue more than it may alienate. I had not read anything about this movie before watching and was convinced it was a Japanese production – only to be surprised at the finish to find it was mostly American.  Highly recommended for a somewhat sardonic, dark and insightful journey into imagination and would expect it should garnish some attention at this year’s Global Awards. The visuals by British cinematographer Tristan Oliver are standout.While not many may remember a British animated film by Richard Williams from  ‘58 titled: “The Little Island” much of the humorous visual style of “Dogs” bears a resemblance and makes this rare featurette worth seeking out – simultaneously very funny and serious.",

The movie captivated me with its interesting story and beautiful set pieces. The animation in this movie is absolutely beautiful. I love the quiet scenes where they're all walking through beautiful environments, and the characters are black silhouettes. I'm also a big fan of the story, contrary to some other people. I love how this takes place in China and all the dogs are segregated to some remote island because of the disease their spreading. One thing I don't really understand and they might of explained in the movie is why Kobayashi or Major Domo hate dogs so much and want to kill them all. I guess its because there was a war between dog and cat dynasties at the beginning, but anyway i digress. Anyway, one other thing that I love about this movie so much is the colonization of the trash island the dogs were sent to and how they live. There is this one scene in the movie that i love and appreciate so much. Its when the owl comes to Spots and his tribe because he is the \"messenger\" of the island and the entire tribe gathers around the owl, and Spots says to the other dog, \"get this owl some sewer water\". As if these dogs are a real tribe giving a piece offering to this wise owl for sharing his information. There is a lot of good memorable scenes in this movie too. Again I like the quiet scenes where they are walking around these deserted beautiful set pieces. There is this where they are all building a boat which looks beautiful. A scene at the beginning where the dogs are fighting over a bag of garbage which is a great scene. I like how the 5 main dogs have to take a vote before they do something. The comedy in this film is alright, nothing that i laughed out loud at, but gave a little \"heh\" to. The humor is very visual comedy based, but there still is some witty dialogue in there as well. I want to talk about the animation again because it is so good! Wes Anderson and his team built figurines and small set pieces for them, and moved the figurines around frame by frame. You can really tell the amount of detail that went into the animation. I like when there is a fight in this movie, there is just a big cloud around the fight like an old cartoon, or how when a character is angry smoke will come out of there nose. Its those small details that really make me appreciate the animation. A flaw I have with this movie, is how some of the characters are just complete **** and not interesting at all. Like the stupid blonde afro girl who looks like she has smallpox, every scene she's in i just want to skip because she is just a boring, uninteresting character who tries to expose Kobayashi for the corrupt leader he is and what he's done, but she really just does nothing. She's just there as a sort of love interest for Atari. Speaking of love interest Scarlett Johansson's character is just another boring love interest for a main character and really adds nothing to the movie. Another character i'm not a fan of is Atari himself. He has a lot to do in this movie and has huge weight in the story. But he doesn't really do anything and just kinda speaks chinese the whole time, he's just not a very interesting character to me. All and all this is a good movie with a lot to like about, but I don't think this is Wes Anderson's best movie. It has beautiful animation, some interesting characters, and a compelling story. Honestly though I think anyone should see this movie just for the animation and beautiful visuals. 8/10 ****",

The movie's unique plot, combined with it's (sometimes dark) humor succeeded in keeping me engaged and entertained. One important thing to note about the movie is that Wes Anderson decided not to add subtitles to the characters who spoke Japanese. I think that this was because he wanted the audience to think. Wes Anderson wanted the audience to have their own interpretation of the film. Another reason may be that he possibly wanted the audience to feel like dogs, they can't understand human speech. This puts the viewer in the dog's shoes, and can help understand why despite the communication barrier, dogs are still considered man's best friend.",

The humans can’t understand the dogs as much as the dogs can’t humans, and with the hope that a Japanese person doesn’t watch the film, Wes Anderson planned to give the viewer the same feeling.",

And, of course, Isle of Dogs, as any Wes Anderson movie, has what distinguishes it from any other Wes Anderson movie. In fact, there are three new pluses here. First, and foremost, the visually storytelling. Yes, I know it's not a new thing to say about a Wes Anderson movie, but there is no Wes Anderson movie, nor any stop-motion animated movie that has used its visuals to tell its story in this way. Specially, when you know that this movie has many scenes where there is no dialogue in English, just in Japanese, or where there are just Japanese subtitles!The second great thing about Isle of Dogs is the voice cast. Sorry Fantastic Mr. Fox, I love you even more, but here the cast really adds up to the movie. The cast isn't star-studded just because it's a Wes Anderson movie, but every single actor, or actress, really made every character feels distinctive. Bryan Cranston, who voices Chief, is easily the best. His vocal performance here is undeniably one of the best in any animated movie from the last, say, five years. But really all the cast shines in this movie. Edward Norton is my second favorite.At last but not least, comes the music score from the Oscar winner, Alexandre Desplat. It has some Western touch in it, along with a traditional Japanese music. What a wonderful soundtrack! It really sticks in my mind long after watching the movie!.As I mentioned above, I prefer Fantastic Mr. Fox to Isle of Dogs. That's because Isle of Dogs, unlike any other Wes Anderson movie, is convoluted for its own good. That didn't hurt the movie as whole, except at the third act, which is quite rushed and messy. Also, I wanted the character of Atari to feel more life-like person. Because I felt he was overshadowed by the dogs. Nevertheless, Atari is a well-developed character.Isle of Dogs may didn't live up to my expectations, but still it is my favorite animated movie of 2018 so far!(8/10)",

However, I knew this was going to get some attention because of the animation which is reminiscent of Nightmare before Christmas, Fantastic Mr Fox, Wallace and Gromit and kubo. Little did I know how truly unique and abstractly beautiful this film was. For a film shot like this, it is remarkable the amount of movement in each scene. The unnatural angles, the sharp movements of the characters contrasted by gentle movements caused by soft winds, the comedic blocks of clouds and dust, all contribute to a fantastic charm which is not too distant from that often achieved in short films. There wasn't a wide variety of emotions experienced while watching this film, which is obviously the desired goal of a dystopian world. There is no real sense of dread and no real feeling of reluctant sadness of which clutters animated films, instead you watch every scene transfixed by the style, following the wandering characters and their minds.It really is a film to sit back and relax while watching. The smooth voices of the actors absorb you into the world and characters. There is no reliance on typical Hollywood tricks that is so formulaic at this point where music or poorly written dialogue is the only thing telling the audience what they should be thinking or feeling. Instead, in this film not all the dialogue is translated and whilst the soundtrack is beautiful it is not used to replace anything but it is used to compliment the story. Therefore, the audience feels engaged, they begin to think for themselves and makes you leave feeling you have experienced a truly authentic and unique film. My only real criticism is the childish minor plot detail of the whole cat versus dogs element that didn't feature heavily in the film, thankfully, but the fact it featured at all with little significance made that detail seem unnecessary and a bit predictable. Other than that this a really stylish mature film that can be both thoroughly enjoyed by both critic and audience, both old and young.",

I mostly give tons of extra points to stop motion films because, even if they are not good films in everything else besides the animation, I know what a pain in the a** making stop motion is. Not saying that 2D and 3D are easier (honestly any animation form has its level of difficulty) but stop motion requires a lot of extra work (Building the sets, the characters and all that). In that aspect, Isle of Dogs is great. I loved the visuals. I love the insane amount of detail in basically every single shot. It's really unbelievable. Not only the animation, but the style and the use of colors in general. The composition of each shot is also pretty good. Regardless of what you think about Wes Anderson, you have to admit that he knows what he is doing. I like the character design, specially the dogs. It's kinda refreshing to see a movie about dogs in which the dogs look...\"Ugly\". By that, I mean that the movie doesn't want you to care or to connect with the characters just because they are cute like most animated movies with animals as protagonists. Because they are not cute (They really aren't, they look terryfing but in a good way) the movie does a great job in making you like them in a different way: The writing.Now, I have mixed feelings about the writing. I thought that there were a lot of writing choices I just didn't agree with, specially plot points and character resolutions that I thought could've been written better. Also, most of the characters were very underdeveloped. I think that only Chief and Atari were the only characters that actually had a character. They were really well developed and fairly well written. The scenes between those two characters might be some of my favorite of the movie. There were other characters that I honestly think could've been completely removed, like the \"love interest\" of Chief. Many of the characters were one note and leave the movie halfway through. This is why I say that only Chief and Atari are the only actual characters because those are the ones that get the most screentime and actual relevance to the plot. Most of the acting was really bland. Maybe that was the direction that Wes Anderson gave them, but I honestly didn't like most of the acting. Most of the characters sound almost exactly the same. The only performance I liked was Brian Cranston's (who played Chief).I appreciated details in the movie as a whole, like when characters are speaking in japanese and there are no subtitles and the only way we get to know what they are saying is by an in-movie translator character or by an actual subtitle but when it's an important line. That was pretty cool, because, honestly I feel that many of the things the Japanese characters said were irrelevant. I feel like the \"gimmick\" of putting japanese text on the screen and underneath that text the english translation in a small font was cool at first but then starting to be overused to the point of feeling like the movie was doing it \"just because it looks cool\". Another issue I have, which is more of a nitpick is the fact that dogs speak in english. Why do they speak english? Do humans understand them? Do they actually talk or maybe it's just a metaphorical way of representing their thoughts? I don't know. But those are just nitpicks, like, the movie is not ruined because of that or anything. But what really stops this movie from being a flawless movie (which I think it could've been) is the writing and how some plot points are executed. This is still a great movie and while it's sadly not a masterpiece, it's really worth watching.",

Basiclly, the plot is a young pilot named Atari trying to find his dog on trash island. The stop-motion is great, the movie is touching for example: When Chief finds out Spots is his brother, or when Atari gives the guard dog treatment to Chief. It's Just great.100/100",
