  "critic_reviews": [
    "Not only is Fallout the best Mission: Impossible film by a considerable margin, it is also undoubtedly the best action film of the year.",
    "Cruise and McQuarrie have made the best film in the franchise’s history and the most enjoyable and exciting action movie in several years.",
    "It’s got that finely-tuned, perfect blend of every technical element that it takes to make a great action film, all in service of a fantastic script and anchored by great action performances to not just work within the genre but to transcend it. This is one of the best movies of the year.",
    "Unlike many of his action-cinema contemporaries, McQuarrie excels at creating clear lines of sight for his set pieces, and cutting them together to ensure maximum tension.",
    "Writer and director Christopher McQuarrie borrows just the right amount of familiar spy tropes in his second “M:I” outing, and his film, while intelligent and witty, never becomes too self-serious or chatty. It’s the best night out at the movies so far this summer.",
    "McQuarrie also builds on the last film’s self-aware level of wit and, most importantly, its set-piece-crafting sophistication. No action sequence is allowed to peter out, or be chopped to ribbons in the edit, or lean on the crutch of CG augmentation.",
    "A combination of thrilling stunts, insane daring and clever writing make this a stunning piece of action cinema. Just be sure to take your heart meds first, and hold on tight.",
    "McQuarrie brings grace and grit, and Cruise brings it, period. This quick-witted, fleet-footed franchise shows no sign of flagging.",
    "He’s only Tom Cruise because nobody else is willing to be — or maybe he’s only Tom Cruise so that nobody else has to be. Either way, Fallout is the film he’s always promised us, and it was totally worth the wait.",
    "OK, McQuarrie may not have De Palma’s sweat-drop precision, John Woo’s craziness or the impish wit of Brad Bird, but his mastery of logistics here is easily sufficient to make it the blockbuster of the summer.",
    "Simply put, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is the best action movie you will see this year. You’ll probably leave the theater overcome with an urge to go jumping from building to building.",
    "It’s the kind of pure, straight-no-chaser pop fun that not only keeps taking your breath away over and over again, it restores your occasionally shaky faith in summer blockbusters.",
    "Mission Impossible: Fallout is not a triumph of literal realism, orderly plotting, or restraint, but it’s proof that thoughtful execution, comedic timing, and a true moral center count for much more.",
    "Moving like the lit fuse that blazes brilliantly across the opening credits of both the original Mission: Impossible television series and its first big-screen adaptation, Fallout turns out to be a breathlessly exciting action spectacular: the blockbuster spy thriller as sustained endorphin rush.",
    "Mission: Impossible - Fallout merges the franchise’s big-budget spectacle with an utterly ferocious style of action filmmaking that far surpasses what McQuarrie executed in either Rogue Nation or Jack Reacher.",
    "McQuarrie has proven himself such a keen purveyor of large-scale cinema that not only solidifies Fallout as a benchmark for the franchise, but a bona fide manifesto for breathtaking, high-stakes action–a mission that the genre as a whole would do well to accept.",
    "To be fair, you can scoff at the antics and still be swept away. The final quarter of Mission: Impossible—Fallout takes place in Kashmir, with a helicopter chase through deep gullies and past snowy peaks. McQuarrie keeps the action crisp and clear, to match the icy air.",
    "This episode is something special, because the dance is so smashingly gorgeous.",
    "There’s a whole lot of everything in the Mission: Impossible — Fallout, an entertainment machine par excellence that skitters around the world and has something to do with nuclear bombs, mysterious threats and dangerous beauties. Mostly, it has to do with that hyper-human Tom Cruise, who runs, drives, dives, shoots, flies, falls and repeatedly teeters on the edge of disaster, clinging to one after another cliffhanger.",
    "As these films have gone on, they’ve become more and more fascinated with Hunt’s essential ludicrousness. Mission: Impossible – Fallout decrees him elemental—a crucial, indefinable component keeping the very fabric of humanity knitted together. The film is so dizzyingly fun that, at least while you’re watching, it seems like a sound conclusion.",
    "It’s not just “Impossible,” it’s irresistible.",
    "A cinematic centrifuge of acrobatic stunt work, breakneck chases and immersive action, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is a perfectly calibrated piece of filmmaking that plays the viewer like a drum right from the start.",
    "McQuarrie clearly believes in creating coherent set pieces: His combat scenes are tense, muscular, and clean, shot and edited in such a way that the spatial geography makes sense. He places audiences just over Cruise’s shoulder, or staring into the actor’s face as he grimaces with exertion.",
    "The sixth film in the series is among the most outstanding, delivering a near-exhausting amount of stupendous action sequences paired with deft character drama and the requisite life-or-death stakes. Fallout is a testament to writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, who gives the proceedings a witty, sophisticated grandeur, and yet the film belongs to Cruise and his seemingly limitless passion for putting himself and his audience through the wringer.",
    "In ragged times, the sophisticated derring-do of Fallout is a welcome gift, a slick and studio-polished adventure that nonetheless has the undermining wink of transgression. The movie’s nerve and moxie successfully make us forget its corporate overlords, and all those other oligarchs grinding millions of American lives into nothing.",
    "Even as the narrative becomes more perplexing — as before, realistic masks conceal true identities, characters' actual agendas remain hidden — the fast-moving spectacle unfolds in extraordinary fashion.",
    "After two decades, Fallout might be the finest film in the series. (To me, it’s a toss-up between this and Ghost Protocol.) Either way, Mission: Impossible is clearly the best ongoing action franchise in the world. And nothing else even comes close.",
    "“Fallout” just might be the best of the franchise, and what a rare thing that is for a long-running series.",
    "Mission: Impossible — Fallout is definitely everything we expected, and more. You might need to go lie down afterward, in a good way.",
    "Mission: Impossible — Fallout, is everything a summer action pic should be — a delirious procession of stunning stunts, epic brawls, state-of-the-art car chases and ticking clock countdowns.",
    "Some of it’s pleasingly old school in its reliance on formidable stunt work. Enough of it, though, gets a digital effects assist for the amazements to scale the heights of plausibility and then leap, like a gazelle, to the adjacent mountain of sublime ridiculousness.",
    "McQuarrie’s sense of building a scene on the barest of elements, communicating the most empirical of information, is so breathlessly impeccable, the plot barely seems to matter aside from creating easily understood stakes and giving Ethan Hunt a reason to keep, in the parlance of the film, figuring it out.",
    "Fallout is the boldest of a series that has set a very high (sometimes literally so) standard for breathtaking set-pieces. By my count, the new film has at least seven of them—a generous gift to summer audiences from daredevil star Cruise, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood.",
    "Mission: Impossible knows exactly what it needs to be: a fun and chummy thrill ride that’s always self-aware. Fallout follows that agenda, while also revisiting its more severe roots. It’s a sequel in every sense of the word, reintroducing not only familiar faces, but styles, themes, and motifs of past films.",
    "Genre convention means it’s a foregone conclusion that this mission is not, in fact, “impossible”, but director Christopher McQuarrie cleverly controls the ticking clock quality that makes these films so much fun.",
    "Mission: Impossible—Fallout may be the best Mission: Impossible movie since the first, made in the dawn of the cat-Internet age, 1996, by Brian De Palma. Or perhaps it’s just the one with the mostest: even by the franchise’s extravagant standards, Fallout throws off Hope-diamond levels of grandeur.",
    "Whether it’s the next in a long line or a summation of a fun series, Mission: Impossible — Fallout is a movie that all but defines escapism at its finest.",
    "His sixth Mission: Impossible movie, Mission: Impossible — Fallout, isn’t the best of the bunch (that would be number four, Brad Bird’s Ghost Protocol), but it’s easily the second-best and certainly the Cruise-iest, meaning it’s nearly as entertaining as it is strenuous. Which is a mighty high bar!",
    "In addition to the absurd stunts and convoluted plot machinations, what makes the Mission: Impossible movies work in general, and Fallout in particular, is that they let their characters be characters, driven by a number of complex factors, even when they’re chasing an enemy or trying to get out of a scrape.",
    "The practical effects, meaning the real stuff the computer never touched, make all the difference when you’re asking audiences to see the characters as human instead pawns in a digital game.",
    "This is a film that wants you to live in the moment, to enjoy what is on screen when it is there in front of you and not worry how it fits into a plot that can be confusing but clears up in time for the inevitably rousing conclusion.",
    "Mission Impossible: Fallout is a worthy addition to the franchise and a fast pace thrill-ride.  McQuarrie manages to keep the story, stunts, and structure fresh.",
    "At nearly two and a half hours, it’s designed to test your patience for the things that matter in these movies — violent confrontation, deception, jokey camaraderie, and over-the-top action — but it does so with a remarkably re-engaged fluidity of purpose.",
    "A relentlessly entertaining exercise in putting Cruise’s Ethan Hunt through his paces again. And again. And again. But hey, there’s much pleasure in watching him continually fall off things.",
    "Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a fun but very familiar entry in the long-running franchise.",
    "As summer franchise movies go, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is near the top of the heap.",
    "Given all the on-screen risk-taking, Mission: Impossible - Fallout plays it pretty safe. What you get is essentially an action movies greatest hits package.",
    "The result is a film that won’t make a dent in cinema history but, with an ebullient gusto, it is impossible to resist.",
    "Although perhaps a little too long and not as tightly plotted as Rogue Nation, Fallout offers everything a viewer could reasonably expect from a Mission: Impossible production. It’s reliable.",
    "Not just one of the best but, at its best, an exercise in pure action-movie propulsion and an essay in how to get from Point A to Point B in the most ingenious and exhausting way imaginable.",
    "Much ink has been spent analyzing this enduring phenomenon called Tom Cruise, and what motivates him, onscreen and off. “I just want to entertain people,” he said recently. That’s one mission he can still nail.",
    "[Cruise] makes the movie fun to watch with his age-defying eagerness and death-defying stunts that bring a reasonably human scale back to blockbuster action, benumbed of late by the low-stakes digital fakery of special-effects movies.",
    "While the movie on the whole isn’t quite the caliber of the last two missions (“Ghost Protocol” and “Rogue Nation”), director Christopher McQuarrie’s action-packed “Fallout” set pieces are outstanding, finding great character moments in the middle of the explosiveness",
    "While some are hailing Mission: Impossible — Fallout as something truly special, I wouldn’t go quite that far. It does, however, offer as many thrilling dance numbers—I mean, action sequences—as any of the other installments.",
    "Even its most irritating parts don’t fatally damage a whole that works amazingly well, despite its own excesses.",
    "There’s a delirious joy in watching this much action, this well executed at every level.",
    "For a massive summer tentpole, Fallout’s pleasures are gratifyingly straightforward, direct without being dumbed-down. It’s a meat-and-potatoes banquet, one that doesn’t need to be interesting to be satisfying.",
    "Mission: Impossible - Fallout is cocked, locked and ready to blow you away with more than just Henry Cavill's forearms.",
    "Over two-and-a-half hours, you get a lot of deafening bangs for your buck, and the tourist location stunts are impressive - but there isn’t as much humour in the dialogue as before.",
    "As in Rogue Nation, Fallout‘s action scenes are cleanly composed and easy to follow, and so abundant as to become monotonous."

This is by far the best Mission Impossible film by a long shot. It really is amazing that the sixth film in the franchise is better than its predecessors combined and if this standard maintains then it’s a franchise that certainly isn’t going away any time soon. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is not only as good as you’ve heard, it’s better.Everyone’s back, director Christopher McQuarrie, Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson. Also featuring some new additions, Angela Bassett, Henry Cavill and the infamous moustache that ruined Justice League. The story is simple enough, stop terrorists getting nuclear weapons at all costs. But the story isn’t where it’s at, it’s not about the gadgets or even the ridiculous masks that I can’t seem to get over. No it’s all about the action and the stunts and wow does it deliver. Once the action starts it just keeps on coming, an intense thrill from start to finish. The action sequences are spectacular. If there’s one thing you can count on is the stunts get better every time. Not only are they well coordinated they’re clear to watch. You’re never sitting there wondering who’s hitting who, the nausea inducing shaky cam sending you over the edge (Yeah I’m looking at you Bourne 5) or watching a car chase in a comical stream of quickly edited shots leaving you not knowing what the hell is going on (hang your head in shame Quantum of Solace). Mission: Impossible – Fallout is action filmmaking done to perfection with an electrifying film score by Lorne Balfe that compliments every scene, I loved it.Some of you may know I’m not exactly the biggest Tom Cruise fan and that’s putting it mildly but damn he’s one hell of a stunt man. It’s not just the running, and the running. He’s doing everything from hanging on to the side of a helicopter to shattering his ankle while jumping from one building to another. The stunts and the film itself have exceeded expectations so believe me when I say under no circumstance should you miss this movie. Highly recommended and you know if I’m recommending a Tom Cruise movie then it has to be worth it.",

      "content": "The production of Tom Cruise’s sixth installment in this decades-old spy series was famously put on hold following a near disaster during the filming of a stunt in which Cruise’s Ethan Hunt attempts to leap from the top of one building acrossThe production of Tom Cruise’s sixth installment in this decades-old spy series was famously put on hold following a near disaster during the filming of a stunt in which Cruise’s Ethan Hunt attempts to leap from the top of one building across a chasm to the safety of another building. The failed stunt resulted in fractured ankles and 8 weeks of delayed production. The buildup, publicity and the motivation behind this stunt is a perfect analogy for Mission Impossible: Fallout. The minds behind this film set out to create a eye-catching, edge of your seat spectacle and succeed despite several near misses.The premise here is that Cruise’s Ethan Hunt and his Impossible Mission Force team of spies botch a nuclear arms deal and are tasked with retrieving the goods by any means necessary while under the watchful eye of the CIA with a thuggish Henry Cavill acting as babysitter long for the ride on the IMFs exploits. Along the way, the audience is treated to a series of amazing action set pieces including a death-defying skydiving sequence, shootouts, chase-sequences, and the aforementioned leap of faith. Along the way, Simon Pegg does an excellent job of providing the levity and the excellently relentless Rebecca Ferguson acts as foil to Cruise’s Hunt. If the casting sounds familiar, it should since many characters and plot points carry over from McQuarrie and Cruise’s previous collaboration (Rogue Nation), and it is ultimately to the film’s benefit as the casts dynamics work well and helps to flesh out this universe that the filmmaker seems to be building. There are laughs; there are thrills; but most importantly, there is motivation for all of these people to be on screen together which doesn’t feel forced or unnatural. However, despite everything this movie does well, there are a few hiccups along the way.To be fair, at a runtime of 2 hours 28 minutes, the movie does not drag or punish you for sitting through it.  The filmmaker at work here does a good job of pacing the action to allow the audience time to breathe and soak in the splendor before jumping into another intense scene.  In addition, the exposition (and there is a lot of it) feels natural as spies need to be briefed and debriefed on missions and does not give the audience many reasons to doze off during scenes that don’t contain running or shooting.  What does happen though is a case of over extension.  Fallout contains what seems like a natural, traditional first, second and third act; yet it decides to cram in a fourth act for the heck of it at the 2 hour mark.  It’s almost as if McQuarrie and Cruise wanted to begin the sequel to the film before the credits rolled.  And this is what’s unfair to viewers: subjecting them to the overindulgence of the filmmaker rather than giving them a movie going experience they are not soon to forget for the RIGHT reasons.  Besides this, the movie also seems to waste great actors at the expense of Cruise’s screen time. Simon Pegg, Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin all essentially provide cameos when their characters seem to warrant more.  And most egregiously, Henry Cavill’s brash, roguish super spy (a role he seems born to play) is unfairly pushed aside on several occasions.Despite a few missteps, and a challenging runtime, Fallout provides a spectacle that few other movies are able to accomplish these days. It awes, provides laughs, and constantly reminds its audience why some movies just have to be seen on the big screen. Similar to the aforementioned stunt mishap, Fallout has every intention of impressing its audience with the sheer size, danger and gall it takes to constantly raise the stakes in a genre that relies on tropes and familiar plots. But as the real-life story showed us, no matter how meticulous the planning that goes into such a risk, it does not guarantee a perfect shot. 3 out of 5 Stars",

'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' is filled with more great stunt work from its lead, Tom Cruise, solid direction from Christopher McQuarrie, and some fantastic work from its supporting cast including; Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) heads to Berlin to intercept three plutonium cores before the Apostles get there and sell them to John Lark. However, things turn around for the worst as Luther (Ving Rhames) is taken hostage, and Hunt chooses to save Luther's life leading the plutonium to be taken. Ethan is then sent to Paris, where he is joined alongside agent August Walker (Henry Cavill), where they try to take back the plutonium. When things still don't go according to plan, as they cannot find the right enemy, they're given more tasks to try and track down the culprit. What makes this movie exciting is both the stunt and camerawork. The action fills the movie with a sense of gravitas and you can feel every sense of danger, not just for the characters, but for the actors too. The hand-to-hand fight scenes are practical, brutal and intense. No CGI gimmicks, no flashy choreography, just plain and simple work by a group of actors. It feels raw and intense.

      "content": "Six movies in and the Mission: Impossible train continues to hit big with yet another high octane thrill ride that is entertaining and highly re-watchable. While it is commendable that the action scenes are done largely practical, what trulySix movies in and the Mission: Impossible train continues to hit big with yet another high octane thrill ride that is entertaining and highly re-watchable. While it is commendable that the action scenes are done largely practical, what truly does make them work is the understanding the directors have with knowing how to make great action scenes. The set pieces are fun, the choreography is great, and you are not questioning how any of this could happen in real life. They just do! It's a secret rhythm of tension and escapism that truly make this franchise one of the greats! However the thing that truly sets this movie back from being as amazing as the hype makes it out to be, at least for me, is the script. Now I am well aware that in terms of storytelling, the Mission: Impossible films are not all that great, and I am okay with that because I never felt like the previous films tried to be something that it's not, nor do the scripts detract from the overall enjoyment (the exception to that rule being the second film, obviously). However, the writing for this movie really does hamper a lot of the fun. For one, the dialogue can be really bad at times and often comes off as cheesy without any self-awareness for how cornball they truly are. Not to mention how many times the movie tries to be clever with it's multiple plot twists that just gets more obnoxious as the film goes on. Especially when it comes with the big reveal of who this mole agent is, which is so painfully obvious the movie never tried to hide it. There is even a scene which blatantly shows its cards to the audience. I won't spoil it but if you have seen it, you know what I am talking about. The acting is a bit hit or miss as well. While there are not truly amazing performances in this movie, for the most part the actors do a good job and are totally invested, with Tom Cruse, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, and Sean Harris doing solid work. However, the weakest link of the main cast is Henry Cavil. I do not mind him as an actor as so many people do that I know of, however here he is quite terrible. So much of his delivery is wooden and stiff, he does not look like he is having any fun at all with his role, and his accent is phony at best, as he sounds like he is doing an impression of Spottswoode from Team America. His mustache is pretty good, I must say. Angela Bassett and, surprisingly, Alec Baldwin are also pretty bad here too.Fallout is certainly overrated in parts, but it is still another great film in the franchise. Should they stop making them while they are ahead? Yeah probably. But regardless, I am still looking forward to where the series comes to next!",

When Fallout released I had only seen up to III, so I watched Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation in the days up to going to see Fallout. Ghost Protocol in particular is an excellent film, and Fallout is easily the best in the series to date. It's intense, well-paced, has a few quiet but very powerful moments, and has a well-rounded cast. The addition of Henry Cavill is an interesting one, especially considering what they do with his character. It benefits greatly from involving many returning characters, especially the villain and new female lead from Rogue Nation. The action scenes do not disappoint: brutal fistfights, car and motorcycle chases, and a climactic helicopter duel that had my moviegoing companion literally on the edge of their seat. I don't get to go out to many movies aside from Marvel ones and the occasional Disney movie. Fallout was a great summer blockbuster and well worth seeing in theaters.",

This Review will mostly consist of bias towards how IMAX is the best place to watch movies. BIAS! Because when you're at stakes,he has your back.And that will already tell you how Mission Impossible Fallout,the sixth (yes. SIXTH) entry of a franchise consistent of movies upgraded after the previous one,takes all the other Summer Movies (except Incredibles 2) and throws them at the Garbage Bin like nothing ever happened.Oh,and also it's the closest thing to the best of the franchise and,whatever…But going down to the point,yes. Of course it rocks. Maybe more than I expected.And hey,for a movie that made me jump off my seat,scream two times (I was at the IMAX showing,so the loudness made it for everything) and having the best use 3D since Avatar,it really did its job.Here we have a movie that may enter into the Staples of action movies that has an ingenious use of plot twists (with one that made me laugh,being in my mind “so that is what Jurassic World 2 tried to do!”), exhilarating and tension-filled action sequences (full of great usage of IMAX Cameras more than their previous effort) and a screenplay that feels like a school lesson that you need to listen carefully because it's gonna make it for the exams the next day.The story manages to give away a few nods and connections to previous MI Movies (especially Rogue Nation) which was really enjoyable to see as a fan of this franchise.Speaking of the story,it also manages to get intense sometimes,with one death sequence that was so creepy,it reminded me of how TJ Miller’s character died in Transformers 4. (Ugh). Not only that,but the way it starts to build up the tension in several scenes only to find out that “Wait! It was all a set-up for something”.And trust me when I say Vanessa Kirby’s presence as a secondary character was better than the 5 minutes of Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Stink 2. Oh,and thank God they gave Solomon Lane more stuff to do as a villain. He was threatening in Rogue Nation,believe me,but I kind of forgot his motivation in that movie…The Action Sequences are Adrenaline Fuel. The intense kind of Adrenaline Fuel,and that's where my IMAX Bias starts,so get ready. *Sings like the Animaniacs showing every nation*: Jumping the seats during every gunshot,looking away during the HALO Jump - covering my eyes while Tom Cruise hits a damn Helicopter! - The Paris motorcycle sequence almost peed my pants - And during the helicopter Sequences I screamed at the theater two times! *Stops singing*Seriously,though. When did you scream at an Action Movie (on an IMAX Theater) that has a thrilling Helicopter scene last time? Oh,and SEE IT IN IMAX 3D,DAMMIT!As much as everyone calls it a “Gimmick” these days,it helped out for a lot of Action going on,like during the HALO Jump,where Cruise almost jumped out of the screen,or the Helicopter Sequence.To continue the gold nuggets,Lorne Balfe (Composer of Pacific Rim Uprising and LEGO Batman) has finally made his signature score,with a reliance on 'The Plot Thickens’,yeah (just like Joe Kraemer last time),but he somehow manages to put new life into the theme,while accompanying it with a slew of exciting cues (and a Zimmer-esque theme that hearing on an IMAX felt like me being treated with infinite plates of 24-Carat Gold...Mmmm...Gold…).And….Wait. No CG? All Practical? Are you sure? That death sequence felt CG… Well what's the point nontheless,it was all great,so…And of course,aside the acting doing a great job,I could see a Tom Cruise in there determined and motivated to do all of this shenanigans that could've killed him in no time (*coff coff* The Ankle *coff coff*).Oh,wow…You know? For a movie like Mission Impossible Fallout,I didn't think of coming out of the theater like this,realized with multiple emotions at once. Usually,when I see a movie,I stay there like a normal person,but...WOW,this movie unlocked my emotions in no time,so I commend it for that too.A year ago,when Dunkirk had come out,I saw it in IMAX (of course) I felt the tension,and I grabbed myself for a couple of minutes, but I never thought a dumb fun Action Movie like Mission freaking Impossible would make me emotionally alive. Hell,Infinity War didn't do nothing for me on first viewing,aside the full “Immersion”.So yeah,Mission Impossible Fallout is the best movie of the bunch that with Christopher McQuarrie's intelligent direction,a coherent story and action sequences that make you feel like an idiot if you didn't see them on IMAX,manages to also be the best movie of the Summer,if not of 2018 so far.Oh,and SEE IT IN IMAX 3D.End of the IMAX Bias. This message will self-destruct in 5 Seconds.",

On rit également ailleurs mais là, ça me semble involontaire quand même... Ce MI aligne les scènes d'action avec la régularité d'un métronome, des scènes et des cascades tout-à-fait impossibles et encore plus impossibles qu'avant, car la surenchère est son crédo... et bien que le réalisateur soit le même que les 2 précédents, l'action reste ici la plupart du temps très lisible et incroyablement spectaculaire. Signalons par exemple (entre autres) cette poursuite de dingues dans notre capitale à nous, Paris la ville-lumière (avant que les gilets cons ne la carbonisent complètement... Tom, au secours !...). Ou le final avec des hélicoptères parce qu'il faut toujours des hélicoptères dans un MI, c'est une obligation contractuelle. Des Airbus, c'est bien ça.Je peux bien citer une marque puisqu'il faut citer toujours au moins deux marques pour éviter la publicité corrompue. Et la seconde, c'est BMW. Oui, tout le film est sponsorisé par BMW : voitures et motos incluses...Dommage, Jeremy Renner n'est plus dans l'équipe... Mais on a toujours le gros Rhames qui a encore abusé des stéroïdes, tellement d'ailleurs qu'il est vraiment devenu gros. Et le Simon Pegg toujours aussi imbécile. La jolie Rebecca, je ne dis pas non par contre, ni cette autre blonde sortie de son coquillage, Vanessa Kirby : je ne sais pas qui c'est en fait mais j'adhère.J'adhère aussi au choix de Superman en moustachu et je trouve qu'il tire les marrons du feu dans des rôles pas toujours très gentils... ça peut promettre pour le Sorceleur ma foi. Allez Henri, on y croit.Quant à Tom, le film tente de le rendre un peu moins con que son personnage résolument impossible... mais c'est impossible. On reste en tout cas happé par le gros triple A qui envoit tout ce qu'il a. Et il a des munitions, le con ! j'en ai oublié de finir mon pop-corn.",

The MI franchise has a remarkable talent for improving itself. There is one scene where you can automatically predict how it'll turn out. However, everything was so well edited I was tricked into feeling tense anyway.Director Christopher McQuarrie has an excellently deliberate sense of shots and pacing with both the suspense and fight scenes. The action scenes equally don't disappoint.For a nice change of pace, the movie focuses a little more on Ethan Hunt's mindset. He finds himself going undercover with dangerous people. There's a fair amount of tension and pathos to be mined from his facing the difficulty of trying to be a good man and completing his mission in a flawed, murky world.Now I wouldn't consider these deal-breakers, but there are a couple nitpicks. The film is a bit long. Some of the action scenes do go on and on. Also, it wouldn't have hurt if the plot was a bit more streamlined. The middle does feel a little sidequestey.",

Henry Cavill, Angela Bassett, and Vanessa Kirby also join the dynamic cast with filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie returning to the helm.I really loved Mission: Impossible - Fallout, I missed these breathtaking action scenes this year, but finally, I found what I've been looking for for very so long, and thanks goes to Mission: Impossible - Fallout.Everything in this movie was completely amazing, except for a small leak.. and it is the script... As I said it's not big, it's just a bothering sentence is repeating every plan..Let's get started with the only thing I didn't like about this movie, and as I said it's the script. Okay, why every thing they are about to do, or planned to do, or anything to do, they just have to say \"I'll figure it out\" or \"I'm working on it\"? What? Didn't you plan for anything for this movie or something?These two sentences bothered the hell out of me, actually! But it's nothing compared to everything that I loved in this movie.First of all, the action sequence, it's one of the best action movie of all the time! Every action scene I was like \"OMG, thank you for giving me a masterpiece in action, thank you!\". I think it's the best action movie in 2018 so far.Quickly quickly.. let's move to the performances... I loved them all! What an act-convincing?! I have no other comment about the acting, cause it was quite perfect!Oh, we're not done yet, we still have the fascinating storytelling! I don't want to spoil anything, but I need to say that don't believe what you're watching, cause they will surprise you like hell!!!!The story was good in every way that it could be, maybe at the beginning it didn't get my attention, but then it got my whole attention!Believe me, no one is overreacting when he says that this movie is a masterpiece, and if you don't believe us, go and see it yourself. It will not let you down, never ever!I actually wasn't excited to watch this movie, the trailer didn't get me at all, but it did actually give me what I want, it was way better than I expected it's gonna be!Oh, one more sadly thing I just remembered that I didn't like, the OST wasn't that good as it was so usual. But it wasn't so bad!I'm gonna give Mission: Impossible - Fallout an A, I think it's a magnificent movie, and definitely a worth-watching movie, I highly recommend watching this movie, guys.Okay, guys, thank you as always for reading my review, hope you like, and if you have any comment, please, say it to get improved.",

Easily the best action film of the summer and possibly the best since \"The Matrix\"As I have said before, Tom Cruise films are generally well-oiled machines. But this machine is a high-end sports car: thrilling and the handling is precise. Easily the best action film of the summer and possibly the best since \"The Matrix\" upped the action genre back in 1999.The action is relentless to the point where you say: \"this all seems a little unneccessary\". The trailers leading up to the July release have betrayed a fair amount of plot IMHO. But like a great omelette, it's not the individual ingredients but how they are ultimately cooked together that make it delicious.Not sure how much of this iteration of Ethan Hunt is Cruise or McQuarrie. The audience who have loyally followed this character over SIX editions of this franchise have likely seen the actor in his various other roles and films over that span. As youthful as he looks, Cruise seems to be letting the audience in on the fact that he is 56, heading for 60. The terrific bathroom fight scene with Cavill and Yang actually shows a man who has done probably thousands of takes of fight scenes, and frankly looks winded and flagging. There is a preceptible pattern of vulnerability emerging over the last few films, and it's actually pretty satisfying. It enriches his characters and doesn't lessen them.McQuarrie has emerged as a profoundly good action director. \"Rogue Nation\" was solid but it was really \"Jack Reacher\" where we got to see a director take somewhat thin material and elevate it to a much higher level.Finally, there is a curious retrospective quality to \"Fallout\" that seems to play on many of Cruise's earlier films. The end of the bathroom scene reminded me of \"Jerry Maguire\", busting into the funeral service with spinning disorientation echoed \"Eyes Wide Shut\", and the bare hand rock climb in the climactic confrontation reminded me of the opening sequence of \"MI:2\". Enigmatic in real life, there is no mistaking that this dude is an anomaly in the corporate Disneyland that is modern Hollywood: a classic movie star.",

By their own efforts, force-sensitive scavenging Jedis; vengeful ladies with psychokinetic skills and enhanced mental abilities or lethal combat prowess from ancient Chinese martial arts; drivers with good values ready for any racing madness involving high speed; young people experiencing memory or hearing problems thirsty for the adrenaline of a car, a motorbike, a yacht or a punch; supermen, superwomen, villains and anti-heroes who fight for stability defending their beliefs about peace, hope, justice, \"law\" and chaos staunchly; top-secret agents/spies wearing elegant attire that, most of the time, emerge victorious from their missions;  retired assassins who forcibly return to 'the Continental Hotel' by a puppy incident and characters and/or animated heroes who save continents, countries, cities, friends and families deserve their due respect and recognition both in the industry and in the history of film. However, suddenly, the sassy boldness and unstoppable charm of the IMF agent who leads, legally or illegally, impossible agency missions have helped to shape one of the best action/adventure films of the 21st century and, sans nul doute, the best actioner since George Miller's 2015 multi-Oscar-winning post-apocalyptic masterpiece. Hence, critics, cinephiles and moviegoers alike are greeting it with raves, comparing the latest and most barbaric adventure of Hunt and his team — save William Brandt played by Jeremy Renner, who was committed heart and soul to Marvel Studios — to modern-classic \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" for its mastery assembling and disassembling heart-stopping sequences and to the Christopher Nolan DC trilogy, especially with Warner's 2008 classic \"The Dark Knight,\" for its courage to deal with sore, meaningful purposes with a firm hand and mind-blowing ideas, piling layer after layer on the characters and the plot.An A-1 mainstream film must represent each feature of the script to the screen in the best way possible, however, an A-1 mainstream actioner must articulate smoothly the above with, of course, emblematic sequences. Every new movie in the 22-year franchise provides substantial added value coming in the form of legendary Tom Cruise, a true super-man who categorically rejects the use of stunt performers for his high-risk scenes. Modesty apart, Cruise is an actor who, literally and figuratively, gets under Ethan Hunt's skin, he's Hunt, thus becoming one of the few stars who perform their own action scenes today in Hollywood. This time, forget scratches and bruises, an on-set ankle injury has called him, an accident that halted the movie's shooting until his health improved. Drawing upon some landscapes and townscapes of India, UK, France and New Zealand, Rob Hardy, a modern cinematography maestro who has built artistic sci-fi gems such as \"Annihilation\" and \"Ex Machina,\" places his exquisite style in a setting far from fantasy, getting artfully neat visuals on its objectives with high levels of elegance, sobriety and magnetism on costume and production design, in the old-fashioned Parisian streets or the crushing European dreamscapes. Commitment by each and every one of the members of the huge technical and artistic team is awe-inspiring, they esteem a big budget, and, moreover, prioritize film's artistic purpose over the ever-lurking avidity for extravagant grosses.There are few cases where a commercial advertisement transcends beyond its purpose, here one of the best examples. The creators of the trailer released during Super Bowl LII must not only headline the year-end best trailers lists by critics and movie reviewers, but receive a true award for their exceptional, exceptional work. Although few talk about this kind of stuff in their reviews, the perfectly matched 2-minute stunner made by highly skilled trailer makers deserves it; one of the best trailers of this decade.\"Mission: Impossible-Fallout\" by Christopher McQuarrie smashes, on several occasions and ways, big-budget action movie tropes much like contemporary classics do, moving away from the artificiality of danger to get fully into building a true-blue adrenaline rush. In these times, making high-quality action films in Hollywood has become an impossible feat, putting the blame on plotting emptiness and tech breakthroughs that bury a good narrative. However, with an overlong period of time in between, mainstream gems serendipitily flourishes trying to propose through risks. That is what makes this \"MI\" entry to take part in the select, coveted must-see top of the last eighteen years. Film doesn't falsify reality, imitates it, for this reason, those breathtaking set-pieces are an out-of-this-world experience, where suspense and enjoyment are involuntary reactions to a cinematic cocktail everyone should see. A spectacular, unforgettable roller-coaster ride that vitalizes a billion-dolar spy franchise, a triumph that must be experienced in the largest IMAX screen.",

But i’m here to tell you this movie does not. I’m amazed how after 6 movies, this franchise still manages to make unique movies like this.Going to start talking about the action scenes. Completely amazing, purposefully, well thought out and well choreographed action sequences. This is what Fallout gives us, there was a scene, where Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and Walker (Henri Cavill) are fighting someone in a bathroom. The punches feel so real, the sequences was awesome, and brutal. The cinematography was amazing, more than what i was expecting from a Mission: Impossible movie. And that is because they use practical effects instead of CGI or green screen. That makes the experience as real as possible.Performances, were great from everyone. Not only Tom Cruise, with amazing acting and stunts, but the supporting cast did a great job. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames were incredible as always, Rabecca Ferguson also did a great job. And this has to be Henry Cavill’s best performance. He was great in the action scenes and his character felt intimidating like it should be.Talking about the story is where i have my first minor issue with this movie. It seems a bit recycled, and to make it completely original after 6 movies, is a bit of a stretch. The big twist is a bit obvious, you can really see it coming. But this doesn’t make the story less mesmerizing, the script was great and the director did a great work into moving the story along in such a way that every scene, every shot and every line of dialogue is extremely important, because it really is.The characters are great too. Ethan Hunt is incredibly charming, and the length he goes to not kill innocent people just makes him more of a compelling character. The villains where great, although i did want to see more from the main villain, as a character.This movie is gonna be in a lot of peoples top lists for 2018, i’m 100% sure it’s gonna be on my top movie list for 2018, and you don’t really want to miss, what i can safely say, is one of the best action movies i’ve ever watched.",

After a mission goes wrong, Ethan and his team needs to work against the clock and fight their way to the objective. Directed by Christopher McQuarrie.Mission: Impossible-Fallout is the longer movie in the franchise, i didn't felt that the story was that good, it still seems to be just an excuse for the action scenes to happen, but i gotta say that the story was at least very functional, it did had some nice twists. There is some coincidences and some motivations that aren't very clear, somethings really didn't make much sense. But generally, the narrative was very entertaining. The movie have different moments, it does have some emotional moments, and some solutions from old stories.Tom Cruise in this movie is one more time awesome, the big thing in his work is that he trully likes what he is doing, it challenges him, and that is totally noticiable and makes a completely difference for the audience, for me, personally, it makes way more easier to board in that journey with him, and his acting was on point as well. Rebecca Ferguson in this one had a little less time than in the last one, but still she is great, she indeed killed in this one, she is mysterious and badass, in this one she also had a little more sentimental part, and for me she sold it very well, so as the action scenes one more time that she was perfect. Henry Cavill do a good job, his physicality helped him a lot for this role, the action moments that he use his strenght worked out very well, in the acting he was also very functional, his character is kind of a not very expressive one, but he had a nice tone. Vanessa Kirby is also in this movie and she convinced me in what she did, she doesn't had much screen, but she was that obstinate and confident character, i bought it. Sean Harris does the same thing that he did in the last one, not very developed, but still, he did very well. Michelle Monaghan is back at the franchise, and she was affectionate, and i believed that she was the same character, was very good. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are both good, they are a comic relief and also very importants for the plot to go on. Alec Baldwin don't have much time, but he was good, mainly in the twist moment, he had a nice tone.The action scenes are once again outstanding, sincerely i can't think in much other movies that have better action moments than this one. This movie do some stuff that are really glorifying, so as the last ones also did, wich is mainly not use stunt doubles, not use cgi, no green scree, with everything being real it makes a completely diference, it let us feel better the environment, help us to be in the place. The directing in the action are great, the camera work very well, always following the actors during the scenes, the movie have a lot of giant moments, i have seen behind the scenes of all of them, becaus at first i wasn't believing that he really did all of that, and i was shocked, because some parts that i was sure that wasn't real, it was. Since the moment that they are in the plane in Paris it was great, the mise-en-scène let me be really comfortable there, and when they jumped, damn, that was fabulous, not just the filming that was genius, but the job that the actors did in the air was great, it was convincing and the sequence had some tension and sense of urgency because of the time. The previous movie had one of, if not, the best motorcycle sequences in movies history, in this one they pretty much reached the same level if not overcame that, the sequence in London here are insane, not just breathtaking but beautiful to watch as well, here the cameras also had a great job, following the characters in a way that is different, isn't like just walking side by side, but when the character fall, the camera have a dash, it was fantastic, the pursuing around the cars, that was just so great. The third insane action sequence, was in the helicopter, that Tom Cruise actually learned to fly a helicopter just for it to look more real here and also did all of the part around the helicopter he really did it, when i say that the actor is so badass as the character, i mean it, and the whole sequence there have a great footage, it is really well filmed, and also breathtaking, can make you sweat during it, the action here is just outstanding.The cinematography is very good, not just for the camera moviment and positioning that i already mentioned, but the colors are very pretty and alive, the movie takes place in different places and environments and it allows they to do a diversity that are so great as the second one, in this one have a snow parts that were really beautiful, not just that, but they use the place very well.",

Along the way, Ethan's true identity is brought into doubt and trust between the government factions involved fractures. The story of this film is by far the weakest part to me. And I don't say this because I think the story was bad, but because this story isn't anything we haven't seen in a Mission Impossible film before. Nuclear devices in play? U.S. Government treating Ethan as a potential hostile? This franchise has never done that before! It moves along in a way that doesn't make it seem repetitive to the point where it took me out of the film, but I just find it funny how the Mission Impossible franchise is able to recycle its storylines without really any backlash. I assume that is primarily because of the action, which I will get into in a second. Anyway, the story is serviceable and despite it getting a little trigger happy with the whole \"No, I betrayed you! No, I betrayed you before you betrayed me!\" concept I enjoyed it. Action: This is what I believe has helped this film rise above previous entries in the franchise and action films in general. The action sequences in this film are superb. The bathroom fight teased in the trailer? It lived up to the hype, as did pretty much every other fight in the film. There are also a few chase sequences that are better than the Bourne films, and that's saying something. In terms of a pure action film, this is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Acting/Characters: Everyone brings their A Game here. There is no weak link here. Tom Cruise once again proves that he apparently doesn't age and will probably play Ethan Hunt until he's 70, and Henry Cavill plays the CIA Agent who doesn't really trust Ethan very well. Screenplay: I don't think that there's any surprise here that Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects, Edge of Tomorrow, Rogue Nation) wrote a terrific script for this film. One weakness that often stands out with action films is weak dialogue, but not here. It's quite good all around. Cinematography: Camera work in this film was spot on, especially in the fast-moving action scenes. It didn't feel choppy and flowed like water down a stream. Overall: Given a deeper story, Fallout may have ended up one of my favorite if not my favorite film of the year so far.",

That being said, Tom Cruise looked fit as ever in the sixth installment, and proves once again that age is just a number. Sean Harris again plays the best villain the series has seen since Philip Seymour Hoffman, and to top it all of the willingness of Henry Cavill to play a roll in the shadow of one of action-movies-all-time-greats makes the film to what it is. For me personally, the presence of Alec Baldwin (delivering probably the best motivational speech in MI history) was a cherry on top, but that might just be personal. All in all an amazing cast, where Vanessa Kirby steals the show everytime she enters the frame. The film keeps you engaged every step of the way, and makes sure you go home with a rush that only cools down after a couple of hours. Here is to hoping this is going to be the Mission Impossible standard from now on.",

What started out as an auteur-driven James Bond has evolved into a consistent blockbuster factory. Starting with 2011's Ghost Protocol, Tom Cruise and his M:I filmmakers found a very satisfying formula for delivering summer thrills, and Fallout might be the best version yet. Don't expect anything revolutionary or new. That's not what this is about. What you will get is another up-tempo, dazzling rollercoaster full of beautiful people doing incredible things. You might poke holes in the plot or roll your eyes at some of the more predictable twists, but you'll still enjoy every minute of it. The craftsmanship is such that Chris McQuarrie and company managed to keep me on the edge of my seat during the climactic chase sequence even when I know damn well what the eventual outcome will be. They should keep making these for as long as Tom Cruise can still look good running.",

YES. Is it because of its story? No. Yes, Fallout has the one of the weaker stories in the franchise with predictable moments and similar story elements recycled from previous entries. But who goes to see a Mission: Impossible movie for its story? So besides the weaker story, let's dive head-first into what makes this movie exceptional. The action is the best it's ever been, with most of it being practical and on camera. The stunts of this movie will leave you exhausted and gasping for air. The last twenty minutes in particular are the most nail-biting out of the entire movie and franchise. EVERYONE gives a strong performance; with Henry Cavill being the biggest standout of the entire movie. He proves that he is more than just Superman or a pretty face; he's a great actor and proves that mustache-gate will only be a tiny blip in his career. Ving is great, Pegg is great, Ferguson is great, Bassett is great, Baldwin is great, Sean Harris is great, and Tom Cruise is... well, Tom Cruise. The Directing and writing from Christopher McQuarrie is tight and exceptional, same with the cinematography by Rob Hardy. In all, Fallout is the best one in the series simply by its strong cast, tight writing, perfect action, and direction by McQuarrie. If this is where the franchise ends, then it has ended on the highest of high notes and I am grateful for seeing it. I shall watch it, then watch it again, if not for the entertainment, then to learn from the people here, as they clearly know what they're doing.",
