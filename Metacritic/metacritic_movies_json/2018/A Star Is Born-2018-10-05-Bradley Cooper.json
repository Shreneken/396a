    "critic_reviews": [
        "In spite of a momentous directorial debut and performance from Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga leaves the lasting impression in A Star Is Born, a beautiful production perfectly suited to re-release the superstar as a top-tier performer; she is nothing short of astounding.",
        "Cooper knows he has an audience willing to listen, and what he says is so beautifully, powerfully open-hearted, vulnerable and loving it's overwhelming.",
        "It\u2019s such a welcome sensation to walk out of a movie feeling properly walloped, reminded of the potential power of the big screen to seduce us, entertain us, and break our hearts.",
        "One of the many wonderful surprises in A Star is Born is how director/co-writer/leading man Cooper strikes the perfect balance between a showbiz fable with emotional histrionics and performance numbers and a finely honed, intimate story with universal truths and experiences hardly unique to the entertainment world.",
        "The simplest thing to say about A Star Is Born is that it\u2019s all right. Not all right as in OK with a shrug, but thrillingly, almost miraculously right in all respects.",
        "Simultaneously an immersive concert film, enchanting romance and tear-jerking rock fantasy, A Star Is Born is a dynamic multifaceted showcase for Gaga and Cooper, who makes his directing debut a thing of melodic, masterful beauty. Together, they form an electrifying duo in one of the best movies of 2018 and the finest musical since 2002\u2019s \u201cChicago.\u201d",
        "For a movie with such big emotions, it also feels grounded and realistic. Somehow, Cooper has made a Hollywood fairy tale seem utterly believable and magical at the same time.",
        "Most thrilling are the stage sequences. Cooper often films Ally\u2019s thousands of screaming fans from her point of view \u2014 putting us in her lucky shoes for a minute...It\u2019s that feeling of exhilaration that makes A Star Is Born the best film of the year so far.",
        "The lightning in a bottle you have to catch to make an epic love story work is chemistry between the leads.  With one actor a relative novice, and the other trying to stretch himself and direct his first feature, the deck was stacked against them.  But wow did they pull it off. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper are terrific together.",
        "It rejoices in a classic structure in which one upward trajectory and one downward meet for a shining moment in the middle. Under Cooper\u2019s direction \u2013 and thanks to his chemistry with his co-star \u2013 the movie throbs with the excitement of that meeting, while the downfall of his alcoholic rocker achieves an almost tragic catharsis.",
        "A remarkably assured directorial debut from Bradley Cooper who turns in a career-defining performance opposite a promising Lady Gaga. A remake that captures the tone and spirit of prior films, A Star Is Born still blazes its own heartfelt, authentic path.",
        "Cooper has made a jaggedly tender love story that is never over-the-top, an operatic movie that dares to be quiet.",
        "The story of A Star Is Born may be as old as show-business, but it is also electrifyingly fresh \u2013 a well-known melody given vivid, searching new force.",
        "For one star to get an award, a handful of defeated nominees have to swallow their pain, as the spotlight moves away from them. For one star to deliver the shock of the new, another one has to receive the shock of the old. A Star Is Born turns that transaction into a love story.",
        "The songs, written by Gaga, Cooper, Lukas Nelson, Jason Aldean and Mark Ronson, are all terrific and will make a helluva soundtrack album, and Lady Gaga\u2019s performances are electrifying. Combine that with the genuine-feeling romance between the co-stars and the heartbreak of its dissolution, and you have one soaring and searing piece of movie entertainment.",
        "What Bradley Cooper has done here as an actor and director is truly remarkable.",
        "Cooper\u2019s A Star is Born is unquestionably a film born out of our current era and modern struggles with addiction. In that way, it serves as a potent reminder that even the most familiar stories can be used to examine the issues and concerns of a given moment.",
        "A refreshing take of this classic showbiz rise and fall tale, with updated character work, fantastic performances by Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga, and a soundtrack that will be stuck in your head for days.",
        "This latest and fourth version is a gorgeous heartbreaker (bring tissues). Like its finest antecedents, it wrings tears from its romance and thrills from a steadfast belief in old-fashioned, big-feeling cinema. That it\u2019s also a perverse fantasy about men, women, love and sacrifice makes it all the better.",
        "To fall in love with Bradley Cooper\u2019s A Star Is Born is to embrace its paradoxes and, to quote a song Lady Gaga sings in the film, go \u201coff the deep end\u201d and submerge oneself \u201cfar from the shallow.\u201d My advice? Submit. Suspend yourself in the charms and romance of this melodrama.",
        "You get pulled into a force field, thanks to Cooper\u2019s behind-the-camera chops and Gaga\u2019s sound and fury. By the time the end credits roll, you realize that, in fact, two stars have been born.",
        "Cooper\u2019s biggest innovation in this remake, which he wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, is his emphasis on partnership. He interweaves Jackson and Ally\u2019s relationship with the music they create together, so the audience\u2019s investment in both is palpable.",
        "The result is a show business rush so pure it would be illegal if it were a drug. Though the film\u2019s peek behind the celebrity-curtain love story inevitably falters a bit in the second half, the emotional waves it has already created manage to carry us over the rough spots.",
        "The result is pure Saturday-night moviegoing: it gives you one hell of a wallop, then you wake up on Sunday morning without a scratch. (By contrast, the emotional nakedness of the Judy Garland version, poised within formal compositions, can still reduce me to rubble.)",
        "Gorgeously shot, lighted and scored, and acted by both leads with an incandescence that feels fully lived in, Cooper\u2019s movie seduces you almost immediately. It doesn\u2019t promise the shock of the new, but from the first frame it casts a spell, the kind that lets you know immediately that you\u2019re in good hands.",
        "When it hits its highest, most resonant notes, Bradley Cooper\u2019s remake of A Star Is Born\u2014starring the director alongside pop icon Lady Gaga\u2014achieves a triumphant, romantic ache that is often just what we want to experience at the movies.",
        "It\u2019s wonderful to see a first-time filmmaker who\u2019s more interested in effective storytelling than in impressing us; telling a story effectively is hard enough. Best of all, Cooper has succeeded in making a terrific melodrama for the modern age.",
        "Cooper and Lady Gaga are dynamite together; this is a story that lives and dies by the central relationship and the instant chemistry that must blossom between them, and these two have it in spades.",
        "The latest update, directed by Cooper and built on the sturdy bones of William Wellman\u2019s and Robert Carson\u2019s 1937 script, has heart, soul, and sinew. Above all, it has Lady Gaga, both before and after her character\u2019s transformation from an outer-borough duckling into a superstar swan.",
        "A Star Is Born, is simply terrific \u2014 a big-scale cinematic delight that will have the masses singing, swooning and sobbing along with it.",
        "A well-seasoned, handsomely cured slab of showbiz schmaltz that hits all the right pleasure centers. With equal parts glitz and grit, Cooper has successfully navigated the most perilous shoals of making a classic narrative his own, managing to create one of its best iterations to date.",
        "This story has been told several times before\u2014and influenced other similar romances\u2014but Cooper and Gaga find a way to make this feel fresh and new. It\u2019s in their eyes.",
        "The surprise is that, at least for its first half, this newest A Star Is Born is so powerfully fresh.",
        "A Star is Born isn\u2019t a new love story, or even an especially unique one. But it\u2019s a traditional love story told supremely well, and sometimes that\u2019s exactly what audiences go to the movies to see.",
        "It\u2019s Cooper, in his directing debut, who ultimately has to carry the film from both sides.",
        "The star that is truly born here is Cooper as a director.",
        "Credit for A Star is Born\u2018s heartwarming aura is owed less to Cooper\u2019s own directing (assured and judicious a debut as it may be) than to the freshness and credibility brought by his fellow superstar. Believe the pre-premiere hype: Lady Gaga is nothing short of extraordinary.",
        "Its Oscar-bait earworm tune may be entitled Shallow, but the film itself is as deep and resonant as Bradley Cooper\u2019s drawl, and as bright as Lady Gaga\u2019s screen future.",
        "The movie works best, above all, as a melodrama about the limits and possibilities of love, and how love can make us into the best and worst versions of ourselves in the very same moment.",
        "I have zero doubts about the first half of A Star Is Born \u2014 it couldn\u2019t be more charming.",
        "True, Cooper\u2019s film could do with a tighter edit, especially in the second act, where it has a tendency to drag. But all told, A Star is Born is a big achievement: raw, romantic, tragic, and tumultuous.",
        "While A Star Is Born isn\u2019t a perfect movie, faltering in its second act and rushing far too quickly into Ally\u2019s rise to fame, it\u2019s an undeniably mesmerizing one.",
        "Calling the new A Star Is Born a \u201cvalentine\u201d from its star, Lady Gaga, to her fans sounds a bit coy and delicate, so let\u2019s call it what it really is: a hot French kiss (with full-on tongue), filled with passion, tears and a staggering amount of chutzpah.",
        "The first-time director's grasp of pacing could be improved and the overlong movie can't quite sustain the energy and charm of its sensational start. But this is a durable tale of romance, heady fame and crushing tragedy, retold for a new generation with heart and grit.",
        "Most of all, this rendition of A Star Is Born oozes with romantic chemistry between Cooper and Gaga, as well as the stunning command of rock & roll visual tropes evidenced by Cooper and his director of photography Matthew Libatique (Black Swan).",
        "For every nice small observation and delicately detailed bit of emotional truth, A Star Is Born is, in a larger sense, trapped by its own construction. Yes, it can be quite moving\u2014but it\u2019s moving precisely how you might imagine it would be.",
        "It is far from perfect, but the entertainment value is undeniable.",
        "Cooper directs with a sure hand, never overextending himself, and Lady Gaga proves to be a natural performer (she\u2019s more believable in the role than Barbra Streisand was 42 years ago). She and Cooper exhibit a strong, primal chemistry. The movie works because we believe in them and have a rooting interest in their star-crossed, doomed love affair.",
        "You see that Cooper has taken the frayed ends of American culture and knitted them together \u2014 male and female, urban and rural, folksy and hip, rich and poor, finding common ground through music. You see songs move through different musical idioms, and you see the power that can have, as long as people are willing to listen.",
        "There\u2019s joy in watching Cooper, for the most part, actually pull this off\u2014including the gamble of casting an acting novice in the crucial title role.",
        "Bradley Cooper makes an impressive directing debut with A Star Is Born, turning one of Hollywood\u2019s most remade movies into something fresh and soulful, even though it\u2019s hampered by some of the story\u2019s clich\u00e9s.",
        "Cooper is very much a real director, with a genuine facility with filming musical numbers. We believe in the characters\u2019 talents, and spend time soaking them up without a lot of nervous, overcompensating editing. Between songs, he and Gaga make even the bluntest cliches about love and career and misery minty-fresh, all over again.",
        "There is plenty that\u2019s wrong with it, and there\u2019s plenty that\u2019s right with it. But the truth is, in the moment, no one is balancing pros and cons. I just loved it. It\u2019s a film that combines an overall feeling of modernity and relevance with the glow of old-time glamour.",
        "What Bradley Cooper\u2019s beguiling A Star Is Born is very, very good at is showing us how a song can transform a person, or a moment, and how that transformation just might make us fall in love with the person singing it, for a moment or for longer.",
        "Cooper keeps both the camera and his dramatic focus tightly locked on the characters, and on Lady Gaga\u2019s face, expressing the full ecstasy and agony of what this timeless tale throws at her. Like Jackson, he can recognize a natural, brilliant talent when he sees one. And he knows, too, when to get out of the way and cede the spotlight.",
        "Bradley Cooper understands that a message is only as resonant as its messenger, so he surrounds himself with collaborators, old and new, who can sell even the hoariest clich\u00e9.",
        "Credit to Cooper for delivering his best, most soulful performance while pulling double duty behind the camera, but it\u2019s his co-star whose magnetism most draws you into their world \u2014 and keeps you there even when the film hits the occasional wrong note.",
        "Taken on its own terms as an unashamedly anachronistic attempt to muster the emotional intensity of the Hollywood melodrama tradition, Cooper\u2019s film must be at least grudgingly acknowledged as a success.",
        "Bradley Cooper\u2019s soulful exploration of the depredations of fame is an effective melodrama boasting genuine star turns from himself and Lady Gaga.",
        "Musically sharp and dramatically flat, the latest version of A Star is Born starts impressively and falls off sharply, a sudsy, overwrought remake that drowns in its abrupt, perfunctory emotional leaps."

Regrettably, I think this film will actually get some nominations for the Academy Award and in my opinion it doesn't deserve them.This remake is as basic as it is predictable and no matter that we are in a story updated to our times all its elements feel too predictable. Regardless of whether you've seen the remakes or not, if you've seen romantic films in your life you know where the story is going and that takes away much of its charm.Cooper gives a sustained rhythm to the first hour. The music is pretty good, the concerts scenes are vibrant, everything unfolds in a pleasant, entertaining and interesting way but there comes a point where the rhythm begins to fall drastically and Cooper loses control of the story because when the drama and the emotional break arrives, he only stacks one event after another in order to provoke an emotional reaction from the viewers in order to prepare them for the final and huge dramatic point of the story.Yes, there's quality, that I will not deny it, Cooper delivers a sincere performance although in points it's kinda cliche. Lady Gaga does the same because she starts well but when the moment comes she only becomes a more fictional version of her real life stage persona. No surprise on that side.Bradley Cooper ends up offering a solid debut as a director but one too predictable and safe. It doesn't take any risk and everything walks from point A to point B by a very straight path and although functional, it doesn't offer anything new or refreshing.",

More importantly, it's their love story is a beautiful combination of perfect chemistry and wonderful performances. Gaga is astounding with charisma and subtlety that's continually captivating. Of course, her singing (done live) is spectacular (the song's are strong too). This is probably Cooper's best performance, he lays out his character with magnetism and raw emotion. Being an accomplished actor pays off when it came to Cooper directing the film. Not only has he elicited poignant moments from every member of the cast (with lots of lingering closeups), he's skillfully created an appealing narrative (the strong script helps). My only complaint is that the ending, although sad, didn't move me. Otherwise, this film features 2 wonderfully-compelling performances in a truly touching love story.",

If Cooper was insistent on giving it the heavy-handed treatment he should have had the character's addiction stem from the pressures of fame and not from his family background. The resulting premise makes the music industry setting redundant. Subsequently, there is no palpable reason for tension between the leads, which makes for a very lacklustre experience. This might have been saved by a crackle of sexual chemistry but there is none. Cooper looks good without his shirt on but so what? Nobody wants to stare at those two weird faces for two and half hours. Some of the gruff-voiced dialogue is embarrassing (Sam Elliott, anyone?). Following in the unfortunate footsteps of 'Mother!' and 'Hereditary', it's unintentionally funny in parts and boring in others. The songs aren't bad but they're not in the same league as those from the 1976 version. Gaga's performance on the stage is, of course, good but not that good. She screeches out the songs from the beginning and consequently has nowhere to go for the denouement. Let's face it, she has about a quarter of Streisand's talent and none of the charisma. I can see the effort, but mediocre results. Next!",

            "content": "Here, in his directorial debut, Bradley Cooper presents a third retelling of a timeless romance. It is said that each generation has their own version of A Star is Born; whether it\u2019s the 1937 original, Judy Garland\u2019s 1954 retelling or BarbraHere, in his directorial debut, Bradley Cooper presents a third retelling of a timeless romance. It is said that each generation has their own version of A Star is Born; whether it\u2019s the 1937 original, Judy Garland\u2019s 1954 retelling or Barbra Streisand in 1976. This modern adaptation draws on that same arc of one star ascending whilst another falls, but it also feels very different; Cooper\u2019s film is a raw, affecting love story, perfect for the audiences of today.Cooper himself stars as Jackson Maine, grizzled and drug-addled country rocker, cruising through fame down the side street of self-destruction. The film opens in the midst of an immersive rock concert\u2026 before which we see Jack swig from a bottle and pop pills on the side of the stage. Soon enough, we meet the other half of our captivating double act, as Jack stops off at a drag bar only to find Lady Gaga\u2019s Ally performing a belting version of La Vie En Rose. He\u2019s instantly smitten both with her and her undeniable talent. What follows is a love story of highs and lows, as Ally\u2019s success blooms and Cooper\u2019s Jack spirals steadily into a pit of addiction. This film not only explores the personal struggles of a relationship, but the paralysing and enticing nature of fame.Bradley Cooper is transformative in his performance as Jackson; his gravelly tones and haggard gait make for a portrayal that is unrecognisably convincing. What is even more revolutionary, however, is Cooper\u2019s direction, an attentive approach to a story that deals with tough themes. Lady Gaga is a powerful force as Ally; we already know this megastar\u2019s ability to dominate a stage and deliver a vocal performance, but what is even more impressive is what we see of Ally when she is still a waitress too afraid to sing the songs she writes. Gaga\u2019s performance is a compelling one and the director in Cooper is brilliant at playing to her strengths; we learn to love Ally as she grows into herself, with the help of (but not dependency on) Jack. Ultimately, what makes A Star is Born a story worth retelling is its central romance; this film always rested entirely on that being believable. Gaga and Cooper\u2019s chemistry is simply wonderful; theirs is a real relationship, full of laughter, love and resentment. There\u2019s something so ineffable just in the way the characters look at eachother that makes their love so potent and only heightens the emotional effect of the tragedy that follows.Whilst Jack and Ally\u2019s relationship is the obvious focus, other characters stand in the background with Sam Elliott giving a beautifully understated performance as Jack\u2019s half-brother Bobby. The relationship between Jack and Bobby is superbly done; the screenwriters know never to allow it to take too much light but it still reaches an emotional payoff in one of the best scenes. In contrast, a manipulative triangle that forms between Jack, Ally and Rafi Gavron\u2019s hissable manager is one of the weaker aspects of the film, a little too cliched and rather stunted.There are also a few structural problems; throughout the second act, events in the story (from hastened wedding to SNL skits) stream too quickly by, yet the pace of Cooper\u2019s edit seems to drag. These are quickly resolved by the third act, however, where we are brought back to the lyrical pace of the first hour that works so well. The soundtrack leaves one slightly underwhelmed; whilst the film\u2019s booming anthem, \u2018Shallow\u2019 will stick with you for days, many of the songs lack much memorability with only a few really aiding the storytelling. You almost forget about the songs however in the many concert scenes; Matthew Libatique\u2019s cinematography is judicious, an engrossing shoot, from the bright neons of Ally\u2019s tour right through to Jackson\u2019s rock concerts which we see in the same drunken haze of their star. Outside of these moments too, the film is shot with a tenderness that also manages to feel totally involving.Early on in the film, Jackson wisely states the importance of having \u201csomething to say and a way to say it\u201d. This couldn\u2019t ring truer of A Star is Born; despite being a third remake, it\u2019s a retelling that feels like it was meant to be told. Two alluring lead performances and Cooper\u2019s deft direction make this film far from \u2018Shallow\u2019, but rather a deeply moving and dramatic love story that hits all the right notes",

This humility I think has been lost in the recent award season but whether or not this film deserves oscars or not, proably the former in my opinion, the film still has positives and negatives. Lady Gaga is a tremendous talent and excels as her role which she clealry has some emotional connection to. She delivers dialogue and emotions earnestly and is able to convey emotions proportional to on screen events. Lady Gaga only offers to lift this movie up with her unavoidable star presence.Bradley Cooper is a very likeable actor, he has had an accomplished career as an actor so far and his performances aren't always versatile but are consistently good. Here Bradley portarys a complex character with previous and existing issues. His acting of his characters' addiciton was more believable and effective in some scenes more so than others. He was at times overshadowed by his famous co-star but I do believe Bradley Cooper held his own and played a role that no one could easily have taken. His job as a director was solid, the directing didn't hinder the movie but its hard to think of any times where it excelled, which isn't too bad a criticism for a directorial debut, but I have seen better debuts by actors (Paul Dano's Wildlife).The soudtrack was really good, again an area where Lady Gaga came through. Bradley Cooper has to be commended for his contributions to this soundtrack however it is obvious his acting is where his comforts lie. The storyline was ok but it was obvious how this movie was going to progress. This movie tries to tackle difficult themes and for the most part it managed to do so effectively. However, I do think that certain issues, especially the one related to the conclusion of this movie was a bit awkward. The movie seems to be clunky in the sense that half way into the movie they realise they need to start preparing for how its going to end. This results in a drastic change in mood that whilst creates a feeling of dread in the audiene it also feels like an uncomfortable attempt to depress them also. This may have been the goal of the film but then again you could have shown a short film of histroical tragedies which would require little effort on behalf of the film maker to elicit the same feeling.  A more creative way to show the downfall of a perons life would have been more relatable and would have created a deeper feeling of sorrow in the audience rather than just a depressing afternoon.",

It's also my duty to acknowledge, due to the nature of this new movie, it's not a remake that gets inventiveness as greatest grip; Cooper's \"A Star Is Born\" does not conquer by raw innovation, but the suitability of the new takes and shifts that make it shines purposely with a force never seen before in the spate of remakes. Will Fetters, Eric Roth y Cooper, based on William Wellman' and Robert Carson's story, have updated the material with such commitment and passion that not only is the most poignant big-studio star-crossed-romances since \"La La Land\" or the most powerful feature film on music since \"Whiplash\" came out, both of them directed by Damien Chazelle, but is one of the most wide-ranging, honest-to-goodness and resounding inspections on addiction, vice, aspiration, celebrity, entertainment industry and sacrifice in Hollywood. The script creates its own leitmotifs with respect, improves some others, dragging them into a new stylized \"world\" looking to set up a perfectly paced melodrama with overwhelming rhythm, with chiaroscuros making this complex romance drama as painfully as inspiring; A dreamy-yet-grounded portrait of dreams and showbiz, one star is born, whereas another is flaming out.Characters are slightly shifted and/or refined likewise, not only more relatable and true to the running entertainment scene, but to today's audiences. Jackson Maine, inspired by American musician, multi-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter Eddie Vedder, is a country rocker star widely known for his musical talent, his old songs and his messy \"private\" life. Dipsomaniac, downhearted and unhappy \u2014 unless a guitar is present, \u2014 Jackson begins to catch the sense of dreams when he finds another person to make them come true; a way out that changes worlds, but not fates. Although his final decision could be debated forever, screenwriters are respectful to the original ending, making some fitting, enriching changes along the way, drawing a more holistic design for a man who feels his most beautiful song is gone.   In a feature film crowded with accolades and kudos, Matthew Libatique is the one who must take much of the praise. Skipping from L.A. to California, Libatique encapsulates a vibe of naturalness via pink sunsets, the illusion of natural lighting suffuses pictures of a dreamy spirit and the atmosphere of an annihilating stoicism and fluency. Director Darren Aronofsky's longtime collaborator converges lighting, control of form and vision with glorious prowess, the performance scenes shot at the Coachella and Glastonbury festivals and Saturday Night Live are organic and honest because of the fantastic camerawork, focusing entirely on the actors and impregnating intimacy and deprivation into Jackson and Ally's relationship.Set in a supposed present-day entertainment world, cameos as Halsey and Alec Baldwin are guarantees of veracity for this remake, allowing audiences to relate briskly with the atmosphere. Above the romance and drama, \"A Star Is Born\" is not a musical, is a film about music, therefore, this feature corresponds to and pushes forward the plot. The soundtrack isn't as catchy as \"La La Land\"'s iconic and fadeless compositions; however, Lady Gaga' and Bradley Cooper's \"Shallow\" is a shoo-in for Best Original Song, a global phenomenon, a hit aimed by a meaningful, intense live performance amid the film. \"A Star Is Born\" has enjoyed a rapturous reception by tracks like \"Always Remember Us This Way,\" \"Maybe It's Time and \"Look What I Found.\"A Star Is Born\" by Bradley Cooper goes beyond a drama piece of loss and pleasure, fame and failure, hate and love, self-acceptance and selfishness; a fable of showbiz creatures designed in recording studios directed unflinchingly by Cooper and stylized by Libatique's keen visual eye, a meditation on Gaga's career, who delivers one of the performances of the year, shakes the music and film world up at the same time and leaves the viewer a bittersweet feeling, mirroring the true nature of dreaming. This generation's \"A Star Is Born\" is a painful breakdown of the toxic excesses from success, a v\u00e9rit\u00e9-ish take on the false \"perfection\" of an artist's public persona, a grounded and raw commentary as for how music and entertainment industry works, a love letter to love itself, a downright unwavering and beautiful depiction of the little compatibility between dreams and relationships, a theatrical melodrama and, in the end, a vehicle of spiritual magnificence and emotional depth on what dreaming really involves: some stars are born as others just flame out.",

Lady Gaga gives an incredible breakout performance that in my eyes, establishes her as one of Hollywood's A-List actresses. Her portrayal of a girl on the verge of stardom is incredibly honest, and her chemistry with Cooper is all at once cute, heartbreaking, and palpable. Cooper and Gaga give one of the best romantic performances I have seen in a while. Also in terms of performance, I want to give a special shout-out to Sam Elliot, who is in maybe 15 minutes of the movie, and absolutely steals every scene he is in.In terms of the direction, every shot is beautiful and vibrant, even in the lowest moments in the story. Also, from a story perspective, A Star is Born is a roller coaster of emotions. A Star is Born deftly crosses the huge scale and expanse of Ally and Jack's tumultuous relationship without ever losing sight of it's characters. This is no small feat when there are as many different scenes and locations all across the United States in this script! The music was very well written and well done, and Gaga's performances are the spotlight of the show. Bradley Cooper's musical moments honestly can hold their own too!A few minor flaws with A Star is Born hold it back from being a perfect 10 for me. One, is that I didn't believe Lady Gaga's character blew up as big and as quickly as is portrayed in the movie. However, the movie does have a \"music-video\" type quality to it, so this is easily forgiven. The bigger problem, without getting into too many spoilers, is that it ends way too quickly. However abrupt the ending, the last shot of the film is beautiful. This is a great, musical romantic drama that I will watch again and again.",

True to the expectation of our existence, Bradley Cooper\u2019s directorial debutWe all must use our best traits of excellence, as passion plus skill equals impact beyond the grave, sustaining the salt of the earth and the light of the world. True to the expectation of our existence, Bradley Cooper\u2019s directorial debut brings everything he excels at in updating the tragically romantic classic A Star is Born for the 21st century.Before seeing this movie, the horrible, mega cheesy trailer got me worried, I thought despite all the early Oscar attention, this might match The Greatest Showman\u2019s quality, thankfully I was wrong. In fact, beyond just making a dang enjoyable film, the three-time Academy Award nominee exploits his clear skill in acting, singing, and directing. Bradley enhances his reputation beyond just the sincere tear drips he controls, but also shows a grand soul at a small-scale production size that proves bigger is not always better, unless that bigger thing is the heart.This character of his that represents all of Arizona shares marvelous chemistry alongside Lady Gaga enough to deeply move her performance in a way that will inspire any women watching. The famous pop singer first croons down a dark alley to communicate pain whilst the memorable title card comes up, then tops it off with a heavy-hitting finale she put her entire self into. It\u2019s honestly such a joy to see the similar journey these two love-birds go through, even proving how a conversation about some random bag of frozen peas goes a long way.Almost the rest of the whole cast puts their best foot forward, including the briefly present comedian Dave Chappelle, whose realistic speech further justifies our care about the main couple. That doesn\u2019t include everyone though, as Rafi Gavron proves unoriginality on the screen he ought to avoid from here on out. This \u201cactor\u201d plays a British guy who serves an antagonistic force with an accent that suggests slight racism. Along with its misrepresentation of those from the UK, there is also a missed opportunity for Mexican representation, considering its Southern US setting, to make this reflect more close-to-home our culture nowadays; look at No Country for Old Men to see Mexicans portrayed in a much timelier fashion.Although Americans are represented terrifically, as their culture is shown through all the small moments. Much like the mass obsession of appearance, Lady Gaga\u2019s big nose is emphasized, which her character thinks roadblocks her road to fame. Then once her pain is justified, Gaga\u2019s singing no longer sounds 100% pitch perfect, as her voice often cracks as she belts in front of the crowd. Normally, this would prove unprofessionalism, but in this case, our given perspective enables insight on her vulnerability as a growing celebrity. Then away from the spotlight, cute memories are lingered on between the two: peeling off artificial eyebrows, smearing pie on face, moments that naturally trigger laughter with sincerity surpassed beyond any West Side Story duet.Yet not every moment helps refine the final product, for editor Jay Cassidy (Into the Wild, Silver Linings Playbook) rushes things carelessly to lay out little time passage around some life milestones that come off as ineffective. One unimportant component lingered on includes the usage of old people for the comic relief of misunderstanding technology, which really should have been cut entirely to help the obtrusive scene-to-scene transitions not feel cut too short.Essentially, it just means this movie has a mind on featuring the world of fame with insurmountable depth. Instead of brash outfits, the costume designer Erin Benach (Drive, The Neon Demon) clearly understands how color complements human form. For instance, Lady Gaga at one point dyes her hair bright ginger, a rags-to-riches transition Benach accommodates to without being over-the-top lavish. Especially when inside the bathroom, the wardrobe remains quiet enough to even make Gaga\u2019s stark work uniform resemble a limiting straitjacket before meeting her beau. The costumes never call attention to themselves, as the noise depicted by the massive shaky-cam is relied upon instead to bulge out the true emotions. In any other project, this technique would come off as amateurish, but here, it helps authenticate every performance, especially when the energetic stage lights illuminate the steam to represent self-expression, achieving whatever 1980s feature-length music videos (Dirty Dancing for instance) attempted.Yes, A Star is Born is seriously worth glowing on about, even though everything beforehand worked against me having a good time; my ticket was paid out of pocket since MoviePass went flat-out faulty on a night the theater was so packed I had to sit third row from the screen. Yet miraculously, this piece of entertainment, like the passion in superb gifts, left an ultimate impact that knows how to salt the earth and enlighten the world with others who hope to do great.",

The whole thing despite decent competent filmmaking rings false, going through the motions only.

It really needed some hummable songs and decent singers who had genuine star quality. Gaga oversinging like she was in a TV talent show didn't count. Cooper's numbers were drowned out by electric guitar riffs, covering up the thin lyrics and poor melodies. Unlike 'The Man Who Got Away', it's hard to imagine that songs like the aptly-named 'Shallow' will be remembered in 60 years' time. Other reviewers have pointed out the lack of chemistry between the leads and how the story fizzles out, making the title seem somewhat ironic. Cooper was unconvincing as an alcoholic, and Gaga was ok as the ingenue but didn't convince as a star, even though she is one in real life. The movie also seemed to mock her pop persona, as against the supposed authenticity of dreadful country songs or Adele-like ballads. Cheesy plot and terrible acting in fact reminded me more of Purple Rain, though at least that movie had some half-decent songs and musical performances.",

All the air seeps out after the first 15 minutes, and then it\u2019s just two hours of watching the same beats over and over: Jackson promises to stop drinking, Ally belts out another forgettable song, Jackson falls off the wagon, Ally gets upset, they fight, repeat. Over and over and over. At first Ally has charm and charisma but soon enough turns into a vapid, one-note pop star with ugly day-glo hair. Inexplicably, Jackson mumbles throughout in a deep raspy vocal register but always sings in a tenor\u2019s octave with choirboy diction. Ultimately the problem is Cooper\u2019s love for his own unedited close-ups. He\u2019s flipped the story\u2019s dynamics so that he\u2019s the star here, not the ascending starlet as in previous versions. And he\u2019s simply not as fascinating as Cooper thinks he is. Never expected to find the cringeworthy Streisand version superior, but it is in just about every way.

His makeup suntan and/or sunburn distracts in many scenes as he is the only one with that look. The camera is on him in many major scenes, many with Lady Gaga, taking away from other performers.Cooper has made many changes with the most erroneous being the classic last line of the three other productions while the most interesting changes are the addition of a brother and a somewhat sleazy acting manager who takes over the star on the rise and turns her into something she isn\u2019t.On the other hand Cooper gives a strong performance and gives Lady Gaga a sensational movie debut. In the opening scenes we watch as Cooper gets to meet Lady Gaga as she does a rousing, sexy version of \u201cLa Vie En Rose\u201d though not as strong as the meeting in the second movie version when James Mason meets Judy Garland in an afterhour\u2019s jazz bar singing \u201cThe Man That Got Away\u201d that defines her character. A definite contrast in the latter with Lady Gaga\u2019s scene taking place in a drag bar!We meet Lady Gaga\u2019s father played by a subdued Andrew Dice Clay, her best friend played by Anthony Ramos, Sam Elliot as Cooper\u2019s older brother and David Chappelle as his friend of many years all giving substantial performances.Director Cooper handles the love story between him and Lady Gaga with help from the natural chemistry between them. He, also, delves into the masks that entertainers put forth when they become famous losing the real selves that made them famous and how it affects them.The three remakes all have music that defines the singers and the eras in which the movies take place. In this version Lady Gaga, Lukas Nelson and Bradley Cooper have written most of the original songs either together or coupled and even solo. Of the 17 songs there are 5 duets by Lady Gaga, 3 solos by Cooper and 8 by Lady Gaga. Though many of the songs are already on their ways to be being hits I left the theatre not remembering one except the last and that is because of Lady Gaga\u2019s performance.As a novice director Cooper\u2019s version runs a bit long at 2 hours and 15 minutes but overall his debut of this Hollywood often told story is quite good.Having seen all 4 versions of \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d in my opinion the 1954 version, starring Judy Garland, in the uncut version is the best while this 2018 version has nothing to be ashamed of in its approach.",

The director blurs the time frame because he simply can't frame this story in any era. That is to say, the plot simply doesn't make sense - this story can happen to no rock star regardless of sex. I began to feel confused once Jackson makes Ally his wife - like you are a f**king rock star, why lose your freedom by marrying a girl you just know for weeks? This marriage compromises these two singers' personality and individuality, making them anything but rock stars. For a male rock singer who looks good enough, he can almost get laid with every girl he wants. Besides, the fans of a male rock star want to see him behave like a rock star - like the bad boys, \"young, dope & proud\" in a Lana Del Rey song. Sharing a stage with a random girl out of nowhere, are you kidding me? The same principle happens to a female singer too - if you really wanna gain a following then you don't want to rise to fame as someone's \"wife.\" Take a look at the established female singers: some of them can write songs like a pro, some of them have a really beautiful voice, others revolutionize the fashion industry... A female singer either attracts female fans with her resonating strong personality or male fans as a \"sex symbol.\" No wonder I never heard a new female singer in this industry as a \"wife\" of a successful male singer - this works for neither of them. It is not surprising that the original 1937 film happens in the Hollywood; the Hollywood and music industry mean totally differently for women. I have been a fan of Lady Gaga since I was 12, but sorry I can't like this movie. Ironically, no one knows what I'm trying to say here better than Lady Gaga herself: she rose to fame with no help from a male partner. She released her debut single, \"Just Dance,\" in April 2008, which finally became a Billboard No. 1 in January 2009 thanks to her sparing-no-effort self promotion. In retrospect, she, without a male's help, was a talented new artist understood by none.",

The first half of the film is almost perfectly constructed and Director Bradley Cooper has done a superb job in giving us a feel for the places and characters, an achievement that carries right through to the film's end. The problems arise mainly within the screenplay, the story of which is so familiar that the opposing fortunes of the two lead characters are predictably delineated in scenes that are clipped and rather awkwardly written. This aside though, there is a hell of a lot to admire and enjoy. Lady Gaga makes an impressive debut and is especially good when in her element performing the musical numbers. Dramatically she is no slouch either. There is also a very fine turn from Sam Elliott as Cooper's put upon brother. However, the real news and star being born here is Bradley Cooper. Wearing at least four hats as producer, Director writer and star, he excels in at least three of these roles. Not only is his direction fluid and rich, creating a milieu that is totally believable and enveloping, but his performance is also incredible. Who knew? Definitely the best of his career thus far. It is due to him that the film reaches some real emotional highs.On the production side the cinematography of Matthew Libatique is stunning and the music delivers as we knew it would.

Cooper slurs his lines (and lyrics) with the carelessness that this character appears to have taken great pains to build upon as his career flourished - Kris Kristofferson without the credible vocal growl adopted here by Cooper for what I can only imagine is his musician's self-regard.

A Star is Born is beautiful, charismatic, smart, and somewhat a real tearjerker that says each and every obstacle can be broken when someone special is there to make that person born as a star and it's literally amazing all around. Lady Gaga killed this role without a doubt. Each and every scene that she was in is what made this movie very special to watch especially of how emotionally flawed the characters are when reaching to superstar status. There is hope that she\u2019ll win that Oscar though in 2019. Also, to first time director and veteran comedy actor Bradley Cooper, astonishingly nailed the direction and tone of this movie and the absolute result of it is mind-blowing compared to a Darren Aronofsky film. Plus, he even brought his own dog into the mix! The technical side of this film such as the eyegasmic cinematography by Aronofsky\u2019s right-hand man, Matthew Labitique, nailed the look on everything which made the tension and tone of this film satisfying to watch compared to Roger Deakins. And so is to veteran screenwriter behind Forrest Gump, Eric Roth, and the production team behind it. Everything in this film has done right, and this film is at the emotional heights of Titanic and honestly, it's amazing. This film is a must watch especially on movie date nights - you won't regret it.",

Yes!  Sure the overarching concept is the same: complicated romance between rising female star and her burnout boyfriend, BUT Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga have created an epic love story that sizzles with chemistry.Cooper captures mood beautifully in his first go as a film director. The concert scenes are fantastically staged and romance entirely believable. Gaga is excellent, but Cooper really commands the screen... and can sing! Supporting cast includes Sam Elliott, Dave Chappelle and Andrew Dice Clay (who's quite convincing as Gaga's father).I love the soundtrack! A great mix of rock, pop and country songs written by Gaga, Cooper & Lukas Nelson (Willie's son). \"I'll Never Love Again\" feels a cross between 1977's \"Evergreen\" and 1980's \"The Rose\" - and seems destined to win this year's Oscar for Best Original Song. Other standouts are \"Shallow\", \"I Don't Know What Love Is\" \"Before I Cry\" and \"Always Remember Us This Way\".My only quibble might be the film's length. At 2:15, it felt a tad long, but any cuts might have sacrificed a song or two - and there's frankly really nothing I would remove.",

Gaga gives a fine performance, but the overall drama falls flat and seems very 2 dimensional. It lacks the excitement, chemistry and STAR PRESENCE that Streisand-Kristoferson gave in the 70s. Gaga can belt out a raspy song... but 'a voice from heaven' it is not.  The other observation is that this is LESS of a story about a star being born than it is a A Star is Dying.  Directed by Cooper, he focuses far too much on himself and the story from his POV and never get the sense of Gaga being star on the rise. She starts singing a song and then the film cuts to a scene about Cooper. Also, Gaga doesn't have \"it\" ... her sheer on-camera presence doesn't like up the screen, perhaps because she's so homely and doesn't have a spark that lights her up?  The movie was watchable though. If you're in your teens and 20s and big gaga fans, you'll probably like it... cause you don't know any better.",

What makes this movie work is the two lead characters, their chemistry, their stories when they're together, and what they do separately. Directed by and starring Bradley Cooper, who plays the famous star, Jackson Maine, and after a concert, and consuming dangerous amount of drugs which helps him concentrate on the things he needs to concentrate on, he goes to a small bar out of the town and meets a young and aspiring artist named Ally (Lady Gaga). He seems smitten by her, and is amazed at her ability to belt out some high vocals with her singing. He invites her to his tours and tries to get to know her, and she introduces him to some songs that she has written, and he thinks that she, and her songs, are worth something. Not only do both Jackson and Ally soar to new heights in their relationship, but he also encourages her to show herself onstage to a massive crowd, and the fans seem to love her. She gains huge hits on YouTube and becomes a sensation on social media. Jackson seems proud of what she's able to become, and the two start to form a life together and live happily. However, it seems that not everything is sunshine in their world, as it seems that the fame and success can drive one person to feel constantly excited, while the other remains jealous in some ways. The shining points of this film is how much of a joy it is to watch Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga work together, it's an odd couple, but they are so genuine as their characters, it's hard to keep your eyes off. The story revolves mainly towards tragedy and struggle. What I loved most about it is that Cooper doesn't try to change things by making it more challenging for modern cinema... it's refreshingly simple, and he goes through all the cliches but they feel organic. The characters you see on-screen is what makes this movie unique. You care for them, you feel bad for them, and Cooper brings out something in Lady Gaga that I think nobody would have expected. It's a film that may not be on everyone's radar, but you owe it to yourself to watch it. Plus, the music is great.",

You probably don\u2019t know me. I am but a longtime fan of your work. I have been a fan of yours since I first saw Half Baked in my college dormitory. As we watched you as Thurgood have a conversation with yourself as \u201cSir Smokes-a-lot\u201d, I said to my roommate Seven, \u201cThat guy right there\u2026 He is going to be a star\u201d. Sure enough, it was written in the stars. I am writing you today concerning a disturbing quote I read from you regarding your new movie A Star Is Born. I saw in an interview after a screening at The Toronto International Film Festival a couple months back, you were quoted as saying A Star is Born was the first \u201cgood ass movie\u201d you\u2019ve been in. I sir, vehemently disagree with your modest analysis of your underrated acting career.In my very first issue of THE PURITAN POST, I reviewed one of my all time favorite movies, You\u2019ve Got Mail. You can go read for yourself, if you\u2019d like, Dave, highly recommend it. Issue No. 1 of THE PURITAN POST. In this issue, I talk about how your performance in that film is one of the main contributing factors to its success. That, along with fantastic performances from its two leads as well as a smart and timeless script by the late, great Nora Ephron. But I digress. My point is, Mr. Chappelle, that you shouldn\u2019t sell yourself short in your acting career.This isn\u2019t a knock against A Star is Born. It\u2019s only like the fifth Oscar-Baity remake of A Star is Born to come out in the last century. I feel like that\u2019s not that many. Bradley Cooper is only mildly cringeworthy in it, and no, it doesn\u2019t kill me at all that this is the movie getting him awards buzz after deserving Oscars for stirring and emotional turns in both Silver Linings Playbook and American Sniper. These things don\u2019t bother me, Dave. They don\u2019t bother me at all. You\u2019ve Got Mail isn\u2019t your only good ass movie in this writer\u2019s opinion. The aforementioned Half Baked is stoner comedy gold. Your performances in Con Air and Robin Hood: Men in Tights are both scene stealers. Chi-Raq isn\u2019t Spike Lee\u2019s best, but it\u2019s solid, as are you in it. Finally, a film you wrote and starred in, Dave Chappelle\u2019s Block Party, directed by  Michel Gondry, I believe to be one of the best documentaries ever made. You see, Mr. Chappelle, your acting career is full of good ass movies. In fact, I would contend that you almost exclusively make good ass movies. That is, aside from A Star is Born. Thanks for reading, Dave!\u2028Sincerely, Hank W. Mardukas \u2028Editor & Chief, THE PURITAN POST",

Musically brilliant, with an excellent acting debut by Lady Gaga and a fine cast of supporting characters, the film provides a great showcase for its headliner. However, the picture is at its weakest in the writing, which incorporates a refreshingly surprising amount of humor but regrettably suffers from some prolonged bloat and character development that inexplicably and frequently bounces back and forth between polar opposites. This is certainly a fine springboard for the film's leading lady, but it's a story that needs to be given a prolonged rest before anyone considers remaking it yet again.",

Unless you're some hard core lady gaga fan, just wait for netflix. this movie is soooo overrated it's ridiculous. It should be called \"A Bore is Starred.\" It's way too long. There's no chemistry between cooper and gaga and quite honestly, gaga is so homely to look at that she doesn't have anything that feels like she should be a star. as for her voice... it's never been great. it's raspy and deep and certainly NOT heavenly as described in movie.",

Bradley stars and directs like he put a dozen prevolious movies under his belt....and Gaga, what to say about her and stay original ? Well, for starter - Gaga should stop wasting her talent on sugary instant pop hits and over-produced soulless music anymore....Gaga is a a pure rock baby waiting to explode, and here she just did it ! Sadly, a star is born only upon the death of another star. A must see rock saga that deliver it all !",
