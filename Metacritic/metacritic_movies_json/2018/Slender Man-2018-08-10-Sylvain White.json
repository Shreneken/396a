  "summary": "In a small town in Massachusetts, four high school girls perform a ritual in an attempt to debunk the lore of Slender Man. When one of the girls goes mysteriously missing, they begin to suspect that she is, in fact, his latest victim.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "If the story behind this chilling internet creation could have matched the quality of those aforementioned strong points, Sony would have a real horror gem on their hands.",
    "In a movie this flat-out dull, even a tasteful lack of direct exploitation feels like a failure of nerve.",
    "If you thought the bogeyman was slender, wait till you see the film.",
    "Promising source material and a talented cast are squandered in a stale, rigidly formulaic J-horror wannabe. Slender Man equals slim pickings for all but the most undemanding devotees.",
    "Considering that the whole point of the Slender Man mythos is that it is so adaptable and mutable, to pour it into the most generic of formats is just lazy. Compared to the thematically linked and superior \"The Mothman Prophecies\" (where Richard Gere chases a pre-digital urban myth), it's the most generic choice imaginable, and stinks of focus group thinking.",
    "The movie is a big disappointment, because ultimately Slender Man does not get the full-on creep-out treatment such an intriguing character deserves. Here he's just a generic horror bad guy, doing standard horror-bad-guy things. He could be anything, really, and therefore winds up, like the movie, being not much.",
    "Give this literally and figuratively bloodless spooker a pass.",
    "Sporadically, one can see the movie that Slender Man could have been, but it disappears like the title character’s victims.",
    "Give White credit for the picture’s fairly eerie tone and look — darkened streets, foggy forests of spindly pines, shadows and more shadows. It’s just not worth more than the occasional hair-raising instant.",
    "Birke's script is plainly straightforward, a simple supernatural chase story. It doesn't plumb the depths of what might make Slender Man scary, so Slender Man isn't scary at all.",
    "The first major problem with Slender Man is that it’s not anywhere near as scary as many of the fan-made mockups that can be found online right now, but the second and arguably bigger one is that it’s barely a Slender Man story.",
    "Slender Man is the kind of movie in which images come before logic, because there really isn’t much logic. There’s just a movie out to goose you.",
    "A tasteless and incredibly undercooked serving of the internet’s stalest Creepypasta, Slender Man aspires to be for the YouTube era what “The Ring” was to the last gasps of the VHS generation...there’s one fundamental difference that sets the two movies apart: “The Ring” is good, and Slender Man is terrible.",
    "The film mostly tests viewers' ability to stay awake — and the one or two actual creepy moments it has up its sleeve come far, far too late to be potent.",
    "The most perfunctory horror picture I’ve seen in some time."

The popularity has kinda died out.'Slender Man' is a water down horror movie with more yawns than thrills. It's painfully dull. So boring in fact, I actually fell asleep 12 minutes into it. Of course I had to re-watch it which was horrible.There's nothing redeemable or anything good about 'Slender Man'. The script is terrible with endless amount of horror movie clichés you thought died out for good. The cliché of how teenagers talk in these type of horror movies. Not forgetting the questionable decisions that leads to their demise.All the performances were pretty bad and not convincing during the more \"scary\" elements - Just made the scenes more funny to be honest. Joey King is on a winning streak recently by starring in terrible movies, and she's really bad in the movie.The atmosphere or tension is none existent to build up any suspense, just loud jump scares through out. Most of the quiet scenes felt like filler than anything else. When it tries to be creepy, it's embarrassing.Overall rating: Sony, YOU HACKS!",

You know how there's that horror movie cliche where the characters wearingSlender Man fails at being a horror movie, but it unintentionally may be the laugh-out-loud comedy of the year. Where to begin? I guess we can start with the acting. You know how there's that horror movie cliche where the characters wearing the least amount of clothes die at the beginning, but the surviving characters lose more and more clothing as the movie goes on? Well, Slender Man is like that, but if the acting got worse as the movie goes on. I mean, there is some intense scenery chewing from our leading ladies. To put it bluntly, the script is a lazy mess. It doesn't follow it's own rules for how Slender Man behaves. Characters say and do random things that are never brought up again (like the main character being on the track team, which is never ever used by the story). Some scenes read like an emo highschool girl's BDSM fantasy. Several scenes rip off of Marble Hornets very poorly. There are several \"dream-within-a-dream\" scenes that are laughable at best and boring at worst. In fact, that's a good analogy for this whole movie. Half of the movie is hilarious and the other half put me to sleep!Now for Slender Man himself. Sometimes he looks like a bloke wearing a tube sock on his head. Other times he looks absolutely T H I C C. Like, this guy has some hips that just don't quit. He's not very slender at all! Also, some of his effects look like the crew for Birdemic came in and did the CGI. There's a shot of him standing in the woods in broad daylight with UNFINISHED tentacle renders floating behind him. Also, there's a chase scene at the very end of the movie that looked like a PS1 era cutscene. It was so cringey it was a riot.The soundtrack is the only saving grace of this film. Ramin Djwadi did the music, and there are some good horror vibes and ambient noises. The end credit music is easily the best music in the film, although that may have been colored by how happy I was for Slender Man to finally be over. This is a GREAT bad movie to watch with friends. If you actually like being scared, just don't.",

I had no interest in watching it, but she did and I wanted to go because I guess it might have been at least funny. And it kind of was. We were basically ripping on it, making our own MST3K commentary on the film. There were two other people in the theater, and I'm pretty sure they were on a date night and we both ruined it. Suffice to say we both had a fun time watching it. And honestly if I wasn't watching it with her and making fun of it, I would probably be a lot madder at this movie. Because regardless of the viewing experience, the hype is real! This movie is as bad as people made it out to be! Like I thought that maybe I can find a positive about this film, but honestly it's been a long time since I've seen a movie that is fundamentally broken! Like I cannot think of a single thing about this movie that worked! Maybe there are some creepy imagery that worked, but there are far better horror films with the same imagery that work a lot better! I guess the sound design is also kind of decent too, if you ignore all the stock sound effects. Other than that, nothing!The acting is horrible! Like not a single actor in this movie is good! They are all terrible! But I mean even with good actors could not save the writing of these \"characters!\" None of them get developed! They are all interchangeable suburban teenage girls, except one is apparently a track star, one has red hair, one's black, and one looks like a cross between Regan from the Exorcist and Chloe Grace Moretz! There's no main character as the movie shifts around the four leads but they all act the same! It's basically one spirit character of whine and whimper and make faces that probably look like they are scared! The directing is **** Not only did director Sylvian White not direct the actors to be good, but so much of the framing and shot composition is **** He couldn't make a movie scary because it is filled with jump scares! Nothing but jump scares! There are creepy imagery, but it is blatant how hard the movie wants to be the Ring of the YouTube generation! The editing is also bad, making the timeline of events confusing and jarring! The rules also do not make sense! One of the scenes have the girls give up something precious to them, but they have to be blindfolded to do so and not take it off to look at Slender Man, or else you'll go nuts. Well one of the girls did, and yet they all start going crazy? Like Slender Man is a troll! Speaking of him, if you are afraid of ****ty CGI monsters, then do not watch this movie! Otherwise the Slender Man looks stupid and ridiculous! The plot drags out as not much happen! It's not even a fun movie to watch on it's own it's just a drag to watch!It's not like a Slender Man movie can be good. Because it can be, but there was no way a Hollywood adaptation of the Internet legend would be anything but bull****, let alone a movie made by Sony! If you want a decent Slender Man story, go look up Marble Hornets or Everyman Hybrid on YouTube. You want a good horror film like this about creepy imagery and a cursed video, go watch the Ring. If you want to watch a good horror film about scary white people, go watch Get Out! I can kind of recommend this movie if you want to watch it with friends and rip it apart as like a bad movie night. But even then it's not really all that much of a fun bad movie to watch. It's just flat out bad. Don't waste your time! But if you do, just imagine every time the bell rings, it's really just Taco Bell and Slender Man wants his victims to try their new Nacho Fries. And nothing is more scary than eating Taco Bell!",

Slender ManSlender Man is truly one of the worst films I’ve seen in years.  The writing is clunky and on par with a first draft, the acting is stiff and phoned in, and there’s little sense of direction to be found anywhere in the movie.  Slender Man himself looks like he’s wearing a sock over his head.  Unfortunately, this movie is a complete flop in the horror department as well.  When they’re not unintentionally funny, the scares are mostly flat and lame (but don’t worry, the movie compensates with obnoxiously loud music).  Even if you get scared at first, you probably won’t get scared by the end, because this movie is as repetitive as all get out.  As an example, there’s a certain scene in which a character gets scared by Slender Man and then wakes up in bed, only to immediately get scared and wake up again.  Seriously.  It’s enough to make me wonder if this film is intentionally bad, because I can’t imagine that anyone who was making this film thought this was passable.  Above all, this “movie” is a feeble attempt to cash in on an internet trend that faded into obscurity long before the movie came out.",

It doesn't help that the rules to Slender Man are vague and confusing throughout, and the exposition is delivered haphazardly. The ending in particular is a muddled mess.To its credit, the actual scares in this are pretty good. They do manage to capture what makes the Slender Man so scary in the first place. There are some really impactful visuals. The director is an artist when it comes to spooky forests and having Slender Man fading in and out of the background. (Although on the other hand, there is an annoyingly large amount of close-ups.)As spooky and nice looking as this movie can be, the good bits are just too few and far apart. I can't recommend this.",

While it5.7/10 Honestly people are being way too harsh to this film calling it the 'worst horror they'd ever seen\", and just being completely extreme and vague in their \"criticism\" without actual legitimate explanations why they hated it. While it definitely isn't a good film overall, it's about the best portrayal you could expect from an internet horror concept which is essentially a very creepy tall faceless figure that takes children and is seen in old pictures that have been clearly photoshopped. The concept is creepy but really has no complexity or depth. This film at least delivers that same ominously bizarre atmosphere with sparing shots of Slenderman with the simple plotting and overall themes. You cant really expect a plot that goes anywhere with that simple subject matter. The film does drag on in between the creepy scenes with the annoying actresses brooding on in their personal terrors. Another huge problem is that Slenderman shows up maybe a total 2 min of the entire film combined, and the scares are very cliche and standard when he's sparingly featured. There is one sequence in the library that is done properly and has a considerable amount of decent scare ambition. The sound design and effects were firing on all cylinders throughout the film and created some very good sonic tension at times. There was also a considerably solid amount of solid camerawork throughout. Before you know it the film is over and the finale is ok at best but very abrupt. This film is the epitome of middle of the road cliche horror with some decent ambition at times, and is in no way deserving of such an embarrassing low rating.",

If you expected a horror film of the ilk of John Carpenter's \"The Thing\", you're a FREAKING EEJIT.Given the current cesspool that is modern mainstream cinema, I'm giving it a 7.5 (rounded up to an 8 for this site, just to spite you all). Gimme this over a Marvel movie any day of the week.",

Directed by Sylvain White and written by David Birke.The story of this movie is very simple and cliche, it just don't have or increment any new thing in this kind of movie, even the prologue of everything is cliche and a bit ridiculous if you think a bit about it, like, they watch a video in some website and close their eyes, them they are cursed, this is so little creative and repetitive in movies like this. There are some moments that the characters do some dumb thigs, they make pretty clear that they can't uncover their eyes in one moments and see SlenderMan or they are going to be mentally destroyed somehow, and after 10 seconds one of the characters does this exact thing and one second later all of them with the same thing. The movie try to give some possible ways to combat the monsterm, but it is so weak the way that they did it, one of them get to one place to take something, them she takes it and it got mentioned one other time, but it does have zero influence during the course of the movie, it didn't made any sense. The conclusion of the story is also pretty down, like characters saying one thing and doing another, it got so slow in a point that it didn't even scare you anymore, this a high problem in this movie, the script could have been a bit better done and creative. Another big problem in this movie, is that, that the characters aren't much relatable in a way that you would care and cheer for them, there isn't much development for them, and the little bit that happend it didn't really implies in you caring for them, cosidering that this movie is about people in dangerous and not about the monster, they had to make we care for them to this work better, unfortunately it didn't worked out in this way.The sound of the movie are great, for real, they are done with maestry, there are a lot of moemnts during the movie that i got scared, and it was very thanks to the sound design here, it is very similar to sound that happened in the game from years ago, a very strange and messy thing, wich did represented in sound the creepy and crazy creature very well, the sound in the forest, the details that they did applied in the audio section, made this movie be scary.One thing that they did here and it gave us very nice moments, is the suggestiveness, in a lot of moments you see a shadow or a tree, and you be like that it could be that or not, it is good, letting our mind work to see something or not, that did happened a lot witht the characters to, just that in some moments it was very ridiculous, but mainly at the start of the movie, it did worked out very well.The acting is not the best neither the worst. Joey King did a very nice character, the problem is that she didn't had any development, the little that i cared about her, it was because of the actress. Julia Goldani had a bit more emotional moment, i think that she did well in some moments, but mostly of the movie she had a poker face that didn't pleased me very much. Jaz Sinclair also had the most cliche faces during some moments, unfortunately she didn't had much time to work or room to do different things.The CGI is awful here, like it is the worst 10 million dollar budget cgi ever, they did turned the light out of the movie in a lot of moments, wich could have been good to hide the bad cgi, but even with that, the cgi is so exposed and so bad and fake that when they show him, the fear kind of go away, because it is so fake, the creature naturally have a strange form and could scare people easily, but the did invented somethings here with the trees that just didn't worked for me.The movie was working better when the thing was being more of a mental situation, but when they decide to show and interact with the monster physically, things stop working.",

But Slender Man was a special case, mainly because it provoked an almost fatal attack on a girl and because it was perpetrated by other young girls.It was terrible and now we have the fiction in which we have turned it into a monster marketed in the cinematographic firmament.Ironically Slender Man in this film becomes a Freddy Krueger type monster because he comes for you from another dimension but you invoke him watching a video like you did with Samara in ''The Ring'' but soon you learn its performance is the most basic of all because Slender Man follows all the formula of the evil spirit that simply wants to kill. You don't know its final goal and it doesn't matter, he will come for you again and again because it's specified it must do it. Hurray for originality.Empty horror, null suspense, poor coherence, a predictable failure.There are better offers in the genre, this film is absolutely nothing that you have not seen before and I have to say that it's fair to emulate a formula without feeling original but you can do things right but obviously those elements didn't matter to all the people involved in this film.",

I enjoyed playing the game and listening to these urban legends about him, but this movie was.. EH!!!!Just to know, this review is gonna be a funny review actually.Slender Man is directed by Sylvain White, written by David Birke and starring Joey King, Julia Goldani Telles and Jaz Sinclair.The story is about a group of girls summoning Slender Man and when he got summoned, one of them gets missing, and the others trying to run away from him.. this is the whole story!Now, that's what I call a horror-pranks film, it's full of unscary scenes, with Slender Man pranking these girls.. or poor girls.. how did you talk all these pranks from a man without a face?First of all, let's count the dumb choices in this movie...1. They summoned Slender Man from a website, by a link says \"SUMMON HIM\". I mean what kind of creatures can be summoned from a website?2. To \"summon him\", you must watch a video and follow the instructions in the video, and when you're done, congratulation, Slender Man is summoned, go and have fun with him!3. Slender Man is a good pranker! He made me laugh a lot with his pranks... What's dumber than making a pranker creature in a horror movie?4. Oh, yeah, the cast was dumber than Slender Man.5. Slender Man, please, grow up.. stop playing with the trees, it's noisy!!6. The CGI of Slender Man was like a man with some toilet paper rolled around his face.7. This message is for the developers of this \"game\", please, fix the glitch of the faces, and the horror-dreaming stuff.8. One more thing, please, fix the performances too, cause they are bad!9. The finale.. LOL!10. And now, the dumbest thing in the movie award goes to... The script! Congrats to the script, it was super-dumb!WOW, this movie is terribly bad! As I said, it was one of the most anticipated movies of the whole year, but it disappointed me very very much! It easily became one of the worst movies of 2018 -if it's not the worst already-!One more thing, why Katie's father thinks that \"people can not just disappear\"? Wake up, MR. There's something called kidnapping, didn't you hear about it?I think you already know what I'm gonna give this terrible movie, don't you? Yup, it's definitely an F!!Okay, guys, thank you as always for reading my review, let me know if you like my reviews or not, and I welcome all the comments.",
