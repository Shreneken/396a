        "Capernaum is a searing, unforgettable work.",
        "Capernaum, a sprawling tale wrenched from real life, goes beyond the conventions of documentary or realism into a mode of representation that doesn\u2019t quite have a name. It\u2019s a fairy tale and an opera, a potboiler and a news bulletin, a howl of protest and an anthem of resistance.",
        "A social-realist blockbuster \u2013 fired by furious compassion and teeming with sorrow, yet strewn with diamond-shards of beauty, wit and hope.",
        "[Labaki] finds a magically resonant space between documentary-like vibe and dramatic performance that honors the characters\u2019 inherent humanity while memorably framing the wretched circumstances that dictate their actions.",
        "Capernaum is a hard, hard watch meant to force comfortable moviegoers out of their bubbles of ease. The rewards, in no particular order, are the central figure, the young actor playing him, and the film\u2019s magnanimous windows onto suffering and resilience.",
        "Labaki is bearing witness here, and Capernaum (the name means \u201cchaos\u201d) doesn\u2019t flinch from the fact that there are villains in the system. But none of them \u2013 none of them \u2013 are children.",
        "There is an undeniable neorealist quality to Labaki\u2019s work, bringing to mind not only the first half of Garth Davis\u2019 \"Lion,\" but also the likes of Vittorio De Sica\u2019s \"Shoeshine\" and Sean Baker\u2019s \"The Florida Project\" (even though it falls short of the artistic command of these titles).",
        "For all of its brutal, raw force, Labaki\u2019s excellent film is tough sledding \u2014 a sucker punch that lands with the emotional force of Dickens relocated to the slums of the modern-day Middle East. It leaves a bruise.",
        "Capernaum is a poignant character study of a boy being punished for the crimes of a system that never gave him a chance.",
        "Capharna\u00fcm is not without its issues. The director over-relies on the courtroom scenes and the movie\u2019s message is heavy-handed at times. Yet, the sheer force of the filmmaking and its artful delivery overpowers sappy overreaching.",
        "Rafeea, a non-professional actor and Syrian refugee, is the film\u2019s secret weapon. At times, the tragedy unfolding on screen feels borderline unwatchable, but his strange, fascinating, eerily adult face offers a litany of minute expressions. There is a wisdom, a soulfulness, and an icy, angry candour that feels lived rather than performed.",
        "There is passion and compassion here, and Labaki\u2019s film brings home what poverty and desperation mean, and conversely what love and humanity mean.",
        "With two astonishing child performances, Capernaum is a real heart-breaker. It can make Ken Loach look happy-go-lucky but it\u2019s a gripping, sympathetic cry for the dispossessed.",
        "Capernaum is a tough slog, no doubt, even by tough-slog standards. But that\u2019s a big part of what makes it so rewarding.",
        "The sorrow inherent in this tale would be unbearable without the film\u2019s flashes of humor and performances by a cast of nonprofessionals that are moving beyond measure. Capernaum suffers from being overly long and chaotic in structure, but there\u2019s no mistaking its cumulative effect as an emotional powerhouse.",
        "Days after watching the movie, I still have some reservations about how abuse is shown in the film, but it\u2019s hauntingly effective. I haven\u2019t been able to shake those images since.",
        "It\u2019s a deeply assured piece of direction, and though it only plays a few emotional notes, they are ones that won\u2019t soon leave your memory.",
        "It\u2019s quietly absorbing and fitfully shocking as we experience the sights, sounds and smells of the streets where a one-year-old child can wander around alone without anyone stopping to wonder why.",
        "Makes for a generally powerful statement on human misery and grotesque inequality, though some third act creative decisions and maneuvers cause a wobble or two.",
        "While this is unquestionably an issue film, it tackles its subject with intelligence and heart.",
        "Capernaum is as close to unfiltered truth as the screen or the audience can handle. Set in the slums of Beirut, it is an eye-opening insight into life at the frayed fringes of a society that seems seconds from unraveling.",
        "The acting is fine throughout, and director Labaki (she plays Zain's lawyer) has a genius for handling untutored performers like Al Rafeea.",
        "Labiki isn\u2019t above manipulating us as she lightly underlines the points she wants to emphasize, but she never lets Capernaum turn into a lecture.",
        "Capernaum is a movie with a lot of dramatic ideas and plot-points, worthy of a miniseries at least, squeezed into a two-hour sausage of misery.",
        "Although the narrative is structured through a highly unbelievable instigating conceit \u2014 Zain is trying to sue his own parents in court for giving him life in the first place \u2014 Labaki lures such outstanding performances out of the almost entirely non-professional cast and sketches such a credible view of this wretchedly poor milieu that the flaws are mostly forgivable.",
        "If it doesn\u2019t tie many (or any) of these thematic strands with a neat bow, that\u2019s in the nature of a film that chooses raw dramatic power over narrative finesse.",
        "Despite small but powerful gestures in the finale, it leaves the audience feeling just as immobilized and powerless as its characters. Labaki chose the title Capernaum because the word was often used to mean \u201cchaos\u201d in French literature. That\u2019s precisely what she presents to us, with precious little relief in sight.",
        "It\u2019s a simplistic film in some ways, with a naive ending \u2013 but there is energy and vigour, too.",
        "Labaki\u2019s filmmaking suggests uncertainty at best and lack of confidence at worst. She layers on the suffering too thick.",
        "Capernaum\u2019s neorealist spirit is smothered by its sentimentality and endless string of indignities; it\u2019s as if the film is operating as Zain\u2019s trial defense, every moment making his case that it probably would have been better if he\u2019d never been born.",
        "Capernaum brims with compassion for the downtrodden, and that will likely be enough for many viewers (as it clearly was for the Cannes jury). But the film amounts to a series of easy emotional lay-ups, devoid of any psychological nuance or challenging inflection.",
        "Capernaum is a movie that wants its audience to empathize with its protagonist so intensely that you agree he should never have been born. It\u2019s a fascinating (if obviously counterintuitive) approach, but one that\u2019s frustrated by the literalness with which Labaki unpacks it.",
        "Zain Al Rafeea's naturalness, however uncanny, only makes the film's maneuverings seem all the more obvious."

It follows a streetwise boy in Beirut who leaves home and survives in the squalor on the streets, even for a period of time with a baby. Ultimately, he's arrested for a crime and goes to court, where he sues his parents for giving him live. In the central role, Zain al Rafeea is incredible: full of spunk and grit. The performance (if you can call it that) from the 1-year-old is also astounding. Actually, all of the actors create powerful characters and director Nadine Labaki has captured their chaotic life of poverty with humanity and off-hand skill (the title translates to \"Chaos\"). Like many foreign films, there's a less-structured narrative and the neorealistic documentary style sometimes feels aimless. Ultimately, this film will break your heart and touch your soul.",

She speaks of the misery she witnessed, the poor street children whom she drove by one day, her lucky young actor who was granted a visa to Norway thanks to her impactful film, etc. But she carefully avoids talking about\u2026 her film. She\u2019d much rather talk about everything around it, leaving aside any potential ideas regarding her actual cinema. Why? Because she doesn\u2019t have a distinct cinematic voice, so she really doesn\u2019t have anything interesting to say about her own film. And because, as Godard said, \u201ccinema is a form that thinks and a thought that forms\u201d, this complete lack of voice is obvious in her film, which is full of gimmicks, superfluous scenes, and an outrageous \u201ccathartic happy end\u201d worthy of a propaganda film: a (deplorable) government, a lawyer (shamelessly played by Labaki herself) and the media (known for their unprofessionalism) all contribute to rescue the hero, punish the bad guys and restore order and justice. (I say the Lebanese government is \u201cdeplorable\u201d because it still practices torture, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, among a variety of other human rights violations). Formally, the film is shot with a Steadicam and the few drone shots are just there to highlight urban poverty. The fast-paced editing doesn\u2019t leave the audience time to actually look at faces and find genuine expressions in them. Our eyes are never free to wander around the frame - viewers don\u2019t even have time to think, because they\u2019re being held hostage by this chaotic and tearjerking mise-en-scene which desperately begs for their empathy but quickly becomes irritating.Labaki invented a new genre: the cinema-mensonge. Canne's Thierry Fr\u00e9maux made her famous, probably for strategic reasons. But that\u2019s his problem. Film critics and cinephiles are not blind, and they saw the film for what it is: a calculated exploitation of misery made by an uninspired and narcissistic filmmaker.",

Being born and raised in Toronto, I would hear stories of my homeland from my cousins, uncles and grandmothers. From their descriptions of the countryside, myIn the early chapters of my life, Lebanon was an elusive figure of my imagination. Being born and raised in Toronto, I would hear stories of my homeland from my cousins, uncles and grandmothers. From their descriptions of the countryside, my homeland played in my mind like a fantastic Wild West; the stories always had an underlying sense that the country was a type of Eden, a magical place with magical people, a gem placed perfectly in the midst of chaos.When I made my first trip to the country I was twelve years old. My familial roots trace back to the northern part of the country to a town called Joub Janine in a region known as the Beqaa Valley which is nestled right below the currently devastatingly war-torn Syria. My experiences were life altering; a colossal shift to my consciousness occurred about the world we live in and how that sucker spins, how you can enter a world so electric and alien to your own world with just a 12 hour flight by plane.My first visit due to age was made up of primarily the country\u2019s decadent cuisine and visits to my family.I went back at the age of seventeen with my brother for three weeks, and it was then that my Wild West fantasy began to take true form in reality. Streets cross each other making a labyrinth of life, electric lines lay over and under and all around each other, looming above the streets like a friendly spider\u2019s web. The youth is passionate and wild, full of life and wisdom gathered from their surroundings complete with beautiful flowing hair and beautifully wrapped Hijabs rest on the woman as they socialize, smoking tobacco out of hookah pipes that give off the most fragrant of aromas. This aroma follows you, like the sun that stays on your shoulders with strength, or the full flavored tobacco that wafts through the streets and barber shop. The barber shop that is run by a man who\u2019s lost his tongue in the war yet he still knows just what you want from your hand signals. Lebanese like to use their hands when they talk, they throw them down towards the floor like they are letting go of weights and point as if they were being cut from a Tintin comic strip. Firearms are readily available and commonplace yet no one ever shoots each other, they are carried for their destined use of protection, and perhaps the occasional couple of discharges in the many farm fields of the country. Seatbelts are ignored and so are road signs, if any, yet everyone seems to get along just fine. Some ride in German automobiles while some entire families ride on one motorized scooter, newborns and all.Capernaum, the newest film by Nadine Labaki shows just how exceptionally talented the renowned Lebanese auteur is at capturing that land that holds my heart, and hers as well. Her style is, if comparable, reminiscent of the flavour of Larry Clark\u2019s Kids, with a dash of Paul Greengrass\u2019s Green Zone, and many hints of Vittorio Di Sica\u2019s brilliant Umberto D. The film is poignant; revolving completely around the world of a twelve-year old boy named Zain (Zain Al Rafeea). He lives in a steamy, crammed apartment with his band of siblings, and neglectful mother (Fadi Yousef) and father (Kawsar Al Haddad) in a war-torn neighborhood in Beirut. His parents out of devastating desperation give their daughter to the landlord of their building in hopes of leniency with their payment of rent, an act that naturally enrages Zain, causing him to run away from his family into the abyss of Beirut.In his journey of self-preservation destiny he meets an Ethiopian migrant worker Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw). Rahil has an infant child of her own name Yonas (Boluwatife Treasure Bankole), who gives such a contribution to the organic documentary inspired style that is truly remarkable. Rahil takes Zain under her care for some time providing some of the most beautifully shot scenes of intimacy in cinema over the past little while. The film\u2019s heart is transcended through Zain and Yonas; their acting is so poetic, watching these two children interact, with the slightest of movements, give elusive kinetic energy that never feels premeditated in the slightest.Drama ultimately knocks on the films door and heartbreak occurs with Zain climatically commits a violent act causing him to stand in court with his parents. He declares hatred for his parents and seeks justice for them giving him life when they have no intention to properly love or care for him, as well as his siblings. This embodies the idea of Capernaum which is according to Libaki \u201cto give a voice to children who otherwise do not have one.\u201dI have watched a select couple of brief scenes from Labaki\u2019s previous films, yet never have I seen one in its entirety and this was quite the film to start me off. The opening sequence is melodious; we see Zain with a number of other children, horse playing through the tangles of flights of stairs and street corners of the neighbourhood.",

The third film from Lebanese writer/actress/director Nadine Labaki, the film is written by Labaki, Michelle Keserwany, and Jihad Hojeily and presents a milieu in which people are discardable, children are bought and sold for a few chickens; 11-year-old girls are married off so their family can pay the rent; babies are fed on ice cubes covered in sugar; refugees roam the streets; mental illness goes untreated; people without a Lebanese identity card don't officially exist. The film works because it never feels like it's exploiting, patronising, or trivialising the poverty it depicts, never attempting to manipulate the audience into feeling a preconceived emotion. On the contrary, it's notable for just how unsentimental it is. However, it's also deeply humanist, with compassion in its DNA and a quiet rage at its core.Telling the story of Zain El Hajj (Zain Al Rafeea), a young boy from the slums who sues his parents for bringing him into the world, the film then flashes back several months, showing Zain running away from home after failing to prevent his parents selling his beloved 11-year-old sister Sahar (Haita 'Cedra' Izzam). Seeking refuge in a rundown amusement park, he meets Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw), an Ethiopian refugee working as a cleaner. Taking pity on him, she agrees to let him stay with her in exchange for him looking after her one-year-old son Yonas (an absolutely astounding performance by Boluwatife Treasure Bankole) when she's at work, and the trio quickly form a close bond, until one day, Rahil doesn't return home.Utilising a documentarian style, cinematographer Christopher Aoun sticks to handheld cameras and, for the most part, natural lighting. The scenes on the streets of Beirut are especially impressive, with Labaki shooting most of the material from roughly Zain's height, or slightly lower. This allows the scenes to adopt his subjective view of the world, without having to resort to less elegant POV shots. Chadi Roukoz's sound design is also superb in these exterior scenes, with the soundtrack crammed with car horns, shouting, crying, laughter, dogs barking, airplanes flying overhead, traffic on the streets. It's an aural overload, conveying just how the massive city is overwhelming Zain, and again, tying us to his subjectivity.Labaki sets the tone for the film to come in the first shot, as we see Zain, filthy dirty, in only his vest and underwear. It's subsequently driven home multiple times that life is almost worthless here - Sahar is sold for rent money, Rahil is encouraged to sell Yonas in return for forged migrant documents. This is a world in which people think of children as commodities. In such a place, Zain somehow manages to retain his sense of empathy, although he too is infected with the concept that everything is transactional. Nevertheless, in a world where adults are reprehensible, and children their innocent victims, Zain is the story's moral compass, exhibiting a humanity far in excess of any kindness than has ever been shown to him.In terms of problems, the framing device of the trial is awkwardly realised, and for the most part, serves only to interrupt the far more compelling story of Zain, Rahil, and Yonas. The scenes in court also come across as more heavily scripted than everything else. Obviously intended as a means to dramatize how Zain wants a voice, it is nonetheless a narrative contrivance that gets in the way of the more accomplished filmmaking seen elsewhere. Surrounded by the more naturalistic realism of the rest of the film, the court scenes stand out because they feel like a didactic plot machination. There is also something of a sense that Labaki overloads the story, pushing just one too many hardships on Zain, and on occasion, the film feels like it's going to collapse under the weight of human suffering and thematic nihilism. This is a shame because some of the best scenes are those involving Zain and Yonas just going about their day, and if Labaki had had the confidence in these quieter moments, she might have scaled back the socio-political content.Never feeling exploitative, nor glorifying the poverty at its centre, Capharna\u00fcm isn't even especially sentimental. The conclusion is disappointingly didactic, and the journey there harrowing and exhausting. However, in the last shot, Labaki dares to offer a very cautious bit of optimism, and ultimately, the takeaway is not despair, but compassion And empathy.",

Even though it is not as splendid as that movie, I took a lot of delight from watching Capernaum, which fully deserves the award for the best foreign picture. Personally, the movie made me realised  all the hardships poor people need to face unfairly, which the rest of us often tend to forget. That chief reason that I gave it an 8 is the final, which didn't really live up to my expectations. I was looking forward to something more meaningful and memorable perhaps, particularly in terms of the boy's destiny. But broadly speaking - actors' outstanding performance(all the more incredible and astonishing considering that they are not really professional actors, but people who went through exactly the sort of experiences that the film depicted), gripping plot, deep emotional impact, a life lesson.",

If it were indeed a condemnation of the \"Geworfenheit\"/thrownness/dejection, parents would also be victims and the problem would shift to parenthood as an acquired and not ontological role. Oliver Twist, Antoine Doinel and Bruno Ricci (\"Bicycle Thieves\") are one thing, Bogomils and Albigenses/Cathars are another one. The misunderstanding is clarified within the 2 hours during which socio-economic, ethnocultural and geopolitical analysis takes over: the director Labaki is married with two children and keeps us to such \"radical **** distinctions",

It'd take a hard person not to feel sorry for the main character, Zain. It's frustrating and thought-provoking, with a particularly poignant ending I felt. I would recommend this film, as long as you know that its quite gritty and dark in tone - a good piece of social commentary I suppose.",
