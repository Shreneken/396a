  "critic_reviews": [
    "Witty and warm as cashmere, Green Book is a two-hander in which both stars soar with humor and heart.",
    "Most winningly, Green Book puts two of the finest screen actors working today in a sexy turquoise Cadillac, letting them loose on a funny, swiftly-moving chamber piece bursting with heart, art and soul.",
    "There’s something so deeply right about this movie, so true to the time depicted and so welcome in this moment; so light in its touch, so properly respectful of its characters, and so big in its spirit that the movie acquires a glow.",
    "Green Book is not the deepest depiction of racism, but it is a funny and heartwarming depiction of a friendship, forged in a car.",
    "Green Book is a real crowd pleaser — aside from the banter between the oppositely-minded characters, it has clear heroes and villains. The writers do manage to sneak a few nuances in, especially when discussing Shirley feeling out of place in both the white and black communities.",
    "Ali and Mortensen make the friendship feel real, using some unexpected tools from  Farrelly's kit. His comedic instincts help the movie tiptoe through some dangerous cultural minefields.",
    "If there is a big studio movie that’s more generally crowd-pleasing than Green Book this season, I have yet to find it.",
    "Thanks in large part to the winning chemistry between Ali and Mortensen, and a pretty darn inspirational true-life story as its foundation, this was one of the best times I’ve had at the movies this year.",
    "The lighthearted drama, about a road trip by two men — one white, one black — is unflinchingly optimistic.",
    "It’s the master class put on by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali that powers this moving and often hilarious work and gives it mass appeal.",
    "To say that we know where the characters in Green Book are going is not to cheapen the undeniable pleasures of the ride.",
    "There’s something almost inevitable about these real-life characters getting a feature showcase, so unusual, engaging and inspiring is their journey from antagonism to deep friendship.",
    "Green Book certainly paints a rosy picture of race relations, but ultimately I don’t think its little white lies are a bad thing. Like my father did with me, it’s telling us a story that makes our grandfathers seem better than they probably were. But it does so as an example of how we should be, as an aspirational ideal that maybe we’ll live up to one day even if we didn’t yesterday.",
    "In a world that seems to get uglier every day, this movie’s gentle heart and mere humanity feel like a salve.",
    "Mortensen, who reportedly put on thirty pounds for the role, starts out playing Tony like a big lug but as the road trip ensues he brings all sorts of subtle shadings to the role. He even comes to appreciate Doc’s artistry. In Tony’s eyes, he’s right up there with Liberace.",
    "A supremely likeable film. Its message might seem obvious and its template overcooked, but it boasts a warm heart, with two astoundingly good lead performances to guide it home.",
    "When the sentiment threatens to turn gloopy, Ali and Mortensen’s terrific leads steer Farrelly back on-track.",
    "Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are masterful in this rousing period piece, alternating belly laughs with an unflinching view of a nation at war with itself.",
    "Ali and Mortensen are both fantastic in their respective roles. Every bit as important is the surprisingly charming script, which uses humor to soften its touchy subject matter.",
    "Green Book is a savvy and super effective piece of popular entertainment.",
    "Green Book is a movie about class as well as race, and Farrelly rightly refuses to paint a pretty picture.",
    "Featuring a pair of terrific performances by Viggo Mortensen as a goombah with a heart of gold and Mahershala Ali as multilingual composer-musician Don Shirley, the story may be unique, yet it goes pretty much exactly the way you might expect.",
    "The likable tale of a real-life friendship, Green Book lets us spend two hours in the company of two electric actors.",
    "Green Book avoids sanctimoniousness in presenting this heartfelt, if sometimes familiar, story of mismatched strangers who learn to overlook boundaries of race, sexual orientation, and class as circumstances force them to rely on one another.",
    "Damned if it doesn’t work beautifully for nearly the entirety of its two hour-plus running time. Green Book is the kind of old-fashioned filmmaking big studios just don’t offer anymore. It’s glossy and zippy, gliding along the surface of deeply emotional, complex issues while dipping down into them just enough to give us a taste of some actual substance.",
    "Green Book invites you to come along for the ride, the comfort food, the socio-political sparks and the laughs.",
    "Peter Farrelly manages to respect the severity of the characters’ social context while ensuring that Green Book never steps outside its protagonists’ relationship, a delicate balancing act that credibly makes a feel-good, effervescent comedy out of its thorny subject matter without ever sanitizing it.",
    "It’s an obvious but enjoyable period piece — and a throwback to another era of Hollywood filmmaking, resurrected in the 21st century with two of the best actors working today, who elevate this didactic form of storytelling above the market standard for schmaltz.",
    "Green Book is an on-the-nose social commentary that is told with such craftsmanship, earnestness, and comedic expertise that you’re still excited to go along for the ride.",
    "Green Book may supply little in the way of meaningful commentary on racial dynamics either in the 1960s or today. But thanks to Mortensen and Ali, it’s a perfectly pleasant way to spend two hours.",
    "On paper it sounds cringeworthy, but much of it is great fun. Mortensen is cartoonish in the most marvelous way.",
    "Distinctive and amusing turns by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali make Peter Farrelly’s first solo feature outing a lively and likable diversion.",
    "Two terrific performances and the interplay between the two actors – Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen – are the reasons to see Green Book. Their pas de deux is a master class in acting, and the twosome’s give and take provides good company for the road trip that comprises the heart of this narrative.",
    "Farrelly is telling a heart-warming, comical buddy story first and foremost, and Green Book, for better or worse, feels more like a wholehearted familial embrace than a treatise on the state of race in America today.",
    "A crowd-pleasing hit at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, the movie may not be accurate history (welcome to the movies!). It may not even be particularly interested in one of its two main characters, for various reasons.",
    "Farrelly’s film is worth witnessing, especially given how it is now all but destined to dominate the awards conversation. But do yourself a favour: Each time your fellow moviegoers burst into applause, ask just who it is they’re clapping for.",
    "It’s the kind of movie that hammers on your heart even as it’s tripping over its feet, hobbled by unexamined notions of race, ethnicity, and class. Don’t look too closely, and you’ll have a very good time.",
    "Ali beautifully captures the complexity of the man who juggles whiskey-soured, morning-after regret with a stubborn pride in his true self.",
    "Even with admirable acting, and such a crowd-pleasing, inspirational story, Green Book essentially feels like civil-rights lip-service for a white audience, and given the background to the script, it’s a disappointing portrayal of historical systemic racism, whilst ignoring its continuation in modern-day America.",
    "Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are two excellent actors outclassing their material in this amiable feelgood-liberal entertainment, inspired by a true story.",
    "Green Book is not unthoughtful in its crowd-pleasing. It’s just that such crowd-pleasing feels inappropriately quaint for 2018.",
    "There’s not much here you haven’t seen before, and very little that can’t be described as crude, obvious and borderline offensive, even as it tries to be uplifting and affirmative. And yet! There is also something about this movie that prevented me from collapsing into a permanent cringe as I watched it. Or rather, two things: the lead performances.",
    "There’s clearly a more nuanced drama to be made from this story but given the scale, there’s still a lot here to praise.",
    "Green Book is a thoroughly predictable and conventional true-life drama, but at least Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali make for decent company along the road.",
    "Green Book lacks the depth it aspires to, and only works on a very superficial level. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali give exceptional performances but this message movie fumbles its message.",
    "Green Book means so well, and admittedly, it just gets by on its leads and its good humor.",
    "No wonder Green Book, which is like an inverted \"Driving Miss Daisy\" by way of \"Rain Man’s\" mismatched-buddy road trip, is already earning ovations: Intentionally or not, it flatters the delusion that racism, in its ugliest form, is more of a past-tense problem.",
    "There’s something unseemly about singling out this story, about the seemingly narrow scope of racism and how easily it can be undone. Green Book decries those cultural pockets designed to make white people feel good, often at people of color’s expense. But that’s about all it does, too.",
    "Sure, it’s kind of entertaining to see the studly, studious Mortensen slap on a few pounds and go way out with the fuggeddaboutit talk as he tries to shoot the shit with Ali’s pedantic, closeted virtuoso. It’s the first time I’ve ever seen him ham it up. But the leads mostly are saddled with literal, middle-of-the-road material.",
    "Green Book warms the heart, then numbs the mind. It’s a broad-brush lesson in racism, a sermon on the power of empathy, a user’s guide to tolerance packaged as a mismatched-buddies comedy.",
    "Absolutely no one—Oscar voters included—should find Mortensen’s performance anything other than excruciating. From the hand gestures to the accent, it’s as if he jumped out of a vintage photo at The Olive Garden shouting, “Unlimited breadsticks for everahbody!”",
    "It’s a calculatedly heartwarming and good-humored look at atrocious actions, ideas, and attitudes with a pallid glow of halcyon optimism, a view of a change of heart that’s achieved through colossal exertions and confrontations with danger."

      "content": "\"Green Book\" is a fairly true story of a gifted concert pianist and his hired Italian driver making a swing through the Deep South in 1962 at the height of Jim Crow before the civil rights battles really started.    The actual \"green books\"\"Green Book\" is a fairly true story of a gifted concert pianist and his hired Italian driver making a swing through the Deep South in 1962 at the height of Jim Crow before the civil rights battles really started.    The actual \"green books\" were indeed real, and were handed out at gas stations or other locations to help African Americans find locations to eat, sleep and otherwise be entertained without being harassed by the ignoramus separatist white racist idiots especially in the South.    Viggo Mortenson plays a Bronx semi-wise guy Italian who needs a few months employment as his club where he is employed as a bouncer, the famous Copacabana is undergoing renovations, and lands a job as a driver for Dr. Don Shirley, brilliantly played by Mahershala Ali.    Both men are absolutely genius in their respective roles, as Shirley, a gifted and very erudite and intelligent concert pianist play off each other during this two month tour of the Deep South.    It's a shock to the system of the time with a white man driving the affluent and privileged African American around between gigs, and the film carefully examines the strife and attitudes of the day and age without getting into some of the truly horrendous events that also happened.    The film doesn't really cover a lot of new ground here, and has its similarities with \"Hidden Figures\", the blockbuster from a few years ago without being a derivative.    Without being a spoiler, we are witnessing the gradual closing of the gap of understanding the world as both men know it, including Dr. Shirley's own unawareness of the awful poverty he witnesses during the trip of his fellow African Americans, and learns that Tony, his driver lives in very modest circumstances of his own in the Bronx.    This is a movie where we don't really see a cataclysmic event, but rather the common behaviors of a Jim Crow south, where patrons in cities like Memphis and Birmingham want to be seen as \"cultured\" and have no problem with Shirley performing at their private swanky parties, but that tolerance stops obviously the second the show's over.    \"Green Book\" serves a duel purpose:    the enormous racial divide, class divisions and the courage it took for more open minded people of all races to begin to stand up and unite against the profound hate that sadly still exists today, but was a genuine threat to life and limb back then.    It's a great movie and highly recommended.",

As expected, they go from contrary attitudes to an endearing, mutually-beneficial friendship, so it's up to the filmmaking to create something special.

That concept sounds pretty simplistic but this film executes it so well that you don't think that. The relationship between our two leads is portrayed excellently. The film is at it's best when it's just the two of them having a simple conversation. Viggo Mortensen plays Tony Vallelonga perfectly as the typical Italian during the 60's, his comedic timing and delivery makes him hilarious but relate able and is balanced excellently Mahershala Ali's stoic and dramatic portrayal as Dr. Don Shirley. Peter Fairly has established him self as good comedy director with the Dumb and Dumber movies, but this the first time that I have felt like he has hit that perfect balance of drama and comedy. In conclusion this is the best film of the year so far and if you haven't seen it yet then see it immediately.",

Overall it was a decent movie but not worthy of the names it grabbed. I think anyone would agree that this movie is like watching a re-mastered version of “Driving Miss Daisy” with much focus on the recent changes.Times were simpler back in 1989 when “Driving Miss Daisy” was released and the focus was only on the story and relationship between a Jewish women and Black driver. But in almost three decades’ focus became less and less towards the story and more on “How to force the academy members to vote for this movie?”. Movie spills its beans way too early and even with that pace, every single step is predictable. Even upcoming scenes could be predicted with exact timing and words. Either writers wanted to stick to the real story too much or they wanted to not show anything to antagonize either color. And as a product of their effort, the output was mediocre.As far as acting goes, Mahershala Ali is on average. Beside one scene, his acting looks like an effort. For a person like me who has seen him for several years, on House of Cards giving a brilliant performance before he became famous, his portrayal was a huge let down. His effort was visible but he resisted taking risk. Viggo Mortensen on the other hand was closer to the character he was playing. He did not come up with the sharp Italian ascent we’d expect since God Father but his body language was very impressive. Ironically, Viggo was nominated for a similar role 11 years ago for “Eastern Promises”.The Green Book is not a bad movie and definitely not a bad idea, but it sure was wasted to milk the recent black cow.",

Along with brother Bobby, Farrelly is most famous for dopey and base comedies like the \"Dumb and Dumber\" flicks.I was amazed by Farrelly's deft handling of transitions that move from Tony's knuckle-headed ignorant insights to the humiliations heaped upon a refined black man in the mid-twentieth century Deep South by hypocritical sophisticates.Green book is an emotional, artistic and fulfilling  gem.",

Peter Farrelly's 'Green Book', inspired by true events is a conventional drama, but a pure and heartwarming one. Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen), the working-class Italian-American bouncer hired to be the driver/bodyguard/assistant to a virtuoso African-American classical pianist with multiple PhD's while he tours throughout the American South during the 1960s is just as you expect it to be.Both characters are brilliantly acted by two of the best actors working right now, and their personalities, especially Tony's, are somewhat stereotypical--but the genius of Farrelly is how he manages to make them blend in to one another with such ease, such humanity, warmth, that they dissolve into something simple, straight-forward, but beautiful.Racism in this story its so obvious that its delicate to mention it. When Tony hangs out with the other drivers while Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) performs, he is annoyed when Don tells him to behave himself at which Tony argues that he was just having fun. Shirley's reply sparks unease when he says that you had a choice whether to be in or not, they did not--I don't need to tell you that Tony was the only white driver among them. Throughout old-school vibey camera and cinematography, for these entire two hours these two characters have an unmatched chemistry. Their simplicity makes it easy to work with. They are both human, they have flaws, regrets, secrets, memories, rituals, principles--they both sacrificed, they both loved, hated, cried and laughed, and so did we.In the end, the film ends with a sweet albeit utopic, unreal silver lining. But, for once, I liked that. Racism is still alive, yes we know that. We don't need another film to act all knowledgeable trying to portend something. For once, let's resume to family and friends rather than preaching to the entire society. It all starts there. This film is not as much about racism as it is about people.In fact, the only thing keeping this film from being a masterpiece is the fact that, in a burst of anger, Dr. Don Shirley screams out all the concepts and insights which should be hidden so that we discover them for ourselves. \"Yes, I live in a castle, Tony! Alone! In which white people pay me to play piano for them because it makes them feel cultured. But as soon as I step off that stage I go right back to being just another n***er to them. Coz that is their true culture and I suffer inside alone coz I'm not accepted by my own people coz I'm not like them either! So if I'm not black enough and if I'm not white enough and if I'm not man enough then tell me, Tony, what am I?\" The quintessential question. No one could have said it better.",

The film follows an Italian-American bouncerThis was a simple yet culturally significant, funny, and often times very heartwarming and crowd-pleasing film while also providing important social commentary regarding race and discrimination. The film follows an Italian-American bouncer (Viggo Mortensen) who is hired to drive an African American pianist with a Doctorate in music (Mahershala Ali) on his musical tour through the American South in the 1960s. From the film's opening moments, I knew I was in for a charming and great time, cause despite the serious historical subject matter and depiction of racism throughout the film, every moment in the film is played out surprisingly light-hearted but never too much so as to remind us of the important cultural and historical significance of these different and difficult times in America. In addition, Mortensen and Ali play off each other perfectly from start to finish, seemingly forming a genuine bond and friendship as the film progressed. I was especially impressed with Mortensen however, who not only had so many great and funny moments and lines, but also showed serious commitment, gaining approximately 40 lbs or so for his role. Overall, despite the film's rather safe and restrained depiction of racism and prejudice, it nonetheless remains very mature and insightful regarding these themes and depictions, and the performances and chemistry between Mortensen and Ali are undoubtedly the film's biggest charm, with all of these elements coming together to make the film a mostly smooth yet satisfying ride.",

The record company sponsoring his tour had the good sense to hire a driver/bodyguard/valet to help him navigate the perils of the South in the period just before the Civil Rights Act.  Tony (Lip) Vallelonga was hired for those roles and worked with Shirley during his two-month tour.  The challenges faced and overcome by Shirley are entirely predictable – overt racism, harassing cops, etc.  But “The Green Book” is not intended to be a history lesson.  It’s a story about enduring friendship.As the two lead characters, Mahershala Ali (House of Cards, Oscar for Moonlight in 2016, a can’t-wait upcoming role in True Detective, Season 3) and Viggo Mortensen (Lord of the Rings series, A History of Violence, Eastern Promises) perform a series of memorable duets.  Unable to rely on his Danish-American heritage for this role, Mortensen (Tony) adopts a Bronx accent that would fit right in on The Sopranos.  This makes perfect sense, given that the real Tony Lip had a recurring role in the series.  (Regrettably, for all his talking, our Tony never lets loose with “Ba-Da-Boom, Ba-Da-Bing.”)  His rough-and-tumble, street-smart approach to the world stands in stark contrast to the well-educated Dr. Shirley (Ali), who struggles mightily because he is neither black enough not white enough to fit in anywhere.  Dr. Shirley’s struggles to teach Tony diction, manners and Oxford English (Oxford, England, not Oxford, Mississippi) are highlights of the film.What drives the narrative, though, is the bond built between the two men.  Tony is in awe of Dr. Shirley’s regal bearing and erudition (Shirley earned a doctorate in Music, Psychology and Liturgical Arts).  Shirley, in turn, sees Tony’s good heart and envies the passion and wonder through which he views the world.  Spying a road sign announcing a KFC up the road, Tony enthuses, “Kentucky Fried Chicken in Kentucky – when’s that gunna happen?”  The chemistry between the two is funny, touching and the glue that holds this film together.Director Peter Farrelly (There’s Something about Mary, Dumb and Dumber, Stuck on You) has reined in his slapstick impulses and over-reliance on visual humor.  The result is thoughtful, honest and memorable.“The Green Book” does not offer its audience profound insights into the human condition.  But it does suggest, as Shirley’s character discovers, that occasional human interaction, in small controlled doses, might actually be worthwhile.",

It just doesn't convince me of the true story or reality, nor does the acting in many instances, sadly.  That, and mainstream theaters in this USA are getting to be a crowded pain with new recliner seating that has pushed ticket prices through the roof, and made films just plain hard anymore to get out and see.

As the book so brutally states in its logo \"avoid aggravation on your vacation\".The film stars Mahershala Ali as Dr. Shirley and Viggo Mortensen as Tony Lip Villelonga. Directed by Peter Farrelly who co-wrote the screenplay with Bruce Currie and Nick Villelonga, this is a warm and deeply moving story of the plight of a talented world class musician who, like most black entertainers in that era, could perform and entertain in the \"white only\" establishments but could neither sleep nor eat there. The film serves as a great reminder of how demeaning and wrong the culture was in all too many parts of our country and how so many of its citizens were robbed of the dignity and rights they were otherwise entitled to have and enjoy. Although Mr. Ali's performance was noteworthy, the true star of the film is Mr. Mortensen who, deviating from his normal \"leading man\" role, portrays the Bronx born and raised Tony Lip Villelonga with sensitivity and caring in spite of, and perhaps maybe because of, his Italian American heritage and upbringing.I give this film an 8.0 rating and suggest that it be seen by all who wish to understand where we were as a nation 56 years ago, where we are now and how far we still have to go.",

The real Tony had a marriage much like Clark GableMeet Frank “Tony Lip” Vallelonga, who back in 1962 was challenged to remain upright alongside greater authority against his will, except that isn’t clear from the shallow focus of Green Book. The real Tony had a marriage much like Clark Gable teaching Claudette Colbert how to hitchhike, but the crunched cinematic events with Tony’s wife, Dolores, move too quickly. Rather, focus falls more on getting to know Tony through travelling musician Don “Doc” Shirley, whom he drives across the country as his personal chauffer.While Tony takes on a stereotype reversal against his Italian blood, Dr. Shirley goes against Black stereotypes by his consistent calmness. Plus, the thinner Black companion writes better than the pudgy Italian, who is more familiar with Black musicians than the Black man is. By that retrospective, the Italian is internally Black, and the African is internally White. While Dr. Shirley loathes the prejudice of his new friend, he asks what defines “Blackness,” which turns out quite effective for us viewers to hear. So henceforth, dumb and smarter progress on a journey full of Kentucky Fried Chicken while everyone back at Tony’s home eats clams on spaghetti, all where you ache to see the resolution.Between each person, both from the ensemble and two leads, the details guarantee chuckles. One of those humorous touches that fuel the teal Cadillac toward its warm finale includes when Tony folds an entire pizza in half, then chomps down onto it, big. Even if counting the more dramatic moments, small moments put you on its side. These moments kick off instantly with a performance of, “That Old Black Magic” to open the feature, and the momentum of this small moment collection continues without halt.Yet here’s the problem with this well-meaning story structure: no big moment ties any reasonable story arcs together. From the main arc of Tony left in his own little universe, it just makes everybody else impossible to connect with, especially Dolores, who never succeeds to teach her husband anything valuable. While Don has the advantage of flaunting way more screen time, he’s no easier to relate to since he almost matches Jesus-levels of moral perfection, even though he’s clearly not. Case in point: this “king of the jungle” keeps ivory tusks as trophies, suggesting an engagement in illegal animal poaching.It’s particularly weird how this film aims for a PG-13 rating; there’s no reason for it to do so, for its lack of inappropriate content doesn’t mean teenagers will overlook the cheap production values. They’re still used to watching televised recreations of their own drama; most of them aren’t ready for a story like this. As for the parents, the moms won’t take such a boring character like Dolores seriously, since her makeup in bed after waking up still looks perfect! Many dads also won’t relate to Tony’s type of masculinity very well—one that always has a cigarette in his mouth of missorted life priorities. His pompous ego that shines through the symbolism of a stolen jade rock supposedly gets a change of heart once he listens to Don Shirley’s traveling band, except that impact is not felt from the audience’s perspective; the band in truth is about the same amount of fun to listen to as any old street musician.Many other missed opportunities prevent this picture’s intentional importance from resonating long term. Throughout his travels, Tony writes down that he is basking in the beauty of the US south… beauty that by the way seldom reveals itself to us viewers, as the image often lets a map visual take up space. It’s not just stylistic inconsistency that’s the problem, other glossed-over narrative points are missed to their advantage, particularly one hot dog eating contest. Among numerous incomplete philosophies that just fill up page space without a payoff later, one said by Tony includes, “whatever you do, do it 100%.” Pretty deep, ain’t it?At the end of the day, most of the characters in this feature just act racist without justification as they themselves become offensive caricatures, such as one White manager at a theater who refuses to clean a piano for Dr. Shirley’s performance. This overall attitude loses the impact upon Tony’s sin as racial connections overbear the focus in a way that feels manipulative rather than personal. Such shame-filled preaching lacks subtlety, particularly in a poorly executed scene when the Cadillac car breaks down beside the glares of Black field workers, a scene that served no real plot purpose.At this point, a boy taking out his anger through an imaginary tree monster would be better to watch than the skimmed long-stretching beauty of Green Book. I believe Mr. Vallelonga’s story might have been better if Participant Media focused more time on his home within the Bronx, that way we could see how Tony’s unemployment affected others around him.",

Specifically,Green Book is about the friendship that arises between Tony Vallelonga, a white nightclub bouncer from the Bronx, and Dr. Don Shirley, a black classical pianist from Midtown Manhattan, when Tony becomes Don’s driver and bodyguard on a tour through the Jim Crow South in the 1960’s. Their friendship could make an interesting story but the approach taken by co-screenwriter Nick Vallelonga (Tony’s real-life son) and director Peter Farrelly is so familiar as to be dull beyond belief.Tony Vallelonga, or Tony “Lip” to his friends, is played by Viggo Mortensen in what is without a doubt his showiest performance. Typically, his performances are so subtle and without ostentatiousness (even when he is playing a Russian gangster or the devil), that he disappears into his character and never draws attention to himself. This is not the case with this working class, unsophisticated, loud, tough guy bigot. Mortensen hits every note required by his role; there’s just not a lot to his character. Still, in the tradition of nominating great actors for their most mediocre roles, the Academy has nominated Mortensen for Best Actor.The same goes for Mahershala Ali as Dr. Don Shirley. There should be a lot for his character to work with: being an educated, sophisticated, and successful black musician playing high profile venues and exclusive parties in the Jim Crow South. He is ostensibly the guest of honor at the private parties of wealthy high society people but they will not let him use their bathroom. He should be the lead character and we should feel his inner struggles and emotions beyond him just trying to remain dignified. Instead, Dr. Shirley is a reserved, private, and lonely person which is a pretty good excuse for a white screenwriter to not have to get into the head of a black character. All that is required of Don Shirley is to be serious, refined, dignified, and, most of all, be unamused by Tony’s shenanigans. Ali won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in Moonlight, and he is nominated for Supporting Actor again, but, as with Viggo, this is nowhere near his best work. Ali delivers what his underwritten role requires, but having an actor like him play this part is like having his character play chopsticks.Green Book gets its title from the real-life travel guide published for black motorists during segregation so they could find a restaurant, gas station, or hotel that would accept them without trouble. This book is barely used in the movie. You would expect it to play a larger part since it is what the movie is named after. Green Book presents itself as a story about race and class, but really it is a mismatched buddy road trip movie. The problem is that is not good at being either. Will the laid back, sloppy guy and the serious, neat guy drive each other crazy? I'll admit I laughed at some of the gags and jokes, but the punchlines are not original.Mortensen and Ali work well together but there’s not enough to make their characters or their relationship feel like something you haven’t seen a dozen times before in other movies that deal with race and friendship. This is a just a recital not trying to be anything new. By the time Tony and Don are racing back to New York to make it home in time for Christmas dinner I had gone giddy from an overdose of clichés. Will Green Book make you feel good and provide two hours of inoffensive, unchallenging entertainment? Maybe, but when you can predict every beat and every scene what’s the point of watching? There are high quality actors, costumes, and production design but ultimately Green Book is nothing more than a big budget Hallmark Channel Hall of Fame movie.",

Its main problem is while its story deadens your soul, you feel good watching, because Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen have such electric chemistry. As Wife puts it, the film posits that racism is something that an eight week road trip can resolve.The geographic chronology of this film suggests that the country becomes more racist the farther south you go, when what is clear to anyone in the know, is that racist institutions exist in large and subtle ways in every corner of the country. Wife says that Dr Shirley addresses that point after the bar scene when he asks Tony if it would’ve gone any different at a bar in his neighborhood in New York, but it’s clear that otherwise confusingly banal scenes of #notallwhitecops helping Tony and Shirley on their ride home in the snow are meant to signal something unnecessary and facile about the forces of inclusion and progressivism in the country. Seth Stephens-Davidowitz’s book Everybody Lies talks about how Big Data show racial animosity is not a North-South divide so much as an East-West of the Mississippi divide (if memory serves).There’s a fair bit of soap-boxing, self-congratulatory progressive liberalism, back-dated to 1962–what Wife called the “simpering” morality of one of Dr Shirley’s musician friends who eulogizes his “bravery”. The deepest the two ever get in discussing racial politics is during a fight toward the end of the film, when Tony accuses Shirley of not being black enough, which triggers a powerful cut scene back to the trailer that brought audiences in the first place, but doesn’t push the ball much further down the field. Dr Shirley calls Tony a moron again and they wisely agree to disagree, rather than dragging themselves into a nasty discussion about institutional racism and white privilege. There are a lot of straw man arguments that the script, in part written by family of the protagonists, sets up to avoid any real reckoning with racism, and they’ve been more thoughtfully lampooned everywhere months ago.Most interesting thing I thought Wife said about this film was that it was missing a Winter Sequence. There weren’t really any stakes to the film, no conflict to prompt action, change, or growth from our main characters. The lack of a winter sequence is what makes the film a feel-good film, but that also sucks the air out of the script and makes it feel a little brain dead.Every good actor is allotted a certain number of bad movies. There’s nothing wrong with this story being told, necessarily. It’s just not that it’s an especially insightful or needed story and it might actually be kind of actively hostile to the goals it seems like it’s striving towards.",

It also sounded to me like a takeoff of \"Driving Miss Daisy\" only with a white driver and a black passenger which would probably be 'Hollywoodized\" and \"the Odd Couple\" thrown in as the arc of the movie and it is..I went only because I am a long time fan of Viggo Mortensen and was impressed with Mahershala Ali in \"Moonlight\". I expected to see a so-so film with good performances and we certainly saw the latter but it won me over showing the Carnegie Hall apartments, though I never did see one like Ali had. Also the scenes supposedly filmed in the Bronx was not a Bronx I was raised in but all of a sudden I was laughing and then being touched and going through layers of emotions.Yes Viggo Mortensen as Tony Vallelonga and Mahershala Ali as Dr. Don Shirley are cliches in many scenes but they are both such good actors you believe what they are saying and doing not to forget the touch of family that Linda Cardellini as Tony's wife brings to an Italian Bronx thug who does love his wife and 2 sons, along with other family members.Based on a true story I must admit I had never heard of Dr. Don Shirley but his story of being a black entertainer who is going to travel through the south in 1962 it is reasonable that he would hire a Tony 'type' to be his chauffer and, in a sense, protector. A lot of cliches are nothing more than stereotypes and much what we see and hear of Shirley and Vallelonga sound and seem familiar which is sad because we aren't surprised.\"Green Book\" is being sold as 'a true story of a friendship' and it is just that with many laughs and tears supplied by two brilliant actors who bring more to the script than the script brings to them. There are a couple of scenes that took me by surprise which if talked about would mean spoilers and should be discovered on their own but one question I would love if anyone knows if  Mahershala does his own piano playing or is it Hollywood magic?Both \"Green Book\" and \"The Hate U Give\" are two of the best films I have seen this autumn and though both deal with race they are completely different and also have leading performances that should get nominations , if not actual wins, for their performances.",

It takes on many important themes through a simple, lovely story, and layers them with so much moral.

The writing is deft, and the characters are extremely lovable, audiences will sure find themselves bonding with them as they bond with each as the story progresses.

He hires Italian-American bouncer Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) to drive him and deal with any issuesBased on the real life events of Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) the world-class African-American pianist about to go on tour in the Deep South. He hires Italian-American bouncer Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) to drive him and deal with any issues that may arise. Together they put aside their differences and form an unlikely friendship.It may be set in the 1960s but it's still very relevant today and although Green Book feels the need to drive home this point a little too often it's a terrific film. Viggo really has found his inner Joe Pesci for this role and plays it to perfection. The story is well written and well paced but what makes Green Book so good is the chemistry between Viggo and Mahershala. It finds the balance between drama and humour, a crowd-pleaser that seems to be accurate for the most part. No matter how true a film claims to be it will never be completely accurate, so just sit back and enjoy this unique story with a superb cast giving it their all. Can we also just take a moment to appreciate the composer Kris Bowers who worked as a body double for Mahershala's piano performances and transcribed Don Shirley's music by ear to use in the film. It's mesmerising and Green Book would not have happened without that level of dedication. I loved this film, you'll love this film, go see Green Book, you won't be disappointed. Highly recommended.",

His new film, Green Book, employs much ofDirector Peter Farrelly is certainly best known for his big-hearted, light comedies; from Dumb and Dumber to There’s Something About Mary, Farrelly has shown himself to be a sure hand at the genre. His new film, Green Book, employs much of the same warm comedy, but along with a far more dramatic narrative.Green Book is the (though now debatably) true story of Italian-American bar bruiser, Tony “Lip” Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), who finds work as a driver for a renowned black pianist, Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) as he embarks on a concert tour across the Deep South. The film explores the growing friendship of the two men against the ugly backdrop of segregated America.There is plenty of fun to be had in Green Book; as expected of Farrelly, there’s an effortless charm to the film, supported by belly-laughing humour and spirited characters. The script is occasionally a little clunky, but what truly ensures the success of Green Book is its performances (both Oscar noms). Viggo Mortensen leads as Tony, a big-mouthed big eater, impressively humorous but also adding an emotive touch to a role that could have easily seemed like a caricature. There’s a huge heart to Mortensen’s lively performance that is somewhat captivating. This is played off nicely by Mahershala Ali, on usual expert form as Dr Shirley. Ali’s composure and poise lend his performance this quiet gravitas that seems to find its true culmination in the film’s most powerful scene, as Tony and Don argue in the rain as two minorities unaccepted in 1960s America. It seems a shame, however, that the aforementioned scene is the closest that Green Book gets to really addressing its subject. The racial themes of the film are swiftly glossed over for the most part, even from the beginning where we see an apparently prejudiced Tony dispose of the drinking glasses of two black workmen, only to be seen happily kneeling on the ground playing dice with a group of African Americans some twenty minutes later. The film doesn’t just discuss race; class and sexuality are also lingering themes, but both feel all too briefly mentioned. There are certain scenes that do tackle the issues head on and I loved those moments, but much of the film is coated in a layer of sentimentality that, certainly by the third act, becomes almost sugary.That being said, however, I loved the warmer and lighter points of the film as much as I loved the more dramatic. Though helped certainly by the brilliant performances, Green Book’s sentimentality doesn’t stop it from being voraciously watchable. The final act drags, suitably like a car with a flat tyre, but otherwise the film is infectiously entertaining, bringing across its narrative in the most accessible way. In the end, perhaps Green Book isn’t intended to be a gritty account on race relations; though there is more opportunity for nuanced drama, it feels far more like a feel-good crowd-pleaser.In the end, Green Book may be a little simplistic in approach for more cultivated audiences, but it remains a thoroughly entertaining romp, made successful by two standout performances.",

It also proves another proverb true, “To really know someone, travel with them.” I almost didn’t recognize my beloved Viggo, previously cemented as Aragorn in a classic trilogy. But his depiction of Tony Vallelonga in this movie is really memorable, he slides into the role with the same ease as he digs into a bowl of homemade pasta and meatballs. A worldly wisdom, a straightforward honesty, and a strong moral code of a man who grew up in rough streets. Swift with the blunt fists and the sharp words alike. Mahershala Ali as Shirley was also really well played, a man truly lost between worlds, belonging to none, with a blistering genius that only increases his isolation. One truly feels sorry for his self deprecating analysis as a puppet on strings, an erudite carnival showman, a bizarre exhibit surrounded by racism. The lovely message of this movie is the ability of these two men to learn from each other, to embrace each other’s world views, and in the end to valiantly rise in friendship and mutual respect. We could all learn from their journey, especially to never underestimate the knowledge and wisdom we can share to become better people.As with any period piece I adored the authentic reproduction of a bygone ‘simpler’ age steeped in dark racism and hate. The nostalgia of the past is a dangerous thing when it whitewashes what really happened in sundown towns and plantations, even after the civil war. The Green Book is as insidious a piece of literature as Mein Kampf, born from the same cauldron of hate.",

The palpable screen chemistry with the casting is magnetic to the viewer and we couldn't help but be completely drawn in by the quality of the writing and performances. For me and my friend then Green Book restored our dwindling faith in the ability for a great story to be told well in the 2 hour movie format without the need for near constant explosions super-powered beings or great visual concepts suffering alongside the unfortunately crippled dialogue (although to be clear I still very much enjoy the superhero genre!).

The Klan doesn't even put in an appearance.  And this story is supposed to have taken place at the same time when white civil rights activists from the North were being hunted down, murdered, and buried in shallow graves, and black people generally were being lynched, bombed, and burned out of their homes, in many cases with the collaboration of so-called \"law enforcement.\"A lot is being made of the fact that it's a tough Italian-American from Brooklyn who signs on with an African-American.  And, yeah, that's a little bit amazing.  The film however does not do anything much to convince me that the character \"Tony Lip\" would actually sign on to work with a black man.  The film makes it clear that just the idea of black workmen using the same drink glasses his family uses is too much to bear, (Tony drops the glasses in the garbage), but it doesn't do anything to show me that such a man is capable of putting his feelings aside for the sake of a paycheck, especially when there seems to be plenty of Italian-Americans around willing to provide Tony with work.So, yeah, it's a nice film, but it doesn't really do a great job of showing the South as it was, or how it is to this very day, in places.",

Mahershala Ali got all the awards for his performance as Don Shirley and you can see why. They easily contracted each other in more than one ways. This helps to show that opposites really do attract in both friendships and relationships. Throughout the film, you can see both actors giving it their all in every scene they are in. Both characters in this film have character development that is perfect for their character. This is because both of them teach the other something and help them grow as a person. Whether it be Tony teaching Shirley how to loosen up a bit or Shirley teaching him how to write letters. This film isn’t afraid to show how in the 1960s racism was very prominent and how we still face that in this day and age. While watching this film you notice how things that happen back then still happen now and wonder why that is. Even though they do take this subject matter seriously like they should they also throw in a bit of humor in well-placed scenes that helps not take it away from the serious topic it’s dealing with. This film is two hours and ten minutes and you don’t feel it. Really even though I don’t say it that much I kinda wish it was a tiny bit longer. Nothing in this film felt rushed and felt at the speed it should be going at. There are a few scenes that I would’ve cut but not that many.

Showing how racism isn't the only issue of USA but mostly classism. Overall a good movie. Worth a watch and pretty funny.",

Tony Lip looking for a job, ends up meeting \"Doc.\" Shirley, piano musician, and the job that he offers to Tony is to be his driver and assistant while making a tour in the deep south in United States. In a time that racism was literally everywhere in the worst way as possible they gonna go through a lot of struggle and also face a big self learning with eachother. Directed by Peter Farrellt and written by Peter Farrelly, Nick Vallelonga and Brian Currie.The story is based in real facts, and it is really interesting how they make us know the characters, in a lot of moments, without dialogue, just how they are, or what attitudes they got into some situations, in simple things, like throwing two cups away for a specific reason, or drinking and starring at people talking and having fun, it's not necessary to the characters to verbally say something, you get a lot just by watching them. I giant thing about this movie is the dialogues, the dialogues in this film are outstanding, those who wrote this deserve some awards, the dialogues in here go really deep, they do make you have a reflection about many different things and in many different layers, it does teach a lot with different and smart conversations.I like that this movie give different layers for it's story, it isn't a story where they approach racism, just saying that white people do bad things, there is this, yes, and it is important, there are really shocking moments where they approach this, showing how ugly racism is, but in this story they show also that, there are good white people, so as there bad black people, this movie isn't trying to make your thoughs agains one or other, they show nice black people in bar, so as bad trying to steal, so as they show a bad white cop, so as one that just wanted to help them, so i think that this movie is trying to unite, wich is really important.The relationship between them are really nice, that makes the movie, you can got different layers from both of them, not just personally, but also in a society form, preconception, solitude, fear, there are so many different themes that this story reaches, and i think that it was all very satisfactory, there is a lot in here.The journey of the character Tony, is really nice, they first show that he is a racist, but a subtle one, that doesn't make anything better, so with time, with his time with Shirley, learning a lot with him, having him helping with letters, i think that he kind of lost that, showing that with conversation you can solve things a lot of times, at the end there is a really moment of hope, wich worked for me.The film may have some continuity problems, some sequences felt lacked in giving the results of something that was happening right before, it felt like the sequence got broken.For this movie to work, the both main characters would have to play a great job, their chemystri would have to be really good, and in fact, it is outstanding as well. Viggo Mortensen is amazing in here, first his accent that he keeps perfectly during the whole course of the film, it is not just funny but also categorical, his character is very imposing, strong, you totally believe in him beeing able to fix possible problems while a trip, he is definely a guy that you would like to have around, he does that character more like not caring for many things, more swinish. Mahershala Ali is exatcly the contrary, and he is damn perfect, he is fine, speaks like a gentle, have really careful choice of words, and have a posture of a king, his composure and wisdom are really interesting, he does have some lines that are really deep, and i think that he could give that depth in the way he spoke, you truly believe in those words, like he knows what he is talking about, another really great thing about his work, that he could made see the sadness in some moments, it wasn't like he just talked about it a few times, you could see in the way that he looked to the others, fantastic job. Another casting that i found really fun, is the members of the Tony Family, they actually got the real people from his family to put in the movie, that was nice. Linda Cardellini is also in here, she is at least functional, nothing very challenging, but she was good.Green book is a amazing film, it does show the grown of a relationship, as a both people becoming good friends, as a individual point of view as well, very clear how they grown with eachother, and also as a society, talking about racism and loneliness with great dialogues, funny and dramatic moments and awesome lines.",

This already overridden concept on film-making, narrows down the finite possibilities ofNo Bookmarks. No Regrets.Green BookFarrelly's meticulously planned trip goes every way as it was anticipated; fun, lighthearted and awe-inspiring. This already overridden concept on film-making, narrows down the finite possibilities of the makers where they are cornered in the familiarity, and Farrelly's heartwarming answer to these accusations is simplicity. Carrying out the usual theme with a typical textbook structure, there is an ease, almost impenetrable by any of the weakness, that helps bubble up the best possible outcome from this journey. In fairness, Farrelly is not challenging himself. He is playing way too safe, convincing but never a stranger.His fear over going an avant-garde vocab wrong is won over by his brilliant execution. His world, no matter how unfair, is perfectly balanced. Raising questions and clearing doubts, the trajectory of all the sub plots is predictable and yet entertaining. These old methods of intertwining two opposite personas in a room and working its way up to an imperishable friendship by accepting the difference of opinion, just works, it flows.And we may have already encounter the usual, narrow minded and open minded, coy and bold, rich and poor debate over the years in cinema but with a performance as such from the cast, you cannot stop yourself for being giddy up for more. Mortensen as a free spirited Italian-American living at the brisk of his life is the teddy bear of the film. His adorable feature may as well be funny, but a world so tiny and shiny with his eyes is something the viewers connect with instantly.And balancing the other side of the coin, Ali as a poised artist that quotes \"dignity\", is the huskier bit of the film. Portraying an infamous persona as such, Ali's performance is a testimony to his marvelous career, from performing an act on stage through resisting the urge to be parental with Mortensen, his performance craves your attention. But nevertheless, Mortenson's buoyant expressive nature is much more three dimensional and cinematic to share the applause, from his body language to his sense of humor, he slaps other artists on screen with an unflinching portrayal. Your usual montage sequences like helping each other with something they are natural with, this half and half team makes a complete ten on screen.Mortensen preaching on the practicality and ruggedness of the street is hysterical whilst Ali's genuinely moving descriptions over the letters, humbles your opinion as it ages on screen. Clocking at more than two hours, narration flows like a smooth vivid fluid that keeps encouraging you for more of these stops. Has Farrelly managed to make his best film till date? Definitely, but what surprises you, is that it is his funniest too. He is just natural in his comic tone. And the dramatic part is relied upon the performance which never disappoints. The toe-tugging conversations in a car cruising over the locations is the ultimate peak of the film that is delivered at multiple orderly stages. Green Book is an already-read open book, but it never hurts to revisit those pages, the perspective has evolved.",

However, that doesn't change the effectiveness of the story. Sometimes we need a little bit of idealism. Even if the film is sometimes timid in it's portrayal of racism in the deep south.

Director Peter Farrelly brings humor to the film, making it more mirthful than I had expected, but it always comes from the characters naturally and feels right.

And a reminder that Viggo Mortensen has never won an Oscar.I mean... how on earth you people say that Green Book is a feel-good movie?! This is so dark and infuriating!Seriously though, despite its heavy themes, this movie is, surprisingly, supremely delightful to watch. Partly, thanks to the electrifying chemistry between Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen, whose equally phenomenal performances prove that they are two of the most talented actors working today. But largely, thanks to Peter Farrelly's nifty direction. Not only has he shown maturity as a director, but Farrelly also completely understood how to blend his sense of humour with a dramatic movie, and hence more earnest tone and more serious subject matter, way more serious! If he sticks with this refreshing style of filmmaking, and collaborate with excellent screenwriters, such as the writers of the screenplay of this movie, I bet that he will be one of the most popular directors in the coming years. The way he handles his performers, or shots a comedic scene here were really out of the ordinary.The relatively deliberate pace couldn't have been more challenging for Peter Farrelly to stick with a particular tone, and find balance for this movie, but besides his palpable capability of doing so, the script, which he also co-wrote, offered sincere and genuine smart dialogues, and extremely likable reasonably fleshed-out characters, made this task way much more easier. Let alone the astonishing performances from the entire cast.The screenplay is what to blame, however, for these two points I took away from my rating for this movie.First, there is an action Mortensen's character, Tony Lip, take at the beginning of the movie that didn't add anything to the movie. This action also had some consequences that took some time. Adding insult to injury, this action, along with its consequences, was nothing but a cheap trick to make the viewers make a wrong judgment about the character.Secondly, there was an abrupt change of mind made by the same character that, however understandable it might be, I still found it hard to swallow.Thirdly, and most importantly, the illogically symmetric pattern of the storytelling; the plot keeps moving forward in a very unrealistic by making every phase in the movie seemingly predictable. It's safe to say that a movie with a fairly familiar themes like this one can easily suffer from such problem.That said, Green Book is undoubtedly one of the most 2018 movies that I've enjoyed watching. Peter Farrelly miraculously managed to make a movie that tackles such sore themes, a breezy crowd-pleaser. \"That's how to break a peak\", Peter!(8/10)",

Working throughout his career mainly with the comedy genre, Green Book has absorbed all the Farelly accumulated experience about how to make the audience laugh, but now with the help of a completely evolved type of humor – an intellectual one.In the tragicomedy as a cinema genre, a balance between the quantity and quality of humor and the dramatic part is very important and the authors of the film coped with this task with a bang.Extraordinary combination of Viggo Mortensen (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, A Perfect Murder, The Road) and Mahershala Ali (Moonlight, True Detective) acting duet and good story makes this film really fun to watch. The feelings and emotions of the main characters are sincere and real. Dialogues and their accompanying with body language are well thought out and felt harmonious.Colors of the film are warm and bright. Cinematography is solid but nothing special.

Yes, I know this was based on a true story and all, butIt's not very often I'd rate a movie 10/10, but oh my God. 'Green Book' lives far beyond what I expected it would be. It's funny, inspirational, clever, and just so historical. Yes, I know this was based on a true story and all, but everything just worked.
