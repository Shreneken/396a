  "title": "Fifty Shades Freed",
  "rating": 3.5,
  "release_date": "2018-02-09",
  "summary": "Believing they have left behind shadowy figures from their past, newlyweds Christian and Ana fully embrace an inextricable connection and shared life of luxury. But just as she steps into her role as Mrs. Grey and he relaxes into an unfamiliar stability, new threats could jeopardize their happy ending before it even begins.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Fifty Shades Freed has something extra going for it, in that it depicts something that movies and pop songs and pop culture in general tend to avoid, which is the romance of familiarity.",
    "Finally, the Fifty Shades phenomenon has yielded a disarming comedy that makes this ridiculous material fun to watch.",
    "There is something special about seeing a bawdy spectacle of feigned sex and quivering emotion test the boundaries of Hollywood’s rigid traditionalism, and their goofy thrall over audiences make for especially fun experiences in a theater. These movies are derivative, often ridiculous, and, in the case of Fifty Shades Freed, unquestionably hilarious, but they’re also the overheated comfort food I crave.",
    "Johnson has a sense of Anastasia not just as part of a pristinely arranged tableau but also as a sensualist, with all the attendant nerve endings and complex emotions that that implies. Johnson is fearless about stripping bare, but her bold flirtiness is inextricable from her dignity: the sauciness of her mother Melanie Griffith and the marble-cool poise of her grandmother, Hitchcock blonde Tippi Hedren, merge in her.",
    "It’s hard to find compliments for Jamie Dornan beyond “very athletic”—but from start to finish, one can’t give Johnson enough credit for making these asinine movies work as well as they do.",
    "While Fifty Shades Freed, like its pair of predecessors, has many laughable elements, Anastasia’s reclaiming of her well-deserved pleasure is certainly not one of them.",
    "The problem is there's not enough sex and too much ... everything else.",
    "James Foley’s film suggests that any semblance of capitulation on Christian’s part is a win for Ana and women at large, even if that momentary triumph leads to a further sacrifice of Ana’s independence.",
    "Although there are numerous problems with Fifty Shades Freed, the third and final installment of E.L. James’ trilogy, the fundamental one is also the most obvious: the lack of a compelling story.",
    "There is nowhere logical for the story to go since it wasn’t intended to run this long. Sex is everything in this movie because nothing emotional or thrilling registers beyond the moment.",
    "The films are bad, but they are entertaining. Fifty Shades Freed, the final film of the trilogy, just might be the most competently made yet — which is a shame for those expecting the high camp factor of \"Fifty Shades Darker.\"",
    "It’s clichéd, stodgy and overly faithful to the original books.",
    "Take out the BDSM, and Fifty Shades Freed would play perfectly as afternoon thriller on Channel 5. An end to a damp squib of a trilogy which sees Johnson as the only one to emerge unscathed.",
    "Those seeking out some titillating times would be better satisfied by Googling “feminist porn” and clicking randomly. But if you relish a mindless soap operatic story that leans into the silliness of the genre, Fifty Shades Freed might do the trick.",
    "The sex scenes are, save the occasional bit of exposed flesh or brandished toy, fairly mild—Freed is probably the least provocative film of the trilogy.",
    "By the end of Freed, Christian and Ana are no longer a rich man and his middle-class girlfriend, but two rich people telling the tale of how and why they got rich to each other. Doesn’t get more deviant than that.",
    "Departing only incidentally from E.L. James’s trashy tome, and making up for any short cuts with extra set dressing, this is brochure cinema of the most profuse order, selling its audience more on a lifestyle than on any of the lives inside it.",
    "In terms of drama, or melodrama, or just bad drama, Freed rarely delivers the goods while trying hard to give fans what they came for.",
    "Fifty Shades Freed is as boring as . . . well . . . Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. It’s a trilogy climax that should be fun, but it’s monotonous — maybe because we’ve seen it all before.",
    "Johnson and Dornan’s performances are wooden and their chemistry nonexistent (particularly in the movie’s more-of-the-same sex scenes), but think of it all as ultra-deadpan entertainment and it kind of works.",
    "Actually does manage to be the best of the BDSM bore-fests in the forgettable erotic saga based on E.L. James’ Fifty Shades novels.",
    "Stories about the way men and women negotiate sex, power, money, work and relationships — Anastasia ends up working for a company Christian owns — should make the Fifty Shades trilogy relevant and exciting. They are, somewhat mysteriously, the opposite of that.",
    "At least this time, some of the laughs are intentional.",
    "Turns out, what really turns series creator E.L. James on is well-heeled domesticity.",
    "Strip the pleasure away from a guilty pleasure and what are you left with exactly? Fifty Shades Freed, the third and final cinematic installment in E.L. James’ trashy S&M trilogy, answers that question with every ludicrous plot twist, stilted line delivery, and too-laughable-to-be-hot sex scene.",
    "Ostensibly aimed at an adult audience that craves equal parts romance and raunch, Fifty Shades Freed appears to have been written by a teenager – and not just because of its groan- and giggle-inducing dialogue, lack of emotional investment and thinly drawn characters. There’s no knowledge of any element of how the world functions, particularly in its approach to relationships.",
    "Fifty Shades Freed must set a record for the most subplots and supporting characters introduced and then abandoned in film history.",
    "Fifty Shades Freed concludes the trilogy as it began, with a romance you can’t believe in, endless montages of affluence, lousy dialogue, weak plotting, and - admittedly - a heck of a lot of sex.",
    "If liberation is the endgame of Fifty Shades Freed, most of the time we feel trapped right alongside the characters, immobilized by the pointless, suffocating beauty and the stultifying dramatic inertia of the world James has created for them.",
    "Luckily the latest episode to arrive, dubbed Fifty Shades Freed, is also the last. And good thing, too, because by now we’ve definitely gone 100 shades too far.",
    "Johnson and Dornan retain the chemistry of two mannequins knocked into each other in a department-store storage closet; the actual sex scenes play more like aerobics videos than anything actually steamy.",
    "While we can quibble about the underused lead or the meandering plot, Fifty Shades Freed ultimately authors its own most stinging rebuke, closing on an extended montage highlighting major moments and turning points from the trilogy. Tellingly, none of them come from this film.",
    "This lumbering trilogy of trash based on the books by E. L. James has so run out of blood and oxygen that it has varicose veins.",
    "In the home stretch, Fifty Shades Freed leaves the sexy stuff behind and turns into a combo platter of a cheesy, easily solved mystery-thriller and an overwrought, daytime soap opera melodrama.",
    "So, romance-novel boilerplate that sounded clichéd on the page becomes outright laughable as it's transferred to the screen.",
    "Fifty Shades Freed is meant to make us believe that a matching tea towel marriage doesn’t preclude shirtless Fabio romance novel cover sex, but everything is so catalog-ready and scrubbed free of humanity that it actually does the opposite.",
    "The good news—and, yes, we are grading on a curve so steep that it’s essentially a vertical drop—is that Fifty Shades Freed is marginally less retrograde and offensive than Fifty Shades Darker. The bad news is that it is even more idiotic, which is in its way a remarkable achievement.",
    "As popular as this window-fogging franchise has become, its flaccid finale is likely critic proof. But if I can persuade just one of you to bypass its milquetoast masochism and watch the stratospherically superior “9 1/2 Weeks” instead, then I will have done my job.",
    "As usual it’s left entirely up to the beleaguered Johnson to make any of it even remotely watchable. She remains a compelling presence, trying her darnedest with lifeless words, but, again, she’s stranded by the energy-sucking vortex of nothingness that is Jamie Dornan. He’s better than this...but he knows it and his boredom is lazily apparent throughout.",
    "This is a film in which one of the more emotionally detailed performances is given by a product-placement Audi.",
    "Give or take one excellent joke about the practical applications of handcuffs — delivered with expert awkwardness by Dakota Johnson, who remains the only moderately charming element of the trilogy — the film is as devoid of wit as it is of subtlety, and that combined absence, courtesy of screenwriter Niall Leonard, leads to some of its biggest unintentional laughs.",
    "The biggest takeaway from the film is that the American foster-care system has failed us all. And that’s super sexy.",
    "With this last entry, we have officially hit the bottom of the barrel. Whips, chains, butt plugs and nipple clips are nothing compared to the sheer torture of watching this movie."

It's possible to define the incongruousness, incompetence, absurdity, pedantry of this script in just one two-word line, which is paraphrased by the great actress Dakota Johnson through, sadly, the role giving her worldwide reputation. That affirmation takes place in the initial scenes of the film, where they want to celebrate a major event, and she said it with such insolence that is offensive: \"Is it yours?\" What? How is it possible that after a year and a half sleeping together in the same bed, an enviable salary and an almost-a-trillion-dollar grossing she doesn't know that she must stop talking nonsense, he's your husband now, you know he has tons of money, don't you?, with just one sentence, this film provoked an absolute suppression of a serious and rigid review, therefore, I simply sat down on that dark seat to capture blunders and blunders from the beginning of the action to the arrive of the closing credits, I survived miraculously. Normally, in my reviews I talk about performances in a positive way, i.e., if such a component isn't a strong point in the film I opt to omit it, however, most of the time I evaluated them since they are a fundamental part in the harmonious ensemble that made up a feature film. With surmised anticipation, \"Freed\" has broken the rule. I'm ready to write, with the utmost respect and humility, about Jamie Dornan, Eric Johnson and the remaining cast, except Dakota, who performed lousy characters, at least, that keeps it coherent. Likewise, the leading male character never loses that look of concern or that frown when some fatuous vicissitudes arise in the script, we never knew about which \"fifty\" shadows they've been spoken for more than three hours, he simply seems to be an eye-candy and something else. Dakota Johnson is the only one who impregnates a bit of love on her character, half-heartedly. All right, she's tender, naïve and unnecessarily submissive, but Johnson knows how to turn the card around and get the spectator to try to accept her motivations, an event that never happens. It's cumbersome and delicate to talk about this feature owing to its nature but it's a matter to discuss: the sexual scenes. It's not a secret that for many people the main motive inciting them (mostly young people) to attend a theatre is the curiosity to watch them surrounded by a considerable number of people, a couple having peculiar erotic relations, intimate acts portrayed on the screen smoother than the explicit and bawdy descriptions by the author in the books. Inside a tub, at Mia's, in red rooms, black rooms, cars or beds, any cliché and \"coveted\" place will have the shameful DNA of \"Freed\". Artistically, they aren't a feat of art, shots that focus on Anastasia's panting mouth or Christian's muscular back, arrhythmic sequences in which you can feel the lack of feeling between these actors, and even so Dornan claims that he made sure to make his co-star laugh in this kind of scene, I think it was in the final cut. Nor does it have much to brag about in visual terms. From Seattle cold landscapes to luxurious closed spaces, the movie is, almost entirely, locked in the city and in burdensome rooms, only a couple of scenes were filmed in a forest. Metallic colors predominate and a beautiful white is only glimpsed at the beginning, a necessary contrast of repetitive dark nuances. In a nutshell, visually, you expect on the screen, again and again, Johnson's breasts and the same black shoes that Christian wears in two different scenes.Easily the best part of all this suffering: a fantastic musical accompaniment. And we don't talk about the work done by Danny Elfman, usual composer of the franchise, we refer (again) to catchy hits from artists such as Julia Michaels or Rita Ora and Liam Payne, who take part of a score that will be the next playlist for millennials for a while, electronic danceable sounds provide a kind of uninhibited tone to the scenes, the sad thing here is that even these songs are inserted in a wrong way. Christian closing the door of his red room in the face of his audience is a cynical sign of the little importance that the demanding public meant to this franchise.  \"Fifty Shades Freed\" by James Foley finally says goodbye to the goose that lays golden eggs, bye bye melodramatic loves and dopey plot decisions, gone are those dark times, the light has come not only for the protagonist, also for the public. The short summary created by the flick in the third act, shows the abysmal decay that the movie suffered, simply to conclude with an ending as stereotyped as the film itself. The movie franchise was a very tough nut to crack, but Universal Pictures has broken hearts this Valentine's Day, because its great love, that lover which gave it exorbitant amounts of money, is gone forever, so they say.",

You know the one. The rich dude and yer one spend three movies living up the rich life etc etc. At long last we can say farewell to the Fifty Shades of Grey saga.It's the final chapter, they get married and live happily ever after. Only they get married and then Anastasia discovers Christian doesn't want kids right now, but maybe \"some day\" and also to her surprise she discovers he has a private jet, you know, the kind of stuff any person would be perfectly happy to find out AFTER they get married. If there was a point to this movie I wish someone would tell me because as far as I could see there was no need for this to even exist. A good portion of the film is Christian Grey getting insanely paranoid because his wife doesn't use his last name the second after they get married but it's okay (because he's rich) because he just cares so much. He controls every single aspect of her life but it's okay (because he's rich) because he loves her so much. And he doesn't want her to go out with her friends after work but it's okay (because he's rich) because he doesn't want any harm to come to poor useless, helpless Anastasia. You know all the typical traits of a (psychopath) loving husband. They're starting their new life together, buying a house, getting stalked, going on extravagant holidays, nearly getting kidnapped. You know the usual stuff. As if the story wasn't bad enough each and every line is delivered in a way I was beginning to think this was meant to be a comedy. Hysterically terrible. At one point Christian Grey decides to serenade everyone with a rendition of Maybe I'm Amazed on the piano. But he doesn't just play it, no he sings along too, much to everyone's shock and horror because hard as nails Christian has never sang in front of anyone before and look at this shocking revelation oh my goodness he really must be in love with whats her face cause why else would he break into song and quick someone get me a bucket before I'm violently ill. This is a scene so random and ridiculous the whole cinema found it hilarious. Let me be clear, at no point were we laughing with this film. We were laughing at it.When I say I loathed this pathetic excuse for a film you know I mean it. If I remember correctly the first one never set the bar very high but this is so much worse. I honestly don't know what the point of Fifty Shades Freed was, they get married and dramatic soap opera stuff happens occasionally, then they go into the play room, then even more dramatic stuff happens. Cringey beyond all reason, enough to drive one mad. There was never a shred of chemistry between Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson so watching the two of them on screen is just painful. Torture, I wanted it to end, unfortunately it has made it's money back and then some but hopefully this is the last we'll hear of Fifty Shades of Grey, a piece of fanfiction that never should have made it into book stores let alone on the big screen.

Yet for a film which encourages you not to \"miss the climax\", it is pretty anticlimactic.The first hour of the film is as dreary as you can expect. We start with a poorly edited 5-minute intro presented as a slideshow of Christian (Jamie Dornan) and Anastasia's (Dakota Johnson) marriage and their honeymoon all enveloped in a tasteless, generic, simplistic EDM love song. And while the music accompanying this film doesn't get better, at least it eventually stops. Not the same can be said for the aforementioned slideshow, though.Just like the previous films, this focuses too much on Christian and Anastasia. Even when problems knock at their door, all we are given is a cheesy soap-opera style slideshow of pointless discussions surrounded by so many opulent backdrops that you would think this is an Architectural Digest presentation. The reason why there is such an insistent focus on Christian and Ana's relationship (other than the fact they are the main characters, duh) is because I feel director James Foley is unsatisfied with their chemistry (or lack thereof). But between constant \"red room\" scenes and bland flirting, there is not much more.A few scenes did peek my interest though. The scene in which Christian came home drunk after finding that Ana is pregnant offered some really sweet down-to-earth interactions or their first sex scene in which, finally, there was some actual sexual and powerful messages, as Christian asks: \"Why do you defy me?\"; \"Because I can\" says Ana as they perform sexual intercourse. This was finally an intimate moment with a bit of naughtiness and insight. Speaking of Ana, Dakota Johnson tries her absolute best to liven up Dornan's empty personality, and it's interesting seeing her transformation to Miss Grey, but she can only do so much.In the last 30 minutes of the film, we are presented with a bland ransom scene which turns this into an action flick. I don't mind this. Actually, its the best thing in this film because something was happening. But, again, this scene was awfully paced making it really really anticlimactic; not to mention characters like Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson) and \"Mrs. Robinson\" (Kim Basinger) were really wasted.In the end, this film attempts many things; but for some reason, it shuts them down early with merciless editing and pacing, but as I watched the ending which included a basic montage of the three films I felt a certain closure but also regret seeing an ambition which was cluttered by millennial agendas and too many Audis... what a shame. The steak looked great though, I mean Chirstian loved it and he is not the kind of guy who eats at McDonald's.",

It starts with their marriage and honeymoon, but soon turns dark when a character from their past returns. Although there's plenty of nudity, the sex scenes lacked much eroticism and the S&M component was strictly PG-rated. The plot is predictable and uninteresting. It doesn’t help that the soundtrack pounds home the character’s every emotional state with often ridiculously literal lyrics. Still, the performances by the duo are sufficiently compelling to make it a passable finish to the saga.",

The story opens with the wedding of Anastasia (Dakota Johnson), and Christian (Jamie Dornan), and follows their honeymoon in the lavish locales of France.There getaway is cut short by an act of sabotage at Christian’s company and it soon becomes clear that a person from their past has taken things to a dangerous level which requires Christian to implement security measures for Anastasia and their extended family.In between the intrigue presented by the threat, we also have numerous scenes of nudity and eroticism as Christian is not going to give up his dominating needs anytime soon.Combine this with a new revelation that threatens to disrupt the crafted and controlled world he has created for himself and Anastasia; the tensions rise between them making a dangerous and stress-filled situation even more complicated.While the film does have a better plot and is more engaging than the previous films in the series it is hampered by many of the same issues that hindered the series. The two leads have zero chemistry with one another and their supposedly highly erotic scenes are so routine and by the numbers they lack any form of excitement or real titillation. The film also has this message that behavior that would be considered highly unacceptable in others seems to get a pass for Christian as he is a handsome billionaire. He is a very selfish and controlling individual who demands obedience. While Anastasia does have a strong enough character to stand up to him, she tolerates behavior that would be considered unacceptable by many and seems very quick to give him a pass when lavish gifts and trips are bestowed upon her. I wonder how romantic and acceptable his behavior would be if he was a struggling musician who did not have the financial resources to create fantasies and buy his apologies. I know the film is supposed to be romantic fantasy but this really annoys me as he exhibits much of the behavior that is considered unacceptable and to be avoided at all costs, yet it is all wrapped up in a sweet bow of forgiveness.That aside the series does seem to be losing steam as the last film earned less than the original film and “Fifty Shades Freed” is tracking to open well below the last film as well.  Fans of the series will likely enjoy it as a satisfying finale, but I really expected more from the final moments of the series as after following the characters, the ending seemed very anti-climactic.2.5 stars out of 5.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nIf you want to check out our video review of this look us up on Youtube - Digital AddictionFifty Shades Freed is the third and final installment of the book to movie adaption of the same name. Fifty Shades Freed is one of those movies that most single guys would never be caught dead watching and if they are it’s a guilty pleasure they should probably keep to themselves. But when you are married or in a relationship then you know why we have to do our part and succumb to Hollywood's clever marketing along with its Valentine’s Day week releases for getting women to see these movies. So to sum up the plot real quick. Fifty shades free is  Sappy Love story for 5 minutes, softcore porn, Marital Strife, softcore porn, car chase, softcore porn, evil people, softcore porn, everyone is happy, and more softcore porn. So even if you do take your Significant other to see this movie there are definitely things to satisfy both parties erotic side and if your into seeing a lot of nipples and women licking ice cream off of mans bush, then this movie is definitely for you. Lets just say never trust a man who has drawers lined with perfectly placed vibrators and butt plugs.  But lets go into more detail about….other things. The movie follows up Fifty Shades Darker with Anastasia played by Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan reprising his role as Christian grey. Freed starts off with them getting married and then onto a bunch of very scenic shots of them traveling Europe for what we can assume is their honeymoon. Their vacation is cut short due to an incident at Mr. Grey's business where they quickly reveal the perpetrator is Anastasias old boss/stalker Jack Hyde. Jack seems to have some kind of vengeance out for Christian and you find out why later in the movie. Most of the movie is filled with the obvious fact that now that christian has the woman he wants, he has a huge issue with jealousy. Anastasia likes to go against christians will and do things her way and in turn…. You guessed it, more softcore porn, only this time its for annas punishment. This also goes for anastasia towards christian for example their architect for their new home is awfully touchy and anastasia quickly puts an end to it by throwing her newly aquired power around. Throughout the movie you quickly see anna start to break out of her shell and rebel. The acting and screenwriting in this movie is just as you would expect. Cheesy, sappy, and just plain akward. But it works.  Dornan's acting reminds me of Hayden Christensen's in the New star wars trilogy. A laughable character in the movie is one of the Grey's bodyguards Sawyer. I don’t know if this screenplay was written for him to look like a robot or its his acting but he reminds you of the t1000 from terminator. I guess that’s a good thing if you are paying for him to protect you though. The only one that gets full credit here is Dakota Johnson as she does a great job in this film and definitely would be someone I would like to see on screen again… and no not just because of her boobs.The movie has a great upbeat soundtrack and actually moves at a pretty good pace if you can put up with the terrible story and characters. If you are into such a far fetched fantasy where you can let your wife or girlfriend drive your heavily advertised Audio R8 and she instantly becomes a stunt car driver that then follows that up with being so turned on that after being chased by a bad guy she has to **** you in the first parking space she finds, then you will love this movie. For the majority of us this movie is definitely passable. But seeing that they keep releasing these on valentines day it is our duty as men to take our woman to see these films. The only good thing is that these books and movies were written with one thing in mind and if your lucky, you may get lucky if you know what I mean.",

For me, the end of a bad cinematic experience that did not make up for the time spent watching the films. Totally devastated by the critics, however, it was a box office success, as were the two films that preceded it. As I did in the criticism of the two other films, I emphasize here that I did not read or intend to read the original books, so I will speak only of the film, despite knowing that many problems related to the story told come from the bad original material.Finally, Gray and Anastasia get married ... and finally we have a film with some plot in addition to endless rough sex sessions. Yes, this film is what I think has a better script and a more interesting story, mainly because of its ending and the permanent threat that Jack Hyde will pose to the Gray couple. The film starts well, with an invasion of the offices of Gray companies and the theft of documents related to Christian and his family. We soon realized that the dream wedding is going to be threatened. The problem is that, even with this noticeable improvement, everything is still so predictable that a five year old child would be able to guess everything that will happen without needing, exactly, a crystal ball.Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson continue to be bad actors and do very amateur work, as in previous films. Eric Johnson, who even pleased me in the previous film, skids completely here and becomes a kind of conventional villain that scares no one. Kim Basinger ends his performance as an extra with lines, in a cameo that stinks of the vestigial sub-plot, severely amputated in the post-production room. The problem of bad dialogues is still very much present, and I start to think that this may be linked to the bad material from the film. It is also the film with the worst sex scenes in the trilogy. They look like machines that turn on and off, there is no passion or desire whatsoever. Okay, I'm not a fan of such intense sex scenes at all, but given that the film requires them, they could at least have done something better.It goes without saying that this film is totally inappropriate for children and teenagers, given the erotic material and the language used. The film had a good budget and, therefore, good production values, starting with good photography, good scene props, satisfactory editing work and a good soundtrack, composed by Danny Elfman and with good songs, like \"Love me Like You Do \".",
