    "critic_reviews": [
        "Far from lazy, it is a fairly brilliant sendup of comic-book action movies, as well as also being an excellent example of one.",
        "The film ends on a remarkably touching emotional note. Had it held to the strength of its convictions\u2014and it is immensely obvious why it did not\u2014it might have been the best ending of any superhero movie to date. (No, the bar\u2019s not terribly high.) But it\u2019s nonetheless awfully good, and we can still look forward to, mid-credits, the world\u2019s best-ever Green Lantern joke.",
        "A superhero movie so tightly made and brilliantly entertaining that even Deadpool himself would have trouble finding fault with it.",
        "Deadpool 2 is wicked, dark fun from start to finish, with some twisted and very funny special effects, cool production elements, terrific ensemble work \u2014 and for dessert, perhaps the best end-credits \u201ccookie\u201d scene ever.",
        "Deadpool 2 throws everything it has at you until you throw your arms up in happy surrender.",
        "Is Deadpool 2 obnoxious? Is it needlessly self-aware? Is it drunk on its own fairly tame naughtiness? Is it so stuffed full of unrelated pop culture references that it sort of feels like a meme shirt come to life? The answer to all those questions is a resounding yes, but it\u2019s also, weirdly, refreshing.",
        "Deadpool 2, while extremely thin on plot, is gleefully impish, entertaining and often laugh-out-loud funny. Almost everything that felt forced, crass and hamfisted in the original film now feels organic and effortless; a constant breezy stream of gags, quips and expertly choreographed action. Deadpool 2 is filthier, funnier and ferociously manic.",
        "The result isn't as novel as the original, or as effortlessly kinetic, but it is nevertheless a joke-packed action film that continues to deliver on the character's potential, while opening up the door to an even bigger series of sarcastic superhero adventures.",
        "Infinity War will likely be first choice for the summer season crowd, but Deadpool 2 wins hands down in terms of personal stakes and visual flair.",
        "This is the rare comedy sequel that doesn\u2019t just equal the original: it betters it, with bells and ball-sacks on.",
        "Right now, he's the perfect \"Avengers\" antidote.",
        "Deadpool 2 is, above all else, a lot of fun. (And yes, you must stay for the post-credit scenes.) Sometimes it maybe doesn\u2019t take itself seriously enough (after about the 50th crack you do kind of want to tell Reynolds to hold off for a minute). But in a genre that takes itself so deadly seriously, this is like a breath of fresh air.",
        "Funnier, filthier, and damn entertaining, Deadpool 2 leaves no stone un-deconstructed: the naughty man-child of the X-Men universe who manages to beat them at their own game.",
        "There's action aplenty throughout the film, but Deadpool 2 doesn't bog down in it as many overcooked comic-book sequels do. With Reynolds' charismatic irreverence at its core, the pic moves from bloody mayhem to lewd comedy and back fluidly, occasionally even making room to go warm and mushy.",
        "Despite the character\u2019s trademark flippancy, there\u2019s a real unexpected warmth to Deadpool 2. Not only does the sequel explore this flawed character, it firmly establishes him as a loveable and effective hero.",
        "The film\u2019s greatest asset is Reynolds, who in Deadpool finally found the role of his dreams. Reynolds totally sells the character\u2019s blend of reckless self-absorption and reluctant heroics.",
        "Here, Leitch uses brevity to do for witty action what it famously does for wit alone.",
        "The bottom line is that viewers who enjoyed Deadpool will almost certainly enjoy Deadpool 2, although perhaps not quite as much.",
        "After shooting lots of people and cutting lots of throats, Deadpool tries blowing himself up, something he probably should have done first. And with that, the movie shifts. Deadpool 2 becomes less violent and a lot funnier. It becomes a much better movie than the original \u201cDeadpool,\u201d not an action bloodbath with laughs, but a knowing spoof of the superhero genre.",
        "If you\u2019ve got comics-movie fatigue, with frequent fourth-wall breaks to point out lazy writing, blatant foreshadowing or heavy reliance on CGI for fight scenes, Deadpool 2 is here for you. That doesn\u2019t mean those things aren\u2019t there (they are) \u2014 but the eagerness of Deadpool to call out its own shortcomings earns this trash-talking franchise a lot of goodwill.",
        "Deadpool 2 is chock-full of all the cartoonish ultraviolence, meta commentary and pop-culture references you\u2019d expect. Where it surprises \u2014 and why it works so well \u2014 is how it balances an actually touching undercurrent alongside superhero subversiveness.",
        "Reynolds is once again at his arch and nihilist best here, while acting and jumping in so much facial prosthetics that it makes him look like he\u2019s inside melted cheese \u2014 or, as the first movie put it, an avocado that had relations with an older avocado.",
        "It\u2019s in Deadpool\u2019s DNA to channel the wild id of a 12-year-old boy \u2014 a very clever one who happens to love boobs, Enya, and blowing stuff up. Which is dizzy fun for a while, like eating Twinkies on a Gravitron. Eventually, though, it just wears you out.",
        "Deadpool 2 is just like \u201cDeadpool\u201d only more so. It\u2019s actually a fair bit better \u2014 funnier, more inventive than the 2016 smash...and more consistent in its chosen tone and style: ultraviolent screwball comedy.",
        "Like so many franchise-starting first films, \u201cDeadpool\u201d had to push through some necessary evils to get to the good stuff, fortunately, all that subversive goodness is on wild display in Deadpool 2, which delivers on the promise of the first film (and more).",
        "Does Deadpool 2 pick up its predecessor\u2019s baton and run off to new and exciting places? Not really. Is it as tasty as leftovers on the second day? Absolutely. Temper your expectations accordingly.",
        "Deadpool 2 gets by as simply on a par with \u201cDeadpool,\u201d an ultra-violent joked-up Energizer Bunny of a comic book movie with a fun supporting cast, dead-pan deaths and deadpan Deadpool jokes about those deaths.",
        "Deadpool 2 is at its best when it cheerfully doesn\u2019t give a shit. The more it cared, the less I did.",
        "Deadpool 2 is an overstuffed cinematic burrito of raunchy insults, dismembering violence and a \"no f#*ks given\" attitude that's ready to burst at any second, but somehow holds together bite after enjoyable bite.",
        "In almost every respect, this sequel is an improvement on its 2016 predecessor: Sharper, grosser, more narratively coherent and funnier overall, with a few welcome new additions. It\u2019s a film willing to throw everything \u2014 jokes, references, heads, blood, guts and even a little bit of vomit \u2014 against the wall, rarely concerned about how much of it sticks.",
        "It all boils down to one important fact: Reynolds gets these comics.",
        "It still works. Maybe not as well, since the element of shock and awe can\u2019t be put back into its bottle, but anyone who enjoyed Wilson\u2019s transformation into a bullet-hole-riddled leotard that can\u2019t shut up should have as much fun.",
        "Though bringing in a bona fide action-cheese aesthete like David Leitch (Atomic Blonde, John Wick) to direct counts as a minor coup, Deadpool 2\u2019s attempts to fight superhero fatigue with self-awareness and meta shock value can become exhausting. Indulgent and uneven, but in spots gruesomely funny, the new film badly lacks the basic momentum of the original\u2019s formulaic plot.",
        "Deadpool 2 is very good at what it does, which is flattering the audience into feeling like it\u2019s in on the joke. If you\u2019re a doubter, though, you may wonder if the joke\u2019s on us.",
        "Since Deadpool 2 shows no sign of wanting to rewrite a whole genre with its audacity, we might as well concede that it does the job it apparently wants to do with professionalism and flair, and that the faster we end this piece, the faster you can go on social media and complain about it.",
        "The original \u201cDeadpool\u201d caught lightning in a bottle. The sequel sparks only intermittently.",
        "The fight sequences aren\u2019t as good as director David Leitch\u2019s previous work like Atomic Blonde and the John Wick movies, but it\u2019s better than the standard superhero fare, with enough clever touches to keep things interesting.",
        "There is something ever so slightly dishonest about this character, something false about the boundaries drawn around his sadism and his rage. Deadpool 2 dabbles in ugliness and transgression, but takes no real creative risks.",
        "Perhaps it\u2019s the effort of introducing so many new characters that has sucked out the spontaneity from Deadpool: still, it\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be sorted for the likely next installments.",
        "The movie\u2019s other major weakness is its continued foregrounding of the white guys at the expense of the consciously inclusive cast around them.",
        "With its uncompromising commitment to gross-out injuries, nerdy pop culture in-jokes and inappropriate touching, Deadpool 2 was clearly made to cater to existing fans with every innuendo-filled moment (they should stay through the credits for some important story points that are very nearly thrown away).",
        "Deadpool 2 likes to situate itself as the subversive alternative to so many bloated X-Men films, with all their grave self-importance and bombastic action, but even more of this go-around resembles those movies than its predecessor, and if it reads to you as more than a bit hypocritical, just know you\u2019re hardly alone.",
        "In Deadpool 2, the manic antics fly fast, but the franchise loses its edge as wise-cracking antihero Deadpool goes dadcore, attempting to infuse standard-issue four-quadrant studio blockbuster beats into what was once a revolutionary R-rated premise.",
        "Rather than face its own moral incoherence, Deadpool 2 blinks.",
        "Deadpool 2 muddies the distinction between parodying comic-book-movie conventions and perfunctorily adhering to them.",
        "Never before have the demands of my inner man-child been so stirred, though, than while experiencing Deadpool 2, a movie that feels scribbled in pencil crayon, drenched in Jolt cola and coated with the dust of a thousand discarded bags of Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos.",
        "Not too far beneath the movie\u2019s superficial abrasiveness is a desperate desire to be loved, a puppyish determination that is both hard to resist and, eventually, difficult to endure.",
        "There\u2019s no other way to put this: Deadpool 2 is a regular, shmegular superhero movie, distinguished only by an obnoxiously unearned dose of \u201csee what I did there?!\u201d It\u2019s a drag.",
        "It\u2019s a long movie and when its star isn\u2019t on screen and cracking wise, the boundary-pushing shocks and endless self-references wear thin. Still, if you\u2019re the Deadpool fanatic who recently had Reynolds\u2019s name tattooed on his arse, you definitely won\u2019t be grumbling.",
        "We\u2019ve reached superhero saturation point, and Deadpool 2 is less a satire of that condition than a symptom of it. It has zero suspense \u2014 it\u2019s too hip, too meta, for suspense.",
        "It\u2019s overstuffed, and essentially empty."

With the pressure of making a movie better than the 2016 adaptation, i could tell they wanted to make it more everything than the first movie, and it most ways they did. The gore is kicked up a notch, the humor is on point, and i never got bored when watching this movie. The cast did a great job brining their characters to the big screen. Most especially domino, Zazi beetz does a great job playing the lucky badass all throughout the movie. Its great to see colossus and negasonic teenage warhead back but i feel like i could've seen a little more of her. But cable is in a league of his own. Josh brolin does an amazing job playing the badass super soldier. But the one thing this movie has a problem with is its mood and pacing, at some points it tries to be romantic but it just made me feel awkward watching this with my parents next to me. same thing with the pacing at times. But those are just small points that dont affect how i feel about this movie and i believe deadpool 2 was well worth the wait and was everything i wanted the movie to be and more. But is it better than the first? In my opinion it is in most ways, but i feel like their are more iconic scenes in the first deadpool than in the second. But no matter what i say, If you have the time, i highly recomend you watch this over the top \"family\" movie.",

And by being handsome. Mostly the handsome thing. It never won him much critical praise though until he started playing the character of Deadpool. Who, as the comics will tell you, is actually just Ryan Reynolds. So kudos to him for finally finding a way to make that work and getting that superhero franchise he's tried umpteen times for.Deadpool 2 is more of the same with tons of callbacks to the previous film. I kind of wish they would ditch the sentimentality and just go full on superhero farce already. The clich\u00e9 emotional stuff with Morena Baccarin is easily the least interesting part of the whole thing. The movie is at it's best when it's delivering more of the crude, irreverent humor and gleefully gratuitous violence of it's predecessor. Luckily, that's what it spends most of it's time doing.Nearly every bit of pop culture you could think of gets skewered here. Especially other superhero movies. Deadpool once again did a way better job of having the characters operate like the do in the comics than any of the main X-Men films ever have. Even to the point of fixing another tragically mishandled fan-favorite villain. It's also still very refreshing to experience a superhero film make such liberal use of gore, heavy profanity, and killing. Let's hope Disney and Marvel take some notes from what Fox was able to achieve by making R-rated cape and costume flicks now that they've recovered their long absent mutants. Oh, and that they keep Reynolds around.Deadpool 2 doesn't really take it's title character in any new directions or branch out from what the previous film did much at all. And it didn't really need to. The first Deadpool was such a breath of fresh air (even in spite of sticking close to origin story conventions) that a second helping feels like exactly what we needed. Especially since round two might actually be a bit funnier. Let's also not forget how it's one of the best Fox movies at doing the comics justice. Even the X-Men films I've really liked have managed to butcher a character in one way or another. Deadpool 2 gets them all right and limits it's use of the overexposed Wolverine to a few well-placed jokes.8.6/10",

Ryan's snarky commentary throughout is funny but it's uneven because he doesn't apply it to his love scenes with Vanessa (Morena B), but that's a minor nit that's certainly offset by so many other areas of strength. TJ Miller is always a comedic treat, just saw him in \"Ready Player One\" last night, too. And the character \"Domino\" made for some entertaining moments with her super ability of \"luck\".

This time Wade Wilson/Deadpool's character actually develops a bit more, thanks to his girlfriend Vanessa and the quest to save the fat kid.

With a noticeably higher budget, the multitude of action sequences are more absorbing than the first (as one could guess with the addition of David Leitch as director). Said action is balanced with an abundance of jokes and fourth-wall breaks, which are as strong as ever, and cement Ryan Reynolds as a comedic master. But what\u2019s more impressive is the ensemble surrounding him, which handles the balance between intensity and hilarity flawlessly. The villain in Cable is a near-perfect representation of the character, and Josh Brolin brings his A-game. Where the film faults, though, is its story, which is seemingly over-convoluted when compared to the genius simplicity of its predecessor. A lack of motivation for the events taking place on screen, besides the fact that they\u2019re funny as hell, is kind of frustrating, and the poor writing choices chosen for these setups serve as through away jokes (as referenced by the merc himself).

Marvel fans who liked the first one should see it, but do not bring your kids. The jokes are as raunchy as they come. That's not a fault... that is just Deadpool.",

And, I had aMy expectations for Deadpool 2 started out fairly modest because I wasn't sure if it could live up to how fun and unexpectedly good the first one was, but as more and more of my friends saw it my expectations started to rise. And, I had a great time watching it. I do think that the first one is better, but overall I think I may have enjoyed this one more. It's kind of weird. Story: The story of the Deadpool 2 is definitely more complex than the first one (although it does essentially boil down to \"Guy from future wants to kill kid, Deadpool no like that\"), and as a result I did find myself more invested in it than the first one. It seemed a bit more serious and the stakes did seem higher. It really is a paint by numbers superhero story, but it completely works for Deadpool 2 because you could almost look at it as part of the joke that is Deadpool. He likes to take shots at superhero stuff, but he happens to be in a movie that follows the standard superhero formula. A big thing that didn't work for me story wise, and a big reason why I think that the first one is a tiny bit better, is that the kid who Deadpool wants to protect is straight up not likable. I didn't like his character, wasn't super impressed by the kid portraying the character, and honestly was quite annoyed by him any time he was on screen.Humor: This is where it gets weird. I found Deadpool 2 to be funnier than Deadpool, but I feel like Deadpool 2 overcooks it a bit with the comedy. There was a point in the movie where it felt like it was just constantly pelting me with jokes, and not all of them landed. So while I found it incredibly funny overall, I think it could have benefited from toning down the number of jokes by just a smidge.Acting: Ryan Reynolds is Deadpool. That's all that really needs to be said. Overall: Deadpool 2 is a solid movie and a worthy sequel to Deadpool, although it may not be quite as good.",

Well\u201cI\u2019m Batman\u201d\u2018Deadpool 2\u2019 is a massive improvement over the first in terms of film making and having more freedom to go balls to the wall. Not feeling so contained. Having more laughs and soul in this serious drama about the \u2018F\u2019 word. Well that\u2019s what Deadpool thinks. A lot more ruthless when referencing other movies or other source materials surrounding this movie.Now my main issue from the first movie is how colorless and bland the film making was. Something lacking or anything stuck out as memorable in terms of visual comedy. This time it\u2019s directed by David Leitch, best known for John Wick and Atomic Blonde, who added a lot of his mystical tricks into this. How Leitch filmed the action scenes was slick and flowed smoothly. Especially in the musical numbers (played for comedy) that plays along during those sequences as a parody for blockbusters trying to be serious. Also not forgetting the truck chase.Ryan Reynolds returns as the mouth taking anti-hero, but more crude and plenty of fourth wall breaking to go around. It\u2019s clear from interviews and the behind the scenes that Reynolds is having an absolute blast playing this role. Probably the most fun he\u2019s ever had. Taking past failures into account for humor and doesn't waste time to erase them. Reynolds once again captures the character in spirit through his sharp line delivery and comedic timing. But also giving the character heart by showing a softer side, which stops him from being annoying.Josh Brolin is having such a great year it\u2019s unbelievable. First \u2018Infinity War\u2019, than this, and Sicario 2. I've never seen an actor who\u2019s been in three movies within three months back to back. His physical work and keeping up the straight man phase throughout also adds to the comedy. Never cracking a smile and keeping up the \u2018tough guy\u2019 appearance. He commands the scene whenever he appears on screen. Brolin delivers a great performance, what\u2019s new?While the achievements deserves it's praise, but please keep in mind it\u2019s not perfect by any mean, like a masterpiece level. It\u2019s freaking stupid if you ask me. Some of the CGI looked a bit noticeable and since there\u2019s a lot of jokes, not all land. While all the actors played the parts well, small or big, were excellent either way and have such great chemistry with each other. Unfortunately the same couldn't be said about T.J Miller who was one of the worst parts of the movie. The running gag of \u201cYou look like an avocado had sex-\u201d or \u201cyou look like Freddy Krueger **** a topographical map\u201d was never funny in the first place. Glad he\u2019s screen time was short. I really hope they kill his character off in the next one, which seems more possibly if you heard the recent news surrounding the actor. Or knowledge his absence.Other than that, Deadpool 2 is an extremely enjoyable film that succeeds and falls short in certain areas. If you like the first, then you will or probably have enjoyed this. For me, I was laughing and smiling for 2 hours.Overall rating: Zazie Beetz and Rob Delaney are national treasures.",

Of course if that isn't your cup of tea, there's always tons of action to come along with the humor (because it's Marvel).

Deadpool 2 has a pretty rocky start, the first 20 minutes were straight up hard to enjoy and made me worried for the rest of the film. After the first act the real plot kicks in and things get into a really good groove. This sequel is not as fresh or in a sense special as the original Deadpool was, but it made up for it in its wonderful action set-pieces and the addition of some pretty great new characters (Cable, Domino and Peter) with the glorious return of Colossus. So all in all I'd say that Deadpool 2 has the same good and bad qualities of its predecessor (fun as balls with humour that's equally hilarious as it is forced wrapped in a pretty conventional plot), but DP 2 has a more interesting story and overall I'd say it's more rewatchable.

During some events in the future, a person killed the familly of a militar, and for get them back, he decides to go back in time and killed that person while is still a kid, and that crosses the deadpool way. Directed by David Leitch.The story of this movie does have some really up moments and some really up down ones. Right at the very beginning one thing is going on, and that thing leads to one big deal that happens, and this happening feels so dislocated of the whole plot of the movie that it is disturbing, and they keeped bringing that back apparently having not to do with the plot, but at the very end that makes sense and it is important, i like to think in this story as two circles, one around the other that first seems to be completely disconnected but in the end of the circle the find eachother, it is good. The other circle would be the Cable one, his motivation wasn't bad, but still there was some moments that didn't felt right, like somethings that was kind of out of place, some things that he did during his journey that aren't really a thing that made sense, but considering that the movie makes joke about everything, incluiding itself, it get a free pass and doesn't bother much. The tone and narrative change from times, but not all of the moments are organic, some felt just threaded there. The chemistry between the characters in some moments works in others not that much.The comedy in this movie gets fantastic, it started slow, with some common lines, but as the keep goes, the comedy start getting another level, there are a few ways that the movie try to get you to laugh, wich is lines, actions that break the expectation and some really not convenient moments. All of these work ? No, but generally made me laugh the hell out of me in some moments, there are some big things that they did just to make a giant joke, and that killed me completely, was really funny, there at least two moments that i got broke of how much i did laugh. There are some lines that are good, but there are some that just don't work, wich is normal, there are those simple fart jokes, wich i don't find them funny anymore, was so much used in so many different ways, for me that is exhausted already. There are jokes that got repeated from the first one, but most of them get to a new level and can still be fun, jokes with Ryan or with Fox for example, worked out very well for me. The movie also is a machine gun of references, it does reference so many things, musics, movies, events, most of the time it is very cool. The break of the fourth wall is a big differential, always that he spoke to us, it was a nice moment.Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool one more time, just proved why he is the perfect one for this role, his voice and comical time are perfect, he convinced me in his physicality and also in the personality, in the dramatic moments he didn't convinced me perfectly, but i can't say that it was bad, surely wasn't as good as the comic ones, but it was functional. Josh Brolin was badass, his dramatic moments wasn't the best of the history, his character didn't seemed to have much expressions, it was pretty simple, he worked more as a ladder for deadpool and for the plot to flow, but in the action moments he was great. Zazie Beetz as Domino was pretty cool, she didn't had much challenge in the acting, i believe, but she fit well in that role. Morena Baccarin have a small role here, but she convinced me in the romantic parts, you could see that she was kind and full of love, really good.The action here can be dope and at the same time hilarious. It was pretty fun, the choreography of fight wasn't insane, but it was good, there are some sequences with swords and shots that are really nice to see. The powers of Cable were well demonstrated and it was badass. There is one specific moment that the characters used their powers togheter to beat a villain, wich was dope. The way that they show Domino's powers was great, they didn't just said that she was luck and showed a lucky moment, the showed the whole process to make the ending to be that lucky one, also pretty damn cool.The soundtrack was good, it had some uses of already known songs, in some moments that worked really well, in some not that much, but in general it was different, wich is always nice.The cgi was better than the first one, but not by far perfect, it had some moments that wasn't really that good, but generally it also worked out very well.The movie have some switches between drama and comedy that doesn't work everytime, but singularly they both deliver some good moments. The comedy is very nice in general, so as the action.",

This second installment in the sarcastic loud-mouthed superhero\u2019s series is a bit of a surprise, since sequels rarely conjure up the same passion and fandom as the original film. Much like 22 Jump Street, Deadpool 2 succeeds in its self-awareness. Multiple self-deprecating jokes about lazy writing and some surprisingly bold decisions with regard to the story make this sequel, in some ways, more memorable, and certainly more unique in its genre, than the original. Deadpool is a standard superhero film with some R-rated humor baked into its crust whereas Deadpool 2 is a superhero film distancing itself from the formula. Without this distinction, Deadpool 2 would not be worth two hours of anyone\u2019s time.Little can be discussed with regard to the story without leading to spoilers (not that a film of this nature demands or deserves much analysis). Many of the jokes will not age well, and audiences may soon tire of Ryan Reynolds\u2019s brand of humor in general. While I am certain that I left the theater the same person as before I walked in and had zero of my core beliefs or ideas challenged, I am not sure if I have been more entertained on a base level this year.",

Deadpool 2 most definitely stands outIt's no secret that the film industry today is bursting at the seams with superhero movies. It's a crowded genre, and it's becoming very difficult to find one that stands out and breaks free of clich\u00e9s. Deadpool 2 most definitely stands out and provided many pleasant surprises, but there are just some tropes that it can't overcome.But that's not to say that it's without originality. The story takes many unanticipated turns that completely defy expectations. It takes quite some time to reveal the true nature of the plot, and that's something that's difficult to achieve and is commendable here. However, once everything is understood at the end of act two, the third act plays out pretty much exactly how one would expect it to. There's nothing compelling about it. The conclusion is very generic, which is disappointing when it's considered that there's a decent amount of unconventional material present in the rest of the film.Deadpool as a character gets an entirely different side shown to him in this sequel, and that's one of the fresh things about the movie. The merc with a mouth exposes his darker side and actually becomes a much deeper character as a result. Unfortunately, the rest of the characters are comparatively poorly written and hardly develop at all.Serious stuff aside, though, the gleeful violence and unhinged humor definitely serve their purpose here. Not all of the jokes hit as hard as they should, but the fourth-wall-breaking script pokes plenty of fun at its own flaws and it makes for a fun ride!Deadpool 2 isn't a film that's particularly memorable; the overall package is one that ends on a note that leaves it blending in with other movies in the genre. But it's an incredibly entertaining, action-packed, and hilarious thrill that is definitely worth seeing, preferably with some friends.Story: 7Acting: 7.5Script: 7Visuals/Sound: 8Entertainment Value: 8OVERALL SCORE: 7.5/10",

Reynolds holds the fort with his on-point portrayal of every fanboy's favourite off the curve comic book hero with a wry, unceasing wit and the explosive energy of a man constantly jacked up on speed. The action is pretty consistent although there are a few dips into the soppier stuff here and there because....the audience has feelings(yawn)! All said, the pace and is excellent and there's more than enough to hold your attention throughout. As a cast, there are some very familiar faces as well as some choice cameos from Hollywoods finest. Josh Brolin is fantastic as the big baddie Cable, Zazie Beetz as Domino does some serious scene-stealing and the film's youngest star, Julian Dennison brilliantly portrays the angst-ridden teenager Russell. On the negative side, I thought the X-men were given too significant a role and took away rather than added to the story. The characters are quite bland and all the humour centred around them had been exhausted the first time around. Some of the VFX could have been better, notably Colossus and Juggernaut. They never looked convincing, and the animation was distractingly stilted at times. Many of the jokes centred around Colussus, in particular, didn't land. All in all pretty minor quibbles in what is otherwise a very satisfying venture with plenty of laughs and gory action.",

With the first one setting the bar very high there was always the fear that it would slowly decrease in quality with each sequel until there\u2019s no more money to be made and the franchise dies. Deadpool 2 could have been a disaster but with Ryan Reynolds and director David Leitch in control there was no need to worry. I loved every minute of Deadpool 2, from the crude jokes to the ultra violent action sequences. Sure I could have done without a slow-motion scene every five minutes but I\u2019m willing to forgive that. Fun and entertaining to the max. The addition of some new characters was a definite step in the right direction particularly, Zazie Beetz as Domino and Josh Brolin, who is having a great year. I hope I don\u2019t have to sell this movie to you, the marketing alone should have done that, if you enjoyed the first Deadpool then get yourselves to a cinema and check out Deadpool 2, not only does it not disappoint but it\u2019s just as good as the first one.

Deadpool is a series that doesn't take itself too seriously and that is never more apparent than at the end scenes were some humorous course correction takes place. Deadpool doesn't set out to tell a large, detailed story but mostly tells a story of an anti-hero who is just making it up as he goes. The breaking of the 4th wall is still Deadpool's signature selling point and he uses it to perfection in this movie. Highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good laugh and good action.",

The new character Domino is great.  The opening credits are a wonderful homage to the Bond films.  The story is a little predictable and somewhat schmaltzy.  There is a scene  near the end where there is a snarky (albeit funny) comment about the conventions of these movies, then the movie simply follows the convention.

The trailers showed X-Force but I'll just say they were a scam as big as Ben Kingsley playing The Mandarin, while Colossus, Negasonic and Dopinder repeat their same supporting roles.The action is 10 times bigger and better than its predecessor but the CGI at times looks very bad, but definitively Deadpool 2 has better moments than the shooting on the highway of the first film, yet surprisingly, the final battle felt quite anticlimactic.In summary Deadpool 2 is more of the same only than on a larger scale and that was disappointing.It's still fun but the same joke doesn't work the same way twice.If you loved the first one, you will love this one, but if you expected something more like me, Deadpool 2 was far from offering it.By the way there is indeed a scene in the credits and it was quite worth it.

The first had modest action - here the amount, scale and choreography (thanks to director Devit Leitch) of fight scenes is heightened noticeably. The situation with jokes here is on par with the original - there are a lot of them, some don't work, but many do and the overall impression is very much favorable, there are plenty of laughs to be had here. The sheer number of characters involved is also increased, which does leave some with little screen time, like Negasonic Warhead.Had it not been for the stretched-out ending and a few story hiccups, this might've even been a 10/10 contender.

Indeed, like the film's titular protagonist, \"Deadpool 2\" is as irreverent, violent, and as hilarious as ever, with the improved action set pieces and additions to the cast embodying the highest marks I can give the film. And though the plot may not really be as simple and clean-cut as I was hoping, there's enough smile-worthy gags and eye-popping kills to keep me wanting even more.",

This film really kicks up the violence, fun, and fourth wall-breaking quite a few notches and adds some fun and awesome characters into the mix, such as Josh Brolin's Cable, Zazie Beetz's Domino, and even some rather unexpected blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameos in a couple spots. Reynolds is once again spot-on and fully committed to the role he was born to play, which is especially made evident and credible in the hilarious mid-credit scenes! Overall, I really couldn't have asked for a better sequel to an already hilarious and enjoyable first film! Keep doing what you're doing Mr. Reynolds!",
