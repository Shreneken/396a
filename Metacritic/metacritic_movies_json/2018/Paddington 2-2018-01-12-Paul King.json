    "summary": "Paddington, now happily settled with the Brown family and a popular member of the local community, picks up a series of odd jobs to buy the perfect present for his Aunt Lucy's 100th birthday, only for the gift to be stolen.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "It's an exquisite reminder of the wondrous things that can happen when a storyteller of boundless imagination avails himself of some rigorous discipline.",
        "This bearish sequel will leave you with a heart so warmed, you could trek across the Antarctic in shorts.",
        "Mr. King and his excellent team of actors and animators spin good writing and seamless digital effects into Rococo children\u2019s entertainment. The gags don\u2019t accumulate; they tessellate.",
        "Aside from being a disarming, refreshing wallow in kindness, Paddington 2 also has the benefit of being well-constructed and exceedingly well-performed.",
        "It\u2019s a family adventure that\u2019s the right sort of heartwarming, delivering real human emotion through the medium of a small bear.",
        "An exemplary sequel, the film retains the innocence and beguiling lack of cynicism of the first film, but moves on to explore other motifs",
        "Paddington 2 is every bit as enchanting as the first, perhaps even more so, but it feels arbitrary to pick a winner. The film is a pure delight, as sweet and sharp as, well, marmalade, really.",
        "It\u2019s beyond playful. Wonderful and whimsical, for that matter. Fun to look at and completely immersive. It\u2019s hilarious, heartfelt, and humane, as well. It\u2019s even a tad sagely in its universally appealing lessons of manners, sympathy, and open-mindedness.",
        "A delightfully heartwarming tale about everyone\u2019s favorite marmalade-loving bear.",
        "The film never loses its spirit of harmony, even during its lengthy railroad chase ending. Throughout, it is a marvel of humor, dazzling visuals, and unique characters.",
        "Paddington\u2019s ability to positively impact people is so profound that it can\u2019t help but stretch out towards the audience, too. We may know that being kind and polite doesn\u2019t always set the world right, but damn if that little bear doesn\u2019t make you want to try.",
        "Paddington 2 is \u201cThe Godfather Part II\u201d of Peruvian bear movies, a sequel that surpasses the superb original.",
        "The film gets progressively funnier and more delightful as it goes on; King layers plenty of good-natured comedy on top of each daring escape and chase scene, stretching probability and sometimes patience near the end, but each new hitch and escape feels like an act of invention.",
        "Paddington 2 is another near-pawfect family entertainment, honoring the cozy, can-do spirit of Bond\u2019s stories while bringing them smoothly into a bustling, diverse 21st-century London \u2014 with space for some light anti-Brexit subtext to boot.",
        "Paddington 2 is a sure-footed, sweet-natured family comedy which isn\u2019t set at Christmas, but which glows with so much warmth and fun that it might well be a staple of festive television for years to come.",
        "Every bit as perfectly tuned, cruelty-free funny and kind-hearted as its predecessor, maybe even more so.",
        "As sequels go, Paddington 2 is up to the challenge. It\u2019s neck and neck, or paw and claw as to which is the better, so why not just watch both back to back?",
        "It\u2019s a perfect flick for families, but also a jolly time for anyone with a pulse.",
        "Turns out to be every bit as deft, witty and, yes, moving as the first one.",
        "A wilder, weirder, funnier, more heartfelt and eye-popping, and, above all, more fully realized representation of director Paul King\u2019s eccentric sensibility.",
        "A charmer from its first action-packed frames to its over-the-top jailhouse-musical scene during the end credits.",
        "I love the light, intensely likable lilt Whishaw (\u201cQ\u201d in the latest James Bond films) gives Paddington\u2019s line-readings. You forget the bear is animated and that bears can\u2019t talk, and your children won\u2019t even need that much encouragement to suspend disbelief.",
        "Paddington 2 goes all in on the charm and wit established in the first film and comes up with yet another winner.",
        "Paddington 2 reminds us how difficult it can be to pull off a sweetly tempered, gently moving children\u2019s movie by doing exactly that, and doing it so well.",
        "Paul King\u2018s marvellously rousing, deeply satisfying sequel \u2014 is not only another warm, friendly, massively good-natured family-friendly film, but it\u2019s deeply caring, here to give everyone a light and entertaining diversion during these taxing times.",
        "Paddington 2 is a winsome confection. More than just a movie, it\u2019s a necessary mood corrective, a temporary escape hatch from negativity. The world does indeed feel right in the company of this kind and polite little bear.",
        "Paddington 2 is gorgeous to look at, smartly written, and gleefully funny, boasting a fierce ensemble of estimable British thespians. For those looking specifically for excellent family entertainment, it\u2019s a must-see; but even other viewers will find this movie well worth their time.",
        "Most fruitful of all is the husbandry of the gags, some of which are planted early in the film and must wait for more than an hour before they bloom.",
        "Paddington was uncommonly charming and Paddington 2 is very nearly as good.",
        "The film is pitched with insouciant ease and a lightness of touch at both children and adults without any self-conscious shifts in irony or tone: it\u2019s humour with the citrus tang of top-quality thick-cut marmalade.",
        "The first Paddington was a joyful and somewhat unexpected treat, and the sequel is no different.",
        "A feel good sequel only marmalade haters could resist.",
        "Paddington 2 is a charming early-year offering and, although the main character is better known in the U.K. than the U.S., no cultural leap is required to fall in love with the bear and enjoy his adventures.",
        "This Paddington, so sweetly voiced by Ben Whishaw, is just ursine enough on the one hand and just teddy enough on the other to reproduce the charm of the original.",
        "Paddington 2 proves the smart-but-sweet combination that marked the first live-action film was no fluke.",
        "The sequel has the same tone as the original but is livelier and funnier, mostly due to Hugh Grant, who gleams as the bad guy.",
        "Hawkins, Bonneville and voice actor Ben Whishaw \u2014 who makes Paddington sound like the Geico gecko minus the attitude \u2014 give the film a strong base of kindness.",
        "Though the formulaic treasure-hunting plot sometimes gets out of hand, it doesn\u2019t muddle the intended message."

            "content": "Possibly the best movie sequel of a family live-action pic in a long, long time.  First of all, the new installment inserts, in my opinion, a female predominance that is a little synthetic, forced and purposeful to the issues of today's womenPossibly the best movie sequel of a family live-action pic in a long, long time.  First of all, the new installment inserts, in my opinion, a female predominance that is a little synthetic, forced and purposeful to the issues of today's women and men equality. In the opening scene, it's not papa bear who executes dangerous feats, it's Aunt Lucy, who proves to have enough guts, up to there a generous honor, however, all female sub-plots in the Brown family become erroneously comic: swimming an entire ocean or writing a men-free newspaper? Really? Fortunately, the excessive female empowerment ceases from there, and perhaps it'd have worked better if this cool load had been distributed throughout the film, the saturation of the onset didn't help at all. Moreover, the script is not exempt from showing stereotyped and traditional versions and failed comedy moments, but, they're, luckily, limited, opening the way to the eccentricities that enable it to be a family film, probably, belonging to the best of the best of the new century.As most of the supporting plots lack a solid and credible identity, writers Simon Farnaby and Paul King opt to deposit all their narrative inventiveness in the protagonist's central plot, since, in the end, it's he who must be under the spotlight, of course, an action made possible by a three-dimensional antagonist. Hugh Grant stands in for the main role in the scenes where the bear is missing, because this villain, a funny character and peculiar enough not to surpass the barrier of the absurd, makes possible the gratifying amount of comedy situations and justifies, eloquently, the progress of the story and its corresponding junctures. The acting power not only lies on the antagonist's shoulders, we also receive charming and juicy interpretations from actors such as Peter Capaldi and Sally Hawkins, creating a dynamic pace and a fluid connection with the audience. It's important to dedicate a whole paragraph to the unexpected humor of the feature film because supported by elements previously mentioned such as cast or artistic inventiveness, it manages to be one of the best shaped, most virtuous and functional comedies of recent times. It's known that within the feasible \"Paddington\" movie franchise, the comic factor rests mostly upon the shoulders of the dewy-eyed bear, because of this we see how, amusingly, different jobs pop up through the life of the animal. With all the different variables and combinations for comedy genre, the film chooses to put one more physical and boisterous in scenes where the nice protagonist is usually the architect, in the same way, it's evident a dynamic and sincere collective charm that always derives from the interaction between the characters and the leading role. Likewise, the screenwriters are perceptive enough to interweave every funny moment with subsequent situations, in other words, the characters or actions, they perform without intent, are generally part of a humorous range bigger than the achieved with a single scene, a better result. On this occasion, the vivid colors, an innate feature of the first film, return, however, it differs, radically, because they don't end up being cloying, Erik Wilson knows how to endow a film focused on a defined-personality animal, clearly, supported by a source of inspiration, however, this doesn't devitalize the enchantment and strength of a world that makes speeches through the visual landscapes with aplomb about hope and union. A major achievement is the artistic section of the work, it's dazzling and laborious the way in which they avoid ridicule moves even having pink-dressed prisoners, a family with extravagant garments or a metropolis with serious wrapping but colorful content; every little feature is visually coherent as a whole, a polychromatic whole. It's a huge victory for family comedies. Added to the handsome cinematography, it seems incalculable the number of special effects responsible who took an active part in the film, however, based on their work on specific scenes, it's possible to give approximations with full conviction. No wonder, Paul King's \"Paddington 2\" returns to the top, materializing splendid visual wills and proposing important teachings, operations that allow it to be a compelling film for general audiences; A creative and deep-felt comedy that means a real event because it vindicates the poor quality of the most recent family flicks. As a motion picture, it borders on the critical perfection and commercially  has become a moderate hit, however, the true victory of King's movie is to conceive one of the best cinematic adventures about love, family and, could not miss the peculiarities of a charismatic kind-hearted bear; creatively surprising and narratively dynamic, we welcome a feature film that is truly worth paying for, without noticing its smell of marmalade.",

Not only are they pure and innocent and genuinely sweet and charming, but everyone put all the care in the world with making them. From Paul King's excellent direction that not only is full of energy (there is no slow moments in the film), but also having a ton of interesting shot composition too, to the fantastic cast, with Hugh Bonneville, Sally Fields, and Jim Broadbent returning to the cast and bringing their magic and enthusiasm to the films, and of course Ben Whishaw's warmth and tenderness as the voice to the titular bear, and with the new editions of Hugh Grant and Brendan Gleeson sharing scene stealing roles, to just the writing alone teaching fantastic life lessons to younger viewers and giving older audiences not just genuine laughs but a wonderful story that gives everyone with an open heart warmth and joy. There is no cynical bone in the film's body that usually ruin kids films like this. It's just a fantastic feel good film that is well made as a movie overall! I mean the set design, art direction, and even the coloring is top notch!Sadly, there is one major flaw with the film, the CGI. This is a complaint with the last Paddington film, because while the design of Paddington is great and there are a ton of characteristics and movements that are indeed spot on, the integration just isn't the best and often feel too unrealistic. It is not a deal-breaker as the movie is still a lot of fun regardless, but still it is a shame. Also there is a bad green-screen effect that is painfully obvious during the third act.Regardless, this is a must see for all ages!",

It could have been 'great' but it was merely 'good' due to two unrealistic scenes in the end that let it down for me.Related media: I have not read any of the children books, but I have seen the first film. I had only given it a 3/5. Please check out my review of it.What's it like?: Paddington the bear finds a wonderful pop-up book in a shop and he wants to earn the money to buy it and then send it to his aunt, but the villain wants the book too!Pros: 1) The first film appealed more to children, while this film has better acting and a more realistic plot and it has a broader appeal. Adults would enjoy this more than the first film.2) Hugh Grant had a great opportunity to display his diverse acting skills as the villain here and he did not disappoint.Cons: Everything was going well and I would have awarded the film 5/5, and then it had to show two highly unrealistic scenes towards the end!How would the the different age groups rate it?Children: ExcellentTeens: ExcellentYoung adults: GoodMedium age adults: GoodOld adults: GoodRating: 4/5 (no half scores). It's worthwhile to pay to watch it in the cinema.",

I decided to see this sequel because of the strong reviews. It follows the little bear who lives in London with his human family, as he takes on odd jobs to buy a special present. Unfortunately, a pompous actor (Hugh Grant relishing the opportunity to chew the scenery) becomes the villain and takes the story in a dark direction. The film unfolds with a chipper attitude and a cast of top English talent. There are flights of fantasy and a sweet earnestness that makes it appealing. It's not an exceptional movie (damn reviewers), but it's likable charms will appeal to family audiences looking for a traditional, subdued approach to children's stories.",

And the most important of it all, that I used to be amazed about was how in the final act of the movie everything helps the lead character and by 'everything' I mean in every situation; however troublesome it was, it just worked. Paddington is definitely all of this and more to it whether it be then intense situations or deep characters or sketchy bad guys and with a soul in it which let's be frank is hard to find. Even though Paddington's first act is plotting characters and tracks, the key is they do it with a great conviction for it to not look like repetition or become a slog or suspicious for that matter. Hugh Bonneville is flat out funny and surprisingly so is Hugh Grant even though he is the bad guy. But Sally Hawkins is the bridge here that bonds this peculiar world to reality as her screen presence is soothing. Paddington is smart, well detailed and to the point and if there had not been any flaws; it would have been perfect.",

That soft butter melting voice and great British charm. Even during his comedic mess ups, you can't get mad or annoyed at him. It's utterly delightful.Only Paul King can make this work. 'Paddington 2' lives up to the hype and doesn't suffer from sequel curse. I'm not trying to over hype it, but it's right up there with 'The Dark Knight' and 'T2: Judgement Day'. Stepping away from being just a kids movie, because how this movie is directed and shot I would put on the same level of iconic directors.You can see the influences of Wes Anderson with the framing, cartoonist colors, and comedic timing of every joke - Like an old fashion sense of humor. Even Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin can thrown into the mix in terms of chaotic scenes.The cast are stellar. My complaint from the first film about the family characters not being that interesting, well that's changed here. Sally Hawkins, Hugh Bonneville, Brendan Gleeson, and Julie Walters were fantastic in this. I hope Hawkins (Mrs. Brown) gets her spin-off detective film.Hugh Grant, on the other hand, is the show stealer here. He was freaking brilliant and makes one memorable villain. The different personalties he takes on to out smart everyone and you can truly see how, just how convincing it is. Paddington 1 & 2 have such complex villains.My only complaint isn't with the film itself, but Ben Whishaw doesn't like marmalade in real life",

The comedy is still pretty great but in some scenes you could see that the actors were literally acting in front of the void and it felt pretty awkward. The villain had more screen time  than the previous one and I mostly enjoyed the way he did everything with such high energy. Definitely a must watch but you do need to watch the first movie to get a better understanding of the characters.",

Wait, a payoff? That is right, in thisWith Paddington finally safe with the Browns in harmony after dealing with the diabolical Millicent Bystander, I mean just Millicent...the bear cub is back with an unanticipated payoff in a sequel. Wait, a payoff? That is right, in this glorious family film that strikes again with a vengeance. When I said the first film was like Paddington being on his own for the first time, just like a fresh high school grad goes off to college or moves into his or her own house, this one shows a secondary function when certain unexpected dilemmas can clash into you and have to think fast to get yourself out of it. Paddington works until he loses his fur to pay for a surprise book that he wants to give to his aunt for her one hundredth lap lap around the sun. He becomes treated in the opposite way of the first film: a jailed hero when mistakenly accused. There is great satire in this movie when it becomes stylized in the same way as the films acclaimed films One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest and The Shawshank Redemption when there is motivation involved to inmates. Most movies do not always result the way as planned, but there is always maximum effort shown by the characters.\tI do not only see Paddington 2 as a rare sequel that is better than its predecessor, but I see it as a film that makes the characters revitalize their self-identities and hope, even if a coincidence is likely to ensue.",
