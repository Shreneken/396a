        "The movie, while giddily entertaining and exciting in fits and starts, fails to coalesce into a satisfying whole.",
        "D\u2019Souza seems too distracted by pyrotechnics to focus on getting believable performances from his cast. By presenting every lengthy fight scene in ultra-slow motion, he needlinessly draws out the film to an endless, nearly three-hour run time."
