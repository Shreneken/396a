  "critic_reviews": [
    "Just as it lulls you, it also devastates.",
    "It’s in theory the worst family movie of 2018 — and in practice one of the year’s best films.",
    "Tolstoy got it wrong and Shoplifters gets it right. All happy families are not the same. Hirokazu Kore-eda’s enchanting, subversive masterpiece takes on family values and bourgeois pieties through a Japanese crime family that is not what it seems.",
    "For the bulk of Shoplifters, Kore-eda works in a beautiful register that feels both detailed and genuine at the same time. We get to know these characters so deeply, watching them all at their jobs.",
    "In the past, Kore-eda’s delicacy has at times enervated his movies. Here, though, the family’s toughness, thieving and secrets, its poverty and desperation, work like ballast on his sensibilities. In their grubby imperfections, Kore-eda finds a perfect story about being human.",
    "This wise and insightful film is delicate, poignant and unexpectedly powerful.",
    "For all its gentle groundedness, a quality that suffuses much of Kore-eda’s work, Shoplifters strenuously resists romanticizing its main characters. Its compassion is more convincing for it. So is its brilliance.",
    "Master director Hirokazu Kore-eda, whose work won the Palm d’Or at Cannes this year, doesn’t pour on the emotion. He doesn’t need to – his film, even as it enchants, is quietly devastating.",
    "The director, though, reaches in and steals your heart right in front of your eyes, like a magic trick, and you have to admit you didn’t even see it coming.",
    "Every scene adds another onion-skinlike layer, adding density and mass so slowly that you hardly notice the emotional weight of it all until it is suddenly overwhelming.",
    "A tender ensemble piece whose skillful performances dovetail into a perfectly symphonic whole, Shoplifters is a work of such emotional delicacy and formal modesty that you're barely prepared when the full force of what it's doing suddenly knocks you sideways.",
    "Some of the credit must go to the stellar casting and performances. It’s difficult to single out one of the six actors in this alternative family unit as it’s a true ensemble display. But Kore-eda’s deft command of tone is a key factor too.",
    "At once charming and heart-wrenching, this exquisitely performed film will steal the hearts of both art-house and mainstream audiences.",
    "A quietly devastating portrayal of family and theft in contemporary Japan.",
    "It is a movie made up of delicate brushstrokes: details, moments, looks and smiles.",
    "Shoplifters is compassionate, socially conscious filmmaking with a piercing intelligence that is pure Kore-eda. This is a film that steals in and snatches your heart.",
    "The final act of Shoplifters, like all of Kore-eda’s best work, is devastating. After seeing the director tease out every strange bond in this makeshift group, investing his audience fully in their future, one finds it that much harder to watch when things fall apart.",
    "Kore-eda is working up to something else, steering the story he’s built so carefully toward an utterly unexpected detour. As much of what we think we know unravels, the film becomes not just an enjoyable, intermittently poignant portrait of imperfect people but a profound meditation on the meaning of family.",
    "A master of threading the needle between conflict and contrivance, Kore-eda manages to turn this drama inside out without every betraying its most resonant truth.",
    "It’s impossible to experience the deep-seated compassion of this film and not be moved to tears.",
    "This small film is a thoughtful addition to his parables about happy and unhappy families (Nobody Knows, After the Storm), studded with memorable characters and believable performances that quietly lead the viewer to reflect on societal values.",
    "Yet in many ways Shoplifters is an unlikely yet organic extension of his last film, 2017's crime drama \"The Third Murder.\" Less a whodunit than a whydidyoudoit, that legal procedural was really a subtle assault on Japan's judicial system, in which it's more important that a case makes sense than it reaches the truth. Shoplifters cuts close to the same marrow as \"The Third Murder,\" but with how Japan views families as his subject.",
    "Shoplifters is held up by the strength of its ensemble and Kore-eda’s gifts as a storyteller, which gain with every movie he makes—even in the same year.",
    "Like Kore-eda’s previous masterpiece, \"Like Father Like Son,\" the movie uses a domestic drama to illustrate larger and more compelling concerns about society in general.",
    "Shoplifters definitely goes after your heartstrings, yet especially after some third-act revelations put this family in a larger social context, the movie earns any tears it gets.",
    "Shoplifters, winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes, is a film acted with great sensitivity, a rough story delicately told.",
    "In Shoplifters, Kore-eda dramatizes the insidious and relativistic ordinariness of poverty.",
    "Not only does Shoplifters skillfully entwine several disparate threads he’s explored over his prolific career, it does so with the understated confidence and patient elegance of an artist who has fully matured.",
    "Kore-eda’s slow reveal of who these people are, and what they mean to each other, has its mystery story aspects, but this is essentially a character study, or at least it tries to be, and not a puzzle picture. He fills in each of the main players leisurely, in snatches.",
    "It’s moving stuff, even if Kore-eda threatens to dilute his themes by overindulging in them. Shoplifters overstays its welcome somewhat as the third act rolls on, with an epilogue that seems to exist only to absolve characters that don’t quite deserve it. The empathy is admirable, but one wishes for a touch more restraint, especially in the wake of such an emotionally devastating climax.",
    "What these people have in common beyond a shared surname really pounds the film’s theme home with a sledgehammer, but there are numerous tender, affecting moments en route to the finale’s tearjerker overdrive, many of them productively tangential to the overarching idea of choosing one’s own family.",
    "Trying to pick apart his native country’s struggles between tradition and modernity, legality and crime, Kore-eda takes the time to affectionately dissect the way family functions, before carefully deconstructing it and revealing the contoured complexities that live within.",
    "It’s an eerily moving piece, masterfully blurring the divide between the unforgivable and understandable, finding tenderness in the bleakest and most traumatic of circumstances.",
    "The spirits of the old masters pervade this disquieting but deeply moving drama. But Kore-eda stands alone as the chronicler of family life in a country facing an identity crisis.",
    "What Kore-eda wants to convey to his audience is that good and bad are never absolute, and that good and bad themselves have a reality above and beyond that of man-made laws.",
    "The secrets unveiled in the movie’s second half are mostly wretched, and Kore-eda, in his steady and unhectoring way, is levelling grave accusations at Japanese social norms, yet what stays with you, unforgettably, is that bundle of mixed souls at the start.",
    "Boasting excellent performances all round (with the writer-director once again demonstrating his expertise with children), Shoplifters is another charming, funny and very affecting example of Kore-eda’s special brand of tough-but-tender humanism.",
    "With its air of intimacy and fractious affections, Shoplifters feels like “The Borrowers” by way of Yasujiro Ozu, a discreetly observed drama about resourcefulness, loyalty and resilience in an era of obscene income inequality and a fatally frayed civic safety net.",
    "A slow but captivating burn that may leave you questioning your own hard-set ideas of right, wrong and family.",
    "By drawing our empathy for such morally dubious and potentially damaging characters, Shoplifters remains a real heartbreaker, the kind of which only this director seems capable."

Finalement, on se demande si on se fout de nous, s'il s'agit d'une simple comédie sociale faite à la va-vite, d'un drame pleurnichard qui ne savait pas où il allait ou le résultat d'une incompétence généralisée...D'autant que les deux heures sont clairement de trop, alourdissant énormément le propos et le drame familial par sa lenteur abrutissante...

      "content": "Shoplifters by Hirokazu Koreeda is one of the most beautiful portraits of the family household and its elements ever graced on-screen, and yes, that is how I am starting this review. While the last little while has been an array of firsts,Shoplifters by Hirokazu Koreeda is one of the most beautiful portraits of the family household and its elements ever graced on-screen, and yes, that is how I am starting this review. While the last little while has been an array of firsts, experiencing a Koreeda film, I found myself recalling immortal auteurs like Yasujiro Ozu with his “seasons” series of melodramas, chiefly revolving around domestic trials and tribulations of man and humanity itself. At times I found it played like a Vittorio De Sica film, sprawling with driven poverty and poetic synthesis, proving on being a companion piece to his infamous Bicycle Thieves. While this film is already in the company of great films, winning the Palme D’Or at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, Shoplifters is absolutely spellbinding! It’s a film that is reviving the idea that modern cinema can move and transcend audiences in the most simplistic and organic of settings and motions. In my humblest and sincerest personal opinion, classic French, Italian and Japanese cinema produces truly spiritual, dreamlike cinematic material. Works from these countries articulate family, love, and spirituality through a lens that is equally transformative yet daringly raw and different from Western cinema. Ringing true to the genuine human condition than anything I have seen from Hollywood, Shoplifters is a film that has shifted my opinion on modern directors and modern cinema as a whole. With Shoplifter’s we are truly drawn to a familiar world where the lens provides a gaze though the eyes of a real auteur. While I always disregarded the notion that anything shot with a modern camera in modern settings could materialize into the type of work that Kurosawa or Ozu have created, I have always believed filmmakers like these have unmatched qualities, until now. Koreeda’s extreme sense of self-awareness and implementing a strong social dynamic, the characters and narrative of Shoplifters blossoms into a truly hearty cinematic experience.Although the story and narrative of Shoplifters really has no real importance, this is a film that truly draws from its actors and their interactions, to create a family that really delves into the depths of complex moral issues, bonds of love and the ideas of nature versus nurture, that hasn’t been seen in film for many years. Yet, the casting in the film is perhaps, and although this may be a wholly bold statement, the best casting I have seen in at least a decade. Ranging from young child actors to older and respected Japanese acting icons, each familial role is worked and managed into broken down fibres of relatable family members we have in our own lives.The film tells the story of the Shibata’s. Osamu Shibata, played by Lily Franky, the real patriarch of the family, provides the film with the majority of its humour, especially when he is teaching his ‘children’ the fine ‘art’ of theft. Early on, we see that he passes on his skills to his ‘son’ Shota played exceptionally well by Jyo Kairi. Relentless and effortless, the two are shown to be very close and possessing so many of the dynamics seen between a father and son relationship we have come to expect in film. Shota’s mother, Nobuyo (Sakura Hando) works at a dry cleaners providing her share for the family, also engaging in forms of theft. Nobuyo’s sister Aki (May Matsuoka) works at a soft-core gentlemen’s cyber club performing for her dividend. All of the finances rendezvous at the flat the family stays in tucked away in an extremely quiet neighborhood. A large chunk of the rent that comes along with space is paid for by the true matriarch of the household, Grandmother Hatsue, played tirelessly by Kirin Kiki, who recently passed at the tender age of seventy-five.While each character’s role is paramount in expressing the moral teachings in Koreeda’s perfectly woven story, there is a firm affinity for Koreeda’s sense of family and togetherness that does not go unnoticed. Each family member play each of their respectable roles honestly, spreading words and dialogue that ceases to shy from the harsh realities of such a lifestyle, yet brilliantly completely shatter society’s belittling and scoffing nature towards them by being individual embodiments of humanity at all stages and ages of life.The family begins to change its dynamic when Osamu and Shota walk home one evening from a routine shoplift, and find Yuri (Miyu Sasaki), a small child left in the barren waste of her broken family’s home. Together, the two males bring Yuri back home, and the family agrees to keep her safe and make her one of them, a Shibata, due to their parents physical, emotional and mental abuse that can be heard from the open windows of their home.",

Some of the scenes feel as gratuitous and mostly used for shock-value for the Japanese middle-class audience (the introduction to the family home with the granny cutting toenails at the table is so ham-fisted than it becomes too farcical). Other critics say that you have to wait for the second part to see resolution. If that is a case, then the director commits the number crime in art: boredom! As for the other comments on \"humanism\" (heart-wrenching etc...) and \"naturalism\" or \"realism\", these actually confirm the lack of intrinsic artistic value of this film since \"mirroring the reality of those less fortunate\" reeks of the most hypocritical impulse of the middle-class, pity and commiseration.",

This is a difficult film to watch for a number of reasons, the most prominent being that the script and the story it tells is confusing and almost impossible to follow. The last third of the film tries to explain who the characters really are and the motivations each has in relation to the other but this places too much of a burden on the audience who, for 2/3 of the film had to sit adrift and at sea in trying to find out exactly what is going on. Much like the critics of the artsy Ingmar Bergman movies, so many of the critics who loved this film saw more in it than I believe the writer/director ever intended. The editing room needed someone in it in addition to Mr. Koreeda in order to give objective cuts, segues and scene placement changes so that the story sought to be told would be more easily understood. In its present form, however, and bearing in mind the kindness of the season, I it a 6.0  with the responsibility for this low rating falling squarely on the shoulders (and probably the ego) of Mr. Koreeda.",

It has since gone on to win 11 other awards and was recently nominated by the Golden Globes for Best Foreign Language Motion Picture.The merit for all these accolades isn't immediately apparent to audiences when initially delving into the picture, which features a small but close-knit family unit reliant on shoplifting and other petty crimes to survive.However, the film becomes more and more engrossing as the ties that bond the characters together are further tested and examined.  Additionally, since domestic audiences aren't familiar with the actors, it lends an incredible amount of authenticity to their roles, further amplified by writer/director Hirokazu Koreeda's impeccable camera placement.In the end, this isn't a film that leaves you either exhilarated or exhausted when exiting the theater.

And the result is one long satisfying stay. You feel like a guest entering his world and he welcomes you with open arms. He is a host that respects the boundaries and sculpts the antics accordingly. To be honest, his film is split into only two acts. It all starts with Yuri (Muyi Sasaki) accepting the house as a guest and the response she gets from each member of the house. Picking out a string of an equation of each member of the family with her, the act spirals out series of sequences that brick by brick constructs a suave strong bonding in the risky yet overprotective house.And on the other side, the second act, is completely opposite, it deconstructs those already established rumors, with the help of the clues spread around in its first act, and the fire catches slowly and poetically. The characters start questioning things that we- the audience- have been questioning from the first frame, and this connection has its own merits, it feels incredibly cathartic to dance in sync with the characters. Aki played by Mayu Matsuoka has the strongest role to portray, particularly since she is away from all the razzle dazzle that this family goes through.And yet spiritually she finds the same mirror to confront herself in. Her bonding with her grandmother that isn't actually explored thoroughly in the film is actually subjected to Sasaki's character that is in her initial stages of this grand welcome of the family; a masterstroke by the writer. Osamu (Lily Franky) and Shota (Jyo Kairi), the core relationship of the film pins down the fragility of the responsibility that a teacher or an idol carries but personally I loved his equation with Aki (Sakura Ando) as it never fully conjures the screen.There is a lot that they have been through and evidently a lot we have to catch up with, the decision maker and the hard worker and the nature versus nurture, these improvements raised in early stages makes it more shady and juicy. And Ando as a protective guardian to this family has performed majestically, her confessional scenes- and there are plenty- can reason out of the room, the moment when she finally accepts Sasaki as her daughter and burns her clothes, is one of the best scene of the film.It projects not only her willful right and the command over the spirit but also her confident to be a parent; a powerful scene sincerely fabricated by equally powerful performance. Koreeda's world is actually too diplomatic to be cinematic, yet his meticulous script that glorifies tiny characteristics of the scenario, brings out an exhilarating experience from us. This is a sort of script that thrives upon various elements, collecting them like coins, Koreeda is on a sprint for a marathon where at the end of the line, these Shoplifters are more humans even though less civilized.",

All more impressive given the fact that it takes place in Tokyo, one of the most advanced and 'robotic' places on Earth. But perhaps this is what gives it power.The plot is simple enough. A family of small-time crooks decide to take in a child they find outside in the cold--thanks for formulating it for me, IMDB. Her name is Yuri (Miyu Sasaki), still in pre-school. As she slowly blends in with the family, Koreeda pulls us into their small hovel in which they all live crowded on top of each other. But they are happy! I started to ask myself, so what's the problem, exactly? And here it is what this film does best!Its subtle, it pulls you inside a comfortable family bubble, and then when you feel at peace, you realize that hold on--what about the girl's parents? What about the police looking for her? You suddenly realize that from an outside point-of-view, what they did to her is bad. Instead of returning her to her family, they unofficially adopted her. But Yuri is also reluctant to return home as her parents are neglecting her.Slowly, two contradicting moral and social views arise yet you can't help but feel that despite the condition in which she leaves, Yuri is better off with her artificial family. But if this were to be part of the news on TV you would definitely not feel the same--I know I wouldn't. Koreeda is using the film's personal and insight view as a means of compelling our morality to offset our ration. But this is not surprising. As an art form, films are made to adhere to our emotions rather than our mind.There are many great moments in this film, most, although not all, coming from the relationship of this family. I will not spoil them here because they are too many but more importantly they are to be experienced first hand. No surprising plot twists whats-o-ever just pure, personal, relatable humanity.",

His new picture, Shoplifters, has garnered widespread criticalHirokazu Kore-eda has been heralded as an unsung hero of current direction, a modern day Yasujiro Ozu, who has seen success both in his home country of Japan and overseas. His new picture, Shoplifters, has garnered widespread critical acclaim, winning the coveted Palme D'Or at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.Having seen this film, I can only say that Shoplifters is thoroughly deserving of its praise; here, Kore-eda has succeeded in crafting a subtle, yet affecting film, detailing the story of a band of marginalised thieves, forced to shoplift to get by in a poverty-stricken corner of Tokyo.What is perhaps most striking about Shoplifters is how it manages to be so profound, yet at the same time being so understated. Like many of the director's films, family lies at the heart of this, though in often darker and more twisted ways than one might expect. Osamu (played with a **** edge by Lily Franky) and his wife, Nobuyo (a captivating Sakura Ando) are exploitative both in their relationship with the elderly Hatsue (Kirin Kiki), whose pension they abuse, and with the young waifs they take in (kidnap or save? this is left suitably ambiguous). There is a definite air of darkness that hangs about the film, yet, even in the bleakest moments, there is a tenderness too, with many scenes showing the endearing ways in which the \"family\" bond with and depend on eachother, especially after taking in the abused youngster, Yuri (Miyu Sasaki).The picture is also beautifully shot, Ryuto Kondo's artistic cinematography assuaging the drama and aiding the film's subtlety and beauty. Most scenes are long and languid, the dialogue effortless and naturalistic and executed by a talented and, even against the odds, likeable ensemble. Credit should also be given to Shoplifters for never glossing over its themes; young Aki's employment in a hostess club and the abuse suffered by Yuri lie in the background, understated, yet profoundly affecting. The themes of the film are complex, blurring the lines of morality and responsibility, yet it never feels heavy; Kore-eda is letting his audience form their own opinion about the issues represented. What Shoplifters may lack in clear plot, it makes up for in rich and fleshed out characters and sharp writing, which ranges from witty to silently poignant. The film rambles a little in a more cluttered third act, but this is made up by an utterly heart-breaking coda.With Shoplifters, Hirokazu Kore-eda has crafted a near perfect picture, elegantly executed and quietly moving, with an important and incredibly human message at its core",

Both center around poor families that are ultimately trying to find their place on this planet, but end up in significant trouble. Obviously it's a loose connection, but one that came to mind. First things first, I adored the nature of the relationships between all of the characters. They felt genuine and sweet, even if it ended up to be an absolute travesty.  The caring of the abused girl, the hectic but loving overall family feeling, it was cozy. Secondly, the story unfolds softly and throughout, there are clear views into the troubles surrounding each character and the full exposure of them at the end was pretty shocking. I didn't lose my jaw to the floor, but there was some things that I initially didn't fully catch, such as the grandmothers granddaughter being the reason why she was being paid. I still don't get the \"\"stole the husband\"\" part, I'm guessing killed by accident? I'll have to look that up. Anyway, the point I'm trying to get at is the information is present, but not forced to the forefront assuming the viewer is too dumb to notice, and not too subtle as to hide them in the weeds. It's a great balance of drip feeding these bits of unraveled story. The tragedy of it all is Juri, who ends up back with her neglectful and abusive parents.Lastly the cinematography was mostly awesome. There were some excellent shots. Even at worst the cinematography was good. Everything seemed very well thought out. What a good movie.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nWe know very well that poor families suffer winter more than any other, yearning, whilst their bones splinter, the warm breeze of a summer morning. We know, as well, that when the sun and humidity arrive, these same families perspire and suffocate, seeking shade and shelter among deteriorated housing units that, paradoxically, end up amplifying the feeling of asphyxia. Addressing a colossal challenge like Shoplifters, a showcase of this world, demands a distinguished sensitivity in the narrative disposition of its script and, necessarily, an impeccable direction; that is, the satisfactory achievement of an intricate project that demonstrates full mastery in the use and handling of specific audiovisual poetics. But how far can this poetics go? Possibly, as far as what was achieved by Hirokazu Kore-eda in his latest film. Shoplifters (2018) is a jewel of hylemorphic cohesion, a risky gamble, which adds to the endless debate on the human question. It is about the film technique at the service of an impossible story, as impossible as life and the contradictions that abound in the heart of our modern societies. With the new motion picture of Kore-eda, we are witnessing a story of extreme delicacy, which makes us forget at times, through characters so fascinatingly portrayed, either by their singular histrionic charm or by the unstoppable dynamics of the acting ensemble, that the best intentions are always measured by their consequences and collateral damages. What is trully problematic comes from the careful consideration of the principles of its characters, particularly those presented by the ones who are adults, because, even though condemned socially, they raise a lot of questions about our own conception of what exactly does a family is and mean (...). What comes in the middle is a recrudescence of the harsh and ambivalent sensations that are thrown towards the spectator facing the events unfold. The characters go from mere cartoons to the nervousness that always accompanies the process of cracking an imposter. And we watch, then, how the narrative oscillates with violence between polarized extremes, namely, from the kidnapping of a girl to her warm acceptance within the household of the abductors, which is capable of making her feel, for the first time, determined, respected and loved; from frigidity to indulgence, from anonymity to intimate consideration of a stranger, from the dream of living in a new house with your family to the humbled recognition that your child can be lost joking about an expensive hammer... from living miserably to die incognitably. Bury me in the yard under the tiny pond (...). Its greatest virtue lies in the universality that underlies the act of unmasking others and finding, behind their faces, a mirror. Kore-eda decides to go a little further giving us the story of a family whose members, to a greater or lesser degree, resemble all families (...). Shoplifters shows us a different but more palpable Japan than ever. A demystified nation, stripped of marketing and the omnipresent katanas of the Tokugawa Period. There are as many Japan as there are Japanese, and the misfortunes and tribulations suffered in this hemisphere are endured over there under the coordinates of their cultural context. In a context in which the sweet character of Father Coloma (Ratón Pérez) has not been able to penetrate, we are reminded that, in childhood, there are mythical stories more transcendental than those told by our parents or relatives in sleepless nights. We are talking about the living narrations, of flesh and bone, embodied in the beings we love and admire as children. When not even your mother wanted to have you, you become someone like us.Therefore, it is infertile to lecture on the intensity degrees of filial love, a fact that anguished Nobuyo deeply. Furthermore, it is a futility to aspire to quantify if the family that has been given to us, arbitrarily, is more loved than the one we choose, coming to it long after birth. For a child of Yuri’s or Shota’s age, anyone can be family if they receive from them an affective and respectful treatment... anyone. Even a thief. If insisted on ignoring such an elementary and foundational premise of the human psyche, there will only remain the recalcitrant grief of a lonely girl, already forgotten by her abusive father and her abused mother, who with a tender voice recites us the songs of numbers (to learn to count) taught by the monstrous family that kidnapped her for months (making her feel loved). There shall be left her sweet polychrome sketches of a visit to the beach. The candid melancholy of such a girl, seems to want to please the vertigo while holding the railing of a balcony that resembles where everything started. In her retina, the memory of feeling part of something still sparkles, despite the fact that she lived so far away then from her real family... In her memory, the immortal flight of his brother Shota still gleams...",

It felt quite authentic, although I suppose I wouldn't necessarily know how such people live their lives. I found it endearing how the younger members helped each other out. There is some funny dialogue - in an amusing way, rather than especially laugh out loud. I found myself feeling quite sorry for some people, due to their circumstances. It is surprisingly thoughtful, I suppose. Overall I thought this was a very warm and charming film, which I'd recommend, especially to fans of Japanese films.
