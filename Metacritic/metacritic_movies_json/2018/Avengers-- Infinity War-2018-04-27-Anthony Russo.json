A despot of intergalactic infamy, his goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and use them to inflict his twisted will on all of reality. Everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment – the fate of Earth and existence itself has never been more uncertain.… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The Avengers latest stand feels well worth the wait. It’s not perfect, but it goes to a place most tentpole movies wouldn’t dream of, while retaining the scale, excitement, and humour you’ve come to demand from an MCU movie.",
    "Marvel has solved their third-act problem and villain problem and then some. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. But then, neither are our heroes.",
    "The perfect mix of thrilling action, compelling storytelling, memorable characters, comedic moments — and all of that works in tandem like an orchestra bellowing an epic score. Infinity War leaves audiences wanting more… and with a lot to think about.",
    "Avengers: Infinity War is epic in a way that has been often aspired to but never fully grasped when it comes to the translation from comic book panel to the Big Screen. It’s what happens when moviemakers take their source material seriously, eschewing unnecessary melodrama even as they fully embrace the grandeur, the sheer spectacle, of it all.",
    "After years of movies where even the most mediocre heroes appeared to be invulnerable and indomitable, it’s an arresting jolt — and exactly the film the franchise needed.",
    "The film boasts plenty of comic-book action while also making room for a darker tone and emotional resonance rarely matched in previous installments. In a cinematic world stuffed with big-budget movies, Infinity War is a genuine blockbuster.",
    "Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain to set the stakes higher than ever, Avengers: Infinity War successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics.",
    "Never has the “Marvel Cinematic Universe” seemed like more of a universe, in ways both good and bad. Infinity War—the title is almost too apt—is a narrative juggling act the likes of which I’m not sure I’ve ever seen before. It is far from a perfect movie, but it is probably close to the best movie it could have been.",
    "The Marvel films have been accused of being repetitive in their structure; Infinity War bursts any conventions wide apart. This is a vast, truly epic endeavor, one that both brings the current MCU to a near-climax (wait for the so-far-untitled follow-up, due May 2019, for the ultimate resolution), and sets the future in motion.",
    "No, it’s not a game-changer like \"Deadpool\" or \"Logan.\" It remains firmly anchored within the “traditional” comic book milieu. But, with an unwavering devotion to spectacle and action, the film throws down a gauntlet where this kind of mass team-up is concerned.",
    "Infinity War might be the biggest and most ambitious Marvel movie yet, but it’s certainly not the best. (I’d put it somewhere in the bottom half of the Top 10.) However, there’s plenty of action, humor and heart — and some genuinely effective dramatic moments in which familiar and beloved characters experience real, seemingly irreversible losses.",
    "It could have been an unholy mess, but with directors Anthony and Joe Russo at the helm, Infinity War is instead a glorious, multilayered and clever comic-book adventure with loads of emotional stakes and a perfect foe for Earth’s mightiest heroes.",
    "Ultimately, the latest Marvel event is ‘Civil War’ on steroids and as enormous a spectacle as you’ll ever see on the screen that’ll leave you shook. For a movie plot this thin and basic, ‘Infinity War,’ is remarkably gripping, supersized entertainment that should exhilarate audiences, electrify the box office and continue the Marvel hegemony for years to come.",
    "With so many ingredients to stir into this overflowing pot, you have to hand it to the two experienced teams of Marvel collaborators who had a feel for how to pull this magnum opus off.",
    "It’s a sleekly witty action opera that’s at once overstuffed and bedazzling.",
    "The script is surprisingly smart, pulling together all the subplots and cutting among all the locations. Chris Pratt’s Star Lord has some clever lines. Thanos is a far more complex villain than we usually get. And the movie ends on a stark and shocking note.",
    "Somehow in its pure uproariousness, it works. It’s just a supremely watchable film, utterly confident in its self-created malleable mythology. And confident also in the note of apocalyptic darkness.",
    "A comic-book flick that’s as thrilling and enthralling as it is pretentious and preposterous. The story is just an excuse for the action sequences, and the Marvel strategy remains intact: When in doubt, blow stuff up.",
    "It’s exhausting, but it’s also frequently effective. It’s surface-level with its emotional beats, but a number of them still land, largely thanks to the continuously all-in performances of the series’ endlessly patient stars. It’s an event that advertises itself as an event in every way, while somehow still managing to justify the immense hype around it.",
    "It’s filled with moments that click, but it just feels too big.",
    "All the past decade’s Marvel movies have been heading toward this showdown. Turns out the payoff was worth the wait.",
    "There are moments of high drama in Infinity War—between father and daughter, brother and brother, mentor and protégé, lover and lover—that these actors, as deep in this series as we are, deliver on with teary intensity. And there’s a haunting final sequence that is as grave and, I daresay, almost poetic as anything the film series has done.",
    "Infinity War is big, blustery and brave, taking viewers to places that they may not be used to going.",
    "What saves Infinity War from being just another bloated supergroup tour – and what will end up being the thing that blows fans’ minds to dust – is the film’s final stretch.",
    "As a virtuoso juggling act, Infinity War has no real parallel in popular culture; as a movie, it’s an impressive montage of greatest hits until the gut punch of a finale.",
    "Avengers: Infinity War leaves viewers up in the air, feeling exhilarated and cheated at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes ... at least not yet.",
    "So, for basically 90 percent of this movie, I’m sitting there thinking, Okay, this is awesome. Then things changed slightly. And I need to be clear: not to the point it changes how I feel about the movie. I still enjoyed it immensely. But Infinity War did send me out on an unfulfilled note, which, to be fair, is probably by design",
    "Flagrantly, bombastically extravagant, it plays its audience like a hundred million fiddles.",
    "Whatever else it may be — a culmination, an obligation, a staggering feat of crowd control, a truly epic tease — Avengers: Infinity War is a brisk, propulsive, occasionally rousing and borderline-gutsy continuation of a saga that finally and sensibly seems to be drawing to a close.",
    "The Russos and the hundreds of craftspeople who worked on this film have dreamed up marvelous battles — especially the one where a motley assortment of heroes take their cracks at the purportedly unstoppable Thanos. But only once here did an intergalactic vista catch my breath the way a splash page in a Silver Surfer comic might.",
    "Infinity War boasts the most breathtaking, audacious moment in superhero movie history, one that rocketed through my brain and tore apart everything I thought I knew about the past 10 years of Marvel moviemaking. For the first time in a while, I can’t wait to see what happens next.",
    "Avengers: Infinity War cares a bit too much about being \"Part 1\" and holding enough development for \"Part 2,\" but MCU fans should see their 10-year buildup expectations met - not exceeded, but met.",
    "Directors Joe and Anthony Russo move their many playing pieces around with as much grace as possible, and they offer up jolts of pleasure throughout.",
    "Some of the sequences are undeniably thrilling but, at about 2-1/2 hours, overkill sets in early.",
    "This story may be on its last legs, but as table-setting for an even bigger threat, Infinity War daringly leaves more questions in the air. The way this world ends looks to be not with a bang, but a whimper.",
    "Picking up where Joss Whedon, director of the first two “Avengers” films, left off, sibling filmmakers Anthony and Joe Russo have so many pairings and sparrings to work through that the movie is essentially a mixed martial arts extravaganza with a severely overcrowded undercard.",
    "Characters overflow on the screen, crowding out emotional investment, and there is a severely misplaced emphasis on the power of special effects — many characters appear to be entirely digitized, and none has much screen impact.",
    "This movie shouldn't just engage and amuse and occasionally move us; it should shock and scar us. It should kill Ned Stark and Optimus Prime and Bambi's mommy, then look us in the eye after each fresh wound and say, \"Sorry, love. These things happen.\"",
    "It’s really the simple pleasure of seeing so many good actors together that makes “Infinity War” — an “Ocean’s Eleven” in hyper drive — work.",
    "Organisationally, the movie has a struggle on its hands not to seem like the contents of a toy chest simply chucked down the stairs, with all the chaos of limbs and accessories that implies.",
    "Thanos is the most interesting, and most complex, character here.",
    "It’s hard to give sibling co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo (makers of the thornier Captain America films) any credit—or blame, really—for steering a product that’s been so corporately fine-tuned. They toggle dutifully between million-dollar quips and Wrestlemania smackdowns, and when they find room for a vista of galactic stillness, it’s not out of any inspired vision so much as the need for air.",
    "I appreciate the sheer logistical achievement of Infinity War (and the chutzpah of its ending). I laughed a bunch of times, and some of the scenes are definitely exciting. But I would be lying if I pretended this movie ever grabbed me the way the best MCU movies did.",
    "Infinity War inherits plenty of the problems endemic to crossovers: the privileging of quantity over quality, of spectacle over story, and of the shock value of major changes to the status quo over just about everything else.",
    "The plot consists of bits: a fiery slugfest, a pause for bonding, a quick weep, and a patch of jokey repartee, before the slugging returns. Acts of sacrifice are dotted throughout, and we are urged to applaud the burgeoning fellowship of those who unite against Thanos, but, in truth, it’s every man for himself.",
    "As for everything that happens this time around, it’s a function — or malfunction — of the sequel’s two-part structure. The problem is penultimateness, too much setup and too little payoff. The solution comes, presumably, around the same time next year.",
    "Over the last few years, the Avengers, together and separately, have spawned a number of good, very good, or reasonably entertaining movies. But with Avengers: Infinity War, the Marvel Comics franchise arrives at the stage of decadence. There’s just too much of it. A victim of its own success, there are just too many appealing characters here to stuff into one story.",
    "The film has its momentary diversions, a few good throwaway jokes amid a tremendous amount of PG-13 maiming and destruction.",
    "Ordinary rules of drama don’t apply in the Marvel Universe, so expecting Avengers: Infinity War to build suspense, reach a climax and deliver some sort of conclusion is just…unreasonable.",
    "Where you end up may not be where you thought this was going. The final act, including the post-credits sting (to infinity and beyond, as it were) brings a chill, a darkness and a hush that represent something new in this universe.",
    "Infinity War is all manic monotony. It's passably numbing in the moment. And despite the hard-luck finish—something an obligatory post-credits sequence goes a long way toward neutering—it's instantly forgettable.",
    "Sitting through its 2 hours and 30 minutes is like gorging on tapas: You wind up both overstuffed and unsatisfied.",
    "There’s no pacing in Avengers: Infinity War. It’s all sensation and no pulse. Everything is big, all of the time.",
    "Even by Marvel’s own standards of serviceable mediocrity, Infinity War fails."

I'm quite honestly still reeling from what I just witnessed! Well... first thing's first! The pros: Each character had their own cool or unique moments. I was really pleased for the most part with the amount of time each of the characters had in the spotlight! The action in this also rarely let up! Once the movie started, it really got going and didn't slow down a whole lot until the very end!  Furthermore, I felt or went through just about every emotion under the sun while watching this! Joy, excitement, sadness, anger, anxiety, you name it, I felt it! To top that all off, my heart just about wanted to shatter during certain moments! I can't even begin to express how often I found myself yelling at the screen overall! I'll also say that the personal icing on the cake for me was the post-credit scene, as it alluded to an upcoming MCU film that I've been beyond excited for! The cons: Certain character deaths were rushed and unearned in my opinion. And also, some heroes that come to mind that I felt didn't receive quite enough screentime were Hulk, Black Panther, Bucky Barnes, and sadly Steve Rogers too. Other than that, I'd say that most everyone else got their fair share of screentime. And lastly, OF COURSE it had to end on a cliffhanger for Avengers 4 next year, so that was obviously highly frustrating, especially since it left us hanging on a not-so-pretty note, but that's all I'll say! Overall, this was one wild film and quite a lot to take in all at once to be honest! However, I still loved and was actively and emotionally invested in so much of it that I can say with certainty that this was a step above the slightly weaker Age of Ultron, but the lightheartedness and sheer fun of the very first Avengers remains my favorite still, but like I said, you certainly can't go wrong with this one either!",

The action, theInfinity War is the pinnacle of what blockbuster films should be. Directed by the Russo brothers, they manage to achieve the almost impossible feat of culminating all the characters and their stories into one epic film. The action, the characters, the story and the overall experience is spectacular to behold. Each characters has their own moment to shine, as we see new fun and somewhat emotional interactions between characters and story arcs that pay off as the film progresses . The result is a film that often feels surprisingly earnest and emotional. It pays off our emotional investment into these great characters over each of the 18 previous films through a great culmination of storytelling. The humor we have come to expect in Marvel films is lively and full of banter, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and the quick-fire interplay between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Unlike Marvel's cascade of villains who are turned secondary to their superhero counterparts, Thanos (Josh Brolin) is the central character in this epic, with a moral compass that is beyond what many might expect. Whilst he may seem to be the most demonic villain that the Avengers have come across, he is by far and away the most complex of them all, testament to the directing and writing of the film. There's a lot going on in this movie, with many scenes occurring almost simultaneously, leaving the ending on a much vague yet appropriate cliffhanger. Overall, Infinity War epitomizes the perfect blockbuster film that ends in poetic grace and is sure to leave you questioning what will happen next.",

It is an astonishing film that assumes that you have seen and is a fan of the 18 MCU films before it. It is not a film that can stood by itself,   It is a culmination of 10 years worth of 'hard work', interconnected story lines, multiple characters that define the MCU.  It is also a film that shows us that Marvel is so way above the curve in comparison to other studios that tries to establish an inter connected universe.  It also ends in a gut wrenching third act that segue in the 4th, yet untitled Avengers film.  Believe me, things will go bad, with many comparing this to the level of Empire Strikes Back.  Acting wise: Josh Brolin is an absolute stand out as Thanos, the main villain. He is the best villain the whole MCU.  The rest of the casts are no slouch either, balancing humor and tragedy in equal measure. The action sequences are also astonishing, with a higher stake: our heroes can and will die in this installment.  An absolute classic that ranks as the best MCU flick by far.",

The fact that we already know all the characters very well is just so awesome, like you feel that they are your friends and you are part of them and they a part of you.The story of the movie is very simple, is basically Thanos, the big titan, going after all the 6 infinity stones for him to be able to balance the universe, so our heroes unite to do their best to stop him.For a super-hero to be that good, it is extremely important for the villain to be good, for him no to be generic, and with happiness i say that he is perfect in every aspect. I'm gonna start with the most important, he is not that generic villain that want to destroy the universe just for this very reason, he does have a motivation, a rational reason that does make a lot of sense, you probably don't agree but surely buy the idea, because makes sense and it is in our day to day life. His personality is on point, the character can pass his ideas clearely, he does have charisma and among the villains some unique characteristics, he can express emotions better than a bunch of main characters in other movies. He is scary, you can see how powerful he is and how he is getting stronger during the movie, in some moments that you can just hear his steps, you squirms out of tension, in some moments you can see in his face that he is angry and is so notable how different things get whe he is like that, just at the beginning it does show how mighty he is.They gave him a background, wich helped to make us care about him to.The expressions that Josh Brolin had was so much on point. His Cgi is insanely great, it is so good that doesn't even seem that it is a cgi character, you completely forgets that it is fake. He did had a nice arc.The Black Order characters are all well designed and all had their moments, but only fauce de ebano were well developed, he did had his speech, kid of had a background and all of his moments were dope.The film splits into nuclei, all the heroes start isolated from eachother and posteriorly some end up finding others, and the 2h30min of movie help to it to happen in the most natural way as possible. The presentation of each core is done with mastery, inserting the audience into the language of the original film, whether through colors, as in the case of Asgard, or music, with the Guardians of the Galaxy and Wakanda. The movie does have a nice balance between comedy and drama, even that are some jokes that felt out of place, in the most they did worked and didn't disturb the tone of the movie, it still serious and with consequences. The movie has gigantic scales, it is not like any other movie that you did watched for sure, it is different thant any other, and this is another important factor that makes it so great. One of the best actions that i have ever seen, the movie is so happy in doing the heroes work together and use their powers together, it did make some iconic moments and very memorable scenes. And are moments that are like Lord of the Rings, a giant and stunning war, that i can't talk a lot about it to not spoil.It definely shocked me much more than i expected, there are so many surprises, it is like a napalm, there is so much happening and is so fast and so burner at the same time. Some action scenes just made my hole movie session scream like crazy. The interaction between the characters and the personality shock was done with maestry, they gave time for them to meet up and not feel weird that they are cooperating, all felt organic.If there is some bad things about the movie ? Yes, in some specific moments the cgi doesn't worked and is possibly that it took you off the movie a bit. Some things about the story doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but isn't that crucial and will not ruin the movie to anyone.You do feel the break from one nucleus to the other, i believe that could have had some better transitions, but i get that it is very complicated. There is one specific relationship that i believe that could have been more explored for us to feel kind of how Thanos was feeling in that moment.It did creates nostalgia with interactions of old characters and excitement with the new cross-overs.One thing that this movie can do to us, is let us apprehensives, considering how big of a treat that Thanos is you fear for the life of literally every single one, this kind of thing doesn't happens in almost none super hero movie. It is surely the most shocking Marvel movie.The movie is very creative whe it is about on the using of the power of the stones. It did had moments that happened things that you could never see it coming.Avengers Infinity War, does not have a great story, but is fun and show that not every super hero movie needs to be the same.",

Nearly all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies from the past ten years have led up to this one. So you should watch all of those before you start watching Infinity War. Because this movie doesn't give you time to breath and catch up. Loads of characters, settings, items, references of which the movie assumes that you are familiar with them. It's a rollercoaster that doesn't let up.  After preparing for ages, Thanos is making his last moves. He is coming. Dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives. Dread. That word actually describes this movie really well. From the very first scene you already know that the stakes are enormous, the threat is immediate and all encompassing, and stopping Thanos truly feels like the greatest challenge in the universe. There are still jokes, heartfelt moments, marvelous special effects and hilarious jokes. Like you would expect from any MCU movie. And amazing special effects, scenery, tech ...There are loads of characters and none of them get a lot of screen time, yet there's still character development (naturally not for all of them, not even for all heroes).This is also a movie about decisions and choices. My only gripe with the movie is that some of those decisions and their consequences break my suspension of disbelief. The fate of the universe is at stake people, come on ... are you really going to do that?! After two days, I'm still processing the movie and may 3 2019 can't be there fast enough to conclude phase three of the MCU.It's a different kind of superhero movie and it's amazing. Go watch it.",

You complete some levels (the solo movies) all the wayEver since Iron Man made its way into theaters in 2008,that was the beginning of the ambitious Marvel Cinematic Universe,that,from there on out,went on like a New Super Mario Bros game. You complete some levels (the solo movies) all the way up to the final level (the Avengers movie) of each world (Phase).This definitely seems like the last level (almost) of World 3. After 10 Years of waiting we’re finally here,and the hype is so intense that if you say something negative,it almost seems like a crime. That’s why I’ll talk about the negatives first instead of the goods,given that nothing is as perfect as,say,24 Carat Gold. Aside from some unbalanced CG and the score (which needs its own paragraph),I want to take a moment and despise the marketing team. The movie was marketed as ‘’The Biggest Event Of All-Time’’ (a thing most movies are doing nowadays),although the commercials were amping it up to an Interstellar-like seriousness. And while it’s a damn good movie,I wouldn’t say that it’s as good as Interstellar or Once Upon a Time In America,given that selling it like that makes the movie look like a legendary event (which,in part,is supposed to be). Let’s hope the team won’t do the same thing with Avengers 4 and learn from the mistakes.Also,darn it,was the score by Alan Silvestri (Ready Player One and The Avengers) disappointing! Coming out of RPO,I was amping my expectations up for this score,but all I got was another generic Marvel score whose little cues and overall theme will be remembered for sure other than the whole tracklist.Now that the problems are out of the way,there’s a LOT to talk about the positives.I admire what writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (Civil War and The Winter Soldier) did with the story,resulting in a Dunkirk-like structure,where it’s divided in 3 separate stories that,by the end of the movie,get connected together perfectly (like a complicated Puzzle). It DOES feel like if it’s Part 1 of a much-bigger event (the arrival of Avengers 4 in about a year),especially given that we have 79 characters in the ring.Tone shifts every now and then,and it’s a good thing,since each member,with its own screen-time,surprisingly,give you a moment to laugh or cry (Yes,the quips and jokes are there,but none of them detract you from the central story). For example,when we have Iron Man with Banner,Strange and Wong,it gets serious,but when we have the Guardians,it gets funny all-the-way. This is the most ‘Shakespearean’ (I guess) Marvel movie since the first Thor,so be on the look for that. The part I was mostly curious to hear about was how the crowd was going to react to the end,but I won’t say what happened because spoilers.Thanos (played by Deadpool 2 star Josh Brolin) is probably the best written Marvel villain of all-time. I loved his motivation,his charisma,his design,and rife with lines like ‘’I could just snap my fingers and you’d all cease to exist’’ or ‘’Perfectly balanced as all things should be’’,you know right away he’s perfectly written. However,as much as I would go full fanboy for him,I wouldn’t say he is as great of a villain as,say,Killmonger. It’s certainly better than Loki,but where Killmonger came with a more realistic approach,I feel like Thanos didn’t have all the cards on the table to be a great villain,for me only. Everyone will mostly rave about him nonetheless,(even if they should). Oh,and the motion capture is amazing,so…Every actor/actress was amazing all the way,from Downey Jr to Evans to Pratt to Saldana to….Basically everyone.As I said,yeah,some of the effects are unbalanced,but that doesn’t mean the CG is bad. All of the effects are off the chain,especially,as I said,the motion capture on Thanos.Look,if you see Infinity War as a fan,you’ll definitely enjoy it,but as a marketing choice,you’ll probably see it as a disaster on every level. But (there’s always a but) my heart was pounding all the way through the end,I laughed and I didn’t cry for those moments (bit of a serious person),so… I’m surprised to say it,but I’m curious to see what will happen in Avengers 4. Now the annoying part is that I’m going to hear everyone scream in pain for that movie while I get comfy for Incredibles 2. Bring it on,I guess…",

This film is packed with jaw-dropping visuals, exciting action, and surprising twists that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats from beginning to end. The film masterfully balances its numerous story arcs and characters to create a true spectacle that has never been done before. One of the true character standouts of the film is Thanos, portrayed by Josh Brolin. Brolin gives a compelling and heart wrenching performance as the film explores the trials and sacrifices Thanos must undergo as he travels the galaxy, hunting the six Infinity Stones. Other commendable performances in the film include Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Tom Holland as Spider-Man, Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, and Chris Pratt as Star-Lord. Alan Silvestri's incredible score adds a deeper layer to the film's story and is truly one of his best yet. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is filled with heart, humor, and sacrifice that help redefine what a hero should be.

Not to mention, for anyone who has ever read/watched at least a single piece of fiction, it's obvious all the heroes who died at the end of the movie are going to come back rendering the weight of anything that happens meaningless. Why can't movies do anything better than create a stupid villain with little to no background as a plot-device for its movie. What happens when no villains are around? Is there a constant influx of supervillains wishing for world destruction coming out of a portal every single day in these dumb universes?If a game attempted a similar storyline, it would get bashed seriously and receive a trash score. However, just because the name Marvel is stamped on the product, it instantly becomes a 10/10 by any fanboy regardless of the content.Spoiler alert: Avengers 100th movie is still going to be against a villain that makes no sense just for the sake of having a plot device to insert an infinite amount of CGI crap.

The whole movie feels like a huge shock factor stunt that aims to have emotional impact that weights down on the viewer but ultimately falls flat. The only emotion I felt leaving the cinema was regret for spending my money and anger at the creators of Infinity War, because frankly, there was a time I used to enjoy the MCU and felt like this movie that wanted to represent the climax of all the previous 18 movies ended up being a huge let down.A small advice. Next time when you will again try to create a dark movie with emotional impact, Marvel, try to be a little bit less obvious with your intentions and don't spoil the movie yourself by announcing sequels for all the supposedly killed off heroes before their \"sad deaths\". Be so kind and leave at least a small benefit of the doubt for the viewers. How can we feel sorry for a character's death when we already know said character, no matter how tearful threir dying scene is, will be brought back in the next movie? Do you think so little of your own fanbase? We all know the reason to why only the newer characters (with confirmed sequels) disappeared and the original stayed. We understand all the characters who died after the snap and Gamora who was sacrificed to get the Soul Stone will be coming back. And that it will be by the original Avengers doing in the Avengers 4. We understand it is the original surviving Avengers who are in true danger of dying for real in the MCU in the coming Avengers 4.That makes the characters whose deaths were not inflicted by the Soul Stone or Infinity Gauntlet possibly the only permanent deaths of Infinity War. At least Marvel gave us the benefit of the doubt there. You would think that it's these deaths Marvel takes extra care to make them be felt hard? Well, then you are sadly mistaken. The possible permanent deaths on the list include Heimdall, Loki & Vision (Vision is AI, he can be saved in some way by Tony or Shuri), so characters who were killed off quickly without an afterthought in an opening scene!!! And in this light it brings the IW movie even lower.Always when character gets killed for a shock factor, with the only purpose to show how powerful the newest villain is (I see you Warriors Three), I cringe. As I have already stated, shock factor deaths are just a result of awful screenwriting. Hey Marvel, if you want to create a truly awesome, fear inducing villain, there are better ways to do it. Have you forgot everything about character building? The irony Marvel decided to kill off in this manner its arguably most complex & popular villainous character makes it even worse. Loki was  introduced to us as a powerful magician who could trick even Odin, shapeshifter, user of telepathy, telekinesis, with inborn elementary ice magic, high intellect, manipulative deceiving skills who used to wield not one, but two infinity stones. Loki had Space Stone in his possession, he knew Thanos is coming for years and had time to prepare himself. Yet Loki is not shown fighting or using any of his skills.If someone told me before the IW that Marvel will make Loki go against Thanos with nothing but dagger out of all his skills, I would have laughed. Sorry but to give the very character that once threatened the whole planet of Earth and was the very reason project Avengers was created such a poor last stand was an awfully scripted mistake. Especially when he is the only big character truly dying in IW. The \"no resurrection\" remark as they felt the need to assure viewers that this time the trickster god is really gone was truly pathetic. And there is more than enough eye-roll inducing moments like this in IW movie.Gamora scene. That is HOW to make characters go with honour. Strong scene, with background story and fight. But again, I think she is coming back because her death is connected to the Soul Stone. If not, then this was the highlight of the movie. I sincerely doubt it tho.The only apspect I have praise for in this movie is the amazing acting. Marvel has put together incredibly talented cast and they are doing what they can to make the movie enjoyable. But their efforts are severely limited by the weak and predictable script. This has to be one of the worst movies in MCU.",

So they move from one location to the next, fighting and killing the current holders of the stones. Will he succeed?Post-credit scene: One at the very end but it’s a must-see.Negatives: 1)\tA major irritation with this film is the slow pacing, sometimes caused by too much pondering and exposition. Thanos’s destruction of one character/location after another has made the mood gloomy, but when the story transitions to another location, it takes too long for the next thing to happen. 2)\tThe film suffers from what critics have been warning for a long time – too many major characters in one film. Marvel was able to avoid the failures of DC Comics with Suicide Squad and Justice League, and in fact had major successes with Avengers 1 and 2 and Captain America: Civil War, but I think Marvel has reached a tipping point with this film. With so many characters, they could not spend more time with each character and cover character developments other than moving from one fight to the next. 3)\t(Cont’d) An example of this is the fight between Iron Man and a villain. It degenerates into the usual thing of Iron Man shooting lasers and missiles, while being thrown about and smacked with objects. There is nothing new! It becomes another throwaway skirmish, of which there are many in this film.4)\tA real problem with any story where the villain is trying to gather a number of powerful objects, which upon completion would render him/her invincible is, where the story goes from there onwards. This problem is made worse here as Thanos becomes more powerful as he acquires each Infinity Stone, rather than needing to collect them all before getting any power from each stone. This principle makes it ever easier for him to acquire each succeeding stone, such that it is guaranteed that he would complete his task. I am really worried as to how the story writers are going to fix this in Avengers 4.5)\tThere are some opportunities to stop Thanos somewhere in the film but they are wasted because of the stupidity and selfishness of some characters. Some character(s) even surrendered the stones. I think these situations were there just to milk out some drama but they were not well done.6)\tThe massive attack on Wakanda with Thanos’s army – it’s in the trailer – does not make sense, considering that prior attempts to acquire the stones had only involved a few super-villains but were executed very expertly. It smacks of a cheap attempt to insert a major battle into the film just to satisfy the fans, when it wasn’t necessary at all.7)\tThe scenes where the heroes who do not know each other meet up for the first time, was not done well. It seemed like the heroes trusted the other side and become friends too easily.8)\tThor and Peter Quill had developed greater powers in recent films, but neither of them used these powers here. Disappointing.9)\tThor remains insecure about not having a hammer and goes to get a new one. The entire sub-plot on this venture felt contrived and felt like an attempt to show a MacGuffin.10)\tThe strange ending was another gloomy scene. The audiences in the same theatre as me, felt drained, depressed and confused when the lights were turned on. Hang on! This could be just what the directors intended, which would make this a positive!11)\tOverall, the story felt predictable and this points to the linear and average story-writing. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 felt the same, but Thor and Civil War were surprising.Positives: 1)\tDespite this film being rather gloomy, there were still many funny moments, something that almost all of the DC Comics films never managed. 2)\tThe film did try to cover the backstory of Thanos, which I wasn’t expecting. Film critics cannot thus argue that this film did not have any character development.3)\tThe beginning of the film had some of our heroes losing continuously and badly to Thanos and his henchmen. When our heroes won decisively for the first time, it felt really great!How would the different age groups rate it?Children: Excellent;Teens: Excellent;Young adults: Good;\nMedium age adults: Good;\nOld adults: Average;\n\nRating: 4/5 (no half scores).

Outside of a so-so start, Infinity War entertains better than perhaps any other Marvel movie has to date. The action was fantastic, there were a few great jokes in there, and for the first time in a very long time I had to fight back tears over something that happens in the movie (seriously glad that moment only lasted for so long because I was ready to unload years of frustration and grief in one moment). It's tough to manage a lot of star power on the screen over 2 1/2 hours but Marvel manages it incredibly well. For the first time in an Avengers movie audiences don't necessarily get what they want and it's both infuriating and amazing. It'll be hard not to dish out spoilers and I won't spill any beans but the table that this movie sets is one of the most intriguing futures I can remember in movies - better than Star Wars (at least post-OG trilogy). Infinity War makes Captain Marvel and whatever the currently unnamed AV4 incredibly important. Bottom line: this is the Avengers movie to see in theaters, and see it in a big one if you can because having a big screen and Dolby Atmos was a blast for myself.",

If you are a longtime fan of 80’s & 90’s Marvel Comics and Ultimate Marvel, this is the movie of your lifetime. The creators of this film have done what many thought impossible; they have taken a gigantic cast of characters (old and new) and given every one of them purpose, meaning and a soul. Thanos is fully realized and has a purpose and motivation, not just “make the universe evil because I’m evil.” His “Black Order” storm onto the scene and all at once rivalries are created with our heroes. These foes are formidable and full on characters in their own rights. The movie is wall to wall action AND emotion, and it NEVER feels gratuitous. No character is “safe” and the danger is palpable. They make sure the viewer understands that immediately.This story is flat out Marvel Cosmic Universe, no pandering for general audiences.

EveryAvengers: Infinity War: 8.8\tEverything has been leading up to this. Infinity War’s biggest challenge was somehow juggling dozens of characters coherently without making the entire narrative spread out too far, and it succeeded. Every character gets a respectable amount of screen time that they deserve without any of them feeling like cameos or out of place. From Spider-Man to Black Panther each hero’s intro is just as exciting as the last with each intro bringing the hero’s own flavor into the movie, and this helps the film feel like the absolutely giant event that it is. It has an unbelievable amount of stakes and is probably the most serious of all Marvel movies. There’s harrowing parts to the film that are small and big, but Thanos must’ve had a hand in writing the script because the amount of dramatic and comedic moments is perfectly balanced. The movie is far from short on good laughs. There’s plenty of laugh out loud moments that don’t seep into other parts of movie and ruin some powerful serious moments, which Marvel movies have struggled with in the past. And the powerful moments are POWERFUL. They range from happiness, excitement, sorrow, shock, and sadness. They hit you so hard that after the movie it’s as if you’re suffering from shellshock. Thanos as a villain is phenomenal. Down to his motivations and his CGI he felt like a real person, and not just a one dimensional evil for the sake of evil villain. He’s driven, he’s dangerous, and interesting. This is Thanos’s story, this is his movie. His unique power set given to him by the infinity gauntlet is used as well it can be used. One of the inherent problems with a villain who can basically do anything is that makes you ask “Why doesn’t he do that every time?”. The film deals with that very admirably to the point where that question is actually answered… most of the time. And Thanos’s Black Order are quite dangerous themselves. They feel so lethal that you consider that they can each best multiple Avengers in combat single handedly. Despite the intense saturation of characters and villain who can do anything, the film is actually quite well written in the sense that there is no bad, cringy, or overdone lines. Which is hard to avoid in a big movie that is half the time spent in space. The narrative itself is executed exceptionally. It feels like one continuous story and not a jumbled mess. It almost feels like it’s told in chapters similarly to Pulp Fiction, at least in the first half. Like many of the other characters, the original Avengers Theme(which is a character in itself) also makes an epic return throughout the film. Enhancing the intensity of the story’s biggest moments, while evoking goosebumps, nostalgia, and even tears. When it comes to the films faults they’re little and minor. There’s a few laughs that are indeed funny but are drawn out a little too long, causing the joke to overstay it’s welcome. And during the second act the movie drags a little, but it only might do so because of the great anticipation of how the film will end, and that anticipation may compel you to grow a little impatient. But it’s not fully a fault in the film itself. There’s some actions that the ability of being able to perform those actions are muddled or left unexplained, maybe I might’ve missed the explanations, but it took me out of the movie slightly when it came up. What didn’t take me out of the movie was the CGI. One of the main problems with Black Panther was the overuse of CGI in the film, but T’Challa’s suit is a nice real looking practical suit that looks great. Again Thanos’s visual effects are some of the best ever, and never did the thought of green screen or brief rubbery replacements of characters cross my mind. Overall, the colossal event of Infinity War successfully handles a large plethora of characters while leaving more than enough room for exhilaration, emotion, and consequence that is abundantly present in this film much more than the films that came before it. So I give it an 8.8",

He is one powerful villain that not any hero including Iron Man, Spiderman, Hulk, and even Dr. Strange will stop by any chances of blowing up the earth, and they are right, he is one bad motherflicker off of this movie that cannot be stopped. This is by far MCU’s underdog villain sitting right next to Killmonger and Loki. And you could easily care about him of what are his motivations when he triggered the infinity war. The action, comedic humor, comic book references, intense emotion, outstanding direction, teriffic stuntwork, and the visual effects is what made Infinity War a powerhouse of MCU movies and it is damn worth seeing it. Without a doubt, Infinity War matches the depths of Logan and Civil War and you would immediately watch it again. (& Oh yeah, make sure you stay till the credits too!)",

He's a compelling character and you can feel he's a real-life human (except he's not). Josh Brolin performance makes Thanos even more realistic and humane. His motion-capture performance adds up to the character of Thanos, and that's really unusual or maybe doesn't happen unless we had Andy Serkis. The CGI in general is very good. Thanos has many great moving moments when he explains his motives, but despite how indirect and classy he illustrates his motivations, I hoped there were more ways to do so rather than using dialogue and nothing more. Also, I think there was no need for more explanations in the third act of the movie. C'mon, there is a final battle happens and Thanos still gives some reasons why he does that!  There's an incredible chemistry between almost all our heroes, and that enhanced the humor in this movie which, by the way, is splendid! Almost every joke hits the mark. The problem that there was a tonal shift between the first act and the second act that made a dramatic scene not as effective as it should have been, but it's really a very minor issue as it just happened one time.The character development features all along the movie itself not just as a complement to the previous movies.There are a lot of shocking moments and unflinching decisions that you have never seen in a Marvel movie.I have never been confused by the story's developments or many events as all of them are represented simply.

Josh Brolin is superb as Thanos, playing the real protagonist of the story as who moves on his insane quest to form the Infinity Gauntlet.  You understand his motivations (though they are based on the long disproven overpopulation myth) and feel when he makes some pretty devastating decisions.  Behind the camera, the Russos manage to a deliver a complete but packed film, mixing up the various MCU heroes in inventive ways (Iron Man & Dr. Strange play off each other brilliantly) while pulling off some brilliant action that sets a new standards in blockbusters.  Granted, if you're not familiar with the the Marvel movies, you will be a bit lost, but then, why would you even be seeing this movie anyway.  Simply put, especially thanks to the stunning ending, \"Infinity War\" delivers on it's promise, and you will be clamoring for the next \"Avengers\" movie as soon as you leave the theater.",

The movie isn't perfect, but it had enough interesting surprises and storyThere is only one thing a person can ask after coming out of this movie, and that question is \"did it live up to the hype?\". The answer, in my opinion, is a yes. The movie isn't perfect, but it had enough interesting surprises and story elements to keep me perfectly engaged. I didn't think one cast member put in a poor performance, they were all at least good. However, Robert Downey Jr. knocks it out the park. This is one of his best performances since the original Iron Man film, 10 years ago. Thanos, as the villian, is perfectly fine. They showed the right amount of human emotion to make him not completely stale, like the majority of marvel villians tend to be. Although, that being said, while he was completely ruthless and evil, elements of the film led me to actually reason with his character, and not completely hate him, which i don't know is a good thing or a bad thing. Now onto the issues. The cast is understandably bloated, so you find yourself having to keep up with all the different storylines happening at once, and it becomes quite difficult to follow everything. It felt like at least two of the main storylines could have been their own movie. There are a couple of plot holes and unexplained events that happen in the film, although it would be difficult to explain them without going into spoilers, so you'll have to take my word for it. The special effects i felt were very inconsistent, at times they blew me away and at other times looked rubbery and formulaic, but luckily the latter part of them were in less noticable shots. Speaking of camera work, the cinematography wasn't anything too special, it wasn't on the level of something like Dunkirk but it had enough interesting shots to keep me entertained. The dissapointing thing about a cast this large is that some characters would be forced to take a backseat, and in this movie some took a significant backseat. So much so, that i forgot some characters were even in the movie. From what i remember one of the most significant avengers had about 4-5 lines in the whole movie. Much like every other marvel movie there were a significant amount of quips and jokes, however i was hoping due to the high stakes and a more serious threat that they might have toned down the jokes but dissapointingly they didn't. That being said, the jokes didn't take away from any of the serious moments. It may seem like i didn't really like the movie, but i have to say, some moments absolutely blew me away, and i believe most came from the screenplay. It's difficult to discuss what i loved without spoilers, so you'll have to take my word that i did enjoy the movie. Not the best ever marvel movie, but nowhere near the worst.",

Brolin’s, Thanos is an infallible, and unmatched talent among previous Marvel Cinematic Universe villains. The leading antagonist (Brolin) could potentially challenge Heath Ledger’s maniacal depiction of the Joker. This is not because Thanos is a megalomaniac and indomitable being, but his excellency lies rational.  He is deft and absolute in both words and actions. He displays something inexplicably and hauntingly human about him. Thus, making him a fully realized anti-hero.Alan Silvestri’s beautiful layered soundtrack heightens the emotional intensity of the Avengers greatest threat to date. His ability to capture the constantly changing tone and as the inextricably linked narrative jumps from place to place is deserving of praise. The Russo’s Infinity Wars (Part 1) is sure to become a pop culture reference of the future, as they have managed to achieve with the Thanos and the Avengers what Bryan Singer failed to do with Apocalypse (a character of banal platitude) and the X-Men. But we are left with our appetites unsated, and waiting with both repressed clamour and bated breath for the conclusion of the enthralling and dynamic journey in 2019.-RJ",

The main issues with the movie just come from the fact that there are so many characters. The pacing is inconsistent at times, not always giving each character enough screen time or enough to do. The tone can shift as well, between dark moments where the audience is meant to feel emotional, to abruptly ending the emotional moment with a gag. But for the most part, all the main characters are given good roles in the movie and characters play nicely off each other. The acting from everyone is top notch and the action scenes are some of the best in the MCU. One of the best things about the movie is Thanos, and the overwhelming danger he puts over our heroes. Villains in the MCU don't always feel like they actually are a threat, but Thanos definitely is. Not only is he a menacing villain, but he is also a well written villain with clear motivations for why he wants the infinity stones.

The movie is easily the best of the MCU and defos one of the best movies of all time. The characters were brilliant, the fights were amazing and the story was driven home, especially for the third act. I was afraid all the characters would clash and be all over the place but it worked out amazingly. Characters like Iron Man who was amoung the first to feel the threat Thanos placed, Banner who along with being Thanos' first victim also had trouble with the Hulk that's explored reasonably well in the movie. Even the more smaller characters have time to shine, like Spider-Man who had some good banter with Doctor Strange, Nebula who is given more indepth about her relationship with Thanos and Gamora. Of course the deaths are where the movie truly shines, the first being Heimdall, and then Loki. When your movie has the nerve to kill off one of the most popular characters then you know your villian and the movie mean business. Gamora was another heart jerker as we knew what Thanos was about to do while Gamora herself remains oblivious. Then the big wipe out at the end, heartbreaking especially with Spider-Man and Groot (Dad).
