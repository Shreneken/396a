  "critic_reviews": [
    "We get what is easily the most personal and intimate film of Cuarón's career to date. His Roma is a movie with a clear and distinct setting but one that boasts universal appeal. It's also built around a relatively small, narrowly focused story -- but one that deserves to be seen on as big a screen as possible.",
    "Roma is persuasive in its beauty. It wins you over. The face of Aparicio, in the leading role, is not placidly resigned but serene in its stoicism, and if she is less a participant than a bystander during the major convulsions of the era, well, few of us can claim to be much more.",
    "Cuarón’s artistry yields a film with the pinpoint authenticity of a docudrama, but also the intoxicating and lyrical poetry of memories as filtered through a perfect dream. Sometimes we go to the movies and we’re rewarded with a masterpiece.",
    "Roma gives you so much to see in each new vignette, in every individual composition, in fact, that a second viewing becomes a pleasurable necessity rather than a filmgoing luxury.",
    "Roma, a masterful drama by Alfonso Cuarón, is many things at once: epic and intimate, mythic and mundane.",
    "Like all the best films, Roma is achingly specific while constantly opening up to the universal.",
    "It's an affecting, visceral work that deserves eyes on it no matter if it's projected in the darkened recess of the cinema or streamed in the comfort of a living room.",
    "Cuaron is content to take his time with Roma, allowing the camera to linger on his subjects and the frustrating banalities of ordinary, everyday life that sneak up on you with poetic significance as the film goes on",
    "Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma is a wondrously pure example of one of the great gifts that cinema can give us: to drop us into a time, a place and a life; immersing us in the sounds and the sights and the emotions, large and small, experienced by someone we’re not.",
    "The only thing I can imagine anyone offering in complaint about Roma is that the movie delivers an uncomplicated depiction of a secular saint. That’s true, to an extent, and yet it’s also what I love about this full-hearted, exquisitely crafted, deeply grateful film.",
    "The real achievement of Roma is Cuarón’s bold conception of a memory movie, blending childlike detail and adult detachment, and the rich visual and aural design that make this one of the more sensually pleasurable films of the year.",
    "Pairing thrilling technical prowess with profound artistic vision, Alfonso Cuarón has made a masterpiece, at once understated and otherworldly. We need more filmmakers like him.",
    "There’s no other way to say it than to say it: Roma is one of the best movies I’ve ever seen, and one of the most moving. If Norma Desmond had been able to see it she wouldn’t have worried about the pictures getting small.",
    "Cuarón uses one household on one street to open up a world, working on a panoramic scale often reserved for war stories, but with the sensibility of a personal diarist. It’s an expansive, emotional portrait of life buffeted by violent forces, and a masterpiece.",
    "Roma is hypnotic and transporting and sublime, everything a movie seen on the big screen ought to be.",
    "If a thing of beauty is a joy forever, as John Keats famously said, then the surpassing loveliness and bracing brilliance of Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma will never pass into nothingness.",
    "Though it takes the risk of appearing too quiet too long, Roma and its melding of the personal with a glimpse of a society veering toward collapse is incontestably persuasive, a film whose like we are not likely to see again.",
    "There’s a lot of love in ROMA, and, as is the way with love, it doesn’t always arrive in ways that are equal, or reciprocated, or even endure. His first film to be set in his homeland since Y Tu Mama Tambien in 2001 is Alfonso Cuarón’s most personal film, and his most honest. It may even be his best.",
    "A majestic feat of filmmaking, an intimate portrait of a family that also serves as a broad portrait of a changing nation.",
    "Cuaron has made his most personal film to date, and the blend of the humane and the artistic within nearly every scene is breathtaking. It’s a masterful achievement in filmmaking as an empathy machine, a way for us to spend time in a place, in an era, and with characters we never would otherwise.",
    "Experiencing the lovely and lyrical Roma, you get the impression that at age 56, Cuarón not only wanted to get these still-vivid memories down on film, but that he also needed to. You’ll be glad he did. Because movies with this much empathy and humanity don’t come along very often.",
    "A richly textured masterpiece, Roma is cinema at its purest and most human.",
    "This period epic...is so full of dazzlingly intricate visual poetry, so teeming with sensory spirit, that trying to review it is a bit like trying to review all of life. Which may sound a bit grandiose, but Cuarón’s magnum opus provokes such turgid sentiment.",
    "Cuarón never seeks a tidy resolution for their loving, lopsided, complicated relationship. But it’s one of the reasons why Roma leaves such a deep and lasting impression.",
    "This glorious, tender picture, a memoir written in film language, is only indirectly about the man who made it. He stands off to the side, in the shadows, beckoning us toward something. Roma is filmmaking as gesture, an invitation to generosity that we perhaps didn’t know we could feel.",
    "At times it feels novelistic, a densely realised, intimate drama giving us access to domestic lives developing in what feels like real time. In its engagingly episodic way, it is also at times like a soap opera or telenovela. And at other times it feels resoundingly like an epic.",
    "Roma may not be the memoir film many might have expected from such an adventurous, sometimes raunchy, sci-fi/fantasy-oriented filmmaker, but it’s absolutely fresh, confident, surprising and rapturously beautiful.",
    "Every individual scene feels filled with the lucid detail of a formative recollection or a recurring dream.",
    "Roma is by far the most experimental storytelling in a career filled with audacious (and frequently excessive) gimmicks. Here, he tables the showiness of “Children of Men” and “Gravity” in favor of ongoing restraint, creating a fresh kind of intimacy. Like a grand showman working overtime to tone things down, he lures viewers into an apparently straightforward scene, only to catch them off guard with new information.",
    "By its conclusion, Cuarón’s film proves itself both wonderful and fearsome. See it. You will never forget it.",
    "The exploration of political upheaval, class and gender inequalities make this an important film, but the fact that it always remains grounded in its personal story makes Roma a compelling and emotional film, shot masterfully by a veteran director who finally created his masterpiece.",
    "Roma is a special movie that needs that all-encompassing experience. Alfonso Cuarón has made yet another movie that will transport you to another time and place. You will feel like you’re living it.",
    "Alfonso Cuarón has created a heartfelt masterpiece of mood and nostalgia, one that reminds us that his gifts as a storyteller and an interpreter of the human experience are not dictated by scale of production.",
    "As evocative and soulful as I found parts of this movie, I experienced these stylistics as more evasion than immersion. Cuarón is so careful to avoid overdramatizing the narrative that his steady-state underplaying ends up seeming equally coercive. But this is not how we are supposed to react to “Roma.” We are supposed to regard it as “real life.”",
    "I reserve the right—as I do at every festival, where I tend to hedge my bets and temper my praise—to decide that, never mind, everyone’s right, this is a masterpiece. For now, what I see is staggering formal prowess that is maybe just a little at odds with the small, even modest character drama it’s supporting.",
    "This is personal filmmaking taken to such an extremely minute level that at times it can almost feel prurient, like we’re accidentally eavesdropping on things too private for our ears, like we’ve intercepted an embrace sent back through time and not really meant for us at all.",
    "This is a film that alternatively shows humanity in all its ugly glory as well is its quiet moments of beauty.",
    "Narratively, not a lot happens during the opening 60-70 minutes, but Cuaron is marinating us so that later events have an uncommonly strong impact.",
    "This is a film that challenges moviegoers in a way that a Marvel movie or rom-com will not, and it is worth taking the time and concentration — and, if possible, the trip to the theater — to view a true master of the craft at work.",
    "It is humane, beautifully shot in 65 mm and glorious black and white, full of keen observations, intimate details and nuanced performances. I was hypnotized and drawn in by the skill and heart of everyone involved.",
    "The result is a little too rose-tinted an homage, but Roma is still an exceptionally moving story, as well as another technical feat from Cuarón.",
    "Roma is both visually and emotionally arresting, grandiose and intensely intimate all at once.",
    "Despite the echoes of Fellini, the result feels almost new in a way and given the immersive nature of Roma it doesn’t seem so radical to consider experiencing its cinematic beauty with a clunky headset on.",
    "Alfonso Cuarón returns to his childhood for inspiration with the meticulously beautiful Roma, an autobiographical black and white thank you letter full of warmth and love.",
    "Roma is an elegiac and moving work driven by Aparicio’s understated and nuanced performance.",
    "Far from the year’s best movie, but in its best moments, it demonstrates a profound cinematic mastery.",
    "Roma is autobiography as autocritique, and in exploring a point of view adjacent to his own, Cuarón appears to have rediscovered his identity as a filmmaker.",
    "The tender story addressing the oppression of domestic workers includes brilliant moments of humanity, making the film attractive to the average viewer, but this film would not have received such praise had it come from a lesser known director.",
    "Roma is no mere movie — it’s a vision, a memory play that unfolds with a gritty and virtuosic time-machine austerity. It’s a Proustian reverie, dreamed and designed down to the last street corner and scuffed piece of furniture. Yet I actually think it’s far from a masterpiece, because as a viewing experience it has a slightly hermetic coffee-table-book purity. Every moment comes at you in the same methodically objective and caressing Zen way.",
    "Roma is arty and beautiful, but also a bit like sitting on a sofa while Cuarón flips through family photo albums, never narrating or over-explaining any single moment or image."

Is ROMA a person?  A place?  A terrible film?  All of the above?  This moving photograph will mean nothing to anyone other than a critic looking for a high brow concept with a low brow delivery.  All I came away from the screening of this thing was #MaidsLivesMatter and... so what.  The flimsy story is constructed around beautiful images, that more rightful belong in a photo album and not on a movie screen.  I was appalled at the lack of reality in the substance of the characters.  Also, I do not believe that the ending is in any way plausible.  The character who was the weakest suddenly becomes superhuman and stronger than a riptide.  I call bollocks.  Any one who isn't trying to blow something up someones somewhere, will not like this movie, and that is most everyone.",

One thing good about this movie tho; the photography, really beautiful shot.Now.... The actual history behind the movie is predictable, boring and poorly written. I never got to connect with any character, thanks to a very lack of emotions from them they are just cast into a one dimensional role, and they never get out of it. If he tried to portrait the maid as they are in Mexico (I mean very submissive and so desperate that they accept any circumstances) then all the other characters should have a large array of emotions so there's contrast. But there's just no contrast they're all superficial stereotype persons.A lot of scenes could  have also been removed and we could have ended up with a much shorter and less tedious movie instead we have a very long, predictable with a lot of useless scenes movie, might it repeat again there are some beautiful shots tho. I hope it doesn't get the Oscar because there are just so many better narrated and well shot movies out there.I will end my review doing this comparison;Roma is like a picture of some delicious food that you see it and it looks just so good, but then cut the picture and realize it was nothing but emptiness and regret to ever tried",

The main differences are that these films and directors didn't take 2+ hours to tell their stories or linger too long even by a second on a scene whether it be a boy looking out a car window or a dog jumping up against a gate. They brought new cinematography to the screen and more depth to their stories.Maybe it has been a long time since critics/people have seen such films that reflect life between the classes or maybe \"Downton Abbey\" has given them a false picture of the same. There are little passions or emotions shown by the director/screenwriter Alfonso Cuaron.The surprising aspect of \"Roma\" is the acting debut of Yalitza Aparicio as a maid who has a warm connection to the children of her employers and though she is a presence throughout the film it only comes alive when it concentrates on her trials and tribulations.With the exception of maybe 15 minutes, I was bored during most of the 2-hour 18-minute  \"Roma\".",

It was a great film, with a pensive portrayal of the life of a beloved maid in 70s Mexico. Definitely one of the best films I’ve seen in ages, but I couldn’t tell what the climax was - the baby arriving or the kids drowning. While not every film needs a “climax” to sum up a great story, I just felt this was a slightly less enjoyable watch than A Star Is Born or even The Favorite. Roma is a film with a meticulously curated series of shots that cleverly cover a thin story. A film which the critics love but the audience may struggle to enjoy. I enjoyed it...

WhereasCritics fall over themselves for another slick foamy soapy film from Cuaron, with very simple cinematographic tricks. It is obviously copying Zerkalo (The Mirror) by Tarkovsky but with far less ingenuity, creativity and poetry. Whereas Tarkovsky makes his life and his memories interesting by cleverly destroying time and space, blurring the lines between reality and dream, and making us think, think, think about our own memories, Cuaron serves a linear, egotistical, boring diaporama of his own life that didn't touch me at all. All this of course with a heavy dose of sentimentality and \"humanism\" that can't go wrong with middle-class critics.But what about the cinematography?The initial slow constant circular movement of the camera is obviously designed to clash with the perpetual zig-zagging of the little bee worker, create this extra tension and the rest is just like that. The scene of the fire is completely in line with his work in \"children of men\" with camera shifting from different points of foci in the same frame. All this is probably well crafted, and different from Hollywood, but doesn't inspire any beauty or even elicit any form of intellectual reflection.It's better than Gravity, but that doesn't say much!",

I'll admit that the film's stunning black-and-white cinematography is exquisite and that the scenes introducing the picture's final act are emotionally mesmerizing (or maybe it's just that I was glad that something interesting was finally happening on the screen). Unfortunately, those are about the only redeeming qualities this release has to offer. The rest is a big, bloated, underdeveloped bore that tries the patience of even the most tolerant cinephile. It's obvious this was a heartfelt project for director Alfonso Cuaron, and his personal passion is written all over it. But, given that he's dealing with uninteresting characters in largely unexplained circumstances in a time frame for which little to no context or back story is provided, he's not giving the audience much to work with other than a glib implication that essentially says \"This is authentic -- just trust me on this.\" Also, the picture's anemic attempts at incorporating philosophical and metaphysical themes show the filmmaker's got some brushing up to do in terms of effectively conveying his meaning in a comprehensible way. If you're willing to risk the time watching this, be sure to pack a pillow and a lunch.",

It's amongst the most gorgeously shot black and white films on record, which is all the more impressive considering Alfonso Cuarón serves as the film's writer, director, AND cinematographer.  There's also no distinguishing between fiction and reality.  In particular, the actors in the movie make this slice-of-life film feel like it's a biography.  And finally, if 'Roma' indeed goes on to win the Oscar for Best Picture--right now it's certainly a contender--it'll eventually be saddled with the reputation of being undeserving of the honor, much like 'Crash' or 'Shakespeare In Love.'The bottom line is that no matter how vividly shot a picture may be  (*cough cough* Terrence Malick), without an engaging plot, everything else is just cinematic masturbation.  Lastly, a point of privilege: one reviewer fawned over Alfonso Cuarón's camerawork, setting expectations rather high.  However, while a number of sequences are indeed wonderfully shot, basic left-to-right or right-to-left pans aren't exactly innovative.  For comparison, watch 'Shoplifters' while paying special attention to camera placement and movement.  It's nothing short of extraordinary and likely the best camera work of any film this year.",

It is a tribute to women - Cleo, the protagonist, but also all who prominently appear:  The other housekeeper, Adela, as well as the two patrician women in the household (though they are flawed, they are kind and loving overall), right down to the female obstetrician.  On the other hand, we have the men who abandon them and their families; the shooters;  the posers like Fermin who show off to a point that becomes downright ridiculous (you will remember that scene); the ones in military bands who march through the streets for no apparent reason at all ... and who of course are flying the planes that intersect the sky throughout.  In the big martial arts demonstration in the field, who among them is able to execute the pose demonstrated by the teacher?  The martial arts students are all falling over, while (did I see this wrong?  The movie begs repeat viewings) isn't it Cleo, among the women on the sidelines watching all this, who pulls it off?  Is there one likable male character here at all?The ultimate message I got was that it is women who know how to love, while men are absorbed in themselves, to the point of disruption, and the most profound effect of this disparity is on the children.  Women save and nurture while men work against them. The betrayed and abandoned wife says bluntly that women are always alone.  Here, they are in one sense - that men disrespect them and/or fail to even stick around; but the women actually aren't alone.  It's love that binds them to each other, and to the children who could not thrive without them.  What an homage to the women who made Cuaron such a sensitive director, and an exception to his gender (as he sees it) in doing so.",

The film grabs you from the first frame, and doesn’t let you go until the end of its 2:15 run time. Cuarón’s mastery of the camera is evident in scene. Every shot contains so much painstaking detail; you can’t help but feel the passion and commitment that went into this project. Roma, is the story of Cleo who works as a maid for a middle class family in the 1970s. The film documents a year in her life.\tBefore I discuss anything else, let me heap more praise onto what Cuarón did. To take these childhood experiences, and recreate them in such a loving way is something truly special. The writing in this film is simple yet moving. The film really made me care about, and connect with the character of Cleo. Cuarón’s cinematography is something to marvel at as well. Each shot is beautifully presented, and the lighting is top notch all the way through. I could go on about how great the camera work is, but I won’t. Just know it’s something special and go experience it.\tThe performances are all strong. Particularly those of Cleo and Sofía, played by Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira. Both embody the strong female figures that become the focus of the film. Aparicio as a first time actress is particularly impressive, she delivers a powerful performance full of emotion. The acting nominations for these two, were well deserved.\tRoma is a masterpiece. It is the culmination of all the work Alfonso Cuarón has put in throughout his career. I was skeptical going in (mostly due to the fact that it’s a Netflix movie) but I loved every second of it. This movie is a victory for foreign film makers everywhere. It’s a shame the Academy didn't pick Roma as ‘best picture’, because it deserved it more than any of the other nominees. Regardless, Roma is exceptional in every sense of the word and deserves to be experienced by anyone who appreciates the art of cinema. 10/10",

This is a film not a movie. There are many situations and moments inserted that are a bit strange and memorable.The unfortunate: There is almost no character development, and no certainly no arc to the story. As the film advances the story of the wife becomes important, but she oddly is left as a peripheral character. You come away without any insight into the main character, she is almost always an onlooker with little revealed.The bad: For a film shot in black and white, it was flat- no deep blacks, and an overly warm grey palette. The cinematography was usually wide angle, which means no close-ups of faces and eyes, contributing to the visual lack of character development. It felt like the Director had a check-list of scenes drawn from mostly Italian and Italian Neo-Realism films. So while the film did not seem superficial, the effort was in the end more of a style exercise than emotional storytelling. I give it an 8 because movies today are so dreadful.

I understand that this film won't appeal to every single viewer's sensibilities, but I am just incredibly surprised/entertained at some of the commenters who seek to dilute this film to nothing more than a fluff piece about the importance of maids. If one were to do a simple google search (I know, imagine having the gall to do something so simple!), they would know that Roma is a district in D.F. and not some highbrow reference or attempt at being avant-garde. Based on the first user review here, it's almost like asking \"how DARE a filmmaker give insight into a piece of history/their own past and how it factored into the greater societal conflicts of the time????\" I suppose we should only tell stories of westernized families who mostly resemble our own, correct? Or even better, how about we simply disregard every history book and biographical novel who explains a worldview/experience different from our own! The fact that some reviewers have the audacity to call Cleo a \"weak\" character reveals a failure to understand the ever fluctuating nature of a family's dynamics. There is no inherent hierarchy in Roma's family, as the familial roles ebb and flow based on the unexpected internal and external situations the family find themselves in. Losing one family member often translates to the rest of the family taking on new or unfamiliar roles and responsibilities. The long-term identity of a family (and ultimately, the values and identities of its children) is based on the members who become solidified in that family over several years. It's not about who the family started out with, it's about the members who stayed and formed the foundation. I wasn't aware that a film seeking to express and reflect on the development of a child's memory (Cuaron's own) would be considered \"high-brow.\"",

Mumbling the mundane lifestyle of a maid in a mellow vocab, Cuaron has made his best film to date. First thing's first, the notable and yes loudTo Practice For Perfection.RomaCuaron's jaunting stay is frankly too practical to handle. Mumbling the mundane lifestyle of a maid in a mellow vocab, Cuaron has made his best film to date. First thing's first, the notable and yes loud cinematography of his is hauntingly beautiful. No one ever points out the facts that goes behind the camera on screen like such and even though it eerily resonates with Anderson's symmetric camera work, it is a testament of its own for he himself was never able to speak effervescently like such. Speaking of it, there barely resides a stable conversation in here, the bickerings, the murmurings, the gossip, every bit of narration is piled under such pragmatic state of environment. Cuaron speaks through body language and physical sequences, to a point where they themselves become a character.The sequence of a car being parked is so absorbing to encounter it on screen, which then enfolds into another layer of perspective to its intention and then another and then another. Cuaron keeps giving you reason- nay- he challenges you to get disengaged from this humble imbalanced world. And the host that he has selected to narrate this saga is a pure delight on terms of character development. Surprisingly, to write such a character is a daunting task. For its persistency ought to be justified and he does it in here as a mere distraction; kudos to him.Each time the protagonist is helping the younger ones or her employers, Cuaron subconsciously maps out another milestone in your mind. The stillness of a scene staged in a room puts you right there on the spot among the actors, where you have to work your way through to concentrate the gossip or sort out the primary activity in a frame. Amongst many steps that constructs this ingenious behemoth monument called drama, personally that speaks to you is the sort-of-training-camp where Cuaron speaks honestly of his theme without any strings attached.The cast has done a fabulous work, from the lead Aparicio as a humble supporter of this family and Tavira as the real supporter of Aparicio, along with the young cast which may resemble to the younger cast of Malick's The Tree Of Life. But Cuaron's dish is not spiced up with plethora of ingredients like Malick's, his sweetness is competent enough to tick for its course. Cuaron's span spent upon screen is a mesmerizing poem weaved out to clean and scrub a house properly.And boy what a poem it is, dipped into a metaphorical tone, it soars just like those planes hovering around in the background. For the most part of it, Cuaron keeps the frame under the shades, teasing us to seek for the action going on and similar to it the storytelling too feeds on our imagination that is at brisk all the time, especially the last act that scares you with the closure that you are trying to achieve. Roma narrows down cinema to a better quality, Cuaron makes sure it isn't compromised for any reason whatsoever, not even for him.",

Its premise its simple. It focuses on a middle-class family in Mexico City during the early 1970's. Yet for all its bitter-sweet humanity, the film feels slightly disconnected by having the potential of nearly every single scene absorbed by this prism of technical and visual marvel. Sure, it looks good, the atmosphere is present, but this mask, as nice as it might be, its too thick and often the film feels like a family slideshow. Its beautiful, but you do not really want to sit through it.Alright, maybe not that bad. There are many scenes containing true emotional weight. The one in which the chaos on the streets breaks free, but more than that, the scene in which Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) gives birth to her firstborn. That scene is presented with a personal purity which could have been this film's mark to greatness. The camera stays fixated, there is a sense of suppressed emergency and for the first time in nearly two hours, I felt truly connected. Not soon enough though, the film goes back to its habits.Fortunately, this still is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. The Mexican new-wave directors really have a gift for presentation and an unmatched skill of polish when it comes to cinematography and editing. I also feel like mentioning Aparicio, who is a first-time actress at this point. She managed to hold her own as the lonely, troubled but loving maid.In the end, I believe 'Roma' is more of a personal vision and nostalgic release for Cuarón rather than a traditional film. All this production, art-decoration, cinematography and editing is stunning to behold, too bad its such a thick emotional filter.",

It is not for lack of plot; a lot happens to Cleo and the family for which she works.  It is a misplaced focus.  There is an enormous amount of screen time given to bands marching down the street and to street musicians, with whom the characters show no notice.  There are numerous long shots of the courtyard, where you are left with counting how many piles of dog poop are there today. Only in a couple of scenes does anyone interact with the poop.  There are numerous scenes of being careful not to let the dog out or to run after it, but in only one scene does anyone interact with the dog.  There are scenes of the children playing and fighting that have nothing to do with the plot.  When something dramatic does happen, all the emotion is drained out of the scene.  It's like watching staged figurines covered in bubble wrap.  It takes a skill to film scenes like a deadly riot, a stillbirth and a near drowning and leave the audience unmoved.  Cleo manages to deliver the line about not wanting the baby to be born as if she's reading a news report.  Was she ashamed, relieved, guilty?  We'll never know.  It's one thing to portray a stoic character, but that's not what is going on here.  She seems robotic at the most dramatic times; she could show some emotion on her face and the director could capture that.Frankly, part of me was hoping Cleo would drown saving the kids as I was so incredibly tired of watching her character and it might bring the film to a close sooner.I kept watching the film to the end, hoping it would improve, but it never did.

That forgotten class that exists and struggles inside the Latin American country. Only a Mexican will identify the nostalgia of playing with hail during the rainy season or the stress posed by an incoming earthquake. Only a Mexican will remember the authoritarian rule of the PRI and the student repression ordered by the government. With long and depressing shots -such as everydayness- Cuarón portrays wonderfully the life of the domestic service in Mexico. Moreover, he plays with the nostalgia of daily life in Mexico City before the overpopulation of the incoming decades. A time long yearned by the old citizens of the largest metropolis in the Western Hemisphere. Peculiarly, most criticism to Roma is drawn by people who do not understand the dynamic of Mexican life. Cuarón's family is not a wealthy one, they can afford domestic service because one of the tragedies of the Latin American country is precisely the wages of this cruel benefit. Moreover, most of the people engaged in this servitude comes precisely from the largely marginalized indigenous communities of Southern Mexico. Roma is a must-see. Not only to appreciate another facet of the neighbor to the south but to understand that injustice is present in every social stratum.",

But then you notice how everyone interacts with Cleo, and how in many ways Cleo is central to the family, yet she's ignored and always in the background taking care of them. The audience realizes that Cleo takes care of the bigger day-to-day family life duties that both parents are neglecting. Cleo tries to have her own life, but it fails in the worst way. Cleo is afraid of losing her job, but receives comfort and understanding from the family without judgment instead. It is the final incident when the entire family realizes what Cleo is to them. That's when Cleo can finally admit to them what she's been truly feeling and that's what causes the family to grow together. I hope these independent movies continue to grow because I'm really tried of seeing studio films where it's just one physical fight after another using special effects. The true battles in life are what's within us, and movies can help teach us how to make lives better. In this case, appreciating the contributions of an indigenous woman, and no matter her station in life, how she helps the family in so many ways besides housework. The family give her a job and out of poverty, and she in turn gives back much more than that in emotional support and love.",

One of the beautiful and unique movies of 2018. Such an experience that after it was over, I struggled to utter a word. A masterful portrayal of joy, loss, betrayal, birth and heartbreak.I’m honestly flawed by this. I cherish these type of movies.I love the long tracking shots that lets the audience soak in the environment and scan every corner of the frame. The cinematography is so stunning and evocative, it implanted a image forever stuck in my mindset. Every frame is so carefully precise, I could make a picture frame out of them and hang up on a wall.None of it felt fake, just real and raw. Same thing with the performances from everyone. Yalitza Aparicio is absolutely fantastic in this movie. However, what surprised me is finding out that this is her first big role, because I, not for one second would have never guessed that. If you thought that was impressive, Aparicio was told at the last minute by Cuaron about the birth scene and how that escalates (without spoiling anything). This being her first role and given such a tricky task, which she effortlessly pulls off - it makes me question if there’s any point of going to drama school. Simply amazing.Alfonso Cuaron is a gift to cinema. The forest fire and beach scenes proves he’s the Tarkovsky of this generation.I won’t say no more. See it for yourself if you’re interested.Happy New Year everyone!",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nSPOILERS for Roma,so please check the movie out before reading the review!Alfonso Cuaron is an interesting filmmaker to discuss. Children Of Men was a “Story Setup Simmer” in a depressing future (until the 3rd Act),and Gravity taught me that the best experiences often don’t really need a story. Now with Roma (the new Netflix movie) he tackled something I wouldn’t expect (aside the technical aspect,but that’s for later): He made a movie that a director like Steve McQueen (Widows,Shame) would be proud.In fact,the screenplay takes a bit too much time to set up a situation,for example,and get away with it really fast,and the presentation of this family feels like a metropolis at home,especially for the main character we’re following throughout the whole picture,Cleo (played by Yalitza Aparicio). And the screenplay sets her up to be a presence...Until the last half of the 2nd Act,where,aside from her presence,the screenplay dumps everything onto the garbage bin (for example,her best friend ignores her only to go in a more menacing road,the baby of hers was born dead...I mean,it goes deep in a heartbeat),only for that to be an excuse so that the family she works for loves her (and,in context,it makes sense,given that this family got separated from their father,who was basically an imbecile during its screen-time). I mean,what I said feels like another A+ Steve McQueen movie: slow buildup to a situation,the fact we follow this person for the whole movie,the fact that sometimes it feels like a short.But that didn’t mean I was disappointed with the screenplay (as a whole),as the movie can be a great example of “Character Study”,since it sets Cleo up pretty fast instead of waiting 15-30 Minutes for a new character root. And it has a pretty emotional weight to it whenever it tries to take a break and let some characters breathe (when Cleo’s baby was considered dead,I was clenching my fists scared in the seat).Alright,now for the technical aspect… This may be the best use of Dolby Atmos+Vision in a movie this year. The use of Dolby Vision was perfect in every frame,as this is bound to be one of the few inspirations for my comicbook drawings (since I’m trying to approach a style almost like that),and also because it definitely feels like a fantastic Throwback Thursday to the golden days of Black and White Movies. And sound mix in Dolby Atmos is flawless in every detail. Sound always flows in every speaker,and it manages to get really intense without having one of those bass-thumping moments. This may be the closest thing to a true 360° Sound Field (what Atmos is made for). Also,pay attention,because sometimes the mix will drop an important piece of story when you’ll be looking at the fantastic cinematography.Look,I’m not saying Roma is bad or horrible as an Alfonso Cuaron movie,because there are some damn good things about it (and some inspirational ones,at times). Problem was just the fact that the screenplay was disappointing,because I didn’t expect such a grandiose screenplay that just feels like it’s in the wrong movie. Still,watch the movie. You’ll probably enjoy it better than me.But ending just like “Children Of Men” with a “Shantih Shantih Shantih” was an awesome touch to the end credits.",

But I prepare myself before watching a movie of this kind; simply because I usually don't find myself connected emotionally with these movies. And I was ready to watch one of these art-house movies that I appreciate from the artistic and technical standpoint more than truly enjoying them. But Roma really took me off guard. Because I found out that Cuarón took this artistic approach in making this movie just to tie the somewhat loose plot of an ordinary story into an emphatic and heart-wrenching force.Cuarón's audiovisual motifs find their way across the film, not for the sake of showing his masterful skills, but to represent metaphorically, or sometimes literally, the characters' feelings, characteristics, nature, express their relationships to each other, and to mark major turning points in the story. When he doesn't use metaphors, Caurón plays, literally, with the contrast between background and foreground, and therefore allowing us to witness the currently unfocused on characters. This give me an opportunity to experience what all characters feel at every moment, and not loosing touch with any one of them at all. Furthermore, this gave the movie some kind of vividness that elevated the experience of watching it even more.By doing so, Cuarón didn't just give us a phenomenal piece of cinema, but he also subverted the art-house film genre, and proved that films can be as technically flawless and outstanding as they are thoroughly accessible and absorbing.The first act is a combination of simplicity and innovative visual storytelling.The third act showcases Cuarón at the top of his visual craft, and that's when his signature long takes were prevalent, and each was as masterful as the last. But there's one in particular that sent chills down my spine, and kept me on the edge of my seat.The second act, however, is more artistically enthralling than emotionally. Flawless from the narrative and technical, of course, aspects, but it's more \"Arthouse\" and meditative than anything else. It has some of the most beautiful shots, and moments, of the movie, though. And I really can't say that the movie lost me even for a split second.The story isn't the most original thing you'll ever encounter. Actually, the characters arcs are quite familiar, but that doesn't take away even the slightest hint of greatness from this masterwork due to the completely unorthodox and refreshing ways the film narrated, structured, shot, and edited in. That said, I couldn't help notice the stereotypical character arc of Sra. Sofía (Marina de Tavira's character) at the end of the movie. Cleo, on the other hand, has enough genuine nuances and twists in her character arc that breathed new life into the character, let alone Yalitza Aparicio's spellbinding performance. Nevertheless, Marina de Tavira's committed performance is nothing short of stellar.I hope Roma will jump start a career for Yalitza Aparicio. I already knew that many critics praised her performance in this movie, claiming that she gave one of the best performances of the year, but I really didn't expect that her performance will fascinate me like it did. For as much as I admired Hamilton Morris's performance in Sweet Country, or Brady Jandreau's in The Rider, I appreciated them for their naturalism and authenticity more than anything else. But as for Yalitza Aparicio, I really can't make up my mind whether her performance or Emily Blunt's in A Quiet Place is the best performance by an actress I've seen this year so far. And the same goes with these two movies they starred in as well.Alfonso Cuarón doesn't go with the flow neither by giving priority to politics over anything else, nor by squandering his creative vision for the sake of making Hollywood cash-grab blockbusters. He stays true to his idiosyncratic vision, and faithful to his jaw-dropping trademarks. And here he is making yet another masterpiece that is captivating, poignant, personal and subversive all at once. And easily one of the most accessible art-house films ever made! Roma is a daring simple film.(9/10)",

I was watching another man's shockingly honest yet at the same time still rose-colored dream perspective of not only his own reality but that of those of a lower social class who helped raise him. All that being said, Cuaron can't help being who he is. This film is deserving of every accolade and award that it gets.",

It was a review of the daily life of a poor Mexican servant who got pregnant by a guy who left her the minute he found out about the pregnancy. This certainly has happened in poor southern rural places in America numerous timesIt just seems the director had to show this poor Mexican lady's life to make a underlying politcal point. It also didn't explain much about the political strife in Mexico at the time. That would have been nice. Overall , a good film but certainly not Pan's Labyrinth .",

This movie is great especially the photography that Cuarón did. First of all Cleo is a great protagonist, this movie just deals with the contemporary lives of the family she is there as a maid to witness it. The movie starts a little slow but when Cleo discovers that she is pregnant the movie starts to pick up the pace and just scene after scene is a wonder to behold. There is a scene during a protest that is just a marvelous thing to behold, there are dozens of extras on multiple biuldings and streets but the scene just comes out so good that you just keep thinking: ''How the **** did so many people ended up doing this and not a single mistake?''. The final moments of the movie are so great and something happens with Cleo that you cry with her. Cuarón did a good job telling his childhood stories, this movies just tell the story of a common family and you can relate to them, hell even I did. This is my favourite for the best movie category and the best movie that I saw from 2018.",

Although it’sIt’s a delicate perspective that teaches the value of letting the mind drive the body, much like Roberto Benigni’s Life is Beautiful. Except now, it’s told through the eyes of a woman with minimal outward emotion expressed. Although it’s first important to know that this otherwise tremendous film in fact has a pretty bad screenplay; Roma is simply not personal enough with what it’s like for a single mother, considering nothing really happens to her, the grandmother, or the kids. They’re all emotionally distanced enigmas who pretty much just stand there as plot devices, not human beings.Rather, the focus remains on the house maid, Cleo, whose mental state is shown to be crucial to success. Watching this production through her memory of serving this family has very intelligent establishments, even focusing in on a faucet dripping that connects back to Cleo’s shallow yet stern boyfriend using a shower rod for martial arts while he’s naked. Throughout these memories of a woman who only remembers the harsh, colorless moments as a maid, the creation of 1970’s Mexican culture is valuable for everyone to see. Inside the family’s walls, the television sets and cinema are both critical influences within this narrative. Outside the family’s walls, hail falls after a critical scene to pelt Cleo’s head until it melts into beads of sweat as she glistens during a stressful scene of labor.It will be easy to remember these seemingly unimportant moments because director Alfonso Cuarón (Children of Men, Gravity) knows personally how crucial the brain is, so immediately during the opening credits, he commands total control within the screen by lingering on floor tile that becomes flooded with soapy water, which reflects an airplane in the sky. It’s a unique, provocative image specifically designed to be remembered, especially since that floor tile in the narrow driveway becomes a character that gives Cleo enough reason to enjoy being dead… truly amazing how Cuarón can do that. In the narrow driveway, Cleo first sees the father of the family, as introduced by his car before any face is revealed. While it consequently means nobody in the film is easy to connect with like a new close friendship, the soul breaks through to spark the memory of how several young women would see their father during dark trials.Then Cuarón goes right from here to give information about the family through the young boys playing with guns, which seems like nothing at first, but carefully doses some foreshadowing toward an eventual street riot. Even when things get chaotic, Cuarón keeps quiet spectacle going louder than any James Bond movie, to the point when even the performances shine when the camera lingers on the details of the home. He doesn’t need all these closeups, but naturally keeps his actors on the same page as they make art out of the problematic script.The tone remains quiet as the camera very slowly pans through Cleo turning off all the lights downstairs before bed, which makes a powerful ocean moment near the very end permanently impressionable. Many scenes, especially that one, are all in one long take that allows the lush black and white imagery to test your eyes. In the end, the imagery goes beyond just being mere pixels on a screen—but the memories shared in the same way somebody in Cleo’s predicament would remember it, making you and her one in body and spirit. That doesn’t mean this movie is for everybody. In fact, if you’re looking for something relatable in the instantly approachable sense, then the screenplay written by Alfonso Cuarón will not help. Unlike what the final moments of the film suggest, the idea never gets across that Cleo was ever a real sincere part of the family she serves. While it’s verbally communicated satisfactorily, it has much more potential than the final product. There are no real personal moments between Cleo and each of the family members to give you a clear sense of what their individual relationships are like, nor are there real personal moments between the sons and daughter, like this film pretends are there. It ultimately results in an incorrect message that humanity just exists without an end goal, that people might as well be passive since nothing we do really matters.That henceforth categorizes Roma as a, “you either love it or you don’t” type of movie. That’s much what many of the old classics from the 1950s is like. For myself, after watching Roman Holiday, despite everyone calling it one of the greatest romantic comedies in history, I basically just went, “meh, now I can at least say I’ve seen it.” But there’s still an audience for it, as I know of an author in the UK who loves that movie! That’s how it will be for this film: If it doesn’t sound appealing, then you can look elsewhere for other experimental films that satisfy your taste buds.",

Directed and written by Alfonso Cuarón.The best thing about this movie, is the outstanding technical part for sure, there are so many fantastic things in this movie about this that i don't think that it is possible to put in words, it is so giant and amazing the job that they have done with immersion, this is probably one of the movies that i have felt more immersed while watching it from all, the movie is slow, but this happens for you to hear every little thing that is happening in that place, to see and feel every little small and single thing. The photography in here is also gorgeous, the camera movimentation is so sweet, is so not intrusive, it feels that you are there, watching from far away, the way that the camera is positioned in this film, so as it is moved, quietly and slowly, all of those things together allows you to almost smell the place.The choregography in some more agitated and with violence moments are also perfect, because you can't tell that there is one, everything feels so real, in a level that got scary.The story in this film is, for sure the biggest problem, so as the biggest differential in here, is definely what separate people that gonna love it and find it a disgrace. The thing about the story is that first, it is really real, real in way that everything could be happening inside of your own house, or with your neighbor, so it don't have a big narrative, plot twists, a big construction, it is really simple in a way that, as i said, could be happening to anyone. Another thing about this narrative, the director wanted to make us immerse a lot in this film, wich worked 100%, but in other hand to do it so he had to use some time in order to let us feel the place, a lot of time is in simple things, like Cleo cleaning, or th owners of the house parking the car in the garage, so there a lot of time in really small things, that can make in some moments you get tired, but it works perfectly in the immersion aspect. The narrative overall being so slow does bothered me, in some moments i started having my mind somewhere else, but in others the realism really cought me, fascinated me how that could literally happening in next door.The story does have different layers and aspects, it talks about the social difference between Cleo and the people that lives in that house, how do they treat her, and how her life is. There is the political aspect of Mexico at that time, with a lot of fights, war and death, moments that shocked a lot. And of course there is the way that Cleo sees all of that.This is movie for me to be rewatched and get more and more, understand more and more what Cuarón was telling.This is a story with a lot metaphors, one of the most real stories around there, really remarkable moments and scenes that i would say that  already are in the history of movies.",

Every actor and actress even the kids were fantastic, maybe because of the script (It's generally very real like actual people would say).Please watch this film.
