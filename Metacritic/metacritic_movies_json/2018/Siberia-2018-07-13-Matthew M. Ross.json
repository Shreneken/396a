  "summary": "When a business deal in Russia goes south, a U.S. diamond merchant (Keanu Reeves) and his lover (Ana Ularu) are caught in a lethal crossfire between the buyer and federal intelligence service.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Siberia is effectively well-paced, offers instances of tension, and doesn’t cheat at the end.",
    "There’s nothing particularly special about Siberia, but with a winning Keanu Reeves performance, it maintains enough moment-to-moment suspense that it just might be enough to satisfy moviegoers yearning for a throwback genre film.",
    "The reason to see Siberia is, quite simply, the presence of Keanu Reeves.",
    "The plot swerves around just enough to make you think something more complex is going on. Ultimately, it really isn’t — certainly not enough to make up for the clichés and sexist tropes that litter Lucas’ path toward a confrontation with the bad guys.",
    "The result is a dull and deeply compromised movie that would rather be a mediocre crime saga than a nuanced character study, but can’t quite bring itself to commit to that choice.",
    "A dour, plodding experience that's cold in every sense.",
    "Despite its pro-forma nature, the setup for Siberia — a lone hero in over his head in an unfamiliar world — actually starts out well but refuses to play out in satisfying ways.",
    "Siberia slogs along like the failed pilot for a poorly-thought out cable series, one with Eastern European development incentives but without enough drama, incident, intrigue or plot to justify its running time.",
    "In the end, it can never decide what kind of film it wants to be, drifting into drab formlessness when it needs to find moments of poetry, and reverting to dull clichés when it wants to indulge its thriller instincts, winding up as frosty and uninviting as its setting.",
    "Stiffly scripted and stoically directed, Siberia shamelessly squanders the particular appeal of its charismatic lead and wastes an inordinate amount of screen time going practically nowhere, except undoubtedly right to VOD.",
    "[A] leaden thriller.",
    "This movie so badly wants to be a sexy thriller, but it is neither sexy nor thrilling.",
    "Director Matthew Ross does the near-impossible in Siberia: He turns a Keanu Reeves vehicle about sex, diamonds and the Russian mob into a dreary, endless slog.",
    "Everything is tenuous, including a performance by Keanu Reeves that borders on catatonia. Just because he stopped shaving doesn’t mean he can suddenly act.",
    "The film has the tone and look of a direct-to-video feature, and some shots of Keanu Reeves are so waxen that the actor almost looks rotoscoped."

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThe movie has based on very intresting character – Lucas Hill – diamond expert. This man, on first sig look – has perfe tly evaluation of jewels, but has strange ethical , scale of value when comes to talk about wemen and Love. Here we see how he, at the beginig, heas fall in love with the charmy Katya, but in away, which you can call it passiv.   She makes first step, offering to him, she. gives him a ride with her car, she wears his hiden diamond in a candle. He does not gift her even a soup, little with aromas, instead he ask her what she whants, he can  take iniatiative , to  the man, to lead.\tVery strange thing happens, when he has been asked-pushed to swing his love-friend-Katya-with the one of the businessman. Volkov just for one bjob each. Which is an act of becoming brothers, mnow they are ”blood brothers” . Their trust asre raised, they earn confidance, but on expense of love.\tThis act shows the moral, the character of Lucas – he can`t defend his lovegirls. He is down on the strean of river, he does not take any atction to move up. The giuilt is always on the Pyoter – the problems with diamond is bbecause of him, the whole movie.,Lucs run from responsilility, hopin that something will phappens. Indeedd he does not run, he is sinks, regardeess of the warning of Vinsens – the South African.\tTMetaforicly Lukas lookson the women like a beautifull, “the best you ever 3ee”- diamonds. Katya – with taft charatucter , forward and beautifull,  “unalterable”  reminds him , associates , pull a string deep in the soul of Lucas Hill. Which. is already forgot what is love – he is only old firriend with his wife – they look squint away certain things. It is shown a little bit of their relation ship, but plenty to understand.-Lucas can`t get enough from his wife\tBut when he finds the love, he is timid , he keeps Katya professionally, like the same way, he does not sacriface anything for her. Can we exchange the love like a. diamond jewelyy – for a wile , let`s our partner try it and then return it to us ?\tThe women are not jewelas, but Lukes treats them as such, he cant fin. inner forces. to fight., to go out of the river that gooes to the waterfall-fateful. for him, He doesn`t go against even once, he doesn`t fight for what he whants\tOfcourse Keanu Reeves do this movie on purpose, he build the character of lucas Hill like an opposite of Jhon Wick – who kills and fight. even. for. the puppy. left by his belovveed wife. Jhon Wick has will, Lucas Hill does`nt have ome\tThe opposition of these two heroes, th two types of men is tryuly significant. Mr Reeves has proved., not once , that he is capable of self-deception in the mane of art and cinema playing roles of “weak”man – “Knock, Knock”, ”The Whole Truth”. It is amazing the range of the actor., he can be super hero – Neo , or to be manfailuure – in this movie. The question is : Are the viewers wants , are they accept him like a lozer. Because, as it is known, Keanu is one of the favorities of the crowd. People loves to wattch. him.; how he fights, struggle do stun real stunt work mmostly wwithout a. double.\tHere comes the geniius move of this man. You see – your. hero, beloved actor , is in a blind alley, he is pushed , but dan`t do anything. You begi  start to askyourself – why he does not run, why he does`nt. shoot them, why he doesn’t. do anythin for God, Please! Now you think, what I want should would do , if I mm on his place. This is it , This is the point of . Keany and dhedirector- to put you on  the place of main hero – to feel with him . To feel that you want to fight for your love. What you gonna do, if you were on my pplace , ask Keany with this movie.",

Instead it's Keanu in a more reserved and boring Wick persona venturing around a bleak Siberian environment of rich Russian mobsters and a very annoying sex crazed Russian woman that is unconvincing. The plot drags around and really is cliche as they come with stolen diamonds and blown mobster kingpin deals with utterly banal dialogue. The ending comes abruptly with no real conclusion and the film is over. While Keanu delivers his signature acting style that's servacable for the most part, there's really no reason to watch this. It's essentially John Wick on a depressing vacation without any action or excitement Obsessed with a Russian chick.",
