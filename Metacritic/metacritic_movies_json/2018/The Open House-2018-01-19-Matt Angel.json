About thirty minutes into the movie, I found myself looking for something to do to keep me entertained because it was a lot of terrible dialog with nothing happening.  I then attempted to force myself to focus on the movie (an action which I know regret) only to get even more terrible dialog with nothing happening.  I think this was supposed to fall under the horror or suspense category but at no point did I find the movie scary or care enough to feel suspense, and that's the worst sin here, I didn't feel anything, especially entertained.

A new unsuspected family that basically gets, well you know what for no reason? And what happened to the mother? Um... That was a little much.
