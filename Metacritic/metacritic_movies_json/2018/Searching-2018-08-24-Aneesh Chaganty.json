  "critic_reviews": [
    "For a film where every single scene is rigidly contained within a screen — framed by an iPhone FaceTime chat, a laptop exchange, TV image, home movie or security camera surveillance — Searching has a surprising sense of momentum.",
    "Searching isn't just a gimmick movie. It delivers the goods.",
    "Cutting to the emotional core of what social media says about us, the result is as much a time capsule of our relationship to (and reliance upon) modern technology as it is a cutting-edge digital thriller.",
    "Search is shockingly effective, not just in creating a sense of constant, palpable tension, but also in the way it pulls off authentic, effective emotional beats.",
    "Chaganty and co-writer Sev Ohanian refrained from facilitating a cautionary tale centered on the unspeakable dangers that lie ahead with every click. Their approach concentrates on experiences that are collectively understood in relation to modern artifacts and how they transform our codes of conduct.",
    "Despite the specificity of its story and the manner in which its told, the issues at hand remain universal, including David’s struggle to connect with his child and the way paranoia can make even the best friends into the worst enemies.",
    "Chaganty and co-writer Sev Ohanian deliver wonders on both the technical and narrative ends of Search, but editors Will Merrick and Nick Johnson do an astounding job as well.",
    "The smart visual trickery lifts what might otherwise have been a fairly conventional thriller, but it also lets Chaganty say some interesting things about our online lives. Technophobes should stay away.",
    "Searching is a thriller with a gimmick. The entire story takes place on screens — we see the action play out on devices like laptops and phones. But the movie never feels gimmicky, which is perhaps the neatest feat achieved by first-time director Aneesh Chaganty.",
    "Thematically relevant and persistently moving the form forward, Searching is an emotional roller coaster, taking a familiar premise and invigorating it along with biting commentary on viral video culture.",
    "See it, then go home and wipe your hard drive.",
    "Searching is a technical marvel with a beating heart at its core, which makes all the difference.",
    "Impressively, first-time filmmaker and former Google commercials creator Aneesh Chaganty has also made a real movie, the story of a family that morphs into a crime drama that gradually ratchets up the tension as all good thrillers must, one that’s well constructed and acted as well as novel in its storytelling techniques.",
    "Surprisingly effective for what could easily be labeled a “gimmick film,” Chaganty’s debut feature suspenser unfolds entirely onscreen on screens.",
    "Searching has a big performance and a big gimmick, and it’s hard to say which is the bigger discovery.",
    "A taut, effectively paced mystery-thriller with a powerful emotional component",
    "A clever twist-and-turn thriller.",
    "It aims for and earns genuine emotion rather than cheap thrills.",
    "As a thriller, Searching is both ruthlessly absorbing in the moment and relatively disposable as soon as it ends, sliding itself gracefully into the desktop recycling bin.",
    "As the style begins to wear out its welcome, the promise of a resolution and nifty twist keep things nimble. Like a well-crafted paperback, Search never commits the cardinal sin of being boring.",
    "Searching is a clever update on a housebound Hitchcock thriller like Rear Window, one that can make a series of Google searches play out like a high-wire action scene.",
    "Searching is nothing if not ambitious, and its rapidly accelerating second half is jammed with bold twists, red herrings and breathless confrontations. It’s also here that the movie begins to slacken its grip — partly because some of the twists beggar belief, and partly because they strain the limits of the online-all-the-time interface.",
    "Though Searching is a fun ride, I left disappointed over how little the film uses its digital schtick to unpack the psychology behind our modern screen addiction.",
    "If Searching prefers to focus on plot mechanics over emotion, it at least makes up for it with minor but significant developments in Asian American representation. Given the predominance of the cultural and generational gap between parents and children in Asian American narratives, from \"The Joy Luck Club\" to \"Master of None,\" it’s refreshing to see an example of assimilated families, whose numbers will only continue to increase.",
    "The combination of clever concept reflecting the prevalence of screens in everyday life, and the pleasure of watching a typically underused Mr. Cho take on a meaty lead role make Searching a satisfying psychological thriller.",
    "The movie’s arresting visual conceit has enough flexibility to sustain interest, even if the story’s twists and turns sometimes feel excessively fiendish.",
    "The end is too much like a “You may have already won” come-on, a poker game where the other player is using a 56 card deck, when you’re still counting on 52...A cheat, in other words.",
    "Like most mysteries, this one relies heavily on coincidental discoveries, even if they arrive via Gmail or FaceTime, rather than more traditional means. But the plot’s contrivances are less problematic than the movie’s insistence on maintaining its artifice even after it becomes a hindrance.",
    "As nimble as Aneesh Chaganty is in presenting his main character's multi-faceted interaction with technology in the first hour, the film suddenly morphs into a generic and manipulative missing-person thriller.",
    "Chaganty’s tab-toggling is pacy enough, but he gets pedantic about tying up unfinished digital business, and Unfriended’s pulse-raising wildness is beyond him.",
    "The movie might work better if the psychological puzzle tucked inside it were more engaging or surprising. But as the pieces fall into place, in a clunky resolution, the story turns as flat as the screens that contain it.",
    "The film doesn’t understand what mode it wants to operate in; serious thriller with emotional stakes or contrived, cynical satire (a set piece around a Twitter hashtag seems to suggest the latter).",
    "Though the script by Chaganty and Sev Ohanian is taut and surprising, I’ve felt more absorbed in an episode of Murder, She Wrote than I did in this film, because, there, it’s story and performance that we’re invited to savor, not just tech and technique.",
    "Searching is so smart about how we interact with computers that it's surprising how lame it is about moviemaking basics like characters and plot."

Also, because this is a screen-based film (everything takes place on some kind of screen: computers, cell phones, etc.). This could be considered a gimmick (like Unfriended in 2015), but this has several things going for it. First, it's a well-written mystery that would work without the concept, but becomes even more interesting with it. The superb editing and innovative approaches to storytelling (plus Cho's performance) elevate this film into smart, creative thriller.",

How seemingly connective may our lives be with technology? What connotes depths of connection with furtherances of technology? In the film, documenting is a huge factor which is a habit that aids the recovering family though comes with emotional challenges for the documenter because the recordings are memories so easily and vividly accessible. Throughout the film, the emotional experiences are so visible through the actors; agony, concealment, conceit, deceit, depth, shallowness -  but so ingrained in the film as natural by the actors portraying these sentiments. What is character beyond the ever-present face of individuals receiving amplification because of modern technological developments? A subtle question I find in connection with the title and the development of the film is, what connection is anyone really searching for with so many different mediums available to connect with others? We're connecting in connecting on connecting through connecting with connecting, but - what's really flowing between humans that draws humans to be so? Each character in Searching has a reason for being in connection in their location physical or virtual; each character has their own path set and connecting becomes a very selective process heavily shown among the aspiring individuals in the film. Yet - there is an underlying connection in which everyone is shown in connection deeper than each of them might seem privately which proves that people care though with their own intentions - though I think even more so in recognition of a life and the meaning of the life in connection with their own.I think Searching is a really good film addressing some modern social concerns and I think the film's title is apt. I'll always be a fan of short films before feature length films. Writing a review about the film makes me ponder the last time I've read a mystery novel. Cyber security and virtual social networks are definitely matters for discussion. Safe environments, virtual or physical, improve social interactions. Tragedy is not the only thing that brings people together; I think tragedy makes people feel like they need to be more transparent about their connecting to ensure all connecting circuits are functioning properly so as to prevent any further tragedy. Yet, on paths towards improvement functioning parameters may always find positively-assisting  adjustments. Virtualities will always be checked by tangibles. Overall Grade: B+/A--K.D.If you're into Poetry and other bits of creativity, check out my Instagram: @Dufreshest.",

Later in the evening in an episode of “Ballers” there were sections of texts being exchanged. (An aside: television has to learn to fill the screen with a text so it can be read!)Today I saw the movie “Searchers” which, from beginning to end, takes place on computer screens, smart phones, face time chats, facebook, google, dozens of hook up sites, vblogs and anything that can be done on the social media sites of a desktop or laptop.The film opens with montages of David Kim (John Cho) and his wife Pamela (Sara Sohn) happily raising their daughter Margot (various actresses at different ages with Michelle La at the age of 16) until Pamela’s death from cancer. Through FaceTime chat between father and daughter we see they are very close and are adjusting as well as they can.Margot does have a habit of forgetting her job of taking out the garbage and David, jokingly, affectionately, sends her picture of the overflowing kitchen garbage can and she responds, apologizing, saying that she will take care of it the first thing when she gets home from school.Margot doesn’t make it home!Not wanting to give anything away, you know, spoilers, I’ll just say it becomes a mystery with the father going through everything on his daughter’s computer and phone to find her. There are a few red herrings but if you follow it closely and are good at solving mysteries you might get the answer.Along the way we meet Detective Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing) who is leading the investigation and has a teenage child of her own, David’s younger brother Peter (Joseph Lee) who is more laid back than the older brother, along with schoolmates, teachers, chat room friends and people who claim they knew Margot more than they did.The only deviation from the Internet and cell phone are a few television broadcasts but I was really surprised how easy it is to hack a website that you may think is so safe.“Searching” is a decent mystery thriller told in a different form which will hold your interest. John Cho is the center of most of the screen shots and holds your attention whether it is showing the feelings for his daughter, his mastery of today’s technology or showing the range of emotions going through him not knowing what happened to his daughter.",

Considering it is his first major motion picture,social media satire that it whips you with..SearchingChaganty's nail-biting thriller is a real gem on delivering the crisp and the current social media satire that it whips you with. Considering it is his first major motion picture, Chaganty is a force to be reckoned with. His obvious gravels that are hard to chew, in its initial stages, is so flamboyant in the latter ones, that you are happy to let them go by, as you are practically giddy up for more of the sweat drop precision that amps up the charge. It is very well and calculatively constructed structure that despite of having a newer territory to explore, still follows one's familiar textbook formula; Chaganty went safe on that section. To create an entire picture that is fixated on a screen and tell a story through it, as much as that idea is appealing, it also is immensely difficult to pull off, since even though the technology has come far enough to give you quite a range to explore in it, Chaganty does feel short handed at times, and finds himself straining a bit on screen which is something that should not have been visible to the viewers but unfortunately it actually is.The subjective procedure of the investigation might be rudimentary but is immensely entertaining and thoroughly enthralling to encounter. The real romance of Chaganty's is how he weaves out a character out of tiny notions and objects, to an extent that you start caring for that object or a piece of message that it is carrying. The antics installed in this crime drama is something to be learned from, not only are they a huge supportive base of the plotline but also essentially the heat of the soul.The narration is not only gripping and adaptive but layered and thought provoking, no matter how itchy the short stories might feel like, they are crucial to the plot points. Obviously, there isn't much range offered to the actors to factor in, still Cho is delivering all he can from his guts; he makes you care for him. The supporting cast is a similar victim of the concept as Cho is, there is very little and in bits and pieces for them to do in so much time. The crust of the feature that it surfs through which is also its distraction, is thoroughly gripping and the makers have equally invested their time and sweat into it to be as convincing as possible.So these little notions or piece of informations keep giving us hope whilst the real trick is happening somewhere else entirely. The makers also plays with you subconsciously where they impute various ideas and innuendos on the screen for us to look at it as clues while actually all it does is throw us back from the real game. It is a very smart tale retold with a fresher perspective than we usually get, it keeps you tangled in its search. Searching may not be path breaking on terms of storytelling but as far as technology and cinema is concerned they are walking in parallel in here.",

These moments appear sweet until his wife acquires lymphoma, her return home date delayed until finally getting deleted. Then before this thriller kicks off the thrills, the sound design first calms down the mood with a YouTube video of peaceful music that David plays. This creative choice implemented within the soundtrack works well to soothe before the storm. Then a screensaver fills up the entire frame to express time passage—a phone call alert pops up, the dad is asleep, and boom: his daughter, Margot, is gone.After the production crew ensures realism to a relative’s death, the far more private, personal side of it is shown instead of the outside assumption of what cancer is like. The haunts of the aftermath reveal themselves when David copies memories including Margot’s first day of school and her first piano lesson, once cheerful memories now too painful to relive. Other instantly relatable moments include his constant passive-aggressive reminders for Margot to empty the trash. This appears on FaceTime by the way, which controls all the personal interactions in this feature, a much closer to home way of communicating than a mere ordinary scene would have accomplished. You may not know one of your close friends or relatives copy his home tapes to his other private folders, as David does, but there are many similar unknown facts about people you know, as this film addresses. In fact, people nowadays may as well not have a concrete identity anymore, since in this fictional case file, no characters are actually ever seen, just pixelated versions of themselves adapted to fit the social platform.You easily comprehend David‘s guilt, thanks to the gradually escalating score, one that establishes danger when he sees some guy with a hookah commenting on Margot’s Instagram posts, including one eggplant emoji comment. Without the audio work, this would be just another account found on social media, yet concerning Margot’s unawareness of this guy’s suspected intentions; it turns truthful to how most sexual exploitation starts. Other tiny details express complete knowledge of youth culture from the committed screenwriters; during one conversation Margot has with a stranger online, she’s asked her favorite Pokémon; her answer is Uxie, a memory-eraser, the other says her favorite Pokémon is Kecleon, which changes color to disappear. Amazing how those two Pokémon choices fit perfectly what these two online interactors want to do to themselves!Although it’s essential to bring up that this is the first feature film of director Aneesh Chaganty, and although he put in a good effort, he’s still got room for improvement. If there’s anything this movie is merely decent at rather than tremendous at, it’s the rather overlooked world building possibilities from inside the restrictive rooms the FaceTime callers sit in. Not much is done to utilize the background elements to give crucial information about the characters, and the random use of color for the sets doesn’t generate enough claustrophobia. When the screen is not focused on the FaceTime calls, an apparent lack of mastery in this type of space resorts to cropping in on certain elements of a webpage, which extinguishes the feel of being on your own laptop this film clearly intends.Though despite those rather minor criticisms, genuine stress still leaves an impact by the familiar circumstances, including when Margot doesn’t answer her dad’s many texts. In another scenario, it could mean a delayed response, but here, it could be she ran away. Just his typing speed alone sparks the clear injustice, especially when revisiting the account of David’s dead wife, which hasn’t been logged onto for 694 days. That is why the montage in the beginning supports the emotional impact so well, because after given a chance to cry, you thus genuinely hope to see David get back all he has left.But there’s no predictability in his mission to find his daughter: once the direction seems easy to figure out, it changes suddenly and constantly until the tension concludes. The tension is all thanks to how the final edit mixes in news footage to resemble an FBI case file compilation, structured appropriately by co-writer Sev Ohanian (second feature film) so that you naturally want Margot to be found.To stop future crises like this one from happening again, parents and children likewise need to know what goes on with each other. Lack of availability can mark the difference between two crucial seconds, which means minorities nowadays should stop being so shut away from parents. Please do the same.",

Through family photos and videos, we get to see the Cho's family from the birth of Margot, the fun moments with her mom and dad, her learning the piano and the struggles of her mom as she battles cancer. \"Searching\" begs the question, \"How far will you go to protect a loved one?\"The dialogue in the script is believable as we watch David Kim struggles to understand his now teenage daughter, Margot who spends a lot of time by herself. He doesn't know her friends and when she goes missing, he realizes that there are a lot of things, he doesn't know about her. Questions like why she hadn't been to piano practice for 6 months even though he's been giving her $100 per practice session for her tutor. And why did she withdraw $1200 from her account before she went missing? Was she abducted or did she run away? To find the answers David Kim must break into her computer system and get her passwords for the sights she frequented. Debra Messing plays Detective Vick, who is helping David Kim investigate the case of his missing daughter. \"Searching\" shows the dangers of social media and it is a movie that parents should take their children to see. It also shows how insensitive people can be even in tragic situations.The film takes us on a journey of today's technology, but overlook the simple importance of a voicemail. It does, however, drag the audience in as we are with David Kim every step of the way. I give \"Searching 4 Stars out of 5 for its clever twists and turns.",

This is a really solid thriller with some dynamite twists and turns. And as for that aesthetic, I found it to be about 85% effective. As things get a little too big for the visual premise's proverbial britches, however, that's when I found myself checking out.

Gifting a pertinent, compelling final turn for anyone going to the cinema, this cyber-crime mystery-thriller is, besides the perfect vehicle to deliver a brilliant performance by the leading actor, an introspective, absorbing and effective offering that will delight followers of this emerging sub-genre.Director Chaganty fully knows the kind of story he wants to tell, therefore manages to get on the audience's nerves with a modern, uncomplicated verve that never finds in excess the answers it needs. Co-writing alongside Sev Ohanian, these two relatively novel screenwriters test their most inventive skills to assemble an electrifying, tech-influenced whodunit/whydunnit that faces a short crisis of cogency halfway through.Moreover, some comical punches are masterfully distributed throughout the first two acts, injecting into the story a vibe of freshness and levity never colliding with the in crescendo tension and the convincing drama.Slightly approached by some other films, it depicts adolescence with palpable veracity, avoiding teen-life problems as bullying or suicide to delve deep into introspection and media abuse by means of youthful characters that play the same stereotypes with relatable confidence, these teenagers belong entirely to our world, which helps considerably in the credibility the film seeks to reap. The script is the agent that better works for the idea thanks to the three-dimensional, kind-of grounded drama, never unbalanced towards melodrama or pastiche, always enriching the relationships between characters. Don't waste time waiting for the most buoyant revelation of the darkest youthful secrets nor hi-tech sequences with explicit violence, there is more well-aimed drama than breathtakingly intense suspense in this story about a fractured father-daughter relationship, the family life between mirrors gestated since a painful past event.The fact that a single actor holds the entire film together speaks volumes, indeed, says it all. John Cho, Hikaru Sulu in the rebooted \"Star Trek\" trilogy, is an actor who takes quite seriously his job, his latest true proof. He's not in front of the \"camera\" all the time, but still, the actor delivers a fantastic performance, rich in nuances, interchangeable in purpose. The \"FlashForward\" actor looks, and acts, as a fairly bona fide modern-day father who tries to get along with his reclusive daughter, neither slipping into over-the-top comedy nor verging on saccharine following the fascinating, heavy-hearted opening montage. His committed performance certainly strengthens the idea, getting we're worried and intrigued at once; his search, instinctively, is ours as well. Nine producers on board, it's hard to reckon how much money it costed, even with three production companies not entirely unknown overseas. Roughly speaking and based on conjectures, it might be slightly higher than \"Unfriended\"'s $1 million budget, its main reference. That being the case, Sony did not think twice about paying $5 million for its world rights at Sundance earlier this year; an investment that, thanks to the genre, the innovative setting and the raving critics coming out from the fests, will be easily recovered in the first week of release. A solid, understated editing work for this found-footage ramification is primal, therefore, the very same directors of virtual photography are editors here setting up one hour and forty-two minutes of clicks, pop-ups, chats, FaceTime video calls compelling because of the flowing, intriguing development the narrative seeks not to neglect. Torin Borrowdale's soundtrack conflates the sinister investigation-kind melodies and synthetic-yet-exciting sounds of artificiality, honoring its nature of virtual environment without fear.\"Searching\" by Aneesh Chaganty is not as wildly unpredictable nor is it original as many critics claim, it's a timely digital-era drama varnished with unexpected suspense gimmicks with enough strong suits to become a time-worthy, enjoyable experience for parents and teenagers alike, for viewers committed to scrutinizing under its taut virtual thriller layer. With a formidable performance by John Cho, an emotionally and strategically geared screenplay, a truly great direction which balances the mainstream and the indie, and a suitable soundtrack, this family drama set on screens has something to say, at least, up until before the third act.",

Admittedly there's not a whole lot of competition in this genre but compare it to the Unfriended franchise and Searching looks like a masterpiece.David Kim (John Cho) is in a strained relationship with his 16-year-old daughter. She goes missing and with the growing realisation that he doesn't know much about his own daughter and her friends he must break into her laptop to track her last known whereabouts in order to find her. It thankfully didn't take a turn into the ridiculous and use a ghostly computer glitch. Instead it takes an idea grounded in reality, using the real life fear of a parent not knowing their child's whereabouts and follows their struggle in possibly coming to terms with the worst. I liked the idea and it kept the tension, but for me the last act lets it down. Searching had about four different endings and decided to use all four and honestly I wasn't pushed on the last one, so at a certain point I was slightly concerned my eyes were going to roll into the back of my head because I just wasn't buying it anymore. Yet despite the unsatisfying ending Searching is worth checking out if you've nothing else to see. A decent thriller/mystery that you can sit back with your bucket of popcorn and enjoy. Recommended if you've seen everything else in the cinema.",

This wasThis film stars John Cho as a widowed man searching for his missing daughter. Everything is told through a computer screen, especially video chat, newsfeeds, and phone calls.When I saw the trailer to this, I was on the fence. This was basically the same gimmick used for the horror movie Unfriended. I was worried about how much more you can do with the format. Interestingly, these two films are from the same producer. Listened to a podcast interviewing him. He thinks that-first-person films are the wave of the future. Although, I don't know if this can survive long-term, I am so glad this was made. Unfriended actually proved to be the testing ground for this format. The technique is far more self-assured. Not once did things feel awkward. The opening montage, sort-of-an-equivalent to the opening of Up, is especially well done. The format really focuses on the little things, like how you understand the characters' views from stuff like hovering the cursor over an image or editing a message before they send it or and just miscellaneous comments on social media. Unlike Unfriended, this film utilizes background music. Fans of cinema verite may feel it pulls away from the experience, but I thought it really helped set the mood.The script is really good. The revelations, twists, set up, and pacing are all quite well-thought out.Acting is fine too. However, it is John Cho who carries the brunt of the film, and he absolutely nails it as a desperate father.Searching is a finely made mystery and offers something a little different. Highly recommended.",

Then there's the aesthetic design, with the entire film taking place online, the images presented taking the form of what is seen on computer screens, iPhones, security cameras etc. One of these principles is exceptionally well handled, the other isn't, and it shouldn't take a genius to guess which is which.Written by Aneesh Chaganty and Sev Ohanian, and directed by Chaganty, the film tells the story of Margot Kim (Michelle La) and her father, David (John Cho). Margot's mother Pamela (Sara Sohn) died several years previously, and Margot has since drifted apart from David, although he doesn't seem to have noticed. When Margot doesn't return home from a study group, David learns she cancelled her piano lessons six months prior, and the money he had been giving her for those lessons was instead being deposited into her bank account. Several weeks ago, the entirety was transferred to a now deactivated Venmo account. David reports her missing, with the case assigned to Det. Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing). However, as David and Vick begin to delve deeper into Margot's life, every investigative avenue seems to throw up another mystery, and as time passes, it begins to look more and more as if Margot has simply run away.The mise en scène of Searching is much more successful than the plot, with almost the entire film taking place on a computer screen, with Facetime conversations, iPhone messages, security camera footage, and TV material rounding out the design. The aesthetic is extremely well crafted; from Chaganty's direction to Juan Sebastian Baron's cinematography, to Nicholas D. Johnson and Will Merrick's editing; logistically, this can't have been an easy film to plan or shoot, and the fact that the various components that go into making up the final image all work so well together suggests a great degree of care.Within this, the filmmakers are even able to throw up a few surprises. For example, the structure grants us more access to David's interiority than would be possible in a regular film; on several occasions, David is shown typing something during a conversation, only to delete it, and send something completely different. Anyone who has spent any amount of time talking online or via text will be familiar with this, and the use of it in the film allows us a glance into his psyche, showing us where his mind is in an unfiltered sense, before self-censorship kicks in. It only happens a few times (if it happened too much, it would become meaningless), but it really does impart a degree of psychological verisimilitude.Chaganty himself is a former Google Creative Lab employee, so he would know a thing or two about issues such as the uses and over-uses of technology, the unpleasant side of online culture, and the notion of digital footprints, and it is these areas where most of the film's more salient points are concentrated. For example, the addiction to technology and social media so prevalent in today's culture is right there in the set-up - the entire Kim family are obsessed with speaking to one another via phones and computers, and recording pretty much everything. Another subject is the toxicity of the internet, the prevalence of online troll culture, and the tendency for people to say things online that they never would in person, believing that the anonymity afforded by the internet gives them the right to be unpleasant. This is communicated primarily through one scene - after watching a news report about Margot on YouTube, David begins reading the comments, which almost immediately start making jokes about him having killed her, and being \"father of the year\".The impossibility of ever being invisible online is another topic. Yes, the film is about a person who had an entire online existence that no one knew about, but that was only because no one had looked. Once someone did, and once a few threads were pulled, everything is exposed, as the impossibility of erasing ones digital footprint becomes central to the story. Anyone who has spent any amount of time online will be familiar with many of these issues, and the fact that they all ring so true, without the film becoming preachy, is a testament to the quality of the film-making.Finally, and this cannot be overemphasised, the film includes a pitch-perfect, perfectly timed, perfectly delivered Justin Bieber joke that is absolutely hilarious, and has to be seen to be appreciated.",

Let me tell you, Searching was the best thing I didn't know existed since I discovered Trader Joe's cookie butter. I was skeptical with the seemingly boring premise of \"Dad uses internet to find missing daughter,\" but the plot came together nicely with a solid cast and characters with a twist that is doubtful anyone will see coming. Another thing done well is its interesting decision in going with the 4th person/POV style (a style typically not done well) in which everything you see is from the perspective of watching the dad's computer screen as he searches through his computer, FaceTimes his daughter, or as if you are watching a real-time view of a news story on tv.

ItI thought this was quite an intriguing film, in terms of making the viewer (particularly if its the younger generation) realise how much of our lives we may put online, whether that be behind a private, password-controlled account or not. It was an ironic film to watch at the time for me personally, as it just so happens I've decided the other day to make an effort not to be on social media as much as I used to be, as it has stressed me out and raised my anxieties a bit, particularly during this pandemic time (I'm typing this late Jan. 2021).Anyway, the film is good - perhaps a little slow but not entirely badly paced. Everything we see is shown via webcam video footage and we see the father, who only after a while realises his daughter appears to have disappeared, typing and trying his hardest to access said daughters accounts, on the search for any clues to her whereabouts. I felt I could empathise with the situation he was in, not knowing too much about his daughters' social circle. Certain aspects of the plot that unfold, I felt I could personally relate to. On the slightly techy side of things, I'd almost forgotten about tumblr and I hadn't heard of MyCast either but I have now! also, I was surprised at the start when the dad loads the PC as it clearly shows an old version of Windows - I think XP but certainly, pre-Windows 7. Given this film was apparently released in 2017, it seems a pretty dated system to be running but maybe that's just the geek in me speaking up there? its not entirely relevant to the film I suppose. Having said that, I did notice that when video calls were incoming, they would often be branded as FaceTime calls (i.e. video calls communicating through iPhones), which implies its set pretty much in the modern-day.The way the plot progresses isn't bad - there are frustrating moments and I saw things that made me wonder what had happened and all the rest of it but I'd say its a pretty low key kind of a film. Its thought-provoking in that it makes you think about how people and companies respond to certain situations. I won't say anymore so as not to provide spoilers but while I wouldn't say its an entirely amazing film as such overall, I thought it was quite good and certainly towards the end I did feel surprisingly gripped, so I would recommend it, yes.",
