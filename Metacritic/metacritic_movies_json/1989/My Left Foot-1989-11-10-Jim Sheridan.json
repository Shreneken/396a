  "summary": "True story of cerebral palsied Christy Brown, who overcame his illness and poverty to become an accomplished artist, poet and writer.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Daniel Day Lewis, Hugh O’Conor and director Jim Sheridan made damned sure that whatever Hollywood thought, whatever “rewarding a stunt performance ” rationale might enter in filmdom’s collective mind about this bit of work, their combined efforts would be never less than a wholly realized human being.",
    "My Left Foot is a great film for many reasons, but the most important is that it gives us such a complete picture of this man's life. It is not an inspirational movie, although it inspires. It is not a sympathetic movie, although it inspires sympathy. It is the story of a stubborn, difficult, blessed and gifted man who was dealt a bad hand, who played it brilliantly, and who left us some good books, some good paintings and the example of his courage.",
    "Throughout his life, Brown refused to give in to public convention or his own despair; he wouldn't play the victim. Brown labored to express all of his feelings, not just the acceptable ones. Day Lewis works the same way. My Left Foot, a keen match of actor and subject, stands as an eloquent tribute to the talents of both.",
    "My Left Foot is gloriously exultant and hilariously unexpected...Sheridan and his great young star have universalized their broken hero.",
    "A rich cinematic experience, this uplifting British production will leave you in awe of the extraordinary Christy Brown.",
    "That it features a brilliant performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and a fine supporting cast lifts it from mildly sentimental to excellent.",
    "Day Lewis' re-creation of writer/painter Christy Brown's condition is so precise, so detailed and so matter-of-fact that it transcends the carping about casting an actor without cerebral palsy. He couldn't have done it better.",
    "This one you see for the pure love of great movie making. Its tough-minded, unsentimental writing and ferociously brilliant acting--across the board and especially at the top--manage to give a pretty good idea of what Christy Brown, the Dublin-born writer, poet and painter, was all about.",
    "An intelligent, beautifully acted adaptation.",
    "Day-Lewis's performance is necessarily a bit showy—one has to strain at times to understand all his dialogue because of the character's contorted features—but he puts on a terrific drunk scene, and for all his character's travails the film as a whole winds up surprisingly upbeat.",
    "One hundred and six minutes is entirely too short a time span for Sheridan to cover Christy's entire life, but the performances are so profound they successfully fill in any and all gaps.",
    "A rounded portrayal that leaves an overwhelming sense of the miraculousness of life."

The writing isa writhing response to an imperishable question..My Left Foot: The Story Of Chris BrownThere are very few features that are known for its stand-out performance that has touched thousands of heart and this is one of them. The writing is compelling; even though of familiar structure that follows up the same rudimentary process that a usual biography does, but is still adaptive and exhilarating, especially when created a dramatic sequences that is not only poetic but rhymes too, to the tone of it which shows the passion and enthusiasm of the makers on telling the story. It may be short on technical aspects like sound department and editing, but surprisingly it barely factors in, as the audience finds itself in the awe of the performance, for the most of the time. Jim Sheridan; the screenwriter and director, is in his A game and brings out the best possible outcome in each and every frame of it. As mentioned earlier, there is no flinching on the excellence and hard work of Daniel Day Lewis's acting skills and his love towards the craft of it. My Left Foot: The Story Of Chris Brown is a writhing response to an imperishable question, not asked by the strangers residing in the society but the loved ones who too are any human than us.",

How did he go about doing all this? The film's title is a clear giveaway.",
