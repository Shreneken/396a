    "The Harrison Ford-Sean Connery father-and-son team gives Last Crusade unexpected emotional depth, reminding us that real film magic is not in special effects.",
    "Though it cannot regain the brash originality of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' in its own way 'The Last Crusade' is nearly as good, matching its audience's wildest hopes.",
    "It is just as well that Last Crusade will indeed be Indy's last film. It would be too sad to see the series grow old and thin, like the James Bond movies.",
    "Start lining up now, bring a bullwhip -- and maybe some d-Con. Indiana will do the rest.",
    "Despite strong acting (the slapstick energy between Ford and Connery is wasted), obligatory chases and stunts and splendid art direction, the virtuoso technique evident in every frame remains formulaic--unaccompanied by revelation, epiphany or surprise.",
    "The first of Spielberg's films to make us feel heavy in our seats, the first to leave us sitting, passive and uninvolved, on the outside. Watching it, you feel that nearly anyone could have directed it.",
    "Mechanical, soulless."

The addition of Connery to the cast (as Indy's father) is a nice touch, providing further insight into the character development, though it does seem to be pushed a bit past the limit at times.  Still, in a film-ic version of old serials, limits were made to be pushed.  There is not much time to relax during the entire running time, but I don't see that as a problem.  The humor (through both the Marcus Brody and Saliah characters, as well as the interplay between the Fords) is in just about the right proportion (again though, it does push the limits).  The storyline harkens back to the \"Raiders\" style, drawing on religious themes and including everyone's favorite bad guys:  Nazis.  It's flicks like this which go a long ways to atoning for past mistakes (re:  \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\").",

The Last Crusade improves on Temple of Doom while just lacking the brisk efficiency of Raiders. It looks fabulous and has a great music score. The script is deliciously witty especially with the interplay between Ford and Connery, and the story is engaging. The action is epic, and I liked the neat sequence at the beginning that explains things such as Indy's fear of snakes and how he got the scar on his chin. Steven Spielburg does an excellent job directing, while both Harrison Ford and Sean Connery(in a masterstroke of casting) are perfectly cast as Indy and Indy's father. On the whole, exciting, witty and fun. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

In his third (and what for years what thought to be his last) adventure, Indy is on the hunt for that ultimate treasure, the Holy Grail. Along the way he must contend with Nazis, a secret brotherhood and, of course, snakes. Sean Connery is a wonderful addition as Indy's father, and the chemistry between he and star Harrison Ford may just be one of the best in film history. The movie is a true rarity in that its attempts to outdo each preceding chase sequence succeed.

This time, Indy's dad joins the adventure, played by Sean Connery, and the chemistry between these two gives the movie a fantastic human center quite unique to the series. They find themselves on a quest to prevent the Nazis from acquiring the Holy Grail - and yeah, although this is essentially a rehash of the original, it's just so damn much fun that you simply don't care or even really notice. I'd seen films 1 and 3 several times before I suddenly realized how similar they were, and that's the impressive strength of \"Last Crusade\" - you get so caught up in everything with Indy and his dad, so swept up in spectacular chase sequences, that they could be after the Ark a second time and you still wouldn't care. \"Raiders\" may have established this traditional Indy formula, departed from only in the very different \"Temple of Doom\", but it is perfected and tied with a bow here in \"Last Crusade\". The music is at its best, the action is at its best, the characters are at their best, and of course Spielberg is at his best. It's a straight-up A-grade thrillride.",

Harrison Ford has always been charming and great in his movies. But his roles as the archeology professor with an appetite for adventures put viewers all over the world in excitement and contentment. Indiana Jones is without a doubt an unforgettable character. \"The Last Crusade\" is the third movie which on my opinion is the best. I've watched it countless times. The father - son relationship between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery (who plays his father) is remarkable. The wittiness, dangers situations and the funny commentaries from Ford and Connery makes this movie so much different, special and unique from the others. All that combined with the wonderful presence of the late Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies blasts the movie extremely high. Spielberg and Lucas did create a masterpiece which will outlive us and will always fascinate everyone.

The dynamic between Indianan Jones and his father (Sean Connery’s role) is some of the best (estranged)The best of the Indianan Jones movies. The addition of Sean Connery and River Phoenix alone is remarkable as both were great actors. The dynamic between Indianan Jones and his father (Sean Connery’s role) is some of the best (estranged) father / son relationships in movies. Then there is River Phoenix who is only used in the introduction scenes but it is one of the best introduction scenes in movie history and tells you everything that you need to know about Indiana Jones. Also praiseworthy Paul Maxwell role here as man with the panama hat (Don't know if he is even named in the movie). Short appearance but so memorable that everyone remembers him. But lets go back to the movie. After the legendary good introduction scene Indiana Jones is informed that his father is gone missing on his search for the Holy Grail. The Grail is his fathers lifelong obsession and Indiana Jones only goes on a journey to save his father as they have a rocky relationship and are a bit estranged. This is the beginning of a legendary adventure. The story is excellent and I do not see any flaws here. It has the right pacing and a good mix of action, humor, good twists and character development. I know I sound like a fan boy here but its one of the best performances from director Steven Spielberg, writer George Lucas and the whole team. Lets go to the actors. Harrison Ford is always great in his signature role (Even in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) and this is his best performance as Indiana Jones. I already praised Sean Connery and this is also one of his most remembered roles outside of James Bond. River Phoenix died far to young and would be possibly one of the most acclaimed actors in Hollywood today. Paul Maxwell shines in such a small role. John Rhys Davies and Denholm Elliot return to their roles and this improves this movie too. Both are fan favorites and well remembered characters too. They have again not the longest screentime but make a great performance. Then there are the antagonists I wont spoil here. All are excellent and enjoyable villains. This is such a great cast and an awesome performance. The script, actors and directing accomplish each other. This movie has so many memorable scenes be it the humorous (Non spoilery example: No tickets, the special “autograph” or the stamp joke), action scenes (No spoilers here) or character developments (Again no spoilers here). Again the sets and special effects are top notch and everything looks amazing and believable. Also again we got the famous and legendary John Williams for the score. He should have deserved more credits as he improved every movie where he made the score. Overall while there is no perfect movie this comes close. It became the gold standard for Indiana Jones movies and action adventures while also becoming a cult classic. I rewatch it once in a while because it is a movie you can enjoy again and again.",

This is the third movie in the franchise and the final movie in the original trilogy and follows Indy searching for the Holy Grail, accompanied by his father.I know that I've said this in every Indiana Jones review so far but Harrison Ford is still amazing as Indiana Jones with his charisma and intelligence making him such a likeable character. Sean Connery is also amazing as his father and they both share similar characteristics; intelligent, charismatic and daring. Their chemistry and the way they work together on screen is also great and they genuinely feel like father and son. What I also like about his character is that he doesn't feel slapped in and unnecessary just because they could have him in the movie and actually serves an important purpose to the story.I liked the side-characters of Sallah (who is back again from his first appearance in Raiders) and Marcus Brody as you could tell their characters weren't completely sure what they were getting into and had some quite goofy characteristics. However, this wasn't in an annoying way and instead added a much lighter tone to the story when it was required which helped give their characters a good reason to be there.There was definitely comedy in the previous two (well, maybe not as much in Temple of Doom) but in this film there are many more laughs than in the previous, many of the jokes coming from Indy's interactions with his father and that's another reason why I love this duo so much.The action is done very well like the other two films with great cinematography and lots of tension. I wouldn't say the action is as good as Raiders but it was certainly better than Temple of Doom.I prefer this one more than the others in the trilogy because it features a more personal story whereas in the others it was just a case of 'hey, let's go on an adventure'. What makes this one more personal is that it explores Indy's life much more by showing his younger days at the start and then obviously introducing his father which adds a lot more depth to the story.Overall, I loved this film. I liked it more than the other two because of its more personal story and more memorable characters. The action, while still great, isn't as good as Raiders but I found the great story and setting to be the highlight and stole the show for me. I would highly recommend this film, especially if you want to relieve yourself of the dark tone of Temple of Doom.8.5/10",

Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film has screenplay by Jeffrey Boam, and has Harrison Ford and Sean Connery in the lead roles.After the debacle of \"Temple of Doom\", this film intensified interest in the franchise and revive her success. In fact, the team formed by Ford and Connery is unstoppable and gives pleasure to see how professional is their interaction on screen. There are two established actors, Ford is very well suited with his role and Connery is a veteran with decades of experience and versatility. This clearly benefited the film, where these two artists outshines the rest of the cast, especially in humor moments, tearing laughter to the public. The script is good, all that \"Temple of Doom\" had to be and was not, recovering the vivacity and adventurous spirit that had been so intense in \"Raiders of Lost Ark\". The final sequences, filmed in one of the most stunning scenery I know - the Nabataean ruins of Petra in Jordan - are worthy of staying in memory of any movie lover. The photography is excellent, the visual and sound effects have great quality, some costumes were very well thought out and the soundtrack, not surprisingly, has fulfilled her role.It's no coincidence that there is a division on what is the best movie of this franchise: \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" or this one. There are some similarities between them, especially concerning the quality of final product. For me, if \"Raiders\" had a greater script and spirit of adventure, \"Last Crusade\" offset any fault with better humor, a stunning scenery and some breathtaking action scenes.",

Nobody understands adventure better than Spielberg and this movie is so purely adventurous and fun! The action sequences are better than most blockbusters made today despite this film being 30 years old and the finale is so adrenaline fueled and I loved it.

Outside of being known as James Bond, I personally believe this to be Sean Connery's greatest role outside of Bond -- and a high recommendation for anyone interested to view any of the films which depict the dangerous exploits of Indiana Jones.In terms of action, there are some great set pieces in this one including a boat chase through the canals of Venice and race to beat a tank much later in the film. Sound effects, especially punches and slaps, have never sounded as good as in this film; elevating the distinct brutal nature of this series further.Although I thoroughly enjoyed this film, I admittedly didn't like Indy's love interest in this one - she isn't as memorable as what we were given in previous entries. I also found her true motives to be confusing. This is a minor complaint regardless, and shouldn't distract from the great cinematic fun to be found within.In conclusion, a strong recommendation from me. Even if you're not into these sorts of epics, you'll be sure to find some levels of enjoyment out of the relationship between the two main leads. It's well-paced, witty, and doesn't take itself too seriously - which is what I believe Indiana Jones has always been about from the start.",
