  "critic_reviews": [
    "It's one of those ageless movies, like \"Casablanca\" or \"The Third Man,\" that improves with age. Some movies, even good ones, should only be seen once. When we know how they turn out, they've surrendered their mystery and appeal. Other movies can be viewed an indefinite number of times. Like great music, they improve with familiarity. It's a Wonderful Life falls in the second category.",
    "This couldn't be other than a Capra picture, the humanness of its story the dominant factor at every turn of situation. His direction of the individual characterizations delivered is also distinctively his, and the performances, from the starring roles of James Stewart and Donna Reed down to the smallest bit, are magnificent. When Capra is at his best, no one can top him.",
    "The film is gripping enough simply with the telling of George's lifestory. A genuine American classic.",
    "Whether you view this film in the middle of the summer or at Christmas, Capra's greatest film represents one of the most transcendent and joyful experiences any movie-lover can hope for.",
    "Although peppered with colourful, sharply drawn characters, this is Stewart's movie, instantly loveable as a small town dreamer who sacrifices everything for others. His journey to despair and back warms the cockles like little else. Enjoy it in a cinema so you can sob among others.",
    "Few filmmakers have rivaled director Frank Capra when it comes to examining the human heart, and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a masterfully crafted exercise in sentiment, augmented by Capra's undying faith in community. Reed and Barrymore give excellent performances, as does a superb cast of character players, but this is Stewart's film--heart-stirring as the dreamer who sacrifices all for his fellow man.",
    "The film’s bravura fantasy sequence, imagining the hellishly licentious Bedford Falls that would exist without George, makes the grandest possible case for the importance and uniqueness of individual agency – ‘Battleship Potemkin’ this ain’t. Funny, compelling and moving.",
    "The most well-loved of all Christmas movies.",
    "I don’t care what your parents told you. It’s a Wonderful Life, that reassuring holiday spectacle, is really the most terrifying Hollywood film ever made. It’s one of a handful of masterpieces directed by Frank Capra, an Italian immigrant who loved America because America saved him.",
    "It's a Wonderful Life is a pretty wonderful movie. It has only one formidable rival (Goldwyn's The Best Years of Our Lives) as Hollywood's best picture of the year.",
    "This sentimental perennial is a holiday chestnut.",
    "The inspirational, thoroughly festive ending is guaranteed to bring tears to the eyes.",
    "Frank Capra and James Stewart, in returning to films after long years in uniform, endow the pic with its most telling contributions. Herewith, Stewart touches the thespic peak of his career. He hasn’t lost a whit of his erstwhile boyish personality (when called to turn it on) and further shows a maturity and depth he seems recently to have acquired.",
    "The film is too sprawling in extent, too noisy as to background music and voices and much too obvious in the application of its social significance notes. But while it isn’t the best picture to come out of Hollywood this year, nor is it Capra’s masterpiece, it tells a good story and its conclusion has a heart-warming effect on the audience.",
    "Without overlooking It’s a Wonderful Life‘s lapses into populist bathos, it’s necessary to rescue the Frank Capra film from its status as an untouchable American “classic.”",
    "Indeed, the weakness of this picture, from this reviewer's point of view, is the sentimentality of it—its illusory concept of life. Mr. Capra's nice people are charming, his small town is a quite beguiling place and his pattern for solving problems is most optimistic and facile. But somehow they all resemble theatrical attitudes rather than average realities. And Mr. Capra's \"turkey dinners\" philosophy, while emotionally gratifying, doesn't fill the hungry paunch.",
    "Capra is an old-time movie craftsman, the master of every trick in the bag, and in many ways he is more at home with the medium than any other Hollywood director. But all of his details give the impression of contrived effect...To make his points he always takes an easy, simple-minded path that doesn’t give much credit to the intelligence of the audience."

I challenge anyone to watch this film and not be touched, if you can, you have no heart!James Stewart is one of my favourite actors, and in this film he acts so naturally you even forget he's an actor playing a part, you really believe his story. You're pulled on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this film, and by no means is this a light hearted look at life, as many believe. This is not a rose tinted look at the wonderful life we have, this is a dark, downtrodden start to a film where the lead character is about to commit suicide.However, it is a beautiful film, and is one of the few that you can watch again and again and walk away with the same glowing feeling as you did when you first watched it.",

The heartwarming story of George Bailey and his selfless, Wonderful Life is a timeless, emotional-rollercoaster of a tale and a true American classic. It displays friendship better than any other movie I’ve ever seen, throughout a humorous, eventful, and lovely plot. Every character is incredibly human, and when George wishes to never be born, only to be placed in a reality by his guardian angel where he really wasn’t born, is genius stuff and is an unforgettable part of this story. Tears of joy will come to almost any human with emotions who watches this movie all the way through. The true spirit of Christmas, joy, is truly captured in this story, and I will love this movie when I’m old even more than when I’m young.",

However, I got the feeling that the movie, despite being really good and entertaining,This film is one of those that any movie lover sees at least once in their life, if only because it is so talked about and so respected among moviegoers. However, I got the feeling that the movie, despite being really good and entertaining, doesn't justify so much buzz. It's a good movie, and there's no doubt about it, but it's not exactly a work of art, as many good commentators have argued. In fact, from the filmography of those involved, it's a film that doesn't even stand out: James Stewart is much more interesting in Hitchcock's films, who knew how to get the best out of the actor, and even Frank Capra made films as or more remarkable than this one.The script is very simple: an angel is sent to help a man at the most difficult moment of his life, when everything indicates that he will be arrested after sacrificing his life and dreams to maintain the firm that his father left him, and that prevents an unscrupulous local millionaire from completely taking over the city and doing what he wants with the people who live there. We are, therefore, facing another Christmas movie, where faith and hope are the main focus. The script, well written and effective, is one of the film's strong points: in addition to bringing us a good story that appeals to the whole family, it is based largely on a main character so pleasant that it is impossible not to like her and just watch. The movie just to see how she will overcome the challenges that lie ahead.The cast is headed by James Stewart, one of the great actors of this time, in another excellent work. At his side, however, are other excellent actors such as Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore or even Henry Travers. The cast's overall performance is good, but that's not what makes us want to see this movie. Deftly directed by Frank Capra, the film has a leisurely pace but doesn't waste a lot of time in exaggerated consideration, doing its best to keep the story going.Technically, it's a regular film that makes the most of the resources available at its time, without overshadowing the story it wants to tell, nor going to the director's head, determined to keep the film in a direct and relatively frank record. The black-and-white cinematography is very good and pleasant, and everything was excellently shot, with sharpness and clarity. The editing work was also well done, and the cuts are barely noticeable. The sets and costumes are well done, the dialogues were very well written and there are many memorable moments.",

We start our journey by analyzing the biggest moments of the character's childhood and adolescence. Identification with him is effortless and satisfying. We then arrive to his adult life and see its ups and downs. The main plot takes a lot of time to germinate. Some parts of the movie are quite long and seem superficial but (no spoiler) the end is definitively worth it.I found the guardian angel (who is the character that makes the plot go forward) kind of selfish (because he only accomplishes his mission) and dull.Acting, and especially James Stewart, is awesome. Each characters has his own face and mood.The main flaw I have to address to this movie is that it is way too much american. Starting from the fact that it clearly is a Christmas movie in which everyone love each other, it compiles the standards of the perfect american life (taking back the job of your father, going to college, meeting the most beautiful girl in here and dance all night, going to university, getting rich  and married and having a lovely family with a lot of children).In the end this movie isn't unpleasant and the morality is really cool.",
