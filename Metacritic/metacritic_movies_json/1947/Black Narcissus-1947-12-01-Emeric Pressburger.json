  "summary": "A group of nuns struggle to establish a convent in the Himalayas, while isolation, extreme weather, altitude, and culture clashes all conspire to drive the well-intentioned missionaries mad.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "It remains a rapturous, near-indescribable work of cinematic art, spun from a simple story about nuns who travel to the Himalayas to start a school and a hospital, only to have mountain winds and native mysticism weaken their confidence and their faith.",
    "The co-directors created from Rumer Godden's novel an extraordinary melodrama of repressed love and Forsterian Englishness - or rather Irishness - coming unglued in the vertiginous landscape of South Asia.",
    "For Powell and Pressburger, the personal and the political—much like their distinctive mix of high and low artistry—weren’t separate bedfellows: Even a marvelously entertaining tale of repressed abbesses on the edge could explore, with enduring resonance and profundity, an empire losing its grip.",
    "Sexual tension hangs in the air as the wind blows and native drums beat, but it's on a visual level that the film excels.",
    "Black Narcissus impishly keeps watch over the Archers’ canon with a sunken, rabidly prismatic eye.",
    "An odd, unsettling film which suggests the dangers of both emotional restraint and unchecked passion, Black Narcissus is also one of the most visually beautiful films ever made in color.",
    "Black Narcissus has an erotic charge that's to this day been so often lacking in British cinema.",
    "This is a landmark of Hollywood-on-Thames trompe-l’oeil.",
    "Powell and Press-burger may have a picture that will disturb and antagonize some, they also have in Black Narcissus an artistic accomplishment of no small proportions.",
    "Films on this subject are generally solemn and naive, but director Michael Powell and writer Emeric Pressburger bring wit and intelligence to it.",
    "The cast has been well chosen, but Kerr gets only occasional opportunities to reveal her talents.",
    "One of my problems with Black Narcissus is that I never found the characters credible. I didn’t believe any of them and their interpersonal conflicts contrived and artificial."
