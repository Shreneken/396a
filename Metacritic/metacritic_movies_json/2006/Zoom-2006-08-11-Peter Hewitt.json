  "critic_reviews": [
    "If August has turned the children in your life into Bored Girl and Fidget Boy, you could find worse ways to keep them entertained.",
    "Zoom suffers from following three \"X-Men\" movies and \"Sky High,\" but even if it preceded them, it'd still qualify as little more than a cheap, ugly, forgettable footnote to the seemingly endless superhero boom.",
    "\"X-Men\" sans the intellect and atmosphere.",
    "Pure Saturday matinee kiddie fodder and this close to going straight to DVD.",
    "A family-friendly adventure.",
    "Zoom is a movie that would make Dr. Frankenstein proud. Put together with parts from so many other movies, the thing positively clanks.",
    "This tepid comic-bookish comedy should zip through its theatrical run faster than a speeding bullet. It likely won't perform much more superheroically in ancillary venues.",
    "Tim Allen gamely brings some humanity to the role of the retired, powerless hero Captain Zoom, but is thwarted at every turn by bad special effects, slapdash editing, interminable pop-song montages, and a goofy performance by Courteney Cox.",
    "Bleeds boredom from every frame.",
    "One of the most dismal excuses for family entertainment ever perpetrated by a major studio, this crude, lazy variation on Disney's \"Sky High\" (2005) revolves around the education of four \"special\" youngsters at the hands of a washed-up superhero.",
    "Zoom is a C-list production in every possible way, from the actors and the special effects to the music and the script. Even the product placement is completely third rate.",
    "In a feat of dullness quite powerful in its own way, this lifeless family comedy sucks the joy from every joke it touches.",
    "A kid comedy that's been zapped by extraterrestrial suckiness rays.",
    "This comedy drags its feet, while the sappy sweetness will make you wince."

It has respectable performances from Tim Allen, Courtney Cox, Chevy Chase, and Rip Torn, and features Kate Mara in an earlier role.  The move has decent special effects - not amazing, yet pretty much fitting for what the movie is.  This isn't high art.  It's not serious drama, and it's not a big-budget superhero action thriller.  What it is, is fun - if you can remember how to watch a movie and have fun.",

But maybe that's too harsh; perhaps, \"X-Men for Bedwetters\" is more appropriate, which is to say that a small child won't know the difference between \"Zoom\" and its more sophisticated predecessor. But if you're not mourning over the cancellation of WB's \"Jack and Bobby\", bring a kid or stay home. You'll notice right away that the film is hampered by a limited budget(no money to show the original team in action sans comic panels, or visual progress of Zoom's nemesis), and tired \"big name\" actors(Chevy Chase gets my vote for the most tired). Naturally, the younger actors fare better because their career trajectory is going in a different direction.",

The reviews are all paid by big corparetions like marvel and hollywood,  tim allen singlehandedly made the best movie.. It's not bad... If you like this movie, then you should also watch the other movies with tyim allen.. ok my mom told me tim allen didnt direct it, but still he contributed very much... watch the movie before yo0u hate on it...
