  "summary": "Tim Allen transforms from family dad to family dog and back again in this fresh update of the Disney comedy classic The Shaggy Dog.  (Disney)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "As good as family entertainment gets.",
    "What The Shaggy Dog feels like, more than anything, is an old-fashioned Disney movie.",
    "The star (Allen), unleashed, is so energetic in his approximation of a bearded collie -- his nose sniffing the air, his whole being (which toggles between human and canine form) overcome by the need to fetch any stick thrown -- that his slobbery charm carries the picture.",
    "A fast-moving Walt Disney Co. comedy that manages to sail past many of the cliches usually found in this genre while throwing together a wild story line more apt for a new millennium.",
    "Ms. Curtin is one of several examples of quirky casting that make this Shaggy Dog much more fun than it might have been.",
    "May not make you howl, but it does offer a few bona fide belly laughs.",
    "For a kids' picture this is relatively funny.",
    "There are many delightful movie techniques out there available for making animals appear to speak, so it's too bad The Shaggy Dog doesn't use any of them.",
    "The extraordinary canine performances in Shaggy Dog and \"Eight Below\" lead me to wonder whether Disney could dispense with two-legged creatures altogether, until further notice.",
    "In movies as in life, superior technology doesn't necessarily trump humor, magic or really shaggy dogs.",
    "This is precisely the type of moviegoing experience engineered for those who still get a laugh when the Baha Men hit \"Who Let the Dogs Out?\" accompanies a doggie mayhem montage.",
    "The unruly pack of subplots make The Shaggy Dog much more convoluted than it needs to be. But Allen's physical comedy as man-becoming-dog, and his non-stop monologue as man-dog, are definitely worth a trip to the matinee.",
    "In this serviceable remake of the fondly remembered 1959 Disney comedy (which starred Fred MacMurray), an impressively dexterous Tim Allen plays Dave Douglas.",
    "There are precious few surprises here, but parents will find director Robbins' breezy remake a painless affair and, judging by the yowls of laughter from the peanut gallery at the screening I attended, the kids will be barking all the way home.",
    "It says something for Robert Downey Jr. that in a movie where a man becomes a dog, Downey creates the weirdest character.",
    "Strictly for the very young who will find giggles in the anthropomorphic mash-ups and won't be too distracted by the predictably mawkish sitcom plot.",
    "Crafting this crude, noisy remake of Disney's first live-action comedy required the labor of no fewer than five screenwriters.",
    "My eight-year-old nephew sat nearly silent throughout, so when he says he had fun, he must be talking about the treats.",
    "This fur-fetched tale is bearable family viewing.",
    "Feels like little more than a stale rehash with a promising cast whose talents haven't been tapped.",
    "Okay, so when does the fun start?",
    "As a comic actor, Allen's palette is limited to varying degrees of beige. He is not only boring, he's obnoxious and narcissistic. Where's the ASPCA -- the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Audiences -- when you need 'em?",
    "Who let this dog out?",
    "The movie is just this side of terrible. It misses all the charm and fun of the original. Allen's mugging is incorrigibly unfunny."

Hay demasiado humor tonto, y las situaciones serias contrastan demasiado sin haber mucho equilibrio. Ademas de tener algunos huecos argumentales: No se sabe que pasa con los dos científicos de azul al final o como sabia Douglas el verdadero nombre del perro. Si bien en su momento le tuve mucha nostalgia, me doy cuenta ahora de que es una película muy mala, con un gran potencial desperdiciado.",
