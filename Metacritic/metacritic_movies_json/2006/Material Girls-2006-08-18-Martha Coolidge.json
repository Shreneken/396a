  "summary": "A comedy that takes you from the penthouse to the poorhouse and back again, along with  Ava and Tanzie Marchetta (the Duff sisters) as celebutantes who realize that potential they never knew they had.  (MGM)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The Duffs are certainly cute together, but not even their natural chemistry can enliven all the preachy bits about hard work and the meaning of happiness.",
    "Isn't as witty, stylish, or sophisticated as the similarly themed \"The Devil Wears Prada.\" Material Girls is pitched to the Seventeen crowd, and it succeeds on its own terms. These days, even pre teens live in a material world.",
    "It's less substantial than cotton candy, but Material Girls is as slickly produced as one of the Marchetta TV spots.",
    "A superficial tween comedy that mocks celebutantes like the Olsen twins while simultaneously pushing stars Hilary and Haylie Duff as their replacements.",
    "The Duffs don't even fully commit to their characters here -- theyâ€™'e seemingly undecided about whether they can get away with being shallow and bratty without ruining their family-friendly images.",
    "The real-life sisters Hilary and Haylie Duff star in this incompetent spin on the poor-little-rich-girl story.",
    "The most shocking moment comes during the closing credits, when it's revealed that not one, not two, but three screenwriters were responsible for a plot that someone seems to have hastily slapped together after taking a walk around a Sephora outlet while listening to \"Beat Of My Heart\" on loop.",
    "It's not \"Clueless,\" just clueless.",
    "Painfully unfunny comedy.",
    "There is plenty of blame to go around for this laughless mess.",
    "Even by the low standards of the genre it represents, this female teen comedy represents a new nadir.",
    "Mainly offers fodder for tweens who fantasize about glamorous Los Angeles lifestyles where everyone is skinny, rich, and on Prozac. It's a film where gays and minorities not only fit into stereotypes, but embrace them."

I've always hated Hilary Duff, and I also hate how many little sisters are famous off their big sisters (Jamie Lynne Spears, Ashlee Simpson), and this movie had both! It was a two-for-one. The acting was horrible, the plot was bland. The only thing I wanted was a refund for my money, and a time reimbursement for the hour and a half I spent there. I feel bad for anyone whose mind even flits accross the vague notion of seeing this film.",
