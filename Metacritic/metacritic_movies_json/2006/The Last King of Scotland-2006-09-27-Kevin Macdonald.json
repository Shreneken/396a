Impressed by Dr. Garrigan's brazen attitude in a moment of crisis, the newly self-appointed Ugandan President Amin hand picks him as his personal physician and closest confidante. Though Garrigan is at first flattered and fascinated by his new position, he soon awakens to Amin's savagery - and his own complicity in it. Horror and betrayal ensue as Garrigan tries to right his wrongs and escape Uganda alive.  (Fox Searchlight Pictures)… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Of course no Western director can make a movie about Africa without being accused of colonialism himself, and some critics have faulted The Last King of Scotland for focusing on its white hero as black corpses pile up around him. But although the movie takes place on an international political stage, it's still a drama of individual allegiance.",
    "Unlike Sean Penn's demagogue in \"All the King's Men,\" you're able to forget that Whitaker is acting. He embodies the role. When clips of the real Amin are shown at the end, it's almost shocking to realize the extent to which Whitaker has become him.",
    "Jumping off from the brilliant novel by Giles Foden and changing a key character entirely, it dramatizes and wrings humor from the way a white Western renegade can view a self-made Third World despot like Amin as a superman blowing fresh air into a fetid atmosphere.",
    "The film is phenomenally well directed by Kevin Macdonald and edited by Justine Wright to bring out every bit of scary volatility in the most casual interactions.",
    "Forest Whitaker, uncorking the power that he usually holds in check, gives a chilling, bravura performance as Ugandan tyrant Idi Amin, whose bloody regime slaughtered more than 300,000 people. This intelligent, sometimes gruesome thriller is based on a novel by Giles Foden.",
    "The Last King of Scotland is a parable shocking in its truth, jolting in its lack of sentimentality, Shakespearean in its vision of the doctor's catastrophic flaw.",
    "Drawing on a documentary visual style he deftly employed in \"One Day in September\" and \"Touching the Void,\" director Kevin Macdonald uses McAvoy's boyishness to treat Garrigan's apolitical foolishness as yet another damn mess in one African country's hell.",
    "Whitaker is terrifying in a way that we recognize not from old movies but from life.",
    "The movie is an extraordinary personal adventure that views everything through the eyes of its hero as it carries him from one apocalyptic situation to another.",
    "Captures the energy and exuberance of a young nation in the throes of optimism and works it into a foreboding frenzy.",
    "This is a wonderful, horrifying performance: Whitaker doesn't take the easy way out by playing Amin as a killer clown, a treacherous buffoon.",
    "Macdonald has a fetching feel for the continent, and the movie has a powerful sense of what Africa looks and feels like; you can almost smell it.",
    "In addition to a very engaging script, Forrest Whitaker and James McAvoy amazingly express the tension and the camaraderie shared by Amin and Garrigan.",
    "Both an enthralling examination of a horrific time and an adrenalin-filled thriller full of wry humour.",
    "Whitaker's Amin is the kind of raging lunatic that only an actor who has made a specialty of quiet caginess could pull off so convincingly. It's great, and scary, to see Whitaker turn it up to 11 for once.",
    "Director Kevin Macdonald has fashioned a film that is at times nearly as harrowing as his previous endeavor, \"Touching the Void.\"",
    "The supporting cast is uniformly strong, with Simon McBurney standing out as an oily representative of the British foreign service.",
    "Forest Whitaker is astoundingly multifaceted and convincing as Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. In the performance of his career, he fully inhabits the part of the barbaric and charismatic ruler.",
    "The story is fanciful, with grotesquely improbable twists involving the fictional Garrigan (James McAvoy) and one of the dictator's three wives (Kerry Washington). But as Amin, Forest Whitaker's command of the screen is so thorough, so frightening, so ripe with malice that you won't move in your seat for fear of catching his eye.",
    "Whitaker is on fire, and as long as he's onscreen, King keeps you riveted.",
    "The director is Kevin Macdonald, a documentary filmmaker making his fiction film feature debut. (He won an Oscar for his Munich Olympics hostage chronicle, \"One Day in September.\")",
    "Great as Whitaker is in this juicy slab of Oscar bait, Macdonald's movie doesn't have much to offer beyond a pair of stunning performances, propulsive editing, fantastic scenery and the heartbeat rhythms of African music.",
    "For Whitaker's performance alone, Last King is a substantial piece of work. Otherwise, the film is estimable but not quite great.",
    "Director Kevin Macdonald, an accomplished maker of documentaries making his feature-film debut, gives The Last King of Scotland the pace and crackle of a thriller, albeit a thriller with substance.",
    "An imaginative and original picture turns conventional as it ends.",
    "In the end, The Last King of Scotland is much better when it plays it cool and amusing than when it tries to ramp up outrage and indignation.",
    "Whitaker, in the performance of a lifetime, makes him (Idi Amin) a charismatic madman.",
    "An adequate thriller redeemed by Forest Whitaker's sensational turn as Idi Amin.",
    "Furiously paced, with excellent performances by Forest Whitaker as Amin and James McAvoy as the foolish Scotsman who becomes the leader's personal physician, the film has texture, if not depth and enough intelligence to almost persuade you that it actually has something of note to say.",
    "The Last King of Scotland never rises to the standard set by Forest Whitaker's fearless (and fearsome) performance as Idi Amin.",
    "The Last King Of Scotland makes a stronger case when it's demonstrating how opulent power-lunches corrupt absolutely.",
    "Unfortunately, despite a committed and lively performance, McAvoy's Scottish doctor is fictional, an amalgam of Amin's \"white monkeys.\"",
    "The Last King of Scotland joins the ranks of nightmarish innocents-abroad movies, from \"Midnight Express\" to \"Hostel,\" where the disillusioned hero fights to return to civility.",
    "This veteran actor is always great, and it's just a little bit sad that he has to play a big, scary demon for us to sit up and finally take notice.",
    "Besides its title, the movie has retained the book's outline...But the film throws away the point of the book completely."

Many historically infamous individuals begin humbly and rise to rule, based upon their accurate While Idi Amen degraded to the status of Dictator and maniacal murderer, this movie did little to establish the foundation for his rise to power. Many historically infamous individuals begin humbly and rise to rule, based upon their accurate sense of what their people desire. Idi Amen was such a person. He was a 9-time heavyweight boxing champion and sargeant in the British military, who won the support and sponsorship of the British leadership. Being an African, one can easily conclude that this support was based, to some degree, on an enormous charisma and aptitude. While his political career was rife with abuse and tyrrany, it would have been appropriate to show some of the character he had to exhibit in order to command such broad based support, both from his own people, as well as the British government. Instead, the movie brings us into the latter years of an administration and personality gone off track and tending towards the manic. This may well be true, but no dictator has ruled that has not first been given permission. In addition, the rise of the young Scottish docctor seems utterly inappropriate, given Idi Amen's proven ability to win the favor of nations and people. A person of his considerable and terrible ability would not have been as easily trusting as the Idi Amen characterized in the film. Quite honestly, he had too much personal capital at stake to entrust it to someone with so little wit or wisdom. It is believed his true mentor was a member of the British Secret Service...this makes sense. Finally, the films portrayal of the African woman was utterly disgusting. I absolutely do not believe that women oppressed as they are by their muslim traditions and/or tribal rituals, would be so easily bedded. If this is the case for the average African woman, how much more applicable to the wife of the President, a dictator, a murderer. For if she did not fear him for her own life, she would have certainly feared him for the life of her son. There is no way any reasonable mother would enter so lightly into a situation that had such daunting implications. That this film would ask us to accept such a scenario is a disgrace to every mother of African decent, down to Margaret Garner, who attempted to kill her own children vs. see them sold into slavery. This portryal is a betrayal of the truth. I am disappointed that in 2007, we still have little tolerance for the truth regarding people of color. We are not beasts with passions like unto animals in heat or enraged, but a complex, human creation...sometimes touching the heavens and othertimes at the very gates of hell, but nonetheless human like unto all.",

But once I got over the fact that Forest Whitaker is not the main character (despite all evidence in the previews), I decided it was actually a fairly powerful movie with some great acting. Whitaker was brilliant as always, though it was disappointing that he once again was cheated out of being the main character. The main character was a bit too much of a Romeo for my taste, and his quick ascension to \"bosom buddy\" status with a violent dictator was a bit hard to swallow. But the movie did present an interesting journey through McAvoy's character's mental/emotional struggles as he realized what Idi Amin was really all about.

The film contains some brilliantly worked scenes and the way the angles constantly vary allow us to look at the life of Idi Amin as both an insider and an outside observer.

Even though \"Triumph of the Will\" implicates her as a Nazi sympathizer by what's judiciously omitted from the crowd-inciting speeches; Nicholas(James McAvoy) amazingly has no idea about the Ugandian holocaust. \"The Last King of Scotland\" has an ingenious way of treating McAvoy's relationship with Idi Amin as a pleasant nostalgic trip, because the young doctor was indeed enamored with the vicious, but charismatic dictator. If this adaptation is accurate, the real-life McAvoy must be plagued with some residual affection for Amin. Forrest Whitaker does an awesome job of being genuinely congenial without any undercurrent of menace; to do so would make a contemporary audience wonder why the world wasn't onto Amin's act a lot sooner.

He soon he finds himself hired as Idi Amin’s personal physician but quickly discovers the dictators’ charms hide his murderous regime.\r The first half of movie provides a meaty examination of Amin’s savagely violent regime. His false charm quickly gives way to his true nature and Forrest Whitaker gives an excellent portrayal of the dictator coming across as the eccentric and truly terrifying man that he was. Once Garrigan becomes aware of what is really going on in the country the movie becomes more of a thriller than character study as he attempts to escape with his life. Some of the scenes towards the movies end are perhaps a little Hollywood and not completely fitting with the movies original tone. They are however still undeniably exciting and with James McAvoy giving an assured performance throughout The Last King of Scotland is certainly an interesting and entertaining movie.",

Directed by Kevin MacDonald,\"The Last King Of Scotland\" is the mostly true story of Nicholas Garrigan (McAvoy), a young Scottish physician who travels to Uganda and eventually becomes the personal doctor to the dictator, Idi Amin (Whitaker). Directed by Kevin MacDonald, this movie certainly struck a few dissonant chords with me. I'm not saying the film was bad, in fact I found it \"The Last King Of Scotland\" to be a very remarkable motion picture. However, it is a deeply disturbing piece that aims to show the audience just how deranged Idi Amin was as Uganda's President. Which brings me to the film's most noteworthy aspect - Forest Whitaker's amazing, Academy-Award Winning turn as Idi Amin himself. Forest Whitaker's performance in \"The Last King Of Scotland\" is incredibly dynamic because at times I found myself laughing, gasping, and cringing in anger at some of the things that Whitaker did on screen. Some of the stuff that Whitaker's Amin does in this movie is truly frightening and really made me realize just how much of a megalomaniacal sociopath Amin was in real life. In fact there is one moment in this movie (one that I won't fully disclose due to it's grisliness) where I found myself just gaping at my television set - yeah stuff gets pretty grotesque. Obviously, Whitaker rightfully earned the Oscar For Best Actor in 2007. As for James McAvoy, he did a great job in his role as the doctor who just can't seem to escape the madness of Idi Amin, and throughout the movie you really learn to feel for his character. The script, of course, was brilliantly written, as it was adapted from the reportedly excellent Giles Foden novel of the same name. In terms of cinematography, I thought that the film's use of close-up shots on Amin really helped to accentuate his sheer madness and insanity. As for the rest of the camera work everything looks clean and efficient. All in all, I found \"The Last King Of Scotland\" to be a very remarkable, and disconcerting film that effectively used it's brilliant performances and impressive script to highlight the sheer terror that Idi Amin inflicted upon Uganda and it's people.",

Some of the issues I had with this film where that sometimes McAvoy gets a bit too much of the attention. The character McAvoy is playing was fictional and sometimes he took time away from Amin who was the real man.

The premiseand the execution that satisfies it..The Last King Of ScotlandThe Last King Of Scotland is a character driven drama about a friendship between two polar opposite personalities that is explored through geopolitical perspective. The premise requires extraordinary chemistry between the lead characters and is delivered unflinchingly by the cast through their performance. But the primary reason why it works is that it isn't based upon one's textbook formula of depicting the bonding from the scratch. These pragmatic characters bonds instantly with mature mutual objectives or ideology and the makers have somehow managed to keep it on the edge of the storyline that leaves the audience uncertain and unaware of the repercussions that it is breeding or where the track is leading to. The writing is mature, adaptive and layered if not gripping, but is certainly worth the work it offers. The background score isn't impressive but few songs are up beating along with metaphorical cinematography and fine editing. The camera work with unusual theme draws the attention which is then celebrated by the cultural references and the knack for projecting inherent rituals that is well detailed. McDonald's world is bolder and much smarter but as much as work it has invested on the semantics, it fails to foliate the subjective procedure of it. As mentioned earlier, Whittaker has never been so convincing and so confident and on the other hand, McAvoy shows some promising range on portraying vulnerability and slick persona. The ruggedness among the three dimensional characters, its perpetual ideology and panache on methodology and, stellar performance that fuels this drama are the high points of the feature.Armed with a fascinating and creative structure, The Last King Of Scotland is an art that demands to be explored upon and its the writing that demands it and the execution that satisfies it.",

Directed by Kevin Macdonald, this film has a screenplay by Jeremy Brock and Peter Morgan. The cast is led by Forest Whitaker and James McAvoy.This film portrays, mostly, real facts which are part of the dark side of the history of a young African country: Uganda. Idi Amin led the country with an iron fist, not hesitating to kill all potential opponents. Despite all the cast have played their role with great quality, Whitaker deserves mention: he knew perfectly incorporate the several facets of this highly contradictory historical character: in some moments, his thought and personality can seem very positive but, as the film is rolling, the audience increasingly contacts with the darker side of a deeply paranoid personality, worthy of a Caligula. Whitaker was truly intimidating, and the staff of characterization and costume managed to complete his work by giving him a strong physical resemblance to the real dictator. So its not surprising that Whitaker has won (with merit) the Oscar for Best Leading Actor. But be friend with someone like Amin means walking on the edge of a knife and too close to death. The character of McAvoy, a young idealistic and naive doctor from Scotland who went to Africa in search of adventure, shows us these dangers, and its delightful to see his mind awakening to the problems of that country, while contacting directly with the madness of his new African friend.Visual, special and sound effects were very good, especially in the most stunning scenes, and scenarios easily transport us to Africa. The script, in turn, is quite consistent and realistic, not falling into exaggeration nor blistering action scenes. Everything went as it should, everything was done in the correct measure.",
