    "summary": "The twisted minds of two of the six screenwriters behind \"Scary Movie\" skewer the romantic comedy genre.  (20th Century Fox)",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "In Date Movie, the hormones, anxiety, and princess jealousy that fuel the majority of Hollywood love stories are made so excessive that the romance itself is revealed to be...every bit as big a crock as it usually is.",
        "Date Movie has enough laughs to make rambunctious dudes hoot and holler, but not nearly enough to ensure the happy ending it promises.",
        "Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg, who wrote the screenplay, have crammed dozens of movie parodies into this deliberately juvenile spoof of romantic comedies. Mr. Seltzer, who directed, has made very few of them funny.",
        "This anemic genre parody from two of the six writers of \"Scary Movie\" strives for the goofball precision of the brothers Zucker and, long before it reaches the end of its 70-odd minutes, gives you newfound respect for the comic genius of the brothers Wayans (two of the other writers of \"Scary Movie\").",
        "Date Movie, alas, is here to remind us that slapstick can be just plain bad. These are sight gags best appreciated with a blindfold.",
        "A lame pastiche of Hollywood romances.",
        "The choice is yours: Shell out 10 bucks for this dire spoof of recent romantic comedies a la \"Scary Movie\" and \"Not Another Teen Movie\", or toss your 12-year-old nephew a quarter and get him to act out scenes from his favorite movies for 80 minutes: The entertainment value will be about the same.",
        "Arguably the lamest of all the free-wheeling genre parodies that have taken flight since \"Airplane!,\" Date Movie is stupefyingly unfunny in its attempts to mock romantic comedies, celebrities, reality TV shows and anything else that pops into the heads of its creators.",
        "The only thing remotely resembling parody in this depressing waste of time and money is Jennifer Coolidge's sendup of Barbra Streisand as an over-the-top string of Jewish mother clich\u00e9s.",
        "A lowest common denominator spoof.",
        "This crass drag of a dud at best manages to elicit just a couple of half-hearted chuckles over the course of its 80-minute allotment.",
        "\"Comedy is hard,\" said Steve Martin. For the writers of Date Movie, it's apparently impossible.",
        "A collection of throwaway gags from other movies, a big blue recycling barrel of comedy waiting for the trash collector. It's rated PG-13 because 13 is the maximum age of those who might find it funny.",
        "Elapsed time before I walked out: 29 minutes\r\nTotal laughs (in that period): 0",
        "Date Movie is a good date movie in one sense: If you're still speaking to the person who brought you to see this, you just might have a future together.",
        "Pre- credits, Date Movie runs a mere 70 minutes, which increasingly seems like seven minutes, repeated 10 times.",
        "It's kind of amazing that a joke-a-second comedy like Date Movie doesn't contain a single laugh.",
        "Boasting that your film features \"two of the six writers of Scary Movie,\" as this film's marketing campaign does, is like bragging that you came in second in the annual Bulwer-Lytton Bad Fiction Contest."

It is a film that seems to want to punish the audience for existing. I teach high school students a film course in comedy, and invariably there will be a contingent who complain about having to watch -- egads -- black-and-white movies or, worse, silent films. This operates on the mistaken assumption that sound + color = funny. It's the right of the uneducated to -- up to a certain point -- hold this blanket, underinformed preconception. I can only pray that Date Movie is the antidote. Here is a movie that is wall-to-wall body fluid/function jokes (in color and sound, no less) and there's not a laugh to be found. This is in opposition to Not Another Teen Movie or the tv show Reno: 911, which rely on all manner of fluid/function jokes and bother to make them funny. Maybe I can thank the makers of Date Movie for giving me a film that pretty much every one can point to and say, \"See that so-called 'comedy' movie? The one called Date Movie? Yeah, that one. Not funny!\" Perhaps we can show this film to anti-American terrorists, assuring them that we, too, find it horrendously unfunny. There IS common ground. Who knows? Maybe the makers of Date Movie will be awarded a Nobel for uniting the world against this one thing. This is a film that even the stellar cuteness of Alyson Hannigan, the endless charm of Fred Willard, and the inventive verve of Jennifer Coolidge can't save.",

I haven't seen any episodes of her prime time CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother (perhaps if I spent less time going to films like Date Movie I'd have more of a chance to) but her portrayal of shy computer genius Willow Rosenberg on Buffy the Vampire Slayer made that character the heart of the show; late in the series when she unleashes her grief-fueled Wiccan rage on the whole world after her lover is senselessly murdered, most of us were more concerned for HER fate than we were for that of Planet Earth. And Hannigan was nothing less than completely adorable and beguiling as the \"band-camp girl\" in the American Pie movie series, turning a potentially irritating character into a universally beloved one. (Her prospective-father-in-law/ daughter-in-law chat in American Wedding was surprisingly sweet and heartfelt, especially given that so much of the conversation dealt with Jason Biggs' pubic hair!) These were Hannigan's triumphs as an actress, and so is Date Movie, a would-be spoof of the most popular romantic comedies of the last couple decades, in which Hannigan, as the heroine, never ever mugs, winks or pushes the jokes, or does anything other than play the situations for total emotional reality regardless of their obvious absurdity (even when she's wearing a fat suit). This is the same approach Julie Hagerty took as the main stewardess in Airplane!, and it makes both actresses not only tremendously endearing but also very, very funny. Tony Cox, the little person with attitude who played Billy Bob Thornton's partner-in-crime in Bad Santa, brings us a twisted variant on Will Smith's matchmaker/ miracle worker in Hitch, and is a riot no matter what he does, and there are devastating, spot-on impersonations of Streisand and J. Lo by Jennifer Coolidge and Valery M. Ortiz. What's truly amazing about all these performers is how consistently amusing they manage to be given that they have virtually no material whatsoever to work with; Date Movie's fatal flaw is not only its inability to improve on famous movie sequences that were already funny to begin with (how DO you improve on Meg Ryan's legendary restaurant scene in When Harry Met Sally..., anyway?) but most of the time it doesn't even seem to be trying: the writers endeavor to mock My Best Friend's Wedding's terrific restaurant sing-along bit but are too lazy and slovenly to get the meter of Burt Bacharach's and Hal David's \"I Say A Little Prayer\" right or even to provide rhyming words! In all fairness, there's one amusing (if obvious) take on the most famous sequence in Say Anything, but the huge majority of the time the filmmakers just take the easiest, most obvious way out, going for the grossest, most disgusting low blow possible; I saw this with a largely adolescent audience and the \"EEEWWWW's\" outnumbered the genuine laughs at least 100:1. WKRP in Cincinnati creator Hugh Wilson, in rewriting the script for the first Police Academy movie, stated that he was certainly no prude, but a good solid joke is preferable to mindless tastelessness any day of the week. The fact that I have to resort to using Police Academy as a \"how-to\" counterpoint to Date Movie's \"how-NOT-to\" approach to comedy is bad enough, but being in the position of praising Hannigan's great work and that of some of her co-stars while simultaneously telling everyone I know to run as far and fast in the opposite direction of the movie that showcases said work is far worse.",

It's also pretty darn funny because of it. Acting as a spoof of various romantic comedies, this is the type of movie that will probably only please those like myself who are easily amused at crudeness. Whether it's relying on gross out moments, shock humor, or just an over the top parody, there are some laugh worthy moments scattered throughout. It might not be the best spoof out there, but it's far from the worst. There are enough funny moments here for me to recommend this, but this type of humor isn't going to appeal to everyone.",
