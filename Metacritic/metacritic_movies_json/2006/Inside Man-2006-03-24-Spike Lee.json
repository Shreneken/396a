  "critic_reviews": [
    "The thrills in Spike Lee's singularly savvy thriller are in small unexpected moments.",
    "The jazzish score, by Lee's music man, Terence Blanchard, is typically intrusive. But the mood is right, the twists are new. And with one casting inspiration, Inside Man furthers the rising stardom of Chiwetel Ejiofor (Serenity).",
    "This is the mother lode all action/suspense directors search for and Lee, who usually doesn't work in that genre, has hit it.",
    "A superior nail-biter.",
    "As with all of Lee's films, there's much more going on beneath the surface than is immediately apparent.",
    "Inside Man may be a cat-and-mouse game, but it's far from predictable. What could have been a straightforward thriller is unusually clever, visually captivating and unfailingly entertaining.",
    "Washington hasn't been this relaxed in years. When he feels like it he can be the most charismatic star in the movies.",
    "With juicy supporting roles for Chiwetel Ejiofor and Willem Dafoe as Washington's fellow officers, the film works best when the characters are just sitting back and shooting the breeze, which is what they're doing much of the time. Here, puzzling out a robbery is more fun than stopping it.",
    "It twists in on itself mercilessly, rarely pausing to let the viewers catch up, but that's OK. A movie like this depends on staying at least a step ahead of its audience, and this one surely does.",
    "Working with someone else's material and a story outside the mainstream of his (Lee) work, he delivers laughs, puzzles, tension and the immense gift of fine actors at their delicious, familiar best.",
    "I found myself savoring a thriller (as well as a Spike Lee “joint”) that wasn't, for a change, in my face.",
    "It's certainly a Spike Lee film, but no Spike Lee Joint. Still, he's delivered a pacy, vigorous and frequently masterful take on a well-worn genre.",
    "The heist at the heart of Inside Man is brilliant, and so is the movie.",
    "A deft, tense, pure thriller, the movie has great star turns and is brilliantly directed, but it began as an extremely well-crated screenplay by Russell Gewirtz. It's professionally entertaining.",
    "Filled with playful noise and nonsense, clever feints and digressions, Inside Man has a story to tell, but its most sustained pleasures come from its performances, especially the three leads.",
    "Smartly plotted by newcomer Russell Gewirtz and smoothly directed by, of all people, Spike Lee, Inside Man is a deft and satisfying entertainment, an elegant, expertly acted puzzler that is just off-base and out-of-the-ordinary enough to keep us consistently involved.",
    "The best Spike Lee movie to come along since 1992's \"Malcolm X.\" It's also the first Spike Lee movie since \"Malcolm X\" to star Denzel Washington, and just as Jimmy Stewart and Alfred Hitchcock brought out the best in each other, Denzel and Spike need each other like vermouth and gin.",
    "It's Foster who rules the movie like an ice queen.",
    "The movie crackles with the serio-comic tension of thin-skinned New Yorkers thrown together in a crisis.",
    "The suspense crackles, the acting sizzles and the script, by promising first-timer Russell Gewirtz, keeps tossing surprises like grenades.",
    "A workmanlike thriller that provides solid performances; a mixture of comedy, tension, and drama; and an engaging storyline. But there's nothing extraordinary about the movie.",
    "The script's flaws are most keenly felt in the Jodie Foster storyline, to the point where her character seems more like a bumbling screw-up than a supposedly sought-after facilitator. Whenever Lee turns the camera back to Denzel and Clive though, the movie works.",
    "Go with the flow, and it remains a taut and well-engineered thriller. Poke at plot incongruities, as I was doing literally on the way to the parking lot, and it starts to unravel.",
    "Unexpectedly funny, leisurely paced and oblivious to the demands of its genre, Inside Man has a loose, playful vibe that's at odds with its grave life-and-death scenario.",
    "Lee transforms a generic cops-crooks-and-hostages scenario into a smart, sharp heist movie by the sheer force of his love for, and knowledge of, the city where he lives.",
    "Well acted and hugely entertaining, the film strikes a near-flawless balance between sly pop-culture allusions and the details of how business gets done under pressure.",
    "It's got style and charisma to spare, with all the characters acting from fiery reserves of self-interest, including Christopher Plummer as a bank president with a secret in his safe-deposit box.",
    "Has a doozy of a surprise ending that doesn't really stand up under close scrutiny - but you'll have so much fun getting there, it's easy to go along with Lee and company for the ride.",
    "A flashy cast, clever script and vibrant showcasing of New York City as the ultimate melting pot are strong plusses for Spike Lee's most mainstream studio venture.",
    "The more it sags as a thriller, the more it jabs and jangles as a study of racial abrasion.",
    "Inside Man certainly functions as a genre film, but the backbeat of inane banter and schoolyard trash-talking serves to promote an infectious sense of levity.",
    "The primary weakness is in the story itself, which at times seems like mere background for the snappy banter and knowing glances.",
    "In Sidney Lumet's \"Dog Day Afternoon,\" which only looks better with the years, New York was as much a character in that film as its people. It was a movie that took its cue from the energy of the city. The Inside Man takes its cue mostly from other movies.",
    "The best scene in Inside Man is one of the simplest, a cat-and-mouser, wherein the hostage negotiator played by Washington pays a visit to Foster's wily manipulator. These two play it so cool, yet so clearly enjoy each other's onscreen company, it's a ticklish reminder of the simple pleasures of screen acting.",
    "The whole plot smells fishy. It's not that the movie is hiding something, but that when it's revealed, it's been left sitting too long at room temperature. Inside Man goes to much difficulty to arrive at too little.",
    "As the end credits are rolling: What happened? Suddenly, the film stalls, and everything that looked great -- the mechanics of the caper, the grafted-on wit and wisdom -- starts to feel repetitious and a tad gimmicky.",
    "Inside Man is irrelevant, another semi-high-tech mega-heist movie, the rhythms and tropes of which we are all as familiar with as we are with the wallpaper facing our toilets.",
    "A fairly routine heist drama and a never especially believable puzzle film."

I'm not sure how this film was supposed to translate. As suspense it failed because it telegraphs everything in advance. It has a distracting sublot with a nazi sympathizer that is based on an ubelievable premise. It also has too many A-list actors like Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer doing small parts that are little to work with and that is something I always find distracting.

All in all, this movie No one can deny that this movie has a great cast. The acting is terrific. The directing is classic Spike Lee--brilliant at times, but he takes every chance to work in commentary about race, religion and ethnicity. All in all, this movie presents a good picture and the plot depicts what would be a brilliant heist if it were true. However, there are serious flaws in the plot (which are gracefully glossed over by expert acting), but the end result is that we really don't know the various character's motivations for their behavior. At one point we are told by one of the theives \"I did it for the money\", but that doesn't seem to add up with what was taken. Similarly I'm still trying to figure out exactly what motivated Denzel to bring Jodie a telephone number in one of the last scenes. The sequence of the movie is expertly executed to both provide hints and keep you guessing. Denzel's character is likeable, funny and feels real. Jodie Foster's character is a bit unbelievable in terms of profession. Oh, and keep an eye out for the Albanian woman. I thought she was excellent.",

Sorely lacking in style, this potboiler is all over the place! The writing of Denzel Washington's character is often ridiculous; and he works valiently to overcome it. The only real entertainment value for me were the unintential (I assume) moments of camp; notably, the telephone scene between Denzel and his girlfriend; and the bizarre performance from Jodie Foster, who seems to be trying to channel Ann Coulter! Foster's attempts at being cool and cunning come off as simply laughable. I'm not sure how Christopher Plummer kept a straight face in his scenes with her. For me, only Foster's performance fiasco made this film worth my viewing time. And why was Willem Dafoe's participation needed here? I used to believe Spike was good film director, but a poor screenwriter. After seeing \"Inside Man.\" I now have my doubts about his skills as a director. I think most of the \"names\" signed on for the money.",

Like John Singleton, he may have found his legs as a pulp manufacturer whose least arguable claim to fame is that he can do fast, funny, attitudinal genre films better than Tony Scott. Washington and Foster, for their parts, are merely dukes in a sick kingdom, taking what roles they're offered for people their age (and sex) just to keep their careers afloat in the public brain-pan. Lee is playing the genre like a board game, and his film is a sniggering riff, filled with hyperbolic New York stereotypes, sexist jokes, puns, scattershot commentary on racial profiling and smug banter. As bogus in its way as Richard Donner's 16 Blocks, Inside Man has an even more irritating disrespect for the verities of police work and for the emotional life of urban Americans. There are a few rousing achievements on the table, in particular a comical police debate--instigated by a faux riddle tossed by Owen, about trains, U.S. currency and Grand Central Station--as well as a fast joke involving a Sikh hostage who, outraged by profiling, acknowledges that yes, he can easily hail a cab in Mid-Eastern-cabbie-saturated New York. But heist films are hardly what they used to be; for decades, they were a vehicle for postwar desperation and fatalism, and today the genre has an empty tank of frisson to offer without film noir's acknowledgment of doom. The difference between, say, Stanley Kubrick's 1956 masterpiece The Killing and contemporary daydreams like Inside Man is the difference between a luckless hell on earth and a dull weekend in the Poconos.",

The story is flat out lame, with the super \"surprise\" ending being nothing more than a tired joke. Now it seems that everyone from critics to casual movie goers have been willing to excuse this movie solely based on the great cast. Which would have been understandable, had the acting itself not been the greatest weakness of this pretentious mess. Washington gives one of the worst performances of his career here, playing a sarcastic know-it-all cop who is annoyingly juvenile and devoid of any compelling thoughts or emotions.i.e., he and his partner stare at a female victim's large chest while interogating her, making light of her emotions. (this is supposed to be funny) Foster is also terrible playing a mysterious liason with her own agenda. Dafoe is miscast as a clueless police captain. Owen is the only exception here, suffering through an under-developed role. The movie is ruined by random attempts at comedy, both intentional and unintentional, which ruins any suspense or tension that might have helped it.

To Spike Lee's credit, he can be confident and inventive director, but he still goes for \"film student gimmickry\" when the film would have been better served with more restraint and a tighter focus on the narrative. \"Inside Man\" is entertaining enough as a popcorn flick, but there are better films more deserving of your time.",

It's about the volatile showdown between a determined cop and a perfectionist bank robber is sent spiraling toward disaster when a scheming power broker steps in to take control of the situation in this hair-raising heist flick directed by Spike Lee and starring Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, and Jodie Foster. Dalton Russell (Owen) is a bank robber with a difference. In his quest to execute the perfect heist, Dalton has taken every possible factor into consideration. Dalton's uncanny ability of staying one step ahead of the law thwarts even-tempered Detective Keith Frazier's (Washington) best efforts. But there's another factor at play. The bank president (Christopher Plummer) has requested the services of high-profile negotiator Madeline White (Foster). Despite her commendable track record, Madeline is something of a wild card, and before the day is over, this bank robbery will go down in history as one of the most elaborate heists ever executed. Inside Man's plot is exciting, and the acting by Washington, Owen, and Foster all have a stellar performance of their own. I couldn't have liked it more.",

Unlike Lee's previous dramas, \"Inside Man\" works, even as an action flick, which is a genre that he's never taken before. Like a \"Spike fan\" may suspect, he still keeps that racy energetic tone, and also keeps his film-making old fashioned. Overall, the shots look great, you'll find some sizzling action, plenty of tense sequencing, and a lot of great dialogue. But the aspect that makes \"Inside Man\" a true winner, is the work of the ensemble cast, done by Oscar winning-nominated actors Denzle Washington , Jodie Foster, and Clive Owen. They are all terrific here. The movie does have it's shortcomings though, like the awful music and the corn-ball intro. One thing that I also found unappealing was the pull-off : a conclusion too Denzle's line, \"Come on this aint' no bank robbery!\", that you've probably seen in commercials or trailers. It seemed way too convoluted for such a well-made movie that was perfectly executed for the first 100 minutes.

No, Denzel didn't use a gun and blow stuff up ever chance he got, but he was intelligent and methodical in solving the case.

The photography, tricks and straight, direction, and the unfolding story kept me rapt and on the edge of my seat the whole time. Denzil's character was a bit too self-righteous, but that's ok as the leading character. Jody Foster's performance was enigmatically appropriate, one of her most complex and interesting since she played the single mom in Little Man Tate. She told great stories with small gestures. Kept me guessing until the end and was a lot of fun. (Loved the lady who solved her unpaid ticket problems using a little Albanian.)",

The 'Inside Man' never really tries for greatness, and that's fine by me. An excellent premise (the robbery) is somewhat tempered by so-so dialogue (though there are a few exceptions-I think others have pointed them out). The witness interviews were drawn out and a bit unnecessary. And of course there was the standard racial commentary one can expect from Spike Lee.

The film doesn't work though: All the twists are revealed or amply clear by about the mid-point, so the thing just sort of stops, but doesn't have an ending.  Secondly, Clive Owen steals the papers to bribe Christopher Plummer later, right?  But then why leave the ring and send Denzel to investigate Plummer?  The result of that will be that Plummer's past crimes will be exposed in which case the papers Clive stole become valueless.  Right?",

Owen and Washington were fantastic but sadly never fully used during the film. Lots of needless sub-plots, Lame attempts at misdirection, and the lack of having a fluid plot (where one scene just sort of flows into the next) makes Inside Man the kind of film that just fails to live up to it's potential.\r It's a good enough movie to watch but I think under the direction of another director, It probably could have been great.",

Clive Owen kills it as the bank robber. Really, he and the heist as a whole are what make this film a success. The trickery and deception he employs really make this a fun and entertaining watch. Denzel Washington also has a good turn as the detective, though he certainly takes a back seat to Owen, as well as Jodie Foster who does great in her role as a \"fixer\". As we watch the events unfold, it is very entertaining to watch the head-to-head battles between the three as they all represent competing interests concerning the heist. Finally, the ending is great as we learn how everything transpired. There are still some things that make no sense, but I will let it slide here.\r On the negative side, as with all Spike Lee films, there are parts where race is shoved down your throat. Luckily, it did not choke the life out of this one, but still felt forced, irrelevant to the storyline, and unnecessary. In addition, the camera work is at times spotty and left me scratching my head and wondering why they chose to use that angle or use that effect, etc. Two scenes in particular (one in which Washington's character runs to the bank doors and one in which Foster's character is patted down by one of the bank robbers) where the camera work is annoying and takes you out of the film entirely.",
