Struggling to make ends meet and to raise her daughters, Julia suppresses her own needs and desires to support her family. But the headaches, excruciating migraines, keep coming. Inside her splitting mind, disturbing visions erupt: water, rafters and then the blinding white windows of a warehouse sized room. The space is menacing, mysterious and seductive. The visions intensify and soon there are signs. Julia knows that she must find the room. Desperate, she robs the Bingo hall, abandons her family and flies to New York.  Her pilgrimage has begun.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "For a film about looking for a sign, looking for solace, Room quite brazenly offers neither. It isn't an easy film, but the world's already got plenty of easy and easily digestible films.",
    "Winner of the John Cassavetes Award for Best Feature Under $500K at the 2006 Independent Spirit Awards, Henry's film is beautifully shot and extraordinarily well acted by Williams.",
    "The plot of the indie feature Room is, shall we say, sketchy. But that's a minor annoyance thanks to a gutsy performance by Cyndi Williams and vibrating cinematography by P.J. Raval.",
    "A perceptive, unsettling psychodrama marking the assured feature writing and directing debut of shorts filmmaker Kyle Henry.",
    "One of those rare American indies that confidently and successfully propose their own narrative logic, drawing viewers into a mental puzzle that may not contain a single clear solution.",
    "Room is an existential horror film, a parable of the war against terror being waged in Julia's psyche.",
    "Packs a punch in its first act with a passionate lead performance by Cyndi Williams and a painfully concrete sense of modern life closing in. But gradually it slips into the indie paradigm of an alienated soul rushing into darkness, climaxing with a semiabstract montage sequence that's more rhetorical than dramatic.",
    "Williams does a fine job with her role. I was pulling for her throughout her dreary journey. It's too bad it didn't get anywhere."

She walks into a room, the wrong room; it's a room full of women doing deep relaxation exercises. Julia quietly walks out. Her quest is not a feminist one. So what is the point of Julia's journey? Updates about the Iraqi War stream from televisions and radios throughout \"Room\", which Julia(like you and me) converts largely into background noise, offers a tantalyzing clue to understanding the nature of this woman's vision. Julia, like President Bush, of course, is from Texas. If she's a conservative, maybe the filmmaker is saying that the room doesn't exist, just like how Bush's Iraq doesn't exist. The room is a lie. Julia's journey to New York might be a metaphor for the deployment of our soldiers in Iraq. If your state of mind is a political one, \"Room\" will seem engrossing rather than mind-numbing.",
