To the government's dismay, more and more of the population are being transformed, and they have set out to rid the world of this new subculture that they deem menaces to society.

    "critic_reviews": [
        "For this violent yet gore-free film, clearly designed for horny teenaged video game wizards, writer-director Kurt Wimmer stages a succession of fight sequences that pit V against helmeted thugs who appear to have raided the Star Wars storm trooper costume closet.",
        "To her credit, Jovovich carries out her action-hero duties with swagger and conviction that never get out of control. Clearly, she's expecting a franchise out of this.",
        "Although it looks cool, appearances aren\u2019t everything.",
        "Amid every action cliche in the book, outmoded stereotypes, and a plot derivative of every futuristic drama made in the last fifteen years, Ultraviolet comes off as nothing more than a pale copy of better, more inventive films.",
        "Mr. Wimmer is more concerned with fetishizing his heroine and patronizing his audience. The verdict? Ultrasilly.",
        "Director Kurt Wimmer has an eye for jackboot chic (Equilibrium), and the images here have been digitally polished so that the characters' skin is smoother than porcelain. It's a cool effect--I spent most of this interminable actioner wondering if one could bounce a quarter off Jovovich's bare midriff.",
        "Seems this is yet another puddle of futuristic sludge for us to blame on John Cassavetes.",
        "Ultraviolet, unscreened for critics, is unfit for consumption.",
        "An all-but-incoherent mess whose main components are palpably fake-looking CGI effects, video-game-style action sequences and Milla Jovovich's admirably taut abdomen, Kurt Wimmer's film epitomizes just about everything wrong with post-MATRIX, comic book-/video-game-inspired, Hong Kong-action-style sci-fi thrillers.",
        "Jovovich is bad, and not in a good way. She turns in an epically expressionless performance (maybe she thought it was one of her modeling gigs?) but she sure looks great.",
        "This is another one of those pointless action superhero movies that unfolds like a video game in which the viewer is unable to participate.",
        "A film to be enjoyed only by science-fiction movie completists and middle school boys with extreme cases of attention deficit disorder.",
        "Underdeveloped antagonist Nick Chinlund sums up the entire film during one of his rants about Jovovich's latest casual, offhand slaughter: \"One woman against 14 men! It's ridiculous!\" Well, yeah.",
        "The latest entry in the \"This film is so bad we're not screening it for critics\" genre.",
        "Pic is hermetically sealed in a synthetic wrapping that's so total -- Sony's top-flight high-def cameras, visibly low-budget CG work, exceptionally hackneyed and imitative action and dialogue --that it arrives a nearly lifeless film.",
        "Unengaging, uninspired and unwatchable. A criminal waste of time and talent.",
        "Ultraviolet, warns someone, ''Don't overthink it.'' Sage advice for anyone masochistic enough to watch this pile of poorly pixelated vampire poo.",
        "A cut-rate ripoff of \"Aeon Flux\" with Milla Jovovich as a butt-kicking futuristic heroine in a midriff-baring bodysuit, is ultrastupid, ultra-incoherent, ultrasilly - and way, way ultraboring.",
        "Jovovich, who's shown sensitivity in her dramatic work, looks spectacularly bored as she power-kicks her way through one bloody pile-up after another. That boredom, like the mystery virus at the center of the film, is contagious."

From beginning to end and in every aspect of the production this movie was an utter failure of storytelling. Lame voiceover. Poor special effects. Terrible acting. Terrible sets. Incoherent plot. Idiotic dialogue and moronic character relationships. There is so much more to criticize, but I think the less said about this train wreck the better. Movie execs need to realize that you can create a great, fun, AND logical action movie. Investment in the story, not simply more green screen and cgi effects, must be made. Alas, good stories involve a modicum of intelligence; a commodity woefully lacking in Hollywood. Oh well - I am sure \"Ultraviolet II: The Revioleting\" is in the pipeline!",

Don't let my rating fool you, this movie is horrible, I mean REALLY horrible. My rating is based on the fact that I had a blast watching it in the theater and laughing at it. I kid you not, the final fight scene takes place in pitch dark. I guess they burned through their special effects budget showing the same 5 idiotic looking 'troupers' getting mowed down again and again. The plot goes beyond nonsensical; the main character's motivations are completely inscrutable. Early in the movie she claims she 'hate's all humans' and wants to kill them all. Five minutes later (seriously, I'm not exaggerating here) she's massacring every vampire she can find, including some that were previously her friends and compatriots to protect a human child who's going to die in a couple of hours anyway. If you've ever gotten a kick out of watching a truly terrible piece of cinema with some friends I whole-heartedly recommend this movie. But if you're expecting a serious movie avoid it all costs. It is terrible, as in 'it might give you leprosy' terrible.",

This film has anything but. First of all, when the awfully rendered CGI is capable of taking you completely OUT of a sci-fi film, (helicoptor/motorcycle chase scene, anyone?) you know things have went horribly wrong. Couple that with an overly elaborate and non sensical plot involving vampires? and a creepy mute kid who may (or may not) be the savior of the universe, then you know the director is grasping for something, anything to make this movie a stand-out in the unfortunate (Thanks Alien!) age of the now tired trend of kick butt heroines in the Tomb Raider/Resident Evil/Aeon Flux/Elektra vein. Do your self a favor folks, just wait for it to hit the Wal-Mart DVD clearance bin, which is where it'll be headed to in about a year.

I heard all of the negative press concerning \"Ultraviolet\" going in, but despite it all, i kept telling myself \"this is the guy who made EQUILIBRIUM. I will give it a fighting chance\". It saddens me to say that, for the most part, all of the bad stuff that you've heard concerning \"ULTRAVIOLET\" is true. Part of the blame falls on Milla Jovavich. We have to face it: She is no Christian Bale. She just does not possess the acting skills to carry a film. She's damned pretty to look at, but man, was that performance terrible. Another part of the problem seemed to be that director Wimmer was attempting to take all of the elements that worked in \"Equilibrium\", and then amp them up to the EXTREME. He sort of \"TEMPLE OF DOOMED\" this one, by going TOOO far with everything. The action is quite often incoherent, and some of the CGI is horrid. The epic one-liners are just cheesy. And there seems to be more logical reason that these people had to be VAMPIRES. That NEVER ONCE plays into the story. A missed element, or a pointless one, i don't know. That's not to say this movie is COMPLETELY without redemption. The colouring looks GREAT, and there are some neat gadgets for scifi fanatics (love those disposable phones!

Instead, they gave me a PG-13 rated version that absolutely makes no sense because this was originally supposed to be an R-rated effort to promote the movie in the style of my favorite cult classic action movies \"Equilibrium\" (FYI, it was supposed to be a spiritual successor to the film) and adding insult to injury, some of the fight scenes had to be taken out due to time constrainsts and the confusing story which is entirely featured Violet's parents killed by the resistance instead of Violet's demise just absolutely rubbish. The director of the film did a terrible job along with a use of underutilized CGI special effects that seemed to run its own course and Ultraviolet's backstory is outdated (if you read the novel, that's where she tells the story all by herself). Even worse, the theatrical version is exactly 88 minutes too short (if you compare to the unrated version which is almost 1 minute). Ultraviolet is less like a video game movie but with little or more than a clone of Tomb Raider. The Blu-Ray version is also horrendous but sadly it doesn't have any extras. Skip it!

Come on Kurt, really?) and... what's his name, the bad guy, with SILVER PLUGS IN HIS NOSE... ugh. I hope he never lives it down! There are a couple of plotholes: for one, the movie's over, but now Violet is going to die offscreen and Six will probably kick the bucket sometime soon due to Violet turning him into a hemophage. Also, the bad guy was a clean freak. WHY? He was a hemophage ALL ALONG, he didn't need to act like he was uber paranoid about the virus. Speaking of which, HOW HAS HE LIVED FOR SO LONG? He was the first person to be infested with the virus! Christ! Now, i've given this movie 3 for a couple reasons: I have the DVD version, which includes a commentary. It gets a bit dull sometimes, but Milla is one of the better commentators. She shared stories about on the set, she cracked a few jokes, she named a few techniques you see in the film. Very fun.
