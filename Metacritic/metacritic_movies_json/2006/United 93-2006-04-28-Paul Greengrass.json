    "critic_reviews": [
        "Greengrass has made not only a thoroughly fact-checked film but a film that uncontrovertibly comes from the heart.",
        "Brilliant, tightly focused, and momentous.",
        "Greengrass\u2019s movie is tightly wrapped, minutely drawn, and, no matter how frightening, superbly precise.",
        "United 93 is powerful not only in the way it provides hope through the actions of a few unlikely heroes, but in its ability to take us back through time to a day many of us would prefer not to remember, but will never forget.",
        "An unflinching, powerfully visceral and haunting portrait of the tragic events aboard one of the terrorist-commandeered flights on the fateful morning of Sept. 11, 2001.",
        "May be the most wrenching, profound and perfectly made movie nobody wants to see.",
        "It is the highest compliment I can pay Greengrass to say that he is a master of the mundane, the routine and the everyday.",
        "Far from being exploitive, the effect is inspiring: This is the best of us.",
        "The controversial film that is unbearable--and unmissable.",
        "What United 93 demonstrates, as if we needed proof, is that it is too soon - it may always be too soon - to sort out the feelings from that day.",
        "You\u2019re unlikely to come across a more powerful film this year.",
        "One of the most harrowing, viscerally upsetting films ever made.",
        "The superb United 93, from the British writer-director Paul Greengrass, does not waste time defining the undefinable. Nor does it strain for poetry when, with this story, prose is enough.",
        "It's Greengrass' way of asking a question that looms large in these post-9/11 days: Are we all praying to the same God, or is one man's God better than another, and one man's God vastly more terrifying?",
        "This is a masterful and heartbreaking film, and it does honor to the memory of the victims.",
        "There's no cheap uplift to their victory, no pop catharsis. What's great about United 93 is that you never feel it's just a movie - even though, as a movie, it's terrific.",
        "I am here to tell you that Greengrass has fashioned one of the most powerful films I have ever seen, and that watching it makes you value your loved ones and your privileges more, perhaps, than you ever have. He has made a film that makes you feel, makes you think and makes you want to connect. And that, finally, might be the greatest thing that art can do.",
        "Impossible to recommend as a great Friday night out, yet agonisingly vital as thought-urging cinema.",
        "Paul Greengrass and his cinematographer Barry Ackroyd have created an intestinally powerful and magnificent memorial to the passengers of that doomed flight. It is the film of the year. I needed to lie down in a darkened room afterwards. So will you.",
        "Pulling the bandage of sentiment cleanly away from oozing concepts like ''heroism'' and ''our nation's war on terror'' in the aftermath of recent wounds, here's a drama about the most politically charged crisis of our time that grants the dignity of autonomy to every soul involved.",
        "A respectful, accomplished, non-exploitative piece of historical filmmaking and -- for audiences -- a gripping white-knuckle ride all the way.",
        "The result is a tense, documentary-style drama that methodically builds a sense of dread despite the preordained outcome.",
        "United 93 unfolds with the terrible inevitability of a modern-day \"Battle of Algiers,\" with Greengrass exerting superb control of tone, structure and pace...United 93 may be the best movie I ever hated.",
        "Instead of using actors, Greengrass employed many of the actual air traffic controllers and military commanders who were on the ground that day. Also aiding his film's universality is Greengrass' use of little known actors in the central roles, preventing stardom from affecting our ideas about heroism and patriotism.",
        "It's a long, brutal and honest look at a shattering event some Americans would apparently prefer not to see depicted - but also a respectful, inspiring one that's in no way exploitative or emotionally manipulative.",
        "I wouldn't recommend the movie to anyone, but if the families of the victims take something positive from it, as their cooperation with Greengrass suggests they do, that's justification enough.",
        "The movie is hard going, not least in the sense of powerlessness it leaves in an audience that knows exactly what will happen. And yet you come out feeling that the filmmakers have done the right thing by these people, and by this day.",
        "There's nothing about United 93 that qualifies as entertainment in the traditional sense: It is an unpleasant, wrenching experience, which is just as it should be.",
        "Best understood as a memorial\u2026Like most memorials, it is respectful, premised on competing obligations to the dead and the living, and eager to stress that the deaths were not in vain. It not only tells us we should never forget but also illustrates how we should remember.",
        "This is first-rate, visceral filmmaking, no question: taut, watchful, free of false histrionics, as observant of the fear in the young terrorists' eyes as the hysteria in the passenger cabin, and smart enough to know this material doesn't need to be sensationalized or sentimentalized.",
        "It's an expertly made picture that I wish I could stamp out of my mind. What's the value of artistry that sucks the life out of you?",
        "It\u2019s a mark of Greengrass\u2019 unequaled gift for believably re-creating reality that, once seen, it\u2019s impossible to get United 93 out of your mind, no matter how much you may want to.",
        "Greengrass takes pains to keep events believable and relatively unrhetorical, rejecting entertainment for the sake of sober reflection, though one has to ask how edifying this is apart from its reduction of the standard myths.",
        "We all lived through this not so long ago; it's an odd thing to make a film whose most striking effect is its ability to bring the feelings of Sept. 11 flooding back, then close on a profoundly disturbing note. A crasser film would have been easier to digest and dismiss. It's hard to do either with United 93, and that's either its genius or its folly.",
        "There's just nothing artful about it, and it's Greengrass who deserves the credit. These nonactors don't act the way most people do when playing themselves. They act the way people do when they're being themselves.",
        "Greengrass's reluctance to unduly demonize the villains or overly sentimentalize the victims is commendable on the surface, but it tends to blur the two sides and to mask the gulf that separates them.",
        "Its focus is purposely narrow. But that narrow focus, along with the lack of fully realized characters, and the absence of any historical or political context, raises the question of why, notwithstanding the usual (if shaky) commercial imperative, this particular movie was made.",
        "To see the flight captain and co-pilot checking the plane before takeoff, to watch the varied passengers settling into their seats, is more agonizing than watching passengers board the ship in all those \"Titanic\" films. With United 93 we see these people unknowingly stepping into a history that is still in terrible process. But as a work in (let's call it) the Akhmatova mode, it does not and could not succeed.",
        "United 93, as grueling as it was to sit through, left me feeling curiously unmoved and even slightly resentful."

I doubt that a \" box office smash hit\" was the producer's primary motive for making the film. If it was to be a money maker he would have appealed to the larger audience and given them what they wanted; whatever that exaggeration may have been. Also, 10% of the ticket price is going to the families of UAL93 till today ( at least in this area). I heard one of the family members on the radio this morning and they were very pleased with how accurate and respectful the movie was to the subject. It was more a documentary than a movie. There was no need to dramatize this subject. It was a look into how the events of 9/11 as well as UAL 93, threw the passengers, the crew, the Air Traffic Control, and the military, (and much the world) into shock, confusion, fear, anger and action. It gave a perspective of those involved. It showed how we were unprepared for such an attack. We have hopefully learned and will not let something like this happen again. I found the Documentary by the two French Brothers \"9/11\" to be much more \"disturbing\" since it was all real footage of the event... I'm glad though that the producer did ask many of the families their opinion about making this movie. What I found beneficial about this movie was that it has (will) give an opportunity for those who want to know, the probable story that unfolded relative to flight 93. I know that I always think of the twin towers and the pentagon but not UAL 93. I won't over look it any more. Who knows what may have happened if this aircraft completed its goal? There are those who want to remember and those that do not. People will remember in their own ways. I personally am glad I saw this movie. I feel we are letting down our guard when we become complacent. We are foolishly opening ourselves up for another strike. I want to make them work very hard for their next one. And I do believe it is coming. Maybe that is the question. Who believes the threat of 9/11 still remains? Are those the people who are going to see this movie? I know we all wish it was a simple situation and had a even more simple solution: But it does not. We are at war. I feel for the families and passangers of UAL 93. This movie honors them well.",

One of the things so impressive about it was how he portrayed the terrorists. He didn't create them to be evil goons who were out to destroy the world; he showed how emotional they became and also showed how they prayed and conversed with their Muslim Gods.

As it is, we are left with a film that has either a completely distinct location from any film ever shot or a film with no location at all. Frankly, after watching it, I don't care which. I remember 9/11 and it hurt me. Watching this film at times allowed me to remember that pain, but not to deal with it, not to understand it in a different way, and not to feel it more deeply than I originally had, so I say phooey.

This flight, and the rest of the flights, were CONTROLLED BY REMOTE BEACON, NOT HI-JACKED by \"Muslims\" (why are 8 of the 19 \"hi-jackers\" STILL ALIVE, and why are their names NOT on the final flight compliments of any of the airliners?  Hmmmm?).  They're trying to convince you that the people's cellphones actually WORKED at that altitude?  Pleeeease.  Oh, and a bunch of passengers charged the \"Muslim Hi-jackers\" with \"box-cutters\"?  Riiiiiiiight.  This movie was so factually inaccurate it was almost hilarious.  Many will scream that I am \"dishonoring the memories of the victims\" by writing this.  On the contrary, I'm honoring them by asking some very disturbing questions and seeking answers.  \"United 93\" is a LIE, people.  Get the facts before you make an emotional judgement.",

I found the film endlessly taut and gripping, yet respectful and profound throughout its execution. My hat's off to Greengrass and crew for doing things right without resorting to the tired trappings of Hollywood. Utilizing a cast with little to no name equity was precisely the right thing to do.

The first half of the movie A brilliant film that I could not give a 10, because it is painful to watch at times, as it probably should be. The film unfolds in almost real-time, focusing only on the events over US airspace on that morning. The first half of the movie mostly deals with the frenzied disbelief of those controlling and protecting the airspace, and gradually works it way down to the mesmerizing, and painful final 30 minutes on board flight 93. It is a small movie about a huge event, and that's what makes it work. It is a well-crafted, and tightly knit thriller, with excellent pacing, and, even though you know what will happen, you'll still watch with both anticipation and horror. Other reviews complain about a lack of context and character development, but, I think we all have a context for these events, and the whole point of the film is that these were just people doing what they needed to do. The smattering of personal information is still enough, that when the passengers make those final cell-phone calls to their families, it remains gut-wrenching. Their final decision to storm the terrorists is a simple one, made from circumstance, and highlights the fact that heroic actions are not those of grand plans and designs, but of necessity, to prevent harm to others. If you are not ready to re-live that day from another perspective, then don't see this film, but if you are, you will likely experience some painful emotions, but you may well be rewarded with some greater understanding.",

I get what the film maker is doing here...replicating fear, drama, and all the other things you need in a highjacking movie. I was awed by the performances, however, despite how this movie would be nothing without the tragedy it refers to. It must have been hard for some of them to act out things like this, and I respect that. But a lousy film is a lousy film. I felt no sense of true sympathy, enthrallment, sadness, or any emotion for that matter. It was sort of a heoic film that came across as more of a \"Just so you know, these people risked their lives and yada yada yada...\" no. When I see a film I don't like to feel as if someone is trying to prove that an event was great. The event stands on its own. It's only five years old. Which might be why some of the kick is gone because it will never forget 9/11. Some might say I'm unpatriotic for not being entertained or enlightened by a film that is so obviously going to have impact...I'm sorry but we don't need a reminder as to how terrible 9/11 was and we don't need another plane movie.

The mechanics of air traffic control on 9/11 and the internal havoc the hijackings caused that day are intensely represented in riveting sequence after riveting sequence. The final scenes and those where incomplete information exists might leave some viewers wishing for more but the film has many qualities beyond that to offer and is thought provoking on many levels.

I simply could not anticipate the pit in my stomach. It was amazing how real this was and how it triggered the emotions of that very day. The cast of unknowns was phenonmenal and direction was brillant. This truly speaks to the heroism the country witnessed during and following this tragedy.",

I'm trying to analyze the movie for that - just a movie- nothing more. It's hard to criticize movies like this because they are not really meant to entertain - how can someone be entertained by terroism? They are more ment to inform, to make us remember. First off I saw the rave reviews and thought \"I gatta see that!\" I even had to do some convincing with a friend for a week or so before she agreed to go with me. Well, to sum it up, I was very disappointed. The first hour plus was extremely borning (on an entertainment level) with people in command centers calling one another, and a whole lot of people pointing to small little X's on screens going \"Possible hijack! Possible hijack!\" I probably heard that phrase 100 times in that hour, no joke. Well, maybe a little exaduration. Anyhow, the good part was when the people actually overtook the plane and made it crash. Well, not good that it crashed, just that was the exciting and thrilling part. Let's just say I didn't leave the movie with joy in my heart, but It did make me remember what our country has gone through and ALMOST make my cry (no movie has ever made me cry). If you want to leave a movie sad, be reminded of terrorism, but at the same time pay your tribute to those who gave yoru lives, see this movie. If you want to go to a movie for entertainment, to go with your girl, to leave happy, to feel entertained, etc, go see something else and wait until maybe 9/11/06 and watch it in a dark room with some kleenex as you remember those who lost their lives.",

I loved that there was little or no \"mood music\", no sentimental speeches... and the hand held shots gave me the feeling of witnessing the ordinary becoming extraordinary. It is a subtling chilling film about such a sensitive event. Breath deep and be brave and just watch the morning on Flight 93 unfold.
