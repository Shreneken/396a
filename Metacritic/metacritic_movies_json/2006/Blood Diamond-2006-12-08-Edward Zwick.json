  "critic_reviews": [
    "Essentially a romantic adventure story with politics in the background--an old-fashioned movie, I suppose, but exciting and stunningly well made.",
    "Action-adventure pictures have a lamentable tendency toward mindlessness, but Edward Zwick's epic story has numerous virtues apart from suspense and spectacle.",
    "Not that Diamond skimps on the social commentary; far from it. But it makes its points without too much breast-beating, caching its polemic within a tough-minded entertainment.",
    "A visually sumptuous, bullet-train-paced thriller with a really provocative theme.",
    "Blood Diamond is a gem in a season with lots of worthy movies.",
    "As strong as Blood Diamond is in its best moments, I wish it had been even harder-edged. DiCaprio is remarkable - his work is almost on par with his performance this year in \"The Departed.\"",
    "Zwick's narrative skills keep us hooked on the story, and the first-rate production values and imaginative use of locations (it was shot in Mozambique) give the film an enthralling scope and epic sweep.",
    "There are times when his message threatens to overwhelm his story line, and the last 15 minutes or so of Blood Diamond demonstrate what happens when sentimentality wins out over style and grit.",
    "Given that the movie doesn't have a single narrative surprise--you always know where it's going and why, commercially speaking, it's going there--it's amazing how good Blood Diamond is. I guess that's the surprise.",
    "For its flaws, Blood Diamond is a gem, if only for being an unusually smart, engaged popcorn flick.",
    "Great performances, provocative ideas and gripping action scenes fall prey to Hollywood logic and pat storytelling in the final hour.",
    "It's a solid performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, who has grown into this sort of \"gritty\" role and is more believable after having been seen dancing on the dark side in \"The Departed.\"",
    "Blood Diamond is, in the vernacular of Old Hollywood, a rip-roaring adventure, the kind made in the '30s with Clark Gable and the handiest leading lady on contract at MGM.",
    "To the unlikely role of a Bogart-esque reluctant hero, Leonardo DiCaprio brings an intensity that compels even when the script falters.",
    "There's no use griping about the superfluous white-on-white romance that generates so much dead space in Zwick's movie, for without it Blood Diamond would never have been made. Which would be a pity, for as liberal hand-wringing goes, it's a winner.",
    "Blood Diamond attempts to be an action thriller with serious political overtones, to be as much position paper as \"Zulu Dawn.\"",
    "Blood Diamond is a by-the-numbers message picture, to be sure...But the director, Edward Zwick, is craftsman enough that the pace never slackens, the chase scenes thrill, and the battle scenes sicken. And if it makes viewers think twice about buying their sweethearts that hard-won hunk of ice for Christmas, so much the better.",
    "Blood Diamond only skims the surface of many important subjects--the script doesn't begin to explain what the civil war was about. But if it opens a few eyes, it will have done its job.",
    "DiCaprio, here as in \"The Departed,\" proves himself the most watchful and watchable actor of his age. Since his teens, he has known how to make moral dilemmas seem both profound and sexy, and at 32 he just keeps getting better.",
    "Edward Zwick brings unimpeachable good intentions to his film about the bloody underbelly of the international diamond trade, but when social conscience jockeys for attention with movie-star glamour, glamour always wins. The result is a rip-snorting adventure set against the backdrop of African misery.",
    "There's an extraordinary subplot in Blood Diamond, sandwiched between a main story meant to arouse outrage and a Hollywood-clumsy finale meant to provoke a standing ovation.",
    "It's earnest, but it feels beside the point. Blood Diamond's real point: box office.",
    "As an entry in the advocacy-entertainment genre, in which glamorous movie stars bring our attention to the plight of the less fortunate, Blood Diamond is superior to 2003's ridiculous \"Beyond Borders\" while looking strident and obvious next to last year's \"The Constant Gardener.\"",
    "The combination of DiCaprio's soulful, self-effacing work in Scorsese's \"The Departed,\" and this unexpectedly complex portrait in a simple-minded movie, make it the best year of his career since the big boat crash of 1997.",
    "Africa's enduring sorrow is ripe for drama, but Blood Diamond is, finally, a fitting metaphor for the gems: Potentially brilliant from a distance, but upon closer inspection, one likely will see the flaws.",
    "It's a reasonably entertaining actioner, and Zwick doesn't shy away from depicting violence or the horrors of war, but as a social statement it falls a little short. And emeralds are prettier anyway.",
    "Preachy infotainment that wants to offer thrills, too -- an uneasy hybrid.",
    "There is every reason to learn about the link between jewels and death, by all means, but no reason to try to disguise a term paper as entertainment.",
    "De Beers can relax; the only indignation stirred up by Blood Diamond won't be among those who worry about where their jewelry came from, but with audiences incensed by facile politics and bad storytelling.",
    "While the film never quite reaches the emotional peaks it so obviously seeks to scale, Zwick's film is still potent enough to save you three months salary.",
    "Much like Zwick's \"Glory\" and \"The Last Samurai,\" Blood Diamond strives to be an \"important\" film while stopping well short of being genuinely provocative and artistically chancy.",
    "While Mr. DiCaprio turns out to be an ideal fit for Blood Diamond, there's an insolvable disconnect between this serious story and the frivolous way it has been told. There is no reason to doubt the filmmakers' sincerity; only their filmmaking.",
    "It's like watching \"The Treasure of Sierra Madre\" as remade by \"Nightline.\"",
    "It's part action film, part buddy movie, part love story, part political tract and, in sum, much less: a meandering, preachy, condescending mess that only occasionally bursts into life and even then at such a tepid level that you can hardly call it living.",
    "DiCaprio is terrific, but he can't save this lecture from the shame of using Africa as a vehicle for another white man's redemption.",
    "The one attraction in the picture is DiCaprio's performance: easy yet strong, confident, humorous.",
    "DiCaprio and Connelly give off the sexual tension of pickled herring.",
    "Director Edward Zwick tried to make a great movie, but somewhere in the process he forgot to make a good one."

Yet, the box office viewing is evidence of what America does to Africa on a general level (turning a blind eye) that it's no surprise it never earned a #1 spot. Still, I believe it to be one of the best movies I've seen this year. Leonardo DiCaprio, similar to his performance in The Departed, is believable, strong, and convincing. The story is strong; the cinematography is excellent; and overall, Blood Diamond does everything I want a movie to do (to educate, captivate, and be enjoyable).",

They then drastically simplifed the issues to the point of distortion so we could all feel moved without actually being edified. What's the source of the problem? Simple! Greedy evil big diamond industry (even though they are the last people to benefit from buying conflict diamonds and encouraging even more flood of illicit stones into the market which is already over-stocked) and stupid greedy shallow Western consumers! What's the solution? Simple! We have to ignore the voice of Africa no more (whatever that means) and...oh...please check for a certificate that the diamond you are buying is non-conflict.

Putting it lightly, the movie certainly presents some significant problems facing those who live in Sierra Leonne. When I step back though and consider my emotions I am left wondering what to do with them. Sure I am filled with some rage and compassion for those who are affected by this \"blood diamond\" business but if I fail to do anything with my emotions, if I fail to act, did the movie serve any purpose? Ultimately the movie does an excellent job of articulating a problem but fails to answer with a solution.\r Personally I am a Christian and when I take a minute to ponder the horrific nature with which diamonds are found and distributed I question their need. As a Christian I walk away and begin to think of the responsibility I have to be aware of people suffering around the world and not only must I be aware but I must seek justice for people embattled in a place like Sierra Leonne. So what should the response be towards this movie? Well, I personally know a woman who made sure her husband bought her an engagement ring that did not cost someones life. I too should push towards a similar response. Too often Christians are seen as legalistic or too removed from the culture. I am here to say, Christians must stay in tune and care about social ills while holding fast to our belief in Christ.",

I generally dislike him and feel that he has been woefully miscast in films like \"The Gangs of New York\" and \"The Aviator\".

He is dragged down a bit by the dopey role Jennifer Connelly plays, but he is totally believable in this role. At its heart, this film focuses on human stories, and this apparently disappoints those that expected a political film. The mostly incomprehensible politics whirl around the characters in a way that is more realistic than a preachy documentary approach would have been.

There is some graphic violence, but just enough to make you think about it, not thrown at you so it becomes the story like in Apocolypto. The credits are all superlative, especially Eduardo Serra's camera work and the production design of Dan Weil. The acting is a revelation. Jennifer Connelly brings truth and compassion to her role as a journalist in the midst of a civil war. Djimon Hounsou once again is extraordinary, why Hollywood hasn't caught on to what Speilberg saw in him for Amistad is beyond me. The man just oozes passion in his work. And then there's Leo. In The Departed earlier this year, I saw him become a mature actor who held his own with Nicholson, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin as part of a dynamic ensemble, and now in Blood Diamond, DiCaprio becomes a Leading Actor, not a big Movie Star, but an actor's Actor. His performance is stellar, right down to the accent. We may have lost Brando and George C. Scott, but Leonardo DiCaprio is the \"veteran\" new guy stepping into their shoes!

I must say that I have been spoiled by the brilliance of great independent filmmaking like that of Babel, Little Children, or the magnificently underseen Half Nelson. It is because of this that I found myself One of my top ten films of 2006. I must say that I have been spoiled by the brilliance of great independent filmmaking like that of Babel, Little Children, or the magnificently underseen Half Nelson. It is because of this that I found myself attempting to judge this films cliches early on. However, by the end of this film I could not deny it's power. Director Edward Zwick (Glory, Courage Under Fire, The Last Samurai) is known for taking on very big subjects in a bold, but Hollywood entertainment sort of way. This film has all the excitement of a summer blockbuster and definately looks like a big budget action flick. What sets aside Zwick films from the traditional Hollywood lame ducks is his uncompromised ability to take very obvious message dialogue and, through great casting, make it believable. This film will win no award for screenplay, but the acting is top notch. Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou both give Academy Award worthy performances with Jennifer Connelly channeling that wonderful on-screen presence that makes her one of the most enjoyable actresses to grace the silver screen. What also must be pointed out about this movie is its wonderful cinematography. The film is filled with luscious landscapes and I don't believe they could have been captured any better. Africa never looked so beautiful. You will find some of the weaker minded internet critics point the negativity used towards black Africa and use that as a weapon against films like this and one of last years best films The Constant Gardner. Do not be fooled by this simplistic analysis of these films. Africa is an ugly place, or as DiCaprio's Danny Archer would call it a \" god forsaken continent.\" But what movies like Blood Diamond are saying is that there are good people in Africa and if we do our global part we can one day make Africa as beautiful as it's landscape. If only by simply choosing not to buy diamonds until the big corporations start showing some accountability. A lesson I think even the current government needs a reminder of.",

That's not precisely accurate--even though Back in 1997, when Titanic was breaking all kinds of box office records and creating a few of its own, Leonardo DiCaprio suddenly started being touted in some circles as \"the new Gable\". That's not precisely accurate--even though Titanic was in many ways this generation's Gone With The Wind, Clark Gable's best characterizations (GWTW, San Fransisco, The Misfits) were mixtures of darkness and light while DiCaprio's Jack Dawson was nothing BUT light. Fast forward to nearly a decade later and who'd have anticipated DiCaprio as the new Bogart? Forget his British accent: Blood Diamond in some ways is Casablanca all over again, with the big honkin' precious stone that he and Djimon Hounsou form an uneasy partnership over filling in for the letters of transit. DiCaprio has grown and toughened more in a shorter period of time than any other contemporary actor that comes to mind: as recently as 2002's Gangs of New York he wore the cynicism and amorality demanded of him like an ill-fitting mask; now, with this and The Departed, it's come to fit him like a glove. Leading lady Jennifer Connelly does extremely well here too: after what seems like years of playing glum women carrying the world on their shoulders (which she excels at, as A Beautiful Mind and House of Sand and Fog clearly prove) it's a joy to see her smile, laugh and do repartee with equal skill! The movie itself is a smooth, handsomely made and entertaining action film with an ambitious social agenda: it not only wants to, like Hotel Rwanda, open Western eyes and hearts to the bloody atrocities Africans commit upon one another in Hatfield/ McCoy-like tribal skirmishes, but influence our pocketbooks by getting us NOT to buy jewelry sold by those who profit from and promulgate said conflicts. (The central--and perhaps unintended--question brought up in movies like this, which has reemerged anew with Saddam's execution, is so unanswerable it almost qualifies as a Buddhist koan; namely, if colonialist or dictatorial rule keeps the lid on decades and centuries of tribal resentments which would explode in endless bloodbaths if removed, is it possible that maybe iron-fist rule isn't ENTIRELY a bad thing?) Director Ed Zwick, who specializes in thoughtful historical epics and contemporary thrillers wrapped around such thinking-person's heartthrobs as Dicaprio, Denzel Washington, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise, works slickly and seamlessly but intelligently, avoiding many of the standard mistakes (such as having DiCaprio and Hjonsou be buddies); his directorial trademark seems to be the use of one piece of explicit gore to represent an entire canvas of violence--remember the soldier's head being blown off in Glory or the theatergoer's arm doing the same in The Siege? My central difficulty with Blood Diamond lies in Hjonsou's characterization (NOT his performance, which is typically powerful). He seems to have two and only two dramatic functions: to reclaim his son from the rebel army that has kidnapped, enslaved and brainwashed the youth, turning him and other children into something not far removed from George A. Romero's zombies, and to turn DiCaprio's cynical opportunist into a better person. This is the Noble Negro syndrome, most famously exhibited by runaway slave Jim in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and cafe piano player Sam in Casablanca; both are honorable creations, but have been duplicated too many times to serve as much more than an all-too convenient and arbitrary literary device, no matter how well played...and anyway, Hjonsou is certainly a nuanced enough actor (as In America demonstrates) to warrant and deserve characters with a few more layers and complexities. This does a lot to explain why Zwick's strengths and limitations as a filmmaker parallel those of his more famously socially conscious predecessor Stanley Kramer, and why Blood Diamond, as watchable as it is, is ultimately too schematic to be anything more than a good night of movie escapism, which is precisely what I'm sure Zwick DOESN'T want it to be...and why it's not causing QVC jewelry hostesses Jane Treacy and Lisa Robertson to lose any sleep over inability to meet their sales quotas.",

And not coincidentally, the action scenes \"Blood Diamond\", to the filmmaker's credit, is self-aware of its overt pop entertainment elements. The first Sierra Leonean soldier Danny(Leonardo DiCaprio) talks to goes by the name of Rambo. And not coincidentally, the action scenes in \"Blood Diamond\" are indistinguishable from some innocuous violent film with a high body count. The human carnage is supposed to be sobering, but its not. \"Blood Diamond\" isn't \"The Killing Fields\". There's no scene in which the dead Africans are truly mourned. We end up caring more about Danny's fate. His cohort Maddy(Jennifer Connelly) seems like a stand-in for the filmmaker(or screenwriter) when she says what Danny is thinking; that she's \"exploiting their grief.\" Her former beau described her as an \"action junkie\"(a possible reference to the film's target audience, or the screenwriter's sensibility), but that \"[she] give[s] a sh*t\"(a possible reference to the writer's social consciousness, but concessions are necessary in order to get the film green-lighted). \"Hotel Rwanda\" was a mainstream film, but the spectacle never got in the way of its message.",

The images of child soldiers and violence against masses of innocent people were so jarring. Perhaps because I wasn't expecting to be so moved, I ended up weeping at the atrocities of civil war. Leonardo was spectacular, as was Djimon. Jennifer was about as emotionally poignant as a log and it ruined a key part of the story. Also, it is a titch too long. Altogether wonderfully entertaining (in a disturbing way...).",

DiCaprio certainly deserves the accolades he's received for this role, and I thought his accent was quite convincing. Djimon performed excellently as well. Only 2 things bothered me (and only slightly): when the air strike occured, I had a hard time believing ONE helicopter had THAT much firepower; and the last 10 minutes or so might have been a little too much. Aside from those, an excellent film worthy of a 9.1/10",

Jennifer Connelly was also great in her role and she is one of the most under-rated actresses. I also didn't detect any anti-semitism that was mentioned by another poster. While it's true that there are a lot of Jewish interests in diamond mines, particular in South Africa, this was not mentioned or implied in this movie. Please don't try to find anti-semitism where there is none. Just enjoy the film.",
