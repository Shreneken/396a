    "summary": "In this companion piece to \"Flags of Our Fathers,\" Clint Eastwood presents the untold story of the Japanese soldiers and their general who 61 years ago defended against the invading American forces on the island of Iwo Jima.  (Warner Bros.)",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "It's unprecedented, a sorrowful and savagely beautiful elegy that can stand in the company of the greatest antiwar movies.",
        "Clint Eastwood's profound, magisterial, and gripping companion piece to his ambitious meditation on wartime image and reality, \"Flags of Our Fathers.\"",
        "Eastwood's direction here is a thing of beauty, blending the ferocity of the classic films of Akira Kurosawa (Seven Samurai) with the delicacy and unblinking gaze of Yasujiro Ozu (Tokyo Story).",
        "A few scenes serve as hinges joining this movie to \"Flags of Our Fathers.\" While Letters From Iwo Jima seems to me the more accomplished of the two films -- by which I mean that it strikes me as close to perfect -- the two enrich each other, and together achieve an extraordinary completeness.",
        "Letters From Iwo Jima, takes audiences to a place that would seem unimaginable for an American director. Daring and significant, it presents a picture from life's other side, not only showing what wartime was like for our Japanese adversaries on that island in the Pacific but also actually telling the story in their language. Which turns out to be no small thing.",
        "It takes a filmmaker possessed of a rare, almost alchemic, blend of maturity, wisdom and artistic finesse to create such an intimate, moving and spare war film as Clint Eastwood has done in Letters From Iwo Jima.",
        "\"Letters\" isn't about numbers or the battle or even the morality of war. It's about the sanctity of life and how we value our own.",
        "Taken together, Eastwood's masterworks - two of the best films of 2006 - may be Hollywood's last word on World War II.",
        "Letters from Iwo Jima isn't just the film that Eastwood wanted to make, but one that the film's producer Steven Spielberg had tried to make twice with \"Empire of the Sun\" and \"Saving Private Ryan.\"",
        "The word masterpiece costs nothing to write and means less than nothing in an age when every third picture and each new Clint Eastwood project is proclaimed as such. After two viewings, however, Letters From Iwo Jima strikes me as the peak achievement in Eastwood's hallowed career.",
        "It has few stars familiar to Americans, and it shares with \"Pan's Labyrinth\" the rare distinction of being a mainstream commercial movie with subtitles.",
        "Eloquent, bloody, and daringly simple.",
        "One of the great war movies - or antiwar movies - of all time.",
        "Overall, the effect is presumably what Eastwood wanted: we are present at a momentous event, not watching a movie.",
        "Clint Eastwood's Letters From Iwo Jima is his companion piece to \"Flags of Our Fathers\" and in almost every way is superior.",
        "Ironically, the challenge of directing a Japanese-language film with a non-English-speaking cast seems to have brought out the very best in Eastwood. His vision is alternately intimate and sweeping, his touch never seemed more light and sure, and several of his scenes are so delicate, dynamic and prototypically Japanese they could have been directed by Akira Kurosawa.",
        "Letters isn't a fun night at the picture show. It's slow and gloomy and achingly tragic. But it's a truly impressive achievement both in moviemaking and in its understanding of history.",
        "Now Eastwood turns on a dime and tackles not just his first war movie but two war movies of considerable scope and complexity. If he doesn't nail everything perfectly, he nevertheless has created a vivid memorial to the courage on both sides of this battle and created an awareness in the public consciousness at a most opportune moment about how war feels to those lost in its fog.",
        "Taken together, \"Flags\" and \"Letters\" represent a genuinely imposing achievement, one that looks at war unflinchingly -- that does not deny its necessity but above all laments the human loss it entails.",
        "Terse is the word for Eastwood's directorial style. It rarely editorializes; it doesn't emote or orate. It just tells the damn story of a soldier's honor, which means doing the job no matter the odds--indeed, no matter the mission.",
        "The special power of Eastwood's achievement is that, save for one indelible moment, the mutual recognition between sworn adversaries happens not on-screen, but later, as we piece the two films together in our minds.",
        "The humanistic approach makes Eastwood's movie a war story for the ages.",
        "This is sentimentality of the best kind, a touching display of male bonding amid terror and aching loneliness worthy of Howard Hawks at his finest.",
        "Letters From Iwo Jima, much like any war movie, honors the courage of men who took part in a war not necessarily of their making. But by placing us on the opposite side of the battlefield, the movie forces us to approach it from a fresh perspective.",
        "It's hard to explain exactly why Clint Eastwood's Letters From Iwo Jima is so much better than its companion World War II film \"Flags Of Our Fathers,\" except to say that Flags tries too hard to emphasize the ironies of selling a war, while Letters deals with the ins and outs of the war itself.",
        "For my money, Flags (however clunky) cuts more deeply, but Letters is more difficult to shake off. Together, they leave you with the feeling that even a just and necessary war is an abomination.",
        "In the last half-hour, the story, like the Japanese, loses its way; lacking any clear-cut goals except survival, the film becomes repetitive. Letters From Iwo Jima is a necessary movie; too bad it's not a great movie.",
        "A sharper account of the Iwo Jima conflict than Flags, this balances its unflinching handling of the horrors of war with its touching portrayal of those who face them.",
        "Letters from Iwo Jima is a unique American-made war movie for at least two reasons: it depicts the battle from the perspective of the losers and it represents the United States as the \"enemy.\"",
        "Far superior to its companion piece, \"Flags of Our Fathers,\" released earlier this year, \"Letters\" is a grim and humane film that has to be counted among the director's better efforts.",
        "For all its emphasis on doomed honour and grim death, Letters from Iwo Jima is also sentimental.",
        "The project lacks the variety of sensuous pleasures that a great movie has to provide.",
        "Letters covers less emotional ground than its predecessor, because Eastwood and first-time writer Iris Yamashita (who shares a story credit with Paul Haggis) allow Japanese soldiers only three modes of behavior.",
        "Portraying the same 1945 confrontation from the vantage point of the Japanese was an inspired idea. Unfortunately, the movie it inspired is something of a letdown.",
        "Eastwood is so busy humanizing Japanese soldiers that he ends up rewriting history.",
        "Even with the great Ken Watanabe lending command and compassion to the role of General Kuribayashi, it's a formless slog across a treacherous field."

The haunting scene with Sam and Baron-Nishi is utterly heartbreaking; especially with the revelation of the letter. That scene alone deserves best picture, but the twist into Japanese culture will undoubtedly change many peoples' minds about the Pacific Theater. They faught for the same reasons we all do; for their country, leader, land, religion, people, children, wives, each other, and the protection of their culture. 'If you don't see at least two sides of a story, you may as well be blind' as I always say, and Letters from Iwo Jima delivers what I've been dreaming for in that regard.",

The film works perfectly alone, without having seen 'Flags of Our Fathers', but obviously you can see its parallels. The fact that these characters fill us more, and connect more with them, do we show more interest in them and their stories.

Yes, it sounds very occasionally, as the film seeks at all times not to fall into sentimentality, and shun all emotion, but it is telling us is terrible and emotional. But emotion is contained, that is breath, and as only the masters know show.\rEastwood (or Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu for Babel) should have won the Oscar for best director. Scorssese maybe gave us the best movie of the year for The Departed, but the way this work Clint work is far superior to that of Martin, seeing it well I think that's clear but we can not fix that.\rWell this is one of the most beautiful and amazing movies of the decade 2000, if you have not seen, you have to see it.\rNot to be missed.",

It's not conventionally nice and fun to watch as escapist entertainment (duhhhrrr - it's a war movie, guys), but its message is original and not at all biased to either side. It simply seeks to tell the war from another perspective. The emotional punch that Eastwood brings to all of his films is most carefully channeled here, as the characters are well-drawn and their various fates are believable.I guess Eastwood's and the screenwriter's best idea was to make the Japanese human. Not angels, not demons, just people. The Japanese and the Americans both still have skewed ideas about this war, and the movie avoids this cloud of romanticism and brings a breath of fresh air to those who like thoughtful movies, and prefer reality overt romanticism about war. There are very few movies like it. No I don't think it's exactly how it happened, but it takes the war movie genre and injects some well-needed humanity into the side that is most often demonized.",

One ofClint Eastwood's 2006 film \"Letter From Iwo Jima\" is a companion piece to his earlier film \"Flags Of Our Fathers\". It centers around the exact same events in \"Flags\", but the perspective is switched towards the Japanese army this time. One of the questions I had going into \"Letters\" was - is it better than \"Flags\". In short, yes. I found \"Letters From Iwo Jima\" to be an unbelievable piece of film that, I feel, every American should get a chance to watch. One of the greatest aspects of the film itself is the film's screenplay, which is written almost entirely in Japanese. When I initially found this movie to be almost entirely in a different language, I worried that this quality would impair my ability to sympathize with its characters. I was wrong. I found this film's characters perfectly written and easy to sympathize and care for. The acting also helps with character development in this film. Ken Watanabe plays General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, probably the greatest character in the film. Watanabe's portrayal of the General is so well-crafted that you just can't help but have an immense amount of compassion for him. In a visual sense, \"Letters\" utilizes the same sort of bleak and grainy style that was present in \"Flags\", and this (once again) really helps add to the underlying realistic and grim tone. Eastwood's expert directorial work also shines throughout this film. Overall, I found \"Letters From Iwo Jima\" to be an incredibly well-made and poignant war drama.",

Read any accurate history about this conflict and you'll discover that Japanese soldiers who actually did surrender were astounded by the compassion of the Americans. They had been taught to expect the worse. Yes that was the Japanese propaganda given to their soldiers. But our very own filmmakers feel compelled to propagandize the brutality of America. It's sadly ironic that a country that provides a director the freedom to combat propaganda chooses his medium to propagandize himself. This was and should have been a great film.

I like any good audience member come to a film as though IMy first reaction to this movie was I loved it.In fact I think it may go into my list of the 5 all time best movies ever made.That is if,its as the title infers, that it is truthful. I like any good audience member come to a film as though I were a jury member and were to look at something, as much as we can as though it were a blank slate.So as the title and opening scene suggests I am seeing a film based on letters from the Japanese home based on their real experiences fighting at Iwo, not a Hollywood writers construct. I am always looking for authenticity at least in the human experience. At that level I bought the film hook line and sinker.This goes to how extraordinarily well the film is acted directed and cut.(Spoiler) I balked at the American GIs killing the two POWS, and the moments when the General asks his fellow officer to lop off his head and at the last moment the young officer is shot and killed. The final scenes however come back and save the picture from Hollywoods almost constant insistence for going over the top.As a man born just after WWII and an American and a fellow who met and talked with our soldiers who went through and lived the Batan Death March horror , my view of the Japanese military borders on real hate and when you throw in the hell of Nanking, moves into loathing..I understand the ancient codes of the Samurai, much of which is too be admired and emulated.When that code looses all humanity or compassion and it turns into mass suicide it is totally corrupt.The general fights to win at all cost as though leading his men to certain death by delaying the end of the battle or conclusion of the war has any real chance when he knows it does not.The story I have heard of the last days of the battle for Iwo were a relentless artillery bombardment and then the ghastly business of US Marines having to go in with flame throwers cave by cave.While there were some Bonsai charges thats not the way the battle ended. To the larger issue ,is it a revisionist propaganda film? It is when you realize that all human beings for the most part are not devoid of human decency and we need to be reminded of that.The charge may have some validity when it shows Gis killing two POWS and Japanese lending comfort to an American GI. Japanese barbarity across all fronts without exception is notorious.On the other hand I think it can be said most Germans and Japanese were not clamoring for war or desirous of genocide or the barbarity which became the status quo. It was created by some very twisted and sick leaders.Its not like we US citizens are by birth immune from it.My God we are beginning to accept war under false pretense and torture as acceptable. This film challenged me to think about the Japanese side more compassionately. It moved me and it is incredibly good on many levels and I think its a good counter point to a lot of our sides propaganda.I am however still uncomfortable with the implied lie that it is based on documentary evidence .That will take some further research on my part.As an artistic and fictional film made to get over a point I think it has all the markings of a great film.As an actor I can say the acting work in all cases is stellar.From a film makers point of view the script is good in relation to pace and action but a little lacking in quality of dialogue,cinematography excellent,The incredible use of color which almost fades into black and white is Iwo Jima.The sound is great dialog is crisp and center,surround is effective and well balanced. The editing is compelling without any ham handed smash cutting.The acting and direction superb,the officer with the death of his horse,the reveal of the of the labeled zealot,the confession of the general who wants to live,the perfectness of the custom radio broadcast song, all delicate and deep with great power. Costumes effects and stunts real without hokey cliche,the bombing runs about as good as it gets.Overall maybe its the power of the Japanese culture or the theme maybe the superb work of all the craftsman , the best thing I can say about this film is, I felt honored to watch it. Whether it is a documentary or a artwork it moved me.That after all is the job of the great film maker.Congratulations Master Clint Eastwood.",

These are the historical facts in that we created the monster.  In 1894 we forcibly make Japan enter into an alliance to open their ports to the U.S. and Great Britain after a 200 year absense of visiting Japanese soil.  Humiliated they agree as they do not have the technology to match up with the West.  Japan then sends their best 150 young minds to the U.S. and Great Britain to learn modern technology.  Among these is a young Samarui name Lt. Toga.  He studies in Great Britain and adopts the ruthless agenda of Admiral Nelson in show no mercy to your enemies.  Japan then becomes an industrial power as we teach them our technology.  In 1905 Japan intends to invade China and Korea who are defenseless.  To do so they must defeat Russia.  Admiral Toga in 1905 springs a SNEAK ATTACK against the Russians in the Battle of Port Arthur without announcing WAR on Russia.  The American press lauds Japan and calls it a stroke of genius as Japan is our ally.  The Japanese are ruthless as they crush their enemy.  35 years later the U.S. doesn't find it so amusing when they SNEAK ATTACK Pearl Harbor where again they show no mercy.  But I guess Clint feels they discover God and change their stripes at Iwo Jima.  Nice story if you want to believe it???",

I saw the movie and as a work of art it is pretty good.  But the story it tells is more fiction than fact having a loved one who participated in the event.  But why should that stop a liberal Clint Eastwood from rewriting history?  Time heals all wounds and it is nearly 70 years since the event took place.  Most of our brave American men are now presumbably dead and have no way to respond to this attrocity portraying the Japaneese as the good guys fighting with honor.  What is so bothersome is that Japan has a history of Sneak Attacks long before Pearl Harbor.  In 1905 it is true that the sandbagged the Russians at Port Arthur and then planned to destroy their Navy again after the initial Sneak Attack which they were very successful in doing.  This led us into WW I.  HIstory repeated itself on Dec. 7, 1941 a day that used to live in Infamy, that is before Clint Eastwood decided to change things up?  If you don't learn from history we are bound to repeat it.  I have to laugh as we now commence wars (i.e. Iraq) by asking we are going to bomb you on Monday is that good for you?  Can you imagine the world's outcry if America ever Sneak Attacked anyone?  But I am only someone who is aware of the terrible things that the Japanese did to our boys at Iwo Jim;  but who am I to argue with Clint Eastwood how honorable the ENEMY was?  If you want to buy into this propaganda then by all means enjoy the movie.  As I said it was a good movie from an artistic point of view and on that there can be no mistake.

Although not expecting the intensity that is the first 15 minutes of \"Saving Private Ryan,\" I must admit to being more than a little taken aback at the lack of horror and pathos that that invasion engendered in the DVD I saw last weekend. Instead, the entire movie seemed to focus around Native American Marine Ira Hayes and his experience on and after Iwo as a flag raiser in that historic second photograph, which ultimately led to his alcoholism and untimely demise. While that flag raising was important, and its politcal ramifications are undeniable, entire movies have been structured around the premise of our invasions of foreign soil. Witness \"The Longest Day.\" Iwo Jima, Tarawa, Guam, Guadalcanal, etc. set the stages for some of the most vicious fighting of World War II, and news photography of those battles horrified our nation, yet they seem to have been relegated to being historical footnotes to the political ramifications of jingoistic symbolism of which some of these battles gave rise to. My uncle died far before his time for much more than that, I trust. If you really want to spare the easy political statement of \"Flags...\" in this time of true heroism, and make a stirring war movie in the process, Clint, how about a take on William Manchester's \"Goodbye Darkness?\"",

To those that say it is revisionist, I disagree. The film does an admirable job of showing the militaristic fascism of the japanese while also not demonizing them. There were only a few hundred japanese left alive out of 22,000. Franklly, I do not believe that THAT many of them were suicidal fanatics. Instead I do believe that many Americans killed prisoners out of fear, anger or whatever. It does not make America bad, only those soldiers. Those soldiers are the same in any war, which is Eastwood's entire point.

It is actually rather boring.  The dialogue is stiff.  The characters are caricatures and I found it difficult to feel emotionally for them, even though I knew that the idea of the film was too feel for these people. The Japanese cultural trait of suicide and killing your own brothers in arms is played up in the film in a way that you come away thinking how different of culture Japan must have had than us in WW II.  From the way it is presented, you wonder how the battle lasted any time at all since after about 5 minutes of battle in the film, the Japanese seem pretty intent on just killing themselves.  This leads me to believe that some re-writing of history must have gone on here.  The whole metaphor about letters seems added on rather than really organic to the film.  At some level of ideas, perhaps this films works, but, on an emotional level, it just doesn't work very well.",

Scott in the first two minutes of You-Know-What. \"He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for HIS country.\" And though Patton fought Germans, not Japanese, the principle, as Clint Eastwood powerfully illustrates in Letters From Iwo Jima, remains the same: the pivotal battle location became a bloodbath for the Japanese fighting forces because, in instructing the men that they would most likely NOT leave the island alive, their commanders were inadvertently setting them up to BE the poor dumb bastards. The second half of Eastwood's duo of pictures that don't so much commemorate Iwo Jima as put it under a microscope, Letters is far more effective than the previous Flags of Our Fathers because it's much less fussily pretentious (especially in its use of flashbacks) and tells a far more focused, disciplined story that doesn't go in endless different directions. Tom Stern's \"practically-black-and-white\" cinematography works more powerfully here, too, because it underlines Letters' depiction of the futility of this battle for the Japanese by pictorially depicting its location, which is defined early on as a vital strategic post, as inhospitable and unworldly, more like a meteorite than anyplace recognizable on earth. It's fascinating to watch Eastwood in the late stages of his directorial career seemingly doing everything possible to completely redefine its early and middle sections: the intensely pacifistic Western Unforgiven cancels out the larkily ultraviolent work he did for Sergio Leone and others by demonstrating just how valuable human life is and how painful its loss; the anti-mob justice drama Mystic River seriously questions the law-and-order ethics of his Dirty Harry series, and his Iwo Jima films negate the rowdy, Late-Late-Show hyperpatriotism of his Grenada opus Heartbreak Ridge. But before liberals start firing up the veggieburger grills to welcome Eastwood as one of their own, they should keep in mind that Clint (who as far as I know is still a Republican) is nothing if not impossible to pigeonhole, and Letters From Iwo Jima, for all its implicit commentary on the futility of war, also violates one of the primary tenets in the ultra-liberal handbook: while honoring and treasuring the lives of the individual Japanese fighting men and their likable commander General Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe), it's also quite unsparing in its criticism of a national culture and mindset that in many ways contributes to their doom. There are enough ritualistic suicides to rival any film made about the People's Temple in Jonestown, and the Japanese code of combat as depicted here shamefully and unnecessarily wastes human life by advocating dying \"honorably\" over trying to survive to fight another day. In a time and place such as our own, when making even obvious, justifiable generalizations about another nationality, religion or culture has become so verboten that even an airline's very sensible recent act of arresting a group of suspiciously-behaving Muslim passengers who seemed to be preparing to hijack a plane is placed under ridiculous scrutiny, Eastwood deserves commendation for doing the near impossible. In Letters From Iwo Jima he's managed to be politically correct AND incorrect at the same time!",

The first hour and a half or so is very slow, but it does help to build toward the fantastic anding. No, it is not saying that what Japanese leaders decided to do was okay. It has nothing to do with that. It simply tells a story that reveals that the Japanese soldiers were no different than the American soldiers. They had families waiting for them to come home. They wanted the war to end. They wanted to fight for their country and their honor. The meaning of this film is that every war is a civil war. We're all human. This film reminds me of a quote from Ernest Hemingway: \"Never think that war, no matter how necessary, nor how justified, is not a \rcrime.\" That is completely true, and the scene where an American murders two Japanese POWs is very upsetting. In the end, this is an amazing war film and if you are one of the reviewers who hated it because it didn't depict the Japanese soldiers as barbarians, you are just extremely ignorant. One person even said that it was offensive to all U.S. veterans because it showed that the Japanese soldiers were not savages.

It does portray Japanese soldiers as 3d human beings but is that such an accomplishment? It shows how they ran out of ammo, hadn't eaten and without water for 5 days, and so on. It also demonstrates how they mistreated each other because of their enormous macho honor and \"patriotism\" but to me it gets a little overdone and forced. The battles don't seem real to me either. Even so, I enjoyed the film and felt a lot of sympathy for the poor soldiers trapped in the middle. Very much like the real thing in that respect.",

Artistically, this film is beautiful. The high contrast, low saturation cinematography burns every image of the film into your mind, leaving you to think about it for days after viewing it. Seeing a war movie from the \"enemies\" point of view is such a fresh and brilliant idea... I can't believe it's not something that's done more often at this level. For those people that seem to be disgusted with the fact that Eastwood portrays these Japanese soldiers as \"nice guys\", I think you're failing to see the humanity injected into this film. Those average japanese soldiers were regular guys, just like the Americans that stormed the beach. At no time does Eastwood show Japanese soldiers sympathizing with the Americans, or vise versa. The message is crystal clear... they're just regular men caught up in a war not of their own making. They're not \"Evil Japs\", contrary to what propaganda would have you believe. A great message, and a lesson to be learned about the human condition.",
