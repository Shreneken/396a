    "critic_reviews": [
        "If there is any justice, this year's Academy Award for best foreign-language film will go to The Lives of Others, a movie about a world in which there is no justice.",
        "The easy, complacent distance that informs much historical filmmaking is almost entirely absent from this supremely intelligent, unfailingly honest movie.",
        "A thoroughly compelling political thriller, at once intellectually challenging and profoundly emotional.",
        "A tense and tightly plotted fictional thriller is based on real tactics used by the Stasi -- East Germany's secret police force -- to spy on and interrogate their own citizens.",
        "It's an intricate, ambiguous and deeply satisfying movie, a tautly plotted tale of state surveillance and personal betrayal that ultimately becomes an ode to the transformative power of art.",
        "Smartly crafted, impeccably acted, The Lives of Others packs a subtle punch, from its creepy first images to its poignant finale.",
        "A great film, the best I've seen since Terrence Malick's \"The New World,\" and far and away the richest and most brilliantly acted picture to be released this Oscar season.",
        "To watch \"Lives\" is not just to enjoy a fabulously constructed timepiece; it's to appreciate a deft cautionary tale.",
        "It's so full-blooded, smart, sexy, tense and absorbing, so cleverly written and shot and cut, so filled with superb acting and music, so perfect in its closing moment, that it surely ranks with the most impressive debuts in world cinema.",
        "Lives is a best-foreign-film nominee competing in a year that at least three movies in this category are stronger than Oscar's best-picture contenders.",
        "The unique, serious fun of this movie - and forbidding reputation aside, it is exhilarating - lies in the way that Wiesler, Dreyman and Sieland end up collaborating unknowingly on their own Design for Living (for a while, it's like Noel Coward for moral cowards).",
        "von Donnersmarck creates a milieu so realistic that the attention-worthy setting becomes just a backdrop, while an intricate tale, as suspenseful as it is humanistic, takes over.",
        "Already f\u00eated, von Donnersmarck\u2019s debut sets a closely focused, personal story against a more expansive backdrop of politics and power games -- a moving, enlightening tale of recent times.",
        "A powerful but quiet film, constructed of hidden thoughts and secret desires.",
        "Utterly riveting fictional drama.",
        "It convincingly demonstrates that when done right, moral and political quandaries can be the most intensely dramatic dilemmas of all.",
        "It's hard to believe this is von Donnersmarck's first feature. His storytelling gifts have the novelistic richness of a seasoned master. The accelerating plot twists are more than just clever surprises; they reverberate with deep and painful ironies, creating both suspense and an emotional impact all the more powerful because it creeps up so quietly.",
        "Ulrich M\u00fche gives a marvelously self-contained performance. There isn't an ounce of fat on his body, or in his acting: He has pared himself down to a pair of eyes that prowl the faces of his character's countrymen for signs of arrogance--i.e., of independent thinking.",
        "Despite the fact that parts of this film remind us of past pictures with comparable themes, the director and his actors make it immediate, gripping.",
        "Like all great screen performances, M\u00fche's magic comes out most in its tiniest moments: a raised eyebrow here, a slight upturn of the lips there. It's a triumph of muted grandeur; it's like watching someone being born.",
        "Von Donnersmarck has crafted the best kind of movie: one you can't get out of your head.",
        "With solid performances and a terrific screenplay, this movie offers solid, no-frills drama that feels organic and believable, not contrived.",
        "von Donnersmarck delivers something extraordinary and rare: a thriller that's entirely adult in both its concerns and perspective which manages to be as thoroughly gripping as any finely tuned albeit adolescent Hollywood nail-biter.",
        "Except for Hempf, every character is under incredible duress, and the performances are exceptional. With his first feature, an Oscar nominee for foreign-language film, von Donnersmarck has certainly left his mark.",
        "The skillfully acted and directed The Lives of Others is a timely warning about governments that seek to repress dissent.",
        "A movie that combines the Cold War intrigue of John Le Carr\u00e9 with the wired buzz of Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Conversation\" -- one of those rare two-hour-plus pictures that runs long but plays bracingly, excitingly short.",
        "Works beautifully, both as a social and psychological drama and as a taut, tightly wired thriller.",
        "The Lives of Others has similarities to Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 classic \"The Conversation\" but with undercurrents that resound across an entire century of European political history.",
        "Beautifully textured and layered movie.",
        "The director is fortunate to have cast actors who fully embody their roles. Muehe, who once played Josef Mengele in Costa-Gavras's \"Amen,\" has the ability to let you see far beneath his masklike countenance. Koch, dashing and intense, is entirely believable as a man of the theater; Gedeck exudes a sensuousness that this covert society cannot abide.",
        "M\u00fche's performance is brilliant, communicating more turmoil and pain with the droop of a lip and a flicker of the eye across an otherwise intently passive face than all the emotional storms of the cast.",
        "Starts out dark and challenging then comes to a startlingly satisfying and warmly human conclusion that lingers long after the curtain has come down.",
        "Superbly cast drama\u2026 that looks to be a solid upscale attraction wherever the special chemistry of good writing and performances is appreciated.",
        "This is a teasingly complex political thriller, but it's also a sort-of romance.",
        "von Donnersmarck gives his debut feature, The Lives Of Others, no particular style, and the absence of visual risk-taking renders an exciting premise ponderous and stolid.",
        "A compelling thriller but an unsatisfying character drama.",
        "The fictional story here, set between 1984 and 1991, focuses on the investigation of a popular and patriotic playwright (Sebastian Koch); that the captain assigned to his case (touchingly played by Ulrich M\u00fche) is mainly sympathetic and working surreptitiously on the playwright's behalf only makes this more disturbing.",
        "The Lives of Others wants us to see that the Stasi -- at least some of them -- were, like their Gestapo brethren, \u201cjust following orders.\" You can call that naive optimism on Donnersmarck's part, or historical revisionism of the sort duly lambasted by the current film version of Alan Bennett's \"The History Boys.\" I, for one, tremble at the thought of what this young director does for an encore."

The picture is no more nostalgic for the days of East German Communism than any equivalent film dealing with a Nazi functionary's gradual change of heart would be for the Third Reich. Since East German Communism finally fell without the firing of a shot, one can certainly infer that by the end of that regime, it must have been riddled with just the sort of disillusioned secret policemen Foundas finds so unbelievable here. Nor is it particularly the policeman's exposure to art that subverts his loyalties to the state; a deeper and fairer reading of his character might locate the reason for that change in his discontent with his own empty personal life, compared to the appealing human attachments of the people he's spying on.....Where do I apply to write film reviews for LA Weekly?",

In Germany, this film was criticized for being too hard on the Stasi secret police actually. I do not want to go on about the misguided comparison of the Stasi to the Gestapo. Anyway, the film is set in the 1980s when the socialist system was about to dissolve and the Stasi exercised less power over people, especially artists, than in the years before. The kind of GDR the film portrays is more like the stalinist communism of the 1950s. While in the years after it was still a totalitarian system, people took their freedoms and started to care less about the overpowering presence of the state. So, this film painting the Stasi as omnipresent and powerful got it wrong and the reviewer Foundas got the film all wrong, calling it revisionist. He should get his facts right before he starts reviewing European films. I wonder why Americans can be so terribly political (and p.c.!) when it comes to reviewing films that are about people, really. Even had it been a Gestapo officer, I would be interested in his feelings, private life etc. Would it be a revisionist film for trying to convey such a story?",

The main idea of the movie was the Stasi monitoring a man named Georg Dreyman. In some parts of the movie it can be a little sad or dark, but in the end, it has a very touching message. It shows, through a man named Weisler, that mankind can have good in them as well as bad. He helped Dreyman, an innocent man, escape the punishment of the Stasi. Even though he wound up risking and ruining his career, Weisler still saved Dreyman multiple times without even Dreyman knowing it. That is something that can be hard to grasp because most people are unwilling to help someone to that extent when they themselve lose more than they gain. It actually goes against our normal instinct as human being. As well as being an uplifting an somewhat emotional movie, there are many, many, many deeper psychological aspecs to it.

It's 1984 in East Berlin and Capt. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) is a secret agent of the Stasi, who investigate people who are suspected of undermining government authority. But his newest subject has an unanticipated effect on the Captain. He sits in an attic day after day, night after night, spying on the people in the flat below.\rThe flat is occupied by a playwright named Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his mistress, the actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Wiesle first saw Dreyman at the opening of one of his plays, where he was informed by a colleague that Dreyman was a successful man.  Dreyman is good-looking, successful, with a beautiful lover; he must be getting away with something. Driven by suspicion, or perhaps by envy, Wiesler has Dreyman's flat wired and begins an official eavesdropping inquiry. Though von Donnersmarck accords Dreyman and Crista a fair amount of screen time, their roles are to act as catalysts. This is Wiesler's story and, although there are moments of tragedy, it's ultimately one of redemption. Wiesler is a fascinating character in that he is a blank slate if you will, trained by his life to reflect no emotion. Sometimes not even his eyes move. As played in Muehe's performance of infinite subtlety, he watches Dreyman as a cat awaits a mouse. And he begins to internalize their lives, because he has no life of his own; no lover, no hobbies, no distraction from his single-minded job. Wiesler has no one he can really talk to. His gradual transition from loyal soldier to actual human being is what's most compelling throughout. The seduction depicted in \"The Lives of Others\" is inadvertent. Wiesler is enticed by the possibility of art, meaning, and love, all of which are absent from his existence, but present in that of Dreyman and Crista. Wiesler lives in a bare apartment, with nothing to distinguish it from a hotel room and, when he desires company, he calls a prostitute. By listening to Dreyman and Crista, he discovers the potential of a more fulfilling existence. Eventually, his desire to be part of something meaningful leads him to act to protect the couple, even though his actions violate the law and place his career in jeopardy. Gripping and arresting drama from first time director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is masterfully executed. Ulrich Muhe gives a phenomenal performance, a film that will stand the test of time. Oscar winner as Best Foreign Language Film.",

A little 'on-the-nose' there at the end, but really, this is just a solid solid film. Before I had seen this, I was a bit in disbelief anything could've beaten Pan's Labyrinth for best FL film at the Oscars--but now I see why (still think Pan is better though). And Ulrich Muhe's character (HGW) is one of the best performances/stories I've seen on film in some time. Definitely worth the DVD rental.",

If that turns you off, you may not be aware enough to enjoy it. It requires a certain understanding of the balls it took to make this film and what it says about Fascism and putting too much power in the hands of a few unchecked individuals. While I certainly enjoy the \"Armageddon\" or \"Independence Day\" this movie has stuck with me for more that two months. I found a few minor flaws, none worth mentioning. When you're in the mood to slow down and pay attention to something that matters, this is it.",

The suspense and thrills of the spy genre are also here and in full force. This one manages to keep you on the edge of your seat without multiple action sequences and shootouts. It is a film built on tension and shows you how to create it without those scenes. As such, the direction from Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is great, as is the script from him. Both his direction and the writing are top-notch. As with all foreign films, the fact that is in another language can be a barrier of entry for some, but for me, this one felt like it was in English. I barely even noticed they were speaking German I was so engrossed in the story. In addition, the ending is fantastic and really brings everything to a wrap nicely. As a whole, this one is deserving of the praise it has received and stands as one of the best spy films of the past 10 years.",

It's wonderful how the film is surrounded by the analogy between the hidden desires and the secret police that controlled everything in the communist bloc. Did the captain want to hide his feelings under those excruciating interrogatories when he was capable of annihilate on the mental health of the suspect, or he became like that in a slow process of finding the true virtues of humanity? I think this is the main question the director asks himself, should we create our new beginning?",

FromClass!\rThese fine actors give a subtle, understated yet brilliant performance in this historical thriller. A simple setting combined with a palatable yet complex plot, which elegantly glides through the duration of the movie. From interrogations to surveillance as well as delicately crafted dialogue between authority and rebellion, the agonizing intersection between state control and humanity is wonderfully illustrated through language, costume and characterization.\rWhile I would question some of the political references which seem a little clich\u00e9d, as well as the somewhat swift catharsis of the main character-this film deserves a viewing from any history or German culture buff. In the same bracket as 'Hidden', 'Valkyrie' and the Bourne series. 9/10",

Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck; the writer-director, has written a complicated character driven feature that is smart front the first frame until the curtain drops and only if it had better editing on its side, it would have easily entered the major league. Ulrich Muhe has done a splendid job since he didn't have much verbal content in it, he still expresses it beautifully and is supported decently by Martina Gedeck and Sebastian Koch. Das Leben Der Anderen is a thought provoking feature that screeches onto one's heart for it goes into dark places that you may be familiar with but still never experienced like this before.",
