    "critic_reviews": [
        "Basic Instinct 2 isn't bad, exactly, but it lacks the entertaining vulgarity of the first film; it's Basic Instinct redone with more ''class'' and less thrust.",
        "BI2 is packed with as much lust, nudity and sexual depravity as the first. So, why isn't it as much fun? What's lost in any sequel is the freshness of the first film, and was \"BI1\" ever fresh!",
        "Those hoping for either a sizzling -- or an unintentionally hilarious -- good time will be disappointed by this inexplicably dull sequel.",
        "The movie isn't boring, exactly. It's too nutty for that.",
        "Like many sequels this is actually a remake, and it suffers from the law of diminishing returns.",
        "It's turned Stone's Catherine Tramell from a warning sign for the dangers of wanton sex into the last thing you'd figure - a bore.",
        "A few bodies pile up. Surprisingly little sex is had. And given that Catherine's true nature was revealed at the end of the first \"Basic,\" the mystery seems superfluous.",
        "Basic Instinct 2 pushes diligently along in a murder-and-mayhem-stuffed effort to demonstrate that (a) a sillier and more hackneyed movie than \"Basic Instinct\" is possible and (b) that shrinks have ids too, by golly.",
        "Morrissey gives a stiff, awkward performance, while Stone moves dangerously close to overplaying the femme fatale. There is little if any intrigue in the story or the characters. Even the murders don't even seem to matter much.",
        "If you're trying to reinvigorate the art of the stylish thriller, the movie you come up with needs to be stylish and it needs to be thrilling. Basic Instinct 2,  is neither.",
        "Fails as a sequel because we\u2019re not in the 90s anymore. Gone are the days when characters could answer questions with questions and hypothetical situations and still sound clever and cool.",
        "Once the credits are done rolling it's a dour, enervated mystery, selling the old cat-and-mouse games.",
        "Basic Instinct 2 is supposed to help Stone show it's possible for a woman to be sexy in her late 40s. But it's Rampling - who is 60 - who comes off as the more provocative and alluring. Stone's purring, snarling, bedroom kink is embarrassing.",
        "It's a lot of things, but boring is not one of them. I cannot recommend the movie, but ... why the hell can't I? Just because it's godawful? What kind of reason is that for staying away from a movie? Godawful and boring, that would be a reason.",
        "For all the sex and slicing, the most shocking thing about it is how dreary it is.",
        "Basic Instinct 2 is double trouble -- the femme is to die for, the film is to die from.",
        "Where is the suspense part? There is no suspense part. Suspense demands clarity of motive and action, and this screenplay never provides it.",
        "What we may very well be looking at here is another \"Showgirls,\" a drag camp-fest for the \"Baby Jane\" crowd, fabulous fodder for future cabaret acts, and a pleasure probably best enjoyed in a crowd -- preferably a vocal one. Dead serious and stone idiotic, the only basic instinct in evidence here is desperation.",
        "Not content simply to examine the relationship between sex and death, BI2 ponderously blurs the boundaries between art and life, and the plot, already mired in nonsensical backstory, collapses with the late-inning introduction of a tired metafictional device (not to mention a wildly lunging \"Usual Suspects\" twist).",
        "Fortunately, as a showcase for Sharon Stone's physique, Basic Instinct 2 is a rousing success. In every other respect, it's a colossal failure.",
        "In a better movie, this grand-dame performance might have been fun, but it's surrounded here by an impossibly dull and unsatisfying whodunit plot, unintentionally funny dialogue and such absurdities as having Catherine stay up late one night and whip out an entire novel.",
        "This film is unable to involve, entertain, or titillate. Basically, it stinks.",
        "The 1992 phenomenon was creepy, tense and sexually charged in a bold yet tawdry way. This sequel lacks even a shred of those elements.",
        "Few expected Basic Instinct 2 to be very good, but no one expected it to be this boring.",
        "The sequel is one big tease.",
        "The accidental comedy sensation of the year to date.",
        "Stupefyingly lackluster.",
        "This script by the husband-and-wife team of Leora Barish and Henry Bean is hopelessly contrived and takes forever to get to the point. (I warn you: The film does not absolutely identify the killer.)",
        "At this point, there are inflatable toys that are livelier than Stone, but how can you tell the difference? Basic Instinct 2 is not an erotic thriller. It's taxidermy.",
        "A disaster of the highest or perhaps lowest order.",
        "Stone still dazzles the eye, but this wholly unwarranted sequel is so outrageously preposterous (and so very chockablock with quotable examples of the fine art of bad dialogue) that the end result achieves a basement grandeur of near-epic proportions.",
        "The laughs to be had in this deliciously awful sequel are all unintentional. A bummer for film buffs, but a ball for fans of the misbegotten."

            "content": "Nowhere near as good as the original which was an excellent film..... Basic Instinct 2, apparently came out in 2006 but I can't remember to be honest. It's a thriller/mystery/erotic by very little kind of a movie and the sequel to the 1992Nowhere near as good as the original which was an excellent film..... Basic Instinct 2, apparently came out in 2006 but I can't remember to be honest. It's a thriller/mystery/erotic by very little kind of a movie and the sequel to the 1992 original Basic Instinct with Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone. Strangely enough Michael Caton-Jones made the sequel instead of Paul Verhoeven and Michael Caton-Jones I think also directed The Jackal with Bruce Willis and Richard Gere...... Anyway, Basic Instinct 2 opens with Sharon Stone speeding around in her car at night with what seems to be a drugged up Stan Collymore in the passenger seat. I don't know 100% if he was drugged or drunk but he didn't look very well so something was wrong with him. Anyway they are doing naughty things in the car and Sharon Stone drives her car into the water, leaves Collymore to die and saves herself. In the next scene we see Sharon Stone I think being questioned and she eventually ends up seeing some psychiatrist or specialist or something named Michael Glass (David Morrissey). In parts of the conversation throughout the film Sharon Stone who plays Catherine Tramell mentions sex in one form or another to Michael Glass. The conversations at times are a bit awkward and David Morrissey as Michael Glass is annoying, dull and quite basically a terrible character who wasn't really needed. The storyline isn't as good as the original and the sex scenes are not as good as the original and the film feels more gloomier and the colour used in the film feels darker and limited whereas the original felt more brighter and colourful. There's a few death scenes but none are impressive and Sharon Stone is awful as Catherine Tramell but in the original she was young, hot, sexy, attractive, tough, clever but in Basic Instinct 2 she looks like she's a 50+ year old trying to act young and look hot but fails. She still looks beautiful in Basic Instinct 2 but not a scratch on her role in the original and David Morrissey was terrible in Basic Instinct 2 and can't act to save his own life and Michael Douglas is a much better actor. Sharon Stone was much better in the original and in Basic Instinct 2 all these horrible characters who are unlikeable keep cropping up throughout the movie such as the dude who keeps questioning David Morrissey, some detective dude who gets killed by Morrissey later in the movie. The nudity and sex scenes are unimpressive, the directing could of been better, horrible use of colour in the movie with dull colours over and over, Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) looks terrible and is annoying at times and so is Michael Glass (David Morrissey) , the death scenes suck and the movies polluted with band characters who nobody cares about throughout the film and some of the dialogue is cheesey, annoying, rubbish, stupid and and silly... Sharon Stone smokes a cigarette in nearly every scene which is not a good role model to other women... Sharon Stone as Catherine Tramell in Basic Instinct 2 and David Morrissey aren't that impressive and Basic Instinct 2 sinks like Tramell's car at the beginning of the movie because it's an awful film and not the worst film but bad enough. If you liked the original 1992 Basic Instinct my advice is don't ever watch Basic Instinct 2 because it's not that good and rather disappointing!",

After all the entire movie is fascinatingly ridiculous. Sharon Stone's character from the first film has turned into a tour de force caricature. Yes she is too old to play the role but as written I can't think of any other actress who could play it either.\r The idea that any of the characters would find her so appealing that they would jettison any shred of common sense out of the window is nuts. It's not so much the physical as mental. Her character screams look at me I am psychotic. Now certainly some of us have been guilty of being seduced by a patently psychotic middle aged nymphomaniac, but alcohol and late hours not to mention a dimly lit bar are usually involved. To be seduced by such a creature in the sober light of day is pure science fiction.\r Indeed every character in the movie seems inexplicably smitten in one way or the other by Stone. I can buy one disturbed and naive character such as the baby faced psychiatrist going nuts over her but his ex-wife and her lover as well? The movie has other faults as well. There really isn't all that much sex and it does drag at times. And while beautifully shot the lack of cohesive story and supposed twists are more yawn inducing than shocking.\r Certainly the film is worth a look just for Stone's over the top performance but don't be surprised if you check your watch while shaking your head in disbelief.",
