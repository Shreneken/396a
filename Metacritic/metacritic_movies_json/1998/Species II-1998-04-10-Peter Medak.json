  "critic_reviews": [
    "Most of this is silly, dim-witted stuff, but a few of the shocks carry some of the crude power of Jack Arnold's low-budget horror films of the 50s.",
    "The only thing that distinguishes Species 2 is how awful it is.",
    "\"Species\" at least had the benefit of Henstridge's glazed porn-doll perversity, but this time any glimmers of sexual ominousness are buried in a lame, desultory chase plot and in the woefully underimagined special effects.",
    "Though it never really taps into the whole JFK-as-alien-sex-fiend plot as a source of satire, Species 2 is still the superior piece of trash its predecessor should have been.",
    "Though there's some trashy fun to be had in the film's first half, this cynical sequel -- devolves into space junk even faster than the unfortunate Ross.",
    "What ensues is a Halloween-style blood bath accompanied by graphic sex scenes.",
    "A feeble excuse for a movie.",
    "Shoddily plotted and unimaginative, Species II is a slapdash effort at best, creepily unaffecting and minus the T&A this sort of film so desperately hinges on.",
    "Though Species II is far from serious and aimed squarely at the hairy-palmed, it really didn't need to be quite this rotten.",
    "The best advice to give anyone who wants to see Species II--other than \"don't go!\"--is \"don't eat!\"",
    "In the spring a monster's fancy lethally turns to thoughts of lust. This thought, reduced to a level contemptuous of taste and reasonable intelligence, underlies Species II.",
    "An unsavory and unsatisfying blend of dumb plotting, leering lasciviousness and full-bore gore, pic should warp-speed to video shelves.",
    "Brain-melting, head-spinning rank toxicity that shows no evidence of intelligence as we know it."

A few years later in 1998 we had SPECIES II which is a sci-fi horror sequel and I've seen this movie. Michael Madsen, Marg Helgenberger and Natasha Henstridge from the original made in 95 return for this sequel. Some astronaut gets infected with alien DNA after some mission to Mars then starts mating a dozen women when he gets back to earth and 4 minutes later the women give birth with their stomach's popping open and blood all over the place and alien babies sticking their head out of the dead women's stomach's.. Justin Lazard is the man infected with the alien DNA and he's the main character unlike the original it was Natasha Henstridge as the alien seductress and she returns in Species II as some half human/half alien named Eve with Justin Lazard as the alien main character not her.... Like the original Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger hunt it down but Species II even with all the gore, blood, excessive violence, action, sex scenes and Natasha Henstridge fully naked still felt dull and uninteresting and basically ugly compared to the original. Species made in 1995 was gorey, bloody, had action and violence and nudity and sex scenes but it felt interesting to a degree and entertaining and beautifuly directed and had a fairly decent story. Species II was just an ugly mess and even a few naked pornstars couldn't save it let alone a fully naked Natasha Henstridge because Species II even with all the violence and sex and nudity was still crap and even the sex scenes were rubbish which is laughable. Species II just feels horrible, depressing and an ugly mess compared to the original and a step down in quality. Justin Lazard can't act to save his life and Species II is one of the worst sci-fi movies ever made and certainly one of the worst sequels in film history. Horrible and crap film.",

Natasha Henstridge pregnant at the time of filming is back as Sil who is his number one target. The special FX are awesome and the creature design is inspired. Unlike the superior original it doesn't take itself seriously which is a good thing because the screenplay is not as well written. That being said the movie flows well moving from one gory setpiece to the next and it's never boring.7/10",
