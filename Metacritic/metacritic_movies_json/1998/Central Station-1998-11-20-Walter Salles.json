TheA young boy's (Oliveira) mother is killed in front of Rio de Janeiro's Central Station. Homeless and with nowhere to turn, he is reluctantly befriended by a lonely and cynical woman (Montenegro). Resisting her initial impulse to make a quick profit off the child, she commits to returning him to his father in Brazil's remote Northeast.  The trip becomes a quest for their own identities: one boy's search for his father, and one woman's search for her heart. (Sony Pictures Classics)â€¦ Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Easily among the top 10 films made last year.",
    "Fernanda Montenegro gives a landmark performance.",
    "A richly tender and moving experience.",
    "Profoundly affecting.",
    "But in a calculated move that pays off handsomely, the picture's remarkable power is reserved for the end, when the intertwining themes coalesce in an extraordinarily satisfying and stirring way.",
    "[Salles]'s imagery, like his storytelling, is clear, often unaffectedly lovely, and quietly, powerfully haunting.",
    "For Fernanda Montenegro, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Italy's late Giulietta Masina (Federico Fellini's wife and frequent star) in appearance and talent, \"Central Station\" is a personal triumph and a rich cinematic experience.",
    "Salles' solid narrative is only deceptively simple; there is a lot of dimension and depth to this gentle, sometimes painful portrait of two wanderers.",
    "Montenegro carries the film su-perbly with her portrait of gritty strength being worn down to a state of tattered vulnerability, while newcomer de Oliveira, a shoeshine boy who won the role over 1,500 other aspirants, is engagingly natural and happily doesn't beg for viewer sympathy.",
    "There's plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles' film is all in the telling.",
    "While the cinematography is gorgeous and the script extremely sharp, Central Station owes much of its strength to its two mismatched leads.",
    "Filled with moments of real poignancy and gentle epiphanies, the film is also marked by strong Christian undercurrents, but, like everything else in Salles's film, they're handled with extraordinary delicacy and never feel exclusionary.",
    "A touching and unusual road movie-cum-buddy film.",
    "The story is much less about its resolution than the experience along the way. At its best, Central Station is a movie of small textures and fleeting moments, the intangibles that pass between people.",
    "The movie's success rests largely on the shoulders of Fernanda Montenegro, an actress who successfully defeats any temptation to allow sentimentality to wreck her relationship with the child.",
    "A touching, well-made motion picture whose only real flaw lies in the overfamiliar storyline.",
    "The performances are engaging and the views of rural Brazil are captivating, making the film a solid audience-pleaser even though its story often seems familiar and sentimental.",
    "In this otherwise rather schematic swatch of social catharsis, Brazil's Fernanda Montenegro gives the best performance by an actress I've seen all year.",
    "I wasn't in the mood for this film, but it got to me anyway.",
    "A mildly saccharine but kind-hearted movie.",
    "This 1998 film held my interest for two hours, even taking on an epic feel when it turns into a road movie. It's not bad by any means, but it also happens to resemble a lot of other movies."
