  "summary": "The characters from the cult 1960s television show make it to the big screen.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "A smorgasbord of bad ideas, sumptuously over-realized.",
    "This is an elaborate production, but all the jazzy sets and explosions in the world can't disguise the story's complete lack of urgency.",
    "What's missing is chemistry: the right blend of seriousness and whimsy, and charmingly compelling interplay between leads Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman.",
    "The Avengers is too enervated to qualify as even a full-scale disaster.",
    "This new film version, sad to say, is a hollow shell of the original series.",
    "This big-budget bore looks lovely but is so miscalculated that you can't help but wonder whether anyone involved had ever seen the original.",
    "This film is an absolute mess.",
    "The movie is a dismal and misguided special-effects romp featuring two of the deadest performances recorded this year so far.",
    "So how then do you duplicate a magic aura from 30 years ago? You don't.",
    "The grasping novelty of the visuals doesn't rival the uncharismatic leads or the hopelessly, unironically banal plot.",
    "There's nothing but a convoluted overcast of story with a monsoon of bad dialogue.",
    "It's shockingly inert.",
    "The film flails incoherently from set to set, trying to be kicky and madcap and pop, but with no sense of the show's casual acceptance of the absurd.",
    "It's a film to gall fans of the old television series and perplex anyone else.",
    "In this movie, the sense of charm has been obliterated.",
    "There's something reassuring about the fact that The Avengers is so rotten: proof yet again that people with piles of money can hire wizard production designers but can't fake class.",
    "It's almost fascinating to witness just how lousy The Avengers really is.",
    "It's a completely botched effort -- botched in its direction, its writing and editing.",
    "The incomprehensible leads to the inexplicable which ends in the indecipherable."

I think its time Hollywood started to leave these types of things well alone.",

It is based on the superb and entertaining British TV series from the 1961-1969 with a revival from 1976-77. Adaptation wise this is in the top position for the worst adaptations of source material and comparable with The last Airbender. Both are slightly more than an in name only adaptation and the hearth, soul and humour from the original is gone. Also it is usually high ranked in worst of all time movie lists. It is simply poorly written, the story is unimpressive, the characters fail to entertain or are hilarious out of place. I want to mention that fans and non fans of the original are on a common ground here. They fail to grasp the concept of the series and entertaining movies. The show and characters deserved a better adaptation. John Steed is up there in style, intelligence and capability with the best agents in fiction (has also great humour). Emma Peel was an icon. A strong, capable and independent women (not seen often at the time). It was nominated for nearly all worst awards and won two (unfair for me because it earned more;-). I will stop bashing here and will say you should watch the TV series instead. The seasons with John Steed and Emma Peel are regarded as best. Remark: The tone from the first season is different. Also John Steeds companions change from time to time. There are (later) some fantasy or science fiction elements in some episodes and other take a more grounded approach. The mixture of action, good stories, humour and characters made this show great.",
