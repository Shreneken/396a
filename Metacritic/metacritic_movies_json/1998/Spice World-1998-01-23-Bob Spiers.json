  "summary": "The big screen debut (and finale) of the Spice Girls.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "A joyous, hilarious send-up of rock star pretensions and an enchanting celebration of \"girl power\" in pop culture.",
    "Without much of a plot to speak of and relying almost entirely on the girls' star power and charisma - which they have in spades - turns out to be a truly entertaining movie for anyone with even a bare knowledge of the Spice Girls' history, which in this age of absolute over-saturation, is hard to avoid.",
    "Disarmingly, the film thus acknowledges the Spice Girls' flash-in-the-pan status and lets them kid around about their frankly synthetic career.",
    "The movie essentially mirrors the non-diva, down-to-earth personalities on which their act is based, and which include a sizable amount of self-parody.",
    "Critic-proof, devoid of plot or acting, and quick to mock anyone who might make something of it.",
    "Although the film is clearly trying to follow in the footsteps of the Beatles' classic, it's several long strides behind, lacking the same sense of originality, spontaneity, high energy, and joi de vivre.",
    "Shabbily filmed, thoroughly harmless Official Product.",
    "There are several non sequitur subplots woven together -- and that, along with a dearth of acting talent, is Spice World's biggest flaw.",
    "It's all pure, brainless fluff, but it's unpretentious and \"Wannabe\" is damnably catchy.",
    "Bad as it may be, though, the film falls that one precious inch shy of being quite so awful that it achieves cult status; in short, it's just not bad enough to be any good.",
    "A promotional tool that establishes its superfluousness simply by existing, this clumsy, smirking movie has a bitter soul.",
    "They're so detached they can't even successfully lip-synch their own songs.",
    "Rarely has one movie seemed so predestined to reduce any and all attempted criticism to so many column inches of impotent gibberish.",
    "The director is Bob Spiers, though it's hard to judge whether he actually turned up on the set.",
    "The Spice Girls' mistake masquerading as a movie, is so bad that it makes the Village People's \"Can't Stop the Music\" look like \"Citizen Kane.\"",
    "About as awful and shamelessly pandering as a fanzine movie could dare to be."

That being said it can also be a bit of fun for the right audience. The movie is a spoof of itself taking the Spinal Tap approach. It's nonsensical and works more as an advertisement for the soundtrack which is kind of successful. There are spies, aliens, insidious gossip columned and more ad the girls play vigoursly into there set stereotypes trying to make us believe they have been friends since they were kids. Most of it doesn't work but there are some funny and clever bits and the movie is surprisingly feminist and not as annoying as it should be. You'll know if your it's audience as soon as it begins. All in all it's an extremely guilty pleasure that I mostly enjoyed.Budget: $25mDomestic Box Office: $29mWorldwide Box Office: $151m3/5",

I'm at the nostalgia level, I'd say.I remember watching 'Spice World' when I was very young and liking it, not sure to what degree but I certainly remember it. I undoubtedly enjoyed their music growing up, entirely truthfully... they did some bangers, don't @ me.As for the film, which I probably haven't seen in 15+ years, I'll put it this way: Spice Girls as musicians: yes! Spice Girls as actresses: not quite. It's extremely cheesy and the acting is very subpar, but the likeability of Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton & Co. at least keeps it watchable; to me, anyway.Richard E. Grant commits to his role, while they also got James Bond himself, Roger Moore, involved. There are also a number of cameos. Their music is entwined well, I wouldn't class myself as a fan but I rate a fair amount of their songs.I can understand if you dislike this, I truly can, but I found it alright to be honest. I definitely wouldn't say it's anything good, or all that close, though. Fans of the group will love it, I presume.",
