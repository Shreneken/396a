    "critic_reviews": [
        "With its dry, throwaway humor and constant stream of chuckles, it creates its own category of stealth comedy.",
        "A work of loopy, original comic genius.",
        "Murray, meanwhile, turns in a thrillingly knowing, unforced performance--an award-worthy high point in a career that continues, Max Fischer style, to defy the obvious at every turn.",
        "There\u2019s a lot of depth to Rushmore, but lingering in those depths for too long does a disservice to how consistently funny it also is.",
        "One of the freshest, richest, most original films to come out of Hollywood in a very long time.",
        "Anderson fulfills the promise of his inventive \"Bottle Rocket\" with this quirky, often hilarious comedy, and Murray gives his most uproarious performance since the groundbreaking \"Groundhog Day.\"",
        "Stylistically fresh and full of sweetness that never cloys, this is contemporary Hollywood filmmaking at its near best.",
        "The scene-stealer here is Bill Murray, who, after 25 years of near-hits, finds his most fully realized character yet.",
        "Weird, warm, monumentally entertaining comedy.",
        "It's the funniest, saddest performance of the year in a film of uncompromising wit and heart.",
        "It's too smart to be maudlin.",
        "Wickedly funny.",
        "I can't remember a teenage romance this engagingly offbeat since \"Lord Love a Duck.\"",
        "A marvelous comedy from deep in left field -- immaculately written, unexpectedly touching and pure of heart.",
        "Rushmore is an almost indefinable genre of its own. A comedy with a menacing edge? An ironic romance? Hard to call.",
        "Fast, exhilarating new comedy.",
        "Filled with brilliant, stand-out performances.",
        "A weird, wonderful and funny work that stands as a true original. As if that weren't enough, director and co-writer Anderson has given Bill Murray his best role in years.",
        "A true original: a film that stands apart from the crowd, goes its own way and all but dares you not to like it.",
        "One of the most original, good-hearted comedies in a long time, Rushmore is the sort of movie where the strangest sequences of discords somehow keep managing to reach giddily improbable resolutions.",
        "An often deft, frequently droll little movie.",
        "A beautifully off-center movie.",
        "One of the great things about this unpredictable, exhilaratingly goofy fable is how it shows that even the clueless - and the tragically morose - have a shot at redemption.",
        "This film is the product of artists working at the peak of their powers.",
        "Seems torn between conflicting possibilities: It's structured like a comedy, but there are undertones of darker themes, and I almost wish they'd allowed the plot to lead them into those shadows.",
        "Rushmore is one of those films that's so inconsequential that its memory threatens to fade away before the end credits have finished rolling.",
        "By the end, were it not for Murray, watching Rushmore would be like reading an article on \"Why adolescents need Prozac.\"",
        "You can't have Rushmore without Max, and though Anderson obviously planned it this way, the kid is finally too off-putting to tolerate."

It's definitely Jason Schwartzman's film, and Max Fischer is one of the most annoying egotistical brats ever committed to celluloid, but somehow he still remains a compelling protagonist thanks to Schwartzman's innate charm and undeniable skill as a character actor. Bill Murray and Olivia Williams are also great, with Murray giving one of his best performances in a role that is both comic and quite tragic, and Williams giving the film its real heart and humanity. The script, by director Wes Anderson and his permanent collaborator and longtime friend Owen Wilson, is brilliantly energetic, sharp and gag-laden, as well as being rather tender in places, and is far more successful than their screenplay for their debut film, Bottle Rocket. Occasionally the extreme kookiness of the characters and plot (often one of the film's greatest strengths) causes the film to lose a bit of focus and pace, but this rarely detracts from the fun of the whole experience - Rushmore is a really great film, with a top-notch cast, great writing, humour and poignancy aplenty.",

Rushmore stands out as one of the greats of the decade. Memorable, funny, charming, sad, and with a great soundtrack, Rushmore really solidified Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson as great creative forces. And it kickstarted the career of Jason Schwartzman and revitalized the career of Bill Murray.One of my biggest regrets in life is that I did not see Rushmore until I was done with college. I definitely relate to Max, and I shared a lot of his traits when I was in high school and college: I struggled with grades, loved extra curriculars, struggled in love, loved theatre, had friends, was madly in love with women who never loved me back, and did things that hurt those people in an attempt to make them love me. If I had seen Rushmore earlier in my life, things definitely would have played out differently. Max Fischer is a great example of what NOT to do in your life, and he's incredibly relatable for me in that regard. The only person you'll hurt is yourself.A great, fantastic coming of age story. Definitely check this one out!",

I can enjoy his overly stylized movies a great deal, but Rushmore never feels artificial or pretentious like those ones do.  It's a little quirky but it's nowhere near the extreme end of the spectrum.  It might also be Anderson's funniest movie.  Why?  It has the type of humor that pretty much anyone can get.  You don't need to be a jaded cinephile to get a few laughs out of it.  Murray & Schwartzman also make nearly perfect frienemies.  I always feel like Murray's usually wasted by Anderson, but here he's let out of his cage.  It's not perfect.  It could have had a few more funny scenes, and occasionally its tones don't meld entirely successfully.  But this is a real comedy, and I can't think of another Anderson movie that feels so much like it takes place in real life rather than some twee fantasy land.  Max Fisher might also be his funniest character.  In his own mind he's a total bad a#s.  In reality he's a dweeb, but you can't deny that he's a dweeb with guts and one vicious attitude.",

Did I add how felt about Bill Murray's part in the movie? Well, it wouldn't come as a surprise to say that he is hilarious in Anderson-ic speech and awkwardness of character. His pained but undefeated grimace in the scene where he is beset upon by bees and then retaliates 'appropriately' is purely comedy gold (Check out the revenge montage of Rushmore even if you don't watch the movie. It might just convince to do otherwise).Olivia Williams was a revelation for me in this movie because I had never seen before this one. And her character as stuck but beautiful damsel-in-distress woman who needs to be wooed by two friends who are separated by an age gap of 35 years or so is just... well, you get it, don't you?This is not my favourite Wes Anderson work, in fact it would least favourite of the six movies of his that I avidly love but that is only because unspoken uncertainty in the movie that i couldn't over or there too many bits I loved in it than the whole it presented.

The unresolved issues of the protagonist is what fuels this plot driven feature where its newer structure and unpredictable revelation is what keeps the audience engaged throughout the course of it where they are barely allow to breathe. It is short on technical aspects like sound department and background score but has got it right on its d.o.p. and editing. Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson keeps the amusing aspect of the characters alive throughout the course of it and addition to that Anderson's keen knowledge on executing an eerie world, favors in on huge margin. Jason Schwartzman is flat out hilarious on his role as a protagonist and is supported thoroughly by Bill Murray and Olivia Williams. The gripping screenplay and the space allotted to each character to fit in and flaunt their effective act, is what makes it dig deeper than its potential. Rushmore is a fast paced train that never derails from its tone but is also a long overcooked journey that can be off putting for some viewers.",
