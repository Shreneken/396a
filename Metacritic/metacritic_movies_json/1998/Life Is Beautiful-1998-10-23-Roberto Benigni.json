  "summary": "From one of the world's most acclaimed comic filmmakers comes an unexpected and unforgettable fable about the power of laughter to move the human heart and the power of the imagination to bolster the human spirit.  (Miramax Films)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "A deeply moving blend of cold terror and rapturous hilarity. Lovingly crafted by Italy's top comedian and most popular filmmaker, it's that rare comedy that takes on a daring and ambitious subject and proves worthy of it.",
    "One of the greatest films about the civilian experience of war ever made anywhere.",
    "To see someone even attempt bittersweet treatment of this subject is surprising, but to largely pull it off is a major feat.",
    "A rare blend of comedy and tenderness whose point is not the horrors of war but the lengths a parent will go to protect his child's innocence.",
    "Finds the right notes to negotiate its delicate subject matter.",
    "Benigni effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage. And he draws from this an unpretentious, enormously likable film that plays with history both seriously and mischievously. Piety has no place here, nor do tears until the final reel. Life is Beautiful plays by its own rules",
    "The concept is not so much nihilistic as it is realistic, and the fact that Benigni has made such fine distinctions so powerfully clear is amazing and moving.",
    "It's a high-wire act without a net, and Benigni pulls it off with astounding grace and sensitivity.",
    "In one bold stride, Benigni has set himself apart from the rank and file of funnymen, joining the elite class of clowns who know that humor and heartbreak are only a howl of pain apart.",
    "If, like Benigni, you were born after World War II, it reassures us that he hasn't forgotten the innate seriousness of his subject matter, and that despite its grimness, he still thinks life is beautiful.",
    "Ultimately, Benigni's comic refinery merely transforms the banality of evil into a lesser sin -- the evil of banality.",
    "Succeeds better than it ought to, largely because of the personality and prodigious talents of its director and star, the Italian comedian Roberto Benigni.",
    "It's the depiction of the love and sacrifice of a father for a son that makes Life is Beautiful worthwhile.",
    "Sluggish, uneven and lacking in rhythm, it nonetheless has enough pathos and winning humor.",
    "While it celebrates the triumph of humor, invention and the human spirit, Life Is Beautiful is not the transporting experience it might have been. Benigni knows how to make us laugh, but he has not yet figured out how to make us cry.",
    "Starts out as sentimental whimsy and ends as sentimental kitsch.",
    "Manages to incorporate all these things into a moving yet unsentimental story about the beauty of maintaining one's wits while stumbling blindly in the insane no man's land that lies beyond wit's end.",
    "While it's futile to pretend that Life Is Beautiful completely triumphs--it's simply too tough a concept to sustain--what is surprising about this unlikely film is that it succeeds as well as it does.",
    "Has one of the most stupendously tasteless premises in cinema history, and much of the time when this movie tries to beckon a smile, the effect is closer to astonished nausea.",
    "Benigni sets out to do the impossible.",
    "Has good intentions, but its exaggerated celebration of quick-witted improvisation ultimately trivializes the human and historical horrors evoked by the story.",
    "Life Is Beautiful is funny (kinda) and even tasteful (sorta). But in its fantasy of divine grace, it is also nonsense.",
    "Benigni wants to tell a poignant fable rooted in the love between a father and son, but everything hinges on whether one finds his gags inspired or tasteless. Humor can only save some of us.",
    "The director gives us not just a pop Holocaust but a prettified, palatable Holocaust.",
    "The indifference of the proceedings and the hero's slapstick behavior to the everyday realities of the camps borders on the nauseating.",
    "In this climate, turning even a small corner of this century's central horror into feel-good popular entertainment is abhorrent.",
    "The point, I think, is the sheer callous inappropriateness of comedy existing within the physical reality of the camps -- even the imagined reality of a movie.",
    "Benigni's movie made me want to throw up."

The story is terrible and dull whereas the characters in this film disrespected the reality regarding the treatment of the Jews. It makes no sense from the story line whatsoever and Robert Bengini made the theme cheerful and hopeful which doesn't seem to add well for a movie to be based on a WWII and Holocaust setting. Even though it's presented on a matter of fiction but reflects the reality of the event, It's a bad movie that you shouldn't watch. Steven Spielberg's \"Schindler's List\" will always be the truly emotional and superior film based on the events that happened in the Holocaust. Why? because it's a Spielberg film and he does not disappoint and the fact he comprises reality more than fiction. Unlike Roberto Bengini, he is disrespecting the theme by creating a film that is presented in a cheerful matter and thinking that it's best to add a level of inconsistency  to the story line.",

It has a ton of slapstick humor that you would expect from the Looney Tunes. The second half, however, is simply, a father trying to protect his son from the reality of the situation. Guido (Benigni) pulls of ludicrous stunts, just so his son doesn’t find out they are in a concentration camp. The idea of the film isn’t to tell a real serious Holocaust story, the camps are more of a backdrop for the real story. As I said before, the treatment of the camps is treated as somewhat of a joke. Guido and his son are able to contact Dora (Braschi) over the loudspeakers and not be caught or killed. Conversely, in the novel Night, Elie Wiesel sees Idek, Wiesel’s superior, with a polish girl. Wiesel receives 25 lashes on his back. If you want a realistic interpretation of the Holocaust then this film is not for you, but if you want a heartfelt story about a father willing to do anything and everything for his son, I would recommend this film to you.",

A film about the Holocaust, the film shows how one man's energy and passion for life can shield his young son from the atrocities surrounding him. The film toes the line between tragedy, comedy, and romance, throughout, but knocks all of them out of the park. It is heart warmingly funny and Roberto Benigni has an absolutely irresistible charm that almost distracts the viewer from the horror they are watching. The romantic element is touching and brilliantly executed (it also has the best non-sex sex scene, I've seen). Finally, the tragedy is hard-hitting. This film will truly break your heart and those last 20 minutes are guaranteed to at least leave you on the brink of tears. As a whole, Life Is Beautiful is a wonderful film that differs from other Holocaust films in that it brings some a different human element to the table, other than despair. Rather, it injects an adrenaline shot of hope and optimism that is largely unmatched in film.",

The movie takes a tragic event that happened in our history and twists it to seem comical and happy but shows what they had to go through and what they did to elderly people and children. I didn’t expect some things that happened to happen. I thought that when the guard took Guido and we heard the gun shot that he had stolen the gun from the guard and shot him. The movie take twists and turns to throw viewers off and think something else is going to happen. This movie makes the holocaust seem like it is not all bad and it lightens it up a bit when thinking about the holocaust and what they put them through. It shows that even something as tragic as the holocaust can still be portrayed as a comic and happy story. It takes all the bad out of what happened and brings out the good and hopefully puts in the back of your mind that it happened but we can make sure that nothing like this will ever happen again. In the end of the movie, it shows that with all the events Joshua had to go though, from hiding from Nazi’s to knowing his father was killed, he still can have a happy ending to a movie. After reading the book “Maus” and watching this movie, they have similarities that the characters go though. “Maus” shows more tragedy then the movie and it is more straight forward with what happened then the movie is. It’s makes it more difficult to read because it shows a lot more tragedy then the movie does. They both are showing the same story but in different ways so we can see how different people lived during the holocaust. Overall, The movie made something so tragic into a comedy and helped people understand that even though this event was very tragic on our history we can still get something good out of it.",

These reviews, especially written by critics couldn't be more wrong. This movie is about kindness and showing humility in a time of evil. The main character Guido and his son Joshua are taken the concentration camps because they are Jewish along with Guido's own father, and his wife, Dora, hops on the train because she cannot bare the idea of them suffering while she gets to live in her home. Guido knows to some extent what's in store for them, yet he neglects to tell his son because he wants Joshua's innocence to remain in tact. He wants to protect Josh because the innocence of a child is the one thing that can give light in times of darkness. Guido tells Joshua that instead of being sent to the camps and being tortured, they are participating in a tough competition, now as I said, Guido tells him this to protect this little child's innocence. Joshua is a little child and he is not yet ready to understand how their world works. This movie is about finding the light in even the darkest of times and staying true to yourself no matter what life throws at you. Yes, this movie dramatizes the camps, yet we are still able to see the cruelty of the Nazis. Guido keeps his comedy going to bring life and happiness to his son to the very end. He ends up sacrificing himself for Dora and Joshua, and even makes fun of the Nazi walking him to his death in front of his hidden son. The children are our future an they need to be protected, that is what this movie says. Yes, it is dramatized, yes it is a bit romanticized but what movie isn't to a certain extent? This movies still shows how good humanity can be. This is a movie I highly recommend. It does not deserve the rating it received.",

Its portrayal of interwar Italy is mostly idyllic, showcasing stately architectures and carefree people. Paying little heed to profound political, social and economic problems in interwar Italy, Life Is Beautiful indicates antisemitism as the sole reason for the rise of fascism. In reality, fascism came to Italy 4 years after the end of Great War. In light of unstable constitutional monarchy and fragmented political parties, the chief agenda of National Fascist Party of Italy included expansion of Italian territories. The most serious problem of Life Is Beautiful, however, is its misleading representation of concentration camps. Virtually no one sheds blood in the film, the greatest horror being a blurred version of piled bodies. The film leaves the audience with such an impression that the imprisoned merely suffered from doing heavy physical labors. In reality, however, in an environment where lack of food and water was common and any negligence could cause public punishment, the imprisoned were deprived of human dignity (Levi, 1986, p. 47, p. 117). Holocaust memories apparently contradict with the movie plots that Guido and Joshua are in good spirit and that Guido often disrespects the officers. Overall, Life Is Beautiful compromises historical accuracy for a simple story and a clear moral message. Just as the opening line states, “like a fable, there is sorrow; like a fable, it is full of wonder and happiness,” this movie reduces history to a lighthearted fable. It may be educational or inspirational, but the misrepresentation of interwar Italy and concentration camps reveals historical ignorance and cultural insensitivity.",

For example, the wife (Dora) was an amazing caring wife and mother. She was not Jewish and was willing to go to the concentration camps just to be with her family. Giorgio Cantarini is just a little boy who really pulled off the role of Joshua. Yet, considering that some parts of the movie is not historically accurate and has a little too much humor, I would not suggest this movie to others if they were going to watch it to learn about the Holocaust. An example of too much humor would be when the father (Guido) was marching around being silly in front of his son, but the next thing that happened was his death.

Some Italians harassed the Jews that lived in Italy; they did horrible acts to their families. The Italians thought they were the superior race, and they did not compare themselves to others like the Germans. In the movie, the people of Italy were living the good life because they had an alliance with the Germans. So they gathered up all the Jews and put them in a cattle car that could only hold 50 people but the Nazis put a hundred in one cattle car.

A deeply moving blend of dismal hilarity. Crafted by Italy's top comedian and most popular filmmaker Roberto Benigni. Guido, a Jewish bookseller, who marries his dream girl and lives the fantasy life with a son Joshua,  Although the movie was about the holocaust, that was surprisingly not the point at all. In-fact Roberto does very well at softening the impact of the holocaust.The first half of the film has nary a mention of Jews or war, we wouldn’t even suspect Guido as Jewish This movie was about sacrifice, hope and a loving passion.  Benigni   provides a most stunning example of precisely the sacrifice a parent is capable of making for their child in the gloomiest of hours. at the end Joshua narrates that this was his father's gift to him. in relation to a book called Maus by Art Spiegelman, tells a graphic novel story about his father and his sacrifices in the holocaust, on the flip side this is a son's gift to his father. the book parallels some of the same cinematic understanding of character relationship ratio. This is where character are placed strategically on screen. and simple dry humor.  like the book Maus this movie also has a good balance of humor to dismal ideas. Life is beautiful is an inspiring movie that makes you wonder of all the things you have and shows you not to take it for granted   the teachings and moral implications of this movie go beyond the Cliche story line and finds a way to deeply connect with viewers.",

A fresh and different look at the Holocaust captivates theWith an award winning film with a whole different perspective on what the Holocaust looked like, Roberto Benigni brings out the best in him even in the darkest hours of human history. A fresh and different look at the Holocaust captivates the audience and I in a way that isn’t determined by eye-candy or flashy action scenes. Life is Beautiful is one for the masses to definitely watch.\rTaking place in Italy, Guido, a happy-go-lucky kind of man is happily traveling across Italy, and bumps into his future wife, Dora. As time goes on they get closer and eventually have a son. Once Germany starts its warpath however, Guido and his family’s life takes a dark turn as the Nazi’s begin to round up Jews and enemies alike. Guido and his family struggle through hardship and strife as they try to survive the hellish world of the Holocaust. However, the movie isn’t as serious and dark as one would think a Holocaust film would be. Roberto Benigni’s comical character comes into play throughout the whole movie, not disappointing any audience wishing to see his funny side.\rThe comedy of the movie was splendidly executed at the right times without much overextension or too much visible effort. Guido’s entertaining personality is both a treat to the audience and to the movie itself, with Guido providing perfect synergy with the rest of the cast. With the cast and characters, the development of some characters were slow as they didn’t have much screen time in the movie, such as Dora, but in the end, the movie gives a good feel of all the characters’ personalities.\rThe real shining star of this movie was the relationship between main characters, Guido and his son Joshua. In the worst times of their life, Guido somehow manages to persuade his infant boy that they’re actually playing a game, with the reward being a military standard tank. Knowing that the Holocaust will heavily affect Joshua if he gets out of their situation, Guido entertains his son with his lighthearted humor and with the promise of the tank, while keeping his son’s life and mentality intact. This unbreakable bond between father and son showcases how well Roberto used his character to work with Joshua, allowing the directing, writing and acting to really shine out.\rWhile how the movie actually plays out and presents the predicaments of each character may seem a bit far-fetched, it still is an unforgettable movie. A man that risks everything for his family in the worst of times and somehow making some comic relief is a hard piece of chemistry to get right, yet Roberto pulled it off nearly flawlessly. Life is Beautiful does indeed show that life truly can be beautiful like the film itself was.",

This movie won 3 Oscars, which is an incredible feat, considering this is a foreign film made in Italy. All other critic sites award this film with high scores and pleasant words, hailing it as a masterpiece. Life is Beautiful, or La Vita E Bella, is the highest grossing Italian movie of all time, and with good reason. This film is tragic, emotional, dark, but also funny, optimistic, and filled with wonder. Many people who have problems with the film argue that it makes fun of the horrors of the Holocaust, making the event appear not as impactful or terrifying as it really was. The film appears to do this because of the father's imagination and the stories he tells his son to avoid revealing their true situation and scaring him. The focus of the film is not the Holocaust, a concentration camp doesn't even appear until halfway through the movie. Yes, Life is Beautiful has several scenes that focus on the Fascist Regime, the Nazis, and the horrific things that happened at the camps, but the story and the charm of the film come from the family. The focus is the love between the father and his wife and son and how imagination and optimism can conquer fear. The emotions in the film are too real and the characters so endearing that it is impossible to dismiss the film because of it's \"inaccuracies\". Those who wrote the reviews to give the amazing feature a measly 59 must be out of their minds to ignore the power and wonderful themes of Life is Beautiful. Life is Beautiful is a movie about how life is beautiful, through the powers of love, compassion, creativity, and family. Those who can't appreciate that about this film are really as dark and depressing as the Holocaust itself.",

The characters are moving, particularly Guido and his son. Benigni shone with a performance at the highest level. The soundtrack, signed by Nicola Piovani, was excellent, maybe one of the best soundtracks of that decade. The film received three Oscars (Best Foreign Movie, Best Leading Actor and Best Soundtrack) and conquered the critics and the public in Europe and U.S. This is a touching and poignant film, which shows the human need to survive to the worsts disasters and always have at heart the living flame of hope.

I rated it an eight out of ten because Guido (Benigni) was inspirational by making light of a difficult situation for his son (Joshua). The setting of the movie was in Italy during the Holocaust. Guido, a Jewish man, married a non-Jewish woman (Dora). After they got married they had a son named Joshua who is half Jewish. The father and son were forced on a train to a concentration camp where their lives were in jeopardy. Dora was not forced to the camp, however, she willingly went to be with her family. Dora (the mom) was not able to reunite with her family because she was separated when she got there. Guido played a game with his son to help him survive the camp. Even though Guido faced traumatization, he still smiled through these difficult times. When you watch the movie Life is Beautiful viewers feel compassion for Guido as he tried to make the situation better for his son. This movie did not show the horrific scenes and killings that occurred during the Holocaust. Instead, it enlightened the viewers to see the courageous side of the Jews. Overall, the movie describes the journey on how the family tries to survive the Holocaust. I would recommend this movie to anyone who finds history interesting. Life is Beautiful is enjoyable because I admired the family relationship between Guido and Joshua. The book Night was similar to the movie since in both the father and son experienced the journey and struggles of the Holocaust together. If you have not seen the movie it is important you do because it is life changing.",

The beginning shows Guido trying to get Dora to love him. While there are many roadblocks, he eventually succeeds and grows up to be the father of a son named Joshua, as well as owning a bookstore. However, propaganda starts being put up that labels the Jews (which Guido happens to be) as the enemies. Soon enough, the once-happy family has to be taken to the concentration camps ran by the Nazis. Now, Guido and Dora must survive the Holocaust while the father keeps Joshua unaware of the terrors around him. The characterization of the cast of Life is Beautiful is amazing. Guido and Joshua really feel like a duo of father and son, with Guido trying to entertain his child as much as possible in a horrible place like a concentration camp. Sound design (such as music) excels as every sound and song fits with the setting and the cinematography show the scenery in great angles with perspective.However, this movie isn’t perfect. A minor issue is that this movie is entirely in Italian. While subtitles are provided, it may feel odd to some that they can’t hear this movie in a native language. The second issue is how the Holocaust is portrayed. The movie gives a bigger focus on the cast rather than the events around them. This makes sense, as ⅓ of the movie was to develop these characters. But since they’re living in such an awful era of time, it’s odd that only snippets of what happened in the camps were shown.

The plot went smoothly. This movie was filled with a love story, the Holocaust, and a happy family all compacted together. At first, Guido, who is one of the main characters, is a waiter in town and falls in love with Dora. I thought that the movie throughout was funny and brilliant because Guido would plan something out when he came across Dora to make her love him. In one of the scenes, Guido always sees a woman dropping her keys out her window, and when he brought her to that location, he said to pray to Mary for the keys and they dropped. Eventually, Guido married Dora and had a little boy named Joshua. Guido owned a bookstore and enjoyed life. Despite that, Guido was sent to the concentration camp with his son, yet he still gave his son hope to make it out. Guido was a kind loving person who sacrificed himself for his young son so he can live on with Dora.  I loved how Guido was always positive with his son and even right before he died, he gave a sign to his son that it was going to be alright. This movie is much like Night because they all start out with a family and after the Nazis invade, they’re all sent to camp. The father dies during the camp. Elie, who is much like Joshua, finds a way to survive, and at the end, the army saves the prisoners.",

My favorite character from the movie was Guido because he has the most insane attitude ever where he is always happy, positive and clever. He is especially clever because he's in love with this girl named Dora, and he uses his mischievous skills to unlock her heart to him. Dora is a lady that lives a normal life but always ends up walking in Guido's way. She was already in a relationship with a powerful man and had a job at a local school but on her engagement day she went off to with Guido because she was in love with him. They got married and had a son named Joshua which was only a young boy at the time. He believed what his dad said most of the time because when they were in the camp Joshua actually thought he would win a tank if he got 1,000 points. He was good at following his father's orders and with his advice and help Joshua managed to escape the camp without dying and rejoiced with his mother (Dora). I would recommend this movie to view because it has a unique perspective where half of the movie is joyful and comedic while the other half is dark, so it gives a good contrast to the movie overall. I would also recommend it for having good quality in drama, and it emphasizes the emotion of the characters giving the movie a deeper understanding.  Further, the boy and the father had a close relationship and his father did everything he could to keep his son happy and safe during the scene when his Dad was caring an anvil (100 kilos) up the stairs.",

This movie is the most entertaining, funny and touching movies I've ever watched. It's a brilliant tale about a Father's love for his son, and how you can always look towards the bright side of life. The use of colours of this film were so great. It starts as a vibrant, colourful comedy and later moves to a dull, bleak and depressing drama. It can play with emotions like no other movie, and is an outstanding example of genius film making. This is, without a doubt, the best movie I've ever watched.",

It becomes more bittersweet and poignant when things take a more sober turn, plot wise. I kind of respected the father for trying to make light of such a serious situation and I did find myself giggling at times, although it did feel somewhat wrong to do so. This is very much a thought provoking watch - a film I'd definitely recommend, though the only thing that spoilt it a bit was that some of the things that happened, people bumping into other people and people managing to get to certain places, seemed a little unlikely frankly but for the most part its a pretty decent film.",

There’s no trivialization of the Holocaust. Yes, it simplifies it a bit, but it’s not a film about the Holocaust so it doesn’t need to spend as much time on the realism aspect. It’s a film about a father who loves his son and doesn’t want him to suffer so he makes light of all the hardships that death camps brought upon their victims. The man literally shouldered his own emotional burden as well as taking on his son’s at the same time. Through exhaustion, anxiety, and probably a fair bit of depression he continued the ruse for the mental health of his little boy. It would have been nice to see intimate moments interspersed where we get more of a glimpse into his true emotional state, but the lack of emotional transparency doesn’t kill the film or it’s intended purpose. So long as you don’t go into this film expecting it to be a Schindler’s List, I think you will enjoy it.",

And I would be angered as well if Benigni was trying to make a drama or even a documentary. But this movie isn't ultimately about the Holocaust, it is about hope and persistence. The narrative isn't dishonest in any way by trying to sentimentalize the horrible events of the camp. On the contrary, the protagonist has to endure all of it while staying optimistic for his child. The story could have never happened, but at the same time, the depiction of the prisoners' hope and strength is spot on (when compared to other Holocaust movies, where the Jews are portrayed \"truly\", but simply as a lifeless grey mass without any thought). Humour is and always will be a lifting life force, especially when tragedies occur (seen also in CHarlie Chaplin's Kid). This movie ingeniously puts the father's optimism beside the horrors of the camp, so the contrast between these two speaks even bigger volumes implicitly (rather than showing explicit and brutal treatment of the prisoners). In conclusion, the humour here is not used to make us laugh at the horrific events of the Holocaust, on the other hand, it represents the upper hand in such a tragic situation. I'm giving 8 because of the sweet and optimistic finale, which could depict the aftermath of the liberation bit more troublesome. Still, the hope and spirit of the father did survive eventually, so therefore I can understand the sentiment. Brilliant movie.",
