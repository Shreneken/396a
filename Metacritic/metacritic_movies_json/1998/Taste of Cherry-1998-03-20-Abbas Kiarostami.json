    "Exquisite.",
    "An exquisite return to cinema at its most intimate, allusive and humanist. Without a firebomb, muscle-bound star or gunfight in sight, it explodes with the most fragile and combustible substance on earth: human nature.",
    "This outstanding work — so meditative — is clearly an affirmation of life (and never more provocatively than in the film’s unusual coda, in which moviemaking itself becomes part of the discussion). It’s also so grounded in the real emotional scope of ordinary people that the magnitude of the subject is answered in the most mysteriously matter-of-fact way.",
    "A simple, serene and occasionally humorous film about a subject that is complex, emotional and usually treated with solemnity.",
    "Characteristically, Kiarostami's Palme d'Or winner is low on narrative drive, slowly but steadily revealing more and more information, visual and verbal, until we are totally caught up in his protagonist's psychological and ethical dilemma.",
    "A warning: The pace is very slow in Taste of Cherry, with long takes and leisurely, repetitious shots of Mr. Badii's car twisting through a hilly countryside. Kiarostami is in no rush, but the respect and love he shows for his characters, and the confidence and simplicity of his technique, make Taste of Cherry a satisfying experience.",
    "I have to report that I, personally, just don't get it. I intellectually understand what occurs in the movie; I just can't make the leap into calling it a humanistic treasure about life's big questions. Slow and monotonous, the film moves at a deliberate pace and culminates in a meta-fictional moment that is either infuriatingly trite or enigmatic.",
    "As noble as his ideals are, watching a series of interminably lengthy conversations inside a car makes for stultifying viewing. And the abrupt ending, which highlights the fictional nature of the whole enterprise, is mystifying.",
    "Excruciatingly boring."

Badii is intent to end his life, and all he asks for is someone who could bury him as he's lying in his grave he's already dug out. We have no idea why exactly Badii is willing to kill himself. And in this lack of explanation not only we're asked to focus on the 99-minute journey instead of the destination, but we're also implicitly informed that Badii's soul is no longer being tormented but it's already gasping out its last breath; which means it's not dead yet, though. If it hadn't been for Homayoun Ershadi, Badii would've seemed dead, even as he's driving his truck. For Eshadi's sorrow-laden eyes expose the misery that burdens Badii's soul and, in turn, prompts him to \"free [himself] from this life,\" and that what makes him clutching at a straw even if he himself is completely unaware of that. There's nothing surrounding him that could urge him to give the idea a second thought. All we see are some bleak and dismally empty and desolate landscapes. The sound of silence permeate the screen to reflect the excruciating ennui Badii feels, and the only sounds that break the silence intermittently are the cacophonous sound of machines or other jarring sounds. Kiarostami also detaches him, and us, from the world Badii has long forsaken, making us listen to conversations with the speakers almost off-screen. And the only life form Badii seems to observe are not of the people he interacts with—simply because his mind is solely concentrating on seeking someone to assist him do what he wants—but those of crows. Along his journey, innate goodness of human beings like \"refraining from doing any harm to anyone\" or \"offering a hand whenever encountering someone in need or trouble\" are manifested, but so long as these traits interfere with Badii's intent, they come off as hurdles to what he plans to do and they just end up pass by him unnoticed. As he's in a stage beyond any rational thinking, religious and philosophical advices fall on deaf ears as well. No one can change his mind. A long lecturing would definitely be of no help, unless beneath its veneer of didacticism lies a life-affirming power and an irrefutable optimism of an epiphanic impact. What kept me from giving this five stars is that the lack of information about Badii distanced me emotionally from him at the beginning. Regardless, Taste of Cherry is a minimalist masterpiece that celebrates life by showing us its value and beauty hidden in its simplicity.",

The plot was rather slow and perhaps a little meandering. Its a sobering watch - an interesting one. I liked the discussions had, hearing different peoples opinions about a deeply personal matter.I'm not sure I'd specifically recommend it as such but its certainly not bad either.",
