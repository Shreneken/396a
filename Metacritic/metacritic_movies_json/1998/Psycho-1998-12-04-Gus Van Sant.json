  "summary": "Intrigued by the notion of taking an intact, undeniable classic and seeing what would happen if it were made again - with a nearly identical shooting script - but with contemporary filmmaking techniques, Gus Van Sant recreates the motion picture Psycho.  (Universal Studios)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Norman Bates is alive and well, and just a tad kinkier than you remember him.",
    "William H. Macy is fine as the detective Arbogast, wearing a hat he could have borrowed from Martin Balsam in the original role.",
    "The film is shot in color and includes an amped-up Danny Elfman version of Bernard Herrmann's haunting score.",
    "Funny and sort of creepy--a not bad little thriller with some peculiarly dated plot development.",
    "It remains the most structurally elegant and sneakily playful of thrillers. At least some things never change.",
    "May not be anything new, but it's still just as shocking.",
    "A faithful-unto-slavish remake of the 1960 Hitchcock classic, pic contains nothing to outrage or offend partisans of the original, yet neither does it stand to add much to their appreciation.",
    "If the original did not exist, would this picture be worth seeing?",
    "The movie doesn't stink. The performances are good, potentially great, especially Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates.",
    "In the shock department, the ante has been upped, way up, and a mere kitchen knife through a shower curtain just doesn't cut it any more.",
    "Van Sant's film feels as dated as Hitchcock's, and Hitchcock's has the better excuse.",
    "This Psycho seems a little nuts.",
    "As Norman Bates, Vince Vaughn makes us better appreciate how much Anthony Perkins brought to the original project. It's clear now that he owned the role and that he shares equally with Hitchcock the credit for making Psycho the memorable creep show it is -- and was.",
    "It's so slavishly similar to its predecessor - right down to the symbolic lettering on Marion's license plates - that there's little to spark fresh discussion except the acting.",
    "The thrill of the original is seeing a black-and-white, one-foot-on-the-floor, no-sex-please Hays Code world suddenly explode into a slasher movie. Our loss of innocence has, simply, changed all the rules.",
    "Hitchcock's Psycho had a lot more than watchability going for it. Van Sant's film impresses only on the level of a cinematic parlor trick, and while that makes it an interesting curiosity, the world doesn't need it.",
    "The response for anyone familiar with the original Psycho is likely to be restricted to a narrow range between briefly enjoyable déjà vu and mild disappointment. The movie lacks the chutzpah to even be a travesty.",
    "The movie is an invaluable experiment in the theory of cinema, because it demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.",
    "Redundant and unnecessary.",
    "Anne Heche is just another neo-noir minx on the make, while Vince Vaughn, grinning and leering as Norman Bates, sinks the movie.",
    "Van Sant's doomed and misguided experiment."

But this is really a very different film. Gus Van Sant's disturbing, psycho sexual execution is very stylish and unique. Vince Vaughn's goofy, insecure but oddly seductive Norman Bates is a underrated treat. Anne Heche, Viggo Mortensen and especially Julianne Moore's feisty take on their characters are all solid. Although the original film is undoubtedly superior. This unique reimagining pays the ultimate tribute to the material while retaining a dark magic of its own.",

HeBoy, even the late Alfred Hitchcock should've laughed this mess of a remake that hard. Psycho is one of my favorite horror movies of all time and what did they get, a nobody director and a wasted script. Hitchcock was right on one thing. He shouldn't need any color. Insult to injury, this shot-by-shot remake is definitely one of the worst remakes Hollywood needs to stay away. It's pretty stupid when you add Anne Heche, Vince Vaughn (as Young Norman Bates), and Gus Van Sant as a director who just doesn't know what the original version is all about. The original version features not only has one of the scariest theme songs of all time, but the shower scene where Bates slashed his wife is very memorable. At least, we desperately need a proper remake. But stick to the Hitchcock classic.",

Just modernizing the original with a bigger budget takes no creativity and falls into the tedium and redundancy which most horror fan's hate.\r Gus Van Sant's Psycho remake, where nearly every scene is \"copied exactly,\" is a perfect example of this. It was simply BORING. Even for those that never saw this first, the pacing is just too slow for the high-octane generations of the 90's and beyond.\r For a re-make to resonate with an audience that knows the original by heart, it has to deliver a new and different version while staying within the bounds of the original framework. We should be thankful because no director will try this again. For the secret formula to successful horror re-makes, watch 2012's The Evil Dead, 2004's Dawn of the Dead or David Cronenberg's The Fly (1986).",
