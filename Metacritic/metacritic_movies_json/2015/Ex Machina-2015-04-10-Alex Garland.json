  "critic_reviews": [
    "A riveting sci-fi investigation into humankind's experiments with A.I. (with pages from Spike Jonze's Her and Stanley Kubrick's 2001), Ex Machina marks the extremely able directing debut of British writer Alex Garland, of the novels \"The Beach\" and \"The Tesseract,\" and of the screenplays for Danny Boyle's \"28 Days Later\" . . . and \"Sunshine.\"",
    "Shrewdly imagined and persuasively made, Ex Machina is a spooky piece of speculative fiction that's completely plausible, capable of both thinking big thoughts and providing pulp thrills. But even saying that doesn't do this quietly unnerving film full justice.",
    "Sizzlingly smart and agreeably sententious, Mr. Garland’s film transcends some all-too-human imperfections with gorgeous images, astute writing and memorably strong performances.",
    "A rare and welcome exception to that norm.",
    "The picture is a triumph: it's arguably Garland’s tightest and most fascinating screenplay to date, brought to life with meticulous filmmaking and sensational performances. It's the first great film of 2015.",
    "It plays like Frankenstein meets Blade Runner via Hitchcock haunted by the ghosts of Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations, in a film that’s both highly literate and steeped in tense cat-and-mouse chills. Thematically epic – it demands to be seen at least twice and should fuel hours of debate — structurally it’s as lithe as Ava’s perfect mesh frame.",
    "Garland's original screenplay brims with intelligence, unafraid to let characters speak over our heads. Yet it remains a pulpy delight, due largely to its uniquely mad scientist.",
    "To dismiss Ex Machina as just another robot movie would be like calling the Grand Canyon a hole in the ground. It's one of the most original, smart, thought-provoking science fiction movies of recent years.",
    "It's great when a movie messes with your head. And Ex Machina, screenwriter Alex Garland's directorial debut, does just that, pretty much from start to finish. The writer of \"28 Days Later\" and \"Sunshine\" purports to examine A.I., or artificial intelligence. What he's really after is something at once more exotic and more relatable — and infinitely less predictable: human nature.",
    "[Mr. Garland] plays with visual contrasts — Mr. Isaac’s compact, muscled body and Mr. Gleeson’s long, drooping one, picture windows that look out onto an expansively lush landscape and windowless rooms that register as upmarket prison cells — that dovetail with the narrative’s multiple, amusingly deployed dualities: confinement and liberation, agency and submission, mind and body.",
    "With a stellar cast and seductive look, Ex Machina is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.",
    "If you’re going to go all-in with the gorgeous and chilling and sometimes ludicrous Ex Machina, if you’re going to buy into the lofty debates and the wiggy humor and the borderline misogynistic notion of the perfect woman, you’ll have to check your logic at the ticket counter.",
    "With Ex Machina, Garland makes an impressive debut as a director, spinning an unsettling futuristic thriller with the expertise and exquisite taste of a seasoned veteran.",
    "Alex Garland, the screenwriter of \"28 Days Later\" and \"Sunshine,\" makes an auspicious directorial debut with this suspenseful mystery.",
    "The director ensures this chamber piece of moral conundrums never seems too heavy-handed; his fluids camera roams through each room so that at no time does the theatrical set-up feel like a limitation.",
    "It's a smart film about the shrinking divide between man and robot. It's also a hoot, an anti-comedy where all of the jokes double as threats, and vice versa.",
    "Ex Machina exposes the insecurity of the male ego by showing his lust for creation as simply another strand in the patriarchal power game. The film's trajectory forms a thrilling, exciting corrective.",
    "This is bewitchingly smart science fiction of a type that’s all too rare. Its intelligence is anything but artificial.",
    "Stylish, elegant, tense, cerebral, satirical and creepy. Garland’s directorial debut is his best work yet, while Vikander’s bold performance will short your circuits.",
    "Ex Machina turns out to be far wittier and more sensual than its coolly unblemished exterior implies; it’s a trick that mirrors Ava’s own apparent Turing-test-defying evolution.",
    "A rattling and ruminative piece of speculative fiction, Ex Machina is good enough to wish it were even better.",
    "Ex Machina is a clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.",
    "The fact that Garland manages to cram in speculative ideas about the perils of a society that relies too heavily on technology is a bonus. In Ex Machina, love hurts, big time, for man and machine alike.",
    "A sci-fi movie that actually has intelligent things to say about science — that’s all too rare. It’s what we get in Ex Machina.",
    "A note of paranoia creeps in that nods to classic film noir on one hand and baroque misogyny on the other. Or maybe this is just Garland’s dank idea of what men do when they’re left to their own devices: Create dream mates from the flayed skin of their fantasies.",
    "In the final analysis, the movie doesn't offer much about the subject that hasn't been previously explored, but the soil is fertile and many ideas germinate.",
    "Alas, the movie cannot resolve its story in any sort of surprising or truly fresh way. Where's a good old-fashioned deus ex machina capper when you need it?\r\nIt's worth seeing nonetheless.",
    "Isaac's brilliant take on this bearded, buzz-cut and barefoot Dr. Frankenstein is a tour de force of shock and awe. Ex Machina springs surprises that will haunt you for a good long time.",
    "Ex Machina is beautiful and ominous and features another delicately nuanced performance from Isaac, who’s quickly making a habit of them. But in the end, for all of Garland’s ambition, his reach winds up exceeding his grasp. The film is as synthetic as Ava.",
    "Ex Machina is an “Island of Dr. Moreau” for the singularity era. It’s a cerebral, chilling and austere thriller that stokes our fears about digital privacy and artificial intelligence, a film that works largely thanks to a breakout mechanically empathetic turn by Alicia Vikander (“A Royal Affair,””Seventh Son”).",
    "Clever novelist and screenwriter Alex Garland makes a half-dandy directorial debut with Ex Machina, a sci-fi film that — like much of his work — fakes excitingly in the direction of breaking new ground before turning formulaic so fast.",
    "None of Ex Machina’s broad strokes are surprising: The story falls out so predictably at every stage that it can be frustrating. It’s the details that are surprising, and purposefully alarming.",
    "In the end, Ex Machina lives and dies by Alicia Vikander. The film clicks on when she first appears, and it dims every time she goes away.",
    "Make no mistake, this is a film of ideas—sadder, quieter, more delicate than the Hollywood sci-fi standard.",
    "A chilly, yet engrossing drama, elevated beyond its four-people-locked-in-a-house framework by the eerie beauty of the production design and the thoughtful curiosity of Garland’s screenplay.",
    "Ex Machina offers plenty of intriguing style but a spotty story line.",
    "It's a theme Mary Shelley brought us in \"Frankenstein,\" which was first published in 1818. That was almost 200 years ago. And while Ex Machina replaces the stitches and neck bolts with gears and fiber-optics, it all feels an awful lot like the same story.",
    "This exquisitely acted, genuinely creepy minimalist drama does spin its wheels a bit before a cool conclusion. But the movie has a spark of creativity not seen in “Chappie” or “Eva,” two of the recent robots-among-us flicks.",
    "With a sly dreaminess, Vikander steals the movie from the two males.",
    "Vikander’s spellbinding, not-quite-human presence (her synthetic skin is silky yet creepy) keeps us watching. But an only-too-obvious ‘twist’ and some clunky plotting...drain much of the credibility from a story which promised so much.",
    "The story ends in a muddled rush, leaving many unanswered questions. Like a newly launched high-end smartphone, Ex Machina looks cool and sleek, but ultimately proves flimsy and underpowered. Still, for dystopian future-shock fans who can look beyond its basic design flaws, Garland’s feature debut functions just fine as superior pulp sci-fi.",
    "In the end, more than just the machine remains an enigma."

Which is to say that when all is said and done Ex Machina isn't all that differentI was left a little disappointed by the ending. For all of it's expertly crafted tension this game of manipulation turned out exactly how I thought it would. Which is to say that when all is said and done Ex Machina isn't all that different from the countless other films out there with similar premises. The ride up to that point is still thrilling however, with strong themes and three exciting performances that will give you at least a little bit of doubt in regards to who can be trusted.The ominous soundtrack and the fact that I already knew that things weren't what they seemed filled me with unease. This is something Alex Garland made excellent use of to create a very unnerving atmosphere and reveals that come off as even more twisted than they already would have. For me this was freakier than most of the horror films I've watched. Of course the concept of playing mind games with AI already deeply disturbs me. That's not to take away from the performances of Oscar Isaac and Alicia Vikander though. Those two are key reasons things feel so dangerous.The back-and-forth pull between which of their characters the protagonist would be better off trusting hinges on the question of what it means to actually be human. Isaac's character may be a little unhinged, but he is another person so it stands to reason that while he is manipulating his house guest in some way, he's probably not a real threat. Ava on the other hand is an inhuman entity unlike anything else Gleeson's character would have previously encountered. We don't know if she feels empathy enough to not slaughter anyone she comes in contact with if she were to be set free. She's clearly hasn't had the most desirable \"life.\" That could very well have led to a hatred of humans. A lifeform she could view as inferior anyway. Vikander gives a suitably alien performance that provides Ava with a certain disconnection from her flesh and blood counterparts. Is she using her sexuality to manipulate a lonely and naïve individual, or is it possible for her to actually feel something more than a need to deceive?Ex Machina is another movie about the dangers of playing God. It's really good at getting you to ask questions. Certain twists and the ending itself are easy to predict. Meaning that it doesn't deviate too much from convention story-wise. Yet it's never robbed of atmosphere or tension so this is still a very effective thriller. It's also an intelligent piece of science fiction. One with a sexual angle that stems from the very human condition of never wanting to be alone and belief that if we aren't screwing, we aren't living. Alex Garland wasn't just satisfied with getting under our skin. He wanted to get inside our heads as well. And I, for one, think he succeeded rather marvelously. Managing to make something gorgeous in the process.8.7/10",

The premise is simple enough...\rGuy working for a big 'search engine' style company \"wins\" a competition to spend time with the company's mysterious and God-like CEO at his top secret research facility/retreat.\r Upon arriving he discovers the CEO is an incredibly eccentric man, overbearing, aggressive, drinking heavily and using stimulants to 'recover' the morning after.\r The guy is introduced to the CEO's latest and most far-reaching idea. Artificial Intelligence, a digital consciousness drawn from the billions of inputs made into the company's search engines and refined into an adaptive algorithm.\r This consciousness is personified into a robot, a stunningly attractive female robot (naturally), and the guy is asked to go in and interact with it/her and discover any flaws in how she reacts/responds. The idea being whether she possesses the capability to mimic human responses and whether it can constitute emotional depth in what is a purely digital/binary construct.\r As the film progresses it becomes clear the CEO has some mental instability issues, and there is a darker, more subversive rationale for why he seeks the answers.\r The guy becomes the one developing emotional contexts, to the point where he has to 'help' the robot escape the limitations of a couple of rooms in this way out in the middle of nowhere facility\rAnd the robot? Is she mimicking the deviousness and instability of the CEO, whilst developing a deeper sense of empathy for the guy? Is she the one who is manipulating them both???\r The three stars of the film play disparate characters.\r Oscar Isaac plays the CEO and billionaire Nathan Bateman, heavily bearded and over the top, his performance is probably the nearest to being 'by the book', the depth coming at the beginning of the movie as he monologues about the idea of AI and the infinite possibilities that could exist.\r Domhnall Gleeson plays programmer Caleb Smith, the 'nobody' who is plucked from his desk and and computer to 'work' on assessing the AI and how it learns and reacts. His performance is more muted, and bridges the middle part of the film.\r Alicia Vikander plays Ava, the robot with the latest version of Bateman's AI. Clearly the standout acting part of the movie she captures both the innocence and naivety of what is a 'new' life-form, whilst also trying to hide her own insecurities and sense of self preservation.\r In terms of film-making, it's well directed and scored. The cinematography is also excellent, with fantastic use of different techniques to produce the fantastic visual effects. As the (debut) Director and screenwriter, Alex Garland's desire to translate his own thoughts and ideas onto the Big Screen does resonate throughout, and this is also highlighted by the great performances from everyone in the film, not just the three 'stars'.\r However, for everything that is great about the movie, it's all undone by a muddled script. Great story and screenplay are all for nought if what is being conveyed in the words people are speaking either makes little or no sense, or relies on vague explanations that don't give you an insight into the characters thought process.\rOK, we're not talking about something as hapless as 'The Architect' and his nonsensical monologue at the end of Matrix Reloaded, but it's a lack of consistency in both expositional and character developmental dialogue that I found difficult to accept.\rIt just uses the 'catch all' trope of creating a scenario that exists to facilitate the movie, rather than the movie facilitating a means for something creative and thought-provoking to exist. Which was very disappointing indeed.\r Overall, it is an interesting film in that you approach a well worn path from a different direction. Alicia Vikander lights up the screen whenever she appears on it. And the twist ending ties up all the loose ends nicely, and leaves open a possibility for a potential sequel.\r I'd recommend it, just don't expect the narrative and plot devices used to stand up to some good old 'human' thinking!",

There are so many great things about it, and the one false note I find is in the first act. Many dialogue can be done much better, and \"history of God\" scene does not work. However, as the movie goes on, the script becomes better and dialogue feels much more genuine. Almost all sci-fi films have a problem with exposition: since the story happens in the future, the audience would not know about it. Ex Machina handles the exposition very well. In the helicopter scene at the beginning, we did not know the boss is rich because someone tells us so, but because the helicopter has been flying on its territory for years. This is a very nice approach to tell the audience an important information. But the greatest thing about the film is its theme. Never have I ever seen a movie so thoroughly and beautifully explored the identity of an A.I.. Ava has been perfectly portrayed as an attractive, creepy, also terrifying character. Overall, the movie is really really good. The music is also suitable for the sci-fi filmmakers out there. A lot of the theories and Ava's characters in the film are worth learning about. If the script for the first act can be done just a little bit better, I would just have no problem with it.",

The issues are kind of looking at what skynet in the terminator franchise was like except in a more subtle and no where near as destructive way. The questions arise; do we trust technology too much? Will it be what ultimately destroys us and takes over us but only as a part of evolution? With how we are taught to dedicate ourselves to certain things are we any more human than a robot with a thought process, do we both lack a sort of empathy for humans? Yes, this film is a thinker.\rThe film is acted brilliantly (partly in due to brilliant writing of the characters by Garland) with only a cast of 4 people, 3 of which have dialogue. The tension between Gleeson and Isaac's characters is a sight to behold as you feel stuck in the claustrophobic utopia of Isaac's abode. There is a constant threat of who is telling the truth and who isn't throughout along with the feeling that you are being left in the dark whist watching.\rHowever, certain issues i found with the film were these. The pacing, whilst not bad at all, was monotonous. It literally struck one note, the pacing staying the same throughout which wasn't a bad pace but never really made you feel you'd reached the climax of the film at any point. I also found the ending a little too open, not really having a full(ish) resolution at the conclusion, which left me feeling a little empty.\rOne other thing to note, the sound design for this film was just glorious to listen to, my ears tuned in on every sound in the film all the time.\rDefinitely worth the watch for our upcoming Star Wars actors and for it's impressive philosophy.",

He’d made his billions on the Internet, and was nowThe movie, Ex Machina, had a simple plot: A young billionaire genius, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), spends a fortune to build a hideaway in a remote region, the only way in or out by helicopter.  He’d made his billions on the Internet, and was now working on creating humanoid robots (but only females).  A young programmer, Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), working for his company, has won a contest, the prize being a week spent with the billionaire in his hideaway, participating in a Turing Test of Artificial Intelligence, specifically in the person of Ava (Alicia Vikander), a beautiful robot.  Caleb is to see if Ava is capable of more than factual intelligence, capable of human emotions.  Ava and Caleb interact under the watchful eye (and omnipresent cameras) of Nathan.  That’s the plot setup and I’ll leave it at that, no spoilers here.  But the whole idea of artificial intelligence is intriguing and has been dealt with in science fiction from the very beginning of the genre, most notably in Isaac Asimov’s I Robot.  We also saw it in Her, the\rSpike Jonze film starring Joaquin Phoenix who fell in love with his cell phone operating system named Samantha (Scarlett Johannson).  Today, however, we’re actually on the brink of creating robots and artificial intelligence that in the near future will take over most of our tasks: cars that drive themselves, planes that fly themselves, houses that clean themselves and cook our meals, machines that operate on us and take care of all our medical needs, assembly lines that automatically create other machines to take care of all our basic needs.  I just read that Gartner, an information technology research firm, predicts that by 2025 AI and robots will take over a third of current jobs, one-third by 2025 with the likelihood of two-thirds and three-thirds in the not too distant future.  Does that mean that mankind may in fact get to that Utopia envisioned by Arthur C. Clarke in his novel Childhood’s End? A time when all of man’s needs will be met by robotics and no one will have to work to survive, but will be able to engage in whatever activities they enjoy?  I hope so.  But back to Ex Machina and its considerations of how far artificial intelligence might go.  Would it be possible to create machines that not only know and use all of man’s knowledge but could also be programmed to feel as humans feel?  To appreciate music and beauty, to know love and hate, joy and regret, shame and triumph, sympathy, empathy, pleasure, even sexual pleasure?  Could we give a machine a sense of humor?  Mark Twain sardonically said, “Man is the only animal that blushes.  Or needs to.”  Could a robot blush?  Would a robot need to blush?  Fear seems to be the only feeling we wouldn’t need to program into an android.  What would a machine fear?  Death or injury?  No, that’s strictly a human feeling.  But even death might one day be defeated when we could store a person’s memories and experiences on a hard drive, to which later thoughts and experiences could be added endlessly, living in an artificial body and switching to another artificial body when the first one wears out.  A robotic immortality.  Science and technology are expanding exponentially and the future may be closer than we think.  Oh, yes, and by the way, go see Ex Machina.  It will lead you down the same introspective paths to the future that I found.",

Frequently with movies I'm too busy picking at plot holes and obvious contrivances to enjoy them. But not this one, because there weren't any that I could see. Everything that happened was driven by the actions the characters took and those actions were made sense with what we saw of their personality and motivations.  The most important thing for a movie like this to have is logical, internal consistency, and this one has that. There were a few times while watching it where I thought the writers had made a mistake or opened a plot hole; but each of those times, within a few minutes, the characters on screen addressed my concern in a way that fit within the story and the characters. Not many movies get this right but this one does.\r All that said, while the plot didn't play out exactly as I expected going in, it doesn't have any completely out-of-left-field twists either. If you are paying attention, you can mostly guess where it's going.\r The movie contains some intense scenes, full frontal female nudity, and frank sexual dialog. None of it is completely gratuitous, it's all in service of setting an atmosphere or adding depth to a character. But still, this isn't a movie to take the kids to.

Looking back, this could have been a play, and indeed, I can easily imagine it on Broadway. On the one hand, the set pieces, largely in interiors, must have helped bring the project in at a relatively modest budget, without making the production look cheap. However, the “lust of the eye,” which draws us out of our caves to movie theaters, is left largely unsatisfied. I offer “Blade Runner” – 30+ years old now – as an example of a big budget menagerie, on a similar topic, which can last in the mind’s eye for years. The images toward the end of Ex Machina suggest what might have been. Still, I give it a 7 for first-rate imagination, acting, and a generally plausible story line.

Foreboding. The stuff of heady sci-fi. Would it deliver the kind of punch to the groin that the great cautionary tales of the past like “Colossus: The Forbin Project,” “1984,” “Metropolis,”  “The Andromeda Strain,” and “2001” mustered?\r There’s always been a kind of thoughtfulness and restraint that accompanies classic science fiction. It’s both clinical as a white lab coat — asking that you listen intently to the theories being sermonized — and stodgily respectable as a tweed-fitted professor. I’ll admit I was anxious to sign up for the lecture “Ex Machina” promised, as it dangled the fascinating subject of AI and the singularity as its subject: the stuff of Golden Age dreams and worlds of wonder.\r But, alas, as the film rolled, the podium stood empty. In place of learned professor someone had rolled up a TV monitor and tired Betamax machine, apparently supplied with the wrong cassette, paper bagged and quietly pulled from beneath a counter. As “Ex Machina”  played on, my heart sank as I realized the tale was to be less Asimov and more servo-driven de Sade. Despite occasional snippets of debate on what it means to be human, “Ex Machina’s” story is little more than damsel-with-pneumatic-limbs in distress melodrama. It’s more akin to a creaky gothic horror story than a glimpse into the future.  The transcendence of artificial intelligence and it’s implications are hardly touched upon and instead “Ex Machina” focuses on a story as hoary as any bodice ripper that’s been penned.\r A slightly mad (and hungover) genius programmer with a Net tycoon’s ten-figure-bank account (Oscar Isaac reprising his tough-kid-from-Brooklyn persona from “Inside Llewyn Davis“) has secluded himself on an impossibly large piece of real estate, a surprisingly claustrophobic piece of architecture, despite a presumed love of the great outdoors. In his private bunker, Isaac’s has created a Bluebeard’s (the name of his company is Bluebook) high-tech boudoir of female automatons that he keeps prisoner in pursuit of — presumably — the perfect companion. The young visitor who knocks innocently at the imposing door of his castle (Irish-actor Domhnall Gleeson, mimicking the boyish lilt of Matthew Modine) — like a naive traveler from a Poe tale, or soon-to-be-drained Jonathan Harker — suddenly finds himself inexplicable drawn to an eerie, yet comely young maiden (Icelandic waif Alicia Vikander), who may or may not be a prisoner. The lord of the castle has tasked this young traveler with determining if the maiden is indeed worthy of human devotion, because she is, in fact, yet another mechanical sex toy he’s cobbled together. It’s almost like the set up to a dirty joke. And there’s a cloying tawdriness that permeates the film and its story of a sweet-faced robot held prisoner by her Google-Age Doctor Frankenstein.\r Gleeson’s and Vikander’s behind-glass-walls relationship — the centerpiece of the film — is half-Times Square peep show, half speed dating, and, unfortunately, where the science fiction gets swallowed by pulp fiction. For a young programmer with an interest in logic, Gleeson seems to soon abandon his. Despite being charged with administering a test of intelligence, Gleeson fails his own miserably. Even with the knowledge that she’s more Linux than Ligeia, he lets her chipset of charms fool him into thinking what she needs is a white knight and not a hard restart.  Instead of probing the workings of Vicander’s mind, he spends most of the time talking to her like he’s in a slow dance at the high school prom. And speaking of dancing, the one of the film’s most remarked-on scenes is an impromptu, perfectly synched disco number between Isaacs and a lithe Asian android he’s put on mute. While undeniably fun, that fact that it’s about the only scene to raise”Ex Machina” out of its numbness, portends badly of the film having less of a real pulse than its heroine. Fresh ideas in are scant supply in “Ex Machina” and whether or not Garland was intentionally channeling his tale of lust for nuts and bolts from Olympia in “The Tales of Hoffman,” Maria in “Metropolis,” or the uber-sexbot Kris from “Bladerunner,” its lack of invention keeps the film badly grounded in its pseudo-grindhouse scenario.\r Garland’s locked-in-a-dungeon script, coupled with a plentiful tableaux of supple artificial flesh, eventually feels less and less like a exploration of the new millenium’s scariest possibility than a peek into a folder of inappropriate Victoriana. That’s why as I science fiction purist, I felt myself increasingly pulling away from “Ex Machina.”  About 20 minutes into the movie my hopes sank for seeing a smart little sci-fi film, when realized I wasn’t going to be treated to speculation, but titillation. The mad doctor’s growing sadism toward his dolls makes the film feel increasingly like “Fifty Shades of Grey”written for the IT department",

Nathan is completely drunk most of the time and refuses to talk about anything technical. He actually had me convinced that aliens magically gave him the technology to print AI's, because he couldn't possibly have accomplished anything like that. Seriously, the guy is a technological illiterate.\r To add on top of that, Ava, the main AI, might as well just be a regular woman who has been painted on to look like a robot. There's nothing about her that would make her an artificial intelligence or special in any sense. This also brings me back to Nathan, they just refuse to talk about how the AI works or how any of the artificial bodies are created. There's nothing. Everything just seemed to have magically popped out of nowhere.\r Caleb being the naive protagonist of the movie is something I can understand, especially because it's explained later down the line.\r And I don't even know how to feel about Nathan building a harem of **** robots for the sole purpose of having sex with.\r This movie has been a complete waste of time for me, it's dull and solely exists on the basis that those AI's came out of ****ing nowhere with everyone refusing to explain on it.",

It is a visually compelling work, and even when humans and robots are sharing the screen, never feels anything less than vibrant and vivaciously real.\r The script is provocative, though there are a few moments that fail to have impact, notably when a character wins a lottery that is so obviously rigged I don't feel the need to tag this for spoilers, but the characters act as if it's some big revelation. This is minor though, and the film's exploration of artificial intelligence is on the whole compelling. It's a lot easier to start a sci-fi film than it is to end it, and the conclusion wraps up tightly, if not with the dramatic punch I might have hoped for.\r To me, the highlight performance is Oscar Isaac, who presents the age-old ambiguity between genius and madness, and sells the story. The robot you're here to see is also an impressive achievement, both technically and dramatically. There are a few moments of action and swells of predictably electronic score, but it's ultimately a cerebral movie, one of the few of late that is truly science fiction, speculative fiction, rather than a conventional story set in space. Definitely recommended.",

There is incredibly acting from everyone in the film, but particularly Oscar Isaac, who seems to light up every film and character he inhabits.  The beautiful complex house the inventor lives in is so reactive that it becomes its own character and its own threat, as do the isolated woods and mountains that surround it.  The dialogue is tightly structured and delivered throughout, in turns hilarious and horrifying, with its precision accentuated by the occurrence of only one-on-one conversations.  The story itself is darkly engaging, becoming more tense and more frightening, and building to a series of grotesque climaxes as the film explores the consequences of building a truly sentient machine.

I'm sorry I got to get that out there.\r The story is about a programmer at an internet-search giant, wins a competition to spend a week at the private mountain estate of the company's brilliant and reclusive CEO, Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac). Upon his arrival, Caleb learns that Nathan has chosen him to be the human component in a Turing Test-charging him with evaluating the capabilities, and ultimately the consciousness, of Nathan's latest experiment in artificial intelligence.\r Every review for Ex Machina has been amazing, I haven't came across a review that gived it a negative score and everyone is calling the movie \"An original storytelling movie with a deep message about A.I\". I got pumped up for the movie because the movie looked great, it had a solid looking cast and the score for the movie was pure brilliant because I actually listened to the soundtrack to this movie before I even seen the movie. After seeing the movie I can say that Ex Machina is a smart original story that's totally different from other Sci-Fi monster films.\r Alex Garland the director of this movie, and this is pretty much my first movie that I've seen directed by him and I can say that Garland really brought a lot to this movie and that's the true real life look on A.I, I mean he did wrote the movie as well so he had full control of the movie and he can do whatever he wanted for the story and he's vision he had for the movie, because I seen Alex Garland in interviews online and he talked about how much he gived it he's all and got whatever vision he had out there, and it worked. Alex Garland directed the movie outstandingly well done as he got the tone and the realism to it that made the movie great for me.\r Alicia Vinkander who plays Ava (The robot) and Alicia did more then a great performance, she did outstanding in this movie. I believed every scene that she's in was a full life robot because she didn't do the cliche robot voice or the lifeless face and the boring body movement, no she add a lot to her character and that's Ava trying to be human and acting and also doing actives like people will do. But she's also sneaky and can easily convince you that she's a gentle soft heart that although out the movie she will fill you with lies or the truth depends what mood she's in, and Alicia Vinkander delivered a brilliant performance to this role and she knocked it out of the park.\r Oscar Isaac is also in this movie and he's also brilliant in this as well. Oscar Isaac has been impressing me recently with his acting in his past performance and in this movie he once again brings it to he's all, because he did great playing this cool lay back genius who created life and he takes it like a joke and I think that's why I liked his character a lot more then I expected. Oscar Isaac you did awesome in the movie, well done you fantastic actor.\r The movie's tone was also spot on as it kind of gives you a uncomfortable feeling inside of you as the unsolved secrets slowly start's to be unsolved. The writing was great and the cinematography was beautiful to look at.\r Now for problem: The one person I haven't brought up during this review is Domhnall Gleeson and he's not terrible in the movie, actually he was good in the movie but his character was a bit dull and flat to watch. I didn't really care about he's character that much because the movie to me didn't really development him that much to care about.\r The movie is very slow at times and I wouldn't say the movie is for everyone as I have talked to some people who have seen the movie and they pretty came out and say that they didn't like the movie. But hey you can't win everyone over even when a movie is ten times better then other most films out there but some people overlook that.\r Overall Ex Machina is a great storytelling A.I movie with a strong hidden message about people pushing technology to far over the edge that it will soon kill us and becoming us.",

Although the first hour slogs along without much happening, the final 30 revs up the narrative. The premise is interesting, the environment is attractive and the EFX are cool, but the twists are somewhat obvious. Even though it may not end where expected, in retrospect, it's comes to a realistic and upsetting conclusion. This isn't a flashy sci-fi spectacle, but a quiet and somewhat intriguing cautionary tale.",

Some scenes drag out way too long.  The dialogue isn't quite nuanced or profound enough for the headiness of its philosophy. Oscar Isaac isn't wholy convincing in his Steve Jobs-like role.  The payoff is also lukewarm and predictable.  All in all it's a little sad that for its un-hollywood-ness it gets default praise, but once we get over that \"novelty\" there is just an okay story left over.",

This story follows Caleb, who is a coder who is invited to go to his CEO's estate for a few days. The CEO, who is named Nathan, reveals that he was flown out there to be the human component in a Turing Test with an A.I named Ava. What follows are sessions with Caleb and Ava and subsequent conversations between Nathan and Caleb that eventually reaches a climax. All of the actors, including Domnhall Gleeson and Oscar Issac were awesome, however Alicia Vikander, who plays Ava, stands out among them. The only qualm I have is how the ending was executed with Ava leaving the facility. However, this doesn't detract from the film for me at least.

For years Isaac has been building this super attractive female A.I, and now he wants Domnhall to put this A.I under various tests to see if they have actually created A.I. On paper the opening act of this movie sounds completely laborious, but it still manages to compel with it's exceptionally well written dialogue which works absurdly well with acting strengths of the 3 main characters. We see from the get go how smart both Domnhall and Isaac really are. It's clear they have found a niche in intellectual dialogue, as every line was delivered as if they fully understood the subject at hand, and their personal chemistry and perplexing sense of humour is down right fascinating. Then we have Alicia Vikander, who plays the A.I. And I can already tell she's already got a long career ahead of her. The way she can be so stiff and robotic yet act purposefully to the contextual drama is beyond me, yet some how she manages to pull it off. I think this movie has kick started the career's of 3 top notch actors. However, it's really the 2nd and the 3rd act that bring this movie up. As the A.I starts reacting to tests in extremely scary ways, conflict and tension grows between the 3 protagonists. But what really brings this aspect to life, is again the superb dialogue. It's worded so cleverly that it's hard to tell any ones true meaning, even in the most simple of lines. It constantly makes you re think who you should really trust with every line spoken. One minute your trust lies in the A.I, but then with another line of dialogue it changes to Isaac, creating nail bitting levels of tension. Despite this, there is one major draw back to this movie. While the dialogue is so complex with several layers of meaning in each and every line, the overall narrative is extremely cliched and goes for the pretentious examination of humanity plot line, resulting in the 3rd act suffering. A lot. However, this is still an excellently rounded and masterfully crafted movie, and a highly recommend watch.",
