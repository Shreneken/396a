But foremost he is unable to get the respect he thinks he deserves from his inmates and the state Governor (Eric Roberts).Prison warden Bill Boss (Dieter Laser), leading a big state prison in the US of A, has a lot of problems; his prison statistically has the highest amount of prison riots, medical costs and staff turnover in the country. But foremost he is unable to get the respect he thinks he deserves from his inmates and the state Governor (Eric Roberts). He constantly fails in experimenting with different ideas for the ideal punishment to get the inmates in line, which drives him, together with the sizzling heat, completely insane. Under threats of termination by the Governor, his loyal right hand man Dwight (Laurence R Harvey) comes up with a brilliant idea. A revolutionary idea which could change the American prison system for good and save billions of dollars. An idea based on the notorious Human Centipede movies, that will literally and figuratively get the inmates on their knees, creating the ultimate punishment and deterrent for anyone considering a life of crime. Having nothing to lose, Bill and Dwight create a jaw-dropping 500-person prison centipede.… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Like it or not, Six has contributed something fresh and demented to pop culture.",
    "The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence) is just as repulsive, but far louder, and in color.",
    "Tom Six's threequel races to the bottom with abandon, all while indulging in tired wink-wink self-consciousness that includes Six himself showing up to witness his movie monster made real (and to be slandered by Laser as \"a poop-infatuated toddler\").",
    "Neither Scary nor eye-rollingly fun, The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence) is the dullest entry in an atrocious trilogy.",
    "Bad writing, shoddy effects work, and Laser’s nonstop shouting of every single line of dialogue do not add up to a transgressive statement about the American for-profit prison system, but instead achieve the dubious honor of being the most annoyingly in-your-face horror flick of the year thus far.",
    "Six just wants to shock, though his imagination is so primitive that the effort is strained and a bit pathetic. Initially abrasive, the whole enterprise grows simply tedious well before the now-epically-scaled titular phenom is unveiled in the prison yard.",
    "No. Nope. Uh-uh.",
    "A cynical, and consistently unpleasant film with creators who try very, very hard to push as many of your buttons as they can.",
    "As horror, it's frightless and boring. As comedy, it's desperate and laughless. As exploitation, it's exceedingly dull. Even excrement was once something of substance. The Human Centipede III: Final Sequence is just rancid air. It too shall pass.",
    "A caldron of unspeakable acts and unpalatable language, The Human Centipede 3 takes the bottom-feeding standards of its previous chapters (released in 2010 and 2011) to new lows of debasement.",
    "Even by the series’ already low standards, The Human Centipede Part 3 is crap.",
    "The gross-out gore scenes and poop jokes are there, too, as is to be expected. The direction is bad, the acting is worse, and it’s lit to mimic the soap-opera effect on a poorly calibrated HDTV. Basically, The Human Centipede III is an unsexy \"Ilsa\" movie, and it’s just as impossible to sit through as that sounds.",
    "It’s only fitting that a series that began with the concept of linking the digestive tracts of three people would end by feasting on its own shit.",
    "The thing that wrecks The Human Centipede III isn’t how the film is disgustingly, degradingly unclean; instead, Six’s work is ruined by how his film is desperately, depressingly unclever.",
    "Tom Six has achieved the seemingly impossible: He's made a film even less watchable than \"The Human Centipede II.\""

Human Centipede III is poorly written, poorly executed, needlessly vile, shameless, pointless, illogical, annoying, and boring. The previous two movies set the bar pretty low, but somehow this movie managed to be even worse. It seems as if the director is desperate to make the most disgusting movie ever. On some level he succeeded, but it's not really disgusting in the way that makes some horror movies enjoyable. It's just dumb, and pathetic, and laughably bad.

And II do not go into the Human Centipede films with any expectation of greatness - I watch them out of curiosity, I watch them because after every instalment, Tom Six promises that the next entry will be even more offensive than the last.  And I admit it, I'm intrigued, and so I allow myself to experience them.  After the last film, one of the most revolting pieces of cinema I've ever seen, Six stated that the sequel would make the former look like a Disney movie (or some similar analogy).  Taking that in mind, I went into The Human Centipede with the expectation that I would want to turn it off halfway through.  And that's exactly what happened, though not for the reasons I imagined.  I was bored.  Horrendously, horribly bored.  This franchise, though not exquisite film making, has at least managed to keep my attention in the past.  But throughout this sequel, I was always unsure at what exactly the film was trying to be.  Was it a comedy?  It seemed to want to be, but Dieter Laser screaming all of his lines in what I perceived to be an attempt at an American accent only made for a one-joke pony, and that joke became stale pretty damn quickly.  Indeed, the style in which Laser delivers his lines renders the film almost unwatchable.  So, not a comedy then.  A horror film?  On paper, it is body horror, but the \"centipede\" of the title doesn't appear until around fifteen minutes before the end of the film, and despite being 500 people long, is nowhere near as disturbing as the DIY-attempt by Laurence R. Harvey (who also appears here as Laser's assistant) in the previous film.  The lighting throughout the film diminishes it of any creepy atmosphere; unlike its predecessor, The Human Centipede 3 isn't in black and white, and almost, if not all of the scenes are set in the day time in a desert environment.  So not a horror film, then.  An exploitation film?  Of the genres I've mentioned, exploitation certainly comes closest.  But as I mentioned at the beginning of my review, this is some of the most boring exploitation I've ever seen.  Sure the only female in the entire movie is used by a sex object by the antagonist, sure there's a scene in which a prisoner is waterboarded with boiling water, sure there's a scene in which a man is graphically and violently castrated on screen, but in terms of making the last movie look like a Disney film?  Absolutely not; the lacklustre presentation of the titular centipede alone is enough to know that The Human Centipede 3 is nowhere near as gory and gratuitously brutal as its predecessor.  This series was never going to be a magnum opus, (at least, not according to anyone other than Tom Six), but it's a... shame? that it has to end with an entry so dull and deflated.",

Harvey banding together as a new villainous duo aspiring to connect over 500 human bodies together.\r Do any of you remember my review of The Human Centipede 2 where I said I'm not going to watch the other one just because I was that grossed out and angry at the time, and I also didn't know they were making a third movie at the time of that review. I just found out a couple of days about this movie and how it was the final which I had the thought of \"Oh god I'm going to watch no matter what I'm I\", and I sure did. I know some of you are thinking \"Matt why on earth would you watch this movie since you hated the last two movies and what are expecting from this disgusting film series\". I know I should know better and I originally had no plans on seeing this one since I still think the second movie is the worst horror movie ever made, but since I already seen and review the first and second movie I thought to myself \"Why not finish this horrible franchise of torture porn\". These no surprise this movie sucked big time but what really surprise me is how boring the movie is.\r I hate the fact that this movie is self aware of the others movies as the character's watch and talk about them and how they look like them even when it's the same actor. The other thing that really grinds my gears while watching this movie is how the character's treat the movie director Tom Six (Yes he's in this movie playing himself) like a god to film making, even when  he's not and he's just another Eli Roth clone.\r Dieter Laser makes a return in this movie and his acting in this movie is so over the top crewing up the scenery that it got to the point that it annoyed the crap out. His character in the movie is so annoying I mean oh my god although the movie he never stops yelling and he was being a total tool to everyone around him. I mean every scene this guy is on he's always screaming, knocking things over and yelling on the top of his lungs and it really got on my nerves to the point were I turned down the volume just to enjoy the silence.\r The whole movie is deep inside and out ugly just ugliness. Everybody in this movie is awful human being and how this movie treats women is unspeakably awful.\r Now Human Centipede 3 isn't as horrid or disgusting as the second movie I mean I almost throw up watching that movie. Yeah you get your graphic and gory violence in this one, but this time I didn't feel the need to throw up and take a shower every minute like the second made me do.\r Overall The Human Centipede 3 is a dull mindless Peace of sh*t gory feast that only sick in the head people would find enjoyment.",

Again, there is no real script here but a context and a cause. The context is the prison world and the cause is the madness and insanity of the guards and prison director who decide to build the \"centipede\" with hundreds of prisoners whom they think should be punished more severely.

Blood and fluids do not scare me, and I honestly do not feel like watching a movie if I suspect it's going to make me throw up my lunch. If I tried watching this movie it was just to be aware of the extent of the crap I already knew he had. I really hope it's the end of the centipedes.",

Overall it isn't extremely gory and it takes a more comedic approach (which I am not such if it is the purpose because I personally don't find the humor funny). This series gets more meta as it evolves, and in this last film it's a bit too over the top for me, it almost comes of as an ego stroke. It is not the worst garbage in the world but it is not worth your time.",

I enjoyed the previous parts, but this one had more or less nothing. The second part already spoiled the magic of the first a bit by the fact that it was only a film and it was not real, but here it deepened even more. Two had a great idea. It was interesting to watch that someone would say that they would imitate the film. But this doesn't make much sense in the third part. The biggest problem is the actors themselves. A German doctor from number one suddenly watches a film where he was and comments on it with the words that this is nonsense and who recommended it to him? Martin from the second, who is suddenly Dwight here. I do not understand. I absolutely don't understand why this film was made. The story, which was really at least here in previous films at once, is a bit more and is the worst of the whole trilogy. Quite a lot for me. As soon as you get the classic The Human Centipede, it wasn't much either. It was definitely great in length, but the main problem in my opinion was that the people in it were dressed. Previous films have at least tried to be more disgusting and disgusting. Here, what was probably the most disgusting was cutting the balls. I apologize for the smaller spoiler of what awaits you, but in my opinion it will not come out better in the film. At least the two were disgusting and I enjoyed it. I wanted to see another real perversion, but I didn't get anything more than just **** that ruined the whole series, and the two just had to end. In my opinion, this should never have happened. For me, a bad film that I do not recommend, not even to someone who is looking for a real filthy, because he will not see it here.",
