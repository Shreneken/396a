  "critic_reviews": [
    "Not only has George Miller made an effective return to the wasteland of the Mad Max universe with Mad Max: Fury Road, he has surpassed most action films released … well … ever.",
    "“Fury’s” pace is delirious, the stunts are incredible — such crashes, such explosions, such a lot of flying bodies — Hardy’s performance is a marvel of subdued conviction and Theron brings an impressive gravity to her work as Furiosa. Put it all together, and you’ve got a rousing crowd-pleaser that hits on all fast-revving cylinders.",
    "Wild and unrelenting, but also possessed of the outlandish poetry, laced with hints of humor, that rises to the surface when the world is all churned up.",
    "Mad Max: Fury Road will leave you speechless, which couldn't be more appropriate. Words are not really the point when it comes to dealing with this barn-burner of a post-apocalyptic extravaganza in which sizzling, unsettling images are the order of the day.",
    "The loveliest part of Mad Max: Fury Road is its grungy, quasi-Gothic imagery — the production was designed by Colin Gibson and photographed by John Seale. And the fullest flowering of its images can be found in its muscle cars, muscle trucks, muscle trailers and muscle buggies.",
    "Even in the most chaotic fights and collisions, everything makes sense. This is not a matter of realism — come on, now — but of imaginative discipline. And Mr. Miller demonstrates that great action filmmaking is not only a matter of physics but of ethics as well. There is cause and effect; there are choices and consequences.",
    "Mad Max: Fury Road sets new standards in old-school stunt work and car chases and does it in service of an idea-driven story with a beating heart and an action star for our troubled times in Charlize Theron.",
    "Unstoppable and righteous, it roars across the no-lane hardpan like the four-iron horseman of the kinetic apocalypse, amped up on bathtub crank and undiluted movie love. Oh, what a movie. What a lovely movie!",
    "The shock, really, is how tender Mad Max: Fury Road ultimately becomes. The film just wraps that tenderness in one of the most epic action extravaganzas of recent years. It's enough to renew your faith in movies.",
    "With Mad Max: Fury Road, director George Miller delivers the sort of jumbo-sized entertainment that makes you spontaneously break out in appreciative laughter: The breadth of his imagination and showmanship makes you giddy.",
    "If Fury Road were only interested in action, it would still be a stunning achievement, but the film has more on its mind.",
    "From its very first scenes, Fury Road vibrates with the energy of a veteran filmmaker working at the top of his game, pushing us forward without the cheap special effects or paper-thin characters that have so often defined the modern summer blockbuster.",
    "It’s all perfectly, wonderfully, fantastically crazy. Amidst all those ingenious, power-packed road warrior sequences, Fury Road contains a surprising amount of depth and character development.",
    "Strap in, load up and hang on because Mad Max: Fury Road is a freaky, ballsy, phenomenal ride.",
    "This spectacularly great reboot is surprisingly owned not by Hardy, who is fine, but by Charlize Theron.",
    "Max’s re-enfranchisement is a triumph of barking-mad imagination, jaw-dropping action, crackpot humour, and acting in the face of a hurricane.",
    "A lunatic vision, as hilarious as it is hellish. And some of the greatest action ever put on screen.",
    "Marrying the biting frenzy of Terry Gilliam’s film universe with the explosive grandeur of James Cameron, Miller cooks up some exhilaratingly sustained action. But the key to this symphony of twisted metal is how the film never forgets that violence is a sort of madness.",
    "The world of Mad Max has always been welded together from bits of whatever was lying around, and the films’ brilliance has always been in their welding – the ingenious ways in which their scrap-metal parts were combined to create something unthinkable, hilarious or obscene, and often all three.",
    "There is gargantuan excess here, to be sure — and no shortage of madness — but there is also an astonishing level of discipline.",
    "There is nothing easy or predictable about what George Miller delivers with Mad Max: Fury Road, a stone-cold action master class, beautiful and brainy and startling in the ways it throws off the current definition of the blockbuster.",
    "Where Fury Road stands apart from so much of today’s action cinema is that the human element remains front and center.",
    "It’s not often delays, financial dissolutions, and waning interest make a film better, but I don’t want to know what Mad Max: Fury Road might have been without them. In its current form the film embodies a logical escalation of what director George Miller began over three decades ago by embracing the insanity eating away at his titular road warrior’s resolve.",
    "For all the chaos erupting at all times, we never lose track of what’s going on, because it’s been staged not just with diabolical mischief, but also total clarity. What a movie.",
    "Even though this is the fourth Mad Max, and it’s indebted to the style of the previous films, Fury Road stands alone. It’s better looking and more thrilling than any of the other installments. The color palette is vibrant and beautiful, and every inch of the frame is crammed with crazy, brilliant ideas.",
    "Mad Max: Fury Road is certainly a blast and a half: You don’t just watch it, you rock out to it.",
    "The first two Max features ran barely 90 minutes and it takes guts and real confidence to dare push a straight chase film with very little dialogue to two hours. But Miller has pulled it off by coming up with innumerable new elements to keep the action compelling.",
    "Mad Max: Fury Road kicked my ass hard. It'll kick yours. So get prepped for a new action classic. You won't know what hit you.",
    "Talk about taking things to a new level… Theaters showing Fury Road should have seat belts installed.",
    "This is analog filmmaking at its most daring.",
    "Grim, gruesome and glorious.",
    "George Miller orchestrates the rubber-burning pandemonium with the illicit smirk of someone who knows he's giving us exactly what we want.",
    "Miller’s not interested in character development, plot twists or social commentary, with one possible exception.  He wanted spectacular stunts, which he achieves with tremendous skill, and a bad-guys-vs.-less-bad-guys pursuit that goes through countless exciting permutations.",
    "\"Mad Max\" doesn't just depict conflicts with evildoers in a tattered existence. It delivers a rare alternative to aggressively stupid action movies. At a time of great need, Max rides again.",
    "Come for the blistering, full-tilt action, stay for the thought-provoking consideration of the post-apocalypse.",
    "Nothing is too much, and whilst there is the danger that some will find the unremitting havoc tiresome, Miller's endless innovation keeps things fresh despite the surrounding wasteland.",
    "It is insane. In a good way. Whoever said \"Too much is never enough\" made an impression on Miller, who uses the phrase as a starting point and blasts off from there.",
    "The majority of Fury Road’s effects were done without using CGI, but even so, the onslaught of action is so fast-paced and overpowering there’s little time to appreciate Miller’s analog artistry, and the feeling of being inside a video game—a sinking sensation familiar from less carefully orchestrated action movies—sometimes takes over.",
    "That adjective in the title is accurate. Extravagantly deranged, ear-splittingly cacophonous, and entirely over the top, George Miller has revived his Mad Max punk-western franchise as a bizarre convoy chase action-thriller in the post-apocalyptic desert.",
    "Those pole riders swaying high above the action - hired from Cirque du Soleil, don't you know - there to help make \"Fury Road\" a gorgeous, scrap metal demolition derby of a popcorn picture.",
    "Its true subject is the thrill of the chase and the means by which the movies express it, which is to say it’s one hell of a ride in the same direction taken by the characters: deep into a desert of vast and horizonless emptiness.",
    "George Miller's Fury Road is a hundred things at once: a biker movie, a spaghetti western, a post-apocalyptic dystopian action pic, a tale of female empowerment (The Vagina Monologues' Eve Ensler was a consultant on set), a Bosch painting made scary 3D real, a Keystone Kops screwball romp, and an auto show from hell.",
    "To say that there is also a monomania to the film is, if anything, an understatement. But it is precisely that sense of tunnel vision that makes Fury Road such a pulse-pounding pleasure.",
    "When the original filmmaker upgrades and expands on an idea and uses new technology while retaining the essence of the original story, it can be just the ticket for jaded moviegoers. Such is the case with Mad Max: Fury Road, an operatic extravaganza of thrilling action and nearly non-stop mayhem.",
    "Mad Max: Fury Road is a relentless marvel of sense-pummeling stunts and gargoyle horror that needs to take a breather once in a while.",
    "The creator of the original \"Mad Max\" trilogy has whipped up a gargantuan grunge symphony of vehicular mayhem that makes \"Furious 7\" look like \"Curious George.\"",
    "When you get past Miller’s orgy of loco action sequences—and they’re so good, you may not need to—the story is pretty thin.",
    "For all the ways the movie feels singular and impossible, like something the studio suits couldn't possibly have signed off on, Fury Road also feels entirely of its era. I admire its craft and cruel wit, and its willingness to trust us to work out the particulars of its world, but it lulled me into that familiar state of summertime action fatigue, of being worn down by the violence rather than geared up, of waiting the mayhem out rather than tracking it.",
    "For a while, Fury Road’s complete disinterest in screenwriting fundamentals feels liberating, as the director keeps upping the ante on this desperate chase through the desert. But what feels liberating at first can become monotonous, and Fury Road starts to drag once the frenetic sameness of Miller’s strategy takes hold.",
    "The action sequences, at least as feats of engineering, are mightily impressive. But Miller is so caught up in all his hardcore allegorical hoo-ha that he never lightens up. Does he think maybe he’s Homer?",
    "Yet all this wit and effort and occasional beauty is in the service of a movie that is little more than a two-hour chase scene, one that seems founded on the assumption that if you show one set of people chasing another, that’s enough to get an audience excited: Oh, no, let’s hope they don’t get caught!"

I wasn't able to sit back at all during the movie, the constant action and twists had me either on the edge of my seat or jumping up and down with my brother screaming. The only thing I feel could have been improved upon was diving more into the past of Max himself, he is one of the most iconic characters ever for many Action movie fans and yet, in a movie made to continue his Glory, he was explained very little. Those who know of his past of course understood some of the finer points in the film. All in all, I truly enjoyed my experience and I will definitely be buying it upon release. 9 out of 10.",

Honestly I was a bit worried when I first sat in the cinema to watch this movie because I was unsure if the movie will live up to my expectation based on what I'd seen on the trailer or not. This is because most of the movies I watched previously only appears really interesting in the trailer but not in real premiere. However, this one totally blew me off. It is super duper cool and worth it! I haven't watched previous Mad Max series and when I heard that since this is going to be a sequel to past Mad Max series, I thought I wouldn't understand the plot but it turns out there's not much to understand anyway. The plot is straightforward although there are some parts which leaves me into question but I guess I might need to refer that to past series. Anyway to be honest the plot is just normal to me but I do give top marks for the action of this movie. I mean this is literally a full action movie. Right from the beginning to the end there's always action scenes which leaves the audience in awe and I think with this kind of movie, the plot don't mind that much to me. This movie is like the apocalypse version of Fast and Furious and for gamers who have played apocalyptic games, this reminds me a lot about games such as Rage or Twisted Metal. I would love to see another sequel to this!",

The film retains the gritty tone of the original films, but with updated effects and choreography that is mind-blowing. \"Pulse-pounding\" and \"edge of your seat action\" are terms that get thrown around a lot in reviews of films like this one, but they are completely appropriate here. Almost the entirety of the movie is spent on one \"war rig\", but there is a certain level of twisted beauty in the simplicity of it all. The vehicles are fascinating beasts of twisted metal and gasoline. The characters are hopeless, yet determined. The world itself is barren, hot, and unforgiving. This all sets the tone perfectly as you watch the protagonists struggle through it all in a series of brilliantly designed chases, brutal battles, and bloody deaths. Hardy was well cast as the titular Mad Max, grunting and fighting while uttering few words. Nicholas Hoult is unrecognizable as Nux, one of Immortan Joe's (the main villain of the film) \"War Boys\". When he's on-screen, he definitely stands out and Hoult is becoming quite the character actor. The real star of the film, however, was Charlize Theron. If anyone ever wondered if she could pull off an action film, wonder no longer. She not only pulls it off, but excels. Entertaining from start to finish, Mad Max: Fury Road is already in the running for best film of 2015.\r The Bad: Not that it matters TOO much, but the plot is not only paper thin, but mostly non-existent. It's a small detail, but prevents the film from being absolutely perfect. Aside from that, some of \"the Wives\", who are a plot device that helps drive the film, were somewhat annoying and uninteresting.",

But here's my attempt.\r With technical precision that seems effortlessOh, man. I don't have words for this film yet. Maybe there are no words, since what George Miller and his team put onscreen defies description and transcends language. But here's my attempt.\r With technical precision that seems effortless but must surely have taken a small army to manage, Miller weaves his unique, fantastic vision of post-apocalyptic chaos and carnage into a work of piston-pumping poetry, all set to Junkie XL's adrenaline-fueled soundtrack. Without hyperbole, I can say right now that this one of the all-time great action movies. It makes Furious 7 look like a badly edited Mario Kart replay.\r I'm not gonna lie, there was a moment of vehicular mayhem where I shed a manly tear. T'was one of hope, for my heart had almost forgotten what heights pure cinema was capable of. It's got a minimum of CGI, fantastic stunt work, great set design and art direction, breathtaking locations, and strong performances, even from the supporting cast. This is the movie I've been waiting for my whole life, ever since I smashed little Matchbox vehicles against one another as a child and made comics about sentient cars.\r There's no prior franchise experience necessary. If you're a connoisseur of action films, you miiiight want to try being in the best theater you can find this weekend. I just can't wait to see it again and am gonna do so as soon as possible.\r As far as performances, Tom Hardy makes a fine Max, Charlize Theron's Furiosa is up there with Ripley as one of the most badass women in sci-fi, and Nicholas Hoult's Nux is very entertaining. The dude who plays Immortan Joe (he was in the first Mad Max, too) is just perfect, the kind of larger-than-life big boss whom you can imagine inspiring lifelong devotion. Whether or not the story boasts a \"feminist agenda\" in having a number of strong female characters is up to the eye of the beholder, but it didn't bother this cis, straight man. If you want my real opinion, I think the gender-war-fueled backlash is all hyperbole designed to sell more tickets, and anyone offended enough to not want to see THE FIRST MAD MAX FILM IN 30 YEARS probably needs to have their man card snapped in half.\r I really want to congratulate everyone involved in the production of this film. I don't even mind if this ends up being the last great action film, but wouldn't it be grand if this was really just the start of a new breed of action films? I'm really, really hoping that Miller gets a chance to make the sequels that he already has scripts and storyboards for. Tom Hardy is apparently signed on for another three films. I say BRING 'EM ON! Valhalla awaits!!",

Puts the Fast and Furious movies to complete shame. And I enjoyed the original too. It’s an entertaining series, and we’ve got some worthy new lead actors to carry the story forward. Kudos to the production.\rHowever, I’m shooting for the tires of all those “10” ratings out there.\rFirst, the movie is essentially a car (truck) chase, which makes it difficult to give dynamic range to the drama – it’s always on pretty loud.\rSecond, the performances are good given this context, but hardly stand as masterpieces of character acting.\rThird, let’s keep our powder dry and acknowledge that 8 or 9 is a worthy score for this movie. If you give Fury Road a 10, what does Raging Bull, or The Godfather Part II, or, if you want to stick to sci-fi, Inception or The Terminator, deserve? Or, if you want a bizarre, violent chase out of the Western genre, what does The Good, The Bad and The Ugly get, if this is a 10?\rFourth, the action-heavy and dialogue-light nature of this genre – and this is a genre film – leaves you with few memorable lines. Without that, it is harder to have memorable scenes. How do we build a shared shorthand around this “classic”? Do we use phrases like “the scene where he got the mask off his face” or “when Max gave her the gun because she was the better shot”? It is not impossible, but it is difficult.\rSo, go to this movie and enjoy its entertainment value, but let’s not elevate too many comics to classics.",

The movie is an absolute must-see - let's get that out of the way from the top. For me, it's probably the best, most artistic action film since the original Matrix. Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is clearly the best heroine since Ripley in the Alien films. Going in, I figured the action would be fatiguing, and the desert backdrop would get samey after a while, but I couldn't have been more wrong on both counts. Miller's inventiveness knows know bounds. If I had to point to a slightly weak link in the chain, it would be the Immortan Joe character. No doubt, he's fun to look at and provides some of the comedy, but as a character, he is not nearly as personally threatening as the chief baddies in the original Mad Max and Road Warrior flicks.  But the supreme creativity and the acrobatics in the driving sequences are so over-the-top phenomenal, you'll be conscious of the silly grin on your face when things finally let up and you allow yourself to exhale.",

This outing borders on cartoonish, and isn't brutal in any way. Where we are supposed to feel fear, and stress at the mass of pursuit vehicles, all i kept thinking was, \"Where do they get all the headlights?\", or \"for an apocalyptic wasteland, they seem to have no lack of tires or car parts\".

In 1, I knew why he was in the situation he was in and I knew why he did what he did, even while I wanted him to be better. In 2, I cared about the other people in the settlement and I wanted them to understand that Max was a good guy deep down and wanted them to accept him. I cared about Max's dog and what happened to him more than I cared about any human character at all in this new movie.\r Yes, the movie looked incredible, but all it did was take a bunch of undeniably incredible set pieces and then flap about looking for a plot to string them together. This was like a two hour trailer for a movie I felt I WOULD like to watch, because in the actual movie there would have been something to make me care one jot for the people in it. And I just didn't.",

Yet they are somehow able to build and maintain various cars able to produce agriculture, make elaborate costumes, manipulate and control it's citizens and be organized enough to create a functioning society with working technology. I won't even mention how the way blood is transfused in this is impossible and wouldn't really work. Also the environment and costumes in this movie makes no sense what there is no resources left but you can make all of these elaborate costumes and machines. There were scenes in this movie where I literally had to stop myself from laughing like the breastfeeding scenes with plastic tubes and then cut to a midget in a highchair with a telescope. But to be honest the only reason anyone likes this film is because of the action which to be fair is really good but there is only so much bad one dimensional characters and silly character design I can handle before something is too stupid too watch.",

I'm still waiting for a story to begin. I like simple, entertaining action movies (Shogun Assassin, any late 70's zombie movie, The Warriors), but this was a gratuitously long music video for a clown playing one guitar chord.\r Within the first 3 minutes I kept asking myself \"Why is this artificially sped up?\" My hunch was that the old movies (which I haven't seen) did that. Later research confirmed this. This was probably a cool effect back in the 70s, but in the post-Transformers world of barely-coherent editing in action sequences, it just makes things so much worse.\r Other than Max, each character's name is uttered maybe once, amidst screaming and car crashing, so I didn't know anyone's name until I looked it up later.\r Almost all of the eleven lines in this movie are delivered with the melodramatic heft of a Spanish soap opera. I laughed at most of them. No one else in the theater did, which alarmed me. I think I counted 20 words from Max's mouth. His brow is furrowed the entire time.\r This movie is described as \"ultra-violent\", yet if you take out 3 or 4 of the shots with blood, it's mostly pale dudes bouncing off of cars for 2 hours. It's more like a live-action Looney Tunes flick. Could have definitely gotten a PG-13 if desired, but that probably wouldn't have been edgy enough.\r Seriously, just a few scenes of dialogue could have established the world, and the problems, but the opening narration is just \"i am max. i run and stuff.\" I've dropped into other franchises with sequels first and never felt like I was missing a wealth of knowledge and unable to understand their world. Mad Max's world makes no sense to me, which again, is fine and a decision on behalf of the creators. But you need to give me SOME reason why characters are making the inane decisions that they do, otherwise everyone comes across as purely stupid.\r I fell asleep during the last 20 minutes, so I'm not sure how it ended and I don't really care.\r The effects are quite good (minus the fast-forward effect), and some of the set pieces are really cool. I dug the intro action sequence (though it basically never ends). The music is literally one symphonic swell with a palm-muted guitar chord over it.",

I have heard and read a lot about Mr. Hardy in the past couple of years but I think I have only seen him in two movies those being “Inception” and “Dark Knight Rises” but I have no recollection of him in either. The camera gives him a lot of close ups in this film so I am sure I will recognize him in future films.\r Getting an equal amount of  face time, if not a little more, and the only reason I went to see this film is Charlize Theron, who plays Imperator Furiosa, looks great even with a dirty face, raccoon eye makeup, short cropped black hair and a mechanical left hand and is the equal, if not better, than any man hero! Her eyes are a movie, without CGI effects, on their own.\r The first five minutes of “Mad Max: Fury Road” are quiet and then the incessant loud music, the races, car chases, one action scene after another begin to wear the audience down. Within a 2 hour movie there might be 15 minutes total without mayhem in every form possible. It reached a point that I was wondering how many scenes were done in front of a green screen, how many were fake, how many were performed by stunt people all the while that long music ruled by drums fills the auditorium. There is one remarkable scene of just Hardy raising up from the desert sand that made me think “WOW”!\r With a huge cast the standouts are Theron, Nathan Jones, Nicholas Hoult, the 5 wives, especially Riley Keough and trust me, you won’t want to meet any of the female sexagenarians in a dark alley or the desert!\r The direction by George Miller offers every action fans dreams while the screenplay by Miller,  Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris is simple. It is said Miller already has the next Mad Max film prepped named Furiosa and, if true, I hope it brings back Theron.\r After “The Avengers” last week and this week “mad Max” I can honestly say I have had my fill of ‘summer blockbusters.’",

Especially if the action is repetitive (pale guys jumping on and off a truck). Sometimes you can guess the movie was filmed at a very low speed and was later accelerated in the montage, like when the cars flip over.\rThe wives don't fit in the picture, apparently they just wanted to add some spice to the movie. It gets funny when they attempt to act. Of course, one of the wives is pregnant and her belly starts to hurt at a quite unpleasant time, sad coincidence.\rYou come out of the theater asking yourself what the hell you just spent 2 hours looking at. Definitely not a masterpiece, even if all critics around the world seem to think otherwise. It's in fact so bad that i signed up to metacritic just to write a honest review about how bad it was.\rApparently if you write a random hyperbole about a oil-monarchy and how unfair it is to its peasants with some totally random heros fighting it, you are guaranteed of success. It's so deep because I can relate it easily to the world i live in without having to think too much. Masterpiece.

Mad Max: Fury Road not only excels as an action movie but as an allegorical tale set in a post-apocalyptical world. The movie doesn’t have a consistent frame rate, some scenes are sped up, and others slowed down to make the film’s stakes and intensity escalate. Traditionally, I dislike when the framerate is messed with, especially when it involves being slowed down. However, with Mad Max: Fury Road it is integrated so well and so thoughtfully that it is hard to notice without intentionally looking for it. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron give excellent performances. Hardy is especially good in his portrayal of the eponymous character. Mad Max: Fury Road portrays the struggles for dominance in ideologies and liquid possession (blood, water, milk). The cinematography and stunts were gritty while still being a visual spectacle. So much of what was shown in the film was built or shot practically, giving the film an air of authenticity that couldn’t be achieved, even remotely, any other way. Altogether, Mad Max: Fury Road is a thrilling faced-paced frenzy of a movie that is constantly raising its ever-high stakes. Even after the credits roll, the adrenaline is still pumping.",

It's action packed, beautifully directed in every way, and brings in an unexpected amount of thought-provoking narrative heft. The only notable flaw is the inconsistent tone that switches quickly between bombastic absurdity and somber seriousness, weakening the strength of the film's sweet underlying message.Story: 8.5Acting: 10Script: 9.5Visuals/Sound: 9.5Entertainment Value: 9.5MY RATING: 9.4/10",

This is the fourth installment in the Mad Max franchise. As we navigate the apocalyptic wastelands of Australia we are guided by Max as he tries to survive by teaming up with a fierce woman named Furiosa. The action starts immediately and doesn’t let up. The film paces itself perfectly you never feel a scene is dragged out. With a complimenting score that combines classical orchestra with synth wave music adding to the action and intensity of each scene. The impressive stunts will leave you speechless as stunt men vault from vehicles during a high-speed pursuit. The costume design is noteworthy, as each actor is transformed into an apocalyptic survivor that is almost unrecognizable. Combined with marvelous acting by Tom Hardy (Max), Charlize Theron (Furiosa), and Nicholas Hoult (Nux) gives the movie Mad Max Fury Road is not just the best film in the franchise but one of the best action movies to date.",

This movies **** baller, im sure you can find some poetic meaning in here. Like a princesses love for a dying sickly cancer written teenage child. Or that Max's only instinct \"survive\" is succumbed to love. The action though. The action is where this movie is a feat. Its artistically a masterpiece. The staging of the action is thought out. The pacing. The suspense. The love devices make you care enough. The Survive device makes you feel cool enough. The action device makes you feel alive. Must watch. I am a fan of art. And this is simply not just cars exploding and max grunting. Its art. Which mostly involves said two former's. But beautifully and thoughtfully crafted for our enjoyment. Nothing more than that. It wants us to enjoy it. And all pieces of the film fit together to match only that belief. Does the audience enjoy it. Isnt that the point of a film?",

Within this world exist two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order. There's Max, a man of action and a man of few words, who seeks peace of mind following the loss of his wife and child in the aftermath of the chaos. And Furiosa, a woman of action and a woman who believes her path to survival may be achieved if she can make it across the desert back to her childhood homeland.",

The plot of Fury Road is pretty simple and, as some of the negative reviews have pointed out, much of the movie amounts to a series of car chases. Fortunately these car chases are absolutely spectacular and feature some of the most incredible stunt work you'll ever see and I was entertained from start to finish.
