  "critic_reviews": [
    "Sicario works on every level. It’s also fairly prescient, coming at a time when America rages on about the ethics of border control and the mounting war on drugs.",
    "Pulled from the news but punched up to fever pitch, Sicario represents the perfect mix of cerebral and visceral thrills. Star, director and screenwriter all bring their A-game.",
    "Sicario is a tentacled drug cartel thriller grabbing viewers by the throat and squeezing for two hours. This movie continually defies the conventions of its genre, from its hero's gender to the vagueness of its morality.",
    "A beautifully murky, hard-edged thriller. Quite simply, one of the best films of the year.",
    "It’s an unusual mix of big-picture issues, grindhouse pulp and pure, rough entertainment, bolstered by one of the better ensemble casts of the year. This movie is not, um, fussing around.",
    "It’s an uncommonly bold gambit, expressly designed to frustrate people who want to see a strong woman deliver a righteous ass kicking. The progressivism here is instead rooted in futility and despair, which provides much more of a valuable shock to the system.",
    "With a taut and timely screenplay by Taylor Sheridan, Sicario is a brilliant action thriller with the smarts of a message movie.",
    "The opening of Sicario unfolds at such an anxiety-inducing pitch that it seems impossible for Villeneuve to sustain it, let alone build on it, but somehow he manages to do just that. He’s a master of the kind of creeping tension that coils around the audience like a snake suffocating its prey.",
    "The violence of the inter-American drug trade has served as the backdrop for any number of films for more than three decades, but few have been as powerful and superbly made as Sicario.",
    "The violence is shocking, effective and soaked into the dry brown landscape.",
    "By turns thrilling, disorienting and draining, Sicario exists in a border zone seemingly of its own devising between the art film and the action movie.",
    "What keeps Sicario from cynicism is the nature and depth of Villeneuve’s gaze, not childishly wide-eyed but capable still of feeling pain. He’s a terrific director. You know that if his heroine, Alice, gets out of Cartel-land alive, she might spend a few months in an asylum, but she’ll be back, hell-bent on seizing the foreground.",
    "Sicario is an ambush, a low-slung  film about a dirty drugs war with Mexico which challenges and engages in equal measure. It moves with grim tenacity, confounding expectations until its very final sequence.",
    "Far from being just another crime story, Sicario is cinema at its most ambitious.",
    "Sicario is a conventionally unconventional drug wars thriller, a well-cast, breathlessly executed peek into the heart of a Trumpian nightmare of Mexican cartels which kill at will on either side of an embattled border.",
    "So much of Sicario, Denis Villeneuve’s disturbing drama set in the world of law enforcement and Mexican drug cartels (the title is the Mexican term for a hit man), takes place on Emily Blunt’s face.",
    "Those who go to a Villeneuve production, Sicario included, must be prepared for intense suspense, moral ambiguity, and an ending that doesn't conform to Hollywood norms.",
    "The sound never loses its urgency, its sense of immediate danger, straight through to the closing shot of the film.",
    "Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies) once again proves he can craft a gripping tale that never collapses under its own moral weight. Sicario is not an easy film to watch, but it is a riveting and essential one.",
    "Sicario, which combines dizzying action scenes with a taut script, ravishing photography and an otherwordly musical score, is a knockout.",
    "In Spanish, \"sicario\" means \"hitman.\" In film terms, Sicario is sensational, the most gripping and tension-packed spin through America's covert War on Drugs since Steven Soderbergh's Traffic 15 years ago.",
    "Sicario calls to mind the films of the 1970s — not necessarily the ones we think of as capital-I Important, but the seamy, sweaty thrillers that subtly slipped in anti-establishmentarian messages amid the violence. It mixes arthouse and grindhouse into a most satisfying cocktail.",
    "Sicario starts and ends with Blunt’s impassioned performance (and she's spectacular in her final scene), but it’s Del Toro who is the real standout.",
    "Even at its most comprehensible, there’s a lot Sicario deliberately leaves unsaid, and it builds to a crescendo of mayhem and moral rot worthy of a great film noir.",
    "The acting, craft, and tone of Sicario are so precise that the absurdity of this cartel yarn is both its greatest weakness, and maybe its entire point.",
    "There are no winners here. Maybe that’s cynical, or maybe it’s true. But it’s a bleak and sometimes powerful message that Villeneuve delivers with blunt force.",
    "Rather than a birds’-eye procedural about a complex international mission, it’s a close-up of that mission from the point of view of the participant who understands it the least.",
    "This dramatic thriller finds a spot somewhere between your brain and your stomach, and drills in.",
    "Sicario is a queasy-making thrill ride through Dick Cheney’s Theme Park on the Dark Side, with an enjoyable cast headed by Blunt, Josh Brolin as a bro-tastic but oddly sinister secret agent in flip-flops and Benicio Del Toro as a person of uncertain provenance (is he Mexican? Is he Colombian? Is he CIA?) who is approximately the scariest guy ever.",
    "If Sicario does not collapse under its own grimness, that is because of the pulse: the care with which Villeneuve keeps the story beating, like a drum, as he steadies himself for the next set piece.",
    "Each set piece is orchestrated with aplomb - a raid on a tunnel under the border being a particular stand out - but Sicario is kept grounded in reality. Villeneuve keeps his focus tight on his small group of characters and though the plot is complex, it fits the Byzantine intricacies of the problem and the obscure motivations of the operators.",
    "Blunt’s performance has an edge of steel. She brings off a mix of confidence, bewilderment and vulnerability, which functions very well against the alpha male characters higher up the chain of command.",
    "Sicario is at its best when its borderlines are fluid and indistinct.",
    "It delivers a constant, exhilarating stream of elaborate and exquisitely photographed thrills that ends up largely compensating for the would-be profundity.",
    "I'm not sure if leavening is the right word, but Brolin, as an enigmatic U.S. agent with a world-weary cynicism and a black-ops vibe, provides at least a dose of (very) dark humor to the proceedings.",
    "If at any point in Sicario, you feel lost, don’t worry about it. The movie is all about being lost and, in any case, all becomes clear, eventually.",
    "Every scene of calm, potentially, is trip-wired for an explosion. But for all its chilling tension and horrific imagery, Sicario is also a beautiful movie.",
    "Sicario doesn't fall apart in its second half, exactly, but it does settle for less than it should.",
    "At times, Sicario is a deeply satisfying, intense examination of a war with no rules of engagement, driven by a spectacular performance by Benicio Del Toro and typically mesmerizing cinematography from Roger Deakins. At other times, especially in its middle act, Sicario can be frustratingly self-indulgent.",
    "Denis Villeneuve's film views life in the age of the modern-day drug war as an ever-crescendoing existential nightmare.",
    "Amazing to look at, amazing to listen to, yet just a bit underwhelming to really think about, Sicario Denis Villeneuve's Mexican drug cartel drama is superlatively strong in every conceivable way except story.",
    "Though Villeneuve magnifies the pervasive dread surrounding the modern drug war, he's better at conveying the thrill of creeping through that battlefield than the complex set of interests sustaining it.",
    "Making a film with fine performances, adept direction, first-rate photography and a doltish screenplay is like starting a rock band with no drummer. The result may yield satisfying, even memorable moments. But every time you try to build momentum, the project falls apart.",
    "The dark nihilism of Sicario masks a reliance on easier solutions, ones we’ve been fed by decades of genre films and that feed our need for justice dispensed with violent, vengeful directness. The movie promises to clear the fetid air around the drug wars. In the end it’s just another drug.",
    "Sicario occasionally seems a little too impressed by its own nihilism. Still, this is an involving, grown-up film from a director whose muscular technique continues to impress: one might call it pulp in the same manner one would a plate of minced meat.",
    "Mr. Villeneuve, aided by Taylor Sheridan’s lean script, Roger Deakins’s parched cinematography and Johann Johannsson’s slow-moving heart attack of a score, respects the imperatives of genre while trying to avoid the usual clichés. It’s not easy, and he doesn’t entirely succeed.",
    "Villeneuve's proven he's got a strong punch. The trouble is, he barely aims.",
    "There’s not much fault to find with Sicario on the level of craft or performances, just its rather sputtering momentum, and the lack of a higher purpose."

However I can't get past how poorly written the main character is, (Emily Blunt) or her partner. There's something missing when they get the short end of the stick in the story. Almost feels like several key scenes were cut that would've given Blunt's character more of an active role in everything. Whatever the reason for the oversight, it's still an action packed movie worth watching, just not best film of the year.",

Blunt, sold early inKeeps interest with gritty visuals and interesting characters, but Emily Blunt is completely miscast as the hand-picked local law enforcement to assist in a larger drug operation that plays fast and loose with the law.  Blunt, sold early in the film as a tough-but-moral cop (and her toughness is a hard sell, indeed) makes one bumbling, naive move after another as the chaos of the drug war is revealed to her.  From a plot perspective, ultimately her roll in the drug operation really doesn't make much sense, and it doesn't take much thought to imagine a ton of other FBI better suited to the overarching goals.  Vague, I know, but I can't say more unless you want spoilers.Setting aside Blunt, a side story of a Mexican State police officer who smuggles drugs never really goes anywhere save to humanize some of the low-level traffickers \"just trying to put food on the table\".  Of course he loves his son.  Of course his wife is worried and prays at dinner.  Of course his son plays soccer.  Lastly, if you like films with military operations, tactics and so on, this isn't your film.  Literally in the first couple minutes, Blunt is on an FBI operation to bust a drug house in full body armor, assault weapons and a troop carrier.  As they're searching the house yelling tactical stuff like \"room clear!\", Blunt walks into a room without looking(!!), and the cliche bad guy with a shotgun is of course standing right out in the open, and of course is going to shoot it out despite dozens of agents swarming the building.  He manages to miss from five feet away, but ol' quick draw Emily Blunt spins and pumps him full of lead.  He falls to the ground still clutching the shotgun, and Blunt walks right up to him, doesn't neutralize his weapon and then checks his pulse.  For a film trying to do gritty realism, it doesn't fly.",

It seemed that all of the main actors were on the same page as far as the movie should go. And portrayed their roles perfectly. All of the actors worked together like a well made Swiss watch. Denis Villenueve masterfully managed to capture the intensity and suspense of this mesmerizing thriller. The director cemented his name as one of the best if not the best thriller masters in Hollywood today.  I would rate it 18/20\rCinematography - Was really impressive, and manages to capture the audience from the first shot of the movie and never let go of the viewer. The lightning seems bleak, but that just adds to suspense of the movie. There were a lot of impressive shots, including the very well made aerial shots of the USA - Mexican border.  I would rate it 17/20\rWriting - A movie is as good as it's script. Well in this case it's marvelous. The movie delivers everything it promises and more. It manages to deliver the thrills and sense of intensity from the start. All through out the movie, viewers are encouraged to question every single character, because the line of good and bad in this movie is very thin.  20/20\rScore - The composer Johann Johannson manages to do a very good job. Score is done to perfection. Every bit of sound seems to fit the frames perfectly and just helps to add the thrills.    I would rate it 18/20\rActing - A give a very big A plus for all the actors in this movie. Like i mentioned before, everyone fitter the role pretty much perfectly with good casting. All of the actors performed very well, so it is very difficult to mention some in particular. It seemed like every actor added something personal to the role, that made them very memorable. The chemistry between actors was something special, every relationship between characters was really intensifying, and mesmerizing.    I would rate it 20/20\rNow for the MVP of the movie is: Jon Bernthal, who truly might have slipped under the radar. But his performance was both memorable and amazing. Even though he didn't have very much of a screen time, what he did with what he got, was really masterful. He deliver a bad cop, who does not give a bad impression and hides under a mask. His character is like a wolf, disguised himself as a sheep.\rIn Total i would rate this movie - 95/100. One of the best thrillers ever made, and one of the best last years movies.",

Josh Brolin portrayed well a confident, laid back \"Matt\", and Benicio Del Toro was convincingly menacing as \"Alejandro\" aka Sicario, however, Emily Blunt made for a poor \"Kate\". I'm not blaming her, she's a great actress, I'm just saying she was wrong for the role and that took away points from the film because she was more distracting than immersed. The final few scenes of the film were so anti-climatic, too, with \"Kate\" pointing her gun at \"Alejandro\" yet again when she was warned not to, and the final soccer field scene. I understand what the director was attempting but it didn't measure up to the prior events. Really needs a more worthy ending if/when someone remakes it.",

      "content": "Scorching with the dry and arid heat of the desert land, an aerial view of Phoenix, Arizona fills the opening screen of French Canadian director Denis Villenueve’s newest feature Sicario. Sweaty, pulsating with uncanny tension and trumpetingScorching with the dry and arid heat of the desert land, an aerial view of Phoenix, Arizona fills the opening screen of French Canadian director Denis Villenueve’s newest feature Sicario. Sweaty, pulsating with uncanny tension and trumpeting with constant uncertainty, it seems that the land in which Sicario is based on is inhabited solely by the ravenous animals of the desert; and no, it isn’t referring to the four-legged desert beasts hungry for blood.\r Premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier in the season, Villeneuve’s newest film seems to touch upon a current trend plaguing all new outlets, artistic commentaries and current events; immigration, and not just at a national level, but from a very large and vast international one.\r Sicario takes places in the rural desert areas of Arizona and Mexico, setting the tone for a very corrupt and dangerous world where Mexican cartels rule the land, and the sounds of gunshots are as frequent as the cries of wolves. Drug cartels keep citizens in fear, police are as corrupt as the cartels themselves, and the efforts of the United States and their universal judiciary right for “peace” is as subtle as the low-efficiency Black SUV’s snaking their way through the hot highway pavements. With the high exposure of Trump’s high-attention media-driven campaign, as well as age-old conflicts between land, boarders and people in other areas of the world, the issues of immigration are as universal as the numeric system, which makes Villeneuve a perfect candidate to direct a wrought, unbiased and highly effective piece of fiction and reality.\r Yet, with all its high-profile media attention and concurrent position in all the headlines, Sicario doesn’t soar to its conventional storyline of corruption and intrigue of mystery for loyalties and alliances; the film itself exceeds due to its honest portrayal of people playing people, dealing in real ways with the abundance of injustice and violence.\r The spearhead of these real people is highlighted by the impeccable performance from Emily Blunt. Blunt, who trades in glam for grit, plays Kate Macer, an idealistic Special Weapons and Tactical Team agent who believes in justice and the greater good. During a routine kidnapping raid, Macer and her trusty partner, Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya), encounter a total of forty-two corpses hidden within the walls of the abandoned home, as well as an explosive device that detonates, killing two officers, and wounding Kate and Reggie. With the aftermath of the explosion behind them, Kate is offered a position working for the CIA and Department of Defence, lead by the egotistical and reckless Matt Graver (Josh Brolin). Using brute force and unconventional and highly illegal methods of dismantling the Mexican drug cartel, the special unit, paired with the help of a very mysterious and highly intimidating Alejandro (Benecio Del Toro), break the rules of law in order to get their men.\r Sicario is an uncomfortable film, in every sense of the word. Recommending the film would be a hard sell. If it wasn’t for the always spectacular Del Toro, who chimes in an Oscar worthy supporting performance that requires very little dialogue, but masterful minimalist acting, the film itself isn’t the most commercial in theatres. The intensity of the film stays true to the very blurred lines of federal justice while crossing State lines; constantly being under strict surveillance. Although the characters seem to be always out of their own jurisdiction, Kate seems to be the teams only voice of reason. It becomes quite clear early on, that everyone else in the ops are crossing the rules of the terrain, forcing Kate to bend her very strong and unwavering moral conscious. What might appear to be a very annoying character trait, in reality becomes a selling feature as Kate’s ability to humanize the very barbaric people around her is something audiences admire, not begrudge.\r Much like the memorable performance from Del Toro’s Alejandro, Sicario embodies the characteristics of the most memorable strong, silent type characters in cinema. Without over-stimulating the senses in the way Hollywood knows how to, Sicario never lets up its aggressive demeanour, despite its scarcity. Thanks to the wonderful work of Jòhann Jòhannsson (Prisoners, The Theory of Everything, Foxcatcher), who sets an unsettling score with natural sounds of harmful creatures (buzzing of bees, howling of wolves), the film’s score paces the very slow moving material at a very heavy and fluid pace. Matched with the wonderful cinematography of master Roger Deakins, the confident and tremendous direction of Villeneuve, and phenomenal transformation of Blunt as Kate, Sicario is one of the most, if not most, complete films of 2015, in all regards, cinematically speaking.\r Visually, the film is a diamond in the rough.",

The truth is, it may be impossible to fight horrendous criminals like the cartels when your hands are bound by rule of law, but does this justify the things we see? This is what films should do - make us think, question, discuss. And Sicario does an excellent job of that.\r I think a lot of people dislike how helpless the protagonist (Kate) is, but to me it just adds realism. There are so many situations in real life where the \"good guys\" are simply powerless to do anything.\r My only criticism is that the film was a bit predictable - it was pretty obvious that nothing would happen to Kate, and unlikely that anything would happen to Alejandro.",

Emily Blunt's character wasn't so necessary, she had no goal but just going with the waves of this movie, but with her amazing performance, she convinced me -or I pretended being convinced- that her goal is cleaning the world of it's dark crimes, but for me, it's uneven.Some scenes were so confusing, and there was nothing to give any hope, it's just dark.. from the beginning to the very very end!These are the flaws of this movie, everything else was well made.. the breathtaking scenes mixed with amazing performances with great story.Sicario is a great movie, and I'm gonna give it an A-.Alright, next one is Sicario: Day of the Soldado, stick around. And thanks for reading my review, wish you like it.",

After a stunningly horrific opening the film meanders disappointingly before advancing the story in to any meaningful or understandableThe problem with Sicario is that it is too much of an infuriating mystery before it becomes anything else. After a stunningly horrific opening the film meanders disappointingly before advancing the story in to any meaningful or understandable context. Dealing as it does with the drug trade between Mexico and the states, the picture is predictably violent requiring constant viewer attention, but is never boring. The screenplay is generally fine, but there are definitely situations that are questionable plot contrivances (Officials fast tracking cars through the border only to have them caught in a traffic jam; The pointless act of obtaining Blunt’s signature to stop her talking, and even Del Toro’s motive for his involvement in the operation). The traffic jam shootout is actually a very good set piece and, whilst the film may take its time for three quarters of its length, there is no denying the power and tension created in the last half an hour. The sound and music add volumes in atmosphere and the performances of the three leads are good.\rJosh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro both play unsympathetic characters. Brolin comes over as smug and confidently self-satisfied whilst Del Toro, giving the film’s best performance, is a silent and mysterious character who can turn impassively violent in a heartbeat. Surprisingly, given the early buzz on her role, Emily Blunt’s character turns out to be very reactionary to the males around her. For much of the running time she hasn’t a clue as to what is going on and seems to be there either to be brutalised or ignored, appearing naïve and out of her depth. Considering that this is the type of lead that would normally have gone to a male star it is all the more surprising a let-down. This is definitely not a performance heading for an Oscar nomination despite her excellence at what little is required of her.",

Personally, I put Sicario behind Prisoners and Enemy judging from how great Jake Gyllenhaal's acting for both movies, originality and the intensity that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Overall, Sicario is still an amazing movie and one of the best of this year so far.\rAs the main character, Emily Blunt gives a perfect performance that make us feel and empathize what she is going through throughout the movie. We can feel her frustration, pain, anger and disappointment through her face with just few dialogs. The very last scene really did it for me and it broke my heart. However, Benicio Del Toro as Alejandro gives the best performance of the whole movie.\rThe writing in this movie is amazing.  There are a lot of questions raised in this movie and they answer them seamlessly and perfectly at the right time just to keep us entertained until the very last scene.\rThe cinematography in this movie is the one that really blows my mind. There are a lot of scenes that you just think \"Wow, that is really beautiful\". However, for me this is also one of the weakness of this movie because they just keep showing you these beautifully shot scenes that is not necessary to the storyline given the limited amount of dialog and longer runtime of this movie.",

However, after about the first half hour, I found the movie riveting. I thought the cast was great, especially Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin, but they played the most exciting characters. Emily Blunt, on the other hand, had the most difficult role as the “pawn in the game,” yet you were always interested in her and what was happening to her even though she was as confused and suspicious about what was going on as the audience was most of the time. To make a character like that sympathetic is a neat trick. The movie also managed a message about the “drug wars” – which was perhaps the neatest trick of all – about why they exist at all and how cruel they are, which puts the movie a cut above most action films where the violence is simply meant to entertain.",

I just finished watching this movie at 10pm and I had to get this review out ASAP. I will start with the story which is cliché but it's also indomitably told in real time. I know a handful of movies that use flashbacks to tell the story but this one doesn't and I enjoy that fact. I will say this much about the story that it's about an FBI agent tasked with helping a non-disclosed agency take down a Cartel. I will now move onto the acting which brought there A-Game for sure. The cast is incredibly strong with Emily Blunt,Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro being the main three characters. They are all fascinating but Del Toro in my opinion blows the movie out of the water with his character. They all have fantastic rapport. I will now move onto the action which while this isn't a Michael Bay movie the scenes that do take place are on point with excruciating detail that it boarders realism. The scenes are violent and bloody and are meant to invoke a certain feeling of awe and dread simultaneously. I must also talk about the cinematography which was done by Roger Deakins who is a mastermind when it comes to the angles and etc of the film and it's absolutely Phenomenal in every aspect and it brings the movie to life and the sounds of everything in the movie from the gunfire to the city aspect will leave you transfixed onto the screen. The banter between the characters including the Delta Force Operators is impeccably done. The director Denis Villeneuve was terrific and I applaud him for such a powerhouse of a motion picture. I will finish by saying this is my new favorite movie of 2015 which prior was \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" but this takes the whole bakery. I would recommend watching this movie without a doubt.

It is a testimony to EB's skill that we remain involved with Kate/Kat whose curiosity does lead to her undoing.  If Sicario had focused more on her moral quandary (duty and greater good versus breaking the law and doing bad things) and less on her drive to understand, she would have been much more believeable.  Instead, we want to shout \"who cares why, just walk away from this moral morass\".  I am tempted (a little) to watch Sicario again without the confusion.  But no, I'm not that curious.",

I normally don't pay great attention to little details like that in films, but the sound of the guns among other things sounded so realistic, giving the film even more of an unexpected sense of realism. The story was intriguing, well-written, and often kept me fixated and wondering what was going to happen next. Overall, despite kind of a slow pace towards the beginning, the film quickly picks up and doesn't let go until its final moments.

His performance is easily worthy of an Oscar nomination. Josh Brolin and Emily Blunt areSicario is a powerful movie, an important movie.   It’s the best movie I’ve seen so far this year.  The casting is perfect.  Benicio Del Toro is superb.  His performance is easily worthy of an Oscar nomination. Josh Brolin and Emily Blunt are also extremely good.  As a hardened movie watcher, this is my kind of movie.\rThe movie maintains a consistently high level of dramatic tension.   It also has the necessary level of believability and realism.  While the level of violence is very high, it’s not what I would consider gratuitous.  Sicario isn’t as dark as No country for Old Men, but if you tend to hide your face at such movies, then Sicario probably isn’t for you.\rEmily Blunt plays a by-the-book FBI agent who volunteers for an assignment being run by James Brolin, purportedly under the auspices of the Department of Defense, to disrupt the Mexican drug cartels.  The ruthlessness of these drug lords is unquestioned, a point evidenced through scenes of mutilated bodies hung from ropes beneath city bridges in Juarez, Mexico, and further driven home when Del Torro suggests to Blunt that the victims probably didn’t even do anything wrong, the drug lords simply want people to know that this is what happens to you if you do something they don’t like.  Juarez, which is just across the border from El Paso, is one of the deadliest cities in the world.\rThe story is a twist on a couple of old tropes.  In Sicario (and maybe in real life), America and Mexico are losing the battle against the drug cartels.  Brolin has been authorized to do whatever it takes to turn the tide.  Benicio Del Toro, whose background is even murkier than Brolin’s, has been enlisted to help.   Blunt is recruited to join the team for reasons that aren’t revealed to her.  She’s neither a new agent, nor a jaded veteran.   She’s been exposed to some hard core violence and death, and she’s performed well, but she’s not a fully seasoned veteran.\rAfter joining Brolin’s team, it quickly becomes clear that Blunt is in way over her head.  In addition, she strongly objects to the methodology employed by Brolin as being both illegal and immoral.  (If your enemy is helpless and you kill him, are you any better than your enemy?)\rThe film maker wants you to agonize over is whether Blunt is right or wrong in her convictions.   As if to further inflame the tension, the movie pits masculine against feminine.  Blunt is the only female in the group.  The movie taunts you with a female lead character that may not be as smart or as wise as you would like her to be.  But this is red herring, meant to test you’re feminist sensitivities.  As an actor, I like Blunt a lot, and to her credit, she takes the role that she is given and she plays it great.  But, in the end, Del Torro dominates.  In the not-soon-to-be-forgotten closing scene, Benicio tells Blunt to, ‘go home, you’ll never survive here.  This is the land of wolves and you’re no wolf.’\rWhen Oscar time rolls around, you’re going to hear a lot of people say, “I never heard of that film, what’s it about?”  Don’t be like that.  Go see this film.",

He shows we run in a cycle, and if you change something for the ‘better’, things always end up worse. In a way he shows chaos theory.\rEmily Blunt is a great character but it is Benicio Del Toro who is the biggest star of this, and in one scene with him towards the end of the film he had 75% of the audience in my cinema gasp.\rAn incredible film, although personally I’d say I enjoyed Prisoners a tad more.\r7.9/10",

Emily Blunt smashes her role as a morally conscience FBI agent with a need to hunt down the bad guys. The films overall tone is gritty and dark, highlighting the harsh reality of the violence and horror that occurs in the modern world of America as well as parts of Mexico. Benicio Del Toro nails it as a mysterious and deadly antagonist and this really shines in his scenes with Blunt, conveying an underling light vs dark and good vs evil theme. Sicario's cinematography is brilliant. The film is definitely one of the best looking of 2015 with vibrant and colorful backdrops, juxtaposing heavily with the dark scenes transpiring in the foreground. Josh Brolin and Daniel Kaluuya also are strong supporting actors, both providing the film with a heightened sense of urgency as well as a balanced level of comic relief which doesn't take away from the films overarching narrative. Sicario is a well written story, however the film does fall short in some scenes with slow moving plot points and a handful of unnecessary scenes. Nonetheless, Sicario deserves praise for a gripping story, stellar and intense action pieces, strong performances in most characters as well as a chilling finish which will leave viewers on the edge of their seats.",

The casting.A convoluted and obtuse plot badly paced can't be explained away by using adjectives like 'gritty' and 'edgy'. But slow exposition aside there are some tense sequences which are entertaining but for the major flaw in this film. The casting.\r Seriously - Emily Blunt is totally superfluous to the story as is her sidekick. Not only is the presence of this jarring duo unnecessary, but Emily's presence amongst the Delta soldiers and other tough guys comes off as forced and weak. The 'tough female protagonist' angle they were aiming for falls absolutely flat and ends up looking quite absurd.\r Ultimately what could have been a serviceable action thriller is undermined by silly casting probably done for 'diversity' reasons - Hollywood insists on pushing this unrealistic feminist/social justice narrative which sees Emily blunt look like a fish out of water and her black guy buddy totally useless and superfluous. If you are going to cast a tough female... at least give her character some flesh to go with the bones and some contextual reason in the plot for actually being there.\r It got quite amusing in the end - tense action sequences followed by numerous scenes of Emily Blunt smoking. Action (in which Emily is pretty much a passenger). Emily Smoking. Emily needs a new bra (that's in the film). Action. Emily smoking.\r Meh.",

The final scene with Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro is among the best that I have seen this year.\r Sicario's combination of gruesome violence and minimal soundtrack creates this strange atmosphere to the film. It is amidst the most depressing I've see. Now I'm not talking about tear-jerking sad films, but about that sort of bleak hopelessness that is hard to get right.\r Recently there was an article that said they are planning a sequel with Benicio Del Toro's character and I wondered how would they do that since the film's focus is on Kate. She embodies the film's point. Very quickly you notice that she is the only female character in a land of men. I think this was a deliberate choice to further showcase how she stands out in this world, a world without the good guys.

With a predictable plot on a well-worn theme, and with little dialogue of note, it's very hard for Villeneuve to sustain any dramatic tension. What tension there is is largely supplied by an excellent and suitably grim soundtrack. The film's 'message', if that's the right word, is that after decades of politicians' rhetoric about 'the war on drugs', the reality is that this is what drug enforcement has become - just another bloody war - with all that implies for the rule of law and the pursuit of justice.

Emily Blunt is phenomenal here, but is actually outdone by Benicio del Toro. I love Del Toro's work, but this has to be his very best. He is out of this world in this role and hits a complete home run. Sicario is a fantastic film and one of the year's strongest works, but what do you expect when Villenueve, Deakins, Blunt, and Del Toro, work together?",

And the ending sure as hell brands, tattos and kneads that into your brain. My god, the ending was just visually chilling, morally disgusting but intriguingly beautiful. The acting was fine in this film, good quality nothing to complain about. Cinematography was fantastic also. My only real gripe with this film was the slight decrease in thrills in the second act and sometimes Josh Brolins humour, whilst slight, didn't always fit in with the tone trying to be set (although it was particularly well done). So I urge you to see this film, especially for the ending because it will cling to you like a parasite, guaranteed",

It is unflinching in its depiction of the violence and brutality of the cartels. At the same time, it readily admits that the War on Drugs has been, for all intents and purposes, a chaotic failure of its own ambitions. It is left to the audience to decide which of these two realities is more shocking.\r This is a film with a solid narrative made spellbinding by its performances and direction. Kinetic, suspenseful and beautifully shot, the film is able to run deeper thanks to its actors. Emily Blunt is a capable and engaging lead. The drug war threatens to consume her innocence and the desperation of her resistance is heartbreaking to watch. Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro, meanwhile, both turn in career-best performances that ought to have it out for the Supporting Actor Oscar. Of the two, del Toro has the edge. Brolin is faultless, lending Matt's bravado and guile a sinister quality, but del Toro is imposingly hypnotic as the enigmatic Alejandro. He drifts around the action like a phantom until he springs into action with electrified intensity and the presence of a whirlwind. The final act belongs to him.",

From a technical standpoint it is a beautifully shot, tightly directed, and cleverly acted crime/police thriller, and from a narrative standpoint, its a dark, grimey, depressing, and all too believable tale about the inevitable slide into \"ends justify the means\" tactics employed by agencies fighting the War on Drugs and the conflict between the need to uphold the law versus actually making a difference.\r The film boasts strong performances from Emily Blunt as the out-of-her-depth FBI agent Kate Macer, Josh Brolin as the pragmatic and ruthless operative Matt Graver, and Benicio del Toro as the enigmatic and menacing Alejandro. Behind the camera, the direction from Denis Villeneuve and sublime cinematography by Roger Deakins present this grimey desperate world with skill and flair, while the film is backed by a dark brooding soundtrack that keeps the gloomy, threatening tone throughout.\r This movie is definitely not for the faint hearted; its relentlessly violent and dark and offer little in the way of hope, but if you don't mind stepping into the shadows and getting a little dirty, this is a thriller not to miss.",

At the heart of Sciario, the plot is quite simple, a talented FBI rookie- Kate (Emily Blunt) gets called up to a higher up narcotics unit who claim that their fight makes a difference and if she wants to make a difference and start dealing with higher level cartel mafia they were the only unit which can help her out. The said unit led by Graver (Josh Borlin) has hired a special contractor Alejandro Gillick (Benecio Del Toro) of mysterious origins who is a smooth multilingual talker and a ruthless killer all rolled into one; basically James Bond without all the womanizing and silliness. Gillick and Graver take liberties during their missions and don't go about their business by the books in fact sometimes they seem bigger criminals than the drug cartel they fight against. Kate is an idealist and this disturbs her, but at the same time she also wants to make a difference, this theme is the meat and potatoes of the movie. I personally found this theme a lot more relatable than Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners' \"I will fall to any depths for my child\" theme because I am not a parent and but still old enough to realize that how many times I wish I could have done something which really mattered to the society I live in. Everyone's great here, Emily Blunt and Josh Brolin perform well but the man who is the spirit of this movie and it's namesake is the Sciario (meaning The Hit-man) himself- Benecio Del Toro, we find the Academy Award winner here in top form, I was reminded of the fact how physically imposing he was when he towered above Josh Brolin (who is a big guy himself); coupled with the fact he was so intimidating, this was a great casting choice and I hope to see a nomination for Del Toro in Best Supporting Actor category.\r Some things I wish the film did better was if it dealt with the details, the nitty gritties which I enjoyed in Black Mass, what's the hierarchy of the cartel? How is the business carried out? How is the load distributed? Answers to these questions are lacking in this movie and it is details like this which truly elevate crime films and make them realistic. The ending was also a little too Gung-Ho for my liking, I also liked the fact while this film had better editing than Prisoners, the film still had some \"fat\" and could have been trimmed by fifteen minutes or so. Lastly, I am glad that this movie had a very unique well shot encounter between the Cartel and Narcotics unit it was in an underground tunnel of sorts and the shots alternated between night vision and normal vision while ominous music played in the background, good stuff, I like that Villeneuve has made this more visually appealing than his previous works.",

It stars Benicio Del Torro, Emily Blunt, and Josh Brolin.\r Sicario revolves around an idealistic FBI agent enlisted by an elected government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico. I adore this movie I really do so I want to get my problems out of the way before I dive head first into all the goodies. My problem with the movie was simply the pacing. For the first half of the movie the movie drags and picks up in equal measure till a bar scene which just makes the movie flawless onward.\r Firstly the writing was phenomenal! Taylor Sheridan demonstrated perfectly all the darkness brewing under the surface between drug cartels. He also showed that it takes both sides of the border to do these crimes.Thus demonstrating the evils of the U.S. and Mexico. Through this, it was made clear that the corruption and greed of the U.S. go hand and hand with the poverty and desperation of Mexico to the point of true unadulterated terror.\r Next is The one, the only Dennis Villeneuve. With mastery of the material Villeneuve painted all the characters a shade of gray before revealing their true selves. He accomplished this through beautiful camera work and magnificent shots. With the help of living legend cinematographer, Roger Deakins this movie is a technical masterwork.\r Just as great if not better was the acting. Emily Blunt offers some of her best work, giddily ridding the underbelly of drug busts with remarkable finesse. Her role demanded sheer brutal emotion and she more than delivered. Accompanying her, Josh Brolin does some of the best work he's done in years. Working as a bit of a comic relief and as a brutal wake up call to both U.S. and Mexican citizens alike. Heart wrenching and breaking these two fine actor's churn out the very best in each other.\r By far the best supporting performance I've this year was offered by none other than Benicio Del Torro. His cool and understated performance is can only be compared to Javier Bardem in \"No Country for Old Men.\" He was as menacing as he was sympathetic and all the audience and do is sit and watch in amazement and disgust as we slowly unravel this multidimensional character. Del Torro's performance can only be called bravura.\r Sicario is a wonderfully dark and twisted, yet timely and poignant movie with a strong cast led by brilliant work by Del Torro. Sicario Gets an A or a 9/10.",

Actually this is the first line of the 2000 movie “Traffic” but describes both movies.\r I had heard good word of mouth about “Sicario” and with 7 new movies opening today I put a question as which one to see on the film buffs facebook page and the vote was overwhelmingly for this movie. All I have to ask is, “why?” Yes, Benicio Del Toro gives a mesmerizing performance, as a former Columbian who was a prosecutor and has good reason to hate drug dealers. It is explained that sicario is slang for a hitman and he defines the term. One of the many things I didn’t like about the movie is that you will know the reason why before it is spelled out. Josh Brolin, a favorite of mine, as head of a task force but for who unknown, gives a solid performance. I have heard much about Emily Blunt’s performance but I found her to be way out of her depth as an equal FBI agent in the playing field of macho acting men.\r Anyone who has even seen a movie about drug cartels know it is a rough, tough no holds barred, world of killing and “Sicario” shows that from the opening with a house invasion exposing dozens of rotting bodies in plastic, followed by naked bodies hanging upside down in the Mexican streets. Shortly after there is a scene of the ‘good’ guys slaughtering 8-10 guys in a traffic tie-up at the border.  Later there is torturing with water, beatings, forcibly poking of a finger in someone’s ear and, yes, the scene of a lone man shooting, killing 7 men. While the point of violence is necessary to show there are quite a few gratuitous scenes.\r There is a strong supporting cast from Jon Bernthal as a pickup in a bar to Bernardo Saracino as a major cartel boss and  Julio Cesar Cedillo as a minor one along with Daniel Kaluuya, as Blunt’s partner, who requires a suspension of belief to accept his character and Victor Garber as one of the many bosses of the American team along with others.\r While direction by Denis Villkeneuve is very professional neither he nor the screenwriter Taylor Sheridan bring anything new to the drug trafficking movie including that it is violent and bad guys on both sides of the fence. The opening music was, to me, a blasting wall of sound and at times during the film very intrusive while at times thye camera work of Roger Deakins was really first rate.\r Now I need to know what the film buffs who recommended the film saw in “Sicario” that I didn’t.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nAn idealistic FBI agent is enlisted by an elected government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico.\r Sicario is another well crafted, tense thriller from director Denis Villeneuve, scripted by 'Sons of Anarchy' writer Taylor Sheridan, and shot beautifully by none other than Roger Deakins. It drags you, face first, into the raging drug war between US forces and Mexican cartels. South of the border, we see a house raid that uncovers dead bodies decaying behind walls. An explosion results in the deaths of several men belonging to Emily Blunt's team. It puts her on a mission to draw out one of the major drug lords responsible, with U.S. forces led by Josh Brolin, cooperating alongside the silent and mysterious Benicio del Toro.\r Once into Juarez, Mexico, we see a disturbing scene of mutilated corpses hanging in the street. This is part of a 15 to 20 minute scene of pure tension that grips you from start to finish. Steady photography follows a police convoy through the streets and traffic. Ariel shots glide over the city and dry landscape. A haunting score with it's ominous deep rumbling is present throughout. The scene ends with a brutal shootout on a border crossing. It's the beginning of Blunt's journey into a mission that blurs the line between crime and justice.\r The cast are all on top of their game. Emily Blunt has starred in a variety of roles in different genres, and here we see her tough yet vulnerable, a believer in justice and going by the book. Benicio del Toro becomes more important as the story progresses, his motivations unclear until the end, a frightening figure with a hunger for revenge. Josh Brolin is also great, a shady task force leader who knows everything about the brutal world he operates in. My one complaint was the little time given to the the drug lords who are only introduced towards the end.\r With a runtime of two hours, the film never out stays it's welcome. The tone is consistent and rarely strays from the tense and grim style, with spots of humour here and there. The pace of the film ticks along nicely without over explaining or rushing important scenes. Again, the score by Johann Johannsson is fantastic with low rumblings that build into a wall of noise.\r Suspenseful, compelling and sophisticated on it's own terms, Sicario mostly side steps mainstream predictable expectations, and it's all the better for it.",

From my perspective, Blunt and her partner, were badly miscast, because in this film none of the macho male characters (CIA, DEA, Special Forces) would have allowed her to even be on the team. As one of them said to her at the end of the movie, \"get at the end of the line, keep your finger off the trigger, and don't shoot any of my men [in the back].\"  If the role had been played by Jessica Chastain or A. Jolie, this film would have been a 10! See it anyway!",

There are sections in the movie that drag. This is because, even though the screenplay itself is intelligent, the underlying story is not really anything special. However, when things hit the fan in this movie, they really hit the fan. It starts with a bang and the finale (the whole last half hour +) is really something. Altogether it's a well acted, extremely well shot, smart, and distinctive movie. Plus Benicio Del Toro is just freaking awesome.",
