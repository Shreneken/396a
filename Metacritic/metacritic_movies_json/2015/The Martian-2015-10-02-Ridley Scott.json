    "summary": "During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to EarthDuring a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. Millions of miles away, NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring \u201cthe Martian\u201d home, while his crewmates concurrently plot a daring, if not impossible rescue mission. As these stories of incredible bravery unfold, the world comes together to root for Watney\u2019s safe return. [20th Century Fox]\u2026 Expand",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "What\u2019s so fascinating about the film is that it truly turns on the solving of problems, and its chief solver, stuck on Mars, manages to be so funny, interesting and infallibly likable that you\u2019re invested in his predicament at every moment.",
        "It takes a genuine master craftsman to take something as complex and difficult as this and make it look easy, but it also takes an artist with a great ear to take something as dense with exposition as this is and make it practically sing.",
        "Ridley Scott's The Martian is a brainy blockbuster, melding genuine science and fiction into a rare popcorn epic that actually makes you feel smarter for watching.",
        "Scott\u2019s sci-fi adventure is the kind of film you leave the theater itching to tell your friends to see. Like Apollo 13 and Gravity, it turns science and problem solving into an edge-of-your-seat experience.",
        "The Martian is shot, designed, computer-generated, and scripted on a level that makes most films of its ilk look slipshod. Scott and writer Drew Goddard aren\u2019t trying to make an \u201cimportant\u201d sci-fi movie like Interstellar. They aim lower but blow past their marks.",
        "You can argue that the plot of The Martian doesn\u2019t offer many surprises, but this is a movie of innumerable delightful moments and small discoveries, and even more of infectious enthusiasm.",
        "The Martian is a film that respects the geekiest among us, and that pays off all around.",
        "Perhaps most importantly, not only does the film stress the importance of using math and physics and botany and chemistry to solve problems, but it also makes a plot based on scientific inquiry and audacity just as exciting and even more unpredictable as the movies\u2019 usual brand of problem-solving, the kind that involves punching everyone and then blowing everything up.",
        "An enthralling and rigorously realistic outer-space survival story.",
        "This suspenseful survival tale, smartass to its core, slaps a smile on your face that you'll wear all the way home.",
        "The supporting cast is an embarrassment of riches for Scott, and Chastain is particularly strong as the concerned commander of the mission. Yet this is most definitely Damon\u2019s movie and a throwback to the unabashed idealism of Hollywood past.",
        "It's one of the most comforting science fiction films in years.",
        "The Martian is a straightforward and thrilling survival-and-rescue adventure, without the metaphysical and emotional trappings of, say, \u201cInterstellar.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s pure fun.",
        "The Martian really, truly works \u2014 not as art, necessarily, but as the sort of epic, intelligent entertainment the mainstream film industry has supposedly forgotten how to craft. All that, and the movie\u2019s a valentine to creative collaboration as well as an example of it. It\u2019s enough to make you almost grateful.",
        "The Martian is never less than engaging, and often much more than that.",
        "The Martian is nearly all things to all audiences: a ticking-clock drama, an intimate character study, a sci-fi comedy, a rollicking space adventure. It\u2019s almost impossible to dislike, which is perhaps its only flaw. When a huge film reveals its eager-to-please intentions from the get-go, the stakes evaporate awfully quick.",
        "This is science fiction for sophisticated audiences and, as such, a fulfilling and satisfying experience.",
        "What\u2019s being marketed as a sober, straightforward sci-fi drama (the words \u201cBring him home\u201d superimposed on an unsmiling Matt Damon inside a space helmet) is instead a smart, exhilarating, often disarmingly funny return to classic adventures of yore.",
        "The most fascinating thing about the film is how it leans into predictability rather than make a show of fighting it.",
        "Damon is terrific. The movie lives and breathes on his performance, and he comes through in every scene.",
        "At its heart, The Martian is an unapologetically stirring celebration of our ability, as a species, to solve even the most daunting problems via rational thought, step by step by step. It\u2019s basically \"Human Ingenuity: The Movie.\"",
        "Damon has never seemed more at home than he does here, millions of miles adrift.",
        "[An] enormously entertaining movie.",
        "Mr. Damon\u2019s Everyman quality (he\u2019s our Jimmy Stewart) helps scale the story down, but what makes this epic personal is Mr. Scott\u2019s filmmaking, in which every soaring aerial shot of the red planet is answered by the intimate landscape of a face.",
        "The animating humanism of Scott\u2019s film is irreducible. It\u2019s a wry tribute to the qualities that got our species into space in the first place: our resourcefulness, our curiosity and our outsized, ridiculous, beautiful brains.",
        "Bringing optimism, nerd-itude and a touch of crazy to his character's solo ordeal\u2014at one point, scraggly Watney calls himself a \u201cspace pirate\u201d\u2014Damon is the key to the movie\u2019s exuberance.",
        "Anchored by another great turn from Matt Damon, The Martian mixes smarts, laughs, weird character bits and tension on a huge canvas. The result is Scott\u2019s most purely enjoyable film for ages.",
        "It\u2019s not iconic sci-fi to match Alien or Blade Runner but it is a topical, supremely crafted, intelligent, heartfelt spectacle with gallows humour to die for. Strap yourself in.",
        "The director and screenwriter downplay the conventional melodrama inherent in the situation in favor of emphasizing how practical problems should be addressed with rational responses rather than hysteria, knee-jerk patriotism or selfish expedience.",
        "While there are a few loose ends in Drew Goddard\u2019s screenplay, which is faithful to but necessarily less detailed than its source, the film is a triumph of storytelling, a tribute to the power of the crowd-pleaser.",
        "Entertaining as the movie often is, this all-American, can-do attitude is also the source of its shortcomings. Given the enormousness of its subject, there is a radical lack of awe in this movie.",
        "What makes The Martian work is Damon.",
        "A gorgeous film that could inspire a whole new crop of astronauts.",
        "Yes, The Martian does look like it was shot on Mars, even though the film\u2019s tone is suspiciously light and cheerful for Scott, who tends to thrive on a chillier, more dour habitat.",
        "A lot of the information in The Martian will be incomprehensible to the lay audience and the climax is\u2026well, not exactly original. But it makes for one hell of an entertaining ride.",
        "The Martian celebrates both the indomitable human spirit and the belief that our species can, with patience and common sense, think its way out of almost any problem. If the film occasionally preaches, its message strikes home.",
        "The coolest sequences in the film are its first third, with Watney\u2019s communication cut off and NASA unaware he\u2019s there.",
        "As commercial entertainment, The Martian delivers on expectations of a \"smart\" blockbuster even as it adheres to the formula of a relatively simple feel-good drama. Though \"Interstellar\" aimed for more ambition, The Martian plays it safer: It's a brainy studio effort that sticks to familiar ground in more ways than one.",
        "The Martian is the most purely enjoyable picture Scott has made in years. The streamlined narrative and the film\u2019s consistent pacing, aided by a cast who don\u2019t make a wrongfooted move, makes for easy popcorn entertainment.",
        "Visually spectacular and consistently entertaining, Ridley Scott\u2019s space rescue procedural The Martian suffers only from a failure to hit its emotional beats with the amount of force and feeling usually required to make this kind of life-and-death adventure really take off.",
        "The Martian is only partly a story about a man in peril; it's mostly a story about men (and a few women) taking control of the uncontrollable. It's confident, swaggering sci-fi, not the despairing kind. That may be why, as elaborate and expensive-looking as The Martian is, it's almost totally lacking in poetry.",
        "The Martian is ultimately a love letter to the spirit that saw humanity reach for the stars in the first place. When it's channelling that spirit via Damon and witty writing it lifts off, but then can't quite sustain its trajectory in orbit.",
        "It\u2019s a film about micromanaging, fixing things on the fly, and a lot of Ridley\u2019s gruff, technocrat personality shines through.",
        "A wide-eyed tribute to human ingenuity that packs enough snark to pull itself out of the black hole of earnestness, even if its fuel runs out partway through.",
        "The new Ridley Scott movie is fascinating and charming and crammed and overstuffed, and it\u2019s a curious case, too. It gets all the seemingly hard things wonderfully right, but then caves in at points that should have been easy.",
        "The film goes in for the idea of texture and tics and human behavior, but there's no conviction, and no real push for eccentricity."

Yeah, Mad Max was absolutely incredible, but the Marian is easily one of the most satisfying science fiction films I've seen this year, and i love science fiction.\r This is the most grounded science fiction film I've seen. Everything felt so real, and the tension experienced by the main Character, excellently portrayed by Matt Damon, makes the situation feel ever so human as he find the determination to beat the odds and try his damnedest to survive. Also the film is just so dammed funny, its great to see a film not make this horrifying situation a sad angsty ride. The Martian is also the most motivational film i've seen in years.

I'm very interested in space topics, though, so I thought I'd at least enjoy it. Sadly, I really did not.\r For a movie about such a truly horrific and desolate situation, I was shocked that its tone was highly upbeat for 90% of the movie.\r I found it lacking in tension, emotion, and character development. I thought it was much longer than it needed to be. There were times I was really truly bored. When the last montage came on, I felt myself drift off. There were so many montages.\r The stakes for Mark's survival were never very high. He didn't appear to have much of a family at home that he missed (he asks Lewis to send his love to his parents once, but that's it), everything seemed to go very well for him in general. He always had a perfect solution for everything, he was basically super human. The isolation of his situation raree showed in his character. He got a bit huffy once when something broke and he was a bit emotional when he was finally being rescued, but he showed none of the signs of a person completely isolated for a year. He had no development and no attachments.\r The sense of humor throughout felt cheesy to me. I cringed a lot. The jokes were like a what a 35 year old science professor picked up from a few months on the Internet. The use of curse words as humor is only funny if you're very young. I can't believe I'm seeing praise for that.\r I thought the supporting characters were soulless. When asked if they would spend another bunch of years in space to return for Mark, not a SINGLE one objected? Everything in this universe existed for Mark and no one else. He was the universe's priority\r Donald Glover's character was bizzare, he existed for cheap, immature laughs.\r One thing I will say is, it built a bit of tension when they were finally executing the rescue, but ultimately those scenes left me missing Interstellar and Gravity.\r Overall, I really don't get the hype. This movie was boring, often cringe-worthy and lacked tension. The protagonist was cocky, didn't have many emotional attachments to earth and was smarter than everyone else.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nI realize this probably won't be a popular review, but I don't understand why everyone is praising this film so much. I'll list off the pros and cons to show why I'm giving it a 4/10.\rPros: The science is accurate,\rThe movie is visually stunning (seen in 3D IMAX)\r Cons: First, the film gets its tone all wrong. For a film that is basically Robinson Crusoe set on Mars, The Martian is oddly lighthearted. The result is that the movie has absolutely no tension. You know Mark isn't going to die, that he's going to be brought home safe, and that every problem is going to have a solution which requires no one to sacrifice their well-being, which makes for a boring movie.\rSecond, the other reason it's a boring movie is that most of the problems are solved through deus ex machina. \"Oh no, we blew up our rocket!\" \"Oh hey, how convenient that the Chinese government has a spare rocket engine we can use, and that they're willing to share this state secret solely out of the kindness of their hearts, despite the fact that there is no plot buildup to this solution whatsoever.\" There are plenty of other examples, but I won't list them all to save space. The point is that the film lacks verisimilitude as a result.\rThird, absolutely no person has any character development. Mark, who is stranded by himself on a hostile planet for two years, remains the same character type throughout the movie. His isolation doesn't seem to impact his psyche at all.This is really weird and took me out of the story. The script writer seems to think that everyone getting new jobs at the end of the movie serves as character development.\rFourth, endless plot points that are simply tangents. Mark talks about God once at the start of the movie, and we're led to believe he probably does believe in God. Does his faith (or possible lack thereof) change his view on things? Not really. Does his view on God change at all through this difficult experience? Not really. So why is it brought up? For a cheap, lighthearted joke. Mark talks about his parents once. Do we ever see them? No. Do we know anything about them or anything about Mark's other relatives? Not really. Most of the side characters work this way too. Donald Glover plays a geeky astrophysicist who solves a difficult science problem, receiving a few minutes of screen time. Do we ever see him again? Not until the end credits. Half of the characters work this way!\r Sorry this review is so long, but the cons take a lot of space to accurately map out. In short, The Martian plays out as if it was written by a high school science teacher. It's filled with science experiments meant to keep people interested, but all the characters are bland, static, and in no danger. Somehow, Ridley Scott managed to make an incredibly sterile movie about space exploration.",

Although technically science fiction by virtue of its being largely set on a neighboring planet, this smartly made adaptation of Andy Weir\u2019s best-selling novel is more realistic in its attention to detail than many films set in the present, giving the story the feel of an adventure that could happen the day after tomorrow. Constantly absorbing rather than outright exciting, this major autumn Fox release should generate muscular business worldwide.\r Scott has famously been up in space before, thrillingly in Alien, far less so in Prometheus (a sequel to which he is currently preparing). This time, he\u2019s telling a survival story, pure and simple, of an American astronaut, thought to be dead, who\u2019s left behind on Mars when an enormous storm compels his five fellow crew members to hastily cut short their extra-planetary visit. It\u2019s Robinson Crusoe on Mars, but without the monkey and aliens.\r When Mark Watney (Matt Damon) regains consciousness after having been impaled by an errant antenna and knocked out, he quickly assesses the situation: He\u2019s millions of miles from home and, based on the food supply, concludes that he\u2019s got a month to live. But he\u2019s by nature a can-do, optimistic kind of guy, a botanist by profession possessed of a sardonic, self-deprecating sense of humor, and decides that he has no intention of dying, even though the next Mars mission from home isn\u2019t due to arrive for another four years.\r Most of the early-going is devoted to the man making calculations as to how he can maximize his time on the arid planet, beginning by growing more potatoes from the ones he\u2019s got (in part by using his own homemade manure). Living in the relatively spacious quarters he and his colleagues set up, Mark cannibalizes everything he can, carefully apportions his rations and settles in for the long term; at moments the biggest threat to his sanity is the exclusive collection of \u201870s disco music left behind by one of his former astronauts.\r The claustrophobia and solitariness of Mark\u2019s situation is shortly broken up by events back on Earth. After Mark\u2019s tragedy has been duly mourned by the public, a sharp-eyed NASA technician notices ground movement in her surveillance of the Martian surface that could only be Mark moving around. Communication is duly re-established, which ignites both elation at his survival and frantic assessments of what it would take, and cost, to launch a rescue mission.\r Weir\u2019s book is heavy with technical assessments of food and oxygen supplies, mechanical capabilities, flight duration and the physics of inter-planetary travel. Screenwriter Drew Goddard (World War Z, Cloverfield) has respected all these details while whittling them down to manageable and comprehensible levels. Officials at NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (represented by a lively and individualistic cast including Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mackenzie Davis and Donald Glover) do everything they can to develop a feasible rescue plan and are ultimately helped out by a surprising foreign partner.\r But ultimately it comes down to the willingness of Mark\u2019s astronaut colleagues (Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie) to place themselves at great risk by attempting a long-shot rescue attempt, a decision that raises the provocative moral dilemma of whether it\u2019s correct to put five lives at great risk for the remote reward of saving one life.\r Scott does generate a degree of suspense in this climactic stretch, but the film\u2019s overall tone is dominated by the characters\u2019 collegial humor, mutual respect among professionals and smart people being tested by an unprecedented challenge. The director and screenwriter downplay the conventional melodrama inherent in the situation in favor of emphasizing how practical problems should be addressed with rational responses rather than hysteria, knee-jerk patriotism or selfish expedience.\r Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski turns the neat trick of providing the film with a fundamental documentary reality while also making a thing of great beauty. Extra attentiveness is amply on display in all creative departments.\r Ridley's back in (a good) space.",

Abandoned upon the desolate surface of Mars after being presumed dead by his crew, Damon must do all he can to endure the martian environment. One huge thing I admire about this film's plot, is that it doesn't care about the intellectual level of its audience, as the quote above states so well: it'll science the **** out of them. It's such a complex and well-executed premise that on paper seems nothing more than a impossible feat to pull off.Technically this film is stunning, the cinematography, the CGI, the production design, all utterly gorgeous, and according to the Golden Globes, it's one of the best comedies of recent years too... yeah, sure. Admittedly the tongue-in-cheek humour does add a more fresh appeal to the film, making it a little more unique than previous sci-fi adventures, it piles on layers of thrills, emotional value and complex character development to create one of the finest science fiction films of recent years.",

That was my only real negative for this film and stopped this being a 10/10 for me.\r The length of the film did not worry us. At no stage did we feel things drag on. If anything there was quite a bit of content cut from the book but I feel it did not damage the film. The way Mars itself was filmed (CGI, etc) was beautiful and haunting at the same time.

Yes,The fact that this film received so many good reviews has made me lose my respect for humanity. It seems North American culture has been seriously dumbed-down, now lacking any measure of critical thought. This film was mediocre at best. Yes, the Mars landscape was nicely done; but visual effects alone don't make a decent movie - the effects of Gravity were much better, in my opinion. A  good film requires a good story, plot, dialogue, suspense, acting, etc. The Martian was so predictable it was boring. Damon's acting was adequate but forgetable. I felt nothing for any of the characters, and couldn't care what happened to them as the film ignored any potential psychological and emotional aspects of the story. Most of the characters acted like frat boys, not like professionals you'd expect in these roles. Damon's \"kiss my ass Neil Armstrong\" and other painful and foul-mouthed quips seem to appeal to a \"now generation\" too wrapped up in themselves to respect and honor past achievements - a professional astronaut certainly wouldn't act like that. And the disco music score was odd, jarring, like a drunk uncle karaoke-ing at a wedding. If this film was meant to be drama/comedy/sci-fi it fell flat on all accounts, appealing to the lowest common denominator. In my opinion, this is typical Hollywood capitalist crap, enabled by a well-bribed mass media, out to rip off people for profit (why can't I get a refund?), completely lacking in substance, made for dumb people who haven't picked up a book in their lives. And the positive reviews on here and elsewhere reveal a serious decline in taste. Has everyone become pigs satisfied with slop?",

There is only one genuine scientific error in the story, and it was committed knowingly and deliberately as a plot device to strand astronaut Mark Watney: the atmospheric pressure on Mars is so low that the fiercest sandstorms could barely flutter a flag, let alone do the damage portrayed in the opening sequence. The only other quibbles involve things that we know more about today (thanks to NASA orbiters and rovers) than we did when Weir started writing: Mars does have tiny amount of liquid water at places on its surface, but it's hypersaline and undoubtedly full of toxic perchlorates; the dirt Watney wallows in would probably also have enough perchlorate in it to poison him; putting your intestinal bacteria into Martian soil, on Mars, is a major no-no according to international treaties about planetary protection: we still don't know whether Mars has any bacteria of its own, and we don't want to confuse the issue by contaminating the place with E. coli. Also, although the terrain at the novel's landing site looks smooth in maps made from orbit, in high-res view it turns out to be covered with huge potholes that would make driving vehicles difficult. And finally, the orbital maneuvers at the end of the novel, involving releasing air and flying \"like Iron Man\" are more comic book than physics book.  But those are \"errors\" only uber-nerds would cite. The novel is as hard as science fiction ever gets. The most improbable idea in it is that the US Congress would ever fund NASA enough to do these things, but NASA probably could do them were it given the funds.\r The movie stays about as close as it can to the novel, given that some of the explanations need to be simplified and some of Watney's language and humor expurgated for American audiences. So if you like rock-hard sci fi about survival on the real Mars -- with no aliens or monsters, but lots of \"I'm going to science the hell out of this\", you will love this movie.",

Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor are among the best performance in this movie. Ridley Scott did a really great job directing this movie as well as Drew Goddard for writing the screenplay. The movie is beautifully shot especially for the Mars and the space stuff. I didn't see it in 3D, and didn't think it would make a lot more differences since there are more \"non-space\" scenes than I expected. But I wouldn't mind watching it again in 3D as it is that enjoyable movie you could watch many times.\rThe writing in The Martian is good enough to keep you on the edge of your seat given how predictable the ending of this movie is. Few surprises are thrown here and there which is exciting. There is a lot of funny stuff that keeps this movie light and family friendly. For a sci-fi movie, there sure is a lot of science in this movie. For a person who knows just a little about science, this movie left me in awe watching what Mark Watney and NASA could do in a very messed-up situation one could imagine. This is also one of the weakness of this movie for me because with a lot of emphasizing in the science aspect, this movie lacks of depth for Mark Watney as the main character of this movie. I would love to see more beyond Mark Watney's optimism and his sense of humor and what is going on his mind that would make me not only root for him but also empathize for him just like what Gravity did with Sandra Bullock character. However, it is still very refreshing to me personally to see this optimistic character in a movie these days.",

But that stands out as an original, highly entertaining and beautifully directed sci-fi-adventure of science.\r The year was 2013, and \u2019Gravity\u2019 broke all expectations. Both the critics and the audience adored the space-drama. It opened an almost closed subgenre; the more realistic and scientifically accurate side of sci-fi. It smashed the box-office numbers and it\u2019s going to be the movie that changed the space-genre. 2014 delivered an ambitious and mind-but also a heart breaking-sci-fi adventure of the relationship between a father and his daughter. Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u2018Interstellar\u2019 couldn\u2019t match \u2018Gravity\u2019 and its box-office numbers, but it managed to bring big directors to the genre. 2015 is no exception and one of the most influential directors in the genre of space/horror is back; with \u2018The Martian\u2019 \u2013 the third installment in this realistic-science(-fiction) adventure that Gravity managed to put on the map.\r \u2018The Martian\u2019 stars Matt Damon as the leading role, and he subsidize with emotion and surprisingly much humor to the film. The direction by Ridley Scott is without any doubt excellent with the extraordinary cinematography and realistic views on Mars. The science-aspect is just as present and it keeps giving the movie realism in a not very distant future. We follow Mark Watney\u2019s struggle to survive on the hostile red planet, and he\u2019s very self-entertained, funny and extremely optimistic. Just his presence is exciting and the movie therefor never felt boring. He struggles with these almost impossible tasks, we see him develop through his ups and downs on his journey back to the blue planet. There\u2019re much human traces like humor, attachment and morality, and it really is about one character, left alone by himself. So uniquely done!\r It\u2019s not a movie that\u2019s action-packed nor high-paced; it\u2019s a well preformed and well written art of work and that really is entertaining. It\u2019s one aspect that might result in lost of interest by some individuals, but there are some incredibly great wow-and-high-paced moments where you really want to be there, and experience it by yourself! The 3D is better than the average movie, but doesn\u2019t add anything extraordinary to the experience. But something that totally did is the soundtrack; so fitting and baffling to the specific character and moment! But the dialogs might drag the movie down a bit; they can feel forced to the audience from time to time when it comes to facts, etc.\r The plot is not one-dimensional (but sometimes a bit predictable); it covers many characters at different locations (even planets). We have strong leading actors and well visualized characters. One minor concern is that it might have too many smaller roles, they absorb some of the excitement and focus of the movie. It loose some of the magic, especially in the third act. The main characters could also have had a greater attachment, there\u2019s no strong chemistry between them. But these are just minor aspects that could have been even greater, and it really is good movie, even though the ending might be a bit too rushed and could have covered more of the climax.\r \u2019The Martian\u2019 might not be flawless but it got a strong and funny lead from Matt Damon, and very rememberable moments that you should love to experience by yourself. It really is a realistic sci-fi flick full of humor, adventure, optimism and hope. It\u2019s the 2015-Interstellar.\r Personal rating: 8/10\rCritical rating: 8/10",

It's definitely not scientifically accurate at all levels due to minor flaws, but the story mainly focuses on the survival skills and rescue efforts which are presented in a straightforward, entertaining, chilling, educational yet inspiring way. The film is surprisingly funny compared to Interstellar and Gravity thanks to the outstanding performance from Matt Damon who delivers the character's positive attitude overshadowing the fear of being a stranded stranger on the red planet, other strong star-studded cast including Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel Ejiofor have solid performances as well as scores composed by Harry Gregson-Williams, not extremely powerful but strong enough to fit into scenes. While it seems to be a rescue mission, the film is able to deliver an important message - regardless the help from the whole world, self-initiation determines the survival opportunity. Overall at a smaller scale and fans perception, The Martian fits perfectly as sequel of 2013's Gravity and prequel to 2014's Interstellar.",

The Martian is an uplifting castaway tale on Mars. Brilliantly executed and acted, it's a triumphant story of a man surviving on his wit and sheer positive determination on live.\r The saying \"he might as well be on the moon\" doesn't apply to Mark Watney (Matt Damon) as he's stranded on a world much farther. After a critical failure on space mission leaves him alone on Mars, he must overcome multitude of problems to keep himself and the hope of rescue alive.\r For a desolated story, The Martian is incredibly inspiring. Much of it charm depends entirely on Matt's performance, his effort keeps the movie light and humorous even though tougher times linger just steps or miles away. It probably wouldn't have worked with lesser actor, not just with the dialogues but physical transformation. He brings strangely infectious joy instead of constant wallowing. The positive and identifiable attitude of his character will translate well to audience.\r This is not only a solo mission since there's also perspectives of people working on our planet. The assembly of cast is very good. From Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels and many others, these personalities are highly memorable. They make the arduous and lengthy process of space travel into an engaging spectacle. While not everyone has contact with the solitary astronaut, they convincingly unite on the larger-than-life endeavor.\r Visual is amazing. This is not the beast Gravity was, but when it gets going, it's utterly beautiful and also bizarrely captivating since Mars is a barren soil. At times it appears that Matt Damon walks across red desert which is so strange but still give the feeling that it probably exist somewhere. The amount of details on science is amazing, it feels like an inviting project or a trip audience could take with these characters. The bits of pop culture reference from comics or movies are icing of the frosty cake.\r The Martian is what a movie should strive to be, an amazingly told story of men against their predicament. It's incredibly inspiring, highly enjoyable and simply unworldly.",

I was unsure if it was trying to be a serious Sci-Fi movie or a comedy.  It has a promising set-up of potentially being Cast Away in space but I never felt the drama of the situation.  This is  probably because the majority of the drama is being told - not shown and its done  uninterestingly by Matt Damon.  The cast would seem better fit for an SNL movie - but here the comedy is groan-worthy.  Also - this movie has very odd product placement.  At one point Matt Damon whips out a bottle of Heinz Ketchup circa 2015 with no explanation why they would leave him with no food but some how be able to have Heinz on board.\r This movie was off the mark in almost every category but it's worst offence was taking an interesting premise and cheapening by having it described through needless narration.  They either thought the demographic was too stupid to understand what was going on - or they wanted to save money by not filming the action.\r TL;DR don't watch this unless you want to see how a movie with a good premise can be rendered utterly mediocre",

But you then have to compensate and calculate the leap years also to which would be 18.75 Leap Years in a 75 year span. To which the total then equals to 657,450 Hours.\r Take into account all the maths I just spoke about and you got an idea of how this movie works on every detail. It truly is the very best parts of MacGyver\u2019s and Burn Notice\u2019s gadget moments rolled into a movie.\r To have just under 3 measly hours take over your life and engross you the entire time does not seem such a feat when compared to those 75 years. But it is. I do not think I blinked much during the course of its 2hrs and 40 minute Runtime.\r During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meagre supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.\r I cannot even fathom touching the surface of how almost flawless this film is. How everything Watney does to stay alive feels real. This all makes sense on a massive, realistic scale. This could be very possible. The science and mathematics they do in this film makes you feel so underwhelmingly minor in the scale of things. I felt extremely stupid for the most part. But it wasn't the type of stupidity I hated. I envied every single moment of it and it kind of made me want to go back and focus in science and math class more than I did. These Scientists that work for the real NASA are genius.\r To think The Martian actually all came from, apparently, an equally amazing book by Peter Weir is even more incredible.\r The scale of its screenplay (written by Drew Goddard of Cabin In The Woods & Daredevil Tv Series) is well above par. It is a fine form of cinema and a brilliant return to form for Ridley Scott.\r I hate movies that waste great characters, funny ones, smart ones, ones that make you say 'I wish we had seen more of them in the film'. But here, every single character is used so well on a scale that works. I cannot say too much about anything in this film. It needs to be experienced before a spoiler talk. Suffice to say, you can see this film in 2D or 3D (I saw it in 2D). The second half of this film, with its outstanding ending, should be a 3D Fever dream. However there is 2 hours roughly, worth of nothing that would come close to a massive 3D experience. So do not worry too much as both options still leave you loving it either choice you make.\r Harry Gregson Williams scores the music and I have to note his work here. In this movie, just as in many of my fave scores (Metal Gear Solid 3 video game and Armageddon movie), it is moving and without it, a lot of Matt Damon\u2019s alone screen time might not have worked the same magic it did.\r Matt Damon really deserves something amazing from this film. To actually invest 3 quarters of a film with nothing but one actor on screen is a hell of an accomplishment. See This Movie! It is one people will be talking about and others will aspire to be like for many years to come.\r 10/10",

The ending was just OK and very abrupt. The worst and most intolerable part was the disco music throughout, that was just so horrible and inexplicable. It ruined the movie for me.  It made no sense at all. This was not a science fiction movie either.

There's not a doubt in my mind. It veryTime for the dreaded \"mixed review\"\r I'll say right now - if you love space movies, Mars, science, astrophysics, NASA, or anything related to these things, this movie will become your new favorite. There's not a doubt in my mind. It very sincerely pushes the boundaries of what films have explained of astronomical science. It does what other movies have not in this regard, I'll absolutely give it that.\r As for me, science was my worst subject, so a lot of the impressiveness this movie simply must contain goes right over my head.\r And yes, I do understand it on the same level I understand a movie like Interstellar, except even more because the physics and the \"botany\" and such is explained on a very personable level. However, it doesn't work for the same reasons Interstellar might not work. The entire movie is an _estimation_ of how you could go about a Mars rescue. That is why people go to see it.\r As a result, there's not much else keeping the movie going except constant scientific explanation. I was definitely expecting something a lot more thrilling going into \"The Martian\", a movie where you have to **** rescue Matt Damon from Mars' deathly atmosphere from thousands of miles away in space. Maybe I'll stick with some other film in that regard, because this one doesn't cut it at all. The tone of the film is a dead giveaway \u2013 Matt Damon will come home safe and that the movie will stretch its own boundaries and possibilities just to make that happen. And I won't give away a big twist in the middle of the movie that makes you doubt it, but in retrospect, even that wasn't good enough to fool me. It was never a matter of \"if\" Matt Damon was gonna come home, it was a matter of when and how. The how was pretty interesting, the when was incredibly tedious.\r Another reason why you might love this movie is that there's lots of character development \u2013 IF YOU'RE A SCIENCE GEEK. As for me, I don't get the characters at all. Matt Damon is supposed to be some kind of hardcore, pushing-the-limits scientist. The other scientists have a billion inside jokes with each other that are completely dumb, but it's supposed to be in an \"aww, their relationships with each other are so adorable\" kind of way. It doesn't work for me at all.\r I know and knew many young people who are into science and are in Harvard and UF and other schools studying this stuff right now. I know they will love this movie because it's custom-tailored to someone who thinks about the stuff the movie talks about all the time. It's for the Neil DeGrasse Tyson generation. It is not for anyone else, as far as I can tell. I did not really enjoy it. There are movies like it already in existence that are better at what they do in every area but the science.\r One more thing: If you think the People's Republic of China's government would actually share a secret with the United States to save one person, you clearly don't know Chinese history. That's probably the most disappointing deus ex machina in film history Reagan0 out.",

The acting was pretty flat, the soundtrack was very flat.\r I feel like someone told the actors that all scientists and engineers are typically emotionless human beings.  All of the NASA interactions in the first half of the moving are just not engaging.  It does pick up in second half and overall I would have been happier with the movie except for the nonsensical end.\r The Good:  Overall the movie was smartly adapted from the book.  I think all of the sections removed were smart decisions that would have taken forever to narrate and been really hard to depict.  Matt Damon did well.  Kristen Wiig did a good job with her character, wish she could have had a little more time.\r The Bad:  The acting and actors.  I don't think Chastain was a great pick for Commander Lewis.  I would have liked to see someone a bit more hard edged.  It seems like Vogel is only German so that he can say Mein Gott instead of My God at one point.  I'm not sure if Jeff Daniels was actually awake.\r The Ugly: The point where Hermes crew finds out Watney's still alive is a huge up of celebration and then a huge down of Lewis admitting she left him behind, and I didn't get any of that at all from the scene.  It just went straight to Lewis being down.  That was a failure of acting and directing.\r Vincent Kapoor instead of Venkat: The long winded explanation of father religion and mother religion then the punchline, which seemed almost whispered, was far less effective than just having the character being Hindu.\r Donald Glover as Danny Pudi's Abed as Rich Purnell.\r The final scene.  Wow was that dumb.  Matt Damon leaps from a spinning capsule after cutting a hole in his suit he can't control.  You can see the thrust going all over the place (like Lewis said it would) and yet he surprisingly stays right on course.  And then of course the hole seals up when it's no longer important and no one seems worried that all of his air is venting to space.  It just flies in the face of a novel that was compelling because it was accurate.  And they didn't have any dumb departures from reality like this the whole movie, then to do it at the end, when it wasn't even necessary or that engaging?\r Overall it was entertaining.  I wouldn't watch it again.",

The acting is phenomenal (Matt Damon is oscar worthy on every level), the cinematography and special effects are beautiful, the writing is excellent and there is some really good tension, humour and drama. This movie is so diverse that Science-Fiction fans will love it, drama fans will love it and just the movie fan in general will love it. The music used in the movie which takes up a great portion of the original soundtrack is from the 80 's; songs like Waterloo from ABBA or Rock the boat from the Hues Corporation really set the tone for this movie. The movie's atmosphere was just so great you just want this movie over and over again. And that brings me to my only little flaw with the movie (this really not a big thing). Which is that the movie's re-watch ability is not that high because the movie is over two hours and it also really feels like a long movie. So when you've already watched this movie you're just going to wait for the parts of the movie you really liked the first time you watched it. The rest of the movie is just a bit boring then, because it's a bit repetitive a times too.

I will never know why they choose him in potential movies. This guy is not for the cinema. He would be better in poster for some fashion agency with some arrogant sullen-looking type of guy. Anyways, if the protagonist was played by different actor like Matthew McConaughey (who have already proofed, that he can make it in space :D) or DiCaprio (who we see can beat even the nature in The Relevant :D). This guy will be good for a role of gym maniac, who is training all day long and is dumb.For the movie I could say, that it has interesting idea. Obviously, a lot of money has been invested and this explains the almost perfect directing. But the soundtrack is not well selected - it's bad. Not just annoying songs, but we have to listen to several attempts with flat jokes, that do not fit the atmosphere at all. If the movie was made a little bit more seriously and if there were no Matt Damon, than it would be maybe 9/10.",

Little did I realize that the trailer was the movie.  Mars is depicted beautifully.  Matt Damon is cracking jokes throughout his ordeal.  Think back Tom Hanks with his volleyball friend Wilson as that is all he had to keep his sanity while he was stranded.  On the other hand Matt Damon thinks of his situation like a huge video game in that he has to be smarter than the average bear.  At no time does the audience not think that he isn't getting back home.  There is no suspense; no sense of urgency; no sense of danger; and that is what takes the movie down.  If you saw Sandra Bullock in the yawn of a movie Gravity where she talks to herself, the The Martian is the same, but this time with Matt Damon in a comedic role which belies all realty.  By the 2nd hour you;re checking your watch asking when this will end.  I'm sorry but when this hits free TV just like Gravity I would never give it a second look.

I love science fiction, and love being at the theater, and consider myself easy enough to please. I'm not a film-scholar, though I do see a lot of movies, and am reasonably aware of film history, genre conventions etc. So, despite some gripes, Gravity (5 score) was watchable in theaters. And despite some gripes, Interstellar (6 score) was watchable in theaters. Which is all I can ask for, and all a block-buster can aim to do. Hold my attention, *or* show me pretty pictures (it doesn't have to be all both), and I'll gladly walk away, less $14.50. You don't even have to stir my heart, or make me think to get my money! This should be so easy, right?\r Wrong. I have two major problems that make The Martian if not un-watchable, certainly not re-watchable, and certainly not worth $14.50 (Gravity and Interstellar I would also consider not re-watchable, but worth $14.50). These gripes (like any) assume that you're like me: an *adult* who sees movies and doesn't appreciate being condescended by studios pushing plush toys made out of hobbits, vampires, GI Joes, barbies, yodas and Will Ferrell. But sill, an adult that (I hope) isn't a douche or \"aficionado\" for dismissing the last fifteen years of mega-frachises (OK, fine, Avatar was way fun, I said it).\r 1). Regarding the look: I have no idea how they messed this up, but it's not particularly pretty. And I'm sentimental for deserts! And I think Mars is so cool! You had me! There just isn't enough Mars in The Martian. The quips are OK, the scientific accuracy is fine (though I honestly don't care one way or the other; I like both versions of sci-fi), the acting is fine, music I don't remember so it must have been fine. Just not nearly enough Mars in a movie with Matt Damon, co-starring, well, Mars.\r 2). Regarding the much acclaimed story: I'm pretty sure Castaway was plotted better, both in the pace, and in outcome. Again, despite some gripes, Castaway dealt very well with the survivor's mental state and desperation, and the very real struggles with personal and cultural re-acclimation upon his return. The Martian is a story for children with no complex character themes. As a result, there was (for me) no real draw or suspense. The secondary crisis (after \"Will he get out alive?\" which is also not very compelling) is  about how his crew might feel if they found out they left him behind, if NASA is morally obligated to tell them, and, if they do feel obligated, when they should tell them. These questions motivate all of the non-Martian-surface drama, and it's boring. I love the idea of crowd sourcing a novel, getting your facts right, and nerding out on the scientific accuracy, but this is a bad plot.\r Bottom line: The Martian isn't pretty enough to compensate for a lackluster story.",

Such a JOKE, From him almost freezing to death and radioacting his brain to stay warm, Then to sticky taping his Fragile Crappy helmet. Every women in NASA is attractive according to Ridley Scott, even the dumb ones sitting in the background have no purpose in the movie, They are just there for the feminists just like in Jurassic  World. There is a brainwashing bit with the black techno guy and the smart attractive NASA blonde where he points at her and says, You are MARS, I think he said it to target the women who want to feel important so they keep watching the crappy movie and buy into stereotyping(Kinda like a control freak.)

First off, I was highly excited to check this film out after reading the book and seeing that Ridley Scott was directing and Matt Damon was starring. And while it certainly met my expectations, it didn't quite exceed them like I had hoped. There was a major plot point or two in the book that was nowhere to be found in the film unfortunately. Also, the ending was slightly tweaked and added on to, but other than that, the rest of the film was entertaining, Damon gave a confident and often times humorous performance (staying true to the nature of his character in the book), and Scott's direction was superb and a great return to form after some of his previous mediocre films (e.g., The Counselor, Exodus.) Overall, I'd say it's definitely worth checking out, even if you haven't read the book.

With Matt Damon in the lead role as Mark Watney, Damon pushes his boundaries as an actor, before he was pretty much the supporting character, but now, he proves that he can carry the movie.\r To sum up; this movie is pretty much like a \"Robinson Crusoe\" or a 'Cast Away' (2000) in space. Watney, along with other astronauts (Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Kate Mara and Sebastian Stan) travel to Mars and he is left for dead when the others do not know what happened to him.\r Obviously, if you've seen the trailer, then you'll know that he is not really dead, we see him stranded in Mars fighting for survival. We see him growing potatoes, making water and trying to contact his crew members and with the rest of the crew on Earth.\r This is a beautifully filmed picture, with some ambitious establishing shots proving how big-scale this movie is. Sometimes you cannot tell whether you are looking at green-screen, or if it might actually be filmed in space/Mars. We see Damon's character trying to cope, physically and emotionally just living in an entire planet all by himself with limited-to-none human contact. The movie also does a good job at teaching how to survive on a planet like Mars, obviously, it is harder than it looks, but you get the idea.\r There is a lot of surprising comic relief in this movie, mostly from Michael Pena's character, who did the same thing when he was in 'Ant-Man' (2015). I was surprised as to how little screen time Jessica Chastain had throughout this movie, but this is Matt Damon's movie, and spending just over two hours with him is good enough.\r I will admit, there were times where I grew a little restless throughout the first two acts of this movie, there are many long stretches and the way it jumps back-and-forth through Matt Damon in space, to the people back at Earth can feel a little choppy.\r But by the time we reach the third act of the movie, that's when the movie starts to get really interesting and that's where the tension rises. Director Ridley Scott is good at building up tension and the music by Harry Gregson-Williams complements the really intense moments throughout the movie.\r Drew Goddard, who also wrote the movie's screenplay (based off the book by Andy Weir), does a magnificent job at crafting clean dialogue without making some of the jokes feel too forced and out of place at times.\r Overall, 'The Martian' is a great movie, proving how great Ridley Scott is as a director and how much of an amazing actor Matt Damon is, he could be seriously considered for an Oscar nomination for his performance. If you are a patient viewer, who didn't mind sitting through films like; 'Cast Away' (2000), '127 Hours' (2010) and 'Life of Pi' (2012), then this will be an unforgettable experience. It's a movie that may not be that entertaining, but it mostly benefits from great acting, and amazing special effects. You will not want to take your eyes off this movie.",
