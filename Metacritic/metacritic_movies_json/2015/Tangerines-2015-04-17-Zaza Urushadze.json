When the war comes to their doorsteps, Ivo (Lembit Ulfsak) takes in two wounded soldiers from opposite sides. The fighters vow to kill each other when they recover, but their extended period of recovery has a humanizing effect that might transcend ethnic divides. Set against a beautiful landscape defiled by war, this poetic film makes an eloquent statement for peace. [Samuel Goldwyn Films]\u2026 Expand",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Tangerines is an example of lean, unadorned old-school filmmaking where familiar style and technique combine to unexpectedly potent effect because of the great skill with which they've been employed.",
        "This remarkable piece of antiwar cinema honors its theme, and the movie medium.",
        "Georgian writer-director Zaza Urushadze avoids histrionics or moralizing, relying on a strong cast that expresses the film\u2019s central argument about war\u2019s absurdity largely through taciturn action, not words.",
        "Although events unfold amid a gorgeous pastoral setting with rolling green hills and leafy trees, there is a silent starkness about this countryside that suggests Ingmar Bergman\u2019s use of natural surroundings.",
        "Ivo\u2019s farmhouse looks leftover from another century, which gives a timeless feeling, as does the regal bearing of Ulfsak and the dry humor of the script. The film telegraphs its pacifist message early on, but it\u2019s still deeply affecting.",
        "With nearly five-decade screen veteran Ulfsak setting the wry, soulful tenor, Tangerines balances humor and seriousness in deft fashion, its delicacy abetted by all thesps and design contributions.",
        "The film turns out to be highly effective, thanks to the skills of the actors and director Zaza Urushadze.",
        "Its impact sealed by across-the-board strong performances from its all-male cast, Tangerines is a film about loss and belonging, about rootedness and departure.",
        "The alliances of the characters are a tad confusing at the beginning, but you don\u2019t have to be an expert in geopolitics to appreciate the finer points of director Zaza Urushadze\u2019s intimate film, which was nominated for a best foreign film Oscar.",
        "A simple tale, sharply drawn and smartly told, a portrait of a people, a place and a centuries-old conflict that this wise yet myopic citrus farmer cannot get his mind around any more than we can.",
        "The film, beautifully shot and cleanly edited, has the economy of a short story, unfolding in a mood of slightly sentimental masculine stoicism.",
        "Interior scenes focus theater-like on the dining room table-as-vortex: Threats and insults whip about, but, finally, so do forays of friendship.",
        "There are some touching interactions between the players, but the film\u2019s humanism is too predictably calibrated.",
        "War is brutal and senseless and would be laughably absurd if it didn\u2019t cause so much widespread, unnecessary destruction and suffering. Tangerines is a heartfelt reminder of that fact, but not a particularly essential one.",
        "Urushadze\u2019s excellent cast imbues their thinly drawn characters with a great deal of life, but the roles are so transparent that the film feels like more of an advertisement for peace than it does an argument for it.",
        "Too blunt and didactic to convey the futility of war with the complexity the subject demands, Tangerines works primarily as a showcase for its trio of lead actors, who work hard to make their characters\u2019 gradual yet quick thaw seem not just credible, but inevitable.",
        "The shift from philosophical parrying to actual combat doesn\u2019t make Tangerines more compelling; on the contrary, it suggests that the filmmakers didn\u2019t have the confidence to tell their story without falling back on genre tropes.",
        "For all of the potential, historically specific revelations regarding nation and religion, Tangerines elects to become bathetic hokum."
