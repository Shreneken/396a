  "critic_reviews": [
    "The movie rarely, if ever, feels mechanical. Instead, you may find yourself marveling at the fertility of an imagination that could allow itself to toss so many vivid characters and stories—enough to supply four or five movies — into one generous package.",
    "Deserves to become a serious art-house hit in the U.S. thanks to its skill in deftly overcoming the form’s usual deficits, for a result that feels as amazingly cohesive as it is relentlessly clever and entertaining.",
    "Beyond being very smart and funny, it's also a great looking movie.",
    "While adhering to an internal logic that makes each punchline land with a satisfying burst of glee, the movie nevertheless stems from genuine fury aimed a broken world. It's the rare storytelling endeavor that manages to be laughably absurd and profoundly tragic at the same time.",
    "Wild Tales represents the work of an exceedingly skillful storyteller.",
    "Wild Tales is loose-limbed, rowdy, and exhilarating — in its vibrant lunacy, and with its cartoonishly brash violence, it's a little bit Almodóvar, a little bit Tarantino.",
    "Snap! That’s the crack of people teetering on the verge in each of the six segments in the perversely entertaining Argentinian film Wild Tales, a more-than-deserving recent Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language film.",
    "Madly entertaining and just plain mad.",
    "Wild Tales rockets along with sleek, amoral charm and a masterful sense of cinematic storytelling; it’s worth noting that one of the producers is Spain’s Pedro Almodóvar.",
    "Szifrón handles the tone and presentation masterfully.",
    "Writer-director Damián Szifron hasn't made one film — he's made six, stitched together under one title and sent out to a world that may not be ready. Screw the pussies. Wild Tales is gleefully out for blood.",
    "Imagine all of D-Fens’ fury in Falling Down squeezed into one short, then times it by six. A gloriously crazed compendium that fizzes with OMG and OTT moments.",
    "This is really entertaining stuff. It requires the ability to laugh at misfortune, but Szifrón is so skilled in his writing and direction that this isn't a problem.",
    "Grudges, minor insults and found-out flirtations lead to mayhem and murder on a cataclysmic scale.",
    "The direct translation of this deliciously devilish film’s Spanish title is “Savage Stories.” That’s a more fitting title.",
    "Szifron does a terrific job of pacing thanks to expert editing (he shares credit with Pablo Barbieri) within each episode and a genuinely subversive sense of humor.",
    "The infectious dark comedy Wild Tales (Relatos salvajes) argues that payback is more satisfying when it’s doled out in fiery, bloody and outrageous doses.",
    "What really distinguishes it from the art-film crowd is that it’s also food-spittingly funny.",
    "If everyone behaved the way the characters in Wild Tales behave, civilization would crumble. But the real take-away lesson here is how easy it might be for any of us, swept up in a moment of bloodlust, to consider pure raging hostility a fair trade.",
    "If you’ve ever fantasized about busting up somebody’s nuptials, this movie is for you.",
    "Damián Szifron’s Wild Tales almost feels too audacious, too crazy, and, in some ways, too slight for the Oscars.",
    "The filmmakers have cannily structured this crazed collection of shorts, using running time and general quality as organizational criteria. The best segments serve as bookends. The worst ones are buried in the middle.",
    "The film is nominated for this year’s Best Foreign Film Oscar, and it doesn’t deserve to snatch the prize from the towering likes of “Ida,” “Timbuktu” or “Leviathan.” Yet in its gaudy, predictable way, Wild Tales is enormous fun, and the consistent wit of the quiet stretches shows there’s more to Szifrón than shock tactics.",
    "Each of the six vignettes that make up this unusually energetic anthology pertains to the methods of calculated mass dehumanization that are (barely) hidden beneath the practices of social institutions.",
    "It's crisply and cleanly shot throughout, and the filmmaker shows a rare feel for how to not only make comedy land, but also to make it actually feel cinematic too.",
    "Whatever the style, the point is blunt, reductive: Civilized humans can transform, in an instant, into blindingly destructive forces of nature. Not exactly an original thesis, but as a source of movie fodder, it’s scarily entertaining.",
    "Mr. Szifron creates inhabited worlds with comic timing and visual flair, but you can hear him chortling as he shovels his people into the grinder.",
    "There’s a good deal of the sick-and-twisted element of The ABCs Of Death here, but managed with better pacing, more maturity, and more room to build each segment.",
    "Wild Tales opens and closes with a bang, and at its best is a riotously funny and cathartic exorcism of the frustrations of contemporary life.",
    "Vengeance has powered countless movies over the years, but rarely can it have been given such a thorough – and thoroughly entertaining – showcase as it gets in Wild Tales.",
    "As we pass from one story to another the relentless savagery does get a bit grinding. In addition, at two hours in length, Szifron's film is perhaps one skit too long. Regardless, Wild Tales is an inventive, occasionally hysterical ride.",
    "You never lose interest for a moment, and the images are often striking: Javier Julia did the stylish cinematography. Yet there’s little lift from the carryings-on, not much buoyancy in the misanthropy.",
    "Revenge may be a dish best served cold, but Argentine writer-director Damián Szifron allows it to sit until it congeals in the dreary six-part anthology Wild Tales."

One of the nominees for Best Foreign Film, and deservedly so, the film consists of 6 independent stories threaded together by the theme of revenge and retribution. From the tale of an angry lover whose mate has been unfaithful to the story of  a citizen frustrated by government corruption and  four other stories in between, these are tales woven together by a masterful story teller in the person of Senor Szifron. Superbly acted, photographed, written and directed, this film stands out as one of the most enjoyable theatrical experiences this viewer has had the pleasure of being part of in a long long time. It is no easy feat to be able to tie so many individual tales in such a way that the viewer never feels he or she is watching separate films but, instead, one large overview of the human condition and how we each cope with the circumstances that befall us. I give the film a 10 4 s and urge all who can to make it a must-see on their movie list..",

I didn’t like all the “tales” equally, but they all held my interest and made me laugh, regardless of the cruelty inflicted in some of them as people went wildly out of control. The subjects satirized were contemporary and apparently are common to everyone all over the world – and these situations were not as trivial and juvenile as in many American comedies, which seem to be mainly about hangovers and acting stupidly. In this film, people made fools of themselves for good reason, even if, of course, their reactions were just a bit exaggerated. The comic acting was great.",

I was completely floored by the originality of the movie, both its format and its stories themselves.  It's arranged into a series of short stories centred around a small number of characters, and they're all these gorgeous little morality plays.  The stories tend to start with a perfectly normal scene and set of events--small talk between two strangers on a plane, or a man buying a birthday cake--and some kind of twist happens to take it into the unexpected, to make the tale wild, as the title suggests., as some normal situation gets completely out of hand.  Some stories have several twists to keep you guessing.  There are so many amazing moments of tension and surprise, sometimes funny and sometimes just so shocking that you have to laugh.  A wonderful, hilarious, and incredibly fun and original movie.",

The firstThis collection of six short stories is generally very entertaining but stops short of being truly great due to a couple of the longer instalments (number 4 and 5) over indulging their content. The first 2 stories are really short. The first set on a plane is frighteningly topical, unintentionally echoing events surrounding the recent tragedy in the French Alps. All the tales are about revenge of some sort or another and whilst the film is not often laugh out loud funny there is definitely a rich vein of black humour coursing through its veins. The best of the episodes involves two drivers who get caught up in violence and death following a road rage encounter. This story is very humorous and yet contains a lot of tension. It is undoubtedly the highlight. The last tale concerns a bride and groom who come to blows at their own wedding reception. This episode is also very successful at combining drama with black comedy and despite the story’s arc, which could have come over as really contrived, the episode works marvellously. There is a great use of music throughout and were it not for the over indulgent ‘Falling Down’ sequence and the least entertaining ‘Hit and Run’ episode, these original tales would be worth an 8 of anyone’s ratings.",

The anthology consists of 6 wild tales of vengeance that are thematically similar but have different narratives.

I was hooked from the audacious opening scene of people boarding a plane and noticing that something has gone terribly wrong; if you've seen the film you will know what I'm talking about. My favorite tale has to be the road rage bit because it escalates so quickly and it was edge of your seat entertainment. My second favorite is the last tale that takes place at a wedding; it starts off cheerful then takes a left turn and becomes the most memorable wedding. This style of film making should be encouraged because in modern cinema people won't appreciate a movie because it takes too long to build up or most viewers will not have the patience to sit through a thought provoking, slow paced film.
