When five young men translated their experiences growing up into brutally honest music that rebelled against abusive authority, they gave an explosive voice to a silenced generation.  Following the meteoric rise and fall of N.W.A., Straight Outta Compton tells the astonishing story of how these young men revolutionized music and pop culture forever the moment they told the world the truth about life in the hood and ignited a cultural war.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "Straight Outta Compton is among the most potent rags-to-riches showbiz movies ever made.",
    "It plays like a Marvel superhero movie had Marvel been run by Suge Knight.",
    "Within the vigorous entertainment of Straight Outta Compton is a sharp-minded realism about the machines within the machines, the amplifiers of money and media that, behind the scenes and offscreen, play crucial roles in the flow of power.",
    "If “Compton” is undeniably of the moment, it’s also timeless in its depiction of how artists and writers transform the world around them into angry, profane, vibrant and singular personal expression.",
    "Besides the movie’s weight in our contemporary, post-Ferguson historical moment, Straight Outta Compton may also be the funniest, most exhilarating and flat-out best Hollywood movie of the summer.",
    "Straight Outta Compton plays better when it's outside the box, showing us N.W.A power and the consequences of abusing it. Would the movie be better if it didn't sidestep the band's misogyny, gay-bashing and malicious infighting? No shit. But what stands is an amazement, an electrifying piece of hip-hop history that speaks urgently to right now.",
    "Credit goes to smart casting of unknowns in the leads, who click uniformly; a packed script that manages not to feel overly long and social commentary that is timeless.",
    "One of the summer’s most entertaining and provocative movies.",
    "This is one of the better musical biopics of the last 20 years.",
    "More interesting than the hows and whys of N.W.A.'s controversial rise and fall in the industry are the inside snapshots of the industry itself, from grimy Compton clubs to electrifying arena concerts to hotel orgies to studio sessions that illuminate Dr. Dre's creative process.",
    "Straight Outta Compton is a hugely entertaining film that works best if you don’t look at it too closely and just listen.",
    "Both of its time and of the moment, Straight Outta Compton is potent and largely successful, and makes a hell of a case for why this was a story worth telling.",
    "Straight Outta Compton proves as infectiously entertaining as it is educational thanks to F. Gary Gray's richly textured direction and a thumping soundtrack that confirms rap as the protest music of its time.",
    "Potent and visceral in its depiction of street life and blinged-up excess alike, Straight Outta Compton delivers big beats of both kinds.",
    "Straight Outta Compton is, undoubtedly, a nostalgia trip, but, this being NWA, it’s one you take in a ’64 Impala with height-adjustable suspension. It’s a loud, stylish ride.",
    "A sprawling, overstuffed, formulaic but highly entertaining story of pop stardom.",
    "No movie could capture all the alarming incidents and contradictions that make up the complete N.W.A. story. But in order to stress the group’s most righteous side, the movie downplays their youthful excesses as well as their flagrant sexism.",
    "Buoyed by a soundtrack that’ll have fortysomethings cracking open 40-ounces and recalling a marginally simpler, if still chaotic, time in their lives, Straight Outta Compton’s bark is just as snarly-cool as its bite. Take that, Tipper Gore.",
    "Even with the film’s mild flaws and arms-wide-open approach, it tells a powerful, engaging and compelling story of how America challenged and changed five young black men, and how they in turn challenged and changed America.",
    "Straight Outta Compton reminds viewers not only who N.W.A. were and what they meant, but also why they mattered — and still do.",
    "It's overlong and sanitized but succeeds in presenting an important part of contemporary American culture to a mainstream audience.",
    "Now in middle age, members of N.W.A. no longer believe all of the hype. They’re in an introspective space, to the great benefit of this film.",
    "It all adds up to a terrific, if biased on the side of the winners (Dre and Cube) history lesson, and a thoroughly compelling, very American and utterly modern musical biography.",
    "The performances are terrific, and when it’s on its game, which is often, Straight Outta Compton is an explosive look at the creation of a message that had to be delivered by the only people who could deliver it, a message that is, unfortunately, as timely now as when we first heard it.",
    "Despite Straight Outta Compton’s energetic acting and Gray’s capture of in-studio Eureka! moments, it never manages to transcend biopic hagiography, with characters whose names appear in the production credits – Dre, Cube and Eazy-E’s widow Tomica Woods-Wright – faring best onscreen.",
    "If the movie pushes most of the ugliest behavior off onto side players (like the notorious Suge Knight, played by R. Marcus Taylor), it does for the most part fulfill its mission, breathing life into the origin story of a group whose influence is still being felt.",
    "Straight Outta Compton, while often entertaining and dynamic, ultimately feels as if its meant to act as a kind of cinematic trophy to rest on a pedestal that celebrates not only N.W.A., but the successful and trailblazing members who helped define hip hop outside of the group.",
    "It’s biopic syndrome, this impulse to condense events to hit the high notes, to provide fans with recognizable stories, to essentially act as a greatest hits album, and it sinks the second half of an otherwise compelling, funny and extremely entertaining film with a beat all its own.",
    "F. Gary Gray’s Straight Outta Compton starts out strong, peaks quickly, and then gets tangled in complications and compromise and falls apart.",
    "When the songs themselves take center stage the movie works. What remains in the wings constitutes another, fuller story.",
    "It's most towering accomplishment are its set pieces, which manage to be brash, exhilarating, and even occasionally moving.",
    "Straight Outta Compton soars for an hour before spiralling into a bloated, melodramatic mess. Still, it’s worth it for the early ferocity, capturing just how powerful N.W.A really were.",
    "Straight Outta Compton doesn't shy entirely from the uglier side of the N.W.A. story, including the claims that their music and their lifestyles glorified thug life, perpetuated gun violence, advocated drug use and reveled in misogyny. Instead, Gray's film owns it.",
    "Alternately riveting and wearying, up-to-the-minute relevant as well as self-mythologizingly self-indulgent — as much of a heroic origins story as anything out of the Marvel factory — Straight Outta Compton ends up juggling more story lines and moods than it can handle.",
    "The partying is as bland as any all-purpose music video and feels more like another script signpost (and audience-pandering) than a serious attempt to get out what it means to be young, black, gifted, fabulously wealthy and much desired. Mr. Gray does far better when the story edges into heavier, more dappled realms.",
    "There’s way too much inside-baseball money talk here, when a simpler plot—one about a band whose apocalyptic vision comes to pass—would have been plenty.",
    "The first half of Straight Outta Compton, F Gary Gray’s two-and-a-half hour opus about the birth of west coast gangsta rap, is bursting with energy, exuberance and inspiration. The second half is immobilised by bloat and sanctification.",
    "Despite a twisty, juicy and compelling story, there remains a staid conventionality that keeps the political and thematic undercurrents from being explored as satisfyingly as one might hope.",
    "With a running time of 147 minutes, the film not only runs low on energy toward the end — internecine battles can’t compete with the early excitement of gifted young kids making it big on a national stage — but turns ploddingly sentimental in its sudden focus on Eazy-E’s painful decline, and death, from AIDS.",
    "Aside from these few flourishes of the outré and symbolically charged, there’s little to distinguish the movie from any number of overlong hit-by-hit music biopics of the nodding-approvingly-from-behind-a-mixing-console variety.",
    "It's clear that Straight Outta Compton is at once too padded and too thin. It's as if the story of these real-life legends was so unruly and dangerous that the filmmakers became the cops, forcing it into submission."

What I got was a well executed biopic whichWhen I went into the cinema to see Straight Outta Compton I was expecting a film which glamorised the gangsta rap lifestyle with lavish parties which featured excessive violence, sex and drug use. What I got was a well executed biopic which looks at the rise and fall of one of most influential rap groups in American history.\r The film is more than an standard biopic, it deals with themes that are bigger than N.W.A. Police brutality/racism is a common theme throughout the film. One scene where the group are harassed by police for simply standing outside there recording studio highlights how tough it was to be a young African American at the time. Sadly it reminds the audience how nothing has really changed in the last 25 years for this portion of the American demographic. The other theme's the film delves into are greed, gang violence and betrayal.\r The cast is headed by three very talented young actor's, O'Shea Jackson Jr, Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell play Ice Cube, Dr Dre & Eazy E with ease and style, Paul Giamatti as Jerry Heller is excellently cast and proves why he s one of the best actor's of his generation.\r The film isn't perfect as it struggles from pacing issue's throughout but overall director F. Gary Gray achieves a decent film which is made better by the performances of it's actors. This is a large improvement for F.Gary Gray as some of previous films such as The Italian Job remake and Be Cool will not be remembered as fondly as Straight Outta Compton.",

This movie makes Eazy-E look like a whiny, angry, annoying **** who fell down after Dr. Dre and Ice Cube left Ruthless Records when that was never the case. What I've got to say is that this movie goes out of its way to glorify Ice Cube and Dr. Dre while making Eazy-E look like a failure. This is likely due to the fact that Ice Cube and Dr. Dre produced this movie. Nonetheless, it's still an entertaining movie and I would recommend it as a movie, not as an accurate depiction of what did happen with N.W.A from 1986-1995.",

This group suffered from drug abuse, sexual assault, battery towards woman, and violence. Interesting how they forgot to put those in, making these guys look like heroes. Pioneers in the music scene yes but heroes they are not.  Eazy E suffered from drug addiction to Cocaine, X, LSD, Crack, amongst many others including being a drunk 100% of the time. Dr Dre was charged several times with assault including beating up a waitress and getting charged for beating up his ex girlfriend. Ice Cube growing up with strict parents and becoming a dedicated father in the early 90's This truth never came up, was ignored and sadly the people will never experienced the real truth as to why this group fell apart. Watching it was hilarious how they keet ignoring the real truths scene after scene. Showing Eazy E and Dre treating woman so kindly and never once doing drugs. Please I wanted to see the GRIT and the REAL people these men were. Dre is a different man now and Cube grew up faster than all. This would have been a more powerful story showing how they grew up rather than ignoring the pain and trouble they were facing personally.",

Besides the music, the acting is also surprisingly good, as all of the actors are given moments to shine. My biggest complaint is the portrayal of police in the film, I understand that a large majority of police in Los Angeles were corrupt, but not every cop was a racist pig, I think the racist cops would have been even more resonating if we saw a normal cop every once and a while, not just a bunch of growling, racist, asses. In essence Straight Outta Compton is a funny, well acted, engrossing, music jam fest, that chronicles one of the more important rap groups of all time, but could have layed off of the stereotypes.",

When NWA broke into the scene unapologetically spitting rhymes about the brutality of the streets they lived on,It may be hard to believe but “hardcore” Rap wasn’t always all about all the Bling-Bling or the size of your girl’s rear-end. When NWA broke into the scene unapologetically spitting rhymes about the brutality of the streets they lived on, “Gangsta Rap” was effectively born, which then gave birth to a string of early 90s gritty “ghetto” dramas like ‘Boyz n the Hood’ and ‘Menace II Society,‘ with their unglamorized depictions of young black Americans growing up in the most deprived areas in the USA.\r With ‘Straight Outta Compton’, director F. Gary Gray (Friday, Law Abiding Citizen) manages to effectively combine the harsh nature of these early 90s “Hood” dramas with the core elements of a dramatized contemporary-culture biopic, to build what is essentially a modern “American Dream” human drama, after all NWA members Ice Cube and Dr. Dre went from struggling poor teenagers in gang-dominated South Central L.A. to global music superstars and eventually multi-millionaire media-moguls.\r The story in ‘Straight Outta Compton’ is more extraordinary than fiction despite being “dramatized”, but the performances are the stars of the show, particular praise must be given to Ice Cube’s own son O’Shea Jackson Jr. who very convincingly plays his old man and Jason Mitchell for effectively capturing the essence of the late Eazy-E.\r Despite the novelty of being a Rap and urban-drama real story, ‘Straight Outta Compton’ walks a very similar and well-trodden path that most music Biopics seem to follow, complete with strategically placed moments of pathos and grief, perhaps the most disappointing element is the depiction of the group members as heroes of the piece taking little responsibility for their actions and those of the “villains” around them, not surprising since the movie is produced and effectively helmed by Ice Cube and Dr. Dre themselves.\r For its shortcomings, ‘Straight Outta Compton’ is a compelling watch and as good as any recent music biopic, albeit in a sub-genre that is often disappointing, the most striking theme of the film is that of police brutality and the systemic oppression of ethnic minorities in the USA… and although it should not be an excuse for callous and subversive behaviour, it does highlight an issue which remains as prevalent today as in the early days of NWA.\r The Bottom Line…\rWhile it’s confined by the predictable limitations of the music biopic genre, ‘Straight Outta Compton’ is an effectively crafted “ghetto” drama based on a true-story more extraordinary than fiction which manages to retain its social relevance.",

They generally do not in the line of duty, and if they did it would be highly unprofessional.  Sure, certain ones must sometimes and especially in the ghettos of this movie but at a certain point when every single line from officers is F this, F that such as in the first arrest scene by the Compton police as depicted in this film, one loses the suspension of disbelief.  And this is a true story!  The gangsta rappers talk that way, but don't believe the hype when they twist it onto the police.  In the scene with the Torrance police the same thing, every single line out of the cops' mouths has F whatever.  Then ironically in the LAPD chopper arrest scene later there's no profanity from the police.  So what are the filmmakers saying, LAPD don't swear during intense arrests but the other local agencies do?  Movies are ALL editorial and everything can either be made very accurate or very carefully manipulated to make a point.  Or they can just be half ass and sloppy about both the truth and the point they are trying to make, which is what this movie is much of the time.\rA fairly large canvas that rips off scenes straight outta \"The Doors\" (which was maybe the first L.A. supergroup contrary to the film's bit from the media claiming NWA as that, and they were going 20 years later!) but without Stone's masterful power.  For that matter this movie is the same rags to riches musical story as \"Jersey Boys\" was from last year but also without nearly the emotion and finesse that film had from master director Eastwood.  This film is a fairly competent noble attempt but proves ultimately a soulless run through with an overly long running time.  If it had half the energy the end credits have it might have been above the fray.",

You can tell that the leads were fans of the source material. O'Shea Jackson Jr, playing his real life father Ice Cube in the film, was especially good and stood out from the rest. The film itself is fascinating and at times far more humorous than I expected it to be. Some will go into the film assuming it is dark and violent and while it certainly doesn't pull any punches, it has more heart and at times has a  lighter tone than you'd think. The soundtrack is obviously top notch and well crafted. It didn't simply play N.W.A.'s greatest hits, but also timed them well and showcased a lot of solo material throughout the movie. A great love letter to the group and something that fans of N.W.A.'s music will be proud of.\r The Bad: If you're  not a fan of N.W.A., then you won't like it nearly as much. You'll still be entertained to an extent, but it won't grab you like it would someone who grew up with the music. Some moments of their career was glossed over somewhat and I would have liked to seen more of their rise than is shown. MC Ren, a founding member of the group, is completely under-represented and fades into the background even more so as the film chugs along. I understand that Dre, Ice Cube, and Eazy had titanic solo careers, but Ren was one of the driving forces behind the group and the chief rapper on a lot of their tracks. It's a shame that he didn't quite get the credit he deserves.",

It shows the harsh world that they grew up in and the mistreatment by the police, and in return, N.W.A. 's I-dont-care attitude. I would say it needed all the language, have you heard any N.W.A. song? If you're going to make a movie about artists, the least you could do is preserve their artistic intentions, which were to show a harsh reality through harsh language and lyrics. The women, drugs, violence, all of that just melds together with the emotionally gripping story and the end product is pure cinema gold.

Gary Gray's tribute to the rap gods, N.W.A is not only hard hitting and brutal, but extremely knowlagble and executed with almost no flaw. Straight Outta Compton hits every note, every line, every heartbeat and every rhythm. It is truly a masterpiece and a golden piece of cinema for ages to come. SOC tells the story of 3 guys out of a racist and judgemental, also incredibly violent neighbourhood, which is putting people under the influence of drugs and crime. Easily put, this is not a very pleasant place. But, they don't give up their hopes, and overcome tough situations to become rap stars with music that many found vulgar and obscene at the time. We are talking about the superstars, Ice Cube, the late Eazy E, and Dr. Dre. You might not believe it, but this is a true story, these acts of random violence, the cruel neighbourhood, the drug dealing, the every insult that they had to endure, happened. Personally, I thought Gary Gray's take on the Watts riots was deep and thoughtful. Another thing that I loved was putting younger version of hip hop artists that we know today, it really is a blast from the past. Compton was recreated so realistic at the time than ever. Suge Knight was well represented as well. Jason Mitchell and O'Shea Jackson Jr were brilliant. And Paul Gimmati as Jerry Heller didn't damn disappoint. Don't worry, there are sprinkles of black comedy here that are available for your taste. It's not fully serious, it likes to laugh a bit as well. Another thing that people should know is that this was not a easy film to make, Gary Gray and his team ran into some trouble while filming in Compton, California and presenting a film like this may get some backlash. But the risk was worth it, Straight Outta Compton is one of the best biopics of this century, it stands between a message of brutal racism and a life story of true artists. Oh! Did I forget about the music? Jaw dropping. Everyone had fun and were singing along, including myself. Well, there you have it, it may be hard finding another masterpiece in 2015. Don't you damn miss it.",

Mitchell brought a lot of emotional depth to the role, and made it a performance for the ages. But that's not the only standout. Director F.

Before then Gray really only knew how to make moderately entertaining movies. Here, you could tell that this was a passion project for him. And he pulled it off with spades. It was a great history lesson without feeling like a history lesson. You could tell that in the movie, there were things that they did not hold back; which make for a much more entertaining experience. The last act of the movie may not be as strong as the first two, but there are still terrific scenes in there. There were some cameos. Some good, one in particular (for me) was ridiculous and I personally didn't buy it. Also, there was one character introduced about halfway through the movie who was nothing more than a clear antagonist. His performance was fine but he came off as one-dimensional. But overall, this was a fun, emotional and crazy biopic. If you haven't seen it and want to learn more about N.W.A. Go see it. I give it an A-!

I also think they avoided the Eazy E, Dr Dre beef for some reason. At times the movie feels rushed, and other times moves a bit slow, giving it a bit of a jumbled feel.\rStill, if you are a fan, it is a good watch.

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nEmerging from Compton, Los Angeles in the mid-1980s, NWA revolutionised rap culture with their music and tales about life on the streets. This biopic, directed by F. Gary Gray, is more relevant today than ever. Black artists expressing themselves in a time of police brutality, harassment, media spin, social unrest, it's scary how it all mirrors recent events. It's not all a sociopolitical commentary though, it's about the art of young men who dreamt of bigger things, the early days of laying down beats in the bedroom, the first gig, the recording sessions. And then the fame and fortune, the sex and drugs, the threats and violence.\r A lot of ground is covered in the 2 hours and 27 minutes runtime: Eazy-E meeting Dr Dre and Ice Cube, the recording of Straight Outta Compton, the touring and FBI threats, the breakup of NWA, Cube's solo success, Dre signing with Suge Knight's Death Row records and the fallout, working with Snoop Dogg and Tupac, Eazy's death from AIDs. The film picks up in speed and left me asking for a slower pace, mainly in the second half. It's annoying that melodrama is favoured instead of real incidents swept to the side: Dre's violent encounter with a woman journalist, Eazy E's diss track about Dre, Cube's and Dre's music that was influenced by the LA Riots (although the Rodney King trial and riots are played out in the background). Even if all that was included, there would still be those complaints of \"Ah but what about the misogyny! And the homophobic lyrics!?\" etc. It's a tough and complex task, but what's here is what matters the most: the relationships and the music.\r The performances of Ice Cube (played by his son O'Shea Jackson Jr), Dr Dre (Corey Hawkins), MC Ren (Aldis Hodge), Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr) cannot be faulted. Each one dishes out pulsating rage and energy throughout, from the desperate hard times to the excessive good times. These young men have come out of nowhere to carry this film with their chemistry and it's impressive, especially Corey Hawkins who is (only slightly) the standout. Paul Giamatti plays their shady manager Jerry Heller, who is at the core of the conflict and mistrust that engulfs the band later on.\r The soundtrack, mostly NWA material and tracks from Dr Dre's new release 'Compton', keeps the action and drama together at all times. Live performances of their classic anthems like Straight Outta Compton or the studio session for **** The Police as the band hits their groove, it's all seamless and entertaining. This is obviously coming from a fan of the music, how non rap fans will react is for someone else to review!\r Although not perfect and history being tweaked to appeal to a larger audience, barring sequels and franchise blockbusters, Straight Outta Compton is one of the best films of the year so far.",

Aside from production they manage to tell their story very well with the very clear and obvious limitations and time constraints you have to a movie. The movie is a bit long though, I can't say exact time but I think probably 3 hours.

Next, critic who was annoyed at police constantly shouting the F word, thinking they don't generally do this and if they do it's unprofessional.  My response to this also addresses criticisms of the movie in general.  Many just MISS THE POINT.  It's \"Biopic\" so it's reflective of their environment (not yours probably) and their experiences with the police.  What's commendable is that even those these guys were surrounded by gang bangers, poverty, the new Jim Crow, etc., (some might say By Design)  they chose another path.  Too bad for anyone who leaves the movie after 45 minutes as you again MISS THE POINT.  Ironic that some thought it was too long, others felt it was short - missing a lot.  It did leave out a lot, but I wouldn't want everything I did at age 21 on a wide screen either.  After seeing a Dr. Dre documentary, I believe his apology (at age 51) to women.  Since there are so many stories that could be told of this era, maybe we'll be blessed with a Straight Outta Compton 2 !!!",

An authentic look at NWA and the hype surrounding them, the film works as both a biopic and as a drama. The acting, from a relatively unknown cast, is great. O'Shea Jackson Jr, Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, R. Marcos Taylor, and Keith Stanfield, all stood out in particular. Though very negative towards the police, the film does a very good job presenting the film from the viewpoint of our, admittedly, biased narrators. That is not to say I doubt the authenticity of the film at all though, because cops can certainly be racist, especially in Los Angeles. Overall, Straight Outta Compton is an expertly made film by director F. Gary Gray and presents Hollywood with a number of very talented black actors to now start casting in future films hopefully. Entertaining, well directed, well written, and well acted, Straight Outta Compton is never great, but certainly met my expectations. Oh and the music is awesome, of course.",

The first half was the reason which was very negatively appealed, particularly the racism and police abuse preoccupied rather than telling the actual story. But the next half was much better. I liked it because of that part which crafted so brilliantly. That's where the real journey begins. Well played characters, everybody who repressed those real ones were done incredible job.\r This film revealed something I did know. Like how the Rap music got so popular. I quite belong to the same generation where this thing got its revolution. It was like another 'Lords of Dogtown' where the young guys made skateboards popular, but here it was the Rap songs. It was a two and half hour long film, longer than an average film length, but the pace was good. Except the strong contents, the narration never looked dull. I totally enjoyed watching it, a good film for adults, particularly those who love Rap music must not think of missing it.\r 7/10",

And I hope that the storytelling and the lessons in this movie could inspire people to be better people and not just view rap the way it is commonly perceived today.\r other than that, fk Suge Knight.\rWorth watching but watch with a teachable heart and not a prejudiced one. You aint judge Judy and not all stereotypes are 100% true.",

Now, this film is amazing, I was happy to watch a film with a lot of emotion and a lot realistic theme of the life of their day by day as the film shows you what they went through to get to where they got to when they rose in popularity. The Casting for the film was perfect, you really couldn't ask for anything better, Ice Cube played by his own son O'Shea Jackson Jr., Dr. Dre played by Corey Hawkins, Easy-E played Jason Mitchell, DJ Yella played Neil Brown Jr., and MC Ren played by Aldis Hodge, with the addition of Paul Giamatti as the band's manager Jerry Heller. They nailed the soundtrack as they used original audio by the real members and re-recordings by the actors throughout their performances. The story of the film was was written by Ice Cube and Dr. Dre themselves, which they did a great job, but the film had a problem with the the fact that the 1st half of the film was very fast-paced and intense, but when it got to the 2nd half of the film, the story got more serious, and started to really slow down, and it was good, but it just slowed down too quick. Overall, Straight Outta Compton is a almost perfect and amazing film that will be praised for decades to come for raw emotion and for it's intense and unbelievable story.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nDespite having all the makings of a classic, Straight Outta Compton doesn’t quite deliver on the promise of its subject matter. The rags-to-riches narrative surrounding the self-proclaimed “world’s most dangerous group” plays out less like a gritty historical account and more of a Hollywood glorification of real events.\r The film is bolstered by nostalgic performances from its actors. Each of the group's members are well cast, most notably Ice Cube (played by O'Shea Jackson Jr.), who bears a striking resemblance to the veteran rapper in his day. The best acting arguably comes from Jason Mitchell (as Eazy-E) and Paul Giamatti (as Jerry Heller), both of whom show good range and presence. The characters of MC Ren and DJ Yella are left to the background, which was to be expected and is justified from a directorial and writing standpoint.\r It’s also worth mentioning the opening sequence, in which Eazy-E confronts a group of drug dealers who are indebted to him. Things gradually escalate, culminating in a raid by the L.A.P.D. which Eazy narrowly escapes. This perfectly sets the tone of the movie and makes for thrilling viewing.\r Unfortunately, many events are either glossed over or misrepresented. The solo careers of Dr. Dre and Ice Cube are both included in the plot, yet Eazy-E’s is sorely missing - his diss track aimed towards Dr. Dre and Death Row Records, Real Muthaphukkin G’s, was a milestone for Eazy, as it revealed his individual abilities as a writer, and a landmark of the era. Instead, we are only shown the bitter end to Eazy’s relationship with Heller. Although this works in the scheme of the film, it also undermines its authenticity, and considering the high regard in which Eazy is held today, many will see this as a cop out.\r One scene depicts Dr. Dre - apparently having lost his temper at Suge Knight - get into a high speed chase with police. This is based on an incident that happened in 1994, however Dre was actually arrested for drunk driving. Following Dre’s departure from the group, Eazy-E is shown tearfully admiring a billboard for Dre’s album The Chronic, when in fact the album featured many tracks that dissed Eazy, and the two were in a well-publicized feud at the time. While the film’s writers are allowed some artistic license, these unnecessary alterations give a distorted impression of real events and a disingenuous portrayal of the characters.\r The movie is further weighed down by uneven writing. When Ice Cube is introduced, his school bus is held up by gun-toting Crenshaw Mafia gang members. The leader tells the kids to “gangbang them books” and avoid getting caught up in the gang lifestyle, which comes off as preachy and ridiculous. Another scene where Dr. Dre learns of his younger brother’s death while on tour with the group is also rather melodramatic and doesn’t serve any real purpose in the plot.\r It’s entertaining for the most part, but Straight Outta Compton lacks the authenticity and scope of a great biopic.",

But..........There are major problems with the narrative. As many people have pointed out, anyone with any knowledge of the history of NWA will spot inaccuracies all over the place.The main reason(s) for this is that the film's producers include NWA founders Dr. Dre and Ice Cube. With them involved in the film on all levels, they go to great lengths to promote their own legends.No mention of anything controversial either man did, and only passing references made to contemporary newspaper/magazine articles they refused to contradict.There's also the small matter of almost deleting the other members of NWA (apart from Eazy-E) from the story altogether, something which was dismissed with the notion of how important they were beyond the initial formation of the group, which is a ludicrous notion.Also, the film is far, far, far too long. The first 60 minutes is electrifying, but the remaining almost hour and a half drags so much.Overall, it's a film you would probably watch once, just for the experience. However, don't go into it thinking you'll get a deep expose of the formation of the group, the background of its members, and an accurate portrayal of what happened after the band made it big.It take massive liberties with what is (and isn't) included, and (as mentioned) plays up the 'Legends' surrounding Dre, Cube and E.",

And, let me say, I got introduced to N.W.A from this movie, and I really think that the history of the group is pretty fascinating. That doesn't mean that I didn't already know who Dr. Dre and Ice Cube are, I just never knew that there was a group that included these famous rappers, and it was a real surprise when I saw that Dr Dre and Ice Cube were in the same group. Now that I know the history of N.W.A, it really makes rap music for me more interesting than it did before. The movie is well directed and it has humor and drama at the appropriate times. And the ending was really a surprise to me, because I really didn't have a clue about these rappers' histories, I just knew them by their name. There are some fantastic scenes in this movie that are so unforgettable. However, I have heard that some of these characters are sometimes inaccurately represented in this movie and the movie left out some events, but still I really liked this movie a lot.

The film focuses on the men that would eventually form the NWA and their rise to stardom and provides a commentary on the state of racism in America in the late 80's to early 90's and what the foundation of their musical movement was made from. The film takes us from the inception of the NWA and charts the history up until the creation of Dr Dres Aftermath record label in 1996.I will preface this with I have a very limited understanding of rap and hip hop. I enjoy it, I have listened to a multitude of albums but would not consider myself an aficionado. Regardless of your interest in the music director F. Gary Gray handles the material with skill. You are invested in the plights of these young men, who are at times fairly unlikeable and I found myself wrapped up in the narrative of the sheer craziness that happened behind the scenes when this music first came onto the scene. F. Gary Gray gets an awful lot out of his cast particularly with O'Shea Jackson Jr. who turns in an excellent performance as his father Ice Cube.As a piece of work studying a moment in history it is eye opening and I believe captures the mood of the moment exceptionally well. However it must be said it must be taken with a slight pinch of salt regarding its overall accuracy.  I don't know the history well enough but after some brief reading, one of the main points of controversy is the handling of the groups manager Jerry Heller, played here by Paul Giamatti who is clearly having a very good time and how the the events between him and the group are depicted (I believe a lawsuit was ongoing at the time of Hellers death in 2016).Accuracy concerns aside there is much to enjoy here even if you have no interest in the music. The narrative is well handled and the performances from all involved get you wrapped up in the drama. I do believe it was Aaron Sorkin that said 'don't let the truth get in the way of a good story'.",
