  "summary": "Recent college graduate Anastasia Steele begins a sexually charged relationship with handsome, yet tormented billionaire Christian Grey.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Great art it's not – but it's frisky, in charge of itself, and about as keenly felt a vision of this S&M power game we could realistically have expected to see.",
    "The film never pretends to be other than what it really is: soft-core porn for the ladies, diluted with an “R” rating.",
    "With a loose-limbed naturalness, she conveys naiveté, intellectual curiosity and romantic yearning, and shows the unassuming Ana’s newfound thrill at being seen, however complicated the man holding her in his admiring gaze. She’s open and vulnerable but no fool. Best of all, Johnson and her director embrace Ana’s paradox: She snickers at Christian’s predilections, but they also turn her on.",
    "Fifty Shades of Grey isn't the howling pornucopia it could be, but it's sexy enough, spank you very much.",
    "I spoil nothing by reporting what readers already know, that when Fifty Shades is not a dirty story, it is, as the trilogy unfolds, a study in cartoonishly weird family dynamics.",
    "Starring a vivacious Dakota Johnson and a game Jamie Dornan, Taylor-Johnson’s erotic romance is a skillful distillation of James’ first book that captures the heady exhilaration of being someone’s fixation.",
    "The director of the much-anticipated adaptation, Sam Taylor-Johnson, made what could have been a trashy TV movie into well-conceived cinema.",
    "Despite what you might fear, the movie is not torture. And even if it doesn’t inspire lust, you will breathe a warm sigh of relief, thinking: This could have been so much worse.",
    "The surprise, if there is a surprise here, is that the film has found a slyly humorous tone for much of the running time.",
    "The film strips Fifty Shades of Grey to its essentials: a confident man, an awkward girl, and a red room rimmed with leather handcuffs. From there, Taylor-Johnson rebuilds. She constructs an erotic dramedy that takes its romance seriously even as it admits that Christian Grey's very existence is absurd.",
    "Johnson’s Ana squeezes believability out of one of the more silly romantic entanglements in recent popular culture. It’s all there in her face, which Taylor-Johnson frames in close-up. She’s fully aware this scenario is ridiculous, but can’t seem to turn away from its lunacy.",
    "Glossy, well cast, and a consistent hoot until it becomes a serious drag, this neo-“9½ Weeks” is above all a slick exercise in carefully brand-managed titillation — edgier than most grown-up studio fare, but otherwise a fairly mild provocation in this porn-saturated day and age.",
    "Fifty Shades of Grey is a sex-positive but hopelessly soft-core erotic drama that fails to be even a fraction as titillating as the E.L. James books that inspired it. And yet, that’s exactly why it works.",
    "Credit goes to director Sam Taylor-Johnson and her screenwriter, Kelly Marcel, who've stripped the first book of its biggest flaws, while still honoring its essence. And lead Dakota Johnson makes for an ideal heroine, though — as doubters feared — her chemistry with costar Jamie Dornan doesn't always sizzle.",
    "It's a very slick film. But in the end, that slick becomes suffocating, and there's no real pulse here.",
    "There's real hypocrisy here. If a movie like Fifty Shades of Grey is supposed to offer a voyeuristic experience - and not a ridiculous experience - have some integrity about your nudity. Despite what the filmmakers may want to believe, there isn't a lot else going on here. Fifty Shades of Grey Matter, not so much.",
    "In the annals of sexually-charged event cinema, Fifty Shades of Grey barely lights a candle let alone combusts with unbridled forbidden passion.",
    "Fifty Shades of Grey is a generic romance cynically engineered to appeal to the lowest common denominator of female fantasy.",
    "Much was made about how, with respectable director Sam Taylor-Johnson at the helm, Fifty Shades was going to be a legitimately good movie. It’s not, and it’s also not over-the-top enough to suggest future cult-classic status. What it is is a movie best saved for at home viewing, both because there is no compelling reason to see it on the big screen, and mostly because the pause, rewind and fast-forward controls are sure to come in handy.",
    "Sometimes intelligent, often cuddlesome and ultimately bland.",
    "It’s billionaire-glossy, as much an ode to consumerism as a study in sadomasochism; intermittingly titillating, with fugitive flashes of droll; and, bondage apart, a dutifully romantic tale of an old-fashioned girl who takes a particularly roundabout route to true love.",
    "In the end, there’s nothing here we haven’t seen before. But there’s also nothing as agonizingly awkward as James’s prose.",
    "The movie version of Fifty Shades is better than the book. It's still awful, but when a filmmaker starts with stupid source material, he's handcuffed.",
    "Leads Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, both of whom spend the majority of the film supposedly desperately longing for each other, have so little chemistry that it gives the sexy goings-on a rather clinical feel.",
    "The movie isn't a complete disaster -- it's got a strong performance at its core from Dakota Johnson, and it looks sleek and modern, like a Beyonce video or a Calvin Klein commercial -- but it's an unpleasant experience with a sleazy stench that sticks in a way that E.L. James' novel doesn't.",
    "The enormous, make-or-break things are perfectly in place, and just that is enough for a reasonably enjoyable movie. But plot problems, some comically weak dialogue, repetitious scenes and a non-ending ending keep the experience a little more earthbound than it had to be.",
    "Fifty Shades encourages us to buy into this credulity-straining scenario because the actors go well together (casting director Francine Maisler did the heavy lifting), Dornan's steely resolve facing off nicely against Johnson's engaging feistyness as each tries to make this cross-cultural relationship work on his or her own terms.",
    "Choosing to ignore any conventional sense of drama, progression, or resolution is, in its way, a memorable choice. But while Fifty Shades Of Grey is a memorable and society-shifting cultural event, it’s in no way a memorable movie.",
    "Fifty Shades of Grey is nowhere near as laughable as you might have feared (or perversely hoped for): It’s elegantly made, and Dakota Johnson is so good at navigating the heroine’s emotional zigs and zags that you want to buy into the whole cobwebbed premise.",
    "I wouldn’t say that Taylor-Johnson has made a good movie from Fifty Shades of Grey, precisely. That’s asking too much. But she and Marcel have risen to the challenge of this bizarre cultural moment with an odd and memorable film.",
    "The entire movie is about as sexy as a root canal.",
    "Jamie Dornan somehow manages to render his sculpted beauty moot, which throws a major wrench in the gears for a film dependent on eroticism.",
    "Essentially a Harlequin Romance with pulleys, E.L. James’s novel is not exactly “Lady Chatterley’s Lover,” but the movie, directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson and written by Kelly Marcel takes itself so seriously that it almost cries out to be lampooned. I’m sure the “Saturday Night Live” crew is already on the case.",
    "Directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson from Kelly Marcel's screenplay, the considerable talent behind the camera and a modicum of considerable performances yield a few undeniable guilty pleasures, but most viewers will be seeking a safe word to escape this two-hour-plus mess of half-baked excess.",
    "It's a bondage movie without much perversion, a love story without much passion, and ultimately, a film burdened with expectations it could never fulfill. It never quite hits as hard as you want it to.",
    "Dakota Johnson is a revelation in an adaptation that’s better than it should have been. But with the sex scenes and the drama lacking the required heat, it’s ultimately unsatisfying.",
    "And there you have the problem with this film. It is gray with good taste — shade upon shade of muted naughtiness, daubed within the limits of the R rating. Think of it as the “Downton Abbey” of bondage, designed neither to menace nor to offend but purely to cosset the fatigued imagination. You get dirtier talk in most action movies, and more genitalia in a TED talk on Renaissance sculpture.",
    "Yes, there are sex scenes in the film, quite a few. But for a movie where people are naked for a large chunk of time and play at bondage and dominance (without ever really seeming all that committed to it), it sure is boring.",
    "Who would have imagined that a movie about sex could be so boring? That's the bottom line when it comes to Fifty Shades of Grey.",
    "The long-awaited, highly anticipated, much-discussed film adaptation of the first segment of E L James’ inexplicably popular \"Fifty Shades\" trilogy is a tedious exercise in dramatic wheel-spinning that doesn’t have the courage to explore the darkest elements of the characters and doesn’t have the originality to stand on its own merits.",
    "Clinical as a classroom lecture, it’s a limp sadomasochism primer, which explains both the runaway success of the E.L. James novel and the startling pre-opening sales stats from America’s Promise Keepers belt.",
    "Fifty Shades of Grey might not be a good movie — O.K., it’s a terrible movie — but it might nonetheless be a movie that feels good to see, whether you squirm or giggle or roll your eyes or just sit still and take your punishment.",
    "The true audiences for Fifty Shades of Grey are gluttons for punishment — by boredom.",
    "Sitting through the turgid and tedious S&M melodrama that is Fifty Shades of Grey may feel like its own form of torture.",
    "While the first half has a brisk, upfront approach, the final hour is gobsmackingly dull - with emphasis on the smacking.",
    "Ultimately, Fifty Shades Of Grey is embarrassing and depressing, especially when considering the picture as a reflection of the quality of mainstream modern romance today."

If you manage to make it through the movie without nodding off at the tedium or just cutting your losses and leaving early, you will understand why the distributors and their media enablers had to promote the heck out of this dog to get people into the theatres. The record that 50SOG should be setting is \"the year's biggest gotcha.\" What a bunch of hype for a zero of a movie.\r The thin storyline is nothing new. To reduce it to its basics and give nothing away that you probably have not already surmised just from the trailer and the heavy hype leading up to its release:  Sicko beats up Flavor of the Moment and she pretends to enjoy it in exchange for access to Sicko's money and trappings, natch.  Charming, huh?  A romantic Valentine story?  Not and not.\r Tinsel Town has reached another low in this stinker of a movie with its fake flagellations, man-on-woman violence and gratuitous sex.  About the best that can be said is that at least you get to sit in a theatre seat out of the winter cold for two hours, and you do have two hours of escapism where you do not have to consider the day's beheadings by the Islamic terrorists steadily expanding their already-New Hampshire-sized territory.\r 50SOG is pretty much devoid of imagination:  If this S & M genre is your thing, the oldie The Story of O, or even 9 1/2 Weeks, is not as tedious as this movie is, and those casts are better-looking and better actors.  Older filmgoers might also vaguely equate the lack of merit in 50SOG with the icky, degrading Last Tango in Paris:  Maria, the butter.  Ana baby, the whip.  Hollywood cannot seem to \"discipline\" itself to avoid these irresponsible and degrading themes.\r Obviously, 50SOG is unapologetically anti-woman and pro-sexual-violence, and generations of women with any sense of history or context (and critical thinking skills surpassing those of a second grader - and let us not forget that most second graders would have a keener sense of stranger danger than apparently the stupid Ana does) are hurling in their popcorn to think that any moviegoers, particularly the confused women who have fueled the success of this dud in both book and now movie form, mistake sexual assault and battery with love, romance or satisfactory coupling.  Sexual abuse is not love.  Abuse is not cute, not clever, not cool, not fun, not funny, not entertaining.  Abuse is sick and an offense.  Where is the PC Police when you really need them?\r The US film industry must be pretty dead, too, if Melanie Griffith's daughter could not get better work than this merde, given her connections.\r Bottom line, as is obvious from my opinion as expressed in this review, and which also seems to be the 186 to 132 majority view of reviewers on this thread:  Save your time and money for a good movie, as 50SOG stinks.  About the only reason to waste your time with this dog is if it is a cold day and you need a place to get in out of the elements for two (long) hours and you only have $14 in your pocket.  Otherwise, stay clear.- La Mer\r Rating: One half of one star out of five stars.",

I went into the theater completely prepared to be embarrassed because of how graphic it wasJust finished watching Fifty Shades of Grey and I gotta say... the film was beautiful. Yes, I am using the word beautiful to describe this movie. I went into the theater completely prepared to be embarrassed because of how graphic it was supposed to be, but I was extremely surprised by how I actually felt. I watched all of the scenes that were made available and thought that it all seemed a bit awkward, but it was only because there was no background music or noise. Watching the actual scenes in the movie was a whole other experience.\rThe movie is getting a really bad rep because of the bad writing and graphic scenes that are in the book that it is based on. However, the movie is not just a \"sex movie\" like everyone says. It's pretty hilarious and romantic. The sex scenes were extremely dialed down and they all served a purpose. If you thought the pointless sex in The Wolf of Wall Street was acceptable, then you would be more than okay with the content in this Fifty Shades. Before I watched Fifty Shades of Grey, I watched a lot of interviews with the cast of the film and was confused as to how they could possibly describe the sex scenes as being classy and elegant. But then again, all I had to compare it to were scenes from Game of Thrones, True Blood, The Wolf of Wall Street, etc... After watching this film, I can honestly say that I completely agree with the cast. There was nothing \"dirty\" or \"wrong\" about what I was seeing on the screen. Sam Taylor-Johnson, the director, did an excellent job with this movie. She made it very tasteful and easier to accept. This film could have gone in a very bad direction, but thank god it didn't.\rFor those of you that think that this movie is glorifying abusive relationships, think again because I think that it actually empowers women. I'm sure that you can argue, with quotes from the book, that I'm wrong, but there are many differences between the film and the book. Let me remind all of you that the book is a little over 500 pages and the movie is only about 2 hours long. Obviously, they had to cut a lot of things out, including the blue string scene that I'm sure a lot of people are aware of. In my opinion, they cut out many of the scenes that were considered controversial. I watched the movie looking for signs of an abusive relationship, but I really didn’t see anything of that nature. In fact, all I saw was this confident and empowered woman that made all of her own decisions. She was not forced to do anything that she didn’t want to do. She wanted to explore Christian’s dark world and her own sexuality. You can argue that Christian abuses her physically and emotionally, but he does what she tells him to do. When she says stop… he stops. He tries to give her what she wants.\rMoving on to something lighter, the comedy in this movie is on point! There were many “laugh-out-loud” moments that gave the movie a lighter mood. Those scenes were there to show that Christian and Ana’s relationship was not all dark and serious. I mean they are both young people in their twenties that should be having fun!\rDakota Johnson gave a phenomenal performance and did everything right! She was confident, awkward, shy, and funny all at the same time. Jamie Dornan also did an amazing job as Christian Grey. They had great chemistry.\rI guess what I’m trying to say is that you should give the movie a chance. If you hate the book, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you will hate the movie. I have read many reviews, written by skeptics, saying that they ended up loving it. Don’t let the bad reviews or even the book itself stop you from seeing the movie. I was not disappointed at all with the finished product, even though they cut out a few scenes that I loved. It is perfect just the way it is.\r(I apologize for any grammatical mistakes...

Both will discover a place where want and desire intersect.\r Fifty Shades of Grey was a movie that I had zone interested in, because I was in that bad mood where if I see a best selling novel being made into a movie which is a cliche now, and now there did it with Fifty Shades of Grey which by the way the book sucked ass, yeah I red the book and I had no idea why it was a best seller it's basically porn on paper. What's more annoying is in the UK there are people on the Radio and everyone I met who was looking forward to this movie and my Question is why. The people on the Radio keep making top stories about it making it the hot headline and I'm here thinking \"That's really new worthy. There's loads of usual but amazing things happening around the world and this peace of **** makes the headline. My hope for humility is slowly fading away\". And that's not all, I'm not kidding you here but there actually made a headline of it's reviews it's getting and this never happened before when it comes to movies. So after seeing Fifty Shades of Grey I can say it's not as bad as people say, it's actually a lot worse then I thought.\r Now let me give you the positive things in this movie: Dakota Johnson was the only good actress in this movie, she did what she can do with a god awful script that she had and shes the only one in this movie that gives it her all. The movie is shot really good as well, it fitted the movie very well, but beside's that all those good things can't hind the fact that this is a abomination against humanity, it brings shame to cinema and it should be burn in hell.\r Now let's talk about Mr. Grey The Psychopath, now I got to ask you this what do women see in this guy, I mean his not charming at all, his cold, he's kind of a **** and what he want's to do is hurt you with sex, and the actor himself isn't really that good at all. And she doesn't enjoy it she only does it to make him feel good so in the sex scenes she's not enjoying it, she's getting hurt by this guy and after a while she get's crossed with him and then she runs off then start's to have thoughts about him and how she needs a man in her life so she goes back.\r The writing in this movie I don't know if it's for comic relief or to be taken seriously, because the writing in this movie was absolutely atrocious and it's the most cheesiest dialogue ever put to film, it's Twilight dialogue bad.\r Now is this worse than Twilight and I can't believe I'm saying this but yes it is. I found a movie that's more awful and more laughable than Twilight. I hated this movie, I hated it, I HATED IT, I HATED IT. This is the worst movie of 2015, I can't wait to forget this film. You better off seeing Kingsman: The Secret Service, I haven't see it myself yet but at least that movie looks well made and effort went into it.",

It’s an adaption of one of the most poorly written novels in recent memory and makes the Twilight trilogy’s Stephanie Meyers—which it initially originated from, being a fan fiction—look like J.D. Salinger. It’s also one of the poorest representations of the BDSM community I’ve ever witnessed and I’d argue that it’s actually about a mentally unstable man who uses “BDSM” to stabilize his sadist mind—if I took “erotic” fan fiction seriously. But Fifty Shades of Grey just wasn’t as unwatchable as I initially predicted it to be and, to my surprise, it has entertainment value—if not in its target audience, it has laughable dialogue, cheap acting performances, and an overall sense of silliness, the way it boasts the fetish it knows nothing of, which should make it a must-see for the ones who antagonize it most. But otherwise, this isn’t a film I wouldn’t particularly remember, for better or worse, if it weren’t for the controversy, criticism and cultural criticism surrounding it. It’s merely a mediocrity dressed in clothing that might catch everyone’s attention, both good and bad, but some of us who neither treasure nor hate this franchise see how unfitting it truly is.",

This movie was created only to make money since the book became famous because of its erotic clasification and a controversial BDSM related themes. I've read the books and after seen the movie, I was very disapointed, the MOST important thing about this book is every thought Anastasia had about Grey and BDSM, in this movie you cant get to know what is going on in her mind. You can interpret that she doesnt like the way he is or the way he treats her, but she still got into BDSM practices, and the important WHY she did it, its totally missing. To make this movie even worse, one of the things that people critizised about the book, is that BDSM is practiced by people with psychological problems, people that need help, people that are sick... and once again this movie fails into proyecting this same way of seen Grey as a sick person.\r Bad sex scenes, failure in thansmiting the main ideas of the bdsm and Anastasias thoughts, and TERRBLE performance of the principal character Christian Grey, in the movie he looks like an idiot, VERY different form the book.\r Dont waste your time watching this movie, I know many people dont like to read, but believe me, if you want to know what the fifty shades are all about, you better read the books.",

Jamie Dornan is unwatchable as the presumably (I presume because it's never expressed) sexy bachelor, he feels wooden and not in the intended way Christian was written (albeit terribly) to be. Dakota Johnson at least attempts and is unsuprisingly the only one willing to go bare for the sake of her charater. Another thing I  found frustrating was how no arcs were explored satisfyingly such as José attempted assault, the family dinner,his intimacy issues,Anna's fears etc. They just use every scene as interludes b4 they f ,nit as opportunities to develop characters.

I mean: Putting aside the BDSM scenes, in many stages there was unavoidable to remember similarities (including \"bed scenes\") with the film starred by Julia Roberts and Richard Gere in the 90s. And this is precisely the main point: people went to see some erotic dark movie following the trailers and the expectation but, in return, they received a romantic tragicomedy film that, in my opinion, lacks of the conviction needed to connect the audience to the story. My note: 2 points, one of them by the staging and the other by the excellent performance of Dakota Johnson.",

Low and behold, welcome to the world of popularI bet that if I were to ask the majority of the main demographic watching Fifty Shades of Grey this weekend what the acronym BDSM stands for, I would get a very unsatisfied and baffled answer. Low and behold, welcome to the world of popular culture and worldwide phenomenas for no damn good reason.\r If someone were to ask me, how and why this particular novel, written atrociously by British author E.L. James became such a huge success, I wouldn’t know where to begin. Upon all the controversy, arguments and opinions about the novel and its depiction of submissive sexual culture, I guess we, as a general population, have to accept the fact that sometimes, people and certain pieces of pop culture, just get lucky for being around at the right place, at the right time.\r It’s not like erotic literature or erotic novels didn’t exist before E.L. James’ novel, its that THIS particular novel caught on with readers and has become the worldwide best-seller for the simple fact that, it just did. Upon learning about my advance sneak passes to the film, I went in with the highest level of professionalism and optimism possible, but when a film knows its going to be a hit, regardless of its talent and execution on screen, you pretty well have sealed your fate in the world of film criticism.\r I’m not sure if the actors and screenwriter Kelly Marcel intended for the dialogue and execution of the film to be so wooden, laughable and campy, but I guess when you are adapting a film to a novel that has been deemed unworthy of professional publication, regardless of your level of screenwriting and acting skills, you can’t do much. From the moment the screen is filled with the shaded lighting of corporate florescent bulbs in the Grey building, one cannot help but notice how little effort is put into the film’s production.\r Set around one of the most conventional narrative foundations ever, Fifty Shades of Grey is your typical Romeo and Juliet love story of forbidden love. Upon learning of her friend Kate’s (Eloise Mumford) illness, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is forced by her best friend to cover for school newspaper’s article upcoming interview with the mysterious and intimidating business magnate Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). Once Ana and Christian meet, the two begin a steamy and sensual relationship filled with singular sexual tastes, obsession, seduction and mental and emotional pain and pleasure. Yup, thats it.\r Before the film even started production, the casting process gain high media attention. Having Angelina Jolie reject directing the film, Chritian Cooke, Dominic Cooper and Stephen Amell circling the role of Christian Grey, and talented actresses Felicity Jones, Elizabeth Olsen, Imogen Poots and Shailene Woodley reportedly being considered and auditioning for the role of Ana Steele, the cast was settled with Dakota Johnson and Charlie Hunnam. Hunnam, who withdrew from the film due to a backlash of media frenzied fans who said the role simply wasn’t meant for the actor, officially abandoned the project and was replaced by Dornan. Notice how more is being written about the casting history of the film more than the plot itself?\r The lead actors of the film, must have approached the role as a double edged sword of fame and credibility. For one, Johnson and Dornan are destined of becoming household names, especially with the promise of huge economic gain, given the novels already huge fan base and demands of sequels. Yet, Fifty Shades of Grey brings to question one very important question: are artists and actors, willing to sacrifice their artistic integrity for fame and fortune? I mean, how else could one describe the leads being able to learn and mesmerize their lines in only five days?\r Fifty Shades of Grey did not upset me as much as I thought it would. What upsets me most about this highly questionable and overwhelmingly popular phenomena is its misuse in everyday people’s lives and the misleading conception of romance and its force for capitalist gain. Whereas, this time of year, romantic films are cleverly slotted before the Valentine’s Day week, this is one film that abandons romance and the pure notion of ‘love’ for sole monetary gain. Do people really care to be the submissive? Is there going to be a surge in toys and fetish tools thanks to the film? Quite possibly. How else do you explain an officially marketed branding of fifty shades sex toys and fetish equipment at your local sex store?",

From the standpoint of a film student, having techniques and all ingrained into my mind, I do give this movie a star on cinematography, because I did appreciate it. Some of the set lighting was curiously put, but it worked. I didn't like the acting. It was awkward. Not a spark of chemistry for me between Dorman and Johnson. There wasn't enough background for me either. This was really just a mess, and the sex made its money back. I didn't have much for this movie at all.

When it comes to a film like this, the question and really the only relevant question that I have is “what the fecal matter is“Fifty Shades of Grey Review”\r So for the second time, I just finished watching this movie and...wow, just wow. When it comes to a film like this, the question and really the only relevant question that I have is “what the fecal matter is this?” This movie is horrible and I'll cast some light as to the reasons why it's horrible but first let me note a few things. I'm not going to even bother structuring this review. This means making separate sections for “Presentation”, “Characters”, “Music”, etc. This movie doesn't deserve that level of time or effort.\r I'm not going to insult the word “spoiler” because this movie doesn't have a plot. I'm not going sit here and write paragraph after paragraph after paragraph explaining in every little small exquisite detail why this movie is bad which I could very well do but considering two hours of my time has already been wasted, I'm not going to stress out my level of patience further. Now onto my tailored and straightforward to the point review of this crap known as Fifty Shades of Grey.\r First of all, I'm going to be blunt, this movie does not have a plot. I repeat, there is no story in this movie which is understandable because this bull**** is based off a trilogy of books inspired by ******* Twilight. That within of itself says enough and it says enough in spades. The premise for this garbage, and I can't believe I just insulted the word “garbage” is about a young college grad named Anastasia Steele or Anna. Anna goes to interview this young billionaire, that's right “Billionaire”, pretty boy, named Christian Grey. Christian just after one interview almost immediately becomes a stalker and with enough persistence, he and Anna elope in this one sided relationship which involves her becoming his sex slave. After about an hour and fifty minutes of nothing, Anna finally decides to grow a brain and she considers the relationship to be abusive despite the fact that it was an abusive relationship from the start and this was explained to her by Christian himself exactly what this was going to be early on in the movie. So, Anna decides to leave Christian and the movie ends. Cut to black, begin end credits. …Yeah, that's the movie. And as a word of some positivity, Dakota Johnson wasn't too bad in this. She did inject some humor into her lifeless character but she nor anyone else is saving this film right here.\r So what's the problem with the movie? Many things, the first being the way this was marketed. Fifty Shades of Grey was marketed to be this soft-core pornographic film being toted as a serious movie. In that regard alone, this is somewhat okay considering other films such as Secretary have done the same and have done this a lot better but that's for another discussion. The problem with Fifty Shades in this regard is the fact that the “porn” in this movie is bare-bones the minimum of what they could have done. Yes there's nudity in the film but aside from a flat chested Dakota Johnson flash every now and then and someone's a** cheeks popping up on screen, this is some of the most boring “porn” that you could watch. The movie tends to cut these scenes long before they have the chance to become interesting and they're not even shot very well. To make matters worse, the pornographic material is the only thing that the movie has going for it.\r The characters in this movie, they're all bad, all of them. I don't care if you're talking about the potentially wasted guy friend of Anastasia, her roommate, her father, her mother, Christian's mother, his brother, it doesn't matter. They're all bad. The only two characters given any appropriate screen time are Christian and Anastasia themselves and neither one of them are good characters. In fact, they're both poorly written and very, very rage inductively stupid. Anastasia is one of the worst written female characters that I've seen in a film in quite some time. Women always want to talk about how Hollywood doesn't take women seriously and throws them in cliché roles yet, the majority of you hypocrites want to go out and pay to see a dumb bland character like this as a protagonist. To those women out there who paid for this, you're only insulting yourself at this point. Anastasia is stupid, she's dumb, she's bland, she's hardheaded, she's uninteresting, she's not even all that attractive! Dakota Johnson is pretty but she's not a supermodel looking chick and for a rich character like Christian Grey, you would think he would be acting like a stalker/serial killer for someone whom at least looks like a supermodel but no! He goes for the bare-minimum of what he can supposedly get, despite his high profile status which is overemphasized to the point of illogical irrelevance and sheer utter stupidity in this stupid movie.\r Christian himself to say a few words, is literally as I explained. He personifies the traits of a stalker/serial killer and he can get away with it because he's handsome and he's a billionaire which by the way, and I know this question has been asked with this retarded series but, did a sixteen year old girl write this? An example of this behavior by this Christian character would be a scene near the beginning of the movie just after Anna and Christian meets one another. Anna is in the middle of working at her job and from right around the corner isle, this creepy a**hole just pops up out of nowhere like a damn stalker with the first words out of his mouth being “I thought it was you”. Yeah I'm sure you did think it was her. You were probably watching her from the moment she walked out of her home to the moment you decided it was a good idea to wait in a specific isle like the shadow of god damn Michael Myers.\r That's just a tip of the iceberg of what's wrong with this character. Another scene, the club scene, which is also near the beginning of the movie, Anna gets drunk and Christian calls her scolding her as if he was her father despite the fact that they literally met barely even ten minutes ago in the film. (Phone Ringing) (Christian Grey Calling) Anastasia: “I'm sorry I didn't mean,” Christian: “Stay where you are I'm coming to get you” Anastasia: “What?” (Click) ME: “The ****??” All this bs and it's not even thirty minutes into the movie! The entire useless two hours of this abysmal calamity has this Anastasia character questioning “well why don't we go on a date?” “why can't I touch you?” “why can't we be like normal people?” He explained to you from the beginning what this relationship was going to be!!!! What the ****?!! It takes this girl two hours to grow a brain and say “I've had enough”. You should've been done with him when he showed you his sex dungeon! Any self respecting woman would've dropped this guy at several scenes in this movie but oh no not Anastasia! Because without bs, these lazy Hollywood executives would have no means of selling tickets because the movie would only last five minutes tops.\r Then the movie takes its bs even further with the Christian Grey character. So when Anastasia isn't getting on your nerves, it's this stupid idiot who sprouts some of the worst dialogue that I've heard in a while. The entire movie, this guy is moping, literally moping and he regurgitates the same thing over and over again. “I don't do romance”, “I don't do dating”, “I don't do intimacy” Bull****!! All he ever does is romance!! And this movie further misses an opportunity by trying to give this character a back story. Apparently the whole BDSM nonsense comes from him being a submissive to his mother's friend when he was a teenager. The sad part is that the movie could have been about that! The movie could have set up the plot where it was about this guy who was abusing this woman and all the women before her because he was trying to get back at this crazy woman who abused him the same way. But no! Instead what we get is a two hour live action equivalent of the Looney Tunes show, with unrealistic characters bantering the same nonsense back and forth. “Why can't we be normal?” “I don't do romance” “Why can't we be normal?” “I don't do romance” “Why can't we be normal?” “I don't do romance”. Over and over and over and over again like the movie is trying to bash your skull in with poor writing and even worse developed and uninteresting lead characters.\r And before I close out of this review, I want to mention the contract. Yes, these two idiots in this movie made a contract which discloses exactly what Christian is allowed/not allowed to do to Anastasia when they're engaged in sexual activity but this scene is completely pointless as later in the movie, Christian says it himself. “**** the contract”. Those are his exact words. So why did we insert this scene in this movie again? Oh that's right, it's in the movie to cover up the fact that for two hours, nothing of importance happens in this movie.\r Fifty Shades of Grey besides Insurgent, another piece of diarrhea vomit that I will also review, is the most recent laziest and cheapest attempt at making money for Hollywood. The movie reeks of tropes that are specifically designed and placed into the film just to attract a dumb audience full of drones that will no doubt buy the Blu-ray on day one which is why this crap is at the number one spot on Amazon.com in the genre of romance which again is funny considering the fact that there is no legit romance in this movie, just BS! Because how can a movie based off a book series that's inspired from something as dull and stupid as the Twilight series possibly be about anything? And that's another thing, even Twilight is better than this! How do you accomplish something like that?!! At least in Twilight you had a decapitation here and there before it returned back to the same some ole repetitive BS. In this nonsense however, there's nothing of interest to look forward to, nothing, not one god damn thing. If this is really what women and I know its not all of you out there but me speaking to the majority. If this is really what women describe as entertainment then it's nothing but dark days ahead for mainstream audiences who like to go to the movies such as myself, even for general audiences.\r This is why Indies will always be better than what's mainstream in the film industry. There are too many idiots who don't care about the art form of film or even care about movies in general paying to go to the theater and have a “good time”. These people don't care about pacing or plot or character development. It's the equivalent of everyone who goes to see these fun but regurgitated superhero movies and loud nonsensical IQ insulting CGI fests like the Michael Bay Transformer films. The only difference is that movies like Fifty Shades of Grey, Twilight, and The Host are targeted towards a female audience who think they want to see romance but don't have a clear grasp on what that word actually means. It's a sad day, dark times are ahead for people who actually care about quality entertainment. If anyone has given this more than a one star up on here, you should be ashamed. By the way, can't wait for the even worse sequels to this nonsense, tsk. What's the next one called I wonder. ...Oh Fifty Shades Darker, how original. Yeah if you value common sense and especially if you value decent story telling then do yourself a favor and skip this.",

But having read that the film was supposed to be better, that a score of script doctors worked on improving the characters and the plot, and stupidly getting into the frenzy of how inappropriate it was supposed to be - I went to see it. Even with the lowest of expectations that you can possibly have I hardly managed to sit through all of it. It bored me to death. The main plot is a totally unrealistic, flat and uninspiring, it's worse than piece of fan fiction written by a seventeen year old. Since I don't know the original book, I must assume it's even worse, which makes me shiver with dread. I have no idea why this film is rated 18+ in the UK, and described as including strong sex scenes - it has rather innocent sex scenes - all three of them. I've seen much more hardcore stuff in lower rated films, this is just ridiculous to call this film erotic - it isn't. And don't get fooled - the only BDSM - related scenes are the toys inside the red room. That remain mostly unused.\rBut lack of sex is not the worst thing about it (although I suppose the viewers should complain about being mislead by the ad campaign around the film to believe they were going to see an erotic drama). the worst part is that I've never seen so poorly constructed characters before. They lack any dimensions, they are just two dummies, moved around by a kindergarten kid, reciting those daft, lifeless dialogues.\rI have never regretted paying money to see any film - but I do now. Luckily it's unlikely anyone but the hard core fans will be going to see the next two installments of this atrocity.\rThe only mildly funny moment is the allusion to Jamie Dornan's role in The Fall. But it's not worth the money paid for the 2 hours of torture (and it's not the kind leading to satisfaction).\rFilms like this one should be forbidden. It's awful to think some people watch it religiously, but then religion is the opium for the masses. And the masses lack the taste.",

And, normally, this would give such a movie the chance toHaving read average reviews of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' prior to seeing it - and being male - my expectations of this movie-adaptation of a book distinctly targeted at women were low. And, normally, this would give such a movie the chance to surprise me and be a bit better than expected. Unfortunately not, in the case of this particular film.\rThere are so many issues with it, that it's difficult to know where to begin. I guess the best place to start is with the leading actor and actress: Jamie Dornan (playing Christian Grey) and Dakota Johnson (Anastasia Steele). To say that there is little chemistry between these two would be an understatement. The problem being that this then permeates the rest of the movie; how can you believe any of the actions of the characters when you can't even believe that there is any love between them? Other than being rich, Christian's character has little going for him. His complete lack of humour or charisma, particularly in the first scene in which Anastasia meets him, leaves you wondering why Ana is so taken with him.\rQuick question for any women reading this review: if a potential boyfriend did any of the following things, what would your reaction be: a) Stalked you; b) Broke into your home and confronted you; c) Asked you to sign a contract saying that you'd do whatever he wanted (sexually) to please him; d) Told you that you're not sleeping in the same bed as him because that's \"not his thing\". That's right: you'd run a mile (possibly whilst phoning the police). Which really then begs questions as to why, on the basis of the books, Christian Grey seems to have become such a sex symbol. Is this really the kind of man that women fantasise about?\rThings don't get any better outside of the main two characters, either. Not to say that the other actors/actresses are all terrible but the parts they play are just so pointless that you wonder why they even needed to be in the movie. Max Martini (playing Christian's driver, Taylor) is completely wasted in a role that could have provided a bit more warmth and/or humour to the movie. On the other side of things, the scenes with Anastasia and her friend Kate (Eloise Mumford) are so painfully wooden that it feels like they're two really poor actresses reading directly from the script, auditioning for a part in the movie. We meet Christian's family and Anastasia's parents briefly, but they have little time (or dialogue) in which to contribute anything to the film.\rFinally, on the negative aspects, I'll bring up the main reason that 'Fifty Shades of Grey' has garnered so much interest: the sex scenes. I don't think it's unfair to say that they are about as far from erotic as they could possibly be. I've seen far sexier scenes in movies that didn't even require nudity to be sexy. Each sex scene in the movie seems to follow the same (or a very similar) pattern: 1) He takes her clothes off; 2) He ties her up (and possibly puts a blindfold over her eyes); 3) He takes his own clothes off; 4) He kisses her body (working further and further down); 5) She opens her mouth, moans and groans, and arches her back whilst the director uses the only two shots that she seems to have in her arsenal: the shot from above, and the side-shot, both avoiding revealing any genitalia. To be honest you can't help but feel that, by the time Christian has finished tying knots in all the ropes, Anastasia would have fallen asleep rather than be feeling aroused.\rThe one bright point of the movie is some of the humorous dialogue provided by Anastasia (particularly her drunk phone call to Christian and a 'business meeting' with him). These are few and far between though and also felt slightly out of place in a movie which covers fairly dark material at times.\rWhat I will say is that if this movie had actually been produced with absolutely no intention of a sequel being made, then it could have been much improved. We could have seen Christian's love for Anastasia turn him from being a cold, distant character into a loving, caring person (think 'Despicable Me' but for adults). Unfortunately, we get a ludicrous open-ended finale which leaves you feeling like the movie went absolutely nowhere in the space of two hours. Ironically, I think this approach is bad for the franchise overall: instead of delivering one reasonably good movie, you're going to get possibly 3 terrible ones. That's up for argument though: whilst I'm sure this movie will do well at the box office, I truly believe that - once people realise how badly it fails to deliver on its erotic premise - there may not be quite the same appetite for a sequel. Only time will tell.",

I had heard mixed reviews of the books from people saying they were sexually liberating to it being a story of abuse. I am going with the latter if the movie is anything to go by. Christian Grey is a stalker and while I have loved Dornan in other work in this movie I found him flat, unappealing and impossible to connect with. Perhaps that is how Grey is supposed to be? I have not seen Johnson's other work but while she is an attractive young woman I found Ana a complete bore. I had really high hopes for this character hoping that she would be a strong woman who enters BDSM to further strengthen herself. Instead she is weak and I am surprised she resisted signing the contract and I am surprised she left at the end because in every other part of the movie she seems to give in to Grey's whims even when she has said she does not want to. I found it creepy that Grey did not take no for an answer and seduced her whenever she tried to resist him.\r I was also disgusted in how they portrayed BDSM as some kind of mental disorder of Christians (Although I believe this is directly from the book)\r Fifty Shades of Grey demonstrated how you can get two very attractive actors to perform a sex scene and yet have it not the vaguest bit arousing or hot. I am a huge lover of BDSM and yet found myself not even slightly amused, entertained or even aroused by the whipping or bondage. Is this not meant to be an erotic love story?  Furthermore the lack of chemistry between Johnson and Dornan was so clear that I could not believe their relationship for a second.\r The dialogue was laughable and cheesy. I can't even begin to express how hard it was for me to listen to the badly delivered drivel.\r The movie lacked a climax (Unless the scene where he beats Ana is supposed to be that) and the best part was the ending. I wish it did end there because then I could live in the fantasy that Ana goes back to a life free from abuse and Christian gets therapy. But there are two more of these to come!\r There were only two things I liked about this movie:\rThe soundtrack\rAnd the scene where they discuss the terms of the contract - for in that moment there was actually a glimmer that Ana could be a strong powerful woman.\r However these two things could not even earn the movie one point in my opinion. I really felt as if I wasted two hours of my life and I have never seen a movie that made me feel that way before.",

Gone is the book’s blithering simpleton, with her arsenal of “holy hell”s and “double crap\"s and “oh my\"s. Her inner goddess is, thank goodness, nowhere to be found or heard. She is at no point a quivering, moist mess, and doesn’t make the ruinous error of thinking the word “f___” is an epithet.\r Grey, for obvious reasons, is much more likely to Anastasia for intimacy and mystery with which it has on the books.\r Personally , this film from start to finish was excellent , showing an introduction of a fairy tale , a totally aggressive and an end that surprised us .

Even when Grey, with his riding crops and cat-o’-nine-tails and Red Room of Pain, would claim otherwise, these sequences stay well within the bounds of vanilla mainstream taste.\r Anastasia is no walkover here and sometimes gives as good as she gets, if not better. The funniest scene – debatably the sexiest, too – has the duo sitting at either end of a glass boardroom table, while Ana whips through the contract for their experimental relationship scratching out everything she won’t consent to. The script isn’t afraid to call a spade a spade here: “Find anal fisting. Strike it out.”\r It's amazing boom that had the soundtrack of the movie taking on its lists Ellie Goulding , The Weeknd , Sia, among others. Music is a quiet and elegant journey that distorts good way every erotic moment of the film, making them much more tolerable to hear groans and hits constantly .\r The punishment of the inner goddess is very worrying and surprising , and the pain she feels , makes us mourn everyone . \"One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six\".\r The end of the movie is the best, leaving an open end and shaking us all with a simple \" No\". (This ending is much better than the book)\r There are no more words to praise the project, \"Sex, love, drama , romance , controversy , music , fame , pen and other things around to \"Fifty Shades of Grey\"",
