  "critic_reviews": [
    "With Spotlight, we get a reminder of the vital importance of an independent, professional press to any community.",
    "Director Tom McCarthy, who wrote the script with Josh Singer, has made a film without heroes.",
    "If history’s tide runs against the Globe, at least those who worked there have the satisfaction of exposing a global wrong, and helping to end it. And they have McCarthy’s film, one of the best pictures of 2015, as a permanent record, a tribute in cinematic form, to their art and craft in its finest hour.",
    "Spotlight is a rare movie about the profession — and just enough about people in it — that simply feels right, speaking from the inside.",
    "Inspiring stuff, the stuff of Hollywood all the way back to Frank Capra and before: a story of scrappy underdogs, determined to get to the truth, and toppling the mighty in the process.",
    "For all of its modesty and dedication to process, Spotlight winds up being a startlingly emotional experience, and not just for filmgoers with intimate knowledge of the culture it depicts.",
    "McCarthy and his brilliant cast make hard work and truth-telling inspiring.",
    "A snapshot of what happened at a particular time and place and doesn't try to glamorize its subjects or make any larger points about what it all means. By refusing to do so, by celebrating the process over the outcome and the work over the reward, it becomes a special experience, a movie that matters.",
    "Spotlight one of the best movies about journalism ever made, at once gripping and accurate. It doesn’t just get the big things right, such as how news stories evolve, but the small things, such as what offices look like and how staff tends to react to a new boss.",
    "Director and co-writer Tom McCarthy played a weasel of a journalist in \"The Wire.\" Now he has made a meticulous, exacting procedural on real-life journalists who excelled at their job; had the resources to do it properly; and in early 2002, published the first in a Pulitzer Prize-winning series of grim, carefully detailed stories of pedophile priests.",
    "Spotlight is simply a great story exceedingly well told, through characters whose fingers are perpetually stained with ink.",
    "No need to bury the lede: Spotlight is a masterpiece.",
    "The year is not over, but I’ve already seen my favorite film of 2015. It’s Thomas McCarthy’s brilliant, responsible, galvanizing and unforgettable Spotlight.",
    "To turn a spotlight fittingly on Spotlight, it’s the year’s best movie so far, and a rarity among countless dramatizations that claim to be based on actual events. In this one the events ring consistently — and dramatically — true.",
    "Spotlight doesn't call attention to itself. Its screenplay is self-effacing, its accomplished direction is intentionally low key, and it encourages its fistful of top actors to blend into an eloquent ensemble.",
    "This tight, relatively low-key, step-by-step procedural has a stronger impact than any horror movie.",
    "Spotlight is a gripping detective story and a superlative newsroom drama, a solid procedural that tries to confront evil without sensationalism.",
    "One of the reasons that Spotlight is so deeply, absurdly satisfying to this newspaper writer — is that Tom McCarthy’s movie doesn’t turn its journalists into heroes. It just lets them do their jobs, as tedious and critical as those are, with a realism that grips an audience almost in spite of itself.",
    "Brilliantly acted by the year’s most carefully assembled cast, Spotlight is one of the year’s best films, showing just how hard it is to uncover painful truths.",
    "This landmark film takes a clear-eyed look at the digital future and honors the one constant that journalism needs to stay alive and relevant: a fighting spirit.",
    "Tautly directed by Tom McCarthy (The Visitor), the film hums as a tense shoe-leather procedural and a heartbreaking morality play that handles personal stories respectfully without losing sight of the bigger, more damning picture.",
    "Spotlight feels both timeless and modern, a dexterously crafted film that could have been made anytime but somehow feels perfect for right now.",
    "It’s a more subtle, damning film for implicating the media – as much as the church, the courts, the legal profession and other Boston institutions – in the systematic, wider cultural cover-up it describes.",
    "Like any creative endeavor a film is the sum of its parts.  In the most elementary terms it needs a screenplay as a base, a cast to bring the script to life and a director to orchestrate the pieces into something of considerable impact.  Excuse the hyperbole, but Tom McCarthy's Spotlight is an example of when all those pieces fit together almost perfectly.",
    "Spotlight is that rare journalistic procedural that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as “All the President’s Men,” and while the movie never glamorizes or makes saints of its hard-working newsgatherers, it does stand as a reminder of the power and importance of a free press, particularly in ferreting out local corruption and malfeasance.",
    "It's the best film McCarthy has ever made: restrained, intelligent and grown-up, but unfolding with the pacing and rhythm of a thriller.",
    "For all the dogged journalism and righteous indignation in the film, it’s this sense of intimacy, of community, of betrayal and misdirected allegiances — it was the Church, after all — that keeps the film from reveling too much in victory or triumph. That, in turn, makes it an emotional tour de force.",
    "Spotlight provides a wealth of exceptional performances.",
    "One of its major virtues is what’s not there: no creepy flashbacks of prowling priests, or — as in the prelude to Clint Eastwood’s “Mystic River” — of children in the vortex of peril. Everything happens in the here and now, not least the recitation of the there and then.",
    "Like so many films consumed with the minutiae of daily journalism, Spotlight is a magnificently nerdy process movie — a tour de force of filing-cabinet cinema, made with absolute assurance that we’ll be held by scene after scene of people talking, taking notes, following tips, hounding sources, poring over records, filling out spreadsheets, and having one door after another slammed in their faces.",
    "Spotlight is a great newspaper movie, ranking up there with \"All the President’s Men\" and \"Citizen Kane\", and it’s certainly the best of its kind since \"The Paper\" in 1994, which also happened to star Michael Keaton.",
    "Keaton, who deserved an Oscar for his performance in “Birdman,” brings to Robinson a bracing blend of humor and authority. Ruffalo is the essence of the newsman who just won’t quit, and McAdams is just as effective as his more low-key colleague.",
    "Spotlight is a Valentine to investigative journalism and a stark reminder of where we’re headed now that this brand of writing has become an endangered species. The film is unique in that it focuses almost entirely on the process.",
    "Spotlight is not about fiery performances or thrilling set-pieces – it’s simply a tight and captivating look at professionals who excel at their jobs, and who legitimately care about making a difference. Sometimes, that’s more than enough.",
    "It’s not easy to make an emotionally involving film in which some of the most pivotal moments are about phone calls and making copies of documents and a source circling names on a document — but save for a few overly dry moments, Spotlight prevails.",
    "A great newspaper movie of the old-school model, calling up not only obvious comparisons with \"All the President's Men\" and \"Zodiac,\" two movies with similar devotion to the sometimes crushingly boring gumshoe part of reportage, but also Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell shouting into adjacent phones in \"His Girl Friday.\"",
    "Like \"All The President’s Men,\" it’s a muckraker movie that celebrates the power of the press by actually showing journalists doing their job, pen and notebook in hand.",
    "A rigorously detailed telling of an important story that never loses sight of the human devastation. Terrific turns from the ensemble cast.",
    "There’s no tidy moral to take away, because a story like this shouldn’t end in comfort. Instead, your skin’s left prickling by its deft deconstruction of the business of secret-keeping, and its perceptive setting out of the courage and diligence it takes to overturn it.",
    "It plays out all the usual tropes of the investigative-journalism genre – the hot tips, the clandestine meetings, the hand-wringing about ethics, etc. – without adding a jot of novelty.",
    "The overly earnest movie falls below the rich ambiguities that Keaton brings to the part, resulting in a measured drama so restrained it sometimes underserves the material. Where \"Birdman\" magnified Keaton's talent, Spotlight leans on it.",
    "A polished, engrossing procedural, Spotlight offers plenty of old-fashioned pleasures — chiefly, the sight of smart, scrappy muckraking journalists stopping at nothing to uncover systematic corruption.",
    "By modeling its structure so closely after \"All the President's Men,\" Spotlight only draws closer attention to its lack of scope and ambition.",
    "Spotlight never hits the heights of passion, but capably and decently tells an important story.",
    "This material cant help but be interesting, even compelling up to a point, but its prosaic presentation suggests that the story's full potential, encompassing deep, disturbing and enduring pain on all sides of the issue, has only begun to be touched."

The characters in the movie are sickened by the truth, and the intention of the organization to protect every child rapist, with no regard for the victims.\r This is an organized crime movie, without the honor of the mafia.",

It reminded me very much of \"All the President's Men\" with its steady, sometimes slow, yet inexorable march toward the truth: the Catholic Church's cover-up of sexual abuse of children by pedophile priests. An editorial shake-up at the Boston Globe leads to the assignment of a team of ace reporters to investigate allegations that a few priests in the area may have abused children. The scope of the investigation widens as the reporters gather more information implicating dozens of priests and the Catholic Church in what turns out to be a massive cover-up. This movie deserves an Oscar nomination at the very least. I thought that Mark Ruffalo, in particular, did an excellent job.  In fact, the whole cast was outstanding. There are several heroes in this movie--only they wield notepads, cellphones and laptops, rather than knifes, guns or bombs--or arrows. I highly recommend this film.",

Started to fade out a bit when this overarching, all-power, deity can't decide whether gay marriage is a burden on the sanctity of marriage or all his children get his love equally. Or if murdering people grants me 15 infinity years on fire, or if I can come to his party bus if I just wish upon a star. Enough about questioning the Catholic religion let's talk about Spotlight. Going in I heard that this movie treated both sides, Catholic and reporters, equally. Also that it doesn't actually make you question the logistics of religion. Either that person was deliberately lying so I'd have a bigger reaction, or he accidentally walked into Alvin and the Chipmunks: Road Chip, without noticing. This film knows how to set up the sensitive subject, it attempts to  \"fairly\" represent the Church's side in the beginning. We start with one incident of sexual assault, or rather the aftermath. It's a short scene and it doesn't show a mother weeping over her victimized child praying for the blood of the Pope, while a priest twists his handle bar mustache. It's just one of the head whatevers, talking to the kids saying the priest will be moved and never seen again. This scene cleverly, and decietfully, shows this as a one-time incident that the church regrets happened. Then we arrive with our main reporters Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), Sacha Pfieffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) they all work for a reporting group called Spotlight. They are known at covering large stories and getting to the bottom of them. This movie spends a lot of time with these characters, but it's really hard to remember their actual names. Honestly it wouldn't be that ill advised to say these characters mean very little, at least as their personalities are concerned. But that's kind of the point; as they get deeper in they find themselves being completely, and unintentionally surrounded by the disgusting reality of what the church is doing. They are simply representations of the actual spotlight crew that found the truth as been around every person. This films likes doing reveals, appropriately. There are several instances where camera and editing choices reveal the true damage or gravity of this situation. Sometimes a character will just blurt out commentary over the imagery either right away, or late. Spotlight members relationships with other people can also be spelled out too much. Specifically with someone's (trying not to spoil) blood relative.Also when a Cardinal does something dastardly, the film just kind of shrugs it off. Those things hurt the film in my opinion. But this film does certainly do a good job of not saying some things, for example the emotional state of the reporters is tracked very fluently. When a character feels panicked, rushed, angry, or scared you feel the weight because what the film is saying is dramatic, and you've been following the characters emotions the whole time. Those are all the things in the actual writing and directing I really liked, but there is another reason to watch this film. It's subject. Films like these are important things to watch, we can really take away a lot from it. This film could very well piss you off, if you are a devote follower of God. It tells you that the Church is corrupt, has too much power, and is blindly followed. Or at least at this time it was. It's hard to deny the credibility of the film when you see the final statistics on display in the film. It reminds me of two things. One, Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing. I don't think this movie quite utilizes it's full potential like Do the Right Thing, but they both say something that is tough to swallow. They choose to show the world the state it is certainly in. We aren't perfect but we can at least try to do something. The second thing I am reminded of is a quote from Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. Alex is watching brutal violence, rape, and the Nazi regime and he says \"its funny how the colors of the real world, only feel really real when you vivid them on a screen\". I think he mean we can only learn from what is in front of us. Well that's it God Bless you.",

The only movie I have ever seen like this is All the President's Men.  Granted, that had the whole government aspect, but the Catholic Church, especially in Boston, is a quasi government.  Spotlight makes one sad that real investigative journalism is on the decline in this country, due to all of the corporate mergers of newspapers and their goals.  But it highlights an important and unique role the media can, and truly should, play in our society.",

This is the best,“Spotlight” is a MUST SEE for many reasons first being that if you think you know everything, or just a lot, about the cover-up regarding the Catholic church and the pedophilia priests this film will show you that you don’t. This is the best, if not better, newsroom movie since “All The President’s Men” and shows investigative reporting as it is done and what it accomplishes. The cast is an evenly matched crew of actors in their prime and though all should get an Oscar for best ensemble, there is a scene with Mark Ruffalo that will make you hold your breath not wanting to miss a word.\r Ruffalo is one member of a team consisting of  editor Michael Keaton who is the leader and Rachel McAdams along with Brian d’Arcy James who answer to managing editor John Slattery and they all have  a new Jewish, single, editor-in-chief  previously of New York and Miami Live Schreiber.\r This is not a pounding on the desk, “STOP THE PRESSES” but an even moving film of reporters doing research, asking inquisitive, invasive questions. There are quiet but very effective scenes like that between Schreiber and Len Cariou as Cardinal Law or the reporters interviewing survivors such as Neil Huff , or Richard O’Rourke, a priest who molested children but saw nothing wrong with it and in both cases no histrionics. Whether it is lawyers like Jamey Sheridan and Stanley Tucci or members of the church like Paul Guulfoyle or supporting players such as Billy Crudup and Michael Cyril Creighton among others all deliver the goods.\r Screenwriters Josh Singer and Tom McCarthy, the latter also directed, make a mystery and create suspense tale of a fairly well known Pulitzer Prize winning story that will get you deeply involved.\r “Spotlight” is definitely one of the best movies of the year!",

It takes a very difficult subject matter and handles it very well.  I think it could have gone one step further with it, but by the end it does feel like a very good movie.  To borrow a quote from Kyle Kallgren from Brows Held High, the bravery showing the film is not the reporters breaking the story, but it’s the holding on of the story until they have all the facts straight so that they can really make a difference and I don’t think I could sum it up better myself, hence my borrowing that quote.  It’s very well acted and its a decently written film.  It has a couple of issues, particularly with it’s early pacing and it does feel a bit too much like it’s deliberately aiming for an Oscar, but it’s a lot better than many other films that fit that category.  It’s a really good drama, however I wouldn’t recommend rushing to the cinema to see this one, you might want to wait for this one to come out on DVD.  It’s just good, that’s what I would say.  I’m not sure I would give it the Oscar for best picture, which I don’t suspect it will win, the bookies are predicting The Revenant at this point and they are probably right, but I wouldn’t mind if this one stole it on the day.",

Interestingly, you won't find that here. \"Spotlight\" is very subdued. It features a Mark Ruffalo performance on par with his work in Begin Again, proving just how versatile he is and how passionate he can be. Michael Keaton is tasteful, graceful, and maybe even a little boring, but in a good way; it's as if his acting career has been completely reinvented after Birdman. Besides those two things, this movie wasn't what I expected it to be. Upon exiting the theater, I remarked this exactly: \"It feels like a great story about a great newspaper story about a terrible story.\" In other words, you might have felt much more suspense if you had read the Boston Globe article back in 2002. I assumed the point of this film was to tell the story that might have been drowned out by the attacks of 9/11, and I was right. With this, the underlying story feels more important than the film, but it is very well done and well acted. I would absolutely go to see it in the theater, but I would manage my expectations somewhat. If it's plot you're banking on, you'll be disappointed.

The depiction of Boston is spot-on, for anybody who has lived there and knows the place. I think it is better than All the President's men. How could it have been better? I think slightly more development of some characters where you felt a bit more personal investment in them, and where you believed even more that they were personally affected by the unfolding events.

Religion plays a role in this narrative as it naturally contrasts and opposes the scandalous nature of the cases highlighted in this movie.

The movie develop two big topics, the first one is about predator priests molesting children and the hierarchy of the church covering up their actions; the second one is about investigative journalism and how we has mankind depend on it in order to reveal conspiracy and abuse to ourselves. The mixture between both results on a thrilling plot, full with suspense and that certainly will make you question the church as an organization all the way up the pope. This incurable illness plus the ineptitude of church authorities left a mark of self-esteem problems, personality disorders, trust issues and even suicidal behavior on hundreds of people. It reaches a point when society looks at the topic as a failing to place children out of priests, and not backwards, it assumes that is impossible in the other way.

We hate romantic comedies based entirely on misunderstandings, we hate horror films where no one's cell phone works,  or we simply hate movies that have either the word Adam or Sandler on the poster.I hate true story movies that simply make things up. You know the type. We need a bad guy so let's take a real person and turn him into a racist (Hidden Figures), a murderer (Titanic), or a woman (Patch Adams). We need to condense the timeline and change real historical events (Oscar-nominated Hidden Figures again). We need to change the character's sexuality so modern audiences can relate (The Danish Girl). We need facist slaveholders to talk about democracy and freedom (300). And the list goes on and on. This is without even mentioning Mel Gibson historical dramas that might as well have dinosaurs wandering through them.One of my other pet peeves? Movies that take place in an office or business world made by people who clearly have never spent more than a day working in one. Like ahistorical true stories, this is ripe territory for rage. We have the office politics of Catwoman’s evil beauty cream manufacturer. Not to be outdone the less said about how Wayne Industries is run ( a publicly traded company mind you) in the Batman universe the better. It isn’t just superhero movies either. Romantic comedies often need a trip to HR and no making everyone an architect does not solve that. (Seriously do these movies even know what architects or museum directors or magazine publishers actually do during their work day?)Spotlight easily could have fallen into both these traps. It simply doesn’t. The timeline is correct. The discussions between professionals sound well professional. There are no made up heavy’s to create drama, no fake romantic love interest, no surprise terrorist attack. Okay, it does have the last one but in all fairness, the movie’s timeline starts in August 2001 and runs through the end of the year. But even in that moment, the movie handles it with intelligence and in a realistic manner. There is a calmness and a professionalism in this movie that is refreshing.

The ensemble really works well for this story, but I'll be shocked if we see Oscar nominations for these actors because there is no one who really takes the lead. Mark Ruffalo has truly done everything this year. He's been comedic with Infinitely Polar Bear. He's been a box office draw with Avengers: Age of Ultron and he may be the only actor in the film that gets Oscar consideration. To me he was the stand out. Michael Keaton shows that his comeback role in Birdman was no fluke. Not only is Keaton back but he is better than ever. Then you have Rachel McAdams who shows some dramatic chops and it seems like she becomes more and more dependable as her career continues.

Spotlight holds nothing back, features an ensemble of amazing performances, and tells a haunting true story. This story is recent enough that many people probably still remember, but old enough that many people will probably find it educational.\rPerhaps the film’s greatest strength is it’s story, which is incredibly dense with information. Not to spoil the film, but to give context the film is about a large scandal involving the Boston Catholic Priests in 2001. The story is so dense that it would have been easy to hold back information or gloss over plot elements, but somehow the filmmakers behind this film were able to fit it all into the film, in just over 2 hours. The film is unapologetically real, despite the occasional moments of theatricality, which all films have.\rThe entire cast is magnificent in this film, lead by Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton. Both of which will probably receive Oscar nominations for back-to-back years. In a film that relies on a slow-burn approach, with a more emotional grip on the audience, the acting was paramount, and the entire cast delivered. It’s most impressive, because they are able to every moment and make it feel important through their portrayals. These performances also help to make the characters feel more real, and relatable.\rThe performances support one other major strength of the film, which is the haunting tone of the film. The film is scary in an very real way, as the film showcases that even in large hubs with millions of people, massive secrets can be hidden. At a time with drones, and widespread public mistrust it makes the film even scarier. It’s the haunting story and tone that helps elevate the acting, to form a truly great film.\rIn the end the film tells a relevant story that every american should know, without compromising its source material. Spotlight is a film so good that even the churches it condemned had to admit that it was great. The film will likely receive a lot of award recognition, and rightfully so, as it stands as one of the best movies of 2015. It’s a haunting film that tells a story so compelling and unbelievable it becomes a must see film.",

It's a film that draws parallels with the 70's Classic, All The President's Men, which also dealt with a massive conspiracy, but this time governmental (leading right up to President Nixon).\rThis film, unfortunately, doesn't have that amount of punch to it, even if the subject matter is probably even more disturbing. This is mainly because the film pulls punches when dealing with the actual explanations of the abuse itself, and focuses too much on the exposition and not enough on the characters.\r I came away wanting to know more, especially about the contents of a set of 'sealed files' which they are eventually able to get hold of a portion, but we're just offered a 45 second summary, and then the reaction that it creates in the Spotlight news office.\r Also, the ending is very anticlimactic, especially during the final build-up to, and then the publication of the news story in 2002, finishing with a 'phones ringing off the hook' fade-out.....\r I was hoping for much more of an epilogue, so we could see how the events after publication affected the people who we'd been following through the movie. Not just those working for the Globe, but the larger 'co-stars' in the film who had contributed to uncovering the conspiracy and cover up....\r Still, it's well worth watching, just don't expect to find it revelatory in any way.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nIt is interesting that the public give less credit than the \"Critics\" to this movie. I agree with the public.\r Although it is a good movie, once you compared it to  \"All President's Men\" you can feel that something is missing. A movie is not based on the conglomerate of good actors and good settings and a good director. It is the amusing combination of all of them  that enchants the receptor. In this case though, it is the topic, and not the movie, what guides the spectator until the end.The topic itself: the gruesome case about those abused victims by sick priests and how the institution -and the society- managed the crime, and how the journal brought it to the light.  Was the intention here the film of a crusade?  the connection between a strong faith based community and a cruel reality?  Was the disapproval of the Catholic Church \"as an institution\"?  I am not so clear. In any case, the silence presence of the victims guide the movie.\r I feel that Spotlight fails in one essential point -because of the subjects developed there: missing the opportunity to go deeply into the question of faith and free will. It touched it somehow, yes, but as a small advertising that you could find in any printed newspaper. It does not go there.  And faith is for example what drove Rezendes to stop going to Church -no clear explanation why; what Sacha's relatives feel touched -no further inquiry about it; and what it is in the heart of the Bostonian community -no particular discussion about that.  Only big names and a big newspaper.\r The church is something different than faith, I agree; but if you are going to treat this particular subject as just \"the institution\" the result is like filming nature without showing wilderness.\r Even the history was not well re-scripted; it seems that the journalists are driven by assignment not by guts; and guts is what you need to explore with more anguish as well as impecable touch this case  to be considered an excellent movie. Also, I could not detached myself the entire movie from recognizing  director's influences rather than an creative opera, it was like watching \"The Social Network\" applied to this well deserved better construction.\r A good movie, not an excellent film.",

First off, the performances of the main cast are phenomenal, they are absolutely phenomenal. Mark Ruffalo, (especially) Micheal Keaton and Racheal McAdams give exceptional performances that will leave you in awe. Those performances also mixed with the chemistry and at time exciting dialogue. I say “at times” because at times the pacing is slow and it seems that at that exact same time that the filler scenes/jokes come in. When I say jokes I legitimately mean jokes. They try to make such a dark tale a comedy to such an extreme extent to where you start to notice the pauses where people were supposed to laugh. In the end, what can I say?

Many will be familiar with at least some aspects of the story, but that doesn't matter since the movie tells the tale in an engrossing manner.  Very strong ensemble cast with every actor giving a laudable performance.  Schreiber, Keaton and Ruffalo stand out.  It has pacing of the standard investigative journalism film, which could frustrate some viewers, yet never seemed slow or boring to me.  Instead, the viewer is quickly drawn into a \"cover up\" of voluminous proportions and the reporters attempt to unravel a conspiracy.  Although my family and I were deeply moved, the only minor criticism is that the film leaves opportunities to affect viewer's emotions even further on the table.  More focus on the victims and the indelible scars left on both they and their families would have made for an even more affecting film.

Liev Schrieber disappears into his role almost completely (this is a compliment) and I am now convinced that Michael Keaton can indeed act and Birdman was no fluke. Also especially fine are Mark Ruffolo and Rachel McAdams. These are intelligent actors, but the director coaxes out of them a higher level of nuance, complexity, and humanity than they have achieved before. You believe them and forget they are actors you’ve seen many dozens of times. It’s a solid script (the quality of the ensemble writing reminded me of Margin Call), and most amazing of all you learn new things about a subject you’ve heard about many time – children abused by Catholic priests. You understand that there was a cockeyed logic behind it all – but, of course, understanding does not make it any less despicable.",

If a character isn't Irish and Catholic by default at least one person per scene, in the case of Stanley Tucci, its himself, will mention the character's race or religion, for no other reason than to question why they care about why the Catholic Church does what it does, and it's a very \"outsiders cause trouble\" mentality. The performances are uneven, you get solid Keaton and Slattery, but there are no real characters for them, they're the straight men. Ruffalo's accent slips in and out of every scene, but he manages to keep it together for a big scene, standing up to Keaton, but you can't give an award for once scene when the rest of the performance is shoddy (unless its Anne Hathaway singing in a close up). I wanted to like Rachel McAdams more in this, she has a \"Your Girl Friday\" attitude, but its also because she's effectively the only female character in the entire film. The most interesting performance in the film is from Brian d'Arcy James, you know, that one guy in the movie you probably have no idea who is, with the eyebrows and the mustache, that's in more of the film than Liev Schreiber, who plays the new EIC of the Boston Globe who puts the Spotlight investigative team on the Catholic Molestation case in the first place. The film has a downer ending, and endings for Bio-Pics or based on true events films, are hard, because if you follow the news, generally you know how they're going to end, going in. With this, the article is front page of the Sunday Edition, and the film ends with post script cards telling how more than 1000 victims came forward after the article was written and then lists all the cities around the world where molestation involving the Catholic Church have taken place. The film was produced by Participant Media, which, their mission statement is to make films that matter, and most of their films are quite good, Spotlight came off as a hollow procedural and was almost more montage than narrative.",

This is an important issue and we should be happy that film makers are willing to do this and make it clear that the church hierarchy was guilty. There has been a study showing that priests are no more likely than other men to be child molesters, however, they have far more access to children than most men have. Therefore, they are far more dangerous on average. The church failed miserably in protecting children, it probably is still failing and still trying to protect itself and its people rather than children.",

It stars Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, John Slattery, Rachel McAdams and Leiv Schrieber (who looks like he should have taken 2 No-Doze pills before his parts were shot).. The film tells the story of the investigative team of  reporters on The Boston Globe (called \"Spotlight\") and how they uncovered the scandal in the Catholic Church involving the molestation and abuse of children by priests and the efforts made to cover up those transgressions by the Church hierarchy. The real \"star\" of the film is this most interesting story of how an institution so beloved and respected by its community could be made to be held accountable for these unconscionable acts engaged in by its representatives.. With all due respect to the performances of Messrs. Keaton and Ruffalo and Ms. McAdams,, the film takes too long to tell its story and is definitely a \"look at my watch\" experience. Nevertheless, the importance of the subject matter and the tenacity of those investigating and ultimately writing the story that won their paper a Pulitzer Prize makes it a film worth seeing. I give the film a 7.5 rating because, even after acknowledging its importance, it still remains an entertainment vehicle that should have left at least 20 minutes of it on the editing room floor.",

More specificallySlow, surprisingly muted and almost overwhelmingly disappointing. This year’s Oscar front runner for best picture deals with The Boston Globe newspaper’s expose of the dirty dealings and hypocrisies of the Catholic Church. More specifically it hones in on the sexual molestation of young boys by Catholic priests. However, despite this controversial hot potato of a subject the film seriously lacks any raw power or urgency. Instead it is content to have its leading investigators amble from meeting to meeting obtaining information rather too easily. Things aren’t helped by the lack of an emotional hook. The victims interviewed are all adults and come across as basic stock characters shouldering all the worst lines of dialogue like ‘Who can say no to god’. Lines like this are so phony that one winces with embarrassment. Anyone who has seen ‘All the President’s Men’ or Netflix’s current ‘Making a Murderer’ will know that films exposing evil or corruption can be nerve jinglingly tense and emotively powerful, but Mark Ruffalo’s annoying depiction of righteous anger just doesn’t cut it. Where the film does succeed is in keeping viewer interest in a subplot as to who in Spotlight’s department was responsible, and therefore complicit, in burying the story years earlier. Performance wise the Oscar nominated turns of both Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams seem quite conventional and uninteresting, whereas the actors in smaller parts; Liev Schreiber, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup and John Slattery all fare much better. The ‘Spotlight’, however, does shine on one person; Michael Keaton. For an actor who is often guilty of being way over the top he is here at his most understated. It is more than fair to say that he single handedly elevates ‘Spotlight’ to a level way above the mediocrity of the rest of the film.",

Professional reviewers are gushing over Spotlight.  This is often a “tell” that a movie isn’t very appealing to large swaths of the general movie-going public, and such is the case here.  Despite a good cast, decent acting and intelligent dialogue, the movie is just plain boring.\r Spotlight explains how a small team of investigative reporters at a “local” newspaper (The Boston Globe) uncovered, and eventually reported on, Catholic Priests molesting children in the Boston area.  If you’ve read a newspaper in the last 10 years you already know the basic story:  Church hierarchy was not only aware of the problem, but had been covering it up for decades.  The breaking of the story led to subsequent revelations that the abuse inflicted by these Catholic priests on their parishioners wasn’t an isolated incident limited to the Boston area.  It’s a world-wide plague.\r It’s almost impossible to be oppugnant of a movie whose subject matter is so poignant.  The problem is that Spotlight just isn’t that interesting, unless you are Catholic, a newspaper writer, or from the Boston area.  Most of us would expect a movie about such atrocities to answer the basic question, who is responsible?  We might also expect a movie in which Good ultimately triumphs over Evil, and the Bad are brought to justice.  Spotlight painstakingly avoids the later and the typical Hollywood happy ending.\r Instead, the movie is an introspection which attempts to focus on identifying how something so disgusting and so widespread could have gone on for so long.  The movie answers this question in an unexpected manner that is the ultimate indictment of Catholic orthodoxy, which seeks to imbue the faithful with a belief that the church is both inherently good and infallible in its decision making (and thus is not to be questioned) and that man, who is born sinful, should feel guilty about everything that he does (or in this case, doesn’t do).\r The only real tension in the movie comes when the audience learns that information about priests molesting children was previously sent to the newspaper many years ago, but the newspaper failed to act on it, and that someone may have deliberately buried it.  We continually wait for this play out, only to discover in highly anticlimactic fashion that the inaction was probably inadvertent (or maybe subconsciously suppressed and ignored).\r We are left with the idea that the catholic community of Boston (which is portrayed as a fiercely prideful and tightknit community) knew or should have known what was going on for all those years and thus, the community bears significant responsible for the decades of delay in stopping the abuse.\r While I appreciate the irony that a Catholic community is made up of individuals who, as a result of church teachings, are permeated with a sense of guilt, and thus might blame themselves for not outing their own child molesting priests on a more-timely basis, I didn’t view this movie as involving some grand revelation, I saw it more as a movie about mental self-flagellation.",
