  "critic_reviews": [
    "This is the kind of movie where you can anticipate the next big shock and it usually arrives right on cue, and yet it still gets you right in the gut.",
    "Occasionally the camera gets jumbled around, blacks out, and hisses with static as if it had been tossed in a dryer. Then it regains composure and reveals — an old playbill! A figure in a mask with a noose! The birth of a new franchise and the death of a great genre.",
    "Lofing and Cluff certainly know the found-footage ropes, and the tropes; we'll see if their next project reveals a little more imagination.",
    "Plot holes aside, the filmmakers provide enough well-timed jumps and energetic moments to keep the highly contained picture afloat.",
    "A movie that has two good ideas. It needed three.",
    "This is another found-footage movie that, with a little art direction and some actual cinematography, could easily have been a decent little terrorizer. Instead, it comes mostly unglued thanks to its hacky gimmick.",
    "The Gallows is only good enough to make you wish its creators did something novel with its formulaic style, plot, and characterizations.",
    "The horror movie The Gallows starts with a decent if improbable premise, and it ends with a pretty good jolt. But in between, the film sure wears out the already tired found-footage device.",
    "Any film that tries to revive this technique needs a clever story or unusual filmmaking ingenuity to stand out from the crowd. The Gallows has neither. It has enough mild scares to captivate the under-25 crowd.",
    "The film is sstrictly a high-tech spin on one of those Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.",
    "The Gallows is not without thrills. What it lacks is the thrill of the chase.",
    "Making audiences care about the characters is always a more effective fear-generating strategy than just knocking off a bunch of dimwits in the dark.",
    "The Gallows isn’t without a certain amount of atmosphere, it simply feels borrowed wholesale. That would matter less with a better script, but the four main characters are paper-thin even by genre norms.",
    "The Gallows offers up few new ideas and very few genuine scares.",
    "A ridiculous fusion of \"Paranormal Activity\" and \"Glee\" that is so incredibly dumb that it is almost, but never quite, scary to behold.",
    "It would be easy to spend hours trashing The Galllows if it just wasn’t so disposable.",
    "If you’re not laughing at this, early and often, you’re made of sterner stuff than the players they paid to show up for this, but didn’t.",
    "After several tedious jump scares and boneheaded escape plans, a bag over your head won't seem like such a bad idea. Or the noose.",
    "Sorry, but this kind of high-school horror was old when Jamie Lee Curtis was young. All the ugly, shaky, night-vision camerawork in the world will not make it seem fresh. Or remotely scary.",
    "It is a singularly unpleasant experience, not because it is scary or extreme or even interesting. It is unpleasant because it is a dull story filled with characters that are so poorly drawn as to be forgettable even while you're watching them.",
    "Even by the modest standards of the genre, the ending is jaw-droppingly ridiculous.",
    "The Gallows offers exactly none of the frisson or pleasure of a found-footage film done right."

Even those who haven't seen many films could name a couple of similar films. The best ones. The worst part was, in horror films, ten guys go in and only one comes out. Sometimes none. The found-footage presentation was okay for such concept. The film was short and one day event based. Most of the story was on the night in an auditorium. The initial part had fair space to kick-start the tale with a simple intro. And then the following event did not stay up to the buildup.The basic storyline itself was very weak. The characters, and their behaviours, all easily gives out the upcoming scenes. So predictable, even the twist was ordinary. The way it ended was worse than ordinary. I felt the final scene with the cops was totally unnecessary. There's nothing wrong with the actors. Even filmmaking was acceptable. But I don't know how the production company okayed the screenplay. One of the low cost film, but earned better. Despite not received well by all the quarters. I would always encourage such small films, but I can't suggest it.2/10",

I got one last thing to state, don't go see this movie, if you really want to, just pirate it. This piece of crap does not deserve money.

FromI walked into \"The Gallows\" with pretty low expectations. The found footage genre only has a few greats, such as, \"The Blair Witch Project\", \"Paranormal Activity\", \"Rec\", and \"As Above So Below\". However, this movie was quite a surprise. From the originality to the story, to the execution of the masked killer, a.k.a. Charlie, the film did an excellent job. Horror movies aren't about the jump scares, they are about how the director(s) build up the atmosphere. Even though this film did have some jump scares, I was really impressed by the way the atmosphere was created. It takes place in a high school during the dead of night. I never realized how terrifying that could be. The use of the exit signs illuminating the halls with its blood red glow really stood out to me. I also enjoyed the fact that it wasn't just told from one point of view. There were multiple cameras that allowed the viewer to move deeper into the story without having to be subject to just one point of view. Each character had their own personality, which is hard to come by nowadays. And, Charlie, scared the hell out me. Now, it wasn't the best horror film I've ever seen, but it was effective and I would recommend it to all of you hardcore horror fans.",

With a 4.7 on IMDb based on only 164 ratings, a 16% on rotten tomatoes and a 31 on metacritic, you'd expect this to be a complete disaster. Fortunately, The Gallows is a surprisingly intense and effective little found footage flick that has a few good scares up its sleeve. The Gallows is a supernatural found footage film about a group of teenagers who break into their school the night before a play, appropriately titled \"The Gallows\", so that the show can't go on. However, 20 years earlier, a freak accident happened during the same play that resulted in the death of Charlie Grimelle, the star of the show. For the most part, this film is rather tight and controlled. Clocking in at a criminally short 81 minutes, this does allow the movie to move at a pretty brisk pace, but a few scenes do feel rather rushed. Some of the scares do fall flat because of this and go for a jump scare that would have been much more effective if there wasn't a \"big whoosh sound\". Other than those few scenes, there are quite a few well-timed jump scares and a lot of incredibly intense and scary scenes that, luckily, don't end on a dramatic jump scare. Watching the four characters roaming the dark, empty corridors of their school is rather unnerving, especially when they find hidden rooms underneath the school. The sound also makes this movie very atmospheric and unsettling. The Gallows isn't without its glaring problems. This movie definitely won't win any awards in the originality department, and the acting (something I usually never mention) is largely uneven from a couple of the cast members, but the worst thing about The Gallows is the atrocity that is the ending. I don't want to spoil anything, but the big plot twist at the end was insanely predictable and cheesy. It was almost as if the filmmakers couldn't come up with a decent way to end the movie, so they just wrapped it up with some lame plot twist that makes no sense at all. That might have been why this was only 81 minutes. The worst thing about the ending is that it actually created more questions than it answered, which really frustrated my friend and me. Despite the absolutely awful ending, The Gallows does not deserve the scorn it's been getting on the Internet. It's a very intense and sometimes scary movie, and it's definitely a movie you'll want to watch in the theater.",

The performances are fine enough, and if you want to spend another 80 minutes of your life exploring the psyches of bratty teenagers, you can.\r At its best, though, the movie creates a sense of verisimilitude sufficient to sell its jump scares.

Found footage genre has been stifled with persistent issues, and this one isn't so different. The movie focuses on the production of high school play of the same name. It is the first time after twenty years that it's been produced, since the last one ends up with actual hanging. Soon enough several teens pack their camera and cell phones then decide to prank the production.\r First problem is the man behind the camera, Ryan. In some found footage films, the cameraman is usually a narrator or protagonist. Ryan is the rare few who are incredibly unlikeable and borderline aggravating. Audience literally spends the first act hearing him berate and undermine other students, even his best friend and girlfriend.\r I understand the need to portray brash youthful attitude, but that doesn't mean it has to be deliberately irritating to a fault. In some scenes he chooses stupid decisions, the very opposite of logical choice of actions. Other characters are imbalanced as well. Since the movie works on a small main cast, it relies much too heavily on these young characters. Their actions and motives are seemingly glossed over and erratic most of the times.\r There just isn't enough material to sustain the backstory of this play. It seems petty and rather vague to be identifiable, even the supposed entity isn't that novel, nearly looking like any other villain from slasher flick. Still, the nocturnal running and screaming must go on. For that matter, the movie actually delivers a few good build-ups.\r It's nothing inventive, but the large stage and myriad of props give it some advantage. A play itself is detached from reality, so at the very least it justifies the strange fantasy horror angle and it could have worked more with it. Furthermore, the backstage and school environments are striking chilling given the right ambiance.\r Despite the fine set-up, it doesn't deliver any spectacular finale, or any satisfying pay-off at all. In the end the whole thing feels like actual high school play, relatively tolerable if audience is lenience, but honestly rather tedious and shoddy. The Gallows dangles mild eerie atmosphere but eventually choke on its sloppy presentation and overly shallow delivery.",

Plot holes are aplenty, jumpscares are floundered by the typical jumpscare noises you'd find in a standard studio horror movie (which really doesn't make sense because this is a FOUND FOOTAGE horror film, why would it have a score?)and also features incredibly unlike-able characters that makes this movie an unwatchable mess at times. A really bad 2/10",
