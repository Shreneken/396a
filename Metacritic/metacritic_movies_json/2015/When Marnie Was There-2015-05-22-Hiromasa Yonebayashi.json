  "critic_reviews": [
    "There is a quality of enchantment to When Marnie Was There that can’t be faked, and that the studio behind this animated feature is justifiably famous for.",
    "The animation is dazzling.",
    "A gentle tale, tinged with melancholy told with all the loving attention to detail you expect from Studio Ghibli.",
    "It deals with friendship, loneliness, abandonment and forgiveness, and though its curious narrative arc means you're never sure exactly where it's going, the film works up a considerable emotional charge by the end.",
    "It’s a quiet film of modest narrative ambitions and simple shifts. But its technical and visual ambitions couldn’t be higher. It’s as if Ghibli is still trying to raise its own bar, so that even if it’s going out, it’s reminding viewers what they’d be missing.",
    "At its most beautiful, Yonebayashi's picture is about the magic of female friendship at its purest.",
    "Yonebayashi’s open-hearted tale, more than any other Ghibli offering, could conceivably have worked just as well in live-action, and yet the tender story gains so much from the studio’s delicate, hand-crafted approach.",
    "A bit too familiar, and at times gentle to a fault.",
    "Deserves to be considered on its own merits, and while not a masterpiece, it is beautiful, nonetheless.",
    "The film’s depiction of loss, isolation and reconciliation, and the rewards of friendship, grows more touching as the story builds to its highly emotional conclusion.",
    "Though the narrative of “Marnie” bogs down toward the end, this does not diminish its spell.",
    "It’s not the predictability that’s disappointing as much as the pat resolutions and emotional fixes provided to Anna. If you’re going to set up a young character who’s this complicated and in this much pain, you owe her a similarly complex catharsis.",
    "It is filled with the luscious, beautiful 2D animation that we’ve come to expect from Ghibli, and if the storytelling sometimes gets a bit lethargic for its own good, we’re more forgiving just to have one final dance in the moonlight.",
    "Subtle, sometimes really sad and honest about the struggles of adolescence, Marnie is a worthy last entry from Ghibli before the studio reportedly goes on hiatus.",
    "The film at first plays like a refresher and throwback to Hayao Miyazaki's Kiki's Delivery Service, before revealing itself to be less minimal than minor.",
    "There are no princesses, monsters or castles in the sky, but that doesn't mean there is no magic.",
    "When Marnie Was There may start off a bit awkwardly, but it'll have you bathing in your own tears by the time it's over.",
    "The conclusion is rushed and poorly staged, yet the damp caul of loneliness that envelops the film’s early scenes feels moving and true.",
    "A beautifully animated tale of the growing friendship and occasionally rather cloying emotional travails of two 12-year-old girls.",
    "As a children’s movie, it’s uncommonly sensitive and complicated, rooted in relationships rather than dazzling action. But adults may notice its simple poetry turning, after a while, to suds.",
    "This is, disappointingly, a long way from being a Studio Ghibli classic. The essential plot may be archetypal, but it’s no \"Kiki’s Delivery Service.\"",
    "Director Hiromasa Yonebayashi did a wonderful job adapting “The Borrowers” into “The Secret World of Arriety.” But this slow-moving film, also from a book, tends to plod rather than float."

Anna is an orphan but I always got confused on who the two elderly were, but it's not important: what is important is that Annah is sick and prefers being alone and drawing, and during a summer festival (which I forgot the name...I apologize but I'm not very good at those japanese names) she offends another girl and flees to a lake she saw earlier, where a big western looking house resides: in this place she'll encounter a young blonde haired girl called Marnie, together creating a bond of true friendship...and hopefully nothing else, considering some  scenes were quite weird to look, with lots of hugs and intimate moments such as dancing, blushing and (in my version), even telling her \"I love you\". Whatever it's the case, it doesn't go any further which is sort of a lost potential of self discovery, especially in terms of gender but instead it focuses on the friedship aspect, which is confusing to say the least.\r Until the very end, we never know who or what Marnie is and the viewer just think she's a ghost...and I won't spoil this of course but once the ending approaches, -everything- will fit to its place and finally Anna will become self aware and fully complete of herself, finally understanding her anger and her solitude.\r Overall, I loved this movie and despite it's missed messages, its confusion and sometimes boring parts I truely enjoyed this movie, and I'm glad that they left us a fine piece of art before taking their momentarily break from movie making.\r Such a shame we will have to wait a long time before we can witness another great work of the Studio Ghibli, but as an \"final\" movie for the moment (again, momentarily) it's a very good one and I highly recommend it.\r Just be careful: you might be confused the first time watching it.",

It's a puzzle movie. I adore this film. This is one of only a few movies I have ever seen that made me tear up, and make me want to cry. While it's probably aimed mostly at mothers to watch with their daughters, anyone who enjoys good films should love this masterpiece.I do have to say though that I prefer the Japanese version with English subtitles to the English language version for two reasons.\r 1: While I think Hailee Steinfeld is an amazing young actress (no one will ever play Mattie Ross in True Grit better), she is too old to play the lead character, Anna, in my opinion. Her voice seems too deep. Again, nothing against her, she's an amazing actress.\r 2: There is one specific line in this film that made me tear up and get a big lump in my throat. In the dubbed version, the line is spoken softly, which is fine. But in the original language version, the line is almost screamed, and is just way more emotional. It's like a knife to the heart, whereas the English version lacks the same level of emotion.\r But whatever version you see, it is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, not just story-wise, but also in the gorgeous hand-drawn animation, and the emotional score. I very strongly recommend When Marnie Was There. I am upset that this could be Studio Ghibli's final film, but it is certainly a good way to go out.",

I loved it so much, this film was so fantastically written, so fantastically animated and it was a joy to experience.  I loved the characters, the story line was great and engaging the mood is set perfectly.  The characters are designed brilliantly, it’s just an all round excellent film and it doesn’t appear that too much has been lost in translation between Britain and Japan.\r If this is to be the final film from Studio Ghibli, they are going out on a high because this film was excellent and really should have won the Oscar for Best Animated Film.  I liked Inside Out but for goodness sake, this film was way better.  This is just a lovely movie, I cannot recommend it enough if it is playing in your area and it doesn’t matter which format you see it in because the dub cast do an excellent job with their performances and I am certain the Japanese cast do an excellent job too from what I have heard.  It’s up there with the best Studio Ghibli movies, like Spirited Away, Howl’s Moving Castle, The Wind Rises and many others.  It really deserves to be in with them.\r When I left the cinema I was both happy and sad because I knew this was the last time I got to see a new Studio Ghibli film in the cinema and while I am glad to have seen a great movie, I am sad to see this studio go because I know there will probably never be a collective group of creators like them in my lifetime.",

This is what I call a fine adaptation, greatFrom the director Hiromasa Yonebayashi of 'The Secret World of Arriety' fame. Based on the 1967 English novel of the same name and so the important characters borrowed the western names. This is what I call a fine adaptation, great transformation from the words to the motion picture. Actually, it suited for the narration from the standpoint of Japanese culture and lifestyle, especially for this anime version with the beautiful fictional coastal landscapes. Whenever I remember this film in the future, that Marsh house would be the first thing to pop out in my mind, an unforgettable landmark for sure.\r The movie promos were damp. The posters were not that impressive, but okay and the trailer was very ordinary. Studio Ghibli was the reason to go for it, so I expected nothing spectacular from the movie. Even while I was watching, I thought it was just an enjoyable mystery flick, but you know sometime the value of the whole movie comes at the end twist. Once the end was near my stance changed, especially after the hidden truth revelation. Some movies need a re-watch to terminate any doubts regarding characters and scenes. As for this movie, if your focus is straight, then it's does not require.\r Not a technical brilliance like the director's previous movie, but the story was strong and twisty. The characters were very interesting, suspense was the movie's influence for the audience to stick till the end. There is no loose end, certainly gives a few topics to discuss about, but the narration moves on a circular track and hits back like the boomerang. That does not mean it is a time travel or something. The narration bends and blends with the time. To realise what is real and what is not, you have to wait till the end. After seeing the film, I understood everyone's childhood memories could monopolize if we encounter same object, place, person and other things again in the later life. Yes, I had few minor experience in my life as well.\r The opening dialogue itself a hint of what kind of movie it is going to be. There are two prominent girls, Anna and Marnie in the story, like the Anna and Elsa from 'Frozen'. The narration flips on a regular basis to tell the multiple layered story. As this film was a puzzle in portrayal, obviously viewers try to solve it, including me. I tried my best. I thought Anna's childhood toy was something to do with all the fuss, but I was terribly wrong. That was a perfect divert if you observe it closely. In another perspective, I kept 'The Others' and 'The Orphanage' in mind, but was not even close to where this story was heading. Whether you succeed or not, very fun to solve a mystery, you know. Finally, it gave me full satisfaction like that indirectly I saw 'The Uninvited' once again.\r Feels like the Oscars was concluded yesterday, but I am already thinking about the next one. If I am not wrong this movie is definitely one of the contenders for the best animation race, along with 'The Good Dinosaur' probably. Absolutely, I would be disappointed if I don't see it in the final five. There is lots of time between now and then, so anything might happen, who knows. After all, this film has already won my little heart and millions of other's. I know no one can replace Mr. Miyazaki, but feels like Hiromasa Yonebayashi could come near if his future projects as much effective as his one. Best of luck to him and he's only a 41. But remember Isao Takahat is 80 and still in the race, yet to announce his retirement. And this film was very close to his 'Only Yesterday'.\r I love you more than any girl I've ever known.\r Studio Ghibli is like Disney Studio from the east. As we know, narrating a fairy tale having the tween girls in the lead is what they're famous for. The previous couple of movies were out of their trademark, so, happy they are back with this masterwork. At a same time I am very very very very sad, because it's their final movie after the 30 years of triumph. Since Hayao Miyazaki's retirement everything falling apart from the studio's management. They've given reasons and it is only a temporary, though hope the rise of 3D animation is not the one to halt the production, praying for the pause to be lifted soon.\r This film is not just passing through from this giant anime production house, but it is a masterpiece. As usual, it is a girly movie and that does not stop grownups, especially men from a watch. I loved it, everytime when I like a movie I express my desire for a sequel and so I did for this film. Though it was one time story with nothing left over for further development, possibly some new thing can be attached to it. Whatever happens this movie will remain as one of the best from the studio and can compete with any modern animations and live-shot masterworks. Highly recommended, not just for anime or animation fans, but for mystery and who love the layers in story narration.\r 9/10",

They start amazingly, but after the half way point they start to get muddled, and pretty pretentious because of what direction the plot is taking. When you get down to it, this film only has one true criticism. It's not long enough to flesh out all of its themes and characters. not including Marnie. But despite that heavy criticism, the film overall is enjoyable. After the first watch you'll definitely have mixed feeling, but by the second watch you'll definitely have a much better time.

It clearly benefits from the pros of every other Studio Ghibli movie: great animation (even if jerky from time to time), colourful design, lovable characters, precise feels, incomprehensible scenes and meaningful ending. However it surprisingly manages to lose a significative part of itself in useless scenes and trivial events. It clearly belongs to this category of films you can simply summarize by the sentence 'it was just a dream'.
