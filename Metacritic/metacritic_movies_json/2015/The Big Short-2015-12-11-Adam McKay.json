  "title": "The Big Short",
  "rating": 8.1,
  "release_date": "2015-12-11",
  "summary": "When four outsiders saw what the big banks, media and government refused to, the global collapse of the economy, they had an idea: The Big Short. Their bold investment leads them into the dark underbelly of modern banking where they must question everyone and everything. [Paramount Pictures]",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The Big Short, which he directed and wrote with Charles Randolph from the book by Michael Lewis, jumps off the screen in every scene and pins an elusive subject firmly in place.",
    "The Big Short is the film that “The Wolf of Wall Street” wanted to be.",
    "It plays the whole absurd shell game for laughs, even as it acknowledges that the last and bitterest laugh is on the rest of us.",
    "Only in America, though, could filmmakers illuminate such a dire subject, and the financial debacle that ensued, with the sort of scathing wit, joyous irreverence and brilliant boisterousness that make The Big Short an improbable triumph.",
    "A true crime story and a madcap comedy, a heist movie and a scalding polemic, The Big Short will affirm your deepest cynicism about Wall Street while simultaneously restoring your faith in Hollywood.",
    "It’s impossible to fathom how writer-director Adam McKay has turned this material into one of the funniest and yet most sobering, not to mention one of the most entertaining movies of 2015.",
    "Simply the most relentlessly entertaining film of the last few months.",
    "I suppose you could call The Big Short a comedy. It’s very, very funny. But it’s also a tragedy. Behind every easy drive-by laugh is a sincere holler of outrage.",
    "The best film of the year? Possibly …",
    "A highly entertaining, informative movie about how the subprime mortgage crisis led to a worldwide financial meltdown in 2007-08. The fact that such a movie is so unusual is one big reason why the meltdown occurred and why it easily could happen again.",
    "The Big Short manages to entertain you while making you really, really mad.",
    "The film packs in so much information and comedy, it would be fun to see it twice: not just to take in what it has to tell us, but also to laugh all over again.",
    "So expert are the performers that you wind up rooting for Burry, Baum, and the others despite yourself, knowing full well that they are fuelled by cynicism -- by an ardent faith that the system will and must fail.",
    "With its cartoonish pace, larger-than-life characters and detours into farce and agitprop, this movie captures the accelerated pace of life in the financial markets and the vast scale of their mendacity far more vividly than a naturalistic drama could.",
    "Taking Michael Lewis’ seminal book about the meltdown as source material, director Adam McKay channels his own anger into something rarely even attempted by Hollywood, let alone pulled off: a comedy about a tragedy.",
    "McKay approaches this adaptation of Michael Lewis’ book with wit, energy and a surprising degree of clarity. But if the movie is a crackerjack entertainment, it’s one with a conscience.",
    "McKay makes moral outrage wickedly entertaining.",
    "The Big Short has a reckless, off-balance energy, with an ending that doesn’t really end the uncertainty: The collapse could happen again, no joke.",
    "See the movie. It’s a treat. And educational, too.",
    "Using gallows humor, likable protagonists, and a variety of nonstandard filmmaking techniques (like having characters address the audience directly), McKay maintains a high level of energy for more than two hours and dares us to become bored.",
    "The Big Short becomes not just amusing and explanatory, a real tour de force for its fast-talking cast.",
    "A hell of a hilarious time at the movies if you're up for laughs that stick in your throat.",
    "It really is quite a movie: entertaining and engaging, but also mortifying; a good alternate title might be \"American Horror Story.\"",
    "McKay's film is coated in sugar to make it go down easy, but at its center, it's a bitter pill to swallow.",
    "In the end, McKay’s edu-tainment tactics work, even if the laughs aren’t as hearty as his broader work with Ferrell. The Big Short pulls off its own oddball gambit: grabbing attention through fringe wonkiness rather than a tantalizing glimpse at bro-banker lifestyles.",
    "The Big Short ends up an energetic, absorbing version of these events, marked deeply by its director’s uniquely surreal vision.",
    "Witty, absurd and far more entertaining than it has any right to be, this could finally shed light on the financial crisis for those of us who found it all too boring to contemplate.",
    "When a Hollywood comedy turns the crime of the century into a lark, you know a huge gamble has been chanced and won.",
    "The Big Short means to infuriate its audience, but it’s smart enough to know that such an approach doesn’t preclude a film from being darkly, cathartically funny as well.",
    "But there is so much information to process in The Big Short that only hedge fund managers and stock brokers will be able to track every nuance and shading of this complicated story.",
    "Only occasionally, as in “Thank You for Smoking” (2005), do these men — and the audience — understand that bucking the system doesn’t always make you less a part of it.",
    "The actors play their roles to the hilt, but in the end, the role of these investors in extenuating the crisis they took advantage of is played down, as is the disastrous life consequences of all those who were severely hit by it.",
    "The film’s compassion for everyday Americans...along with its energetic determination to entertain, enlighten, and infuriate make it a laudable surprise.",
    "Even if it falls a little short as a character study, the fact that it’s both hugely weird and hugely watchable is impressive.",
    "There’s an unmistakable, scathing sense of outrage behind the whole endeavor, and it’s impossible not to admire McKay’s reckless willingness to do everything short of jumping through flaming hoops on a motorcycle while reading aloud from Keynes if that’s what it takes to get people to finally pay attention.",
    "It all comes down to men behaving badly and greed rules all, though at least you’ll laugh and seethe along the way.",
    "If a film can essentially succeed while also remaining essentially frustrating, here's a prime example.",
    "Few of the characters feel fully fleshed out. McKay's Big Short also lacks a certain nuance in its third act, when McKay's agenda becomes abundantly, ham-handedly clear. Still, it's hard not to be outraged by what is learned.",
    "McKay’s attempt to cover so much ground is admirable; and the outrage that courses throughout is deeply felt. But his busy execution...feels labored.",
    "McKay's frustration about the financial crisis is obvious, his instinct of how to engage viewers less so. Buyer beware.",
    "Upon leaving The Big Short, audiences are likely to feel less enlightened than bludgeoned with a blunt instrument, albeit one wrapped in layers of eye-catching silks and spangles: You may be too old to cry, but it hurts too much to laugh.",
    "Its fourth-wall-breaking wags a finger at the perceived facile nature of celebrity-driven mass culture even as it ultimately condescends to audiences.",
    "On their own, individual scenes are effective enough in semi-farcically portraying the ignorance, avoidance and/or downright denial by the practitioners of bad loans. Together, however, they are wearying in their repetitive nature.",
    "At the end of it all comes McKay’s big angry harrumph about the meaning of the crisis — a sign of failed, frustrated satire. If you can make your message clear through comedy, there’s no need to say, “Here’s my moral.” A funnyman can’t afford to get caught wagging his finger.",
    "McKay's bumptious movie awkwardly combines fourth-wall-breaking gimmickry and flaccid indignation with the goofball energy that defines his comedies."

Wall Street is complex to the typical person, I followed it but only just barely.  Seeing several of the storylines that lead into one of the largest economical collapses of America is both incredible and worrisome.  To see so many professionals injecting so much convolution into the properties market on the back-end really makes you wonder how we managed to go so long without having a collapse sooner.  But this all happened and, in cases where applicable, the cast breaks that \"fourth wall\" to explain what's going on and if something absurd on screen actually happened (in most cases the answer is \"yes this actually happened\", or \"we're lead to believe this happened\").  Every actor in this movie turns in a solid performance, but I have to give a lot of credit to Steve Carrel for shining brightest in The Big Short.  He delivers with an incredible amount of conviction, as if he were actually in charge of an investment firm that just discovered the bedrock of America's economy were about to collapse.  It's all brilliant stuff, and the fact that it's true, or mostly-true, might make your jaw drop a little bit.  If you're into the business/finance world, this will be even more enjoyable for you, since the terminology which is only explained in small summations will be received like this was all everyday English.  If you can truly say to yourself \"I have a hard time following complex movie plots\", this will be a bit of an exercise.  I highly recommend this movie, but there are going to be a small group of people that have it all go over their heads, and thus short this movie when it comes to their opinions/reviews.  The Big Short is one of the better films I've watched in the past year.",

There’re some great depth to the characters, but they never give any real excitement -- even though that there are some few, even smart, moments to them. Great acting and writing is a present aspect yes, and the vast ambitious story tries to simplify many definitions that’s too complex for the normal citizen to understand -- but mostly fail due to the lack of even more simplifications. This is a pure dialog-driven film, and it can be draggy. But it still does manage to bring many realistic facts to life, but ”the normal man isn’t knowledgeable enough” -- that’s the major flaw of this ’Parks and Recreation-ish’ direction flick.\r Personal rating: 65/100\rCritical rating: 72/100",

It takes chances using offbeat conventions that are nothing new but unexpected for this subject.  However it is horribly shot emulating a show like \"The Office\" and is fairly sloppily edited at least in the cutting sense.  There is no reason ever to have that phony cinema vérité video look for a theatrical motion picture.  It's an all too common dumb choice by filmmakers believing it makes it more real.  Hey I'll watch \"60 Minutes\" if I want real!\rThen again the director here has no sense of style, only a frat boy sense of humor.  It's funny at times yeah and yet tackles the complex content surprisingly efficiently, and that comes close to overriding the annoyances.  The Academy sheep didn't seem to mind them and nominated it best picture along with its slob director.  Ironic since it's that very sheep like mentality that the film is critical of.",

Anyway, I was able to understand something.Although I'm not sure that I understood it completely,only superficially.As I had understood, one peculiar genious forecasted economic crisis in the future and he decided to earn some money on it by investing for banks which later would pay him in case his conjectures about decline in real estate market would be confirmed.After this crazy idea whetted,another man working in the same area,decided to follow the lead,involving other individuals.Subsequently, all these economists with the great plan above failed because market was stable due to banks' cheating.The end of the story is unknown for me but I suspect that they achieved what they wanted.The movie is brilliant for its impeccable performances.Actors' transformations are unbelievable so as viewers can have feeling that these people are real economists and not actors at all.I can pretty imagine how difficult it was to learn screenplay.Margot Robbie cheered with her small cameo.Among leading stars,I fancied Christian Bale,Finn Wittrok and Brad Pitt in the movie.Ryan Gosling is always the same in all his works.I don't really know what is so special about this guy apart from his charm.I regard him as a quite average actor.To sum up,I would recommend \"The Big Short\" to spectators who have clues and interests in economy world.Also,the admirers of high-quality movies could add this piece to their bucket lists.",

He examines how the sub-prime mortgage crisis brought our country (and the world) to the brink of financial disaster and how a small group of smart investors managed to make big money on it.

The performances don't really stand out as much as the film's script and actual true-to-life content but Carrell turns in some surprising work and the cast is solid all across the board. The only thing I felt was missing was any nod at all to the big brokers/investors like Peter Schiff, Marc Faber, and Jim Rogers, who went on TV (some as early as 2006) accurately predicting the crisis, and also made serious bank off of it. I understand this is not their movie but would have appreciated even just a small acknowledgment that, yes, SOME very smart financial people saw this coming and were able to get on TV to warn us... only nobody listened because each network had talking heads to counter-point them (seriously, just look those dudes up on YouTube).

Adapted from Michael Lewis' book about 2008 global financial crisis, the screenplay from director Adam McKay co-writing with Charles Randolph does not broadcast the audiences directly to understand tonnes of financial theories, but to engage and enlighten through another creative way by mixing this dry lessons with parody and satire. Without a significant hero, the choice of the cast is definitely perfect - Bale, Carell, Gosling and Pitt perform extremely well, together with the supporting casts to play around with mortgage, subprime rates and credit debts. Despite illustrating this subject in a triumphant way, it has also successfully delivered self-awareness regarding desperation, political corruptions and collateral damages in economy slowdown; leaving an impression of skepticism on Wall Street while restoring some faith in Hollywood's capability in making great films.",

With an adaption of Mr. Lewis' book by Director Adam McKay and co-writer Charles Randolph, the film has an outstanding ensemble cast including Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell, Christian Bale and Brad Pitt (who was also one of the producers of the film). Mr. Bale’s character and 3 others find that the bundles of mortgages being sold by Wall Street firms to their investors are loaded with subprime (a/k/a) \"bad\") mortgages, most of which have adjustable sweetheart rates that end in or about 2007. Recognizing this and the debacle that will ultimately occur when mortgage rates and payments will suddenly soar and foreclosures will become the inevitable consequence,, these savvy mavericks swap or 'sell short' these bundles in order to reap the high profit that they anticipate will come about. The film is filled with trade acronyms and concepts that even well seasoned brokers would not understand so, in order to educate the viewing audience, stars like Selena Gomez, Anthony Bourdain and a lady in a bubble bath interject themselves into various frames in the film in order to explain to the viewer the complexities of these arrangements.\rThe vehicle works and what might otherwise have been a disaster of technical jargon becomes a more or less easily understood combination of events, both serious and comedic,  that led to the crash of 2008. There is no single performance that stands out although the sum of all them makes this a film that should be seen by anyone who directly or indirectly was impacted by what occurred in the fatal year when Wall Street houses and stocks crumbled.

The result is a parable of daring existential savvy and “cojones” triumphing over institutionalized corruption and tunnel vision; the sort of thing Kierkegaard or Albert Camus would applaud in a nanosecond, and although not quite your by-the-numbers Robin Hood caper, then at least something sufficiently “Robin Hood-ish” to have something for everyone to take heart about (i.e., the previously mentioned Little-Hedge-Fund-That-Could angle).\r Incongruous as all of this may sound, the end result is an extraordinary cinematic and political delight from start to finish and is even (somehow?) perfect Christmas/Holiday Season fare. McKay’s innovative direction and his extraordinarily inspired cast keep things percolating at just the right, slightly off-kilter and wacky tempo. Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Brad Pitt (one of the film’s producers) and Ryan Gosling are all clearly on board with McKay’s Smartest-Guys-in-the-Room interpretation of events that what ultimately comes across is a sort of Lord-of-the-Rings-Comes-to-Wall-St. epic that is the movie equivalent of a real page-turner ! It would be a serious mistake to dismiss “The Big Short” as some kind of “feel good” exercise about small time hedge fund types taking big risks and hitting the jack pot because this very unusual film is far more than a quirky comedy or satire.  When the dust finally settles what we have here is actually passionate, scathing and somehow monumental indictment not only of Wall St. but (even more courageous to state and more worrisome to consider) the outrageous complicity of elected  officials who chose to do the bidding of their “Too-Big-To-Fail” banking overseers…..“Wall St. got bailed out, Main Street got sold out !” as the popular chant goes. The SEC/Security  Exchange Commission, as well as the credit rating agencies  Standard and Poors and Moody’s (see photo below) come in for more than a few well-deserved, well-aimed body blows.\r “ Big Short” is an important film about what is arguably THE major struggle of our times: (a dismantled, downsized nominal democracy versus an insatiable and rapacious oligarchy). It also happens to be a work so strangely compelling that you will probably end up committing large chunks of it to memory after 2 or 3 viewings due to the fact that it regales us with such an audacious handling of its material - real gusto, passion and a sense of outrage rarely seen these days. What the viewer experiences is not unlike watching someone making their way  over Niagara Falls on a tightrope: you hold your breath, wrestle with the impulse to cover your eyes and yet- through the whole ordeal-  welcome every moment with real gratitude (psychologist Abraham Maslow’s idea that our perception of Truth helps to keep us sane and healthy probably kicks in here somewhere.)\r This is also one of the most cinematically and politically FEARLESS films you’ll ever see; every gamble the script makes (and there are many) and every wildly intuitive hunch the direction takes (and there many) pays off totally…. nothing is overstated, no shot is held for even a nanosecond too long…our interest never flags….You would have to go back to Robert Altman on a very good day I.e., “Nashville”..….or Godard or Truffaut or Woody Allen on a good day to find a film this innovative.\rWhat we end up watching in “The Big Short” is a story that is stranger than fiction and yet one that unfolds, is tried-and-true fairy tale tradition, with a cast of spellbound couriers, mysterious ancestral curses and wise old and not-so-old sages….in short the world that History itself appears to have been keeping in store for us now uber-challenged 21st century residents of planet Earth. All of this Adam McKay has chosen to direct with a gusto and panache that borders on audacity. Fortunately a kind of grace seems to hover over his every directorial decision and the result is dazzling and at times mesmerizing. We end up cheering for these underdog hedge fund managers who have thrown caution to the winds and risked everything on the use of their wits....as well as for a gifted American film maker and artist named Adam McKay who can so clearly empathize with them.",

Watching the financial collapse happen almost all over again is a gut wrenching experience that The Big Short turned into the best time I had in the theater all year. Honestly, The Big Short may be the most entertaining and informative films I have watched in a film. Unique in its storytelling, entirely subversive, and odd/quirky, The Big Short is a great time and does a great job explaining its, at times, complex story. At no point do you feel lost or confused by its complex terminology, because it always bring it to the point where you can understand exactly what is happening. Even more, it is hysterically funny at times. Truly, it skewers its villains and twirls the knife with glee, though it does certainly leave its protagonists seeming more than a little morally and ethically ambiguous. Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell are absolutely phenomenal here. Christian Bale and Brad Pitt are also very, very good in their roles. Director Adam McKay manages to exceed all expectations with his directorial ability here and, honestly, I am not sure who else could have pulled it off with such a complex and unique way of telling this tale. The Big Short is not the best film of the year, but is certainly a contender for funnest film of the year.",

It helps that the screenplay is sporadically funny even if impetus is lost by the end due to over length. The ability of the average viewer, however, to decipher all the plot points and jargon relating to the financial industry is almost guaranteed to restrict its audience.  Of the actors, Steve Carell comes of best and totally redeems himself after his dreadful turn in ‘Freeheld’.

It also managed to remain consistently funny and fresh (for the most part.) It's worth noting that I loved the first half of this film, as it was quick-witted and gave great insight through various forms, such as interesting facts, famous celebs explaining certain things, etc. However, I was somewhat dismayed to find that the second half, much like the film's subject matter, began to go slightly downhill to the point where it almost felt like a separate film (and not exactly in a good way.) By this time, the film had already made its point, yet it began to drag on for slightly longer than I would've liked. Aside from that, the performances were all rather enjoyable from a great cast. Christian Bale, Steve Carell, and Ryan Gosling all gave great, scene-stealing performances. Brad Pitt, however, certainly deserved more screentime in my opinion. Overall, despite what I considered to be a shaky second half, I'm willing to mostly forgive that due to the blast I had with the first half as well as the great performances from the ensemble cast. And besides, I will admit that Adam McKay did make a pretty good departure from his usual raunchy comedy films like Anchorman, Step Brothers, etc.",

The result is one of the best movies of 2015.  (Sicario is still my top movie pick 2015 despite the Oscar snub.)\r That being said, I do have an Ax to grind.  It seems like every movie I see has an opening screen shot that says, “Based on a true story”, which is a meaningless statement, and is not the same as, “The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.”   I mention this only because I see a whole lot of my fellow Metacritics blathering on about “Wall Street greed” as if they now have total understanding as to the cause the 2008-2009 Housing Crisis and Stock Market collapse.”\r For those whose only source of information is this movie, I would respectfully point out that the movie fails to even mention the contributory (and possibly causal) role played by US government policies which, to put it kindly, ‘encouraged’ these lax lending standards, and the two GSEs (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), which were then, and are still today, the principal buyers of Mortgage Backed Securities, when such MBS are up made up of FHA insured loans.\r The GSE’s didn’t buy these MBS because they were duped by Wall Street.  They bought them because Federal government policies required them to do so.  There’s a wise old Wall Street saying which says: Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.  Too bad there isn’t a wise old saying about the unintended consequence of do-gooder politicians.  (Barney?  George? Are your ears burning?)",

While the film is not perfect it is very funny, probably because the director is comedy specialist Adam McKay, and is also a somewhat important film because it’s very revealing. The Big Short is interesting and educational, features a great ensemble, but is subject to some distracting camerawork. For anybody interested in the 2008 Housing Market Crash this film is perfect.\rThe film begins with narration that addresses the biggest problem the film will have, which is that the Housing Market Crash of 2008 was an extremely complicated issue, that is why so few saw it coming. The story is so complicated, because it requires some understanding of how the housing system worked at the time, which apparently most of the people running the system at the time didn’t even have, so the film ends up teaching the audience how the crash happened. That sounds boring, but the film does a brilliant job by doing it through hilarious cameos and lacing the overly informational pieces with humor. The film accomplishes the very hard task of making the mess understandable, and even teaching those interested enough about how it went wrong.\rWhen looking at it The Big Short clearly had a great script, with dialogue that just rolls, but in such a complicated movie the acting had to be good. Christian Bale is very good as the wacky Dr. Michael Burry, often embodying the odd personality he was tasked with, and even handling the task of showing a misunderstood genius. The other performer who was terrific was Steve Carell, who has consistently proved that he’s not just a great comedy actor. While Carell is known for films like The 40 Year Old Virgin, last years Foxcatcher and now The Big Short prove that he can give a performance with emotional depth, and a sense of humanity.\rThe only thing that the film really doesn’t well is it’s camerawork, which in such a complicated story seems too distracting. The Filmmakers felt they needed to rely on Close-Ups, rack focuses, and shaky movement. To be clear the film only feels so shaky, because much of the film is shot handheld, and in close-ups, which will accentuate movement. It’s easy with a lot of soft focus, which this film plays with a lot, to be pulled out of the film, and thus it requires even more effort from the audience to follow what’s happening. To make an example it’s like if somebody pointed at something in a dark cave at night, and then pointed a flashlight in your face, as you looked for it.\rIn the end, The Big Short is a funny, intelligent, well-acted, and interesting view of the few men able to make money when everybody else was losing money hand over fist. The entire ensemble of talented big name actors carry their own weight, and some even rise above expectations. To be honest everybody should watch this film, because it tells the ever important story of how ignorance caused a worldwide meltdown, and we’re apt to do it again if we don’t learn from our mistakes.",

While at times jumbled, the movie still made me question whose side I was on. That of the ridiculously greedy bankers, hoodwinking the American people? Or those \"outsiders\" that wanted this corruption to end? But only because they would become filthy rich.)\r Truly a moral dilemma, one that I would never want to be a part of. This utter greed and disregard was revolting and that's how it was displayed. Lavish trips to Las Vegas, not bothering to check the CDOs... And it's still happening, 8 years and many hardships later. But on the side of the film, not the topic, The Big Short gave interesting perspective. I don't think the movie could have survived without the explanations that doubled as comedic relief, yet they were placed just so the audience was not completely lost.\r Star-studded as it may be, The Big Short doesn't follow big money. Going against the grain with no truly likable characters is never easy, and they nearly pulled it off.

But like Moore’s work, the film is sometimes preachy in an overbearing way, and like Moore himself, writer/director Adam McKay doesn’t trust the audience with serious material: the film assumes that the audience must always be entertained. I don’t think I’m spoiling anything of substance when I mention that the film literally takes breaks from the story in order to have celebrity guests like Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez, and Anthony Bourdain explain complex financial instruments directly to the camera. The scenes are presented in a way that’s meant to come across as fun and irreverent. As somebody who followed the financial crisis as it unfolded, and read about it afterwards, I found the whole tack to be vaguely insulting. Still, McKay probably recognized that he had a fascinating and important story, and realized that he needed a way to convey this information to members of the audience without boring or confusing them; he can’t be faulted for operating from accurate assumptions.\r The film follows the interesting characters who took the daring position of ‘betting’ against the housing market in the mid-2000s (through short selling). It should be noted that these weren’t the first people to notice the housing bubble -- just the ones who profited from it. (Dean Baker, who also accurately predicted the tech bubble burst, wrote about this as early as 2002; see ‘The Run-Up in Home Prices: Is it Real or Is it Another Bubble?,’ Aug 2002.) Pointing this out doesn’t make their stories any less engrossing. I found Christian Bale’s performance in the role of Michael Burry particularly noteworthy; Carrel and Gosling are also terrific.\r “The Big Short” is not the best of the year, and I don’t think it deserves the Oscar nomination it will surely receive. But it’s good. And it is fundamentally accurate in its depiction of the financial industry as driven by fraud and fueled by greedy incompetence.",

The financial content of the movie was fairly complex, which is the way it's meant to be.  That is, the financial instruments used by \"Wall Street\" leading up to the crisis were sufficiently complex that hardly anyone could understand how they worked. And thus hardly anyone could foresee their eventual collapse.  If you believe the story as told by this movie, you place almost all the blame on the Wall Street banks and financial ancillaries, for creating and trading these complex financial instruments in order to make a fortune, while the government regulators were essentially asleep at the switch.  Of course, that's far from an accurate picture. It was the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that told Fannie and Freddie to make loans to \"underserved\" borrowers, and in fact specified minimum quotas for the numbers of such borrowers. In order to comply, Fannie and Freddie substantially reduced their underwriting standards. Whereas before 1992, Fannie and Freddie required that mortgages require a 10 percent down payment, by 2000 they required no down payment.  So it was federal policy to encourage banks to make mortgage loans to borrowers who were poor credit risks. In fact, I would use the word \"force\" instead of encourage.

In what could be considered McKay's first real venture into serious filmmaking, The Big Short boasts fantastic performances from a rock-solid round-up of players, including Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale, and especially Brad Pitt, in a very reserved, moralistic and matured role - it's a shame he doesn't have more screen time. McKay manages to make boring subject matter interesting, satirical, mischievous and even thought-provoking, as our supposed 'heroes' are challenged to re-examine their values and their integrity. But where this film separates itself from others of its kind is its transparency. We are let in on some of the circumstantial inaccuracies, mostly through Gosling's very candid and cool narration. Characters frequently break the fourth wall, providing 'spark notes summaries' and creative metaphors to help decode and paraphrase all the economic jargon; a wonderfully fresh and focal method of exposition in order to maintain comprehension and interest.\r With relatively but deliberately unstable cinematography from Barry Ackroyd ('The Hurt Locker' [2008], 'Captain Philips' [2013]), it has a tremendous sense of edginess and enigmatic energy, propelled by the powerhouse performances of the ensemble cast; Carell in particular. With freeze frames, a fragmented narrative, and frantic editing style, it bounces from scene to scene as it fields cynical humour, dramatic weight, and socio-economic commentary in beautiful proportion. Director McKay expertly places the main characters in the position of the audience - they can do nothing but sit and watch what happens (or is about to happen) before them. Our supposed heroes may stand to become financially rich, but ultimately morally bankrupt as these select few stand victorious over thousands who lose houses, jobs, and their lives.  Viewers are challenged to consider \"Would I not do the same thing?' The interest in this story and these characters isn't in the where the story concludes, because it's known and predictable; the interest lies in the journey, as this mixed bag of stake holders navigate and wrestle with their own values in amidst the madness of the money market.\r An insightful and eye-opening investigation of accountability and moral responsibility, this powerful picture is easily the best effort of McKay's career to date.  It'll be a tough one to top; both in terms of his career and the upcoming Golden Globe Awards (and perhaps the Academy Awards).  A high recommendation, 'The Big Short' is one of the most important films of this century thus far.",

The rest (especially Steve Carrell) were hardly an afterthought. Christian Bale's performance was so overrated in this movie and it's not like it was grueling role he needed to prepare for psychically (compared to some of his previous great works).\r Also, none of the characters go though any significant changes - where they have some powerful life insight. The film is also anti-climatic - when the climax arrives, you hardly know it's there.\r There's no scene in this film that stands out in my mind where you''l be like \"wow that was memorable\" or \"wow that's a quotable line\"\r If you're a person who wants to see an entertaining film, this probably isn't the best choice.\rEvery time a film gets a ton of \"critical acclaim\" and there are people who are praising a film they haven't seen yet in order to look sophisticated among their friends - it's a huge red flag that the movie is boring as hell.",

The film is about the financial collapse in 2008 and those who made billions of dollarsFor many years I have said that my brother got the money gene and I got the good looking  gene and, once again, “The Big Short” may prove that true.  The film is about the financial collapse in 2008 and those who made billions of dollars while an unaccountable number of people lost their homes and/or jobs. Much is made of the fact that many behind the scene, knowing what was going on, didn’t do a thing to stop it and got away scot free.\r The film, with humor at odds with the theme, tries to explain exactly how the collapse came about in terms that even people like me might understand including the actors talking to the audience.  This latter gimmick is at first interesting, including Margot Robbie in a bubble bath drinking champagne and later Selena Gomez gambling in a Las Vegas casino explaining aspects of subprime mortgages, loans and other finances but it eventually becomes distracting when an actor breaks the fourth wall, making you tune out on what is being said.\r Though it is very much an ensemble film certain actors stand out such as Brad Pitt, almost unrecognizable until you realize who it is, playing a retired banker, Christian Bale as, to say the least, a very eccentric hedge fund manager, Ryan Gosling as an investor and Steve Carell as a rude trader.  Marisa Tomei and Melissa Leo, though good are more or less wasted.\r What interested me were the actors I didn’t know or did know but couldn’t name them. In the former group was Finn Wittrock as a young investor and Rafe Spall, both very impressive, and in the latter Jeremy Strong, Hamish Linklater and Adepero Oduye.\r Though the writers Charles Randolph and Adam McKay wrote the screen play, based on the book by Michael Lewis, using humor just doesn’t sit right with a subject we know does not have happy ending and brought the USA on the verge of collapse, affected the rest of the world and still does. The direction by McKay is hectic; the editing by Hank Corwin is confusing and the music, at times, jars the audience out of the movie.\r Money gene or not, understanding finance or not, I found the actors more interesting than I did the movie. “The Big Short”, by its subject alone, should have been more effective even though you will shake your head as the screen shows what didn’t happen to the ones who caused the collapse.",

It was almost documentarian how this was shot, keeping it swimmingly entertaining whilst gradually increasing dramatic potential until the final fall.
