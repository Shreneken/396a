  "title": "Kingsman: The Secret Service",
  "rating": 8.0,
  "release_date": "2015-02-13",
  "summary": "A veteran spy (Colin Firth) of a super-secret organization recruits an unrefined but promising street kid (Taron Egerton) into the agency’s ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "This is a case of all the elements lining up and pushing a potentially good film into the great category because of just how well executed it is.",
    "Vaughn and his collaborators have taken a crude and disposable property and turned it into something more – a thoughtful, exciting, whip-smart spy adventure that doesn't let its smart-ass post-modernism overwhelm its playfulness or its heart.",
    "Kingsman: The Secret Service is a spy movie made by James Bond devotees who know the genre so well that they can have a good time with it while also paying it respect -- and taking it to someplace new entirely.",
    "Those more devoted to the genre can debate whether Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman is the best comic-book movie of the last few years. What's beyond argument, however, is that Vaughn has whipped up the most interesting one, the only to make ferocious, unsettling art out of the great contradiction of superheroic fantasy: jolly do-goodism and its brutalizing sadism.",
    "Firth is brilliant. He’s playing a veteran super spy in a very violent but very silly movie, but even when Harry is explaining why there’s a dead stuffed dog in his bathroom, Firth gives a disciplined, serious performance.",
    "A brazen, subversive send-up of 007, Kingsman: The Secret Service also has the high-octane excitement to work as a spy film on its own merits.",
    "Things go from far-fetched to insane before it's over, and Vaughn wisely keeps the pace at a healthy clip. But never underestimate his power to floor you.",
    "Firth might appear like an odd choice for an action hero, but he makes a surprisingly convincing one in the Roger Moore mold, the sort of unflappable British gentlemen who can kick your ass without wrinkling his suit. He’s a great straight man for Jackson and some of the movie’s sillier elements as well; Firth has this unshakeable dignity and poise that even the most vulgar moments in Kingsman can’t puncture.",
    "Kingsman: The Secret Service is so well served in terms of gags, action and style that it bodes well for another savvy spy franchise and even more so for the star potential of Taron Egerton.",
    "Injecting fun and fairground thrills back into the spy movie, Kingsman is a blast. Firth is sensational, Jackson rules and newcomer Egerton surprises. Mission accomplished for Matthew Vaughn.",
    "Despite the presence of grandfatherly Michael Caine, Kingsman’s tone is about as far from the Christopher Nolan-style superhero film as you can get. Verisimilitude is frequently traded in for a rich laugh. The action scenes delight with shock humour.",
    "Kingsman: The Secret Service is a startlingly enjoyable and well-made action film leavened by humor and slicked along by style, made by, for, and about people who’ve seen far too many Bond films.",
    "Perhaps the riskiest mainstream movie in years, Vaughn’s love letter to spy movies may be uneven in places, but it’s ultra-violent, envelope-pushing, and fun enough to overcome the flaws.",
    "Kingsman: The Secret Service may lack the sophistication of its peers, but damned if it doesn’t know how to have a good time.",
    "At heart, “Kingsman” is a comedy, though granted, one with abundant dismemberments and literally mind-blowing violence. And I mean “literally” in the very strictest sense of the term.",
    "Kingsman is as violently kinetic as anything Vaughn has made, a list including Kick-Ass (the good one) and Craig's U.S. breakthrough, Layer Cake. But Kingsman is also wildly uneven, often slowing its roll to stiff-upper-lip pacing necessary (or not) to create a new British secret agent movie mythology.",
    "Fast-paced with a morbid sense of humor and copious pop culture references, Kingsman breezes along at a nice clip until it gets a little bogged down during its final third.",
    "A lively, dashing and amusing motion picture that smartly spoofs and slyly celebrates the James Bond spy-film franchise.",
    "It’s also a movie that further establishes Vaughn as one of the edgier and more underrated genre voices of the moment, and that makes us wonder why Colin Firth hasn’t indulged in an action sideline all along.",
    "Kingsman delivers on its promise of escapist fun, with a touch that alternates between Galahad’s old-school polish and Eggsy’s roguish charm. Like the rookie who knows that you have to make a few mistakes while following the master, the movie shrugs off its missteps with a wink and a smile that makes them easy to forgive.",
    "Mashing up satire, subtle social commentary, clever gadgetry, keen wit and high-octane style, this spy saga — based on the comic book series The Secret Service — is bolstered by a terrific cast.",
    "OK, got it. It's a spy movie spoof, \"Austin Powers\" with more violence and less camp, a Bond parody that zeroes in on the Roger Moore era, when the sets and gadgets got bigger and the stories got dumber.",
    "Kingsman is all over the place, sometimes to its detriment. But you won’t want to miss the surprises it delights in springing.",
    "Speaking of young men, newcomer Taron Egerton, playing Harry’s protégé, delivers a star-making performance flush with the kind of charm and unexpected gravitas that no amount of flashy filmmaking can fake.",
    "It's a lot of fun. But there's also something very bizarre about Kingsman. Namely, its politics are incredibly strange, wildly vacillating between a kind of egalitarian progressivism and the equivalent of shrugging wildly and saying, \"Who cares! The status quo is fine!\"",
    "Kingsman is full of elaborately orchestrated violence and acrobatic stunt work, shot in fast, sinewy, CGI-enhanced long takes that push and pull our perspective this way and that. It’s all very silly and not really meant to be taken seriously, but as the story gets more and more brutal, something strange happens: We start to care for these cartoonish characters and this absurd scenario.",
    "Directed by \"Kick-Ass\" action specialist Matthew Vaughn with slightly more vigor than necessary and a shade less restraint than needed, it's a bit too too to be \"brilliant,\" as the Brits say. But it's not half bad either.",
    "Director Matthew Vaughn strikes an energetic balance between cartoonish action and character-driven drama... The mix grows less seamless and the story loses oomph as it barrels toward its doomsday countdown, but the cast’s dash and humor never flag.",
    "While seriousness has overtaken the Bond franchise in recent years (hardly a bad thing, mind you), Kingsman runs no such risk. Vaughn welcomes details that might seem silly in another director’s hands, such as a bulletproof umbrella or tiny microchips that can make one’s head explode, presenting everything playfully enough that plausibility isn’t a factor.",
    "Camping it up, Jackson is hilarious.",
    "A live-action Hammacher Schlemmer catalog of pseudo-retro novelties, spiced up with self-aware asides and over-the-top violence — slick entertainment, provided the viewer turns off whatever part of their brain is responsible for recognizing and parsing subtext.",
    "The film never entirely figures out what it wants to do with the myth of the superspy, but at least it has fun along the way.",
    "Never less than slick, precision-tooled multiplex entertainment, Kingsman hews close to the formula Vaughn and his co-writer Jane Goldman established in their superficially similar \"Kick-Ass\": hyperspeed action, pithy one-liners and grotesque ultraviolence.",
    "Kingsman: The Secret Service is a modestly entertaining romp that will probably delight those who like to see a genre turned upside down so all its lunch-money lands on the ground, and purveyors of kinetic and no-holds barred gore will also get a treat.",
    "Director Matthew Vaughn’s latest film, Kingsman: The Secret Service, is an attempt at finding a balance somewhere between Austin Powers and James Bond that doesn’t quite succeed.",
    "On many levels, Kingsman has the makings of a sure-fire hit. Yet, this is one spy story even the most dedicated addicts of the genre would do well to miss.",
    "It sounds fun in theory, I guess, and there are some entertaining moments of rude irreverence here and there but the giddiness gets a bit tedious after a while.",
    "Mr. Firth gives his all, and then some. He’s very funny, even touching, when the material allows him to be. Yet the production, directed by Matthew Vaughn (“Kick-Ass,” “X-Men: First Class”) from a screenplay he wrote with Jane Goldman, can’t contain its centrifugal force.",
    "It tries to get by on charm, and like a lot of movies, and people who make that attempt, “Kingsman” does have charm — just not enough.",
    "As February comic book movies go, this works well enough to make you glad they didn’t cook up another “Ghost Rider.”",
    "This is pitiful stuff, and, like the violence, it eats away at the blitheness for which Kingsman strives, leaving an aftertaste of desperation that the Connery of “Goldfinger,” say, would not have dreamed of bequeathing. The sadness is that Firth, alone in the film, does raise the spectre of those days, radiating a lightly amused reserve amid the havoc.",
    "The problem is that Mr. Vaughn has no interest in, or perhaps understanding of, violence as a cinematic tool. He doesn’t use violence; he squanders it.",
    "Half amusing and half appalling, Matthew Vaughn’s shameless spy caper Kingsman: The Secret Service is ultimately done in by its own hypocrisy.",
    "Yet for all Vaughn’s attention to stylized details, I noticed a number of obvious continuity errors throughout to which Vaughn seems blind.",
    "Kingsman is like a high-speed collision between a Jaguar and a jaywalking soccer hooligan. It’s ridiculously out of balance, and when you’re stuck in the middle, it doesn’t seem so funny.",
    "Silly, sadistic and finally a little galling, Kingsman: The Secret Service answers the question: What would Colin Firth have been like if he'd played James Bond?",
    "Kingsman: The Secret Service borrows the tone, story, characters and humor of “Kick-Ass,” only this time in a 007 world instead of Batman’s. Nearly everything it does, it does poorly: This one is “Weak-Ass.”",
    "Expensive, derivative and boring as mattress ticking masquerading as designer fabric.",
    "It's tructured in familiar, safe terms, plays for very low stakes, and appeals to no one so much as white, male teenagers with chips on their shoulders.",
    "The more calculated Vaughn’s films are to appeal to his surprisingly rabid fan-base, the more they seem custom-built to repel everyone else."

The fast edited fight scenes go on way too long, it's really violent, and the film can't really decide if it's an all out comedy or drama. At times it has \"Airplane\" type of humor, like it's making fun of the spy genre, and other times heavy on the drama. At one point they even poke fun of product placement in movies with McDonalds, again showing the \"Airplane\" style of satirical humor.  Somehow it all worked for me mainly due to the spirited acting by everyone involved. Not really a film I would desire to see again but fun for an afternoon.",

Stay away from having that 007/hardcore secret agent mindset and loosen up because there's plenty of comedy peppered in. I first want to say that Colin Firth was a good choice and I expect alot of good work from him. Also, it almost seems like a gimmick that Samuel Jackson was portrayed but he DID NOT disappoint guys.  I didn't really pay attention to the music this time but like I mentioned earlier don't expect the trademark 007 stuff.\r Let's talk about the comedy real quick. I didn't laugh much at all and the movie really laid out a lot of forced humor. So them trying to impress me and sway me from focusing on the movie and its holes....Nooooo sir, I got my eye on you sneaky screenwriters.\r The action and choreography was solid, and I do think it could've been a lot better as it relied on technology alot to wow the audience. One thing I liked is the historical context and detail to current events and this movie did that so I appreciate that. I would like to write more about certain holes iin this movie maybe in the plot or the character development but I want people that have not watched this to read this first.\r You're going to have a good time watching this and I recommend watching it with a friend.

An over the top action film that will have you gasping and laughing in equal measure. Vaughn's masterstroke is casting Colin Firth as the hero spy and having him kick ass in a way that we have never seen before. There are amazing stand out sequences (the church, the pub, the Land Of Hope And Glory finale) but what makes the film work are the little touches and the clever references to spy films of the past.

Quantity wise Vaughn's films might not be much - even though directing five movies in 10 years is impressive in my book - but the quality of his films speak for themselves.\rKingsman: The Secret Service is no exception to the rule, it's thrilling, fun, and has that Matthew Vaughn touch written all over it. He made a movie using extremes and opposites. It's classy with a bit of filth in it, funny but also serious, a real treat. It's a well made, nicely paced adrenaline rush of an action film that has a James bond movies flair. They modernized the spy genre and mixed with a drop of comedy. The action scenes are amazing, beautiful to watch well choreographed and fun. As violent as it may be, Kingsman wasn't gruesome or tiresome despite the massive body count.\rThe actors did a great job, Colin Firth as an action star is badass and awesome, Mark Strong is surprising, Jackson is an interesting villain, and Taron Egerton is smooth in this role. But I am commanding Matthew Vaughn for his work, because this somewhat cliché plot feel original, it's done in such a unique way. Matthew Vaughn - and his team - took everything we've seen, again and again, but added a twist. So every time there was a cliché, something we expected, there was a little twist and that made it not quite what was anticipated. It kept us on our toes and made the movie a good roller coaster ride.\rFun fact, one of Colin Firth's aliases in the movie is DeVere Vaughn's real name.\r @wornoutspines",

But when the unexpected violent Tarantino church scene happens, the movie takes a sudden lurch into a completely different area altogether.  It tries to regain its light and fast paced momentum when the good guys decide a genocide of their own is the only option.  Suddenly we are in an Austin Powers movie with heads exploding into colorful fireworks and pretty clouds and musical anthems playing in the background.  The movie did not seem to know what genre it was in or how sensitive to be to death and gore.  This non commitment to a theme left the movie feeling somewhat schizophrenic.\rThe saving grace of the Kingsmen were its actors.  Firth is always on point and delivers an outstanding character.  Jackson, however, was the real surprise here.  Stepping out of his box for this role and giving us a goofy guy we could love to hate.  Boutella's character was worthy of any Bond villain/ henchmen in the history of the genre.  She made the film exciting!\rThe story was decent, it just could have done without the violent mass murder church and Austin Powers genocide tangents.

The performance of the cast is perhaps one of the major factor that the film is extremely entertaining, it gathers four Kingsmen - Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson, in which each of them represent the characters that they are not used to be in other recent films, while it is also undeniable that young potential actor Taron Egerton sparks in his character as Eggsy too.

If he can pass their test, he will be one of the new initiated into their ranks - just a threat from a twisted tech genius threatens the world.\r Every since the first trailer for this movie came out I already known that this movie was going to be great because Matthew Vaughn directing it and that guy knows how to make a well made film that reminds everyone what good movies are, and that's why these no surprise that this movie was awesome.\r Kingsman: The Secret Service is a like tribute to good spy films that seem to be serious or not very well made these day, yeah they where cheesy and goof but that's what we remember best from them and this movie was the perfect tribute to that, and a perfect tribute that everybody isn't going to see because everybody is going to see 50 Shades of Rubbish, I just lose faith in humility after that.\r Matthew Vaughn to me is a director who knows how to direct good action scenes and knows how to entertain the audience, and with this movie he directed this with style and a enough effort to make a bad-ass film, even when his movies mostly flop at the box office it will have a cult following and Kingsman will have a cult following. Nice work Matthew Vaughn.\r Jack Davenport who is a new star and this is his first big role his every been in and my god was he great in this movie. This is my first time I ever seen this guy act and let me tell you this guy has a bright future a head for him.\r Now at the first I didn't really thought that Colin Firth kicking ass would work, but after seeing the movie I was wrong..dead wrong. Every time Colin Firth was in a action scenes I bought it because I heard in a article that he did all of his stunts and I got to say he pulled it of brilliantly. His character Harry Hart was the best character in the whole film and every time his on screen he stole the whole film for me.\r Samuel L. Jackson has the villain was just spot on brilliant, I mean talking about a villain that was fun and freaking hilarious. But at the first I wasn't very sure about the way he talked in the film, he talked like Adam Snadler from WaterBoy, but after a while I got use to it and it worked for his character. These days I feel that Samuel L. Jackson is just filling it in with his new movies, but in this I actually sawed him playing and caring about his character and he knocked it out of the park.\r This movie probably has one of the best action scene I've seen since...I'm not kidding you here but The Matrix, and that's the Church scene. May god way do I even begin with this, the scene itself was fast paste but I still could see what was going on and that action scene was shot beautifully well and it showed what action should be filmed. So watch when you see the film look out for the Church scene it will not disappoint.\r Now for problems and I only have some: I got to say that the first couple of minutes of the movie I didn't really get sucked in into the movie that much, but as the movie went along I finally got into it.\r Overall Kingsman is a movie that deserves more attraction, skip 50 Shade of Whatever and see this movie, trust me this movie is more well made than 50 shades.",

Matthew Vaughn did a great job in keeping with the theme: Chessy villain with an over-the-top doomsday plot, a secret spy organization with ultra cool gadgets, and a wonderful cast of characters that brings it all together. While some of the stuff feels shoehorned in at times, they did a great job at presenting everything very well. Colin Firth does a great job in this movie, something I'm not accustomed to seeing him in, and his fight scene in the church later on in the movie is wonderfully done and the best part of the movie in my opinion.\rThe main issue I have, and it's honestly not a very big issue, is the ending and the outcome of the ending. It's clear that they will probably make a few of these movies and the ending from this one really asks more questions than it answers. Yes, the main character (who is much more likable than I was expecting), saves the world but at what cost? I'm very interested in seeing how they deal with some of the consequences of the first movie here.\rThat said, this is easily the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long time and I heartily recommend anyone who's even remotely a fan of the genre to watch this movie. It's just a fun movie meant to keep you having fun and it accomplishes it tremendously. Here's hoping for a few more sequels in the future.",

Since 2005, thanks to the likes of Martin Campbell and Christopher Nolan, two directors that took two very different iconic action figures, Batman and James Bond, and injected a much needed, gritty, dark, reality-based foundation to these characters and their overall narratives, over-the-top action has long been expired. In the last decade, what has arisen, is a very dark and realistically twisted take on many action icons, both in the superhero genre and the action hero genre, that allows the cartoonish elements of these characters to fade, and the realistic to rise in popular and rewarding box office results.\r One of these aforementioned films that inhabited a reality based narrative structure was the recently re-invisioned X-Men film franchise, which was, ironically, reinvented by Matthew Vaughn in X-Men: First Class in 2011. The film, which took place in 1962, set around the events of the Cuban Missile Crisis, showed just how much the comic book genre succeeded among audiences when introduced around real-world events.\r The amazing thing about Kingsman: The Secret Service, is that the same man who was responsible for breathing new, raw life into the X-Men franchise, after the disaster that Brett Ratnet’s X-Men: The Last Stand was, is the same man that is bringing back the absolutely manic and outrageous spy-agent genre with a vengeance. Thankfully for everyone, Kingsman: The Secret Service is the action movie we have been waiting to see and the is the tremendously alternative to a highly unbelievable 007 movie that never came.\r Upon first view, I too was skeptical about the dynamics of Vaughn’s newest Millar adaptation (Vaughn had already adapted Millar’s Kick-Ass). Looking back at the trailers, the action looked silly; the players too cliched in the world of agent-spy standards; and gimmicky thanks to the inclusion of adorable pugs and attractive cast members. Boy was I wrong!\r Kingsman is a highly calculated film romp that never takes itself too seriously, yet never lets go of its grip of highly entertaining action movie and escapism Hollywood fluff. To think that Vaughn could have potentially abandoned this project completely to make X-Men: Days of Future Past is sad. Thankfully, the highly visionary and confident filmmaker stuck to his guns, and delivers easily, one of the most entertaining films of 2015 thus far.\r Kingsman begins as any action movie should; with a girl. But this girl, is a recently widowed mother who surprisingly has a stranger visit her in the late night, to tell her that her husband, a Kingsman (unbestknown to her) was killed in the line of duty. The stranger, Harry Hart (Colin Firth), is unwelcome in the home, and focuses his energy to his partners newborn son, Eggsy (newcomer Taron Egerton), where he discloses to him that, if ever in the future he encounters any problems, the Kingsman are indebted to them forever thanks to the bravery of their patriarch.\r Flash forward a decade, and Eggsy is a troublesome youth, whose failed attempts in the marines, and trouble with the law finds his luck at the **** end, time and time again. It isn’t until Eggsy, who in an act of defiance for his mother against her petty mafia boyfriend, finds himself in a police station, in deperate need of the Kingsmans help. After a quick phone call, that ends ambiguously, Eggsy is released of the police station and greeted by the same man who visited him and his mother upon the news of his father’s death, Harry Hart. Luckily for Eggsy, Harry offers him a job interview, that could see him in the same line of work as his father, and could change his world forever thanks to an unexpected visit to a tailor shoppe.\r On the surface, Kingsman seems to be a neat and well dressed action film. Once cracked open, Kingsman is a rough, tough, cocky-filled fuel ride of adrenaline, bad manners and tailored attitude that puts James Bond and company to shame.",

Yeah, it was vanilla. It was plain, but people buy plain. Vanilla sells. Colin Firth uses his suave and cool to his advantage. Mark Strong barely does anything and still manages to be one of the best parts of the movie. I don’t remember seeing Taron Egerton before this movie, but he’s cool.  Samuel L. Jackson’s character had a unique and believable evil plot, and he had a believable motive.\r I don’t mind F-bombs in movies. An F-bomb is a great tool in the hands of a writer, and can be used to convey an extreme emotion, as it is an extreme word. That is exactly why I don’t like it in this movie. They lost their meaning and became stupid sentence filler. If you replaced every F-bomb with “shucks”, the movie would be hilarious.\r The violence was completely unnecessary. I’m fine with killing in movies. Bad guys can kill a huge amount of innocent people, it makes you hate them and root for the good guy. The good guy can kill an inordinate amount of bad guys. They got what was coming to them, and the innocent people they killed are finally avenged. The grotesque violence didn’t serve its purpose. You would never try to get Hitler over as a bad guy by showing the Holocaust with “born to be wild” in the background. But the scene in the church did just that. Something awful was happening, and they played rock music, because it was supposed to be “fun”.\r The movie markets itself as “fun”. I think a thesaurus is necessary for the marketing department, because “fun” is not a synonym for “stupid”. The gore-porn that happens in this movie doesn’t even serve a purpose, it’s there just to be there.\r And while I’m on the subject of the church scene, I know that nobody likes Westboro, but even the most demented, sick minded psychopath wouldn’t wish for what happened in the movie to happen to someone who just happened to disagree with them, even if their opinion was stupid and wrong.\r They try extremely hard, with the excess of F-bombs and over the top violence to tell you that this movie is not just another spy movie. Without the F-bombs and violence, it is just another spy movie. It’s a good spy movie, but it is vanilla. But they try to trick you in to thinking it’s not by taking you to cold stone and mixing in heath bars. Sorry, frozen heath bars get stuck in your teeth. You just ruined what could have been good ice cream. The movie itself tries to tell you it’s different, almost flat out.

For a film trying to be a satire of spy films, it was never funny and the jokes fell flat every time. Oh and lest we forget the stupid ending with the reference to anal sex. The joke fell flat and I am not a huge fan of nudity, unless it makes sense. Here, it was sexed up for the hell of it, which to me, is the sign of a bad movie that needs to have sex scenes to make things interesting. The only positive I can think of, other than the well shot action scenes, was the acting. In particular, Samuel L. Jackson was great. However, on the whole, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a horrific film that baffles me how people enjoyed it. Stupid, stupid, stupid.",

James Bond rip offs were mostThis film is the most ridiculous rip-off of James Bond, Superman, Matrix, X-Men, even Star Trek,  I've ever seen.  Anyone who thought this was entertaining has no clue about quality writing, screenplay.   James Bond rip offs were most atrocious and poorly done (got to dress properly, 'act' like James Bond, order your drink like bond (shaken, not stirred).   As in Bond films, we are drawn through the showcasing of all the neat gadgets the hero will eventually use to do in the bad guys.  The hero's persona was borrowed from the teen angst of the impulsive, smart, rawly talented likes of James T Kirk as late adolescent, the Superman-as-folksy-farm kid.  Oh., but we need to have him prove out----we'll have him compete with other teen-young adult peers and 'win' the competition (see X-Men); and we need to throw in a strong heroine  who has to depend on the hero for self-confidence and courage (make her good looking but never have her evidence any special talent or skill; but the main characters can't all be guys, right?).   One of the worst rip-off films in the last 10 year; entertaining perhaps, if you have little movie-going history under your belt.   Even the humor was ripped off ('.....you'll have to excuse me while I go save the world').   Emotional emphasis by all of the charactersswas totally reliant on using the f-word in every major scene (truly, this got to be dreadfully dull after the first hour.)    We have to throw in the political issue of global warming as the impetus for the bad guy (who as we know, has limit-less wealth to do any evil he wants).   I'd give the movie '1/2 of a 'star' ; and I wish to heck I could get my movie ticket money back on this one.\r You can skip this one if you have any historical memory of the Bond Series, Star Trek prequels, X-Men, Matrix.   Anyone of you who have seen the above movies, sequels etc., could have written this thing----REALLLY!!!    And, any single episode of these is 1000% better than this poorly written rip off.",
