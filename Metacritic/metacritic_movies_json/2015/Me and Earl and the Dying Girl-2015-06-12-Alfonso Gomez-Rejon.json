He even describes his constant companion Earl (RJ Cyler), with whom he makes short film parodies of classic movies, as more of a ‘co-worker’ than a best friend.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "A must-see — and one of the best films of the year.",
    "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl has those handkerchief moments, but the laughs far outnumber the hard and sad punches. This is a movie that’s grounded in reality, has just enough whimsy and soars to the stars. It’s one of the best films of 2015.",
    "It's a fresh, beautiful and heartbreaking achievement that continues to surprise until the very last scene. It's dangerous to call something an instant classic, but sometimes it's simply the truth.",
    "A smart-ass charmer, merciless tearjerker and sincere celebration of teenage creativity.",
    "Poignant without being melodramatic, overflowing with unforced charm, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl holds a unique appeal that's certain to last.",
    "The film remains sadly profound and profoundly sad, yet it holds just enough humor to lighten a weighty subject without trivializing it.",
    "Brimming with wit, crushing last-act melancholia, laughs, and poignant heart, Me And Earl And The Dying Girl is a spectacular delivery of tears, love and laughter, and a beautifully charming, captivating knock-out.",
    "It's a fine line between being gratingly self-conscious and really smart; more times than not, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl comes out on the winning side of that equation.",
    "This brilliantly funny, casually profound and deeply affecting coming-of-age chronicle, directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon from a screenplay by Jesse Andrews, even manages to be life-enlightening—it’s a fresh take on contemporary adolescence as a journey from ironic detachment to openhearted feeling.",
    "Blending wit and modesty, Mann fits the bill, coming across as an overgrown kid with a good heart, but virtually no practice in relating to others — which is perhaps the thing that makes his experience so profoundly relatable.",
    "Consistently hits the right notes, earning both the tears and smiles that result.",
    "Deftly juggling humor and heartache while always exuding a lovable quirkiness, the excellent art-house comedy/drama showcases three teenagers who pop off the screen with originality and, unlike a lot of the current coming-of-age ilk, just the right amount of unpredictability.",
    "A funny, hip, touching and utterly irresistible comedy-drama.",
    "This film geek's dream of a movie pulls the ground out from under you, but stays smartass to the end. Sweet.",
    "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl isn’t deep. But this sure-to-be-a-crowd-pleasing laugher/weeper reminds us that there’s nothing wrong with a romantic comedy that reaches for inspiring and cathartic between the laughs.",
    "Somewhere along the way Earl eases up on the suburban–Wes Anderson whimsy and starts to find its heart, infusing the story’s self-conscious cleverness and trick-shot set pieces with something sweeter, sadder, and even a little bit profound. In other words, it grows up.",
    "A winning movie about losing. I didn’t always warm to its coy quirkiness, but it’s the rare American movie about contemporary teenagers that rings more true than false.",
    "Gomez-Rejon’s sardonic yet sensitive story of geek friendship is the best YA illness novel adap yet. And yes, you can stick that on the poster.",
    "In their no-budget-goofball way, these minifilma are genius. Sheer genius. This kid, you figure, is gonna grow up to be quite a storyteller. And in a sense, he did.",
    "The charming, soulful Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a movie that loves movies — which is great, because you’ll love this one.",
    "High-school students have plenty of growing pains to offload, and Gomez-Rejon clearly knows what makes them tick. His film is at once buzzy, fun and confronting.",
    "What begins as a spirited but safely familiar pastiche of John Hughes and Wes Anderson is compelled to become its own thing, Gomez-Rejon’s film embracing the most tired tropes of stereotypical YA weepies so that it can kiss them goodbye.",
    "This film is sweet and frequently very funny. It isn’t perfect. Some of those imperfections – or, more to the point, irritants, such as the twee chapter headings and college-essay framing device – are carryovers from the YA novel, written by Jesse Andrews, who also adapted the novel to screen.",
    "This is among the funnier entries in the cancer-kid genre, flawed yet affable, with no fault in its dweebly charismatic stars.",
    "So this is a very worthy movie, not that this will hold any sway with illness-phobes, who’d rather stare at the wall for 105 minutes than see a good movie about sickness.",
    "The chief limitation of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is an old story: However touching, Cooke's Rachel is there mainly to prop up the sweetly messed-up young male lead, and then to quietly guide him toward adulthood.",
    "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl treats a serious subject with wackadoodle humor that is endearingly contagious. It’s tender, clever, wise and highly recommended.",
    "The film is touching and small, but also thoughtful and assured in a way that lingers after the inevitable tears have been shed and the obvious lessons learned.",
    "It’s so carefully designed to feel laid-back that its breeziness comes off like a calculation; its emotional pull is sometimes irresistible, which may make you want to resist it all the more. But the movie has flashes of wit and originality and feeling.",
    "Overly precious but undeniably affecting, Me And Earl And The Dying Girl travels into familiar dramatic terrain — the offbeat coming-of-age story, as well as the terminal-cancer drama — to deliver something that feels handmade and also heartfelt.",
    "Me and Earl is smart and appealing, but it spends way too much effort saying \"I'm not like that\" when it really is.",
    "Even Greg’s tattooed and charismatic history teacher (Jon Bernthal) is more interesting than the self-absorbed kid we’re supposed to care about.",
    "In other words, this movie isn’t just about an adolescent boy — it pretty much is an adolescent boy.",
    "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl succumbs to the same cloying too-cuteness and solipsism that often plague its glib and sentimental genre. But those limitations are leavened by the film’s lively, ultimately affecting flourishes and sprightly voice.",
    "A feature-length tribute to great directors with no direction of its own, his second feature is the kind of self-consciously quirky, slapdash movie that still leaves a viewer eager to find out what its director will do next.",
    "Appropriate to its teenage milieu, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon‘s breakthrough film isn’t unlike spending a couple of hours with an exceptionally witty high-schooler: It’s entertaining as hell, but you can’t help rolling your eyes a little at its self-satisfied pseudo-profundities.",
    "The climactic interaction between Rachel and the film that Greg has made for her is so ecstatically weird that it gets points for its audacity. It’s almost inspired. But the coda — an ode to Greg’s self-sacrifice — is unforgivable, a testament to the ego - and power-trip that is the movie’s ultimate reason for being.",
    "Other than that acquisitive movie-mad mindset, it is a pandering, self-flattering mess, featuring unearned catharsis, lazy clichés and characters presented in broad, sometimes-offensive stereotypes.",
    "It unites a mélange of teen-film tropes into a narrative overburdened with cultural references and framing devices, and undermined by a lack of attention to character.",
    "Gomez-Rejon has erected a gleaming shrine to adolescent narcissism."

      "content": "THIS IS THE PART THAT I BEGIN MY REVIEW AND INTRODUCE THE FILM WITH A CLEVER HOOK\r You would never think that a title with the words “dying girl” would be the most buzzed about film at Sundance 2015, causing a bidding war that wouldTHIS IS THE PART THAT I BEGIN MY REVIEW AND INTRODUCE THE FILM WITH A CLEVER HOOK\r You would never think that a title with the words “dying girl” would be the most buzzed about film at Sundance 2015, causing a bidding war that would eventually be won by Fox Searchlight Pictures for a whopping $12 million, the largest distribution purchase in the history of the fest. But alas, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a true testament to the power of YA pop culture, and a young adult film infused with the current obsession with cancer-driven teen fiction.\r Following in the footsteps of the widely popular The Fault in Our Stars and my personal favourite cancer-comedy 50/50, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a mix of both, with a hint of 500 Days of Summer in for good indie measure.\r Thankfully, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is miles ahead of the aforementioned Stars and is easily one of the most wryly self-aware and raucously comedic films of the year.\r The ironic aspect of Me and Earl is that cancer has never really been at the front-row of comedy in the real world. Although it is one of the most devastating diseases of our time, consuming the lives of many loved ones, cancer, in this instance, sets up one of the most endearing and authentic cinematic friendships seen on screen, in a very long time.\r Now if you are all thinking, how in the hell is a film about a very pending friendship between two boys and a girl recently diagnosed with leukaemia one of the funniest and best films of the year? All I’d have to say is “Respect the Research” and find out for yourself.\r THIS IS THE PART WHERE I EXPLAIN MY COMMENTARIES ON THE FILM\r One of the many (and I’m talking about a ton) charms of Me and Earl is its ability to share so many universal and relatable truths to its audience. The fact remains, Rachel Kushner (Olivia Cooke) is a seventeen-year old girl who is recently diagnosed with Leukaemia. Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann) is a smart-talking, quick responding, social leper who has serious issues with the word friendship and a great appreciation for hipster and event-garde culture (including Warhol, Herzog and B-films). Earl (RJ Cyler), the innocent by-stander in all of this, is your typical high-schooler who obsesses mostly with ****  Yet, these three unique characters and the serious and lighthearted issues they face in a small Pittsburg high school offer some of the most insightful and emotional responses from an audience in the year 2015.\r Based on Jesse Andrews’ book of the same name, the author was able to adapt his own book into a screenplay, keeping its infectious charm and wit intact. Luckily for us, Andrews’ book has been described as a book made to be read by anyone; anyone who has gone to high school, anyone who has lost someone they love, or grew up with a family, or has wondered what life is all about.\r Directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, a sophomore feature following his debut horror film The Town That Dreaded Sundown, the film blends a very inauspicious mix of quirk at first by beginning the story with an abundance of stop-motion animation, flashbacks, and some very obvious film-school favourites including; the long take; pans; and long shots. Rejon, who began his career as a personal assistant to Martin Scorsese, shows his range as a charming director who is able to not only amp up the quirk factor, but also get the best performances from his actors and characters to help narrate the story to uncontrollable moments of laughter. Much like its main character Greg (Thomas Mann) and his inability to obtain normal friendships or accept the obvious classes created in any high school setting, Rejon embraces the main essence of Andrews’ novel, loss and love and stays true to its unique nerdiness, owning every second of it.\r THIS IS THE PART WHERE I…TALK\r It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, and for the most part, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is easily one of the most satisfying films of 2015, and not for the usual ingredients that make an indie film so great either. While most indie films are applauded and hailed for their quirky soundtracks, incredible acting discoveries, and new finds, Me and Earl has an interesting quality of brining back the old, and making it cool again. Rejon, an obvious film enthusiast and lover of classics (Criterion quality to B-movie selections) sends great satisfaction of allowing his feature of reminiscing on these classic films in a fringe-type cinematic wet dream. His rehashing, mockery yet clear praise and reference to classic films shows his great admiration and love for film as a whole. While Greg and Earl half-heartedly remake some of their favourtite films, we get a clear sense of what makes them great friends, their ability to embrace their immaturity and playfulness. Rejon pulls it off through and through, that boys will be boys, while Mann and Cyler really hit that notion out of the par throughout each scene.",

We've seen some similar movies to this but this movie can find the balance and the right placement between the humor and the sad part of the story. This movie is equally well acted by the entire cast especially Thomas Mann who can play an awkward character realistically without me feeling awkward watching it.\rThis movie is also beautifully written by the author of the book which I think it's very important as he can tell very deeply about the main important character he created, Greg. I think it's interesting how He wrote Greg and Rachel as the realest characters in this movie and make others as these comical and not so serious supporting characters. I think it's important because this whole movie is supposed to tell how this dying girl can somehow change Greg's view in life. And we get to see all of that in a very deep personal way without getting distracted  by the supporting cast. I also love how this movie is wrapped up with such a clear and positive message.",

(Hey, I am looking forward to “Magic Mike XXL” next week, what can I tell you?)\r In the case of “Earl” and “Dope” I think there is definitely a very wide generation gap. The last time I saw my teens was 60 years ago and though I enjoyed “The Fault Is In Our Stars” last year it was more of a drama than teenage angst. There is some humor in “Earl” regarding the movies that Earl (RJ Cyler) and Geg (the ‘Me’-- Thomas Mann) make redoing classics, especially the titles they give their films. Olivia Cooke is certainly endearing as ‘the dying girl, Rachel, while Greg grows up over the course of the film and Earl is a wise young man before his time.\r Molly Shannon as Rachel’s single mother and Connie Britton as Greg’s mother, both overbearing parents, along with Nick Offerman as his beatnik father---by the way Earl doesn’t have any parents and lives with his older brother who threatens Greg with telling him his dog will bite off his face--and Jon Bernthal as a teacher and, more or less, a guidance counselor to the boys, are sort of annoying adults you will find in most pictures about teenagers though the latter less than the others.\r “Earl” is being sold as a comedy, a sort of John Hughes movie with lessons to be learned. Greg is constantly reminding the audience--there is a lot of voice over-- that Rachel doesn’t die and there are screen titles telling the passing of time and where we are at in the story. As a social misfit Thomas Mann carries the film and RJ Cyer is his effective sidekick and shows his many sides. Olivia Cooke is endearing as the dying girl who has leukemia and is very instrumental is helping Greg grow up.\r The direction by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon is all over the place, somewhat like the movies the boys make, while the screenplay by Jesse Andrews, who wrote the best selling novel, is low key without trying to tell the audience how to feel. The director of photography shows off Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, almost always in a glow of light, even in the night scenes.\r I laughed once and that was the boys film take-off of “Midnight Cowboy”  with the “Everybody’s Talking” theme song and, for a comedy, laughing once is not a good endorsement.\r I left the theatre wondering whatever happened to the girl who got stood up on prom night--maybe that’s the sequel?",

Earl is written as a stereotypical 'black guy' with no depth. Lots of inconsistencies in the film, such as being raised on foreign speciality foods, but insulting people eating foreign speciality foods, and Greg's personality in general.  In fact pretty much all the characters are unlikeable.  Rachel's the most likeable character, but of course she would be as a Manic Pixie Dream Girl.\r Anything that pays homage to classic films seems to be massively overhyped by critics, and any drama about cancer seems to get massively overhyped too in the same way Be Kind Rewind (2008) was overhyped 7 years ago and 50/50 was overhyped 4 years ago. So this film, focusing on both, seems to be getting far more attention than I believe it deserves.  Honestly I don't see this being any better than 2002's A Night To Remember.\r That being said the short films (or at least what we as an audience get to see of them) are pretty cool, and honestly I'd have preferred if that took more of a centrepiece of the movie for the first half, and the characters developed more fluidly, as the actual script and characters is bland.",

All this drowns in Ryan Murphyistic stylization- who knows how to balance it with crazy plot and even crazier characters. Casting also hits and misses - Earl and Me good- but the dying girl has been doing a nice job for the past two seasons dying on the TV series Bates Motel while being the object of an outcast teen’s fixation. Sound familiar? And when the moment we’ve been waiting for finally comes- the impact is quickly dissipated - by more voice over from here and beyond. It is the best of films.

Thomas Mann plays a high school senior, pressured by his mother to spend time with a classmate (Olivia Cooke) who has leukemia. He and his best friend (RJ Cyler) also make parodies of great films, a subplot that provides some witty cinema in-jokes (stay thru the credits for a complete list of titles). The film's eccentric humor is often clever and fun, although it sometimes try too hard. Once the story hits rocky ground, things quickly fall into emotional drama. Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon has peppered the proceedings with witty angles (literally and figuratively) that add to the movie's oddball charms.",

In addition, the direction from sophomore director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon is gentle and he is comfortable taking a backseat to his young stars here and letting them go, which is perfect. An honest look at both high school, friendships, and death, Me & Earl & the Dying Girl is funny from beginning to end and guaranteed to make you fight back tears (a fight you will more than likely lose). The film is also a film nerds wet dream with so many references and mentions of classic films that the film itself is as much as an homage to classic films as the amateur films made by the characters. Though there are better coming of age dramedies out there, Me & Earl & the Dying Girl is certainly one of the better ones I have seen thanks to great acting, directing, writing, and a heartfelt story that feels so relatable it almost hurts. It is hard to imagine this one not winding up as one of my favorite films of 2015.",

This is a comedy, a quirky comedy but its very much a cringe-enducing form of comedy - a sort of dark comedy very much about social awkwardness, the pitfalls of being less than the all popular guy at the end of high school, i.e. secondary school. There isn't a laughter track or anything like that. It features narration, which is done very much in a blase, whatever, lets just explain this and then I'll move on and get out of your way, kind of a way. It has the feel of an indie cult classic, although I don't honestly remember when I first heard about it but I did enjoy it.Greg has an interesting hobby, which is making parodies of classic films with who he calls his co-worker Earl, rather than a friend. These are obviously done on a much, much lower budget and we're shown a number of covers for said films, which have quite funny word pun type titles, such as 'Rosemary Baby Carrots', 'Brew Velvet' and 'A Sockwork Orange'. I found the clips of said film parodies quite amusing and endearing to an extent - their made via puppet/stop motion animation styles, think papier mache props and the like.I felt sorry for Greg, as I can fairly easily remember what its like to feel like an awkward outsider at school, as he's clearly shown to be. It is quite a quirky film and it reminded me a bit of Napolean Dynamite, although the main character isn't as comic and doesn't stand out in the way that the titular character of that film did.Cast wise, Greg is played by Thomas Mann. He seems pretty much like a regular joe American mid teen. He comes across as relatively apathetic - I'm not sure how else I could describe him. Meanwhile, Earl is played by RJ Cyler, Olivia Cooke plays said dying girl Rachel and Molly Shannon plays Denise.I liked the way the film comes across, with numerous new scenes starting with text across the screen saying the name of that new scene, basically saying what Greg was thinking at that time, such as 'the time Rachel had just started treatment', 'the time I felt so awkward I just had to say something' (as if that only ever happens once, eh?). Content wise, the film features mild sex references and partial nudity. There are instances of mild violence but nothing gorey or graphic is shown as such. There is some swearing and drug reference are also made but otherwise there's little likely to offend people, although obviously the story and themes are pretty sobering and sad. The film has been given a 12 rating due to this.I think it says something about inevitability - its quite a sobering thought. Its definitely (inevitably) not a laugh out loud hilarious type of a film but I did find some parts amusing, although I accept it won't appeal to everyone. I wouldn't say its entirely a drama film, there is a fair amount of quirkiness present - its a bit hard to describe, other than a quirky indie comedy/drama film.Some of the music played was surprisingly distinctive.Tracks featured include In Dreams by Roy Orbison, Trouble by Cat Stevens and I'll Come Running by Brian Eno. Some well known classical pieces played include the Ride of the Valkyries and a few piano pieces which I have no idea what their called.I'd recommend this film, as I found it to be an amusing, quirky, somewhat thought provoking film, one which I imagine quite a few people could relate to. Its an interesting watch, so I'd recommend it on that basis.",
