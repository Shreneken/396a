  "summary": "Six or eight or twelve years after the Civil War, a stagecoach hurtles through the wintry Wyoming landscape. The passengers, bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his fugitive Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), race towards the town of Red Rock where Ruth, known in these parts as “The Hangman,” will bring Domergue to justice. AlongSix or eight or twelve years after the Civil War, a stagecoach hurtles through the wintry Wyoming landscape. The passengers, bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his fugitive Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), race towards the town of Red Rock where Ruth, known in these parts as “The Hangman,” will bring Domergue to justice. Along the road, they encounter two strangers: Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), a black former union soldier turned infamous bounty hunter, and Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), a southern renegade who claims to be the town’s new Sheriff. Losing their lead on the blizzard, Ruth, Domergue, Warren and Mannix seek refuge at Minnie's Haberdashery, a stagecoach stopover on a mountain pass. When they arrive at Minnie’s, they are greeted not by the proprietor but by four unfamiliar faces. Bob (Demian Bichir), who’s taking care of Minnie’s while she’s visiting her mother, is holed up with Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), the hangman of Red Rock, cow-puncher Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), and Confederate General Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern). As the storm overtakes the mountainside stopover, our eight travelers come to learn they may not make it to Red Rock after all.… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "While not as cinematically game-changing as Pulp Fiction or as gore-spattered as the Kill Bill films, The Hateful Eight doles out all of Tarantino’s favorite things.",
    "Tarantino is a masterful storyteller, painter of cinematic images and director of actors; the script, the cinematography and the cast of outlandish characters, created by a powerful ensemble dashingly led by Jackson, can’t be faulted in any way.",
    "This is a high-wire thriller, full of masterfully executed twists, captivating dialogue, and a wildly entertaining narrative that gallops along at a pace to make three hours evaporate in an instant. Best film of the year? Yes.",
    "While it’s not as audacious or as provocative or as brutally violent as “Django Unchained,” it’s still an exhilarating moviegoing experience, filled with wickedly dark humor, nomination-worthy performances and a jigsaw puzzle plot that keeps us guessing until the bloody, brilliant end.",
    "Beautifully photographed to take full advantage of the corners of a 2:76:1 aspect ratio, often hiding key character details in the background of shots in a way that demands a second viewing, this is a gorgeous piece of filmcraft all the way around.",
    "The Hateful Eight is a parlour-room epic, an entire nation in a single room, a film steeped in its own filminess but at the same time vital, riveting and real.",
    "Tarantino has created another breathtakingly stylish and clever film, a Jacobean western, intimate yet somehow weirdly colossal, once again releasing his own kind of unwholesome crazy-funny-violent nitrous oxide into the cinema auditorium for us all to inhale.",
    "This is the writer-director’s take on the betrayed promise of America: a perverse vision of sadistic men comforted by false causes.",
    "The film's chatty, ingratiating, and then howlingly mean.",
    "Those willing to put in the time will find a movie that is both beautiful and hideous, funny and shocking, and even thoughtful on occasion.",
    "The movie absolutely delivers on the sheer moment-to-moment pleasures fans have come to expect, from dynamite dialogue to powder-keg confrontations.",
    "Working from a self-penned screenplay, Tarantino has come up with one of the wordiest Westerns on record, and even some of his most diehard fans may grimace at the film’s occasionally slow pace. But The Hateful Eight more than compensates through its intriguing characters, ominous atmosphere and palpable suspense.",
    "But Tarantino isn’t glorifying the ugliness; he’s condemning it. He just wants to put on a grand show at the same time. “Are you not entertained?” he seems to be asking. Yes. Yes, we are.",
    "At three hours, this Western whodunit can feel like too much of a good thing. But Tarantino writes like a flamethrower. His incendiary dialogue feels like profane poetry. And the dude thinks big.",
    "There are a couple hiccups that prevent the movie from elevating to the classic status of your Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fictions.",
    "On a par with \"Inglourious Basterds\" and \"Django Unchained,\" The Hateful Eight starts low-key but ultimately delivers big, bold, blood-soaked rewards. Roll on, QT Western number three.",
    "The Hateful Eight brands the western with a big ‘QT’. All you’d expect from a Tarantino movie and more besides. Saddle up.",
    "My personal view is that Quentin Tarantino is now permanently high on his own supply, but you could just as well say that he has succeeded in reinventing the art film. Is it worth it to put yourself through the brutal and incoherent three-hour ordeal of The Hateful Eight for its moments of brilliance and its ultimate catharsis? Jesus, don’t look at me.",
    "A highly enjoyable -- and, for better or for worse, a very Tarantino -- movie.",
    "It’s as pure an expression of Tarantino’s voice as he’s ever mustered—easy to savor, even if the aftertaste leaves a trace of nasty bitterness.",
    "The Hateful Eight’s impact expands and grows richer the further away you are from the experience of watching it.",
    "There is absolutely no doubt about who wrote the elaborate, pungent, profane and often funny dialogue that a fine cast chews over and spits out with evident glee, nor as to who staged the ongoing bloodbath that becomes a gusher in the final stretch.",
    "Overall, it’s a satisfying wintry treat, as only Quentin Tarantino can do it.",
    "Even if you don’t get the references, you can enjoy the ripely robust acting – especially Russell, Jackson and Leigh – and Tarantino’s storytelling skill. I could have done without the bad-boy excesses, which always seem like the mark of his immaturity, but the rest of the film comes from a mature and capable artist.",
    "This is a movie that’s 168 minutes only because Quentin Tarantino is an uncontainable Rabelasian. He believes that more is more. And sometimes it is. But a truly great craftsman knows where to locate the line.",
    "Needless to say, if “Inglourious Basterds” and “Django Unchained” were too much for you, The Hateful Eight won’t be any easier. This is a big step beyond.",
    "The Hateful Eight is a feature-length battle between thoughtful sophistication and the filmmaker's sloppiest and most self-indulgent instincts.",
    "The premise of the film is simple, but it's a simplicity that can only attract complications, as simple plans are apt to do, in an atmosphere of foreboding and the macabre.",
    "No matter how absorbing its individual scenes, however, The Hateful Eight is often hindered by Tarantino's confidence in the material. For every gripping sequence, there's an abrupt development or undercooked throwaway line.",
    "The Hateful Eight may frustrate some of his more literally sanguine supporters, but it’s nonetheless an entertaining piece of dialogue-driven theater — with the occasional rifle-shot to the head.",
    "Tarantino seems to have no shortage of creativity or inspiration. What he needs to find is someone who isn’t afraid to occasionally say, “Cut.”",
    "Weird, wild and way-too-long.",
    "It’s arguably Tarantino’s ugliest and most political film, but not his best by some distance.",
    "Stretched to three hours, including a pointless (old fashioned) overture and intermission, does it live up to the “Cinema Event” Tarantino has hyped it as? Hell no. It’s just a minimalist Spaghetti Western suffering from auteur bloat — sometimes entertaining,  with not even remotely enough story of action to support its insuperable length and gravitas.",
    "The Hateful Eight is easily Tarantino's most fantastic film in terms of its visuals, its period detail and its award-worthy score, but it suffers from the director's common pitfalls while lacking the verve that so often carries him through.",
    "Maybe I’m repeating myself: The Hateful Eight is a Quentin Tarantino movie. But Mr. Tarantino is also repeating himself, spinning his wheels here in a way he has rarely done before. None of his other films venture so far into tedium or manage to get in their own way so frequently.",
    "It’s fun for a while to see Kurt Russell hamming it up behind his voluminous mustache or Samuel L. Jackson once again raising rafters by laying down the law. But the film is pointless, even as entertainment, because it builds to nothing more than a comic book blood bath.",
    "The Hateful Eight doesn’t have enough ideas. Set almost entirely in a snowed-in saloon, the story’s so spare it doesn’t warrant either its three-hour running time (including an overture and intermission) or his use of 70mm projection. It’s narratively and visually claustrophobic.",
    "By the end of The Hateful Eight, its status as a tale of mystery and its deference to classic Westerns have all but disappeared, worn down by the grind of its sadistic vision. That is the Tarantino deal: by blowing out folks’ brains, he wants to blow our minds.",
    "Yep, we’re in Tarantino territory for sure: way too self-indulgently long, and way, way overboard with that N-word.",
    "This time the talk was cheap, not witty or sharp. Tarantino the writer let his gift of gab get away from him and didn't give his script a close enough edit. Tarantino the director didn't do enough with the static setting; the flashbacks don't help and the big timeshift that's meant to explain everything that's happened feels incomplete.",
    "The Hateful Eight is an ultrawide bore.",
    "An impressive display of film craft and a profoundly ugly movie—so gleeful in its violence and so nihilistic in its world view that it feels as though the director is daring his detractors to see it as a confirmation of their worst fears about his art.",
    "An epic work of self-indulgence and smug riffing, stringing together tropes from TV and screen westerns and closed-room whodunits, The Hateful Eight announces itself with all the pomp and circumstance of a mid-century cinema spectacle.",
    "The Hateful Eight is bold, gorgeous, verbally clever, morally repellent, and, in some way I am still struggling to put my finger on, possibly somehow evil. Any movie that inspires mixed feelings that intense can, I suppose, be said to have done its work on the viewer. But I’m not sure the work The Hateful Eight performed on me was what the filmmaker intended or that it’s an operation I would consent to again.",
    "Its glorious, snow-capped visuals aside, The Hateful Eight comes off as haggard and atrophied. It’s bloodless even in the midst of all its bloodiness; its characters are devoid of nobility, even the horrible kind. These are uglies not even a mother could love.",
    "The Hateful Eight never lives up to its intriguing opening minutes and provocative premise, its wide-screen canvas wasted on a talky, claustrophobic chamber piece that descends, in due Tarantino fashion, into a mean-spirited slough of bloodshed and mayhem.",
    "You wonder what he has up his sleeve in The Hateful Eight, but gorgeous as that sleeve might be, what’s up it is crap. The movie is a lot of gore over a lot of nothing. I hope that won’t be Tarantino’s epitaph.",
    "Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight is vile art, bludgeoning viewers for three hours with indefensibly gratuitous race baiting and blood.",
    "The Hateful Eight is basically an expensive vanity project allowing Tarantino to expound on his bizarre theories about race relations.",
    "The Hateful Eight wears out its welcome well before the halfway point, leaving the equivalent of a whole other movie to sit — and suffer — through."

No one seems toBased on the 168 minute version.\r There's no denying Quentin Tarantino's twisted genius and perverse vision. His films are unapologetic challenges to share the roller-coaster as long as one accepts Tarantino run the ride. No one seems to mind. It may be time to challenge that precept.\r In a \"Playboy\" interview, Tarantino stated, \"I just don't want to be an old-man filmmaker.\" Pure Tarantino, \"The Hateful Eight\" is poetic, profane, laconic, really nasty, bloody as all hell, and meditative; the first half - uncharacteristically old man-y, moody and brooding with meaningful dialogue sharp as a razor. There's promise of a re-think as if Tarantino's voice finally broke to adult from adolescent. Then the film derails to the usual Tarantino high jinks.\r This filmmaker is a master at creating tension; cinematic foreplay teasing and teasing until big, sweet, orgiastic release in blood and guts. He also deconstructs and spins plot twists and turns into gold. That task is easy in, essentially, a stage play with eight trapped in one room. A Tarantino film with social commentary as text, the subject under the microscope is race hatred. Setting the film post-Civil War allows the saying of things unacceptable in contemporary society. Like \"Django Unchained,\" nary a few minutes pass without a \"ni**er.\" And the room is divided into North and South.\r The length works against this film. At 168 minutes it was quite enough. The added twenty-odd minutes in the roadshow version might make the experience interminable. The film runs out of steam as it plays out and plays out with dialogue between the bang-bang – and there is plenty of blood.\r Then there's misogyny. \"The Hateful Eight\" revels in the abuse of Jennifer Jason Lee, even with her portrayal of a scheming, cold-hearted killer. Her multiple beatings and battered face appears as if a domestic violence victim – most unappealing.\r The cast does well with the material. There are no standouts, really, but Tim Roth channels Cristoph Waltz who must have been busy.\r The cinematography is spectacular. Not necessarily the lighting, but the incredible use of the wide screen frame. The look and feel is evocative of David Lean epics Tarantino emulates even to the use of 'Roadshow', a practice that passed out of favor fifty years ago. Films are no longer shot this way. In this regard it was a pleasure to watch.\r If Tarantino wished to create the emotion of hate in the audience, he succeeded. The hate spills over the footlights, but there is a fine line between using verbiage and posture to underscore race hatred and making a racist (and misogynistic) film. More than in other films, \"The Hateful Eight\" crosses that line. This film again leads to question Tarantino's personal attitude. He becomes more suspect peppering scripts with \"ni**er\" - even in his contemporary films (joining real life \"Black Lives Matter\" protesters notwithstanding). Sometimes racists hide behind satire and commentary. Every use of \"ni**er\" is another nail in that coffin. Also, his neurotic mentions of big black c**k in several films (here, sucking) skews toward wish fulfillment.\r This is a very distasteful, caveman film within grand entertainment. That push-pull leads to a zero sum, and self-reflection as to what exactly is entertaining about \"The Hateful Eight.\" Given the dichotomy, not a lot.",

What's also great is the casting of Samuel L. Jackson. And now for the film. There's probably one big problem for most people here and that's the pacing. The movie is almost three hours long and not much happens for about an hour and a half. I didn't find that a problem and I'm not even a Tarantino fan. I don't mind slow movies in general, but for a lot of people, half the movie will probably be an ordeal. Later on, things start to happen and the plot gets pretty interesting and raises a few questions, which are of course answered at the end and you are left with a clearer picture when the film is over. What added to the film's juice were the frequent n-words, which Tarantino just isn't afraid of. I enjoyed myself and although the film was slow as I mentioned, I personally found it interesting. I don't know whether to recommend it then, because after all the pace probably won't suit everyone. In addition to that, the film changes a minimum of locations and the plot takes place in the same place, which will probably also displease a few people and I was a bit disappointed at the beginning, but it gradually stopped bothering me because I just found the plot interesting. For me, the film was great and I'll put it this way. I recommend it to fans of the director, because his style is classically signed here, for example in the form of chapter divisions or the occasional narrator speaking into the plot. Perhaps even more fans of the genre might find it fitting.",

But it sure is, but not everybody appears to agree on that since, yes; it’s a slow film and there are some boring moments (!). QT is back with his most intense dialog-driven flick that might not surpass his previous films but it’s a near, but deeper, miss. It’s all about human traits, and this might be a meh-film for some, but a masterpiece for others. But it sure isn’t a wild action-western. The well written dialogs keeps the film have this cold, dark & deep feel for these crazy, sick & wild characters. The film is highly driven on unpredictability. The plot is like a puzzle; many small events that eventually leads to something greater (& bloody). TH8 is a brave move by Quentin, and a highly original and artistic one. Too slow plot, too dialog-driven, too stereotypical & a lack of plot-development & top-notch humor, might be flaws for some. But the beauty of basic filmmaking with stunning camerawork and a clever editing; well Tarantino does not lack creativity.\r Personal rating: 73/100\rCritical rating: 87/100",

What's sad is that it starts off wonderfully -- I felt myself\rgetting excited by the prospect of Tarantino returning to form for\rabout a half hour -- then keeps getting sillier and sillier until it's\rnothing but a comedy -- and the comedy is so unsubtle, it might have\rbeen made by Mel Brooks or Jerry Lewis on acid.\r What's funny is the much touted, rich color of the Panavision stock and\rthe fake cabin interior of \"Minnies Haberdashery (not a hat in sight)\"\rmakes the film look like the over-saturated movies from the sixties\rlike \"Paint Your Wagon\" which always looked vaguely fake to me -- a\rplastic universe cobbled together on a back lot and lit with huge\roverhead arc lights. Add big splashes of red blood and it started to\rlook like the garish color of some the 60s Disney films, so there was\rthis bizarre set of associations going through my head.\r When the finale of the film turns to grand guignol slapstick in these\rhyper-pumped colors, I felt like I was having a flashback to a bad 60s\rDick van Dyke comedy like \"Fitzwilly\" or \"Cold Turkey,\" and, honestly,\rI left the theater stunned by the near absurdity of it all. It's as if\rsomeone unearthed an awful 60s comedy (Sergio Leone? Hah? That's a\rlaugh) that was buried in the vaults by the studios.\r This \"love letter to the cinema\" is really a love letter to himself, as\rTarantino riffs off elements of his own movies like \"Reservoir Dogs\"\rand throws in some steals from Paul Thomas Anderson (it almost sounds\rlike Anderson doing the narration. Narration? Where the $%^& did that\rcome from? Wow, talk about the weakest attempt I've ever seen to clue\ran audience when some sloppy structuring fails the film.)\r The dialogue is Tarantino-lite, like a second-rate writer trying to\rimitate him (Samuel Jackson's goading of Bruce Dern is probably the\rworst monologue Tarantino has written) and the story is Agatha Christie\rwith a lobotomy. There are some good performances (Kurt Russell is\rgreat as John Wayne) and some awful ones (Tim Roth at his over-the-top\rworst) but the film itself unravels like a spoonful of spaghetti\rWestern. And this isn't a spaghetti Western, it's a pizza and beer\rcomedy. I'm sure it will be a big hit at frat houses across America.\r I'm amazed how some people (known critics, as well) even venture to\rjustify the racial undercurrent as social commentary. Tarantino has\rnever written symbolically or allegorically. He writes character, and\rthat's that. \"The Hateful Eight\" is a \"political statement\" in the same\rway that \"I Spit on Your Grave\" is an indictment of contemporary\rreligion. Please.\r How do I sum this movie up in one word? Well, the one that comes to the\rtop of my head right now is: \"Goofy.\" Maybe those big Panavision camera\rgot to Tarantino because he subconsciously started to think he was\rmaking a bloody version of \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.\"\r\r\nI need to have a drink.

Not for kids to read.\r People, I haven't gotten on and ranted about a horrible movie since Noah but as a public service I have to warn you all against this piece of trash.\r Don't get me wrong, I am (or was) a big Tarantino fan. I loved pulp fiction, loved the Kill Bills, loved Inglorious Bastards, loved death proof...even loved Django (though the gratuitous violence and constant use of the N word was beginning to get old.)\r This movie though.... seriously, I should have got up and left half way through when Sam L. Jackson (in a horrific flash back) forces fellatio on a naked white guy who's on his knees begging for a blanket in the snow (Sam laughing his big signature Sam L. Jackson laugh the whole time). But I in cowardice looked away and waited for the movie to get better. It didn't.\r From the running gags where Jennifer Jason Leigh is repeatedly called a **** and punched in the face until her front teeth break off and she's covered in blood, to the big finally where Jackson (barely conscious from having his nuts shot off) along with a horrible mortally wounded racist sheriff team up to (in their dying moments) deliver true justice to Leigh but noosing her and lifting her to the rafters until she slowly dances to death at the end of the rope, this movie is nothing but gore-porn idiocy.\r There are no heroes to root for there are no Nazis or slave masters to hate. Everyone is horrible. Everything is violent. Everything is.... well... just gross. To make matters worse it's frekking BORING! After a relatively hopeful first half hour or so with a few funny bits, some smart dialogue, some dramatic building and beautiful scenery... the thing basically becomes a bloated whodunit play with every other line containing the word **** or **** I was so bored I nearly fell asleep two hours in. It just drags on and on.\r I literally felt dirty driving home. It really made me question my own media consumption habits and where I draw my lines in life. Maybe I should have know better? Perhaps I should have drawn the line at the rape scene in Kill Bill 12 years ago. But the would be rapist immediately gets his ass handed to him in that movie by one of the most interesting bad ass heroines to grace the silver screen. Creative,violent revenge against horrible people is intriguing and at times invigorating and delightful in Tarintinos previous films. The purposeless over the top all around evil in this one though... it just goes too far down a very dark road.\r I don't know.... This one really made me question my own discernment.

If you’ve seen Django Unchained, then you know he’s pretty loose with the n-word, too. Some people called it “authentic,” but I felt it was a little jarring. There was a point early in the movie when one character drops the n-word and another character says, “You know, black people don’t like to be called that.” At this point, I wondered if this film would be free of the n-word, or at least very light on it. Psych! The rest of the movie is very heavy on the word.\r The movie itself seemed like a stage play. One character walks up to another character and spills his entire life story as an introduction. The second character responds by spilling his entire life story. Both stories serve as an introduction for the audience, but come off as un-natural. I had a writing teacher describe this as “soap opera dialogue.” It was odd to see it on-screen. The Broadway production of The Hateful Eight is gonna be huge.\r The gore was heavy… In some parts of the movie I would consider it over-the-top. There was one scene that caused all of us to gasp. If you’ve seen The Kingsman, and you call that a “ten” for violence, I’d call this one an “eight.” It sneaks up on you, too. For the first part of the movie, little to no violence. Then BAM! Violence is hot and heavy. There’s at least one scene where I think there was violence just for violence sake–I don’t think it was realistic for that character to act that way.\r If you put the language and gore aside, how was the movie? Well, it’s quite a lot of both to put aside, but I’ll try. It definitely put you into what Wyoming during a blizzard in the Old West would feel like. The sets and costumes looked terribly authentic. You see characters ride in a stage coach, and you find yourself marveling at how rough it seems in comparison to modern automobiles.\r The characters wind up in a trading post cabin in the middle of nowhere on their way to a town in the middle of nowhere. It oozes authenticity, and is an eye-opener to what life was like in the Wild, Wild West.\r But the language and gore… It was tough to stomach. Was language really that rough at that time? I thought language of today was a product of hip-hop, street culture. Am I just being racist? I need to do some Googling now and find out when heavy language became a “thing.”",

Presented in 70mm and complete with an overture and intermission, this can be seen as either a vanity undertaking by its director or as a passion project by someone who loves cinema and the old traditions it stood for. The story outline is a mere strand and it is overblown to epic proportions (a staggering 187 minutes) that it cannot possibly hope to sustain. Things start promisingly enough with Kurt Russell’s bounty hunter escorting Jennifer Jason Leigh’s Daisy, by stagecoach in a raging blizzard, to her date with destiny on the gallows. En-route they meet up with Samuel L Jackson and Walton Goggins before holing up with the rest of the titular number in a cabin which is the home of ‘Minnie’s Haberdashery’. The torturous corkscrewing of the plot plays out from here, but interest is lost after a while due to the overly talky first half. The intermission when it comes is almost a relief. Things pick up considerably after the break and the screenplay introduces flashbacks, narration and a plot twist that livens things up no end. These devices are, in fact, Tarantino’s forte. This second half also lets rip in the blood letting department and anyone who has seen a Tarantino film before will know exactly what to expect. The cast have a lot of fun, with the best performances coming from Samuel L Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh and, especially, an unknown Walton Goggins. The film is technically proficient, although when the actors are competing with both Ennio Morricone’s forceful score and the sound effects of the raging blizzard, much dialogue is lost as a result. The 70 mm presentation is stunning and Robert Richardson’s cinematography of both interiors and exteriors is ravishingly beautiful. It may not be vintage Tarantino, but despite the flaws it somehow manages to stay with you long after you have left the cinema.",

This is one of the only movies I ever fell asleep in, and it was for about fifteen minutes during that opening phase when the stagecoach is heading for the cabin or store or haberdashery, whatever the place is.\r I do not recommend this movie, but if you must see it, rent it and fast forward when things get slow.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nQuentin Tarantino should really remake The Thing. In fact, he easily could remake it with the cast and setting of this very film. Heck, he already has an incredible Oscar-winning Ennio Morricone who unironically utilizes unpublished excerpts from his The Thing soundtrack. He has The Thing star, Kurt Russell. He has an isolated cabin in a blizzard. Had the cabin has some dogs outside that started barking when Samuel L Jackson came near this would have been a better movie for it. (And it would have let Morricone reuse some his soundtrack from that Kristy McNichol vehicle White Dog that he penned the same year as his Thing soundtrack.)That the idea above is an overly film geeky and a silly genre switcheroo is what one used to hope for from a Tarantino film. This film, however, plays out much more straight and really doesn’t hold it’s most interesting gambits that it does keep. Kurt Russell has a prisoner played by Jennifer Jason Leigh that he is stubbornly bringing in alive. He is convinced (correctly) that one or more people trapped in this cabin with him are working against him to free his charge. The movie threatens to break into a surprisingly engaging Agatha Christie-style mystery. Unfortunately, Tarantino switches gears about the time it starts to get interesting. This being a Tarantino movie we are awash in an excess of blood and cruelty and racial epithets. Alas, the film simply doesn’t earn them as well as say Reservoir Dogs did. There are some great set pieces that I will not spoil but they are surrounded by a lot of slow. Tarantino might argue (correctly) that he with his score, 70mm filming, and pacing is aping the style of the old three-hours western such as Once upon a Time in the West, or the Dollars trilogy.  But seriously have you sat through one of those in one films in one sitting in the last twenty years? It can be a slog. This film can be a slog.All the actors (sans Madsen) do a great job. The soundtrack is wonderful. Parts of the movie such as the Agatha Christie bits mentioned above really work well. Alas, there are some things that simply do not work. There is an overlong flashback that basically takes all the mystery out of the last act. Tarantino's narration is jarring, poorly done and unnecessary. The first hour of the movie takes that hour to tell twenty minutes of setup. Overall worth a watch for Tarantino fans and for Jennifer Jason Leigh’s fantastic performance. But like those three-hour westerns of old, I don’t see myself watching it again.",

After sitting through The Hateful Eight (THE) however I'm concluded that this is one of his weaker offerings.\r While one of the strengths of Tarantino's films is held to be dialogue - I think THE manages to cross the line from smart and immersive dialogue into borderline pointless self-indulgence. Endless discussions between characters which don't necessarily add much to the progression of the plot (such as it is).\r The narrative itself has some appeal - but it's strung out over such a long time-frame and climaxes in a pretty banal shower of blood that leaves the viewer wondering why they sat through 2.5 hours of smug dialogue just for a pretty standard bloodletting in the last 15 minutes.\r There's some good characters there - and some interesting moments; a strong cast makes for enjoyable viewing in parts, but in my view this film doesn't have enough substance to warrant it's length. Nor does it hold the viewer's attention for the duration in the same manner as the director's previous film.\r Also borderline irritating is the niggling feeling that we're being preached at with some sort of social or political perspective which undermines historical authenticity (though this is a minor point as I doubt the film is trying to be authentic any more than a comic book western is shooting for historical accuracy).\r In summary - it's OK - but self-indulgent and ultimately underwhelming.",

I will say that it's a really good movie, but not a great one. Let me split the movie into roughly three acts. As for the first act, I felt that it went on for too long. Most Tarantinto fans realize that he likes his really drawn out scenes of nothing but pure dialouge. And it's fine when it works, but for the first third of this movie, it takes way to long to set up its characters. And not all of them are even introduced until closer to the second third of the movie. And plus, Walton Goggins got really annoying from the get go. In a nutshell, the first third had me worried. But by the time we jump into the second act, the dialouge starts to get more interesting and the movie starts to take a different turn and reveal itself. The who done it storyline really starts to becoming engaging in great Tarantino fashion. You start putting the pieces of the puzzle together. By the third act, the dialouge still becomes intriguing in the longer and drawn out scenes. However, they never got boring by this point because we're into the thick of the meat (metaphorically speaking). So in a nutshell, \"The Hateful Eight\" has a slow setup, but once you really get into the main plot, it's a free for all and a rather fun and crazy one to say the least. I wish the movie didn't waste it's time so much with its slow first act. It could have been an all around great Tarantino movie. Nevertheless, it was still a fun movie to watch and I'm glad I did watch it. And I'm glad it got even better as the film went on. I'm going to give \"The Hateful Eight\" a B+!",

And yet, like his films, Tarantino intended to present his sly and ultra-violent eighth film in the most roadshow way possible; with an overture, intermission and in 70mm no less. Maybe your wondering, after eight films, has Tarantino out done himself, especially after the exceptional critical and commercial praise of Django Unchained, for which he won an Academy Award in the Original Screenplay category? The answer my friends is, as Samuel L. Jackson so coyly says within the first lines of the film, “Got room for one more?”, cause Tarantino ain’t going anywhere yet!\r Tarantino’s newest film, The Hateful Eight is every bit as brilliant, violent, unapologetic and masterful than his last, plus some. Writing in a way that can only Tarantino can write, The Hateful Eight proves that the master scribbler has no intention of letting up, or letting lose of his racial, sexist and down-right offensive subject matter in his older age.\r But before we get into all that, lets take a little history lesson…\r Back in 2014, the original script for the film leaked online, which gave Tarantino a very easy choice to make, he scrapped the project in pre-production altogether. Opting to make the film a novella instead, a cast was chosen to give a brief reading of the script in LA. The cast, who is almost identical to the final cast seen in the film, with the stark exception of Jennifer Jason Leigh, who replaced Amber Tamblyn in the read as Daisy Domergue, as well as the addition of Demián Bichir and a super secret role of Channing Tatum, The Hateful Eight saw the light after all. Thankfully, after a very successful and publicized read, and with the help of the convincing of good friend Samuel L. Jackson, a frequent collaborator of Tarantino, the writer extraordinaire re-wrote the first draft of the script, created two new alternative endings, and announced his plans to continue with The Hateful Eight as his next film. Alas, here I am today.\r The film, which circles mostly among eight main characters, tells the story of a hangman, John “The Hangman” Ruth (Kurt Russell), who is notorious for claiming his earning with subject who are alive, and his seamlessly impossible quest of getting the wanted Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a woman convicted of murder, to the proper authorities for a hefty bounty. Unknown to him at the time on his way to Red Rocks, Colorado, Ruth’s coach, steered by the steady O.B Jackson (James Parks), encounters one helluva winter storm. Untrusting of anyone and everyone, except O.B, the storm swallows the travelling companions of two men; Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), also a bounty hunter, with some precious cargo of his own, and one Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), an ex Lost-Causer militiaman who is on his way to Red Rocks to claim his new badge as Sherriff and inevitably, issue both Ruth and Warren, their bounty prizes. Too many coincidences yet? Trust me, we are just getting started.\r As the two horseless men make their way on Ruth’s coach, Ruth makes an alliance with Major Warren, to both protect their bounties from anyone threatening to take it away from them. While the three men bond in the most bizarre ways, Mannix, an ex Confederate, laughs in the face of Major Warren and his conquests during the Civil War, showing just how stormy the next chapters of this epic story will actually be. As the storm takes a turn for the worst, the coach and all its occupants are forced to seek refuge in Minnie’s (Dana Gourrier) Haberdashery, a cozy and warm little stagecoach lodge the middle of nowhere.\r Once settled, paranoia levels are high while we are introduced to the rest of Tarantino’s Hateful Eight. Among the new eight are; Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) a quiet man who so happens to be at Minnie’s on the quest to see his mother; General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) an old Confederate General who is just being cozy playing chess; Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), the hangman responsible of the actual hanging of Daisy once at Red Rocks, and my personal favourite Bob The Mexican (Damián Bichir), the only person in charge of running Minnie’s place while she is ‘conveniently’ away with her husband Sweet Dave (Gene Jones). Once the already inhabitant guests greet the new coach full of killers, bounty hunters and coachmen, the stage is set for one of the best whodunnits films in recent memory.\r Essentially, this is Tarantino’s first attempt at a mystery film and without question, what a success it is. As expected, Tarantino, arguably, one of the best actor directors working today (and even possibly, of all-time), assembles a stellar cast full of vivid characters.",
