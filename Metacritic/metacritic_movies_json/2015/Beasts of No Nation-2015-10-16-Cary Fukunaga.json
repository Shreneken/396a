    "summary": "When civil war tears his family apart, a young West African boy is forced to join a unit of mercenary fighters and transform into a child soldier.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Fukunaga imbues this study of ma\u00adnipu\u00adla\u00adtion and manufactured loyalty with an unsettling degree of visual richness and lush natural detail.",
        "I never felt emotionally exploited by the terrors on screen. Rather, Beasts of No Nation is an act of gripping empathy.",
        "Cary Fukunaga\u2019s stark, beautifully shot drama was likely never meant to be a blockbuster; its brutal account of a child soldier in an unnamed African country is far too discomfiting for wider audiences. It absolutely does belong on a big screen, though, and more important, it just deserves to be seen.",
        "Matching Fukunaga's proven storytelling grace with a story truly worth the telling, the result is explosively authentic and yet lyrical, making an utterly inhumane and alien situation both completely real and completely abstract.",
        "Fukunaga not only directed the film but also co-wrote the screenplay and served as director of photography.  His efforts have resulted in a brazenly confident piece of cinematic art where every image immerses you deeper and deeper into Agu\u2019s horror.",
        "Fukunaga\u2019s hurtling camera and taut cutting keep Beasts of No Nation only just this side of hallucinatory, and Elba is the kind of titanic actor to kick it to a near-mythic level.",
        "This is a harrowing film to watch. In spite of the vibrant jungle greens and the searing sun, it\u2019s as bleak a vision of modern warfare as has ever been put on screen.",
        "The necessity of circumstances dictates everything anyone does here and you can only react with varying degrees of outrage, anger, disgust, pity, empathy and, if you're a blind optimist, hope for something better.",
        "The idea that there may be life after war and murder, even for the murderers, and what that might look like \u2014 what burdens you might be allowed to put down and what you\u2019ll carry forward forever. The movie\u2019s too wise, and too weary, to have a moral beyond that.",
        "Fukunaga is a dazzling stylist, and at times the shifting palettes of the cinematography and the brilliant camera moves (he\u2019s also the DP on this film) are so impressive as to be marginally distracting.",
        "It's the remarkable Attah, whose young face reflects a hellish journey, that makes this fierce movie a blazing, indelible achievement.",
        "Beasts of No Nation is the kind of sincere, powerful filmmaking that gives socially conscious drama a good name.",
        "A bold portrayal of a boy soldier in a brutal, bloody conflict, anchored by commanding performances from Idris Elba and 14 year-old newcomer Abraham Attah.",
        "Part war story, part endurance test, this harrowing portrait of a young boy\u2019s loss of innocence is gripping, gruelling, grown-up fare. That said, some judicious trimming wouldn\u2019t have hurt.",
        "The film can get so emotionally and spiritually punishing that it needs Elba\u2019s industrial magnetism to keep you on side. And vile as the Commandant may be, he\u2019s a strong showcase for the actor\u2019s talents.",
        "Fukunaga and his actors - especially the two leads - have managed to create a riveting drama which is suitably appalling.",
        "Fukunaga brings flair, muscular storytelling, directness and a persuasively epic sweep to this brutal, heartrending movie.",
        "Full of committed performances, particularly from Elba and the impressive young actor Abraham Attah, Beasts Of No Nation is a project of considerable integrity which makes for a consistently-engrossing, if over-long, viewing experience.",
        "The atrocities against children begin to acquire an unwelcome redundancy in their relentlessness and threaten to inure the viewer.",
        "Beasts on No Nation makes a terrific vehicle for Elba and a grim reminder that even if we\u2019re tired of hearing of it.",
        "The real star is Attah, a Ghanaian street kid plucked from obscurity, who imbues Agu with just the right mix of terror, brutality and the last remaining vestiges of boyish innocence.",
        "The country goes unnamed, the warring factions aren't always clear, but the nightmarish exploitation of children is made specific in the most vivid, visceral ways.",
        "The world here is so ugly that only beautiful tracking shots, rich close-ups and adroit handheld work could make it bearable.",
        "The movie itself is an effective nightmare, and a solid piece of filmmaking, strong enough to make you wish that it could have borne the full weight of the tragedy it set out to depict.",
        "While Fukunaga creates Agu\u2019s world with an extraordinary attentiveness to detail, he hasn\u2019t quite found a way to approximate the novel\u2019s radically childlike perspective, or to bridge the gap between this child soldier\u2019s psyche and our own.",
        "The film in the end seems more of an expertly orchestrated blood bath than a full-scale tragedy.",
        "The film is good to excellent in every way except morally, and there it's questionable more often than it should be, not because it's an evil film, or because the filmmaker or actors are bad people, but because the interplay of means and ends have been under-thought or misjudged, to the point where the film becomes a catalog of obscenities.",
        "The problem with Beasts Of No Nation is that it approaches war largely on the level aesthetic challenge, meaning that whatever sense of revulsion it creates comes from the personality of Commandant. It\u2019s his absence, rather than memories of murder and rape, that hangs like a dark cloud over the movie\u2019s intriguingly unresolved epilogue.",
        "Sure to be a favorite with racists, Beasts of No Nation sheds no light whatsoever on Africa\u2019s civil wars but turns its gaze on black people brutalizing one another with machetes, howitzers, rifles and anything else that comes to hand. I picture Calvin Candie, the plantation owner in \u201cDjango Unchained,\u201d yelling, \u201cYeah! Git \u2019em!\u201d",
        "Cary Joji Fukunaga\u2019s artistry registers less as psychological imprint than as a measure of his professional bona fides."

Beasts of No Nation allows us to see it first hand. Director Cary Fukunaga may be one of the best directors around when it comes to showing us absolutely brutal and incredibly visceral looks at life in war torn regions (Sin Nombre being the other film by him to do this, but in South America). Incredibly powerful, violent, and intense, Beasts of No Nation will undoubtedly go down as one of the best films of 2015. The cinematography is gorgeous, as in all of Fukunaga's work, but the strongest element in the film are the characters. Every character truly elicits an emotional response within you. Their stories, their presence, and their power, all resonate with the viewer. Fukunaga does a great job creating characters we care about in such a mess of destruction and devastation. Through both his direction and writing, we truly get the full impact of their trauma and that makes this one all the more powerful. The acting is also incredible. Abraham Attah turns in one of the best performances from a child actor I have ever seen and Idris Elba is phenomenal. A truly wondrous film, Beasts of No Nation is one of the best films of the year and deserves to be recognized as such.",

The story follows young AguThere were moments in Beasts Of No Nation where I had to pause the film to process what I had just seen. There is an unquestionable force released by Cary Fukunaga (True Detective, Sin Nombre) and onto the viewer. The story follows young Agu (newcomer Abraham Attah) torn away from his family, who were murdered by ruthless soldiers, which forces Agu to flee and join a rebel group that fights against the soldiers who killed Agu's family. First and foremost, Abraham Attah was brilliant, not brilliant as in amazing but as in powwrful, emotional and simply killer. Idris Elba plays the commandant of the group, and boy can that guy act. Elba is smoking hot on screen, and simply watching him can give you goosebumps. No Nation touches many sensitive issues such as child soldiers, children on drugs and tobacco, how families are ripped apart and the stores of those who have been through it all. Agu is forced to kill, use drugs, smoke, swear and be turned into a beast rather than a playful and loving child. Supporting cast is good as well. No Nation isn't a evil movie, it tells us what evil can do to a young, growing child, the commandant isn't a bad person in his own way, he just wants revenge. Anyway, this film also questions you in ways you would have ever thought of. But beware, if you can't handle it don't watch it, some of my friends walked out because of the terror displayed in killings. But overall, brilliant and harrowing piece of work, and truly is on the road to the Oscars. Another reason why you should get Netflix.",

Attah Abraham is a great actor for his age and gives great narration as well as a wholly convincing tragic monologue about his loss of innocence. The rest of the cast is spectacular as well. Not to mention the camera is so well directed it sometimes makes you feel like a part of the rebel force. The movie is well done and worthy of attention.\r This war drama is portrayed as artistically as the genre will allow for. The controversial subject of child soldiers is not shied away from even though some of the horror is implied off screen. The plight of the boy soldier seems accurately depicted while the actual countries and factions are left purposely vague. It's not a story about politics or right and wrong, it's a story about the cost of war on the people who are caught up in it. You may find yourself enamored by the charismatic commandant, unsure of what you want Agu to do next. That sort of confusion is what the main character is also feeling and the fact that I felt it while watching the story unfold is an accomplishment of the film.\r Despite the many dismal scenes, after the movie is over you will want more of the story. This may be due to the ending itself which feels unresolved, but I also attribute this desire for more to the excellent story telling and cinematography of the action. The only problem I have with this movie is that it ended too soon. Great movie!",

With a small budget that can\u2019t compete with the major film studios, they\u2019ve opted for creativity and daring to break into a major part of the movie industry they may well revolutionize.\r This is not the first film we\u2019ve seen about African child soldiers, but it\u2019s the first that will be seen by a large western audience and manages to capture the raw realism of \u2018Johnny Mad Dog\u2019 and \u2018Ezra\u2019 while combining it with the focused energy and compelling narrative of favela drama \u2018City of God\u2019, all while learning the lessons about the madness of war from the classics of the last 40 years.\r \u2018Beasts of No Nation\u2019 is an incredibly brutal and violent but powerful drama that focuses an unflinching look at the plight of child soldiers in Africa. By not setting the story in a specific country it represents the horrors inflicted upon children in countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone over the last few decades, and indeed it could apply to child soldiers in South America and the more recent horrifying corruption of children by \u201cIslamic State\u201d. All of which raises uncomfortable questions about the West\u2019s selective moral outrage and lack of action when it come to global injustice.\r As the lead \u201cAgu\u201d in his acting debut and \u201cBest Young Actor\u201d award winner at the Venice Film Festival, Ghanaian schoolboy Abraham Attah, 13 years old at the time of filming, delivers an incredibly nuanced performance that\u2019s as good as any child acting display we\u2019ve seen. Idris Elba also shines as the charismatic and domineering rebel commandant, while Cary Joji Fukunaga\u2019s direction is assured and his adaptation of Uzo Iweala\u2019s novel is effective, as is the striking cinematography that captures the vivid greens and yellows of the Ghanian landscape where this was filmed.\r There are some who have criticised \u2018Beasts of No Nation\u2019 for its narrow focus on the plight of child soldiers within the larger context of African civil wars. This shows a fear of any truth can be vividly illuminated by drama and which differs from their world view, from those more comfortable looking at the mirror in the bliss of their own ignorance.\r The Bottom Line\u2026\rHarrowingly brutal, powerful and often hard to watch, \u2018Beasts of No Nation\u2019 is war drama at its most uncompromising and tragic, made worse by the fact that it will probably remain timely for generations to come.",

I must admit for the first 20 minutes or so I felt that my fears were to be realised. The story of a young African boy\u2019s training to become a soldier fighting in a civil war contains all the politics and brutality that I was dreading. However, the film is so compelling in the way it draws you into the soldiers\u2019 lives; their rituals, training, day to day survival etc, that one soon becomes transfixed by events however brutal or unsavoury. Ultimately, aside from one very nasty and explicit ritual execution, the violence is not quite as bad as one had feared and it is probably the least amount required within such a brutal context. The eerie music adds its own horrific tone but, amongst all this ugliness the stunningly beautiful cinematography acts like an antidote.\rThe film is confidently realised by director Cary Joji Fukunaga (also the cinematographer) and the editing constantly makes the right cut and keeps the tension ever present. The sound is not always clear, although this is more likely to do with the accents of its cast rather than a technical anomaly. Strangely, at its end, the film leaves you feeling somewhat brutalised even as you conversely feel enriched.",

The story was gripping and emotional, having me on the verge of tears at some points. The brutal reality of the whole thing is conveyed very well and stellar performances by Abraham Attah and Idris Elba make this film something truly special. It's a shame it hasn't garnered as much attention as it deserves, and I'd like to hope Attah or Elba will get some attention during award season.",

However, I also found it to be a bit underwhelming. African children in poverty, suffering, going through hardships, etc has been done too many times and unfortunately I felt like this film didn't really do anything to bring anything new to the table in that sense. On the upside though, I will admit that the film was rather well made. There's great cinematography and imagery throughout. The performances from Idris Elba and newcomer Abraham Attah were also noteworthy and impressive. Overall, I found this to be a rather interesting, powerful, and worthwhile film. Definitely worth a view if you have Netflix. I expect to see this film brought up a lot later during awards season and rightfully so.",

You really feel like you are in a war torn nation when you watch this movie, but I found that movie could\u2019ve benefitted for being more raw. I felt like at times like I was watching a tv movie because I was expecting a movie about child soldiers to be difficult to watch and it really is not. I thought that maybe Netflix really didn\u2019t want to get their hands dirty with their first film. There were a handful of scenes that had some good intensity but in the end I really wasn\u2019t impressed like I had hoped.\r I found that they also spent too much time focusing on Idris Elba\u2019s character rather than the young boy. I do really feel that Elba is a great actor and his performance here is great and he deserves all the attention he gets for this film but I found that he took up too much of the content and because of that I cared less about the young boy in this movie. Elba\u2019s character is really not even that evil and I didn\u2019t hate him at all which is probably what I was supposed to do.\r Beasts of No Nation is not a terrible film and the critics seem to be enjoying it a lot but I just found it to be a disappointment.

Cary Fukunaga brilliantly directed this movie and he's also the same director of the first season of True Detective (Just in case you didn't know). Idris Elba delivers a menacing performance that's one of his best. Abraham Attah stole the show for me, I mean he was so freaking brilliant in this movie and he deserves an Oscar nomination (In my opinion). The movie is shocking and very real with some of the scenes which I liked, because it never hold anything back and not once tried the Hollywood way of getting out of danger. Movies like this are great examples of film making.\r Now for the flaws: I liked this movie, but I honestly can't see myself watching it again. It's one of those movies that you think it's good and well made but never again will you see yourself re-watching it. But that's just me and who knows, you may have watched more than once.\r Overall Beasts of No Nation is a chilling and depressing war drama that really gets to you. The performances, the visuals and the shocking scenes in this movie are unforgettable.",

Beasts of No Nation allows us to see it first hand. Director Cary Fukunaga may be one of the best directors around when it comes to showing us absolutely brutal and incredibly visceral looks at life in war torn regions (Sin Nombre being the other film by him to do this, but in South America). Incredibly powerful, violent, and intense, Beasts of No Nation will undoubtedly go down as one of the best films of 2015. The cinematography is gorgeous, as in all of Fukunaga's work, but the strongest element in the film are the characters. Every character truly elicits an emotional response within you. Their stories, their presence, and their power, all resonate with the viewer. Fukunaga does a great job creating characters we care about in such a mess of destruction and devastation. Through both his direction and writing, we truly get the full impact of their trauma and that makes this one all the more powerful. The acting is also incredible. Abraham Attah turns in one of the best performances from a child actor I have ever seen and Idris Elba is phenomenal. A truly wondrous film, Beasts of No Nation is one of the best films of the year and deserves to be recognised as such.",
