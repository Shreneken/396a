    "critic_reviews": [
        "The tone -- deadpan, wistful, silly but never stupid -- is just right and puts What We Do in the Shadows next to \"This Is Spinal Tap\" as a mockumentary that shows its subjects as human -- in this case, inhuman -- in their hopes and fears.",
        "For a loose-limbed spoof with no real plot, \u201cWhat We Do in the Shadows\u201d is startlingly effective at creating characters we care about, which testifies to the fact that Clement and Waititi have created a world with clear governing laws (albeit ridiculous ones) and never violate those parameters.",
        "There is so much love and understanding of all the genres the film is skewering that What We Do in the Shadows transcends its lowbrow inspirations. It's a real treat.",
        "At a brisk 86 minutes, What We Do in the Shadows never sags or drags, delivering its comic punches with surgical precision and then getting off the stage. Being immortal doesn\u2019t mean you have to lose your sense of timing.",
        "An irrepressibly charming B-movie that never over-stays its welcome, and is both conceptually clever and admirably well-executed.",
        "The film sympathetically renders the small humiliations and inconveniences of life as an old-world vampire struggling with modernity.",
        "What ends up carrying the movie is the sweetness of the characters, especially the lovelorn Viago and Stu (Stu Rutherford), the one human the group won\u2019t eat because he\u2019s genuinely just a good dude.",
        "What We Do in the Shadows has nonmedicinal virtues that many large-scale movies lack: unflagging energy, entertaining inventiveness, sustained ridiculousness and even, dare I say it, a spasm of eloquence in Deacon\u2019s twisted tribute to the frailties of the human race.",
        "Clement and Waititi are intimate with the conventions of vampire movies and reality TV and must have had a crazy-great time blending the unblendable in the best SCTV tradition. But it\u2019s the absence of camp that I keep coming back to. They scale it down and play it real. They\u2019re undeadpan.",
        "What might seem unlikely to endure beyond standard sketch length proves surprisingly resilient in the hands of directors Clement and Waititi, the team responsible for the equally droll \"Flight of the Conchords.\"",
        "This weird and witty spoof filters the routines of the living through the lens of the long dead.",
        "Unless this is an unusually great year for comedy, there will be few funnier or more quotable movies than What We Do In The Shadows.",
        "What We Do in the Shadows is never as self-conscious as you fear it might be, and it has some of the loose, wiggy energy of early Jim Jarmusch, only with more bite. It makes getting poked a pleasure.",
        "Sharp as fangs, warm as fresh blood, this could be the funniest movie of the year. New Zealand\u2019s answer to Edgar Wright.",
        "A very funny Kiwi take on vampire lore and its application to the modern world.",
        "This isn\u2019t much more than a series of ridiculously dotty sketches, and might have worked better as a sitcom, but it\u2019s surprisingly hilarious.",
        "Here it is at long last: a truly great vampire comedy. And also the funniest horror film to come out of New Zealand since Braindead.",
        "A gently parodic tone prevails throughout what is ultimately a pretty sweet take on bloodsuckers, even as Deacon and Nick flap their way through a \u201cbat fight\u201d (exactly what it sounds like) and the vamps face off against a pack of similarly esteem-challenged werewolves led by Conchords manager Rhys Darby.",
        "What We Do in the Shadows is a bracing reminder of how the right burst of energy and style breathes fresh ideas into a genre threatened with creative exhaustion.",
        "The vampires in What We Do in the Shadows are symbolic of something else altogether: epic unkemptness.",
        "\u201cShadows\u201d has its share of lines that will be repeated by fans ad infinitum (a favorite: \u201cYes, now Google it\u201d).",
        "The film\u2019s writers, directors and stars lovingly impale bloodsucker mythology with the sharpened wooden stick of comedy. As with \u201cShaun of the Dead,\u201d their satire is a crude but effective tool.",
        "An inspired and funny vampire comedy, one that\u2019s more than just a smart premise but that remains fun and inventive from beginning to end.",
        "Like a Christopher Guest movie with a widow\u2019s peak, What We Do in the Shadows depicts a supposed \u201cNew Zealand Documentary Board\u201d film gone gruesomely, hilariously awry.",
        "Here's a vampire movie for people who don\u2019t like vampire movies. What We Do in the Shadows is packed with laughs, almost all of them are intentional.",
        "The result is more often amusing than gut-busting, but it doesn\u2019t wear out its welcome, and that\u2019s fairly impressive in itself.",
        "Unlike anything you\u2019ve ever seen before. What the bloodsuckers in this frolic actually do, in or out of the shadows, is make you laugh.",
        "What We Do In the Shadows is the type of little movie that you watch and feel like you've discovered something really special. It's a total surprise; a silly, scary delight.",
        "It was with both joy and mystification, therefore, that I found myself cackling at What We Do in the Shadows like a witch with a helium balloon.",
        "A one-joke comedy about vampires, and yet another mockumentary/fake documentary, a gimmick that has turned seriously stale in recent years.",
        "A dryly amusing mockumentary from the Kiwis behind the similarly deadpan Eagle vs Shark and Flight of the Conchords, What We Do in the Shadows unfolds like the darkest movie that Christopher Guest never made.",
        "Most of the best gags are in the early going and the film seems ever more stretched and thin as it goes on. It would have made a brilliant eight-minute sketch, though.",
        "Some genre fans who prefer the silly to the satiric may bite, but the anemic pic isn\u2019t remotely weird or witty enough for cult immortality."

They came up with great plot elements to flesh out the documentary style into a coherent story that ends on a high note, despite some twists and turns for the characters along the way.  Possibly my favourite aspect of the movie is the offhanded acceptance of the basic premise that the vampires are going to kill to survive, and all the violence and gore that comes with it--everyone, both vampire and human, politely ignores the questionable morals at work, and it makes for a delightfully amoral movie.  I do wonder how many pints of fake blood they went through during production.",

However, it is never really as funny as it thinks it is or should be. Beyond this, it is well done and authentic as a mockumentary, in spite of its absurdist plot. The acting is quite good, even though I was completely unfamiliar with the cast. This fact may have actually helped with the immersion, since I truly believed these people were vampires for the duration of the film. Additionally, the concept is quite good and really interesting. Never drifting into stupid territory as so many vampire flicks do, What We Do in the Shadows effectively covers its classic horror film tropes. However, the film just feels like it is missing something. A crucial piece, I cannot identify what it is, but the film feels slightly incomplete. Regardless, the film is still pretty funny, unique, and compelling, which makes the film more than worth your time.",

What did I see?Well, level of production inferior to some of YouTube videos nowadays, for starters. Everything looks dirt-cheap with laughable effects and poor camera work. I read that the budget was 1.6 million dollars, yet it looks 1.59 million dollars cheaper.But it's not just about the looks, right? It's a comedy, after all, it's the writing that matters! Well unfortunately the jokes here are pure sh*t mostly. It's all dirt-cheap puns about how werewolves act like dogs, so they smell and run after sticks. Or how these guys are vampires, so they can't wear silver necklases as it burns, and they bite people. Oh wow, my belly just hurts so much from all the laughter. There's also some unnecessary vulgarity, which doesn't really help anything.The only reasons this was not a 1/10 are that were like 2 moderately amusing gags, and the whole thing lasts less than an hour and a half, so while it is a tedious bore, it's not as long as it could've been. I heard about this movie after its director and writer Taika Waititi (or whatever) was praised for \"bringing his charm and wit\" to Thor Ragnarok, which I'm yet to watch. Well if Thor Ragnarok has the same level of humor as this than it's likely also f*cking borderline unwatchable trash.After the credits one of the characters says something along the lines of \"You will forget the contents of this movie\".

I would say it is an interview with the vampires in the Kiwi style. The film follows a group of vampires living in an old mansion and their everyday routine, including how they manage to get blood and confrontation with other mutants are documented.\r Definitely a wonderful comedy, but feels like a mix of 'Dark Shadows' and 'Addams Family'. The title implies the nightlife of these creatures, especially adapting the modern way of lifestyle. So their exploration begins here for their video document. Being different is how much struggle is what the film focused. Threats from various quarters and getting over from every disastrous event is revealed.\r Quite an interesting vampire film with the awesome characters and of course the entire film was shot in the dark time. It is not a clich\u00e9, but just a spoof of the typical vampire theme. Cleverly written screenplay and direction with the well supported performances. Looks like many people had loved it, I'm slightly on the different side that I enjoyed watching it but did not like much. Because I have seen better film in the similar concept.

It aces on weaving out a physical comedyfluent vocal finesse..What We Do In The ShadowsWhat We Do In The Shadows is a plot driven comic horror about a documentary set in a New Zealand about a vampire community residing among the society. It aces on weaving out a physical comedy and is performed hilariously too by each cast and is probably the highlight that draws in most of the laughs. It isn't confined with an urge to offer episodes of various gags and sketchy sequences and it also doesn't suggest that it doesn't contain it. It is brimmed with such gullible sequences with sadistic humor and sensitive tiny notions that draws in a chuckle every now and then. Since it is of documentary nature, there exists very little room for technical aspects like background score and cinematography, although is edited well enough and is of shorter runtime too that factors in effectively. Waititi is flat out hilarious with a self-obsessed Clement and emotional Brugh and combining them you'll get the apt bittersweet bonding of a group of friends that contrary to its premise is more humane. The primary reason it works is that it doesn't rely a lot upon its eerie concept, it undeniably is more than its concept, it's frankly quite mature. For amidst all these series of jokes and tactics, it barely focuses upon the difference of the species and creates its own irony within its dark bubble. Waititi's execution is what fuels this fluctuating tale where his key is when he allows the audience to breathe and so to its characters to sink in the awkwardness imputed within the conversations. The narrative is adaptive, gripping and hilarious if not layered or thought provoking but its fluent vocal finesse and verbal sparrings makes it worth the wait. What We Do In The Shadows isn't anything out of the box but what it is, is well aware of it and pulls out the best as an homage to the entire concept.",

Their life is no different from being amish or living some other form of a life. It\u2019s a community of people that as strange and amusing as they are a group of people. With the excellent execution of this form of life a I hope they return and do a spinoff film on the werewolves in the future.",

The premise of following around these bloodsucking roommates all documentary style while they deal with the ins and outs of modern day life is amusing. It's never the funniest movie out there, but the further it progresses the more successful it becomes at mining laughs from the audience. The early material I thought was just a little dry.There are a lot of homages made to creature of the night classics such as Interview with the Vampire and The Lost Boys. Some of the best gags poke fun at vampire lore and their powers. It even branches out to make jokes involving other monsters as well. I feel Waititi gets most of the screen time here. He's a really delightful guy, but I wish we had gotten more material from Clement. His character was the one with the most comedic potential in my opinion and it's him that has the most memorable lines.This was a parody made out of genuine love and enjoyment for the thing being made fun of. With so many quotable one liners it's an entertaining watch, although not necessarily an essential one as it isn't exactly a laugh riot. There's a seemingly huge plot hole that gets addressed during the end credits in the best possible way so be sure to sit through them.",

They assume the very least of their audiences and attempt at humor that is often obvious, crude, and disgusting, if not flat-out vile and, worst of all, unfunny. If it were not for the very properties that these movies blatantly plagiarize for proverbial recognizability, there would be nothing of initial distinction to even consider for viewing. There is no moral, no substance, no logic, no reason whatsoever. If you feel like you're succumbing to the juvenile urge to see a character from the most recent successful horror-entry defecate in ridiculous scenarios, What We Do in the Shadows could prove to be good medicine for your comedic sensibilities.\r Clement and Waititi take a less-cynical, more subtle approach by infusing a ribald silliness with legitimate character detail and situational creativity. What We Do in the Shadows uses the mockumentary format to follow three vampire-stooge flatmates (and one monstrous Nosferatu named 'Peter') living together in an obscure town in modern-day New Zealand. While the majority of the plot is mainly in service of the jokes and plays out pretty melodramatically (albeit mockingly so), the vein of humor (pun unintended) that is tapped into here more than makes up for it's predictability.\r One of the ongoing gags that goes over quite well is the absurd juxtaposition of the archaic lifestyle these vampires lead with the newfangled (pun unintended) environment they live in. The constant, ridiculous decor they don (vests, frilly lace) to their over-the-top accents and a distinct lack of technological or societal awareness results in some pretty hilarious, albeit a bit obvious, results. When the movie gives in to the darker vein of comedy we'd come to expect from a film about amoral bloodsuckers is when it truly strikes gold, however. The preparation for drinking a victim by laying out newspapers, the nonsensical explanation as to why the vampires 'prefer virgins', and the constant devaluing of human life altogether, add up to some deliciously bleak vignettes that gives the film some bite (another awful pun, unintended).\r Stylistically, I feel that Clement and Waititi borrow much in the way of delivery and execution to 2006's 'Borat'. Much like that comedy masterpiece, the characters here spew nonsensical opinions on their world in such a naive, close-minded way that makes their barbaric behavior despicable, yet hilarious, and allows for subtle commentary on morality that doesn't feel entirely shoe-horned in.\r There are plenty of gags that fall flat here, the introduction of another flatmate points the focus of the film unnecessarily on one-note melodrama, and the whole thing begins to feel a bit stale after about the 50-minute mark. Otherwise, What We Do in the Shadows is a thankfully brief, hilariously dark horror-comedy that is a definite recommendation for fans of both. It has fantastic replay value and quotability, and I dare say it's one of the best vampire films to come out in the '10s, period.",
