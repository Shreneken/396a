  "summary": "A feisty widowed single mom finds herself burdened with the full-time custody of her rambunctious \r15-year-old ADHD son. As they try to make ends meet, Kyla, the peculiar girl across the street, offers her help. Together, they find a new sense of balance, and hope is regained.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "There’s so much that is brilliant and unexpected and often downright thrilling about Mommy, the fifth feature (a fact amazing in itself) from 25-year-old Quebec enfant terrible Xavier Dolan.",
    "It taps into every parent's worst nightmare — the horror of being unable to protect an out-of-control child.",
    "Dolan is a director who thinks hard about the possibilities of cinema and explores them with verve and ingenuity, but it is in his latest film that everything has come together.",
    "There are ups and downs and soapish highs and lows, but what stops this from ever becoming a telenovela is the riveting wonder of the performances and the sheer brio of the filmmaking.",
    "Mommy is first and foremost a mother-and-son story, but it's also a surprisingly delicate exploration of lonely lives, and the temporary islands of companionship that make them bearable.",
    "It’s uncanny how much Dolan’s style and overall solipsism have evolved in five years’ time, resulting in a funny, heartbreaking and, above all, original work — right down to its unusual 1:1 aspect ratio — that feels derivative of no one, not even himself.",
    "The movie is a furious, in-your-face whirlwind of emotions, but it’s never tiresome or bellicose, and its raucous, messy energy is invigorating.",
    "Here's the thing about Mommy: Even when Dolan gets self-indulgent and works his themes into the ground, he's a one-man fireworks display. His images jump off the screen and stick in your head.",
    "As a director, he finally shows a willingness to work on the same wavelength of the material instead of adding distracting bells and whistles that overstate his characters' grievances.",
    "Dolan has previously been accused of style over substance but here he draws both magnificently together. It’s perhaps a little too long, but Mommy is a movie to make you feel alive.",
    "Exhilarating and exhausting in equal measure – a decent approximation of how the characters feel – Mommy puts us through every setting on the emotional wringer.",
    "Mommy is a film as harrowing as it is exhilarating, a story sometimes hard to watch but impossible to turn away from.",
    "Boasting dynamite performances, Mommy excels as a confrontational, compassionate melodrama about the anguishing dilemmas of caretaking. It’s a revelation.",
    "With Dolan, you feel you're in the company of a truly original voice and one unafraid to make his mistakes right up there on the screen.",
    "Dolan's energy and attack is thrilling; his movie is often brilliant and very funny in ways which smash through the barriers marked Incorrect and Inappropriate.",
    "Dolan's fifth feature feels like a strong step forward, striking his most considered balance yet between style and substance, drama-queen posturing and real heartfelt depth.",
    "Mommy is too long for its own good, its sense of hysteria too relentless. But the headlong energy is intoxicating more than exhausting, and Freud would have a field day with Die and Steve. A mother and child, so sweet, so tender, so terrifying.",
    "It feels like living inside a pressure cooker with one particular family — experiencing their turbulence as if from the inside, while always a little glad to be watching from a safe distance.",
    "See it; see those three performers go to town.",
    "The volatile, unbridled emotion of Mommy — its sheer life force — makes up for its structural weaknesses, giving viewers an often breathtaking glimpse of a director who, like his own adamantly unconventional protagonists, is fairly bursting at the seams with spiky, headstrong brio.",
    "In French with English subtitles, is a showcase for Anne Dorval in the title role. Over the course of this overlong melodrama she wins our understanding and occasionally our sympathy as she struggles to get and keep a job, find a man and keep her maddening, monster of a son (Antoine-Olivier Pilon) under control.",
    "Mommy is certainly a showcase for powerful acting: Anne Dorval is the coarse but affecting Diane, Antoine-Olivier Pilon is terrifying as Diane’s teenage son, Steve.",
    "In its garishness, Mommy is a weirdly compelling overreach for this young filmmaker. It's the work of someone clearly passionate, if not disciplined yet, about his cinematic interests.",
    "To take Mommy as an undisciplined outpouring of aggression and angst is to underestimate its artistry. [Mr. Dolan] has both advanced beyond the romanticism of “Heartbeats” and “Laurence Anyways” and regressed toward a more primal and confrontational mode of storytelling. Mommy may seem out of control, but it knows exactly what it’s doing.",
    "If it merits no other superlative, Mommy is unquestionably the most hyperactive movie of the year. It begins at a fever pitch and maintains that degree of in-your-face intensity for well over two hours, to either exhilarating or exhausting effect, depending on one’s tolerance level.",
    "If Mommy counts as a slight creative step back, and I would argue that it is, it's at least an elegant and purposeful one.",
    "The three lead performances cut through Dolan’s showier tendencies, creating relatable, empathetic characters; we share in their glimmer of optimism for a better future, making it all the more painful when reality comes crashing down.",
    "Dolan embraces passion and melodrama to a refreshing degree, and Dorval and Clément are terrific. But Mommy can be exhausting; the structure and plot rhythms are all over everywhere. A montage to “Wonderwall” (every last note of it) seems to sum up the movie; too much, but exhilarating all the same.",
    "When Xavier Dolan's tremendous empathy for the abandoned, medicated, and economically stressed is given full visual flight, it's easy to get lost in the rush.",
    "Mommy puts all its personal baggage on the table like Ally Sheedy emptying her purse in The Breakfast Club, and Dolan is to be admired for sharing so much of himself, and doing it with such evident passion. But it isn’t enough for an artist simply to share—he has to shape, too.",
    "It comes at you baying and rattling like an early Pedro Almodóvar comedy, threaded through with an infectious love of full-throttle melodrama, and flinging its energy right back to the cheap seats, thanks to Dolan's customarily zippy design choices.",
    "I suppose the relationship is Oedipal or primal or something or other, but mostly it’s just an excuse for Dolan to stage a series of gaudy shout-fests.",
    "Mommy bursts with so much frenzied, turbulent energy that it really only makes sense when looked at as the fifth feature film by a 25-year-old moviemaker. Québécois Xavier Dolan is one of those enfants terribles of the cinema, making and sometimes acting in films that court attention.",
    "Willfully over determined and perversely stylized."

Despite subject matter that could have been either downbeat or depressing the film manages toAn exhilaratingly original, exciting and audacious work from director Xavier Dolan that holds one spellbound for every one of its 139 minutes. Despite subject matter that could have been either downbeat or depressing the film manages to project both hope and humour in its telling of the relationships between three damaged individuals. Dolan’s skill as a visionary director is on display constantly and his bravura use of the camera is imaginative. This includes the unusual decision to film in the 1:1 ratio as if to reflect the restricted lives under the spotlight. Simple shots and a blend of techniques are equally breath taking to behold and have maximum impact within the context of both the scene and the story as a whole. Dolan is also very well served by his three principle actors who deliver sublimely knock out performances. Anne Dorval as the thick skinned but tackily dressed mother of a violent and uncontrollable son, is a gutsy and loud presence that can’t be ignored. Suzanne Clement, on the other hand, subtly shows us the layers of a withdrawn wife and mother who’s stuttering only begins to subside when around these two larger than life individuals. As the son, Antoine Olivier Pilon is one moment tender and loving and in the next dangerously out of control. All three performances are outstanding and complement each other beautifully.\rTechnically the film is also great. The editing is seamless and impressively clever. The sound is good and the use of music to accompany the visuals is cannily inspired. Wow! This is really not to be missed.",

It's a dramatic film, which was released last october. This film is Canadian with English dialogues.\r As the film shows, the story is about a relationship between a mother and a 17 year old who has behaviour problems.\r According to me, this film should be seen because it gives an understanding of lots of things in terms of strange behaviours that a human can have. It gives a huge amount of emotions, which is the most important thing, especially in cinema. This film is beautiful, and transports us in different kinds of sensations. We are often in empathy with the charaters, wa want to follow them as far as are can in their story.\r The framing of the film in very important at some moments, we see that the director has taken great care of the filming ans the scenes full of feelings. The actors play a crucial rôle to transmit this impact.\r There is a moral that can differ according te the spectator, thanks to the stressfull end. Go and see to understand !",

The mother, Diane, nicknames Die and played by Anne Dorval, has been a  widow for 3 years and the son, Steve, played by Antoine Olivier Pilon, hasn’t accepted his father’s death and had been previously diagnosed with ADD and/or possibly also being bi-polar. They are both capable of moods swinging form high highs to low lows. One moment he can be choking her and the next moment kissing her on the lips while she can be as tender with him as any mother can be and in the next moment bashing him over the head with a framed picture.\r Both the mother and son lean on their neighbor across the street who lives there with her boyfriend? Husband? And their young daughter. She, Kyla, played by Suzanne Clement, had been a high school teacher but due to something--a nervous breakdown?--has stopped teaching and she can barely talk in full sentences and stutters horribly except around the mother and son.\r Both mother and son are foul mouth speakers along with being flirtatious whenever the opportunity arises or, sometimes, instigating sexual innuendos. The language, in some instances, is definitely R rated.\r It is a good straight told story of a subject that isn’t often a theme for movies, mainly in the first half but then the director/screenwriter/editor enters the picture. I want to excuse him because he is 25 years old but this is his fifth picture so he should know better. The film is mostly in a 1 to 1 ratio so most of the time you feel as if you are looking at it on a large cell phone. The screen is widen a few times but only effective and noticeable the first time. There are one too many blurry collages not too mention choppy editing that I guess is suppose to be ’artistic’. Also the screenwriter leaves way too many questions unanswered that are an important part of the story.\r Anne Dorval, Suzanne Clement and Antoine Olivier Pilon give excellent performances, especially the latter who has to handle showing all sides of a teenager with mental illness that changes him constantly.\r Aside from running far too long--two hours and 20 minutes--I felt frustration at how Dolan was taking a good story line and getting excessive with the camera. I found myself going from being interested to being bored and back and forth all during the movie and, finally, leaving annoyed.",

Well I got something to learn next time.\r The story is about a single mom's dramaYou know what sucks? I already did my top movies of 2014 list, now if I only watched this movie before making the list this would have made the list easily. Well I got something to learn next time.\r The story is about a single mom's drama about raising her son, who's behavior deteriorates into violence, due to a mild mental illness.\r I first took interest in the film Mommy just because of the hype and the positive praise it got from the 2014 Cannes Film Festival and the amount of awards it won from the Jutra Awards and Canadian Screen Awards for best Foreign Language film, but not a Academy Award for Foreign Film at the Oscars. Since I am watching more Foreign Language films and searching the ones that got high ratings or just the ones that may interest me, because I'm taking a break from some movies today as they normally not very good or just too Hollywood for me, I mean movies today are getting pretty stale and cliche as nothing feels originally anymore. When Hollywood tries to make a original movie that's down to earth it's laughable. These something about Foreign Language films that always feel real and sometimes so tight with it's story and ending that most movie studios will shy away from and I love it. So I checked out the 2014 Award Wining Mommy and it was absolutely brilliant, I mean how could I even dear overlook this I mean this is a great movie right here and true film making at it's best.\r Not only did the Oscar screw up for not awarding this for Best Foreign Language film, they also didn't nominate Anne Dorval for Best Actress, because she did one of the best, the most heart felt and the most real piece of performance I've seen in 2014. I felt her struggle and the mix relationship between her and the missed behaved son. There was many scenes in the movie were the son and her have this argument over each over and it never felt like I was just watching actors reading out the script and pretending that they related, no they back and forward arguments always felt real and I bough it. Oh and I found out most of the awards that this movie won are not just for the Foreign Language Award but most of the awards went to her and she deserves it and a Oscar too for god shake. At the Cannes Film Festival Julianne Moore won for Best Actress for Maps to the Stars and I haven't seen Maps to the Stars yet so I can't really judge on her performance in that movie since I haven't seen it, but Anne Dorval was nominated in that category so it was disappointing that she didn't take the award, but I have seen Still Alice and she won a Oscar for that role, but Anne Dorval should have took that Oscar home as she did a much better than Moore as I connected to Anne Dorval more and how her performance made me feel different emotions that I never felt before while watching the movie.\r Antoine-Olivier Pilon is a unknown star to me as I haven't seen him in any other movies before so this is basically the first ever performance I get to see him in and man god can this kid act, I mean he was so good in the movie. Just like I said about Anne Dorval and that is all the time it never felt like acting to me, it felt real. Antoine plays the misbehaved son perfectly that he actually catches the trouble child very well since I have seen young people like him in real life and how they act is just like him. I also love how they never force the message of \"He's got a mental illness oh feel sorry for him\". The movie never puts that in your face like most movies do when they try to be realistic or make you feel something for the character. He's performance showed both angry, goofy, troubled and damaged but all that is in he's performance and it never feels force and that was so well done that movie didn't slip into that cliche that happens in most movies and that's due to Antoine-Olivier Pilon excellent performance.\r The director of the movie Xavier Dolan which I haven't really seen any of his last work so this is my first movie directed by him and a great start. This is film making at it's best, I mean the cinematography is beautiful, the tone of the movie can switch to serious drama but quickly change to happy and many other tones and it didn't ruin the movie like most do. Xavier Dolan did both a excellent job on directing the movie and making this as down to earth as possible showing characters and they problems that most people can relate to. Awesome work Xavier Dolan.\r For problems with the movie I haven't really got any to be honest, but I'm not going to give this the perfect rating as I think this isn't on the level of 5/5 rating it can ever get it, but the rating I'm giving it is really outstanding and it's the highest rating I give this week.\r Overall I say that Mommy is worth checking it if you haven't seen it yet. It's worth your time and don't do the same mistake as I did and not watch this fantastic movie.",

But I really liked the dream sequence. Editing was mostly mediocre though. I don’t really like how all men are coded in an exclusively negative way. The lawyer just wants sex from Die, Kyla’s husband’s job is more important than what Kyla wants and she has just to follow him, Steve is just destroying everyone's lives. It seems like in this film men are only holding back and negatively affecting women. Like that’s all they do. And Steve is portrayed just as a straight up menace. His depiction is very shallow, we don't see any of his inner world and I don’t think his character is based on realistic psychology of a human being. But mom/son relationship dynamics do seem realistic. I noticed how everyone is telling the truth when they are drunk. Rather a simplistic take on alcohol from the director. Why can’t everyone stop being fake and face the truth when they’re sober? Ultimately that's what killed Steve when Die chose to believe in some fake ‘hope’. Or maybe that's just how she justified her actions. Either way the outcome is the same. I think the director didn’t have a clear vision of what type of movie he was making. It looks very formal with a huge accent on aesthetics and a huge amount of beautiful cheesy scenes and shots that are very technical (like slow-mo, tracking shots). But the narrative is realistic. It’s the opposite of the visual. Last note, hearing Dido and Lana Del Rey (Born To Die. I **** you not) made me cringe a bit. It was like a cherry on top of those cheesy cliché scenes.",
