  "critic_reviews": [
    "As a rich and exuberant character-driven crime saga in an idiom you absolutely have not encountered before, and a dense, unsentimental portrayal of the collision between democracy, capitalism and gangsterism on the frayed margins of the post-colonial world, Gangs of Wasseypur is a signal achievement in 21st-century cinema.",
    "An extraordinary ride through Bollywood’s spectacular, over-the-top filmmaking, Gangs of Wasseypur puts Tarantino in a corner with its cool command of cinematically-inspired and referenced violence, ironic characters and breathless pace.",
    "The love child of Bollywood and Hollywood, Gangs of Wasseypur is a brilliant collage of genres, by turns pulverizing and poetic in its depiction of violence.",
    "This insane masterpiece shows the self-destructive properties of myth making and how they overlap with the downfall of a community damned from the beginning of time.",
    "There’s no doubt that Gangs of Wasseypur is an exhilarating creation, a not-to-be-missed cinematic event, and a work as sprawling, messy, and open-ended as real life.",
    "Impressively, Gangs of Wasseypur manages its sprawling story lines deftly and maintains a brisk pace throughout its daunting length. The performances are uniformly excellent, even if no character in Part 1 is at all likable.",
    "The storytelling is brisk, though the wealth of events and characters means you have to let yourself go with the flow. But Gangs of Wasseypur is always compelling, and Bajpai’s charisma means there’s always a colorful presence at the heart of the drama long after the endless hail of bullets has grown tiresome.",
    "Slightly overlong and convoluted at times, it presents compelling, sexy characters spouting sharp, believable dialogue.",
    "Although the narrative contains echoes of “The Godfather” and “The Godfather Part II” — and perhaps “Casino,” in that much of it is structured as a flashback from an assassination attempt — “Gangs” lacks the poetry and character interest of those films.",
    "The killing is bloody, the power struggles involving, the history-class examinations of the relations between mines and unions and gangsters fascinating, and the tough-guy routines, while sometimes tiresome, never less than credible."

It is more like an indian version of 'city of god'. Even the romantic scenes  worked well makes the movie more charming with casual dialogues. It has delivered a violent packed story with a bold screenplay like never in Bollywood.",

      "content": "I didn't know who Anurag Kashyap was before I saw this film. And my mind was blown. This is the best gangster movie Bollywood has ever made, and that's saying something since Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai also exists.When the film begins, itI didn't know who Anurag Kashyap was before I saw this film. And my mind was blown. This is the best gangster movie Bollywood has ever made, and that's saying something since Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai also exists.When the film begins, it seems like it will be the same old, generic good guy vs bad guy movie. But as the story progresses, the line between the good and bad people blurs to the point where it doesn't exist anymore. In the beginning it feels like Sardar Khan is supposed to be the hero, but slowly he's shown to be a terrible person who gets in fights with everyone and marries a second time just because he's getting horny.Nawazuddin Siddiqui's Faisal is introduced in the second part after the demise of Sardar Khan. The bad guys really make you feel like killing them, and the way they speak is very reminiscent of the villages from Bihar and east UP. The acting by literally everyone is phenomenal, such that it inspired memes for years to come, and that's being in a good way. Every scene has been choreographed so well it actually gives you the feeling of those poor, low class families from suburban areas.It doesn't matter how many web series come up - Mirzapur, Paatal Lok, Sacred Games. The fact remains that Gangs of Wasseypur is the OG that started it all, and no one can ever replace its legacy.",

But the only player playing is Anurag Kashyap. There’s plethora of pieces at his disposal fueled only by his creativity and his knowledge. A shocking set of checks, gambits and blunders carry the movie and leave the audience on the edge of their seat throughout. Enough with the chess though. Raw brilliance with the camera and lighting and powerful music carry the movie for me. Even otherwise, this story would be a bestseller should it have been a book because the dialogue and the twists are brilliant enough. Finally, the acting. **** Nawazuddin Siddiqui and motherfuking Manoj Bajpayee are such brilliant performers that you can’t take your eyes off of them. Truly is a brilliant film. Even if you don’t speak Hindi or aren’t proficient at it, you need to watch this movie before you die.",
