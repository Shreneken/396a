  "critic_reviews": [
    "Kramer vs. Kramer is a movie of good performances, and it had to be, because the performances can't rest on conventional melodrama.",
    "Kramer vs. Kramer is, essentially, a television movie that was raised into the feature category by the excellence of the execution.",
    "Kramer vs. Kramer is densely packed with such beautifully observed detail. It is also superbly acted by its supporting cast, including Jane Alexander, Howard Duff and George Coe.",
    "Kramer vs. Kramer is a rare movie that finds its tone, its focus and its poetry in its very first image.",
    "Kramer vs. Kramer is a perceptive, touching, intelligent film about one of the raw sores of contemporary America, the dissolution of the family unit.",
    "Even when its emotions run a bit out of control, Kramer vs. Kramer is a strong and positive film. Its performances are first-rate, from Hoffman and streep down to Howard Duff (as a divorce lawyer) and a terrifically talented lad named Justin Henry, who visibly matures in his portrayal of Billy, the contested kid.",
    "This looks, in retrospect, like nothing much more than a glossy soap passed off as serious drama.",
    "Misogynistic claptrap about a divorced husband (Dustin Hoffman) fighting for the custody of and learning to cope with his little boy (Justin Henry) - a movie whose classy trimmings (including Nestor Almendros's cinematography) persuaded audiences to regard writer-director Robert Benton as a subtle art-house director."

      "content": "Released in 1979 when female nudity was still allowed in PG-rated films, Kramer vs. Kramer is still as powerful now as it was then, even if the film is now 38 years old. About a couple - Ted (Dustin Hoffman) and Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) -Released in 1979 when female nudity was still allowed in PG-rated films, Kramer vs. Kramer is still as powerful now as it was then, even if the film is now 38 years old. About a couple - Ted (Dustin Hoffman) and Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) - who separate, divorce, and are now fighting a custody battle, the film is achingly real. Blessed with an authentic and heartbreaking script from Robert Benton, Kramer vs Kramer never ceases to both break your heart and be an absolutely riveting film. Praised for portraying the concerns of both Ted and Joanna evenly, Kramer vs Kramer may paint Joanna as a bad guy in the film, but her concerns are valid ones with regard to her marriage to Ted.Ted, a workaholic, is a distant father. He provides financially, but misses the crucial part: emotion and low. His son Billy (Justin Henry) barely knows him. Joanna is done. She has been unhappy and forced to be a stay-at-home mom against her wishes, so she leaves. Ted is neglectful and old school with a set understanding of what a wife should be and do. This does not work for Joanna, so she leaves him and Billy to find herself and happiness. For the next 18 months, Ted and Billy fight and are forced to learn to live and love one another, while Ted is forced to parent. The end result is an unbreakable bond that Ted could never imagine having severed in the future. As such, he gets quite defensive when Joanna comes back with a job and wants to take her son back full-time. This is where Kramer vs Kramer fails to be fair, as it shows Ted and Billy for the most part. When Joanna gets Billy briefly for a visit, we only see how Ted handles giving him over. As such, we write off Joanna as a parent and start rooting for Ted to get the kid, even though this **** wants to take Billy away from him. That said, for his part, Hoffman has incredible chemistry with the young Justin Henry. Hoffman plays an incredibly sympathetic man with great gravitas and care for the nuance of parenthood. He refuses to demonize Joanna and instead begins to look inward and identify what made her run away. He knows he screwed up and feels great remorse for those errors.On the flip side, Meryl Streep is impeccable. Her testimony is raw, powerful, and engrossing. Her delivery is always top-notch and it is hard to deny that this is a performance worthy of her first Oscar. She is limited in screen time compared to Hoffman, but she makes an impact every time she appears on the screen. As Joanna, she plays this forward-thinking mother who looks beyond the home for gratification and success. As such, a home life is at odds with what she truly wants. Though she loves Billy, having him live with her would be a mistake for the both of them, even if she is a good mother. Her realization of this is an incredibly powerful moment in the film and underscores Joanna's confusion and lack of focus in her life at the moment.Impeccably written, as mentioned, the film's main fault is that it takes Ted's side. We understand Joanna, but never comprehend why she wants to take Billy away. Why must Ted be limited to every other weekend and she gets the kid? The film too readily cops out and blames archaic beliefs of the judge that mothers are more important when, in reality, it must explain why Joanna refuses joint custody and wants Billy full-time. The two could split him and the end result would be hard, but easy to understand. Yet, they go guns blazing at one another because Joanna wanted to. This is unfortunate and makes her hard to sympathize with, even if her reason for divorcing Ted makes sense.A powerful film, Kramer vs. Kramer is a riveting and thoroughly engrossing family drama that has authenticity in every line. Hoffman and Streep turns in powerful performances as the warring couple, even if the writing seems to take Hoffman's side a bit too much. That said, it is an incredibly nuanced and timeless film that rides on the back of its impeccable characters, real life drama, and acting.",

Whoever is married, let him say it for you! And there are no easy divorces. There are always moments of accusations, acid exchanges, traumatic legal struggles, and children are often the most affected. This incredible film is about that.Ted and Joanna Kramer were just another couple in an agonizing crisis: with work increasingly demanding, Ted was no longer able to pay attention to his wife's emotional needs, and the emotional divide between them became insurmountable. She packs her bags, walks out the door. He leaves everything behind, including his own son. Ted will have to change his life and learn to be a mother and father, knowing in advance that he will not get the same time and reasoning available to work at 110% as he did before. And the ghost of a legal battle for the custody of the child will always be a sword of Damocles on him.The film is really good, it approaches the problem with a rare elegance and we can actually follow the changes in the routine and in the behavior of that father and that son, as they adapt. The script was wonderfully constructed and the emotional bond that we are establishing with the characters is fast and solid. At times, I felt that the film sided with the father on many issues, and that the maternal figure was almost condemned by the end of the marriage. On the other hand, the film raises very serious and pertinent questions as to how the courts, often relatively informally, tend to favor the mother's side in custody disputes. I think the way in which Ted Kramer exposes himself in the scene where he is asked about it in court is a real libel for defending a father's ability to be considered as good as any mother to raise her child. It's a joke, thirty, almost forty years after the film was made, and men are still a long way from earning the right to better prospects in a legal dispute over a child.The actors did an excellent job. The film has a relatively small cast, and everything revolves around the family in disintegration. Dustin Hoffman is an excellent protagonist and really deserves to be acclaimed for his interpretation which, moreover. Beside her, equally grandiose, Meryl Streep manages to save her character who, in the hands of an actress without her talent and ability, would become a simple villain empty of content ... the only thing that may have hindered her is to have really little time in the film. Justin Henry, who gave life to the couple's young son, also knew how to work very seriously in his role and the way he did it was truly worthwhile, considering his age. Finally, a word of appreciation and praise for the work of Jane Alexander, in the role of the neighbor and best friend of the couple.Not being the type of film where technical details stand out, it maintained a regularity that accentuated its elegance. Cinematography contributed decisively to this by using colors and light well, and maintaining a generally neutral contrast (in some scenes this was purposely altered). The sets and costumes are also very good, and I personally would like to highlight the way the decoration of the house changes over time: the maternal figure disappears, the “feminine touch” too, things become more practical. Finally, a note of praise that seems fair and important to the soundtrack, built on a solid foundation of melodies by Vivaldi and Purcell, two giants of Baroque music. As a confessed and incorrigible music lover, I was delighted to appreciate this soundtrack.",

That's for the most part because the movie refused to take sides, but in a very remarkable way. Simply, the movie seems as if it had shied away from interfering with the Kramers' divorce subject, and therefore let its characters to compete with each other on making viewer biased towards him/her. And that's exactly what made the main characters flesh out, of course besides the fact that they are played by Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep.Both Dustin Hoffman (one of my favorite actors of all-time), and Meryl Streep (one of, if not the best actress of all-time) gave unbelievably authentic performances that could be the best performances of their respected careers. They definitely deserved their Oscars!The only issue I have with Robert Benton's masterpiece that I could have easily ignored is that I found the interrogation part of the courtroom scene was a bit tad monotonous only because I became totally torn between both Ted and Joanna because the baffling honesty of their justifications. I know that sounds more like a good thing, but I got tired at the end of the sequence of the constant rejections of the defense lawyers. So maybe the sequence could have been a bit shorter as we became aware how it would end.Kramer vs. Kramer is easily the most sensitive, absorbing, and heartbreaking movie I've seen of its kind. In part because the exceptional cast, but largely because Robert Benton's significant adapted screenplay that is as simple as it's profound, and indisputably because of his tangible and nuanced direction.(9.5/10)",

Boy was I wrong. Yes, the film develops its sense of humour, beautifully I might add, but it's first and foremost a serious drama about evolving gender roles, mental health, love, jobs and parenthood.The Vivaldi music is perfectly placed and utilised, the film encompasses so many little character quirks and small moments without being unfilmic. It manages to have an intimate male/female relationship without it ever looking like it will blossom in to cliche romantic love and there's no question that Streep and Hoffman won't get back together which focus the movie. Despite the film's theatricality and ancientnesss, it's still a relevant film today I feel in many ways. Today it would be made to show a more female POV (and perhaps it should) but at the time I think it very much set out to show other Men that Men could have the same hearts.",
