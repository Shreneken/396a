    "critic_reviews": [
        "It's a movie based on an idea, and all the conventional wisdom agrees that emotions, not ideas, are the best to make movies from. But Being There pulls off its long shot and is one of the most confoundingly provocative movies of the year.",
        "Hal Ashby's direction is perfect in realizing the offbeat humor and gentle satire of the piece.",
        "Jerzy Kosinski's modern fable gets a terrific translation to the screen due to his tight screenplay, capable direction by Ashby, and a marvelous performance by Sellers, one unlike any other in his career.",
        "Being There finds humor in the way Sellers becomes a blank screen on which people project their expectations. But it also finds value in his simplicity, which might seem like a lot of New Age hokum if not for Sellers' disarmingly quiet performance.",
        "Being There is a highly unusual and an unusually fine film. A faithful but nonetheless imaginative adaptation of Jerzy Kosinski's quirky comic novel, pic marks a significant achievement for director Hal Ashby and represents Peter Sellers' most smashing work since the mid-1960s.",
        "A delightfully dark comedy that, despite a cynical bent, offers viewers a good time.",
        "Elegiac and yet ruefully funny, Hal Ashby\u2019s Being There is at once a profoundly philosophical fable about how we become truly human only in the face of our ineluctable mortality, as well as an incensed satire intent on skewering the mass media\u2019s unhealthy sway among the corridors of wealth and power.",
        "A placid, poignant, well-kept secret of a movie.",
        "Here is a comedy that valiantly defies both gravity and the latest Hollywood fashion.",
        "Hal Ashby directs Being There at an unruffled, elegant pace, the better to let Mr. Sellers's double-edged mannerisms make their full impression upon the audience.",
        "You can see the movie\u2019s influence on everything from Forrest Gump to Idiocracy to Elf, all comedies with oblivious, world-changing simpletons at their center.",
        "The director, Hal Ashby, has affected a restrained, understated style to match the subtlety and precision of Sellers's performance. No one seems to know what to do with the allegorical undertone of Jerzy Kosinski's script, but as a whole this 1979 film maintains a fine level of wit, sophistication, and insight.",
        "Sellers's performance\u2014as the innocent neuter figure who rises accidentally to political power on the strength of vacant homilies\u2014is remarkable. But Ashby's direction is marred by the same softness that made The Last Detail and Coming Home so morally bland."

Using theEasily the crown jewel in the many-ornamented crown that is Peter Sellers' career, Hal Ashby's \"Being There\" is one of those incredibly subtle acts of ironical dance-work that honestly puts a lot into perspective for you the viewer. Using the film's severely psychologically disabled protagonist as both a means to confirm and challenge the eccentricities of the American public, it's almost as if this movie is supposed to act as a blistering hot satire, a tender and sensitive drama, and a thematically enriching Rorschach test all in one. It's honestly one of those movies that's too intricate and sophisticated to try and break down. So check it out for yourself. There'll surely be something about the film you won't regret witnessing.",

Its a comedy of sorts - definitely a very dry comedy, not a visual, big belly laugh type of a comedy but I enjoyed it for being something a little different. Sellers does well portraying a slightly confused  and unsure person, someone is just...well, being there, although he is also seemingly quite knowledgable, someone who it appears knows more than perhaps he realises himself. The plot is, I think its fair to say, somewhat hard to believe but I found it amusing in terms of knowing more, as a viewer, of Chance's situation as depicted at the start of the film, so seeing people misinterpret him was certainly amusing. There is a definite element of social awkwardness present, often in relation to the upper social classes, which I found amusing. I liked this film and I'd recommend it to others, as something a little different. It has a surreal feel about it. I'd also say its a relatively memorable film as well.",
