    "critic_reviews": [
        "Savagely witty on backstage life and audaciously edited, Jazz stands alongside Cabaret as the best \u0093musical\u0094 of the last 20 years.",
        "Fosse spins his runaway narcissism into self-effacing humor and filters the darkest themes through electrifying song-and-dance numbers. The musical sequences are a lesson in choreography, not just for Fosse's renowned wit and invention in handling his dancers, but also in the editing, which fuses music and movement in perfectly timed cuts.",
        "All That Jazz is one of the most self-indulgent movies ever made\u2014but blessedly so.",
        "All That Jazz may be Fosse\u2019s finest cinematic achievement.",
        "An uproarious display of brilliance, nerve, dance, maudlin confessions, inside jokes and, especially, ego.",
        "Bob Fosse\u2019s half-confession about what a jerk he was to the women in his life may pull a lot of punches, but there\u2019s just too much art on the screen to completely disregard the effort.",
        "All That Jazz is a self-important, egomaniacal, wonderfully choreographed, often compelling film which portrays the energetic life, and preoccupation with death, of a director-choreographer who ultimately suffers a heart attack.",
        "All That Jazz is great-looking but not easy to watch; Fosse's indulgent vision at times approaches sour self-loathing, and nothing like the explicit open-heart surgery had been seen on mainstream American screens, let alone the morbid song-and-dance routines in an operating theater.",
        "Though Scheider is a wry, sensitive actor, he soon gets lost in the vulgar theatrics. So does the subject of death. When Fosse attempts to put his heart on the table, he does so too literally.",
        "By the time the film is over, the movie has degenerated with a jaundiced vengeance. Fosse's sour, grandstanding cynicism imposed an intolerable burden of self-pity on his talent, our compassion and the tradition of the backstage muscial.",
        "Almost every scene is excruciating (and a few are appalling), yet the film stirs an obscene fascination with its rapid, speed-freak cutting and passionate psychological striptease. This is the feverish, painful expression of a man who lives in mortal fear of his own mediocrity.",
        "The jokes are relentlessly crass and objectionable; the song'n'dance routines have been created in the cutting-room and have lost any sense of fun; Fellini-esque moments add little but pretension; and scenes of a real open-heart operation, alternating with footage of a symbolic Angel of Death in veil and white gloves, fail even in terms of the surreal."

Watching it again today, I am struck by the vile nature of the Fosse surrogate, played by Roy Scheider. The scene that most evokes this response is one following a night of sex with a dancer named Victoria.The rehearsal hall is awash in dancers and Victoria is being put through her paces by her choreographre-lover - he humiliates her, berates her, drives her to tears and then he takes her aside to say he can't make her a great dancer, but he hopes and wants to make her a good enough dancer. He has that power, of course, to make or break - and Victoria, speaking through her sobs, smiles at hime as he pats her head and the assembled company of artists, who have been witness to this assault, applaud the victory. In 1979 this was icky, and in 2021 it is downright sick-making.",
