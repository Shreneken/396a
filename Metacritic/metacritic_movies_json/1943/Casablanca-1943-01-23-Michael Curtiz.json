  "title": "Casablanca",
  "rating": 8.8,

  "summary": "A Casablanca, Morocco casino owner in 1941 shelters his former lover and her husband, a Czechoslovakian freedom fighter, from the Nazis.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The dialogue is so spare and cynical it has not grown old-fashioned. Much of the emotional effect of Casablanca is achieved by indirection; as we leave the theater, we are absolutely convinced that the only thing keeping the world from going crazy is that the problems of three little people do after all amount to more than a hill of beans.",
    "Much more fun than its stuffy \"Greatest Film Ever Made\" tag suggests, with a literate script, stylish direction, a great song and cinema's most romantic couple in Bogie and Bergman.",
    "Casablanca accomplishes that which only a truly great film can: enveloping the viewer in the story, forging an unbreakable link with the characters, and only letting go with the end credits.",
    "The film has a peculiar magic to it, and because of its pace the richness of its sense of detail often goes unnoticed.",
    "Seventy years on, this great romantic noir is still grippingly powerful: a movie made at a time when it was far from clear the Nazis were going to lose.",
    "Despite the fact that the fortunate turn or military events has removed the city of Casablanca, in French Morocco, from the Vichyfrance sphere and has thus in one respect dated the film, the combination of fine performances, engrossing story and neat direction make that easily forgotten. Film should be a solid moneymaker everywhere.",
    "The most familiar movie in the world is still fresh; it has so many little busy corners to nestle in... Casablanca is the most sociable, the most companionable film ever made. Life as an endless party.",
    "There are some of the very finest character actors that Warner Brothers could muster and a rich, detailed screenplay studded with an indecent number of sparklingly quotable lines. It is a movie to play again, and again.",
    "Casablanca was filmed in the safety of the Warner Bros. lot, but the cast of immigrants and exiles who had fled the Third Reich conveyed their visceral fear. While the future was uncertain, the resolute characters of this exquisite wartime drama found peace through love and resistance.",
    "Here is a drama that lifts you right out of your seat.",
    "Nobody ever gathered together a sharper, more pungent international \"Golden Age\" cast (including Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Paul Henreid, Conrad Veidt, S.Z. Sakall, Marcel Dalio, Leonid Kinskey, John Qualen and Curt Bois) in a more imperishable exotic movieland cabaret (Rick's) than Warner Bros. producer Hal Wallis and director Michael Curtiz did in this greatest of all Hollywood World War II adventure romances.",
    "A peerless example of Hollywood studio moviemaking, director Michael Curtiz turning the Warner backlot into a gloriously romantic vision of WW2-era Morocco crammed with real-life European exiles and larger-than-life character actors.",
    "The Warners here have a picture which makes the spine tingle and the heart take a leap. For once more, as in recent Bogart pictures, they have turned the incisive trick of draping a tender love story within the folds of a tight topical theme. They have used Mr. Bogart's personality, so well established in other brilliant films, to inject a cold point of tough resistance to evil forces afoot in Europe today. And they have so combined sentiment, humor and pathos with taut melodrama and bristling intrigue that the result is a highly entertaining and even inspiring film.",
    "The film still works beautifully: its complex propagandist subtexts and vision of a reluctantly martial America’s ‘stumbling’ morality still intrigue, just as Bogart’s cult reputation among younger viewers still obtains.",
    "More an icon than a work of art, CASABLANCA is still thoroughly entertaining romantic melodrama, flawlessly directed, subtly played, lovingly evoking our collective daydreams about lost chances and lost loves and love versus honor; everything about CASABLANCA is just right--it seems to have been filmed under a lucky star.",
    "Part of what makes this wartime Hollywood drama (1942) about love and political commitment so fondly remembered is its evocation of a time when the sentiment of this country about certain things appeared to be unified.",
    "Nothing short of an invasion could add much to Casablanca.",
    "Ingrid Bergman makes a charming and beautiful refugee and Paul Henried gives a convincing performance in the role of the ardent anti-Nazi leader. Claude Rains gives one of his best performances as the police chief and Conrad Veidt is properly menacing as the Nazi officer. Sydney Greestreet is wonderful as the slick proprietor of the Blue Parrot and Rick’s rival in the cafe business."

For reference, I just watched it for the first time ever in 2021.  “Casablanca” is a story of convictions, romance, and lost love.  Right from the beginning it throws so much at you that it is hard to keep up, and the story goes in so many unexpected directions.  There are a ton of characters, and yet somehow, every one of them, with the exception of the Nazis, won me over.  This movie is super heavy on dialog, but unlike modern cinema where characters talk just to fill time, the dialog in “Casablanca” feels like it is all in support of the plot, which forces you to hang on every word or else you will get lost. Anyone with a tolerance of full framed black and white should be able to take something enjoyable away from this movie.  I give it an A - Make a point to go see this movie.",

I honestly don't care that it's an old film, I personally think that's not a convincing enough excuse for hating a film as wonderful as this , because you are seriously missing out, if you haven't seen it. The cinematography is just fantastic, with clever brooding camera-work. The music by Max Steiner is outstanding, from the sweeping haunting love theme As Time Goes By, to the excerpts of the french national anthem. The scene where everyone starts singing in the café was extraordinary and one of the many highlights of the film. The screenplay is unquestionably one of the finest in the history of cinema, right up there with Shawshank Redemption and All About Eve, containing great memorable lines such as \"seems as though Destiny is at hand\". The performances were superlative, Humphrey Bogart giving one of cinema's greatest lead performances as the \"cynical sentimentalist\" Rick Blain. Also superb are Ingrid Bergman who positively lights up the screen as Ilsa, the young woman who breaks his heart, Paul Henreid as the fugitive husband, and Claude Rains as Captain Renault. The plot is a little complicated, but I couldn't help being impressed with the performances and the screenplay. Not to mention a timeless love story that I don't think has ever been topped. Overall, a masterpiece, that quite rightly received an academy award for best picture. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

And I think it is his supervision that blends in sacrifice in romance, so pure and irreplaceable, that drama is overshadowed by its crowd pleasing concept. The director, Michael Curtiz installs tiny notions in the script that carves a momentum of live hotel and the do's and don'ts of a hotelier especially the magnetic reputation he or she juggles by dipping his or her hands on both the side of the dirt.The Robin Hood figure, is their way in, and with Humphrey Bogart playing one of the most iconic character, the first act of the film is building up his figure that is latter to be shattered with such fragility. But the final act is brimmed with charm, so where they actually had to work was the introduction. And choreographed like some exotic dance, the entire hotel that is mapped out in front of us, makes us feel like home something that has aged well over the years. Personally, I prefer the sacrifice of his hotel's fairness regarding the gambling policies.To me, that would always be the game changer, not only the actress's performance but the tone that shifts with such calculative baby steps that you are sinking in deliberately in those twinkling eyes. And if Bogart is boasting off with some of his best work then Ingrid Bergman definitely casts the magic powerful enough to rubble him down in a blink. Their equation is like some wine, you are buzzed with the aftermath soberness rather than their poetic romantic vacation. Casablanca defines the Hollywood version of Americana set in a different location, it was ahead of its time then and it is now; all hail the classic dish serving one purpose and one only.",
