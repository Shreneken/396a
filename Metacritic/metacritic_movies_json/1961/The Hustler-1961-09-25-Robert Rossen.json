  "critic_reviews": [
    "The Hustler is one of those films where scenes have such psychic weight that they grow in our memories. That's true of the matches between Eddie and Fats.",
    "One of the most compelling character-based films to emerge from the decade of the 1960s.",
    "There's a huge amount of style in this picture, but also a huge amount of substance underpinning it.",
    "This dark stunner, based on Walter Tevis's novel, boasts Paul Newman in the role that made him an overnight superstar.",
    "The Hustler is one of the highlights of Paul Newman‘s career. The film is often ranked as one of the best films of its time, largely thanks to Newman’s excellent portrayal of the down beaten Felson.",
    "Paul Newman won his Best Actor Oscar for its 1986 sequel, The Color of Money, but he executed an equally award-worthy turn in Robert Rossen’s jazzy, boozy pool-hall morality play.",
    "A postnoir melodrama with metaphysical trimmings, it does remarkable things with mood and pacing, and the two matches with Gleason as Minnesota Fats are indelible.",
    "The sequences crackle with vitality as well as setting subtly the characterizations and packing the explosives to be detonated later.",
    "Like the best sports films, The Hustler makes the game look exciting even to outsiders, but Rossen's film is ultimately about a more universal subject than impossible breaks and the heavy spin of masse shots. Adapting Walter Tevis' novel, Rossen made a morality tale without the moralizing.",
    "The film is marred slightly by an over-abrupt ending and the irritating device of speeded-up clocks, but these are minor flaws in a film that has grown in stature over the years.",
    "A wonderful hymn to the last true era when men of substance played pool with a vengeance.",
    "Dingy atmosphere and great performances make this a standout.",
    "With solid performances, a great jazz score by Kenyon Hopkins, and a virtual clinic in how to do black-and-white cinematography thanks to Eugene Shuftan’s camerawork, The Hustler reaffirms your faith in the movies.",
    "Rossen treats the jousts at the pool tables here like mythic battles waged by legendary knights on a playing field composed of nicotine, dirty felt and wasted dreams.",
    "Under Robert Rossen's strong direction, its ruthless and odorous account of one young hustler's eventual emancipation is positive and alive. It crackles with credible passions. It comes briskly and brusquely to sharp points.",
    "The fun in this moody, pounding, overlong, rewarding bring-down of a film is seeing Eddie’s curled lip of contempt, which he flashes at all the suckers, freeze into a rictus when he gets his.",
    "Unfoldment of the screenplay, based on novel by Walter S. Tevis, is far overlength, and despite the excellence of Newman’s portrayal of the boozing pool hustler the sordid aspects of overall picture are strictly downbeat."

      "content": "Newman loses in this fixed game and come out the only winner, survivor of the filthy politics.The Hustler\n\nRossen is a sports man. His drama is not some drama. The tears are real as much as rotten the game is. But the director, RobertNewman loses in this fixed game and come out the only winner, survivor of the filthy politics.The HustlerRossen is a sports man. His drama is not some drama. The tears are real as much as rotten the game is. But the director, Robert Rossen is concerned on both the aspects of this game, the up front razzle dazzle that can easily gather a crowd and the back stage drama that drives the fear in this high staked tense game. And let me start by the first game, the best game, of the film. Not only is it smartly calculated but also informative. For someone jumping in on this sport, for the first time, the baby steps are taken beautifully that marks both the magnitude and the rules of the genre parallel-y.Aforementioned, the game or the onstage drama can never even be compared with the emotional conflicts that the broken lead couple goes through. Now so similar are these tracks placed that you find yourself immersed in them without telling apart what's the act or who is acting. Breaking down this game, analysing it, the commentary of Paul Newman as the infamous Fast Eddie is a sight to behold. Watch him fail, love, cheat and then fail again with a drunken voice and sober body language while playing, he makes sure he lives up to the title given by the crowd, Fast.Enters, Piper Laurie, her performance is as rich and powerful as her character. Not only can she empower him, but she gets to challenge the Fast Eddie and make him slow down. As a memory, she comes in and \"makes him up\" whispering and begging in one of the finest scenes of the film where mirrors are placed in front of each other, expressing to us, their interest and intentions, coming from The Hustler, you ought to note these things, trying to catch him out, you won't though.",
