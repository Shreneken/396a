    "critic_reviews": [
        "The film has always been a favorite of those who enjoy visual and dramatic flamboyance.",
        "Brilliant.",
        "A masterclass in tension, visual panache and B-movie excess.",
        "Astonishing cinematography and brilliantly played, this certainly one of the most influential crime movies in history.",
        "Touch of Evil proceeds with one of the most celebrated long-takes in screen history. The sequence is a marvel of technical virtuosity and staged action. From the very start, Orson Welles\u2019s grubby and sweaty noir classic has us in its grip with a gloriously devised piece of showmanship emblematic of the director\u2019s audaciously talented spirit.",
        "Eternal damnation to the wretch at Universal who printed the opening titles over the most brilliant establishing shot in film history\u2014a shot that establishes not only place and main characters in its continuous movement over several city blocks, but also the film's theme (crossing boundaries), spatial metaphors, and peculiar bolero rhythm.",
        "Welles manages to wring engaging performances out of all of his actors, but what's most impressive about the film is the way in which the director makes use of every corner of the screen with deliberate precision.",
        "This nightmarish descent into dark entertainment has so much weirdness going on it's amazing.",
        "No amount of repeated viewings can dull the edge of its sinister ambience or soften the visual excitement Welles brought to this quintessentially cinematic film. [Director's Cut]",
        "A film noir great... Just to see and hear the extraordinary 3 minute and 20 second opening sequence \u2014 a fluid tour de force tracking shot \u2014 without impediment of opening credits and street-sound-masking movie score is accomplishment enough.",
        "Still seems close to the pinnacle of film noir. [Director's Cut]",
        "As masterful as Welles's filming is, what makes Touch of Evil a staggering masterpiece is the global quality of his style, which causes every image to echo almost every other in the film.",
        "Welles goes for broke in his performance and direction, and the only trick he misses is a tracking shot around his own bulging waistline. [Director's Cut]",
        "Mr. Welles' is an obvious but brilliant bag of tricks. Using a superlative camera (manned by Russell Metty) like a black-snake whip, he lashes the action right into the spectator's eye. [22 May 1958, p.25]",
        "The great director's masterpiece of bad juju. [Director's Cut]",
        "Touch of Evil is a savvy starter because Welles' astonishing cinematic invention and his persuasive presence as star are prime noir at tractions. The look, a deftly arranged climate of odd shadows and angles, neon lighting and flawlessly choreographed action scenes, keeps interest piqued through a contrived plot and mannered acting.",
        "Touch of Evil smacks of brilliance but ultimately flounders in it."

Also interesting is that Welles' character mirrored his life at that time.  I saw the 1998 version, reconstructed from Welles' notes.  It is fantastic, his 2nd best movie, just have to get past Charlton Heston as a Mexican.",
