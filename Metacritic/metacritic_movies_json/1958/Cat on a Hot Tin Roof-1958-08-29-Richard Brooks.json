  "critic_reviews": [
    "Burl Ives, Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor, Judith Anderson, Jack Carson and two or three more almost work and yell themselves to pieces making this drama of strife within a new-rich Southern family a ferocious and fascinating show. And what a pack of trashy people these accomplished actors perform!",
    "Tennessee Williams’ study of a crumbling Southern patriarchy is riveting stuff. Although the word homosexuality is never uttered, this Hollywood reworking brings a certain understanding of the son’s latent “immaturity” and his wife’s childlessness. Bolstered by extraordinary performances, this tale’s a summer sizzler.",
    "The performances are the thing in this film version of the Tennessee Williams stage triumph, led by Ives, repeating his stage role like a force of nature.",
    "The manipulative Maggie, irritated by the heat and by Gooper and Sister Woman’s ”no-neck monsters,” is among Taylor’s most accomplished creations and earned her a second Oscar nod; the performance has an inner coil in it, as if something were ready to spring at any second.",
    "Taylor has a major credit with her portrayal of Maggie. The frustrations and desires, both as a person and a woman, the warmth and understanding she molds, the loveliness that is more than a well-turned nose – all these are part of a well-accented, perceptive interpretation.",
    "The 1958 film Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is not a good adaptation of Tennessee Williams’s play of the same name. But as a portrayal of the depths of loneliness we create for ourselves, and an example of the power of star performance, it’s a great film.",
    "As so often with adaptations of Williams, it frequently errs on the side of overstatement and pretension, but still remains immensely enjoyable as a piece of cod-Freudian codswallop.",
    "In his four earlier films, Williams seemed to need a warmup of two backward steps before he could take one step forward, but at least the movement was visible and real. This time, Adapter-Director Richard Brooks has been able to put very little motion in his motion picture. His Cat is a formaldehyded tabby that sits static while layer after layer of its skin is peeled off, life after life of its nine lives unsentimentally destroyed. But in Williams, Brooks has a rare playwright who can make his static electric, and a blinkered grope toward the past as suspenseful as a headlong crash into the future.",
    "Two of cinema's most iconic stars on top form make this worth a good look.",
    "The material has been bowdlerized to the point of abstraction, which makes Richard Brooks's sweaty, emphatic direction look a little silly—there just isn't that much to get worked up about. But Burl Ives and Judith Anderson are highly entertaining as the nightmare parents, Big Daddy and Big Mama, and Jack Carson has one of his last good roles as Newman's competitive older brother.",
    "The performances are sweltering...This isn’t a good thing. Yes, it’s fitting for the setting – a humid, suffocating Louisiana mansion where the family of an ailing tycoon (Burl Ives) connives to inherit his fortune – but the overall result is like watching a melodrama in a sauna. It’s just too much."

      "content": "This film is based on an interesting play by Tennessee Williams, that has already become a classic of American theater. Therefore, I believe that expectations for the film were high, when it opened, for the Anglophone audience. For me, who doThis film is based on an interesting play by Tennessee Williams, that has already become a classic of American theater. Therefore, I believe that expectations for the film were high, when it opened, for the Anglophone audience. For me, who do not know the work of Williams, it is different: I cannot compare the film with a book I have never read or a play I have never seen.The script focuses on a birthday party at the southern plantation of Big Daddy. The party brings the whole family together because it is known that he will die soon, but that is something that everyone decided to hide from him. He has two children: Gooper, the youngest son, has always done everything his father wanted, married a self-interested woman and has a collection of annoying children; on the other hand, Brick is the opposite, having never had an easy relationship with his father. Alcoholic due to a past hurt and a failed sports career, he married the beautiful Maggie \"the Cat\", whom no one in the house seems to like. When Big Daddy returns from the hospital, convinced that he is in good health, he takes the opportunity to say a lot of what he always thought to each one of those present. This will be the catalyst for many family secrets to be revealed or unearthed.I found the film quite interesting because of the way it plays with a trivial family moment - a birthday party - to create a real family drama. I don't need to read Williams' book to believe that the film was faithful to him: even without having done so, I give credit to the screenwriter's work, even though I know that certain aspects, such as allusions to homosexuality, have been greatly diminished. However, I did not understand why Maggie is called (or calls herself) \"Cat\", even though I understand that she does not feel desired by her husband.The film has a luxurious and notable cast, which does very well both for the effort and the quality of its dialogues. Burl Ives is noteworthy for the effort with which he embodies his character, but Paul Newman is not far behind and is excellent in the way he gives Brick more pain, more psychological intensity than one might expect. Elizabeth Taylor, alongside her, obtains with this film one of the most iconic interpretations of her career, although the character is quite secondary in the story told. She can make Maggie a pleasant character, who is deeply interested, but she can be human and have a big heart too. She establishes a collaboration and chemistry with Newman that is admirable. Jack Carson and Madeleine Sherwood are quite competent in their roles.Technically, it is a very restrained film, leaving the actors' interpretation to speak for itself. Cinematography is extraordinarily beautiful for a film so many years old, the colors are vivid and the light was very well-used, like rain and night, with a storm outside to accompany the storm that unfolded inside. The costumes and sets are very good, the house looks a lot like the plantation of Twelve Oakes, from \"Gone With The Wind\". The soundtrack fulfills its role.",
