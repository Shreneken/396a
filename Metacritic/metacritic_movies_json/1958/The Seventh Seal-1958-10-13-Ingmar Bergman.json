  "critic_reviews": [
    "The directness of The Seventh Seal is its strength: This is an uncompromising film, regarding good and evil with the same simplicity and faith as its hero.",
    "Ingmar Bergman's dark masterpiece effortlessly sees off the revisionists and the satirists; it is a radical work of art that reaches back to scripture, to Cervantes and to Shakespeare to create a new dramatic idiom of its own.",
    "A piercing and powerful contemplation of the passage of man upon this earth. Essentially intellectual, yet emotionally stimulating, too, it is as tough—and rewarding—a screen challenge as the moviegoer has had to face this year.",
    "Dark but beautiful.",
    "Full of haunting, iconic images and a touch of hopeful humanity, The Seventh Seal is cinema at its most artful, a philosophical meditation on the meaning(lessness) of this mortal coil.",
    "Prepare to fawn at Bergman’s most metaphysically profound film; you may even laugh.",
    "What's most important here is that THE SEVENTH SEAL, for all its downbeat aspects, is so gripping as to be entertaining in an enlightening way. Less austere and more visually striking than some of Bergman's later films.",
    "Film has superior technical narrative, impressive lensing and thesping.",
    "There’s a lot going on in Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal, with its striking imagery, bawdy humor, and grim suffering; it’s a humane film about the inhumane inevitability of death. I’m still not much of a cinephile (this is my second Bergman film, and I only watched The Virgin Spring so I could compare it in an essay to The Last House On The Left), but I’m coming to realize that the difference between a good movie and a great one are those moments of intense personal connection where it seems like the filmmaker is reaching out to you through the screen and whispering (or yelling, or cajoling, or demanding, or pleading) in your ear. As if there is no real distance between you and the director, time has changed nothing, and the moment remains as pure as it was on the day it was filmed.",
    "Max von Sydow gives a performance of a high order as the knight who returns from the Crusades to find his country at the mercy of plague and witch hunts.",
    "The Seventh Seal, assisted by cinematographer Gunnar Fischer’s richly overexposed images, operates as though it contains the undiluted essence of life’s fueling dialectic formula. Occasionally it does, most notably in the terrifying arrival of the self-flagellants to a weak-willed village. But the road-trippers in Bergman’s follow-up, Wild Strawberries, achieve a far greater grace and clarity with only a fraction of the heavy lifting.",
    "The film in fact consists of a series of dull speeches spun on simple themes; Bergman barely tries to make the material function dramatically."

The plot doesn't exactly entirely make sense but it also doesn't entirely matter. I'd say there's an element of farce about it and it even features some (brief) toilet humour/references, which is surprisingly for a film of its age (it was released in the late 1950s).Its different to the usual black and white films I see or have seen but I thought it was surprisingly amusing and surreal, so its certainly an entertaining watch, even though it covers quite serious thematic material, mainly mortality. As the film went on, I felt more engrossed in the story and the characters, which has to be a good sign, hence my rating. The slow drum beats often present in the background help to add to the tension as well.I'd recommend this particularly to fans of quirky, classic (perhaps arthouse type) films I suppose - after all, who doesn't want to see a film with scenes featuring death playing chess? (I wonder if the Bill & Ted Bogus Journey film with a similar scene was taking the pee out of that? I bet you didn't expect to read 'Bill & Ted' in a review of a film such as this but, well, there you go!).",

The film creates an environment that is filled to the brim with cynicism with a hint of metaphors. The idea of life against death serves as only a subplot for a film that primarily focuses on how much stress the human psyche can handle. When all is unveiled, the film leaves you wanting more from its surprisingly short running time. Regardless, the film is dark, innovative, and smart. It is one of the most cynical films I have ever seen. For filmmakers, this film is a must-see.",
