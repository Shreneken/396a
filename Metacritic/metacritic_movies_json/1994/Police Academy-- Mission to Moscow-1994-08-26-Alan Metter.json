    "Since all these revisited series have run out of steam, this sorry sequel is only recommended for aging nostalgists.",
    "Energetically humourless, with travelogue and circus footage inserted between the dog-piss and big boob jokes.",
    "An inept, geriatric romp that's for completists only.",
    "Lame, sloppy, cack-handed, utterly redundant - put succinctly, the very worst of the series."

It is the weakest movie in it and your only hope is that it is in the “So bad it is good” category of your taste. Even my childhood nostalgia cant prevent me from disliking this movie. It is just a shell of what we have started. I continues the trend of being more cheesy and silly than the previous movie in the franchise. Unluckily it is not the good kind that in combination with the cast made it charming and enjoyable.  It is again more like a ticking off things from a to do list without having the insight why these have worked in the first movies. It is even worse as we have 2 legendary actors as support with Ron Pearlman and Christopher Lee. The title Mission to Moscow is what you get. The chief of Moscow’s police Commandant Rakov has problems in dealing with the rich and famous businessman by day and secretly crime-boss by night Kostantine Konali (open secret without any provable evidence or witnesses;-). Because he knows Commandant Lassard from the past he asks him for help as his man / woman are efficient and as outsiders is certainly not on Konalis pay-list or even radar.  There is also relevance to a video game from Konali called The Game (zero creativity for naming this). This is the set up for the movie. I have been repeating this for the last movies and say it again. There is so much potential here and I see the sparks of things that could be awesome. However it does not work as the story is not immersive and not enjoyable enough. It is tasteless and boring compared to the first 3 movies and even the next three had more redeeming qualities. The humor is mostly weak and failed to get laughs out of me. What I truly hate is that we have lost so many actors of the great cast (Clarification: Lost not in the way of passing but in the way of never returning to the franchise). This continued from (later) movie to movie. It is a last man standing situation. Left are George Gaynes (Eric Lassard), David Graf (Eugene Tackleberry), Michael Winslow (Larvell Jones), G. W. Bailey(Thaddeus Harris) and Leslie Easterbrook (Debbie Callahan). That means we have lost from the last movie: Bubba Smith (Moses Hightower), Matt McCoy (Nick Lassard), Marion Ramsey (Laverne Hooks), Bruce Mahler (Douglas Fackler) and Lance Kinsey (Carl Proctor). I am a huge fan of the cast but here they cant deliver and their ranks are so thinned out. I have respect for all of them and say they were cast in a horrible script. Non of the characters works well here and it pains me to say this. These were so iconic and our childhood favorites. But this is not even me. It failed at the box office and is hated by fans and critics. Overall this is a sad end of a once great franchise and I must warn you from this movie. Like I said the only hope is that it has the so bad it is good (=entertaining) appeal for you which is even more sad.",
