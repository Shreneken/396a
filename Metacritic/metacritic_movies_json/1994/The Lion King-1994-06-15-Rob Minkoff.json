    "critic_reviews": [
        "A technically groundbreaking collaborative work with humor, heart, and talent showing through in every carefully chosen line.",
        "Pure, eye-popping pleasure.",
        "A hugely entertaining blend of music, fun and eye-popping thrills, though it doesn't lack for heart.",
        "A scrumptiously delightful moviegoing experience.",
        "Has the resonance to stand not just as a terrific cartoon but as an emotionally pungent movie.",
        "More so than the exuberant movie miracles that came before it, this latest animated juggernaut has the feeling of a clever, predictable product. To its great advantage, it has been contrived with a spirited, animal-loving prettiness no child will resist.",
        "A timeless classic, full of excitement, humor, witty asides and memorable characters.",
        "This is the Mickey Mouse factory at its finest, with inventive animation, stirring music and a pride of inspired, almost-human animals.",
        "There are moments of fun and humor, to be sure, but the undercurrent is of a far more serious, \"adult\" nature.  The Lion King is primarily about guilt and redemption.",
        "Basically what we have here is a drama, with comedy occasionally lifting the mood. The result is a surprising seriousness; this isn't the mindless romp with cute animals.",
        "This is more a favourite of the children than adult Disney fans. It has a few memorable songs and has spawned a very popular stage production.",
        "The Lion King remains one of the strongest Disney efforts of the 1990s, and arguably its last great, traditionally animated feature.",
        "A dazzling -- and unexpectedly daring -- addition to the Disney canon.",
        "Even with its flaws, this latest Disney animated feature once again delivers what its audience wants.",
        "It's a thumping good adventure.",
        "It bears repeating that The Lion King is quite entertaining as children's fare goes these days. But Disney has established a standard so high on animated features that anything less than a classic leaves you feeling that something's missing.",
        "For all the undeniable merits, it somehow feels manufactured, and thus, to a degree, calculated - the product not of a collective imagination taking esthetic chances, but of an imaginative collective putting the rivets into a well-wrought plan that can't go awry.",
        "The result is a step toward multiculturalism and ecological correctness, though not without a certain amount of confusion. The movie is not quite as entertaining as The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast.",
        "Although far from the worst offender in Disney's canon, The Lion King is nevertheless host to many of the less savory qualities common to the studio's output.",
        "The film has some of Disney's most spectacular animation yet -- particularly in the wildebeest stampede -- and strong vocal performances, especially by skilled Broadway comedian Nathan Lane. However, it suffers from a curiously undeveloped story line.",
        "Shakespearean in tone, epic in scope, it seems more appropriate for grown-ups than for kids. If truth be told, even for adults it is downright strange."

This film I want to say is my best Disney film however I also love Aladdin :). Then B&TB and Hercules. Anyway. This film has a lot of guidance and morals for all ages. Makes me think whats happened to Disney :( Mufasa (James Earl Jones) is Simba's dad and has the perfect voice for a strong lion teaching his son the lessons in life. Like not to take being future king for granted, it's not about getting your own way. And that everyone is one. He also tells his son about the stars, and if he is not here in later life, then to look up at the stars as all of the great kings are up there watching over him. Samba being a small cub has to learn the hard way because of his evil uncle scar. At first he truss to trick samba and forces him to go against his fathers will. It ends up with samba leaving pride rock, but finds two true friends who bring him back to his normal self with the help of an old friend and his fathers friend who christened him at birth. Samba returns to pride Rock some years later, returning the once great land back to how it used to be. And continues with Simba and Nala having a child of there own. And continues, the circle of life. such powerful scenes that can make grown men cry (who are not dead inside) and powerful voice acting that fit each roll perfectly. A brilliant soundtrack that fits very well. And also the meanings and morals in this film alone are what society today is very rappdley loosing. If only James Earl jones could be the king of England! Ohh and must say that I love zazu too :) (probally spelt it wrong)",

The songs were memorable and amazing, the characters were believable (and arguably acted more human than many movies with human actors), and the animation was vibrant and lush, depicting a unique style of art, and still getting the movements of the characters down pat. The story really digs deep into Simba's character, which leaves the other characters a bit stagnant, but that's not to say they aren't developed. They each have their own part to play in the story. The comic relief detracts from the heavier story just enough to keep the feature from being too depressing (it is disney, they like a lighter feel to their movies).Now, on the controversy some people have brought up about \"Disney ripping off 'Kimba: The White Lion'\", I looked into it, and in terms of story and characters, it seems the two are separate. Some art direction seems to have gone the same direction, although Disney and the guys who did Kimba did start working together on a project related to Kimba. The project was scrapped, but the people who had worked on the project probably decided to adapt some concept art to Lion King. Btw, the similarity of the names \"Simba\" and \"Kimba\" is probably coincidental, considering most of the names in \"The Lion King\" are based on Swahili words (simba means 'lion').Regardless, it is a solid movie that I recommend.",

This movie entices children with its memorable songs and fantastic characters. It is one of Disney\u2019s greatest musicals, even though there are some scary moments. Despite the few violent scenes, the overall messages portrayed are hope, love, family, and responsibility. This film is a great choice for children as well as adults.\rThe film is about Simba (Jonathon Taylor Thomas) and how he \u201cjust can\u2019t wait to be king.\u201d That being said, his evil Uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) is extremely jealous of his brother Mufasa (James Earl Jones) because Mufasa is the king of the jungle. His extreme jealously gets the best of him, and Scar has Mufasa killed by a stampede and makes Simba feel responsible. Simba, feeling overwhelming guilt and despair, then runs away and becomes friends with Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) and Timon (Nathan Lane) who teach him that the best philosophy is \u201cHakuna Matata\u201d, which means no worries. Simba is having the best time while with Timon and Pumbaa. He feels free and great about himself because he has nothing to worry about. Simba grows up thinking he has escaped his childhood until his old friend Nala, who is living under Scar\u2019s leadership, finds him and tells him that the tribe has been having severe issues.\rThe Lion King was originally inspired by William Shakespeare\u2019s play, Hamlet. The Lion King\u2019s themes and imagery relate to cultural and political situations in the United States and Africa. Along with this, many parts of the film resemble a famous Japanese television show Kimba the White Lion. Two characters in this show are Kimba and Simba. In The Lion King, the camera angles and composition are almost identical to this television show. The voice of Simba almost believed he was working on a remake of Kimba because he was familiar with the show. The movie is mainly about lifestyle choices and collective responsibility. This is where the majority of the movie got several of its ideas.\rThe protagonist, Simba, starts off as a rebellious character whom then grows up and learns to accept his responsibilities instead of seeking revenge. The characters in the film are always filled with energy which shows how much hard work went into each character and their personality, looks, and overall appearance. Each character has there own appealing look and personality, which draws so much attention to them. Along with this, they each have a voice that is very engaging to listen to. The characters have comical senses of humor and perform each scene in a joyful way. When Mufasa emerges in a cloud for Simba and talks to him, he gives Simba hope and inspires him to go and regain his throne. This scene shows how family is always there for you, even when all hope is gone. Not only are the characters funny, but they have a meaningful and serious side as well.\rThe Lion King is a spectacular film for all ages. Although the movie is a cartoon, it is appealing to adults as well because it has a message behind it that can captivate even the oldest of audiences. Even if the children do not grasp the entirety of the overall message, they still love the film because of its entertainment. It keeps you interested the entire time and captivates everyone into feeling compelled to finish it. The directors and producers used great sounds effects and were able to get the audience to sing along with them. The colors and their brightness that was used enhances the film and makes it much more enjoyable and fun to watch. Every scene has an attracting look and amusing music, which always makes it pleasurable to watch. They used music to connect the funny scenes back to the overall message such as \u201cCircle of Life\u201d and \u201cHakuna Matata\u201d. Circle of Life is played during the ceremony when Simba is born and at the end for Simba and Nala\u2019s newborn club. Simba is baptized here and the whole kingdom comes together to see him. Hakuna Matata is played when Simba arrives at the jungle home and continues to play during a sequence in which Simba grows up. This shows that Simba puts his problems behind him and lives the life he wants. The music makes a child not want to take their eyes off the screen because of the energetic characters and catchy rhythm. The filmmakers used animated programs to show their visuals. The stampede scene was created in a 3D computer program so the characters could be multiplied. The visuals are very clever and give off a fun, loving, and spirited tone. The movie is presented with amazing animation, music, and choreography. The animators of the story studied real-life animals for reference and some even journeyed on a trip to Africa. This assisted in how the animators made the characters act during many of the scenes. This also helped them to better understand the animal environment and way of life. A wildlife expert visited the studio to help the writers with the animal behavior and to help the artists with their drawings. Brenda Chapman, one of the story heads, said that writing an original story is very challenging because there is nothing to fall back on.\rThe Lion King displays that if one is in a dark place, be strong and take the next challenge as it comes. Each character has there own way of doing this, which makes the film so much more interesting to watch. The film portrays many different ideas and responsibilities making it a movie for everyone to watch and enjoy with a lesson learned. The writers created a wonderful original story. The filmmakers did an incredible job with the characters, scenery, and animation. The Lion King is a warm, loving, fun film that everyone should have a chance to see.",

The 1990s was a very strong decade for the Walt Disney Studios, as they came off a string of successes with 'The Little Mermaid' (1989), 'Beauty and the Beast' (1991) (this is MY favorite Disney film) and 'Aladdin' (1992).\r Even after 'The Lion King', there were other films that were not appreciated by the critics mostly, but audiences loved anyway, 'Pocahontas' (1995) and 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' (1996) spring to mind.\r 'The Lion King' is essentially Hamlet, but with lions, it opens with the best opening sequence I've seen in any film, animated or live-action. \"The Circle of Life\" is an iconic song to open with an we see the sun rising and all the different animals of different breeds gather around to witness the birth of their new future king. A lion cub is lifted before them and the animals bow together. The lion cub is Simba and we witness his adventure in the movie.\r We meet his uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) who is jealous as he wants to be king, but the birth of Simba compromises his chances, and his brother Mufasa (James Earl Jones) tries to reason with Scar.\r Simba gets into a predicament where Scar plans to kill Mufasa and tells Simba to run away. Unlike Disney's 'Bambi' (1942), the death of Mufasa happens on-screen and can be traumatizing to the younger audience.\r As Simba has run away, he meets a meerkat and a warthog, Timon and Pumbaa who raise Simba from his teen years into his adulthood. But when Scar is king of Pride Rock, the entire group want Simba back and gain his status as the rightful king.\r Of all the Disney films released in the 1990s, 'The Lion King' is the one people speak highly of the most, and for good reason as it is less sugar-coated than 'The Little Mermaid' and 'Beauty and the Beast' and less comical than 'Aladdin'. The movie tells a serious story with the occasional comedy to lighten up the mood for when the film gets too serious. The songs are catchy too and the story is not hard to follow, even for kids.\r So why did I give this film a 9 instead of the perfect 10 everybody is rating it? Well, I do think that 'Beauty and the Beast' (1991) is actually the best film from Disney and 'The Lion King', for me, has some flaws that prevent it from being perfect. Everybody seems to over-praise this film, but here are my problems.\r The songs for me, were a little disappointing, considering they are by Tim Rice and Elton John, I only loved \"The Circle of Life\" and \"Be Prepared\"...I found \"I Just can't wait to be King\" and \"Hakuna Matata\" a little annoying, even as a kid. \"Can you feel the love tonight?\" felt a little shoe-horned in the film, but the Elton John version is brilliant.\r Certain things happen in the third act still make no sense to me, even as a child I didn't understand and still don't understand now. Let's just say that a certain character admits their faults and the film can end after that. I couldn't help but feel that the third act felt rushed just so it can get to the conclusion.\r However, the positives do outweigh the negatives, the animation is still as beautiful as ever (particularly \"The Circle of Life\" sequence), the film tells a really good story and there is pure heart and emotion put into this picture.\r I don't think 'The Lion King' is the best Disney film of all time, that title, for me, goes to 'Beauty and the Beast' (1991), but this is definitely in my top 10.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThe artistic medium of film is very subjective. Every audience member has a different set of criteria they use to measure their viewing experience. Not everyone shares the same set of criteria. If we did, what a bland and uninspired world this would be.\r What I Personally Liked About \"The Lion King\":\rEvery good film starts with a good skeletal structure: the story itself. From that story, all of the other pieces will fall into place. In this case, the story is a beautifully told one centered on familial commitment, the responsibilities you have to yourself and the obligations you have to those who count on your support. The maturation of a destined character has always been a great structural starting point and this time it delivers in abundance. There is also some very good hard-edged humor, particularly surrounding Scar, which doesn't play down to younger audiences. Instead, it treats all of its viewers as equals; something modern Disney filmmakers have a tendency to toss aside. The animation itself is peerless, filled with wonderfully bright colors, crisp lines, deep shadows, lush greenery, and sharply drawn leads. The animation is backed with some of the best voice work Disney had yet utilized in one of their movies. James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg and Nathan Lane fill the spotlight with their charm and add a wonderful dimension to the characters they portray. There are a couple of unforgettable specifics to this animated classic to go over as well. Mufasa's death scene, for one. It is a somber, restrained affair with a perfectly accented score and a real sense of loss defining the event. Too, the epic, slow motion fight sequence between Simba and Scar backlit by the burning embers beneath Pride Rock is a visually stunning treat one rarely sees in a Disney film.\r What I Personally Disliked About \"The Lion King\":\rThere is a song in this film entitled \"Be Prepared.\" Not only is it the weakest song of the picture, but it is also the worst blot on Jeremy Irons' otherwise impeccable career. Irons gives a menacing performance throughout the rest of the film. His dark, creepy delivery of the lines sends chills up and down my spine each and every time I hear them. That merely makes this horrible song seem more out of place. It shamefully slows down the pace of the film where a macabre monologue would have better served the purpose of the story. Fortunately, there's really not much else to dislike about this presentation.\r My Overall Impression of \"The Lion King\":\rNot only would I classify this as the single best film Disney released in its decade, I would also offer the opinion that this is the best film Disney has released since 1994 (excluding Pixar's involvement). It has a wealth of memorable music, a powerful story arc, excellent animation, and fitting vocal performances. Animation simply does not get much better than this.",

The inspiration for these recent films comes fromThe film is the latest in a series of annual media events from Disney, which with \"The Little Mermaid,\" \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"Aladdin\" reinvented its franchise of animated feature films. The inspiration for these recent films comes from the earliest feature cartoons created by Walt Disney himself, who in movies like \"Dumbo,\" with the chaining of Mrs. Jumbo, and \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\" with its wicked stepmother, tapped into primal fears and desires. Later Disney films drifted off into the neverland of innocuous \"children's movies,\" which were harmless but not very exciting. These most recent four animated features are once again true \"family films,\" in that they entertain adults as well as children.\r \"The Lion King\" is the first Disney animated feature not based on an existing story. In another sense, it is based on half the stories in classical mythology. It tells the tale of the birth, childhood and eventual manhood of Simba, a lion cub. The cub's birth is announced in the opening sequence of the movie, called \"The Circle of Life,\" which is an evocative collaboration of music and animation to show all of the animals of the African veld gathering to hail their future king. The cute little cub is held aloft from a dramatic spur of rock, and all his future minions below hail him, in a staging that looks like the jungle equivalent of a political rally.\r Of course this coming together of zebra and gazelle, monkey and wildebeest, fudges on the uncomfortable fact that many of these animals survive by eating one another. And all through \"The Lion King\" the filmmakers perform a balancing act between the fantasy of their story and the reality of the jungle. Early scenes show Simba as a cute, trusting little tike who believes everyone loves him. He is wrong. He has an enemy - his uncle Scar, the king's jealous brother, who wants to be king himself one day.\r Villains are often the most memorable characters in a Disney animated film, and Scar is one of the great ones, aided by a pack of yipping hyenas who act as his storm troopers. With a voice by Jeremy Irons, and facial features suggestive of Irons' gift for sardonic concealment, Scar is a mannered, manipulative schemer who succeeds in bringing about the death of the king.\r Worse, he convinces Simba that the cub is responsible, and the guilty little heir slinks off into the wastelands. (The movie makes a sly reference to a famous earlier role by Irons. When Simba tells him, \"You're so weird,\" he replies \"You have no idea,\" in exactly the tone he used in \"Reversal of Fortune.\") It is an unwritten law that animated features have comic relief, usually in the form of a duet or trio of goofy characters who become buddies with the hero. This time they are a meerkat named Timon (voice by Nathan Lane) and a warthog named Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella), who cheer up Simba during his long exile.\r The movie has a large cast of other colorful characters, including a hornbill named Zazu (Rowan Atkinson), who is confidant and advisor to King Mufasa (James Earl Jones). And there are the three hyenas (with voices by Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings), who are a tumbling, squabbling, yammering team of dirty tricks artists.\r The early Disney cartoons were, of course, painstakingly animated by hand. There has been a lot of talk recently about computerized animation, as if a computer program could somehow create a movie. Not so. Human animators are responsible for the remarkably convincing portrayals of Scar and the other major characters, who somehow combine human and animal body language. But computers did assist with several remarkable sequences, including a stampede in which a herd seems to flow past the camera.\r Despite the comic relief from the hyenas, the meerkat and the warthog, \"The Lion King\" is a little more subdued than \"Mermaid,\" \"Beauty\" and \"Aladdin.\" The central theme is a grim one: A little cub is dispossessed, and feels responsible for the death of its father.\r An uncle betrays a trust.\r And beyond the gently rolling plans of the great savanna lies a wasteland of bones and ashes. Some of the musical comedy numbers break the mood, although with the exception of \"Circle of Life\" and \"Hakuna Matata,\" the songs in \"The Lion King\" are not as memorable as those in \"Mermaid\" and \"Beauty.\" Basically what we have here is a drama, with comedy occasionally lifting the mood. The result is a surprising seriousness; this isn't the mindless romp with cute animals that the ads might lead you to expect. Although the movie may be frightening and depressing to the very young, I think it's positive that \"The Lion King\" deals with real issues. By processing life's realities in stories, children can prepare themselves for more difficult lessons later on. The saga of Simba, which in its deeply buried origins owes something to Greek tragedy and certainly to \"Hamlet,\" is a learning experience as well as an entertainment. 3.5/4.",

We wound up shaking our heads afterwards, wondering what made it such a winner. The story is simplistic and violent, and some of the images seem awfully retro in their impact -- for example, all the good guys are a lovely light tawny shade while the villains are dark and, in one scene, the huge glowing eyes and teeth in the dark faces seem designed to make children afraid of African faces for life.

Before I begin, let me ask one question: Why is it that every movie you have saw just literally become such great classics? It's because of their creative efforts and mere pride and this movie is one of them.\r The story tells of a young cub named Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), the son of Mufasa (James Earl Jones) who is destined to become king of the Pride Rock. One day, Simba's ruthless evil uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) plots to take over Pride Rock by killing his father and tricks Simba into feeling guilty which causes him to flee from the kingdom never to return. Once he disappears, he meets two friends named Timon, a meek rat, and Pumbaa, a warthog who helps teach him the meaning of \"Hakuna Matata\". A few years later, after reuniting with his friend Nala, Simba, now an adult (Matthew Broderick) realizes that he doesn't know who he is anymore and is aware that Scar has destroyed everything that the lions had hunted for. He is then persuaded to return to Pride Rock and must overthrow his uncle to restore the kingdom to its rightful place.\r After its success at the box office with $783 dollars which marks this movie as the 32nd highest grossing feature film, everything else has been praised due to Disney and their intelligence.\r The music score by Hans Zimmer and the songs written by Elton John and Tim Rice were considered to be successful in cinema history, The animation and characters were very memorable, The acting was superb and the cinematography was terrific.\r The Lion King is one of the greatest animated movies of all time and is one of my childhood favorites that will teach me that this movie means no worries. Thank you Disney. With your charm and brilliance, a thumbs up from me.\r 10/10",

It is a coming of age or self discovery story transferred in the animal Kingdom. There is a lot more to the story that I cant spoil but will say the story was always entertaining. It has a lot of great additional characters like Timon and Pumbaa who transcended the movie and became the stars of their own show. This is not surprising as they are funny, enjoyable and have a dynamic like only a few duos in Disney movie history. There is of cause Mufasa himself who is a role model for a good and wise king and his brother Scar who is one of the best antagonist in Disney movies. There is also Rafiki who nailed the role of elderly wise man. I will also praise the three hyenas Shenzi, Banzai and Ed as Zazu the majordomos and Nala (cant spoil). The greatest strength are the facial animations that are well transferred to the animals. You can see all (human) emotions and can relate perfectly to the characters. This is a weakness of the remake as more realistic means lifeless or emotionless here. But back to this movie. The overall animations are still looking good today (Aged well). I also praise the soundtrack. They got Elton John and Hans Zimmer (and a lot of other stars). I am the kind of person that does not enjoy singing in Disney movies but this is the exception as it won me over. \u201cHakuna Matata\u201d is great as are \u201cCircle of Life\u201d, \u201cCan you feel the Love tonight\u201d and \u201cI cant wait to be King\u201d. Overall it has a great story with enjoyable characters and you can see the care and thoughtfulness. One of the best Disney movies but a shame that they had to \u201cborrow\u201d so much ideas.",

That being said, this is a timeless work.\r I appreciate that the writers actually took time to research the animals and setting shown in this movie. That is bonus points for me when someone does their homework and executes perfectly.\r If i had to describe this movie in one word, it would be: rainbow. The reason for that is that you will feel all those colors in the rainbow throughout this movie. Yes, it's animated but don't let that ever dictate what is good.\r Watch this with a friend and call up a homie that has seen this before.

It was one of the first movies I ever saw, so that accounts for how much I love it. The animation is superb, the backgrounds look so rich, and for once, there are no stiff movements. The highlights were the stampede and the fight between Scar and Simba. The music by Hans Zimmer is outstanding, a perfect mix of African chants and pure Hollywood. The songs are absolutely great, I had no idea that Elton John could write like that. The best song is \"Can you feel the Love Tonight?\" but the others go without fault, \"Circle of Life\" is so spirit rousing especially. Likewise with the voice overs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is very likable as Young Simba, and Matthew Broderick, while not as good, is above average too. James Earl Jones lends his booming voice to the majestic King Mufassa, and Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg provide flawless comic relief. The vocal standout is Jeremy Irons as Scar, who frightened me when I was little. Scar is up there with the best Disney villains, like Jafar, Malificent and Frollo. The humour here is fantastic, and you cry here a bit here as well. I highly recommend the stage version in the West End, and the sequels are actually two of the better DTV sequels.10/10.

Last time I saw it I was 5 years old, and now, having rewatched it, I realized the plot isn't that good. It merely pleads for sympathy together with a beautiful picture, but isn't motivated or complicated enough if you're older than 7. The whole episode of Simba's return and the fight is just awkward. Also, why would Scar be such a bad king? You can't deny he was clever and probably knew how to rule, while Simba didn't. Each move in the plot, and often even speeches were easilly guessable to me (and I didn't remember anything). Also, Kimba's plot base most probably defined the success of this one.

I've seen the trailers from it in VHS's years ago when I was a kid and teenager, taken from The Fox and the Hound, Sleeping Beauty, Dumbo, Pinocchio, Pocahontas, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Aristocats, Aladdin and The Sword in the Stone. This movie did so well it grossed a total of $968. How's that for a Disney movie. I gotta tell ya, this is one of my favourite Disney films of all time. I think it's everybody favourites as well. Hell, I actually cried at one scene but I'll get to that later. The songs are catchy and memorable like songs called Circle of Life, that's a powerful song, I Just Can't Wait To Be King, the one that I've sing is Be Prepared, there's Hakuna Matata and Can You Feel The Love Tonight. There's another by Elton John which my friend Sam Hudson liked cause he likes Elton John. As you know, the songs are by Elton John and Tim Rice. Even the music sounds different. Listen to the powerful verses from every music taken from every scene from this masterpiece. It's composed by Hans Zimmer. I've just found out that he most movies in the decade. He just the master of music. One of my friends loved it. actually there's only one person who actually love it and that is my friend who is from my old school and who is obsessed with this The Lion King, he's name is Matthew Fender. I gotta tell you, me and Matthew have been quoting dialogue. Like I said me and my friends been doing it non-stop. We were singing songs from it. The animation is just top notch. The animator used the same animation what they did like in The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. They use hand drawn animation and computer animation together to make the animation look realistic. It's fantastic. The characters are memorable and hilariously funny. There's Simba voiced by Matthew Broderick, Mufasa the most powerful king in the entire world and teaches Simba how to become a great king, he is voiced by James Earl Jones, there's Scar who is my favourite Disney villain who is makes me laugh and takes over Pride Rock. He also gets some funny lines like ''That was today? Ohh, I felt simply awful! Must have slip my mind.'' and ''An elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince. Oops!'' Hilarious, isn't it? The two pals Timon and Pumbaa, they're funny and they get there own TV show. Nala who is best friend, Zazu Mufasa's majordomo and guess what? He's voiced by Mr Bean star Rowan Atkinson. How fascinating is that, huh? The wise old Rafiki, shaman of the Pride Lands and then there's three funny hyenas, Shenzi who is sassy and she plays by Whoopi Goldberg, Banzai who is funny and aggressive and he's voiced by Cheech Marin who also voiced Tito from Oliver and Company. Actually two characters from Cheech Marin is hilarious and funny. And Ed who does not talk but only laughs. Man, these characters are so great I could even think the three hyenas who are the highlight of this movie and they even get some funny lines like Banzai says ''Mufasa!'' and other characters Zazu even Timon and Pumbaa. Now let's get on with the scenes. The scenes are hilarious, powerful and groundbraking even the story makes the film strong and extraordinary. The scene where Mufasa shows Simba how to become a great king and the scene where Simba, Nala and Zazu went to the elephant graveyard after Simba singing I Just Can't Wait To The King they come across three hyenas so they escaped but Zazu is captured and puts into the geysor and flew away, the scene where Scar singing ''Be Prepared'' that's a really great song. The stampede scene is just brilliant and so powerful with the most powerful music ever put on film where Simba gets chased by Wildebeests in the gorge and Mufasa saves him and begs Scar to help him but Scar kills Mufasa. Now while I was watching Mufasa's death I was in tears. Remember what I said in the Turner and Hooch film? That's what I mean. And I gotta tell you guys, much like Bambi where Bambi's mom is shot, you don't see the body. In this one though, you see Mufasa's body. That is a saddest and upsetting thing for kids! But what makes the stampede scene look great and magical is the animation. The wildebeests is made from computer animation and the characters are hand drawn animation. It is big! If you take a look of that scene you might be look at it on Blu ray standard because that is the magic. Everyone remembers the songs, the story, the characters, the music, the animation, everything about it is A-MA-ZING! Matthew Fender and I love quoting the lines from it and just like me, Jacob and Liam though this is the most powerful Disney film to be ever remembered and loved. Absolutely phenomenal film! Remember, we are all connected in the great Circle of Life.",

The songs were memorable and amazing, the characters were believable (and arguably acted more human than many movies with human actors), and the animation was vibrant and lush, depicting a unique style of art, and still getting the movements of the characters down pat. The story really digs deep into Simba's character, which leaves the other characters a bit stagnant, but that's not to say they aren't developed. They each have their own part to play in the story. The comic relief detracts from the heavier story just enough to keep the feature from being too depressing (it is disney, they like a lighter feel to their movies).\r Now, on the controversy some people have brought up about \"Disney ripping off 'Kimba: The White Lion'\", I looked into it, and in terms of story and characters, it seems the two are separate. Some art direction seems to have gone the same direction, although Disney and the guys who did Kimba did start working together on a project related to Kimba. The project was scrapped, but the people who had worked on the project probably decided to adapt some concept art to Lion King. Btw, the similarity of the names \"Simba\" and \"Kimba\" is probably coincidental, considering most of the names in \"The Lion King\" are based on Swahili words (simba means 'lion').\r Regardless, it is a solid movie that I recommend.",

It\u2019s not just the songs that I\u2019m talking about the score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is spectacular. The score fits so well with every scene and it helps to intensify the scene. The entire movie is just filled with incredible music. The animation in this film is stunning and, in my opinion, looks better than some of the animated movies we have now a day. The animals have amazing detail on them and you can easily tell that the animators put a lot of effort into making each and every detail. Not just with the animals but the background as well. This is best shown in the \u201cI Just can\u2019t Wait to be King\u201d song where the animators took the time to change up the backgrounds to help convey that this is a dream sequence. I know it\u2019s weird to mention cinematography in an animated film but honestly, this film almost feels like a live-action film and I will do whatever I want because the cinematography is outstanding in this film. From shots where they are showing a bright scene and then quickly changing to dark is just amazing. The characters in this film feel three-dimensional and anybody can easily relate to one or more of the characters. From the people who are free and easy-going like Timon and Pumbaa to the protective parent like Mufasa they all are relatable and had great voice casting. Everybody was perfectly voice casted and I could easily see them as that character. I only really had a problem sometimes with Matthew Broderick where a couple of times I couldn\u2019t really hear it. This film has a great message in it that you shouldn\u2019t run away from your problems but deal with them right then and there in the present.
