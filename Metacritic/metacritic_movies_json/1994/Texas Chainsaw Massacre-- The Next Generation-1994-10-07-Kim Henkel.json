    "critic_reviews": [
        "Manages the difficult feat of being genuinely scary and sharply self-satirical all at once.",
        "Bits and pieces of the story will, on occasion, leave you scratching your head but it, nevertheless, moves rapidly enough to keep you scurrying to keep pace with the new business at hand.",
        "Its own efforts to be tongue-in-cheek, as with a backwoods gunman who quotes Emerson and Machiavelli, fall seriously flat. But should anyone have the patience to look closely, the two leading players do show signs of what would soon make them famous.",
        "Henkel's directing debut isn't incompetent: It's just derivative, pointless and tediously repetitive.",
        "A slightly above-average slasher film that's only partially redeemed by small but endearingly loopy shreds of black humor.",
        "The movie recapitulates the absurdist tabloid-redneck comedy of the great, original Chainsaw without a hint of its primal terror.",
        "The bottom line is that the only Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie that you need is to see is the first."
