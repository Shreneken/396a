Even while braving a nonstop parade of unpredictable shoppers, the clerks manage to play hockey on the roof, visit a funeral home and straighten out their offbeat love lives.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "Randal is a beautiful hostile piece of work that only could have come from America. He's the sort of guy who never put in a quality day at the office in his life, but somehow probably winds up winning the biggest lotto drawing ever with a ticket he stole from his loser best friend's Quickie Mart.",
    "Nothing, no matter how outrageous, is beyond Smith, and his willingness to flaunt cinematic taboos is one of the reasons why Clerks is such a unqualified success.",
    "A randy, irreverent, slice-of-life no-budgeter that's played for laughs and gets them.",
    "Smith's script simply crackles with an endless succession of humorous gags and on-the-ball observations while Anderson's brilliant performance as the shop assistant from hell is worthy of a film 100 times as expensive.",
    "Although a few bits (the film is done in blackout sketch style) fall flat and a good ten minutes could be shaved off the running time with no visible damage, it's an impressive and irascible debut that rings true even when you're laughing too hard to hear it.",
    "Within the limitations of his bare-bones production, Smith shows great invention, a natural feel for human comedy, and a knack for writing weird, sometimes brilliant, dialogue.",
    "The latest slacker manifesto, Clerks lacks the grunge artistry of either \"Stranger Than Paradise\" or \"Slacker,\" but it's a fast, likable 90 minutes at the movies.",
    "Much of \"Clerks\" is extremely funny and dead-on—in terms of its intentionally satirical, Gen-X-istential gloom.",
    "Even augmented by the priceless commodity of Smith's talent, $25,575 can only be stretched so far. Apparently, it won't buy you a stellar cast - some very strong lines receive some rather flat deliveries. And some distinctly lame scenes survive the chopping block.",
    "Unlike his models, however, Smith hasn't demonstrated that his sensibility reaches much beyond bathroom humor and meaningless drift.",
    "The humor of two clerks arguing about ethics and sex deflates before the halfway mark, but the writer-director, Kevin Smith, dishes up some funny profanity in his low-budget black-and-white debut.",
    "Amateurishly acted, clumsily edited and slapped together out of what looks like surveillance camera footage, the thing bumps along not so much on talent as on audacity.",
    "If not all the gags work, the overall irreverence and all-American anomie are fairly contagious."

My cinephilic friends tend to dismiss his recent works, but this was very enjoyable. I like the influence he has had on independent cinema. 1994 certainly proved to be an important year for it, with the smash successes that independent studios had with 'Clerks' and 'Pulp Fiction'. I hope he sticks to directing films that he himself writes. I have the feeling he wants to expand his horizons but isn't quite sure how to go about it without alienating his huge fanbase. I have great confidence in him, and feel that if he puts his heart into it, he can be a great filmmaker, instead of a good one. I think for him to do so, he could do himself a great service and read a few less comic books and watch a lot more movies, particularly by the Hollywood greats from the Golden Age, such as Sir Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, Raoul Walsh and John Ford. It would be quite exciting to see what he comes up with, once his creative juices are recharged.",

Dante, on the other hand, spends most of the film debating whether to meet up with his ex-girlfriend, all the while being annoyed at the sexual conquests of his current girlfriend.\rWhat makes this film so enjoyable and real is the dialogue and perhaps a little exaggerated situations that these two hapless workers find themselves in, selling tobacco to underage children, having fussy customers, having difficult customers, all in a days work.\rWhere the true comedy lies though is with Randal, whose interesting topic of the Star Wars saga is sheer comedy at its best, simply because its ordinary to think these things, there is no big-budget comedy writer to insert some mediocre quip for cheap laughs, but genuine, albeit ridiculous, scenarios where the best of us I'm sure have found ourselves in.\rKevin Smith, also starring as Silent Bob, a muted drug dealer along with his eccentric pal Jay (Jason Mewes), has created all these interesting and dynamic characters that have chemistry, real chemistry simply because there was little money involved, it was realistic and true. The dialogue is extremely witty and paints a picture of these guys who have to serve you, but they truly know they can do better with their lives. Shot entirely in black and white, the editing is rough and the shots aren't pitch perfect, but thats what makes the film pure genius, because it is close to the heart and full of enough laughter and drama to make every person who second thinks their life choices to step up and take what they want...masterful work.",

Every scene is better than the one before it and impeccably written. The only flaw I have with Clerks is that in some places the humor becomes a bit too juvenile and dirty. Which is strange because most of the time it is one of the wittiest comedies I have ever seen. Dante and Randal's debate over the death of innocent Death Star construction workers in Return of the Jedi was hysterical. But the funniest part of the movie without a doubt was the one line of the correctly named Silent Bob when giving advice to Dante on girls and lasagne. It deserves it's cult status 100% and should have got even more recognition than it did. Which was a lot anyway! Absolutely hilarious and surprisingly sweet in some places.",
