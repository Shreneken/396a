  "critic_reviews": [
    "Passionate and magical, Forrest Gump is a tonic for the weary of spirit.",
    "What a magical movie.",
    "Zemeckis, an undisputed master of film technology, shows off an equal aptitude for vivid storytelling.",
    "Contrasting Forrest's unassuming innocence with the upheavals and rancor of the times, the film is a wisely goofy commentary on the stupidity of smartness.",
    "Manages the difficult feat of being an intimate, even delicate tale played with an appealingly light touch against an epic backdrop.",
    "The results are skillful, highly affecting, and ultimately more than a little pernicious.",
    "A movie heart-breaker of oddball wit and startling grace.",
    "A remarkable balance of sentimentality and harshness, darkness and light.",
    "It's a long drink of water at the fountain of pop-social memory.",
    "This is a captivating experience.",
    "At its best, Forrest Gump is a gentle, elegiac fantasy about love and trust.",
    "Yet, for all that's wrong here, one thing is wonderfully, blissfully right, and his name is Tom Hanks.",
    "Clearly a great event, Forrest Gump is not, however, a great film. It has the form of an epic without real depth or resonance; the trappings of satire without a coherent attitude; and the semblance of historical revisionism without a critical sensibility.",
    "It is also glib, shallow, and monotonous, a movie that spends so much time sanctifying its hero that, despite his \"innocence,\" he ends up seeming about as vulnerable as Superman."

Tom Hanks, really, embodies the character so exceptional! Very well directed too, might say in passing. I can't believe that I took so long to watch this film. I didn't know what I was losing.

The story is there and it is fine, but everything depended on the 1st role actor. I hear often that is is easy for an actor to play an imbecil but I sure doubt that anyone could play it as well as Hanks. At first I did not find the character believable. It seemed to have Hanks in the wrong flick. After like 15minutes of dubbing I found myself totally submerged in the story. A young, stupid boy who somehow managed to live his life with honor and without hurting anyone else. Everything thanks to his mother who loved him so much.  This movie sneaks up on us like we never seen it and a simple little chain of events becomes a huge story of a man and life and what it is all about. Serious, funny and dramatic at the same time.",

It made me look at some stuff in a whole new perspective. Forrest Gump is autistic and the way he sees life and understands it is so  optimistic and different from what we see it like when he's sent with the army to Vietnam and the shooting and bombings begin he goes back to rescue everyone and he is like \"Bubba is my best friend I had to make sure he was ok\" most people wouldn't even have a thought like that and that what makes him so amazing. The movie is charming and fantastic, the actors are great, the scrip is fantastic...

      "content": "\"My Momma always said that life was like a box of chocolates.

Tom Hanks won\"My Momma always said that life was like a box of chocolates. You ever know what you are going to get.\"  Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks)\r Forrest Gump is an absolutely amazing film that was nominated for and won many academy awards. Tom Hanks won the Golden Glove for best actor, and Robert Zemeckis won the olden Globe for best director. Gary Sanise won a few awards for best supporting actor, and was nominated in the same category for a few other awards. It won so many prestigious awards besides Golden Globes too. It truly is one of the greatest and my highly praised films of all time, and it deserves all of it. The film is creative as it gets, and an absolute masterpiece. Part of it's brilliance is how historically accurate it is. Forrest Gump is a perfect mixture of an epic drama, romance, and a drama-comedy. Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a slow-witted man that happens to witness and influence important parts of American history in the 2nd half of the 20th century. Forrest has influenced parts of American history such as teaching Elvis the \"Elvis Pelvis\" dance. His legs were in braces when he was a boy, and he couldn't move them. Elvis was playing a song for him, and he started dancing, but he could only move his pelvis because of the braces. Elvis liked the dance and started to use it. That is the first example of something he influenced in the story.\r The most important part of the story was when he became a war hero. There were a few people that became part of his life that he would influence history with. His friend Bubba who died in the war, who was his best friend he named his shrimp company after. He started the shrimp company \"Bubba Gump\" with Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise).\r Dan had a family member from every generation fight and die in a war, so he feels like that is his destiny. When Forrest saves him he feels like he was cheated out of his destiny. He wanted to die and be honored, but now he doesn't have any legs. He starts to live off of the government, and has lost all faith in God. There is a scene where he is telling Forrest that you cheated me out of my destiny. He was being irrational because it is impossible to be cheated out of a destiny, if God has an exact one planed for you. What Forrest should have said to him is that you are wrong you were destined to survive that war, and in the future you will learn why when all of your pain has passed. I for one don't believe everything is planned. I believe only some things happen for a reason. Certain things I think don't happen for a reason. There is a mix of both, and if everything was planned you wouldn't actually be in control of your life. That is one lesson that Forrest learned at the end.\r The film is also a beautiful romance. Forrest has been in love with his childhood friend Jenny (Robin Wright) ever since he first saw her when he was little. Now that they are adults he wants to be with her, but she is really disturbed. She has become part of the hippy crowd, and she takes a lot of hallucinogens. She gets into many abusive relationships partly because of the damage done from the abusive relationship she had with her father. Her father ruined her life, and everything was sour because of him. She won't be with Forrest because she hates herself, and she loved Forrest too much to hurt him. He doesn't have the intelligence to see that she isn't perfect, or to even see that she is completely flawed. That is the really emotional part of the film, and the romantic part. I like romance in movies as long as it isn't really cheesy stuff, and it is actually deep and emotional. That type of stuff I think is really well acted, and hard to do.\r The film is a hard one to make and to be in, and it is total genius. One of the most creative masterpieces of all time. A classic that will never die.",

It presents you with two movies, and you click which of the two you prefer.  The movies can be similar or wildly disparate, and there are no stated criteria to select--you simply pick whichever you feel is the better of the two, wherever and however that may be.  Since their are no stated criteria, the choice is instinctual and emotional rather than calculated and intellectual.  Forrest Gump is number one on my chart.  Citizen Kane is number ten.  Doubtless, should I ever be asked to contribute to the Sight and Sound poll, I will have a hard time explaining my choices, but that's okay.  I love this movie.  But just in case, here's my head start: 1. As an exploration of the theme of unconditional love, there is none better.  \"You have to stop rescuing me!\", implores Jenny, to which Forrest responds, \"I can't, Jenny.  I love you.\"  Sick, well, degraded, alone, with cads, with child--Forrest loves Jenny.  Period.  He knows what love is.\r 2. It's very, very funny and uses humor to address issues such as segregation and the Vietnam conflict that not only are inherently not funny but that have left deep scars on the American psyche.\r 3. The special effects are fantastic.  Has any movie before or since so effectively integrated news clips the way this one did to give the film its heightened sense of authenticity?  Not to mention the alterations to Gary Sinise, which in my book are way more impressive than, say, what was done in Avatar.\r 4. Maybe this one's a stretch, but it seems to me not incredulous to say the themes of chance and destiny are reminiscent of classical Greek theater and that the soundtrack is not entirely dissimilar in function to that of a Greek chorus.\r 5. And finally, \"Stupid is as stupid does\" works perfectly as a summation of existential philosophy.  After all, who is Forrest?  Is he an idiot?  Or is he a world class athlete, war hero, shrimp boat captain, and millionaire?  Well, it depends on how we define him.  But if we define him through his actions, which is, after all, how he defines himself, it's clear he is the latter.  Throughout the movie, other characters underestimate Forrest, thereby defining him.  The principle thinks he will not make it through public school, yet he makes it through college.  Lt Dan worries he will do something stupid and get himself killed, yet he saves not only Lt Dan but several others as well and becomes a medal of honor recipient.  Jenny thinks he doesn't know what love is, and yet he becomes the great love of her life.\r Okay, I'm waiting for my call from Sight and Sound now.",

Every aspect of this movie shows different points on very controversial moments.  Everything from how Forrest got his name to interracial integration in schools and even touches base on the disease we now know as HIV or AIDS.  Forrest, whose adult actor was played by the award winning actor Tom Hanks, grows up as a special needs child who is befriended by a young girl named Jenny.  Jenny was Forrest’s only friend all through high school and they were always side by side until college when Jenny went on to lead a not so glamorous in life of drugs and all that goes along with it,  while Forrest took the direction of the military.  After the war, Forrest followed a very versatile life of being a Medal of Honor holder, a national ping pong ball champion, a billionaire, a shrimp boat caption, an infamous jogger, and eventually a widowed father to his long lost son from none other than his long time friend and love, Jenny.\rThe movie Forrest Gump can be a tear jerker for many and ultimately hold very valuable points to apply to your life regardless of your situation.  The most commonly known quote from the movie is, “My momma always said, life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re gonna get.”  While many may mock this statement, I do hope they see its truth.  Always be ready for whatever is thrown at you, and roll with the punches.  You definitely cannot plan every detail in life, but as Forrest displays over and over again to just embrace it.  Regardless of his endeavors he was always successful because he gave it his all.  He did not make excuses and took pride in his actions.\rIn my eyes this will always be a “go-to” movie to watch as you can always discover new meaning on scenes that you may have not notice before and really reflect on what America has gone through to get where we are at today.  This movie speaks to you a lot about destiny, mainly from the character of Forrest’s mom, Mrs. Gump played by Sally Fields.  But, it ultimately reinforced by the reality of each and every character in this movie.  Destiny brought all of these characters together and through each event making them into the people they were meant to be.\rI would recommend this film to everyone.  It will always be my favorite movie and just by watching it, it also allows me to step back and re-evaluate my life and where it is going.  It reminds me to be more humble and always appreciate everything I have today, not only possessions, but the people in my life and experiences I have endured.",

The movie focuses on one man's journey throughout many of the most iconic moments in American history. Forrest (Tom Hanks) sits on a bench with a box of chocolates on his lap, waiting for somebody, as he waits, some strangers, waiting for other people or transport, sit alongside him. He proceeds to tell them stories, whether they wish to hear it or not, about how he managed to get to where he currently is in life. We see a young Forrest living quietly with his mother (Sally Field), as she tries her best to raise him, since his father is nowhere around. He does his best at school, despite some of the other kids often making fun of how simply \"stupid\" he is. He wears leg braces as he wasn't fully able to properly function his legs. Growing up, Forrest befriends a girl named Jenny (Robin Wright), who has been kind to him, despite his lack of knowledge. There seems to be some kind of spark between the two of them, but they often go their separate ways after school. We see that Forrest joins the army and meets a man named Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise) who often struggles to keep his patience with Forrest. Forrest ends up becoming an iconic ping pong player, often playing really fast, and he meets President Kennedy, John Lennon etc. all with the power of special effects to make it look as if Hanks' character actually met these people. 'Forrest Gump', directed by Robert Zemeckis (who also directed 'Back to the Future'), is a powerful movie, and tells a story of a kind man and how he remained humble throughout, what looked like, a difficult journey. The acting is solid, the story is engaging, and it is a movie with a warm heart. Maybe too warm for some, but all in all, this is a story that needs to be shared to everyone.",

It's a cultural touchstone with lines like \"Life is a box of chocolates\" appearing everywhere from tee-shirtsSince its theatrical release in the summer of 1994, Forrest Gump has become one of those movies seemingly everyone is familiar with. It's a cultural touchstone with lines like \"Life is a box of chocolates\" appearing everywhere from tee-shirts to greeting cards. The film's popularity was italicized by the way it rampaged through the 1995 Oscars, winning six awards (including the \"big three\" of Best Picture, Director, and Actor). Now, for its 20th anniversary, the decision has been made to do something Hollywood almost never does during the home video era: a big screen re-release.\r How to get people into theaters to watch (or re-watch) Forrest run when it's a lot easier to do it at home? Enter the IMAX gimmick. Calling it anything less crass would be dishonest since there's no inherent reason why Forrest Gump should be bulked up for IMAX (or pseudo-IMAX, depending on how one views the smaller AMC version of the product). Still, commercial considerations aside, there's something majestic about watching this tall tale unfold on a larger screen than one can find in the average family room. The IMAX format is a nice way to entice some viewers to see the movie in a theater while maintaining the original composition.\r During the 60s and 70s, no topic more inflamed the turbulent national consciousness than that of Vietnam and those who were sent overseas to fight. Forrest, as might be expected, has a singular viewpoint on his time spent there: \"We took long walks and were always looking for this guy named Charlie.\" This observation emphasizes the essence of the title character's nature.\r Through the miracle of visual effects, Forrest meets his fair share of famous people - George Wallace, Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon, and John Lennon. While mixing the real footage of these notables with new images featuring Hanks is not a seamless process, the result is nevertheless effective. (This is a precursor of what would become commonplace in future films as the effects work employed here became refined.)\r Forrest Gump has several messages, few of which require much digging into the subtext to unearth. The most frequently recurring theme is an admonition not to give up on life. Why surrender when you don't know what lies ahead? By contrasting Forrest's life with the lives of those around him, and by showing how the passage of time brings solace to even the most embittered hearts, the movie underlines this point.\r The soundtrack boasts a variety of sounds of the era - perhaps too wide a variety. Often, music can be useful in establishing a mood, but Forrest Gump rockets into the realm of overkill. There are sequences when the choice of song is inspired (the use of \"Running on Empty\" for Forrest's \"long run\" comes to mind), but the soundtrack could have used a little pruning. There are times when it seems as much designed to sell CDs as to cement the setting.\r Ultimately, however, any such gripes about Forrest Gump are minor. This is a marvelous motion picture -- a mint julep on a hot summer's afternoon.",

Still, commercial considerations aside, there's something majestic about watching this tall tale unfold on a larger screen than one can find in the average family room. The IMAX format is a nice way to entice some viewers to see the movie in a theater while maintaining the original composition.\r The original review holds up today because, unlike some decades-old motion pictures, this one doesn't seem dated. It wears its age well. Here's what I wrote in 1994 when the movie was first released:\r Ever find the grind of life getting you down? Is the day-to-day struggle threatening to drag you under? If so, there is a movie out there that can replenish your energy and refresh your outlook. Passionate and magical, Forrest Gump is a tonic for the weary of spirit. For those who feel that being set adrift in a season of action movies is like wandering into a desert, the oasis lies ahead.\r Back when Tom Hanks' movie career was relatively new, the actor made a film called Big, which told the story of a young boy forced to grow up fast as a result of an ill-advised wish made at a carnival. In some ways, Forrest Gump represents a return to the themes of that earlier movie. In this case, the main character remains a child in heart and spirit, even as his body grows to maturity. Hanks is called upon yet again to play the innocent.\r A trio of assets lifts Forrest Gump above the average \"life story\" (melo)drama: its optimism, freshness, and emotional honesty. Though the movie does not seek to reduce every member of the audience to tears, it has moments whose power comes from their simplicity. Equally as important is laughter, and Forrest Gump has moments of humor strewn throughout.\r Through the miracle of visual effects, Forrest meets his fair share of famous people - George Wallace, Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon, and John Lennon. While mixing the real footage of these notables with new images featuring Hanks is not a seamless process, the result is nevertheless effective.
