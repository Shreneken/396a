  "critic_reviews": [
    "As the mercenary in charge of liberating hostages from the megalomaniacal General Bison (Julia), Jean-Claude Van Damme finds a showcase for his comic skills in Street Fighter.",
    "It is beautifully shot and the production design is first-rate. Another strong point is the presence of some excellent actors in small roles. Unfortunately, they all have to work opposite Van Damme, who keeps trying to be witty and smart, but still comes across as a bit of a lunk.",
    "For a product of its time — a decade full of video game-inspired stinkers — it’s worth looking back on, especially because it’s obvious how much fun the cast is having.",
    "As Mr. Van Damme fumbles through his part, you are likely to find yourself staring at the big lump on the right side of his forehead and wondering how it got there.",
    "Avid users of the videogame and Van Damme’s loyal fans may embrace the film out of curiosity, but this uninvolving movie will fail to achieve the results of the star’s last outings.",
    "In its noisy, pointless way, STREET FIGHTER does come close to the frenetic meandering of a video game scenario--which is precisely the problem. Video games are always more fun for the players involved than onlookers; consequently, this whole subgenre seems inherently self-defeating.",
    "It's rarely funny when it's supposed to be, and often unintentionally hilarious when it's not. But to be fair, that's not all de Sauza's fault. Some of the dialogue might have been funny had the punchlines not been botched by Van Damme's awkward accent and flat delivery.",
    "A chaotic, juvenile slag-heap of semi-futuristic action that should make at least a few Hollywood idiots think twice about adapting another video game.",
    "What can you say when a video game is more exciting and entertaining than the big-budget feature film it inspires?",
    "If the story isn’t quite incoherent, then De Souza’s klutzy direction renders it so.",
    "It's hard to give a damn one way or the other about Street Fighter -- it's so thin that an errant sneeze might topple this glossy house of cards.",
    "Julia (in his final role) hams it up shamelessly as the camp commandant, but not even his suave presence and throwaway quips can save this noisy, brainless mess.",
    "You should feel sorry for the memory of Julia - whose swansong this is - but actually it's Van Damme who commands sympathy."

Yeah it is mostly a cheesy/hoaky experience with the plot and most of cast can't act well. That being said this movie is really hilarious. In no due part to the main villain. The actor plays it so straight, but the dialogue and delivery is brilliantly comicial.",
