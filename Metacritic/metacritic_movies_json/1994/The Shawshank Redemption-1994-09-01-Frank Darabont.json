  "critic_reviews": [
    "This is simply marvelous entertainment that breathes life into a genre that I thought had been dead for a decade-the prison picture.",
    "In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality: Their small, daily sustenances and minor triumphs are wonderfully inspiring.",
    "A thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since \"The Crying Game.\"",
    "It's the no-bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities. Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving.",
    "Gripping...compelling.",
    "[Darabont] makes you feel the maddening pace of prison time without letting his picture succumb to it.",
    "Remarkable.",
    "At times poignant, joyful, and terrifying, Shawshank Redemption is an altogether brilliant movie and the debut of an equally brilliant director.",
    "Whitmore's Brooks is a brilliantly-realized character, and the scenes with him attempting to cope with life outside of Shawshank represents one of the film's most moving -- and effective -- sequences.",
    "If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.",
    "Some of \"The Shawshank Redemption'' comes across as outrageously improbable. Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil.",
    "A crowd-pleasing story that has little to do with the messy complexities of reality.",
    "Shouldering a laconic-good-guy, neo- Gary Cooper role, Robbins never quite makes emotional contact with the audience.",
    "Speaking of jail, \"Shawshank\"-the-movie seems to last about half a life sentence. The story, chiefly about the 20-year friendship between Freeman and Robbins, becomes incarcerated in its own labyrinthine sentimentality."

The adaptation of the Stephen King novel is so entertaining, filled with interesting dialogue and plot twists. A pretty much perfect prison film. Great performances by Robbins and Freeman. One moment really got to me: the moment when Andy crawls out of the sewer tunnel and stares up at the sky in the rain. Such a glorious moment of triumph, I wanted to stand up and scream \"Yes!\". This movie truly depicted that prison life in the fifties was just as hard for new prisoners as it is implied today. The movie didn't sugar coat Andy's prison life. A great movie full of great writing and performances that the first time you watch it, it will instantly be fortified as a great movie classic.",

Yes, it is better than Lion King, and I really like that too. It is not only enthralling but powerful and movingWarning: SpoilersShawshank Redemption is without doubt one of the best films ever made, and definitely the best film of 1994. Yes, it is better than Lion King, and I really like that too. It is not only enthralling but powerful and moving too. I will confess that I didn't understand it when I first saw it as a lot happens in the film, and I have now seen it three times. I seriously hope, that those who ignored the film when it was first released now recognise it as a great film, as it really is. The dialogue was extremely well-written, with lines that really stick in your mind. The cinematography and music are both gorgeous, and the prison itself is like a character that dominates the film. In the script, there are some true elements of Stephen King Now I admit I am not a huge king fan, and usually don't like coarse language in books. But in his books like It, which is very good, I have accepted the language represents brutality and rebellion, shown perfectly in the film with the battle of acceptance I suppose between the inmates and the superiors(like the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at the new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning.)The acting was exceptional. I am not hugely familiar with Tim Robbins, but he did a great job in a very demanding role. The best performance however, comes from Morgan Freeman as Red, who was seriously robbed of that Oscar, that he lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump. Freeman reminds me very strongly, or his style of acting does, remind me of that of Sean Connery, suave yet very charismatic. Acting isn't just about your vocal range, it's about depth, which was what Freeman certainly had. In short, Freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance. The scene where the inmates are listening to the Mozart aria over the speakers was a beautiful profound moment, and I actually cried in Brook's death scene. Very rarely do King adaptations translate-to screen well, because of the large scale of the author's books, with the exception of this and the Shining. Some like It and Dreamcatcher are genuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from being classed as outstanding. And some, like Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable. In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film, that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long. 10/10 of course.

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nDespite a marvelous start paved with amazingly captured exposure scenes, attractive flashbacks and an unavoidable narration from Morgan Freeman, 'The Shawshank Redemption' sadly manages to lose its main plot into deceptively intertwined sub-plots.Originally presented as a classic film, it ends up being more like a documentary on the American prison system. Surely we closely follow the experience of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), whose performance remains striking by the way, but the scenario tends to incorporate dull and shallow characters. Obviously you are never incarcerated alone, and the omnipresence of others is a point of life in jail you can't miss, but here the movie doesn't even bother to link characters further than the few relations we see them have on screen. It is like if all characters evolved on their own but still achieve to develop a great team spirit.In the end there remains numerous unanswered questions and misunderstandings. All I can say is that director Frank Darabont wanted to be sure we see that Andy Dufresne suffer a lot and withstand many terrible events. That we see him trying to remain upright and honest, tough in his own way. But for what ? His revenge tastes so bland and uncompelling compared to what we see him go through almsot two complete hours ! The ending seems so disappointing and awkwardly dreamy compared to the rationality and coldness of the beginning of the movie, as if the screenwriters had bent over the script and written it all at once, without bothering to add the glue that would have allowed the many pieces of the puzzle to fit together.",

It is the story of Andy Dufresne who is sentenced to a life long detention while claiming to be innocent. Over the years he befriends Ellis Redding a fellow inmate. It is a story full of friendship, emotions and spiritual abysses. I cant spoil anything of the story because this would be a crime. I had often tears in my eyes and cried at the end. I have never seen a movie of this caliber. This is delivered by the great cast. Must I even praise the legendary Morgan Freeman? There is the quote “There is no bad movie with Morgan Freeman” and it is absolute valid. He should have much more Oscars. Then there is Tim Robbins who challenges even Morgan Freeman in this movie. But it did not end here. Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown and Gil bellows are also excellent. Then there is the set. They used the real life Ohio State Reformatory that was closed shortly before. It gives a good scenery and adds realism. I must also talk about the score. Thomas Newman should be praised for his masterful additions that enhance the scenes while also take nothing away. I should not forget the writer and director Frank Darabont because without a great script and a talented director no great movie can ever be made. He put all pieces together. What should I say. This movie is universally praised, it is since 2008 the best movie on IMDb and on nearly all all time favorites list. I have yet to find anyone who dislikes the movie genuinely. Overall this is as close to perfection as possible.",

Probably no, not because the movie was bad or anything, it was absolutely flawless, but because it's always hard to point out one thing as the best ever, especially when you have so many other great works to accompany it. And, in addition, opinions are always subjective. But despite all of that, It was an incredible film, a timeless masterpiece which I feel safe to call one of the best that I have ever seen. It aspires for all the great things, and executes them perfectly. It is a movie that manages to make you see prison inmates, killers, rapists, and other outcasts of society, as complex human beings with feelings, dreams and hopes. It makes you relate to them in certain ways and empathize with them. It is a movie about never losing hope, despite what situation you end up in. To keep fighting for that freedom, that peace, which seems so far-fetched, but that you know you can achieve through perseverance. A true masterpiece.",

But, as I haven't read the original book I will not make any comment on the quality ofThis film is the film adaptation of a Stephen King's novel, where a banker is arrested for a crime he didn't commit and has to adapt to the life on prison. But, as I haven't read the original book I will not make any comment on the quality of the adaptation itself. Its not rare to see films where the subject is prison, justice mistakes or the adaptation to the life behind bars. What isn't so common is to see such exceptionally human films in this kind of environment. And better yet: no exaggeration, no cheap sentimentality.The emphasis is placed on the message that, even in prison, we can live the dream of freedom, that even the most guilty prisoners continue to be human beings. Andrew Dufresne is not a mere banker betrayed by fate, but a deeply generous and humane person, who shows these feelings even on the most painful occasions, and who is able to feel and demonstrate deep empathy for his fellow man. Instead of passing his time mourning his bad luck, Dufresne is concerned with adapting to his new situation and giving his companions the means to forget the bars and maintain hope, the same hope that he also tries to maintain.Directed and written by Frank Darabont, who I think deserves applause for the good work, the film has a very good cast, with Tim Robbins leading the way in the lead role. I don't think I'm exaggerating if I say it was, until now, the best part of his career. Next to him is Morgan Freeman, who gives life to a chronic convict, a specialist in the art of smuggling with a noble heart, who acts as a narrator. Still a word to Bob Gunton, who gave life to the prison director, the big villain of the movie. Acting in a deeply hypocritical way, he lives with the Bible in his hands but does not hesitate to do everything she disapproves of. The technical issues are equally impeccable: I particularly highlight the pleasant photography and the impeccable soundtrack.Named for seven Oscars and two Golden Globes, its almost inexplicable how he came to lose them all. It has always had the critic's support but it was a relative commercial failure, which only proves that sometimes what is made to sell is not good enough to stay for posterity. This film is bound to last as a hymn to hope, freedom and human values ​​we often forget.",

Everything about this film is near perfect. It is an intriguing tale of prison life and routine and how it can affect a man's physique or how you can take advantage of its certain benefits. The film has without a doubt one of the most alluring film protagonists in Andy Dufresne, portrayed by the brilliant Tim Robbins. His subtle yet realistic portrayal of a shy and intelligent banker who is framed for murder is one of the best performances I have personally ever seen. Another character who I can't get enough of is Red played by the unsurprisingly exceptional Morgan Freeman. His outstanding narration sets the mood throughout the film's duration and is simply brilliant. The protagonist's journey from being a vulnerable individual to becoming the most protected person in Shawshank prison is a truly remarkable one. The film is directed phenomenally by Frank Darabont and even more impressive is that this is his first feature film. I strongly recommend that you watch this film as it is one of the greatest films to ever be made and without a doubt my favourite film of all time.",
