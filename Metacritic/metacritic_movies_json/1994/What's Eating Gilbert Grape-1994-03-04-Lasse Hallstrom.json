  "critic_reviews": [
    "One of the most original, appealing offbeat American films in recent years.",
    "Some of the best movies are like this: They show everyday life, carefully observed, and as we grow to know the people in the film, maybe we find out something about ourselves. The fact that Hallstrom is able to combine these qualities with comedy, romance and even melodrama make the movie very rare.",
    "Depp is subtly winning as a man-child oblivious to his own pent-up rage. But the performance that will take your breath away is DiCaprio's. A lot of actors have taken flashy stabs at playing retarded characters and no one, old or young, has ever done it better. He's exasperatingly, heartbreakingly real. This 19-year-old, who shone earlier this year in \"This Boy's Life,\" seems to have a bottomless talent.",
    "Depp puts in a reliable performance as the put-upon son who finds solace in the company of waitress, Juliette Lewis. All three deliver memorable performances along with a strong supporting cast.",
    "Particularly impressive are the sweet, weirdly idyllic tone of Mr. Hallstrom's direction and Johnny Depp's tender, disarming performance as the long-suffering Gilbert Grape.",
    "An offbeat mix of typically quirky elements, and it could have easily been hard to stomach. But the author and director Lasse Hallstrom's affection for these characters shines through. Their greatest asset is the young Leo himself, in his first Oscar-nominated role, bringing great sensitivity and complexity to a part that might have come off as cloying or cynical.",
    "An offbeat, middleweight charmer that is lent a measure of substance by its astute performances and observational insight.",
    "This is one nowhere boy who commands your attention.",
    "Depp is perfectly cast as Gilbert, by turns sullen, quiet, and caring. Depp's expressive face has long been the focal point of his talent, and he uses it to excellent effect here. It's DiCaprio as Gilbert's retarded brother Arnie who may well get the Oscar statuette. He's utterly, tragically convincing as the boy who wasn't expected to make it to ten, much less eighteen years old.",
    "The relationship between Gilbert and Arnie has \"Of Mice and Men\" vibes, but it strikes a responsive chord in a way that the rest of the film doesn't. Most of the credit for that goes to DiCaprio's performance.",
    "The film is heavy on character and atmosphere and light on action, though what does happen is so bizarre as to verge on the ridiculous.",
    "Hallström's finally struck a chord with the Americans, though it's much the same cocktail of whimsy and worry, the eccentric and the banal, that he's been mixing all along.",
    "Juliette Lewis plays the out-of-town girl Depp takes a shine to once he starts getting tired of the married woman (Mary Steenburgen) he's involved with, and while the picture is too absentminded to explain what it is that makes Lewis move in and out of town, she and Depp make a swell couple. There are other rough edges as far as plot is concerned, but I liked this.",
    "The script, by Peter Hedges from his novel, spins out a few too many eccentricities, and the direction, by Lasse Hallstrom (My Life as a Dog), meanders. But DiCaprio and Cates bring loopy authenticity to their roles, and Depp is, as always, a most effacing star.",
    "What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a tad too precious. One of those movies that wants to address life's quaint wackinesses, it's full of characters who are quirky, lonely, bizarre or retarded. There's something intensely earnest about the project. But there's something equally manufactured, starting with the casting of Johnny Depp and Juliette Lewis."

Reilly (of Stan & Ollie fame etc.), who plays 'Tucker Van Dyke' (a local).  I also recognised Mary Steenburgen, as Better Carver - she may be more well known as the mother in the short lived US show 'Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist'. At first this film seemed no more than ok but by the end, I thought it had become really rather poignant. Its a bit hard to review in depth, without giving away spoilers but I'd say its a good film in terms of depicting how difficult teenage carers may find things, when having to look after disabled siblings and parents. There is a sad side to it and there are some mildly amusing moments too. All in all, its a fairly thoughtful watch, one I'd recommend if your interested in the story or particularly keen on the cast then I'd say it's worth seeing, yes. I certainly can't say I've seen Leonardo DiCaprio in quite such a similar role before, certainly.",

This movie is stunning in many aspects, and it creates a world that is anything but unbelievable. I truly felt engaged and enthralled throughout the entirety of the film. All of the characters felt tangible and real and the intertwined sub-plots were handled expertly. Personally, I found an abundance of symbolism present, especially those of biblical orientation. After the film was over, I felt like I had just come out from a tunnel, only then seeing the light, and putting together what I had seen. Leonardo DiCaprio gives an especially believable performance, had I not known prior, I would have truly believed his disability's presence. Johnny Depp was a very interesting character, and the movie worked as quite the character study of Gilbert Grape. The score and cinematography of the film as a whole were thoroughly engaging, especially when it came to the penultimate scene, of the house burning, which was especially powerful. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a compelling if a sometimes slow narrative.",

It feels incredibly dense and I quite enjoyed the ride of emotions. Hats off to all of the actors in this movie, it was pretty well-acted throughout, especially the widow and the mom. Despite being packed with sub-plots through the movie, I did feel that it drug a bit long overall. I also felt that some of the dialogue was awkward, or perhaps awkwardly delivered. I very much loved the ending, how it left things on a hopeful note and up to the viewers interpretation of what happened next.",

I completely did not understand how I began to watch it and why I did it. I did not understand the author's message, but I liked to look at the young Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio played so perfectly in general, so well to play and even in such a difficult role at that age.

I was also very surprised when I found out Leo was playing the autistic child, you would think it would be hilarious but surprisingly he gives a great performance along with Johnny Depp and the rest of the supporting cast. It does drag a bit towards the end but in general the movie is pretty solid.",
