  "title": "Raging Bull",
  "rating": 7.1,
  "release_date": "1980-11-14",
  "summary": "Scorcese recounts the gritty life self-destructive boxer Jake LaMotta (De Niro) who never backs down from a fight on his way to a middleweight title shot.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The performances are riveting and the visuals are stunning. The boxing sequences are brutally realistic - there are no crappy Rocky theatrics here - and the humanity oozes out of every scene.",
    "The most painful and heartrending portrait of jealousy in the cinema--an \"Othello'' for our times.",
    "Another harsh character study, with poignant echoes of \"Taxi Driver.\"",
    "The entire film is played at such high pitch it may well exhaust audiences that don't come prepared. And, at the heart of the film, there is the mystery of Jake himself, but that is what separates Raging Bull from all other fight movies, in fact, from most movies about anything. Raging Bull is an achievement.",
    "Takes a cold, unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring.",
    "This is not a film about boxing. This is a film about the human condition and about cinema itself.",
    "One of the most powerful boxing films ever made.",
    "I can still remember my 19-year-old self's awe at how Jake provokes a gorgeous, reluctant smile from the incandescently beautiful Moriarty. Throughout university, I was obsessed with this film, and watched it about once a month.",
    "Scorsese might never again find a subject as ideal as Jake LaMotta, the Bronx-based boxer whose public bouts and private demons Raging Bull chronicles with such bruising acuity.",
    "De Niro, however, is brilliant and his performance should be a leading contender in this year's Oscar competition.",
    "The film that many consider the finest of its decade, Raging Bull, has aged well, and not just because it was filmed in black and white.",
    "De Niro's performance is one of legend.",
    "De Niro is brilliant, as are the then-untried Pesci and Moriarty, and Scorsese pulls out all the tricks (slo-mo, visceral sound effects, twitchy editing) for a truly extraordinary modern classic.",
    "But when has a performer as fully and uniquely sacrificed himself to the moving-picture cause as De Niro? He leeches LaMotta of soul and conscience, making him a purely physical creature sculpted in sinew for the glory days, then padded up in lard for the declining years.",
    "The use of pop and opera and the black-and-white photography (by Michael Chapman) are exemplary, the actual boxing a compulsive dance of death.",
    "What's most stunning about Raging Bull is the tension between 19th-century melodrama and 20th-century psychodrama, the narrative form brought into being by the conjunction of Freudian theory and the mechanics of the movie camera.",
    "The intensity of the film verges on the intolerable.",
    "But the boxing sequences are possibly the best ever filmed, and the film captures the intensity of a boxer's life with considerable force.",
    "The first hour of the film sets up the situation with a naturalistic vigor and cinematic resourcefulness unique to Scorsese. He knows precisely how to move the camera, dress a set, direct his splendid actors, underlay the music, edit to keep the viewer off guard and consistently impressed. But Raging Bull has nowhere to go but down and out. As Jake follows the trajectory of his predictable degradation, the film threatens to become as bloated and repetitious as the fat ex-champ in his cups.",
    "There is no denying the emotional power of these scenes, but one wishes that Scorsese would end his Italian-American guilt trip and stop exposing mean-tempered, self-destructive characters like La Motta, whose personality problems, he apparently feels, stem from their cultural environment. Raging Bull ultimately has a numbing effect on the brain as if one's head had been pummeled by La Motta's so-called \"girlish\" fists.",
    "As LaMotta, Robert De Niro gives a blank, soulless performance; there's so little of depth or urgency coming from him that he's impossible to despise, or forgive, in any but the most superficial way.",
    "Martin Scorsese's obsession with a dubious mystique of masculinity turns Raging Bull into a ponderous work of metaphysical cinematic bull."

Robert De Niro's tough to the core lightning worthy performance is cinematic history as this epic depicts the rise and fall of the controversial heavyweight boxing champ Jake LaMotta also know as the Bronx Bull.\r Jake LaMotta is at the height of his boxing career in the early 1940s as he pits himself against the toughest boxers to ever hit the boxing ring of New York, however his rage-filled ambition and lack of focus to be the frontline contender is held back when his personal and private life begins to be driven into the battlefield of his inner rage and everything that is his life takes a massive down turn for the worst.\r However even the final outcome still shows us that behind every boxing story is a legendary story about confronting reality with whats left of your guts. Scorsese and DeNiro both did an astounding work to bring LaMotta's career into the spotlight and make it interesting for many audiences alike, (also featuring Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty in their major screen debuts as brother and wife who are treated as heels) its a beautiful film with awesome film editing, graceful score, and a favorable lush cinematography of pure black and white that makes it climatic, suspenseful, dramatic, overpowering and exhilarating and remarkably one of the greatest pictures in motion picture history and a certified classic, not to be missed",

I know why the critics love this movie because it's bold and so vastly different from any other film. You know what that's very true. It is bold and vastly different, but in a VERY BAD way. (semi-spoiler) It's literally just about a douchebag boxer. He doesn't go though a change or journey or anything it just shows his life. He beats his brother & wife. He cusses alot. He kisses an underage girl(well she really didn't look underage) and the movie literally just ends in a random spot. I don't even care about the real story now because he was such a douche.However, he wasn't like an awesome villain douche or anything. It's not like he was the Joker,Hannibal Lecture, or Darth Vader. He was simply a douche that I didn't care about, and wasn't interested in. This movies overrated and people are just saying it's a masterpiece to follow the trend. Well F**k that.

In this case, Jake LaMotta is an insecure piteous brute of a man who knows no better. He does not inspire admiration as athletes in other sports might. The story is not about someone getting somewhere, but about the experience itself, with all the highs and lows, and the final decline.\r The plot follows two brothers as they see good and bad times together as the elder LaMotta challenges this boxer and that during the 1940s. The Mafia who runs the show always seems to have a hand in everything and keep the belt out of his grasp. Jake's obsessive behaviour toward his wife Vickie also makes up the major part of the plot. Her every gesture and remark is taken out of context and exaggerated beyond reason.\r Robert De Niro tackles yet another complicated character for his friend Scorsese. Jake is a whack job who aims big but doesn't know how to present himself. Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci), Jake's brother, is his manager. He is also short on temper but at least he's sane enough to recognize the importance of keeping up appearances and does his best to keep his brother's public image intact. Joe Pesci does a decent job portraying him as a tentative over-shadowed little brother who has accepted his place and goes along with the occasional bullying until it's too much.\r Jake never seems to fully accept his good fortune of getting it on with his sweetheart Vickie (Cathy Moriarty), who he suspects of cheating at every turn. This suspicion threatens everything in his life. At first you might feel sorry for what he has to go through but as his family begins to suffer by his maniac outbursts, you can't help but be sympathetic to everyone but Jake.\r Vickie seems without emotion at first but as time passes some hints of her humanness pass through the filter. Moriarty does a splendid job in making her a sympathetic character even in the middle of the endless hints at her infidelity. She plays her with a laid-back, subtle approach, and feels plastic at times until she shows her quirks occasionally. I admired her greatly, and felt like if a woman carried herself like this, she is bound to have her man, or men in general, follow her around like puppies.\r Shot in black and white, the picture evokes a time when this was the standard. All the details to bring the 40s to life are captured perfectly_ the bars, clubs, cars, dresses and so on. The cinematography was a stroke of genius.\r Raging Bull is not a sports drama. Actually, after the first few fights are shown, seldom is time spent inside the ring. We witness more of Jake's life outside in the world, where he is not hidden under a guise and has to fend for himself. The movie never attempts to explain how Jake became like he did. Scorsese trusts us to derive our own meanings. He just shows us the scenes of violence, love, family and then moves on to the next scene. His touch is light and imperceptible, yet his signature is all over it.\r But unlike his other movies where everything sort of explains itself, I feel like this lacked the cohesiveness of his other works. Scorsese was successful in portraying the experiences of sudden fame and wealth and its effects but it was too vague for me to feel anything. Apart from a few scenes between the brothers which brought me close to tears, other times I just didn't feel anything at all.\r Raging Bull may be more liked than Taxi Driver, but in my opinion it was too ambitious and failed at some level. Goodfellas is where Scorsese eventually succeeded in getting everything in precisely the right amount as they are needed to make a film work. Whether the movie worked perfectly or not is immaterial in the wake of De Niro's performance, and this movie should be watched just for that.The Academy finally recognized his talent and commitment and awarded him the Oscar for Best Actor.",

Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin's screenplay unflinchingly explores what drove this man over the edge and what eventually pulled him back. Scorsese has presented the audiences with the most powerful portrayal of jealousy ever put up on the big screen, reviving the golden age of cinema (at least for a while).\rAs the title suggests, it's not tactics or strategy but rage that drives LaMotta as a boxer. But what's interesting is that his perception doesn't seem to change when he steps outside the ring. He still feels that he has to fight the world on his own with no one in his corner but his brother. Lamotta often destroyed his opponents with a couple of chaotic blows. But sometimes we watch him stand strong, allowing himself to be hammered, refusing to go down. Why? I believe it was his way of confession, it was his way of acknowledging the wrongs he'd done and paying for the sins he'd committed. He hurt everyone around him too much, to forgive himself. Raging Bull is extremely aesthetic and over time, it has come to represent the gold standard in film-making. People can argue that this might be the greatest American film ever made. There's not too much one can say to fight that argument.",

That said, how can you watch a film that is over two hours and every moment of that film, see no likeable characters. No one to root for. Jake La Motta is an incredibly unlike-able character. That is where the problem lies. The 2 is for the music, was with all MS films, it is incredible.\r I have seen this film many times, I might add, over the years, to try to find what people love about it. I've had different versions bought for me as gifts. It is the only Marty movie I don't watch. Anymore.\r The film is so long, it feels like you are going through an ordeal just watching it. It is very difficult to watch La Motta smashing up his wife until she almost dies, watching him lech and rape under aged girls.\r The fact is, this film is guilty of feeding into a myth about famous people being great despite in this case incredible proof to the contrary.\r Also the Black and White does nothing to breathe life into the picture, It just plain doesn't work in '1980' - I know full well that this was done to wash out any glamour from the film, this aim in commendable but making a film about a man who should have been locked up and the key thrown away is not. He must have made a mint from this and for that Marty should feel ashamed.\r Goodfellas for example features a lot of unlike-able people, but it also shows them getting what is coming to them, however we are still able to enjoy some of the glamour that you can appreciate young impressionable kids were drawn to in the first place. The nice suits, the beautiful women, the music, the money, the lifestyle of the rich and famous.

Often referred as a classic by the critics, this gritty drama signifies the director Martin Scorsese's genius on filmmaking and his power on the pop culture world. Calling this film or particularly the character dark, wouldn't be enough. The range or the scale that it grasps in that department effortlessly is what's scary. And that is what the film does for the most part of its time. Surprisingly not in the ring against his opponents but in the house with his family.The fights are just setting up the state of mind, just preparing him for the actual fight that he is going to start so effervescently back in real life. And it is an ugly, ugly game that they fight for. It is not everyone's cup of tea. I might be one of them. I admire the rich visual storytelling gift that Scorsese has. Just take the way he plants the premise of the plot in your head. The love track of Jake (Robert De Niro) and Vicky La Motta (Cathy Moriarty).Now, it is based on an outrageously wrong theme, but we aren't told to go there at all throughout the course of the film. And then when it comes for devil's due, every single wrong deed haunts him back. Which is cathartic for the people loving this genre. While me. I am tired of seeing some con artist or a morally bad person excelling in his or her field only to collapse with his or her built empire. By the way, that sums up half of Scorsese's filmography. Maybe that's why I never connected emotionally with Raging Bull or any of his films, it's not that it is bad, it is exceptional filmmaking, but it's definitely not for me.",

This role is played by Robert De Niro. Jake LaMotta’s wife is played by Cathy Moriarty, Vicky and Joe Pesci who plays the role of De Niro’s brother, Joey. The director of that movie is Martin Sarcoses, producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler.Raging Bull is the story of a boxer, Jake LaMotta, in the 1940s and 50s. After losing a fight for the first time in his career against his opponent, Jimmy Reeves, whose role is played by Floyd Anderson. His brother Joey (Joe Pesci), through one of his contact in the world of the mafia, Salvy (Frank Vincent), manages to make him participate in a fight for the title of champion of the middleweights. Jake is a jealous sickly, violent, unfaithful, especially narrow-minded, vulgar, who has no respect for his wife, Vickie, and is often in confrontation with his brother, often accusing him of sleeping with his wife. He only wreaks havoc everywhere he goes. At times, it seems that his brother is as wild as him, for example when his brother fought in a bar with men who accompanied the wife of Jake, Vickie.I'm not a fan of boxing, but I really appreciate the character, Jake, who played his role so well by his gestures, his voice and especially his glare. Every single time that there was a boxing fight and Jake was facing his opponent it was an “inciting incident”. The major conflict in this movie was between Jake and himself, it looks like he still needed to prove himself something. The images of the film represented the time that the story was happening, especially the black and white. The images of the fights, the sound, making you feel that you were living the moment. Therefore, I find that there were far too much violence and too many vulgar words. In my opinion, the film tarnishes the image of women.In conclusion, the lesson I learned in this film is that you have to balance your professional and personal life, unlike Jake, who made no difference between the stage fight and the world around him.",

First off, I can't not mention that a lot of the dialogue seemed rather mumbled or otherwise spoken somewhat quickly and quietly, which while it may have a certain authenticity to it, I did find it a little hard to follow everything said at times, which is never ideal for me, as a viewer.However, Robert De Niro undoubtedly gives a decent performance in the main role and almost equally so does Joe Pesci as Joey. I quite liked how honest and straightforward Joey was, as a character. I also found myself feeling quite frustrated and sorry for the wife, Vickie La Motta (played by Cathy Moriarty). Goodness knows how many women have been in her position - I wouldn't wish that on anyone.There are, I suppose, some predictable elements to the plot but it felt a mostly well made film, with a clear message in terms of the downside to making a sport your passionate about, the main focus in life. Nowadays there are so many sports films but I know that this one is particularly well regarded. To me, I wouldn't say its one of the best films around but its certainly not bad either. I quite enjoyed watching it to see De Niro as a much younger actor at the time, if for no other reason. Personally, The King of Comedy is my favourite film of his but that's just my opinion of course.Regardless of all that, yes I would recommend this film, for the fact its in black and white and that gives it a somewhat classic type of a feel to it but I wouldn't raise your expectations especially high either.

Jake La Motta (ferociously played by De Niro) may as well be an alien; his cruelty, pomposity and insecurity is powerfully displayed, but is also distancing. We have little background on why Jake is as insufferable as he is; he just IS. Ironically, although De Niro is rightfully given center stage, his co-stars' reactions to Jake are what actually give the film whatever dramatic form it has. Catherine Moriarty and particularly Joe Pesci are effective at providing foils for Jake, but his character's bizarre behavior and unrelenting hostility towards each of them somehow even further distances us from him. Cinema isn't meant to only provide likable, virtuous characters (Henry Hill is similarly flawed, although undeniably more well-developed), but when a film is centered around the redemption of a character, it is important that there should be qualifying characteristics that promote sympathy or encourage the audience to empathize with the character onscreen. It's the absence of these traits that doom Jake's voyage from blindness to self-awareness to nearly complete apathy from the audience. It is significant to note that, at least in terms of the technical, that this is one of Scorsese's most accomplished films, with his confidence here even outpacing his work on Taxi Driver; the score is also beautiful and entirely fitting. One problem may be that Paul Schrader, after making the screenplay of a lifetime for Taxi Driver, was content with making a workmanlike screenplay that takes very little risk and follows a more traditional, less creatively compelling template. Regardless, Raging Bull will endure as a film to study for its impeccable direction; its sensational editing; and its naturalistic, convincing performances. Just don't expect to enjoy watching it.",
