  "critic_reviews": [
    "This remake of the classic Hitchcock mystery is a far cry from its predecessor, lacking the style and subtle humor of the master.",
    "A midatlantic mish-mash with some moderately amusing moments but no cohesive style.",
    "Comparisons are odious, but this remake of Hitchcock's thriller continually begs them by trampling heavily over its predecessor. The original anticipated, with some poignancy, a Europe at war. This version uses hindsight entirely to disadvantage."
