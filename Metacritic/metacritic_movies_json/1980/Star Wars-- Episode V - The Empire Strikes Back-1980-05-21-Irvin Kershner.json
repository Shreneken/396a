    "critic_reviews": [
        "Despite a couple of drawbacks, The Empire Strikes Back is an immense amount of fun \u2014 big and splashy and breathtaking in its display of cinematic genius by a huge group of marvelously talented people.",
        "This second instalment of the Star Wars franchise, directed not by George Lucas but by his former USC tutor Irvin Kershner, is the tautest - an extended ricochet from one incendiary set-piece battle to another which still finds time to attend to plot, pace and character.",
        "A stunning successor, a tense and pictorially dazzling science-fiction chase melodrama that sustains two hours of elaborate adventure while sneaking up on you emotionally.",
        "The best of three Star Wars films, and the most thought-provoking. After the space opera cheerfulness of the original film, this one plunges into darkness and even despair, and surrenders more completely to the underlying mystery of the story. It is because of the emotions stirred in Empire that the entire series takes on a mythic quality that resonates back to the first and ahead to the third. This is the heart.",
        "The storyline is more interesting and ambitious, the characters -- little more than appealing types in the original -- are allowed to grow and develop, the special effects are more mature, and the tone is deliciously dark and downbeat. [Special Edition]",
        "The balance between action and mysticism in The Empire Strikes Back provides fascinating energy. It's as if the kids are given one set of delights, the bravado of battles and elaborate warships zooming through exotic space, and adults are given another, a layered explanation of what it all means in the grand scheme of things. [Special Edition]",
        "The storytelling is the series' best, with a zingy balance of drama, humor, and Deep Thoughts (in a screenplay by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan, directed with confident exuberance by Irvin Kershner). [Special Edition]",
        "Anyone planning to see The Empire Strikes Back should be warned right away that it is done as a two-hour chapter and ends in a cliffhanger, which is likely to leave an unsatisfied feeling, unlike \u201cStar Wars,\u201d which can be taken as a self-contained unit. This acknowledged, the movie nevertheless is a spectacular piece of work that carries the new \u201cStar Wars\u201d tradition forward.",
        "While Empire doesn't quite measure up to Star Wars in the freshness and originality of its script, and the plethora of space operas that has been jamming the screens ever since Star Wars has somewhat lessened the novelty of city-sized ships sailing the stratosphere, nevertheless this 20th Century-Fox release remains a rattling good entertainment, a worthy successor to the original \u2014 and far and away the best of its kind since Star Wars itself.",
        "It was incredible to see what is arguably the best of the Star Wars films, on the big screen again. However, I do not believe that any of the minor changes make the film any better. [Special Edition]",
        "This is the bluest film you'll ever see. The haunting color resounds throughout Empire like a sustained, melancholy chord...Empire is essential viewing for lovers of science fiction. [Special Edition]",
        "In many ways the new film is a better film than Star Wars, visually more exciting, more artful and meticulous in detail. As a special effects wizard, Lucas fairly dazzles the eye with his optical magic.",
        "A darker, richer, and more elaborate film than the original; it suffers most from being just what it is: a middle chapter with no real ending. [Special Edition]",
        "A worthy sequel to \"Star Wars,\" equal in both technical mastery and characterization, suffering only from the familiarity with the effects generated in the original and imitated too much by others.",
        "A cast-iron, self-evident hit, but also just a tiny bit boring, perhaps?",
        "The total effect is fast and attractive and occasionally amusing. Like a good hot dog, that's something of an achievement in a field where unpalatable junk is the rule.",
        "The Empire Strikes Back is not a truly terrible movie. It's a nice movie. It's not, by any means, as nice as \"Star Wars.\" It's not as fresh and funny and surprising and witty, but it is nice and inoffensive and, in a way that no one associated with it need be ashamed of, it's also silly.",
        "Adds more cosmic cliff-hangers than it resolves, and it's not as satisfying as the original. A star war can be an exhausting bit of business, especially when, in the end, it turns out to be something of a cheat.",
        "No, this time out, the \"Star Wars\" enterprise isn't anywhere as enjoyable as the original...One might argue that all this represents a gain, adding to the original, sophistication, richness, depth. But truth to tell, these developments seem little more than inappropriate. To place internal struggles within one-dimensional characters who by definition have no interior is absurd; just as it also seems misguided to take such frothy stuff as the \"Star Wars\" saga and attempt to give it substance and weight.",
        "Mainly it's marking time: the characters take a definite backseat to the special effects, and much of the action seems gratuitous, leading nowhere."

Empire Strikes Back is narrowly the best star wars film, behind it's predecessor. The characters are incredible, none overplayed nor underplayed. This film really set the standard for what a sequel to a great movie should be like. It expanded on the star wars universe immensely, with lando calrissian, the ice planet of hoth, the swamps of dagobah and of course yoda make for the most quotable star wars film in the series. Luke finally harnesses his Jedi powers, which makes for his likability as a character much more involved.\r Perhaps the most compelling aspect of the film is that the good guys are actually challenged. No holes in convenient places in this film. And it doesn't inevitably end with the good guys on top, which films don't risk too often, however this film does it perfectly.\r Starting with a war and ending with a scene on a much smaller scale, the film is still enganging in the scenes that aren't packed with special effects.\rThis film is the reason there were six films and not just an excellent first outing with a terrible sequel.

Star Wars becomes a more serious franchise with this instalment. Some time seems to have passed during which Han Solo and Luke Skywalker have grown as thick as thieves. They now look out for each other more fiercely.\r The conflict escalates as the empire assaults the rebels' new base, forcing them to flee. Luke along with his trusted squadron must engage the enemy while the civilians make their escape. A battle ensues in  which Luke outsmarts several adversaries and then escapes himself. In the disorder, the three main characters are separated from the rest, and from each other. Luke embarks on a journey to learn to become a Jedi knight, an ancient order of knights that was mainly destroyed but still has one member from whom Luke must learn the trade. Darth Vader chases Leia and Han across the galaxy, anticipating their every move. Han and Leia, pursued by the Empire, seek to hide in an unusual place.\r We are introduced to a new character called Yoda, who teaches Luke everything he can to help him fulfil his destiny. We are also shown for the first time the face of the Emperor. A new city is introduced into the story that gets by on mining. It is there the climax of the movie takes place. A duel between our primary protagonist and antagonist takes place, culminating in a line of dialogue that has since its uttering fascinated fans for decades.\r Most of the alien creatures are in costume or mechanical, and are jittery at times. But the visual effects and set design seemed to improve the nearer we got to the end, especially when we get to see the Cloud City.\r Some of the elements distracted me from the story and prevented me from taking the movie seriously. All planets have atmospheres that humans, and every other being there is, can breathe in. Even in space, you can do without a helmet and suit but put on an oxygen mask just to be on the safe side. Mynocks, and one other creature, can live in outer space without the need for respiration. Lucas makes no attempt to show how this could be happening. His disdain for science becomes more apparent. At one point Luke lands on a planet that has snakes and lizards. If Star Wars takes place in a separate galaxy from the one Earth is in, how could our animals be a part of the ecosystem of this alien planet? Lucas should have stuck with his imaginary alien animals, no matter how ridiculous they looked, for the inclusion of earthly animals made me rethink the intro about this story taking place in some other galaxy.\r But you have to ignore serious debate about science fiction if you are to enjoy this film. Take it as you would any fantasy film. As this film expands upon the mythology of the franchise, it becomes clear that that is where Lucas had intended for us to take our thoughts, even if we are to swallow the whole notion of the Jedi and their supernatural abilities associated with the Force. The Force is a mysterious entity that often takes sides in a conflict and bestows power upon  worthy individuals from time to time, but I can be wrong. Because there is Darth Vader to consider. Only Lucas would know the full answer, and he has chosen to use sparing words in order to keep the aura of mystery around it.\r The Empire Strikes Back is the most lauded instalment in the series, and rightly so. It has inspired and influenced many other works in the genre. For that reason it would forever remain in the minds of movie lovers. But if one is to consider it independent of its impact, and choose to scrutinize it with an eye to its value as a piece of art, it falls short in my opinion. Serious work involving logic and reason would always fascinate me more than an adventure tale where the story develops as you go along, and science can be sacrificed at every other turn for the benefit of entertainment.",

While the \"Star Wars\" was honestly nothing much more than pure fun, this one told a dark and intriguing story that really threw its characters for a loop. Since we've pretty much grown to love these characters, the turmoil they face really drives a strong emotional connection that the last one didn't necessarily have. It even digs deeper into the mythos of the force. However, I felt I didn't get enough of it. I wished the second act was much more broad like its first and third acts. It could have added another 30 minutes for all I cared. And really, that's my only biggest gripe. This movie delivers in a way that was never seen before. By putting its characters at stake and giving the story more grit it made for a gripping Star Wars experience. I give \"The Empire Strikes Back\" an A!",

The story in this is the best as it's the darkest of all the films, and really invests in it's theme of good and evil. The fight between Darth Vader and Luke is brutal, and strangely realistic as well as tense. Not to mention it comes with one of the biggest twists in movie history.

Empire Strikes Back managed to break that trend.Empire Strikes Back is, in every way, more compelling, emotionally involved, and dramatic than A New Hope. We get to see each character develop and face new struggles. I would argue that there is no standout actor in this movie. Each one is equal in their ability and serves their character well. Though, of course, James Earl Jones' Darth Vader must be mentioned. If there was another voice coming through the mask, he wouldn't be nearly as memorable.Though I'm normally not a fan of slow starts, this one works in the film's favor. After several important character moments, we get to see an epic ground battle followed by an intense space chase through asteroids. Luke goes on a different path from Han and Leia in this film as he trains with the wise and interesting Master Yoda. Han and Leia have their own struggles as they deal with the foreboding Empire, which is at its best in this part of the trilogy. The movie really starts to shine as the climax draws nearer. Luke and Vader's confrontation, Han and Leia's romance, and Cloud City itself are simply amazing. The Empire Strikes Back's mastery is by no means exaggerated (even if it does mean the other films in the series don't get their deserved praise) and easily one of the best and most gripping installments of Star Wars.Review redone ahead of The Last Jedi.",

But we are spoiled with today and its great effects, and movies are not just about that. Star Wars is about love and many other things that I hope you will love and keep close to your heart. Yes, because this movie still holds up as one of the greatest ever made, and it keeps impress me on every level. Every time I see it.\r Personal Rating: 100/100\rCritical rating: 95/100",

Well, make a sequel of course. This time, however, George Lucas became full-time head of Lucasfilm and could not find the time to shoot the sequel to his acclaimed first movie. As a result, director Irvin Kershner was brought on to replace Lucas and two new writers were also hired: Leigh Brackett & Lawrence Kasdan. The legend goes that Leigh wrote a good first draft of Lucas' story outline, but she unfortunately died in March of 1978 before the script could be finalized for production. This led to Lawrence Kasdan being brought on board to finish up the script and to give it a new approach, also without getting rid of all the material Leigh worked on.\r While Irvin Kershner had plenty of experience as a film maker, this ended up being the first movie Lawrence Kasdan ever wrote or worked on in general, and it just so happened to be a sequel to one of the most famous films of all time. So clearly, he and Kershner had a lot of pressure on their hands. How exactly do you top something as big as \"Star Wars\"? Well, somehow, Irvin & Lawrence not only managed to make a movie truly worthy of being a sequel to \"Star Wars\", but also a movie that completely tops it.\r The original \"Star Wars\" may have a few issues holding it back from being perfect, but \"The Empire Strikes Back\"? F*cking flawless. Most sequels are NOTORIOUS for being poorly written and only made just to make large amounts of money. While Empire did make a lot of money, it had one of the best screenplays ever written, and it's all thanks to Lawrence Kasdan, who would thankfully stick around for Empire's sequel, \"Return of the Jedi\" and also came back to write Jedi's sequel, \"The Force Awakens\".\r The writing is much darker and adds a lot more drama in the mix. Plus I'm sure Lawrence must not of had a difficult time writing this since all these characters were already established in the first movie. The story progresses in all the right ways. We see these characters continue to grow and they're not just thrown into this movie because, \"Hey look! It's those characters from the first film, isn't that cool?\" They all have a reason to be there and you're also just so glad to see them again.\r Han Solo and Princess Leia start a romance. Luke is told by the ghost of Obi-Wan to go to some random planet to learn the ways of the force from this \"Yoda\" character. Darth Vader, who had little screen time in the first movie (though he did make a good first impression), has this new obsession where he's hunting down Luke for some strange reason. Sadly, seeing how iconic this movie is, we all know why he is hunting for Luke. We all know what he wants from Luke. It's one of the biggest plot twists of all time, but if you're one of the few people on this planet who aren't aware of the big reveal, I'll let you watch the movie for yourself. I won't spoil it for you.\r Aside from previous characters returning, we also have new characters. We finally get a glimpse of The Emperor who was partially mentioned in the first movie. We meet Lando Calrissian and he's just as smooth and cool as Han Solo. Not to mention, Master Yoda is one of the greatest supporting characters ever brought on screen and he's a freaking muppet. You can tell he's a muppet, but somehow he's puppeteer-ed and voiced so perfectly that you believe he's a real living creature, and it's all thanks to the talents of Frank Oz with the help of Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Yoda's wisdom and his training scenes with Luke on Dagobah are so brilliant and entertaining. If I needed to just say one reason why Empire is better than Star Wars, my answer would be Yoda, he's such a pimp.\r John Williams returned to compose this movie and like always, he has done a terrific job. I think his score here is better than the first movie, it's so beautiful and adds an extra layer of perfection for this movie. The effects are improved and they're just as spectacular as ever. In fact, they were so groundbreaking that the movie ended up winning a Special Achievement Oscar for its visuals effects, along with winning an Oscar for \"Best Sound\". (and it also should of won \"Best Picture\"...)\r I'd really like that original cut on Blu-ray any time soon, Disney. Seeing how you're going to have full ownership of this movie in 2020...\r If you couldn't tell at this point, I absolutely love The Empire Strikes Back. I do admire the original Star Wars for starting all of this, but Empire helped cement this series for me. This is the heart of Star Wars. THIS is Star Wars. It brings me so much joy every time I watch it. It's my favorite movie of all time.",

The most iconic, memorable and the best of these movies are almost all in this one.\r To me Episode 4 suffered from some severe lack of time for the characters to be properly developped. And also a lot of bad cliches.\r None of that was deadly to it, but it harmed it.\r Empire Strikes Back doesn't have these problems at all, but while the movie is more deep, more emotional, and just all around better and darker than its predecessor, I think the limits of the formula show up by now.\r I still wonder what the \"Dark Side\" of the Force is. I know it comes from anger, hate, and agression, ok, but what the hell does that mean in practical terms? Does it control your mind? It obviously seems to change your personality drastically, so how does it work exactly? I don't even think this is spoiler material anymore, but when it's announced that Darth Vader really is Luke's father, although I think the reveal is glorious, I also get an unwavering doubt that we never really know how he turned to the dark side. And don't talk to me about the prequels, they're making it worse. Even if they didn't exist, the answer should've been in this movie in the first place: does the Dark Side completely change you or not? It seems so, but why? How does it work? All we know is that the Light Side is stronger and that you should focus really hard to feel the Force around you. A little weak maybe?\r Now learning about the Force in depth and Vader is Luke's side of the story in Empire.\r The Solo/Leia side is about not getting totally owned by the Empire because the Millenium Falcon is made out of tinfoil and can't get into hyperspace while the Imperial Fleet is right on his tail.\r By itself it's a great plot basis to build tension, but what happens at the end of the movie simultaneously feels like a cop out and like a dissapointment.\r Without revealing it all, there is a clear announcement that things will turn terribly awry for Leia and Han. And then...it doesn't.\r They just eventually make it through, with a huge snag indeed, but they still make it through.\r My problem mainly with this movie is that despite being the best of the three originals, I get a sense that nothing really happens.\r Big spoiler zone from here on out, but Luke is promised that his friends will die, and they don't, he's promised that he'll fall to the dark side, and he doesn't, There are many times where things should have dire consequences but in the end it all ends up fine. To be blunt, I think the movie would've had a much bigger impact on me if Han Solo died. But instead we get this cliffhanger ending where they promise that beyond the darkest time(Empire) lies the renewal and ultimate victory(Return of the Jedi).\r And I don't know really, there is nothing essentially wrong with this movie, but I didn't feel much from it. And I really think more definitive consequences would've helped. Instead, I get this constant impression that nothing is wrong, yet that nothing really gets my interest.\r On the purely positive side, I love everything about Hoth, from the base to the snowy adventures to the big battle.\rThe scenes about Yoda and Luke, despite showing the limits of how G.Lucas envisioned \"the Force\" still are probably the most classic and memorable Star Wars moments. And several scenes around the end, despite being ultimately a scarecrow with no real consequences, are suitably dark, sad and dramatic. The clunky duel between an untrained Luke and a Vader that is far too gentle for someone we should be afraid of, all of that is possibly the best all of the six movies have ever offered.",

The war between the rebels and the Empire continues, while Darth Vader Luke demand throughout the galaxy. Directed by Irvin Kershner and written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan, this film has the participation of the same actors from the first film.The film inherits most of the qualities of his predecessor. It has a carefully chosen cast and consistent performances, with some emphasis on the work of Harrison Ford, actor who was already highlighted in the first film and now consolidates his success. Action scenes are excellent, thought of meticulous way and the fight scenes with lightsaber remind us some great duels of piracy and swashbuckling films. The special visual and sound effects are the best that existed at the time and fulfill their role with great merit. The only difference between this film and the latest films of the saga is, in fact, this technical issue, given the huge advance that, in a few decades, the techniques and special effects achieved. The soundtrack was again in charge of John Williams, which continues the excellent work started in the first film of the saga. In fact, the first main theme of the chords of the saga became one of the songs that instinctively comes to mind of people when they think of film music, the same way as the \"March of Darth Vader\" has become one of most songs instinctively associated with the image of any movie villain. The point of greatest merit of this movie is the script. It is a deeper script, more psychological and intense than the script of the first film, and this contributed decisively to the success of it, and the franchise itself.

It's pretty much about Darth Vader (David Prowse) making Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamil) turn to the dark side.So, Yoda (Frank Oz) trains Luke to be a jedi knight so he doesn't turn to the dark side.While Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and RD-D2 (Kenny Baker) try to escape from the imperial fleet before it's too late.We later get introduced to a new character called Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), who's the owner of Cloud City and who's also good old friends with Han Solo, we get to see more of his character throughout this movie.Also, the acting from all the actors/actresses are all honestly amazing and they all do a great job in their roles throughout this brilliant movie. There's even a lot of heart and soul with these characters throughout this movie, especially with Yoda. He's got some great quotes which are very inspirational and a lot of them are very memorable.The love and hate relationship, which Han Solo and Princess Leia have got throughout this movie is honestly beautifully shown and it's very great.The dialogue which is given from all the characters throughout this movie is all honestly great.There's so many great comedy moments throughout this movie, either that being a scene where Han Solo and Leia are flirting with each other or it being a scene with Yoda, Luke and R2-D2 being hilarious.I even love how we get to see little sneak peaks to what Darth Vader looks like underneath the helmet throughout this movie, it's honestly brilliant.Finally, the pacing which this movie's got is honestly so good and it's so great for the build ups for certain moments.The cinematography which was shot by Peter Suschitzky is honestly beautiful and he's done a beautiful job on capturing the scenes so well.The score which was composed by the man, the myth and the legend John Williams is honestly so beautiful. It works so well with the scenes it's been placed with, he's honestly the best at composing some of the greatest scores for the greatest movies ever.The action scenes are all honestly great, especially that last one, that one's got some beautiful choreography in it and the music which was composed by John Williams goes so well with it.Overall, The Empire Strikes Back is honestly a masterpiece and a half and it's the best Star Wars movie to this day. The movie's got a brilliant plot, amazing acting from all the cast and it's even got some great dialogue from all of the characters. It's even got some great humour which works very well, some very good pacing, some very inspirational and very funny quotes. There's even some beautiful cinematography, a beautiful soundtrack which was composed by the legend John Williams and some very great action scenes. I'd honestly recommend to watch this one straight after you've watched A New Hope, it's honestly worth the watch.",

But then I think, \"it is mandatory for all children to see the Star Wars films\". And I certainly wont be denying my future children the opportunity to see them just so they can \"understand\" them better. While I enjoyed all 6 (yes, ALL 6 films), I think that I've determined this one to be my favourite. When I first saw it at age 6 or 7, there was a point late in the film where I was terrified of what might come next... The film had such an impact on me, that I didn't watch it again for quite a while. This is a good thing. And yes, I kind of contradicted myself with the whole \"impact\" thing... but that's what Star Wars will do to you.",

This is a more character-driven installment than the previous movie, but still contains the non-stop high energy fun that we remember.\r We see our young hero Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) return after destroying the death star in the previous movie. Little does he know that he has become the victim of the evil Darth Vader's (voiced by James Earl Jones) vicious plan as he has become obsessed with finding him. Luke travels far along to meet up with a master Yoda (Frank Oz) as he trains to become a true Jedi and stop Vader at his tracks.\r Meanwhile, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) attempt to hide in an asteroid field inside Han's Millennium Falcon which is where we see the romantic relationship between Han and Leia growing.\r During Luke's journey to becoming a true Jedi and attempting to stop Vader at his tracks, Vader lets Luke realize why he is so important to him, in a plot point that would count as a spoiler still, but by this time, you'd know what information that is. Luke then tries to escape Vader at every turn, but no matter what happens, something will always draw him back.\r This movie, like I said above, is more character driven than the original, it is also a little bit slower in pace than the original, but you are engaged more than ever simply because there seems to be more at risk here.\r The characters show more emotion and the drama rises, the special effects also improve slightly, offering a dizzying, albeit, electrifying visual experience for anyone who is a fan of complex filmmaking.\r All in all, 'Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back' truly is a sequel to end all sequels, and one cannot help but wonder what other adventure we will see these characters get up to, next.",

The reason why I gave this a 9 rather than a 10 is because the plot didn't have enough of an actual story, but that's all. The greatest thing about Empire Strikes Back is either its world-known plot twist or its special effects. The special effects were absolutely groundbreaking at the time and has aged surprisingly well considering the methods such as stop-motion and puppets. For example, the AT-ATs were the best example of stop-motion effects because it added to the fact that they're robots and they're supposed to move that way. Also, Yoda is the greatest example of a puppet creature in a movie because of the great design that almost convinced me it was real. Definitely worth a watch and deserves a higher meta score from the critics.",
