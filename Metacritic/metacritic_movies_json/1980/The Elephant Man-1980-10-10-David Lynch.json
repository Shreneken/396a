    "critic_reviews": [
        "This is a tale of redemption and transcendence, of the hunchback of London Hospital, of the noble phantom who want to go to the opera, of Beauty and the Beast. In Treves' account, though, the Beast was a Beauty. In Lynch's hands, so is this film.",
        "A marvelous movie, shot in stunning black-and-white by Freddie Francis.",
        "Hurt gives a tour de force performance, masterfully conveying emotions while unable to use his face or even much of his voice.",
        "It is an absorbing and satisfying drama, and Hurt\u2019s Merrick is very powerful.",
        "David Lynch's superb and subtly ironic 1980 film reveals the shining humanity in a horribly disfigured--and horribly mistreated--young man who actually lived in England in the late 19th Century and was rescued by an enlightened Victorian physician.",
        "Hurt is brilliant as Merrick, projecting in his anguished eyes and mournful body language a humanity past the makeup that embodies so convincingly the pain of Merrick, the original elephant man, whose rare disease was exploited by the people running a Victorian freak show.",
        "Hopkins is splendid in a subtly nuanced portrayal of a man torn between humanitarianism and qualms that his motives in introducing the Elephant Man to society are no better than those of the brutish carny. The center-piece of the film, however, is the virtuoso performance by the almost unrecognizable John Hurt.",
        "Lynch\u2019s powerful depiction of Merrick (played by John Hurt) moves a viewer from revulsion and fear to empathy and tenderness.",
        "If you thought the sweetness of The Straight Story was unprecedented in Lynch\u0092s work, look again at this earlier true-life tale of odd, everyday heroism.",
        "I kept asking myself what the film was really trying to say about the human condition as reflected by John Merrick, and I kept drawing blanks. The film's philosophy is this shallow: (1)Wow, the Elephant Man sure looked hideous, and (2)gosh, isn't it wonderful how he kept on in spite of everything?",
        "Despite the rich associations, the film finally makes little more of its central figure, a hideously deformed young man, than an object of pity."

Made in 1980 by director David Lynch \"The Elephant Man\"  is a historical drama movie made in black and white and portrays the life of Joseph Merrick who was a deformed figure and somewhat unwanted by many people yet accepted by many others. In the film we see the struggles, we see love, acceptance and at times it's emotional but also at times nasty but only towards the Elephant Man in a cruel manner. It's a fairly beautiful film and great acting from Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt who plays John/Joseph Merrick aka The Elephant Man who I think was diagnosed with Proteus syndrome in real life but not sure and I think this is what caused his deformity.",

It is also underrated, as it is very difficult to find, and is hardly on TV. The cinematography was beautiful, and the subject matter about a doctor treating a heavily-disfigured man is so sensitively handled I felt I was there. One of the most moving scenes, was right at the beginning when Treves sees Merrick for the first time, and a tear rolls down his cheek.Extraordinary! The scene with Treve's wife is so sad that I had tears in my eyes for the rest of the movie. When he cries, \"I am not an animal, I am a human being,\" I was actually sobbing. i really was. The ending, with the lovely Adagio for Strings(the only time it has been played well) was so poignant, as was the scene in the theatre, with the Tchaikovsky-like music, and Merrick enjoying himself like a 6 year old boy. The music is very haunting, as made apparent in the crowd scene mocking Merrick in the hospital. Don't criticise the beginning, or the end, because David Lynch was trying to create images of pure sadness and inner beauty, and they were very powerful images. As for the performances, never have I seen Anthony Hopkins more sensitive than he was here(well except for the final scene of Shadowlands). His performance was actually one of the main reasons why this movie is so beautiful. The best performance, without a doubt, is the heart-rending performance of John Hurt as John Merrick. Almost unrecognisable, but so magnificent, especially when he recited the psalm without the help of Treves. It is also incredibly difficult to speak with a lopsided mouth, and John Hurt mastered it. Other notable performances are from Freddie Jones, Anne Bancroft, Michael Elphick and Sir John Gielgud. Anyone who gave this a 1/10, what is wrong with you? This is an absolute masterpiece, without question! 10/10. Bethany Cox",

Having said that, a smart adaptation by Christopher De Vore, Eric Bergren and David Lynch is written explicitly offering enough stage and range to each and every character to factor in effectively, is the key to it. And the rest of it is left on David Lynch; the director, whose brilliant execution ups the ante of the feature and enters it onto the major league. As mentioned earlier, the feature scores majestically on performance objective that is fulfilled satisfactorily by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins. The Elephant Man is one of those rare features that happened to have everything in the right place like brilliant execution, stellar performance, perfect editing, amazing background score and above all the simplest yet pragmatic ideology that connects instantly to the audience.",

I had wanted to see it for some time and it lived up to my expectations, with a great, solid performance from both John Hurt as the titular character and Anthony Hopkins, as the doctor who comes across him and does his best to help him.Of course, there are some awkward moments, with Merrick struggling to be heard coherently thanks to his deformed mouth causing him to make quite a lot of sucking and otherwise garbled noises, while he struggles to speak. This may be quite off-putting for some. I can't imagine how anyone couldn't feel some level of sadness or sympathy towards this character though. It's sad how much emphasis society still, even to this day, places on physical appearance. There is some quite touching dialogue. This is a solemn watch, in terms of the themes but its not a visually gory film, with little in the way of actual violence depicted in any real detail. There are some slightly sinister moments but their not gratuitously gory as such. This is a very good film to see, if you want to start a debate about the importance of physical looks in society, I'd say and so I would definitely recommend it.",

Both Hurt and Hopkins are an effective duo, portraying a believable friendship based (loosely) on the real life events of John Merrick during the mid/late 1800s.
