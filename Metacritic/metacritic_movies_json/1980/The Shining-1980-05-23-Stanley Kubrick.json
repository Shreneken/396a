    "summary": "A married couple with a small son are employed to look after a resort hotel high in the Colorado mountains. As a result, they are the sole occupants during the long winter. The hotel manager warns them not to accept the job because of a tragedy that occurred during the winter of 1970. (Warner Bros.)",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "The unhurried pace, extended dialogue scenes and those sudden, sinister inter-titles (\"One Month Later\", \"4pm\") contribute to the insidious unease. Nicholson's performance as the abusive father who is tipped over the edge is a thrillingly scabrous, black-comic turn, and the final shot of his face in daylight is a masterstroke...Deeply scary and strange.",
        "A masterpiece.",
        "With remarkable visual panache and a keen sense of irony, Stanley Kubrick rehabilitates Stephen King's trashy, terrifying novel. Not a horror film in any traditional sense, but a perversely comic, occasionally frightening melodrama of intrafamilial rage, THE SHINING retains the Oedipal structure of King's narrative while running rings around its pulpy sensibility.",
        "The Shining buzzes madness and malevolence from every frame.",
        "But there is no way, within the film, to be sure with any confidence exactly what happens, or precisely how, or really why. Kubrick delivers this uncertainty in a film where the actors themselves vibrate with unease.",
        "Ostensibly a haunted house story, it manages to traverse a complex world of incipient madness, spectral murder and supernatural visions ...and also makes you jump.",
        "Who would have ever thought to pair up Stanley Kubrick and Stephen King? But weird as it sounds, this creepy thriller works.",
        "The Shining is terrifying for what it doesn\u2019t do.",
        "Meticulously detailed and never less than fascinating, The Shining may be the first movie that ever made its audience jump with a title that simply says \"Tuesday.\"",
        "For a supposed mainstream movie, Kubrick\u2019s The Shining isn\u2019t very audience friendly. Half the time you have to guess what the hell is going on, and if you're not familiar with Kubrick's narrative style you\u2019ll be completely lost.",
        "It\u2019s the experience more so than the actual content of The Shining that radiates cold, anti-humanly indifferent terror.",
        "Despite its deliberate pacing, it moves quickly, in large part because of the extraordinary way that Kubrick builds and deepens the sense of dread. Even seemingly normal and innocent moments - such as Danny tooling around the corridors of the hotel on his Big Wheel (with the sound of the wheels echoing on hard wood and muffled on carpet) - are overshadowed by an encroaching sense of the ominous. Technically, The Shining may be one of the most perfect motion pictures I have seen. It's too bad that the same level of excellence doesn't extend to the performances and screenplay. The Shining is well worth experiencing, but it does not rank as a member of Kubrick's top echelon of cinematic achievements.",
        "Stephen King reportedly loathed the liberties Kubrick and co-writer Diane Johnson took with his story, but King's ur-villain, the emasculated husband from hell, has never been more clearly presented on-screen.",
        "There are moments so visually stunning only a Kubrick could pull them off, yet the film is too grandiose to be the jolter that horror pictures are expected to be. Both those expecting significance from Kubrick and those merely looking for a good scare may be equally disappointed.",
        "It is a daring thing the director has done, this bleaching out of all the cheap thrills, this dashing of all the hopes one brings to what is, after all, advertised as \"a masterpiece of modern horror.\" Certainly he has asked much of Nicholson, who must sustain attention in a hugely unsympathetic role, and who responds with a brilliantly crazed performance.",
        "The opening scene of The Shining is along a narrow mountain road while the \u201cDies Irae\u201d plays ominously on the soundtrack. The camera veers out away from the car toward the horizon as if to bear down on something significant\u2026 and then comes back to the car. The movement is a sort of portent for the direction of the movie, which takes two and a half hours to go nowhere.",
        "The crazier Nicholson gets, the more idiotic he looks. Shelley Duvall transforms the warm sympathetic wife of the book into a simpering, semi-retarded hysteric.",
        "Kubrick is after a cool, sunlit vision of hell, born in the bosom of the nuclear family, but his imagery--with its compulsive symmetry and brightness--is too banal to sustain interest, while the incredibly slack narrative line forestalls suspense.",
        "Stanley Kubrick's production of The Shining, a ponderous, lackluster distillation of Stephen King's best-selling novel, looms as the Big Letdown of the new film season. I can't recall a more elaborately ineffective scare movie. You might say that The Shining, opening today at area theaters, has no peers: Few directors achieve the treacherous luxury of spending five years (and $12 million-$15 million) on such a peerlessly wrongheaded finished product."

It's not a jump-out-at-you scary movie. What it does do well is creepiness.\rThe first time I watched it I was pretty underwhelmed. It was one of, possibly the only Kubrick film I'd seen that didn't deliver on my expectations. Often a Kubrick film will go above and beyond my expectations. However the more I thought about it, and after watching it a second time, and watching the documentary Room 237. My thoughts on the film have become much more positive and enthusiastic. In a lot of aspects this is some of Kubrick's best work ever. The carefully thought out shots. The way he creates such isolation and hostility for the viewer. You're off in your own world in the Overlook Hotel. Jack Nicholson is fantastic in it. The music in it is very good and effective to adding a whole extra level to the movie. And it'd have to be the most mysterious Kubrick film ever made. Even more than 2001. There are so many questions you'll be asking about this film. The ending won't solve all your questions; it'll add more. You could interpret this movie from so many angles. If you become intrigued in this film even after you watch it, go on the internet and look at the various interpretations and things the film had that you probably missed. This film still remains a mystery three decades on, it's not a total crowd pleasing film but if you're interesting it's definitely worth a watch.",

Jack did awesome work, he laugh and he's angry in same time, change many faces in one scene so we can actually read his mind, which is pretty cool. Kid was pretty awesome too, one of best kid acting i saw lately in horror movies. But, i dnt think this is horror, it's more like drama. There was few really long scenes, that dnt really need to be that long. Anyways, worst thing about movie is music. You cant focus on scene because you need to take off your headphones because music become too loud on some scenes, and music is just random and weird, i really didn't liked that part. Not to mention that black guy traveled a lot to get one hit in chest after he just walked in hotel lobby. Pretty lame, he got involved in story too much, and he didnt had even one line when he arrived at hotel.",

The cast does a good job, certainly Jack Nicholson as John Torrance and Shelley Duvall as his wife, Wendy. I can understand why this is regarded as a classic horror film, with both of their performances being quite memorable. Wendy's look of sheer terror when things come to a head is quite chilling and certainly memorable, as is Jack's when he embarks on the infamous rampage.If your a fan of horror films and the like, then I'd definitely recommend this film.",

Given the sheer brilliance of what it had to work with, and the immense talent attached to it, the film should have turned out to be far more than what it was: a disappointingly basic and stunted \"chiller\" does not do any semblance of justice to King's masterpiece. It lacks any form of suspense, thrills or chills, manages only to be slightly and sporadically unnerving. \"Here's Johnny\" and \"Room 237\" are memorable vignettes.

King himself has been vocalStanley Kubrick's The Shining is a fascinating movie. Both in content and in history. Based on the Stephen King novel, this now horror classic was met with some not so great reception upon it's initial release. King himself has been vocal about his lack of satisfaction with the changes made to his source material. Saying how some it's important themes were missing in this adaption. Yet, today it stands as one of the most celebrated films in horror. Interesting indeed.\r It's not hard to see why it's so celebrated today. I just find it hard to wrap my mind around why it's legacy is now so different than how it was viewed upon creation. Well, enough of that. Time to get on to the actual review.\r The Shining stands as an excellent example of how to build up tension. It's odd moments and slow pace add a sense of believability to the mix that make it all the more compelling. The tale itself is filled with many mysteries to keep viewers engaged. The cast is pretty darn excellent.\r The movie is worth watching for Jack Nicholson's performance alone. We all know Nicholson can play a crazy person with ease. It's his ability here though, to play a complete nutcase with moments of sheer lucid madness, that really sells the whole thing. There are moments where Nicholson's character is clearly out of his mind. Yet, there are other dispersed in where he appears to be totally in control of his own thoughts. Well aware of the consequences and moving forward anyway with only the slightest bit of manipulation. It's these moments where he comes off as the most menacing. He's a very charismatic psychopath.\r The supernatural elements are where the real madness comes from. Psychic powers, ghostly visions, and otherworldly entities at play leave plenty for you to dwell on. They also may leave you with a few frustrations. I know they did for me at least.\r There's plenty going on here that is oh so very vague. Some stuff is left open to interpretation, which isn't exactly a problem. There are however important elements of the plot that just don't get touched on. For example, what's the story with the boy living in Danny's mouth? It's pretty darn significant to the plot. Yet, we're given next to no information about it. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't tied directly to some of the movie's most important moments. The lack of any sort of insight had me wanting to tear my hair out in frustration at times.\r That's really the only issue I can find with it. The Shining is simply a great psychological horror-thriller. One filled with odd moments, compelling drama, and a stunning central performance from Jack Nicholson. It stands one of the most interesting films I've ever watched. One worth searching over multiple times to pull out new secrets. Even if you aren't the type to really dive into analyzing films, it's a great horror film on it's own. Perhaps not a very scary one, but still filled with enough mystery to make for a gripping ride. One with plenty of tension.\r 8.7/10",

Viewing 'TheMy first viewing of Stanley Kubrick's classic 'The Shining' left me somewhat...underwhelmed. As a 15 year old boy, my underdeveloped, action oriented brain, desired gore and cheap thrills...something that this film avoids. Viewing 'The Shining' as an adult however, was a truly unforgettable experience. So here are my two cents.... Hearing the term 'adaptation of a Stephen King novel' makes me want to vomit. With such duds as 'Storm of the Century', 'Rose Red' and 'Tommyknockers' falling within this category, I was sceptical. But thankfully, Kubrick diverts drastically from the source material, playing down the supernatural elements of horror. The fear of the characters' deteriorating mental health, and the potential of what they could do to one another, is far more terrifying than the threat of ghosts. This makes for a human, relatable, and intelligent horror; more frightening than the typical ghost story. Kudos to the screenwriters for taking a chance. Like most Kubrick films, the performances are strangely enigmatic. Shelly Duvall's portrayal of the seemingly 'desperate to please' Wendy, was irritating in the initial stages of the film. There was a self-consciousness to the performance, that felt slightly superficial. HOWEVER, when the hysteria sets in, Duvall delivers the goods. She is chillingly authentic, and utterly electrifying. It actually heightens the experience in the final third of the film. Apparently Kubrick was a prick to her on set in order to 'push her' into that place...so thankyou for that! It's magic. I find Jack Nicholson a difficult actor to really warm to, and his performance here is no exception to that. It's over the top, comical, frightening...and unpredictably mad. I think I would have preferred Jack Torrance to be a more likeable character in the developing stages, but nonetheless, he is fascinating. And Danny Lloyd would have to go on the list of 'best child performances ever'. The facial expressions, body language, and the eyes, are completely believable and nuanced! They struck gold with him. Typical of Kubrick, the film is a visual spectacle. Even by todays standards, the cinematography is mesmerising - a testament to Kubrick and John Alcott. Visually, the film is so absorbing. The camera rarely stops moving, in inventive (but non-distracting) ways. There is a sense that the characters are being watched by 'another presence' that is constantly tracking their movements. The camera work is subtly unsettling. It is so refreshing for a modern audience to watch a film like this, that relies on a slow and contemplative build up, and resonating images for scares. There is a genuinely creepy tone throughout, and the climax absolutely soars with thrills. And, strangely enough for this genre, 'The Shining' gets better with every single viewing. A well deserved classic!",

Torrance's intension is to use the remote and isolated hotel to find peace while he is writing, but as he get's into his writing his mental state starts to change.\r From the majestic and long opening scene where the camera moves transversal through a dead silent landscape and towards the films main location, to the grand finale, this is a throughout captivating and mind-puzzling tale mostly seen through the eyes of a psychic young boy who receives frightening premonitions about the place his parents have brought him to and a grown man who unknowingly is faced with his own mind's evanescence. This increasingly chilling character study uses repeated imagery, shifts from regular to extreme close ups, concentrated, repetitive and no dialog whatsoever, short and long takes and frequently changes from scenes of eerie silence to scenes of climactic noise.This is the type of film such as, without making any comparison, Peter Weir's \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\" (1975) or David Lynch's \"Eraserhead\" (1976), where the mood is crucial for the films atmosphere, and in this case the mood is composed by Jack Nicholson's versatile mood-swings and the classic and orchestral music.\r Several stories are intersected in \"The Shining\", and they differ from the story of a writer's block, a horrible tragedy that happened in the past, a wife unable to reach her husband, a son unable to connect with his father and a man's broadening psychosis. It's impossible to overlook Jack Nicholson's electric presence as he transforms into a character that bewilders himself as far as conceivably possible in an oblivious mind. His multi-layered performance stands as a milestone in acting and Nicholson is as frightening as he is entertaining in his nearly exaggerated interpretation. With that said, this film wouldn't be as good as it is without the performances of Shelley Duvall, Scatman Crothers and Danny Lloyd, who's presence is just as effective as Nicholsons. The ingenious about \"The Shining\" is that it achieves a high level of tension without being overly violent. Yes, there is a flood of blood, but the greatest horrors of the film is the words, the sounds, the images, the faces, the moods, and how these cinematic elements spark the viewers imagination. This inner an outer mind maze is a vivid examination of supernatural spookiness that truly captures the feeling and perception of fear. Kubrick knew no boundaries as a film maker and his eleventh feature is photographically aesthetic and unflinchingly directed.",

I've only seen one of Stanley Kubrick's other films, which was 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and if you think that Stanley Kubrick only makes those kinds of films, think again. This brilliant man takes mastermind Stephen King's already-horrific novel and crafts it into his own ingenious, twisted work that is probably more frightening than the book itself. And there's Jack Nicholson, who does an outstanding performance as psychopath Jack Torrance. When I saw this film, my immediate thought was that Nicholson's character was just as I imagined Torrance's personality while reading the source novel. It's possible to admit that sometimes Jack Nicholson does go a little loopy with his role, making it often seem more like his role as the Joker in BATMAN nine years later, but he never seems to go overboard, and his character always enhances the eerie-ness of the entire film. All in all, THE SHINING is a must-see. It's certainly not one of those \"spewing guts\" films where everything is grotesque blood and gore. Instead, the horror comes from the creepy, sadistic, intense mood, as this is a well-molded psychological horror. Add this to your shopping list (or your renting list) if you haven't seen it.

His books are incredible, the films tend to be....meh (no, Green Mile and Shawshank you are in a different category altogether). Firstly, I think 'The Shining' needs defending. For one, it was made in 1980 and as such there are certain technicalities that are just simply unfair to compare to films of 2012. What this film does do incredibly well is make the audience afraid of something realistic and plausible (i.e. this extreme reaction to isolation) without using cheap jump scares like so many more modern horror films rely on. The reason for 7/10 would mainly be because I felt that Jack Nicholson, as brilliant as he is, was made to be a pretty unsettling character right at the start of the film whereas in the book, the main 'scary' aspect of it is that it's a slow decline and as such, you start to feel the strain. The book would be 10/10, I just felt like this film didn't make the most of certain aspects of the storyline. Bottom line is, it's not scary to a 2012 audience. The concept will always be unnerving but it's very unlikely that you'd walk away from this film genuinely scared simply because of how much more extreme horror films have become. However, it is a classic film, there are hundreds of good things to say about it I just think it needs to be watched as a piece of horror film history instead.",

It got much to tell about the nature of the human self, and its humanitarian aspect like insanity, supernatural phenomenons and obsession. It's also extremely well written and visualized. But it's boring, and  less entertaining throughout the whole movie, most of the time. The acting is another aspect, and Shelley Duvall is such a horrible actor. But Jack Nicholson is flawless. So it's an overall boring and slow movie, but that got some scary moments. But it never felt like all the build-ups really payed off, and the climax never comes. But the ending was kinda plot-twisty so it was great! But it's still a boring and slow horror-flick.\r 6.8/10",

Technically speaking, this is a flawlessBased off the legendary novel by Stephen King, Stanley Kubrick's \"The Shining\" is a classic horror film with an excellent portrayal of what happens when an individual loses their touch with reality. Technically speaking, this is a flawless movie. However, \"The Shining\" does lose some points for two reasons: The flawed acting by some characters, and the obvious fact of Kubrick deviating from the novel.\r Despite the blatant flaws, it must be noticed that \"The Shining\" has many things going for it. For example, everyone knows the front cover of the film and the exact scene that is displayed. Needless to say, \"Here's Johnny!\" is the most recognized quote from the film, and is argued by some to be more legendary than when it was said by Ed McMahon. Beside the legendary quote, the biggest pro \"The Shining\" owns is that it is seemingly a perfectly executed technical movie, such as the great use of lighting at certain parts and how Kubrick was able to make every shot important and relevant. On a deeper note, \"The Shining\" has a very dark overlying tone throughout the movie which, personally, is an essential in any great horror film. The evil, sinister music that can be heard periodically throughout the film only helps in establishing its dark tone.\r On the other hand, despite the seemingly perfect directing, Kubrick is let down in a very disappointing way. As beautifully directed as this film is, it is only right for Kubrick to be given flawless acting. Sadly, this is not the case. Presented to the viewer is the laughable, embarrassing, and seemingly effortless acting, especially by Shelly Duvall, with the prime exception of Jack Nicholson. However, it is an even bigger disappointment that Kubrick let the audience down with his defiant variation of the novel. While the film is good and worth the watch, it would have been nice to see how it would've looked if he had stayed truer to the book, much like \"A Clockwork Orange\".\r All in all, \"The Shining\", while having some slight disappointments by the actors and director, comes up as a victory for cinema, and is definitely worth the watch. 7/10",

But despite the fact that Kubrick's screen writing made the movie not so good ( i heard that he read the book , well if he read the book he might understand the characters more better).  Stanley Kubrick    has a film makers eye with a hundred percent talent. but his version isn't enough for the book. Cast worth it the cast did a better job then Kubrick. Grade A-",

And that's coming from someone who scares very easily. I do, however, appreciate that films that were once very frightening become less so over time (cough, cough, \"Alien\"!).\rJack Nicholson's portrayal of a man's slow descent into 'cabin fever'-induced madness was amazing. Having said this, however, there just wasn't enough normality in his character to begin with. He already seemed a rather grumpy, impatient man.\rShirley Duvall was awful at playing Wendy. She was too flouncy and pathetic - if your child was being chased round a maze by a man with an axe, you'd be a little more ... 'badass', surely - if you pardon the pun ;-)\rThe film wasn't NOT scary. I was on edge a few times, and freaked out utterly at one scene in particular. The acting in this film was very well done - mostly on Nicholson's part, and Danny Lloyd's. It's not that Shirley Duvall did a bad job. Her character just didn't do justice who I had in my head.\rBut in spite of my highly critical review of this film, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was left wondering what the last scene really meant - no spoilers, sorry! - and thinking about the story for hours after it'd finished.\rWell done, Kubrick, a wonderful adaptation.",

IT IS ONLY OFFICIALLY A HORROR MOVIE. I watched this when I was 12 years old, and I wasn't scared at all! One thing that might've made it less scary, in my opinion, was that it wasn't some kind of serial killer. Only one family was really being haunted in one specific hotel, and it was extremely unlikely to happen to any random person at home. A popular opinion that I agree with would also be the acting. Jack Nicholson did pretty well, but, even though he's supposed to be deranged, sometimes it seemed as if he was too crazy to the point it was annoying and/or unnecessary. The wife was terrible, though. She cried like she just had strong hiccups, her screams were a bit unrealistic and annoying, and she was just overall, a bad actor. Nobody else was great or bad. The storyline was okay, as it was simple, but showed how isolation changes you. The storyline itself was not very creepy, and lacked depth, too. In the end, I give it a 7. I personally value it a little less, but I think the actual quality of the film was better than in my opinion.",
