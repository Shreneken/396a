  "title": "Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas",
  "rating": 1.2,
  "release_date": "2014-11-14",
  "summary": "Kirk Cameron is enjoying sister’s annual Christmas party until he realizes he needs to help out his brother-in-law Christian, who is chock full of no-fun Scroogery. Kirk realizes it’s his job to grab Christian by his seasonal sweater and show him Christ where Christ has always been: smack dab at the center of all the Christmas hoopla.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Beyond the leaps in logic, the most troubling part of this film is that it just feels like a defense of the excess of Christmas.",
    "Saving Christmas will hold little interest for anyone not already a believer. It’s too single-minded in its instructional purpose, too averse to multidimensional characters, too youth-pastor-like in its dorky humor.",
    "Saving Christmas seems determined to win any perceived war on Christmas through brute force.",
    "A glorified infomercial in defense of the holiday that contains about 15 minutes of actual content padded out with almost an hour of filler.",
    "Every holiday season sees a new influx of Christmas movies desperate to become the next big seasonal perennial destined to provide laughter, tears, humanity and healthy residuals for years to come.",
    "This may be one of the least artful holiday films ever made. Even devout born-again Christians will find this hard to stomach.",
    "An unholy mess co-produced by Cameron's faith-based Camfam Studios.",
    "Preaching aside, though, Saving Christmas is a shoddy 80-minute feature that contains approximately 50 minutes of actual moving footage. When Cameron narrates that materialism doesn’t go against Christmas because it celebrates the son of God being made material himself, it sounds like a defense of any kind of cheap, poorly made holiday crap — this movie included.",
    "Director Doane offers no storytelling pizzazz; the lighting is careless, the pacing is deadly, the occasional stabs at comedy fall flat. Ultimately, Saving Christmas has nothing to share that Linus Van Pelt didn't already say better on “A Charlie Brown Christmas.”"

The only reason I know about this movie is because my grandmother posted about it on her FaceBook page. I watched 15 minutes of it and I think I saw enough to make as good a critique as anyone could.\rThe thing about Kirk Cameron is that that he has neither the directing, writing, or acting skills to make decent snuff film so I don't think anyone was expecting anything more than a good laugh if it failed badly enough. Unfortunately for those of us hoping to find chuckle or too: there is no laughter to be had here. I mean AT ALL. I've seen funnier Werner Herzog films. The humor in this movie is physically and psychologically tolling. The plot makes me think he didn't even try. And, If I didn't know better, I would think he had never actually heard of Christmas and had kind of Wikapedia'd it five minutes before writing the script.The incompetency on display throughout this movie would be astonishing if anyone else had made this film, and the pandering to the narrow-minded right is about as obvious as Kirk Cameron is relevant.",

Normally I'd bash the terrible comedy, bad camerawork and lame script (trust me, I still hate them.), but it's the message in this movie that makes me want to attack Mr Cameron with a sharpened candy cane. The fact that there's apparently a 'wrong way' to look at Christmas is just narrow-minded and borderline offensive. What if we don't want to treat Christmas like the greatest day ever? What if we don't want to ignore the bad parts? I always saw Christmas as a season of mixed feelings personally. A confusing time where we don't always know how to feel. The Charlie Brown Christmas Special absolutely nailed this message and that was made in 1965. A good 49 YEARS EARLIER! Y'know an article on Kirk Cameron's website said that Atheism is founded on fear and prejudice. After watching this, I believe I've found a greater source of fear and prejudice. Fear that rational minded people are finding entirely logical flaws in your holiday and using prejudice to force them to change their ways. Please Please PLEASE do not watch this movie!",

Now, I am a devout Christian.\r Kirk's message about the true meaning of Christmas just made me realize the narcissism of my own heart and what a mindless consumer I was like everyone else--especially during the holiday season. Even as a churchgoer for many years as a kid (because of my parents) I never truly felt the presence of God in any special way. But the way Kirk described the Christmas story...he just paints such a vivid picture of the life of Jesus, and how we're all broken people, how we all need forgiveness. I can see all the negative reviews this film is getting--but I don't care. It brought me to my knees and I can safely say I will never look at Christmas--or life, for that matter--the same way.

He couldn't sin at all, and He was tested at all points, and still did not sin at all; He (Christ/Messiah) was beaten, Crucified on a Roman built Cross, died, covered in swaddling clothes, then buried for 3 days and 3 nights, and rose again (Resurrected).\rWhy did He (Jesus Christ/Yeshua Messiah) do this? He did it for you, for every man, woman, and child is born a sinner because of Adam in the book of Genesis sinned, and we inherited this sin nature. This is what the movie is really about! It's about the Gospel, that Christ died for sinners! People who say 'Christmas is pagan', need to watch this movie, and then go back to the Origins, from the book of Genesis, whether's it's in your Torah or Tanak, New Testament, Gospels, History, Apostolic Writings, and/or Bible.\rThis movie is really a commentary of Biblical History, and that you can still receive Salvation for your sins, and that you can be a child of God through Christ's Blood Sacrifice (The Perfect Lamb of God, Old Covenant typology).\rThe media in news and movie reviewers view \"evil is good\", and \"good is evil\", and view this as the \"worst movie ever\" (in reference to Saving Christmas).. Really, it's the worst movie ever? Are you sure?\rWhat about James Cameron's Titanic, which really wasn't about the Titanic? I mean, you see the Titanic here and their, but it's about adultery, if you understand the term and it's origins: engagement, and it really means = to be married.\rWhat about Michael Bay's Transformers (2007)? You get the Transformers with very few lines to them (robot characters), and the lines are given to an actor and an actress, who are unknown until this movie came out. I felt like I was watching a cross-between Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure and Clueless (which I can't recommend either movie). I would hear from people in my area, that it was \"a good movie!\" and \"Megan Fox is hot!\", and in translation: \"Good special effects, hot girl, and no substance to the story at all.\" Is their such a called movie plagiarism? It would apply to this particular movie!\rWhat did these two do, along with other movies who fall hard in Hermeneutical and Exegetical (Science and Art of Interpretation, letting the writer(s) speak for themselves, and having good application to what's being written/said) standards?\rIn the fiction historical background, and non-fiction (literal history) accounts who fail to follow manuscripts that is it's history, and it fact, people get praised to doing something that receives an F-, and get ridiculed for A+ when it comes to movies, documentaries, and commentaries. It's really: \"Let's apply A+ to Ivy Leagues with their buy-out program\" and \"Let's apply F- to who understand True Interpretation of things.\"\rIn today's society and since the 1920s-1930s, the view is: \"reject it: if it convicts us, you need to a full 180 in your so-called life style (it's really a death-style), corrects these forms of so-called theologians views (nazists, fascist, communists, socialists = aka liberal and moderates), has True Supernatural substance to it, and it's True Historical accounts, it doesn't do my homework (research) for me\" which Saving Christmas actually does.\rYep, you get to your homework (research) on this Bible Commentary, Bible History, and actually documentational History (do Origin Source Research)..\rWhile the majority of society (not just in North America) embrace superficiality (i.e. Transformers, Titanic), and reject Hermeneutical and Exegetical standards, and perform Exegesis (let's take a mass amount of liberties, and give a folklore, myths, add deceptions here and their), and it does my homework (research) for me. It's: \"Oh, I don't have to my homework for me! Hooray! I can be lazy!\"\rCome on! Push yourself! Overwhelm your selfishness! Do the homework! Stop being lazy!\rThis is a great example, to show, that Kirk Cameron wants to speak the majority who are in the two world-views:\r(a) Laodicean society (In the Bible, in the New Testament, read the book of Revelation, Chapter 3).\r(b) Corinthian society (In the Bible, in the New Testament, read the book of 1st and 2nd Corinthians).",
