To evade the ever-persistent Ronan, Quill is forced into an uneasy truce with a quartet of disparate misfits — Rocket, a gun-toting raccoon, Groot, a tree-like humanoid, the deadly and enigmatic Gamora and the revenge-driven Drax the Destroyer. But when Peter discovers the true power of the orb and the menace it poses to the cosmos, he must do his best to rally his ragtag rivals for a last, desperate stand — with the galaxy’s fate in the balance.… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Guardians Of The Galaxy is everything we go to the movies for, as Gunn is able to build an intricate intergalactic world full of multiple races, lush scenery, and maximum escapism through action, romance, comedy, and interstellar drama.",
    "Surrender, earthlings. It’s the Guardians’ world and you’ll be happy to live in it.",
    "It manages the trick of being both an unironic sci-fi action-adventure flick and a zippy parody of one. It’s exciting, funny, self-aware, beautiful to watch and even, for a flickering instant or two, almost touching.",
    "Guardians Of The Galaxy is the most charming Marvel movie so far. The primary ensemble (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, and Vin Diesel) is perhaps the most winning group of characters they've introduced in any of these movies.",
    "Director James Gunn’s first foray into big-budget movie making succeeds despite focusing on characters largely unknown to mainstream audiences and provides some of the most genuinely affecting moments of any Marvel film to date.",
    "A perfectly irreverent counterpoint to movies that take their superheroes a bit too seriously.",
    "The film's a giddily subversive space opera that runs on self-aware smart-assery.",
    "[A] blend of classic sci-fi fare and current pop-culture irony is what rockets “Guardians” into the stratosphere.",
    "Blessed with a loose, anarchic B-picture soul that encourages you to enjoy yourself even when you're not quite sure what's going on, the scruffy \"Guardians\" is irreverent in a way that can bring the first \"Star Wars\" to mind.",
    "It's easy to get carried away with movies like this, which lend themselves to fanboy hype. It's not a perfect movie. But it is one that is hugely enjoyable, bears repeated viewings and will be as funny in 10 years (or 50) as it is now. And that's pretty swell.",
    "Marvel’s rambunctious entry into the space opera genre—and the cornerstone of its “Cosmic Marvel” roster of characters and storylines—so perfectly embodies what the preceding months of hype and hope foretold that even its weak points (and it has its share) feel almost like unavoidable imperfections—broken eggs for a pretty satisfying omelet.",
    "\"Guardians” stands apart because it’s somehow truer to a comic book’s essence than any Marvel or DC-derived picture you can name. Which is to say it’s pulpy, kind of cheesy and giddily exaggerated (and aware of it) in a way that, say, the “Thors,” the “Captain Americas” and Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies are not.",
    "Guardians of the Galaxy does the impossible. Through dazzle and dumb luck, it turns the clichés of comic-book films on their idiot heads and hits you like an exhilarating blast of fun-fun-fun. It's insanely, shamelessly silly – just one reason to love it.",
    "Gunn makes this huge entertainment accessible to the converted and the neophyte alike, and he has only has one goal: To send you out of the theater with a fat smile on your face. Mission accomplished.",
    "It’s filled with a kind of giddy energy that leaps off the screen. It’s corny, it’s dopey, it’s sincere, it’s romantic, it’s thrilling and it leaves one anticipating the next adventure of these heroic goofballs.",
    "Gunn’s careful to keep the focus on the central five, but certainly proves himself capable of the bigger canvas. The film really pops visually, with an admirably bright color palette (DP Ben Davis doing excellent work), and though there are occasionally some geography issues, the action is mostly satisfying.",
    "The film, directed and co-written by James Gunn, is joyfully irreverent. Gunn lends his underachiever superheroes a geeky, comic camaraderie, and he brings a spry touch to the wacky intergalactic adventure.",
    "It is fast, it is fun.",
    "To see an expensive, big-studio movie freed from creative constraints and directorial cynicism is always a rare and wondrous experience. In a season of bloated indulgence, it’s also fair to call it a marvel.",
    "Here, a pulse, wit, beauty and a real sensibility have been slipped into the fray, alongside the clockwork guffaws, kabooms and splats.",
    "Gunn, a B-movie enthusiast who got his start at Troma, has found a way to bring funkiness and humanity to a galaxy-spanning blockbuster, one filled with dogfights and floating fortresses, but also with heroes quick with a quip, fast on the draw, and more than a little beaten up by the universe.",
    "As much as Guardians largely thrives through its lovably scuzzy style, it cannot avoid the immense tractor-beam pull of The Big Marvel Studios Final Act.",
    "Overall this is giddy, ridiculous fun, a witty, wacky and wonderfully generous sugary gift of a film.",
    "Mad, marvellous and all kinds of sci-fi magical, Guardians Of The Galaxy is Marvel’s riskiest but most surprising success yet.",
    "Guardians of the Galaxy is undoubtedly a flashy space opera, but if you are on board with that, it's a resounding success that takes a seat at Marvel's top table and suggests there could still be life after The Avengers.",
    "The fun of it – and Guardians of the Galaxy specialises in fun, served by the sugar-sprinkled ice-cream-scoopload – is in seeing this odd quintet bluster through space battles and alien brawls that would have defeated anyone smarter and better-equipped. Just as the team makes do with the junk they find around them, the film feels like a mound of gems culled from decades of pop-culture scavenging.",
    "Overall, the writers have crafted a well-articulated universe with distinct settings and relatable, compelling characters devoted to a thrilling quest for redemption.",
    "Guardians of the Galaxy is an outlier: a space opera in a largely earthbound movie cycle (excepting the occasional red-eye to another dimension in the Thor pictures), candy-colored and bopping where the other Marvel movies are muted and imposing, and the funniest one to date, without a doubt.",
    "What works best in Guardians is, in fact, the camaraderie of the team itself and the heart applied to their slowly gelling sense of family.",
    "The gadgetry and fight scenes are nicely rendered. The aeronautical battles, though, fall well short of state-of-the-art. Maybe they're collateral damage to the film's goofy style.",
    "Too loud, too long and too busy but – here’s the good part – also wonderfully silly.",
    "The film’s fast, amusing, good-looking and not overlong, which is all sensible non-geeks ask of such movies.",
    "With its introduction of wonderfully memorable characters and blend of humor, action and catchy tunes, Guardians is perfectly pitched escapist fun.",
    "A fun and relatively fresh space Western. Think “Firefly” pitched at 15-year-olds, with a lot of overt \"Star Wars\" nods. And super-“irreverent” dialogue that is, more often than not, genuinely funny.",
    "The motley crew’s repartee makes for comedy that’s surprisingly consistent, yet freewheeling and sharp enough to pinball from Kevin Bacon to Jackson Pollock and back.",
    "The film owes its relative buoyancy above all to Chris Pratt as the wisecracking space rogue at the helm.",
    "Guardians of the Galaxy is fun but forgettable, or perhaps Gunn crams so much onto the screen that memory is crowded out. Definitely worth a second look, just to figure out what in the name of Buckaroo Banzai is going on.",
    "The vibe, if not the specifics, is highly reminiscent of \"The Last Starfighter,\" \"Battlestar Galactica,\" \"Battle Beyond the Stars,\" and others. The fact that the movie's \"present\" is defined as being 1988 and the soundtrack is peppered with '70s tunes cements the retro feeling.",
    "Guardians boasts not one, but two Han Solo proxies — not to mention an ass-kicking Princess Leia surrogate, a villain with a very Sithian fashion sense, and the flora answer to Chewbacca. Also, one of the Han Solo types is a talking raccoon.",
    "Laugh-out-loud funny and production-designed to death, Guardians of the Galaxy pops off the screen.",
    "Though the special effects win the day, Guardians of the Galaxy holds court with a sense of humor that transcends its more familiar ingredients.",
    "The film’s scruffy, smartass band of brothers, along with Gunn’s light directorial touch, make for an invigorating breather after too many summer weekends of hammer-wielding superheroic solemnity.",
    "The film seems content to be the class clown of the Marvel Universe, which is all well and good. But like most class clowns, sometimes you wish it would apply itself — because it seems capable of being so much more.",
    "A likable lightweight, though it's heavy enough on cosmic combat and dazzling effects.",
    "It’s a high-spirited, swashbuckling lark driven by cartoonish special effects and an ingenious double-layered nostalgia that allows it to become a virtual mixtape of ‘70s hits that predate its intended audience: “Hooked on a Feeling,” “The Piña Colada Song,” “Fooled Around and Fell in Love,” etc.",
    "Unlike the stiff-jawed heroics of the other Marvel films, this feels a little looser and lighter, with Pratt as charming, amoral accidental leader Peter Quill, an earthling among the stars who, as he will tell you, is also known as the roving brigand “Starlord.”",
    "Director James Gunn’s presumptive franchise-starter is overlong, overstuffed and sometimes too eager to please, but the cheeky comic tone keeps things buoyant — as does Chris Pratt’s winning performance as the most blissfully spaced-out space crusader this side of Buckaroo Banzai.",
    "For every scene that soars into the dizzying heights of the pop sublime, there's another that crashes back down into the mundane troughs of studio-mandated formula.",
    "The movie practically satirises itself as it goes along, glossing over its own absurdity in the process.",
    "It’s a bit of a botch.",
    "Guardians of the Galaxy is pretty much where action movies are these days - a combination of comedy without wit, action without drama and elaborate visuals that are nothing much to look at.",
    "Gunn has to juggle so many plot elements — so many booming galactic battles, so many whisker-close brushes with death — that it's little wonder he loses his grip on the thing. He inserts occasional moments of wonder but doesn't bother to smooth over the seams.",
    "Guardians of the Galaxy brings to mind some of the most unforgettable sci-fi event movies of the last 30 years. Alas, those films are “Howard the Duck” and “Green Lantern.”"

Definitely the funniest marvel movie I've seen so far, though very different than what they've been doing. It's an ensemble sci-fi adventure comedy with clever dialogue and a memorable cast of characters. Similar group dynamic to what we saw in the avengers, made all the more impressive by the fact that they haven't had several movies to introduce the characters.\rIt has very little to do with the avengers specifically and instead widens the lens to encompass the greater marvel universe, making use of characters and alien races we've seen bits and pieces of before (most notably in the Thor films). The tone is very unique, bouncing effortlessly back and forth between comedy and genuine drama with an array of action scenes in a wide variety of set pieces.\rIf you've been following the marvel movies so far, you'll want to see this since it helps to expand the cinematic universe while setting the stage for the future avengers films (though in some ways it feels like it's setting up Avengers 3 more than 2). On the other hand, if you haven't been following the franchise very consistently or not at all, it still works as an adventure movie. The main characters have little or nothing to do with any of the movies so far, and while there are one or two faces we've seen before, especially in the villain department, you won't need to know them to be able to enjoy it. There's an important macguffin that ties into the larger story, but it's basically just there to drive the plot along. If anyone has been living in a cave somewhere for the past ten years or so, I'd be interested to hear what someone who hasn't watched any of the marvel movies thought of this.",

OH WELLL I GUESS THIS IS MY CUE TO START LAUGHING SINCE EVERYBODY ELSE IS LAUGHING. it got to the point where people were laughing and snickering at every tidbit in the movie, cause they thought that part was supposed to be a cue for the audience to laugh. nobody knew what was and what wasn't supposed to be funny!\r I guess I could call the humor in this movie DRY HUMOR cause the jokes are executed with a lack of exaggeration, and dry humor doesn't make me laugh out loud. dry humor just tells my mind that im supposed to be laughing at something.\r and that's what this movie fails at ultimately. this movie is a **** joke! never once was I worried about these evil guys destroying and taking over the galaxy! I was never worried! I was never at the edge of my seat! the movie didn't fill me with intensity and epic feelings! I couldn't because everybody was too busy laughing at each other and making a joke out of everything! soooo I wasn't laughing, I wasn't at the edge of seat in intensity, this movie just fails all around!\r the only good part of this movie was the somewhat epic ending with the bad guy, but even that got ruined with an attempted funny joke. the ending battle did get me laughing, cause it was so ridiculous you had to laugh. sooo this movie did make me genuinely laugh ONE TIME! but in doing so it ruined a totally epic battle that this movie had going at the time! soooo they sacrificed an epic final battle for a laugh. good choice director.\r overall, special effects were amazing, the only good thing about this movie. some touching moments here and there, a somewhat epic final battle, and you got yourselves a satisfactory, mediocre, marvel movie. lol goddamn marvel movies have been going downhill lately. seriously I would only watch this if you got nothing else to do on the weekend, but im pretty sure you can find things to do a lot better than this average film lol",

I make it aIt was memories of a joyless screening of Captain America that made me approach this new Marvel adventure with caution. A caution borne of years of instinctive experience of crass movies aimed at the lowest possible denominator. I make it a rule never to walk out of any film, but in between admiring the face of my watch and battling yawns with as much zeal as our eclectic on screen heroes were battling each other, I very nearly succumbed to breaking with this self enforcement. The film starts badly and never recovers. One of the most mis- judged elements is the vein of humour running throughout that is puerile, lacking the benefit of any real wit or genuine laughs.\rThe story may be simple but there is so much superfluous chatter to draw out the running time that it becomes a language unto itself, which is probably only decipherable by teenage boys or others interested in all things 'Star Wars'. Trying to emulate that 70's classic, and I use the term loosely, the film has its own double act comprising of a very vocal racoon and a selfless tree who are clearly modelled on the characters of R2D2 and C3PO.\rThe cast enthusiastically inject more energy into the material than it deserves, but one remains baffled as to what actors of the calibre of Glenn Close and John C Reilly are doing participating in this nonsense.\r Technically the film is outstanding. Cinematography and Special Visual effects are on the money and the Production Design is striking even if one set looks suspiciously like it had previously been used in 'Elysium'. Furthermore the Make-Up should easily walk away with an Oscar next year. However, excellent production values do not a good film make and as a movie the force is just not with it.",

Worth a matinee pricetag but not the blockbuster hollywood so desperately wants us to believe it is and clearly needs this summer (the worst hollywood summer season in years.)\r The heroes of the movie consist of a talking raccoon, a green woman assassin, a muscle bound mercenary, a talking tree and a funny human front man. The movie seemed to be confused on whether they wanted to make a a superhero film for the kids, a serious film targeting adults, or a rom-com teenager film. It felt like the movie never settled in to a theme and about a dozen times I found myself thinking \"that was out of place.\"\r For example, the main hero, played by Chris Pratt, starts off the journey on an abandoned planet where he turns on his 80's walkman, dancing and using the native lizard creatures for microphones to find an orb to make some coin from a collector. Its very fun, light and seems like a great movie that even the kids can come to. It then bounces towards the middle of the movie where the drunken raccoon \"rocket\" breaks down over his history, saying he didn't want to be created and at one point even tells his co-hero that he doesn't care that he lost his wife and daughter, in a move that probably sounded better written than they pulled off on film. Then add in and awkwardly long flip off scene from the main hero to the camera, an awkward blacklight \"sperm joke, and finishing the movie with a \"We're the guardians of the galaxy, **** punchline.\r I did find myself however enjoying the special effects and was surprisingly impressed by the acting from a tree, raccoon and former WWE wrestler.\r Worth seeing once, but it could definitely have done without all the hype.",

Nothing against marvels other superhero movies, this just had that little extra that made it awesome. With a wide array of characters being portray by a great cast of actors, this is a 2 hour long movie of solid entertainment. You follow a group of misfits turned unlikely heroes with the goal of saving the galaxy from a **** crazy antagonist with plans of destroying said universe. Most importantly, you get to see Chris Pratt's name on the big screen which is pretty cool for those who saw him come up as the goofy actor on parks and recreation. I went into this expecting more of a kiddish movie based on the pg-13 rating but I was pleasantly surprised to see marvel held very little back, what with swearing, some brutal killings and at least one dick joke, good ol' rating system. All in all this is an awesome movie that pretty much everyone has seen by now, but if you haven't, get your ass to the nearest theater and see it on the big screen for best results, going not sober also wouldn't hurt the experience as a whole.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nA fresh installment into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, \"Guardians of The Galaxy\" is a fun adventure featuring an interesting leading ensemble of characters. The film's visual effects really help to bring the various extra-terrestrial settings to life. The pop compilation soundtrack is an additional fun factor to the film's light-hearted humour.\r However, these features seem to make up for and mask \"Guardians\"' lacking plot in which a forgettable villain seeks to destroy the universe while the protagonists take measures to stop them, something not too dissimilar to other Marvel movie story lines (\"Thor: The Dark World\" in particular). This cliché plot needs to be given a rest, especially when the film doesn't seem to really accentuate that particular threat and its implications.\r Other than colourful alien worlds, there is nothing else that this film seems to offer or present other than its entertaining cast and humour. I really would have liked for a better insight into Peter Quill and his experiences, having been taken away so suddenly from Earth, and a better look at the various worlds we are presented with in the film. Star Wars is a great example of showcasing distinct planets that we become accustomed too and can easily recognise; \"Guardians\" needs to take a page or two from that book.\r I have a feeling that the direction in which this film could have been taken in was shunted due to the fact that Marvel wanted to introduce key plot points that would feature and play heavily in the overall arc of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and its Phases, especially with the expanded introduction of Thanos, whom we can speculate will be the ultimate villain in an \"Avengers\" movie. Though I understand that this film had the appropriate setting and theme in which to officially introduce these plot points, it feels like it drags it down from feeling like its own, separate entity and not just something that has to very specifically tie into Marvel's current plans for their movies.\r \"Guardians of The Galaxy\" is a particularly entertaining film with the crux of its popularity seemingly accumulated from the wild response to the vivid and discrete ensemble of characters and the film's lively and amusing tone. The cliché plot and forgettable villain disappointingly drags \"Guardians\" down. Don't be fooled by the critics' consensus; this film is good but its notable errors prove that there is definitely room for improvement. Origin stories often tend to fall into this trap but leeway is obviously permitted as the filmmakers get to find their footing and subsequently and hopefully deliver a more developed story and villain for the sequel.\r Is \"Guardians\" worth the watch? Yes! But, don't expect anything more than just a fun comic-book movie.",

I guess now I believe in the saying that the masses generally have bad taste.   The simplest of storeline with moronic dialogues (I mean even for a comedy; they are not even trying), a list of most cliché of \"jokes\" and a complete lack of chemistry between characters.  That's what this movie is about.  If you were looking for even the faintest clue that this movie was produced for intelligent beings, you won't find it.  I wonder if the people who enjoyed this movie let the eye candies, the light show and the explosions capture them and put them into a trance where their brain is completely shut off.  Does the masse love \"cheesiness\" and cliché that much?   Do they no longer wish to find even the tiniest bits of wit or originality in humour?  Do they even still know how to appreciate such a thing?   One of many examples illustrating the lazy juvenile writing of this movie :  Girl waits for guy at entrance of a pawn shop (or whatever) and gets him into a conversation.  Guy juggles this precious object that pretty everyone wants to get their hands on. Girl snatches it from him and runs away on foot in broad daylight.  I mean seriously.  Don't they even try?  And people accept this below mediocre work?\r I'm glad I only digitally rented this movie.  My girlfriend and I had enough of it half way through.

I should also note that this movie has a great soundtrack comprised of many 70s hit songs.\rThe thing that's very uneven in GOTG are the characters. The protagonist team is mostly good - Chris Pratt fits the role of space Indiana Jones well (although sometimes being too childish), Dave Bautista (Drax) is surprisingly funny, the Racoon is alright (although constantly angry) and Groot with its big eyes is just cute. However, the character problem starts with Gamora, who is Zoe Saldana painted green. Not only her character is cliche, but also her looks are just ridiculous and terrible. Sadly, the same applies to many other characters in this film. The crowd, consisting of many \"aliens\" is really just a lot of painted people, which looks pretty damn stupid. What is more, the main antagonist suffers from the same issue. I'm sorry, but an ugly blue **** in a rubber suit with some black **** splattered around his face just doesn't seem too menacing to me.\rAnyway, is it a good movie? Yep.

Don't you hate it when the whole world is caught up in a cultural moment, where everything just seems right with a movie, and you just don't feel it? Maybe I'm jaded, maybe I'm out of the times, or maybe I just think entertainment needs to \"earn it\"a bit more. Everything here is certainly in earnest and yes I had some laughs, especially with Rocket Raccoon and Groot (who are so good, they should have their own trilogy), but the film felt empty, poorly scripted (especially for Pratt's Starlord, leaving him with little to do but be cute, which he oozes effortlessly) and just creatively bankrupt. In particular, the device of the walkman could have been brilliant, but the filmmakers lack originality in their music choices and simply coast on songs that have already had their massive cultural moment (in particular \"Hooked on a Feeling\" which all but belongs to Quentin Tarantino, not to mention momentous choices from \"Boyz in the Hood\" and a PSH scene from \"Almost Famous\"). It would be one thing if Gunn was either 80 years old, or 22, but Gunn came of age with these other films (I'm assuming he's seen these touchstones) so his borrowing feels much more like laziness than homage.\r I am also shocked that the filmmakers were unable to make Zoe Saldana, one of Hollywood's most stunningly beautiful actresses look good. Honestly, their makeup made her almost unattractive. And this is someone who blew people away in BLUE makeup and cat eyes in \"Avatar\", and is incredibly sexy in the 2 recent Star Trek films (where she at least had a chance to appear in her natural pigment). Fortunately she brings gravitas to an almost thankless role (except the enormous residuals), thankless because the writers seem to forget about her until she is convenient.\rMostly this is a caper that spends a great deal of time with bickering, and highlighting ways in which Pratt's character is an unredeemable jackass to just about everyone he's ever met including his dying mother, some unfortunate little alien flying creatures, his father figure Yondu (Micahael Rooker).\r And once again, this is a movie where the film's funniest sequence is all but ruined by the trailer. I was bored watching the characters' introductions as previously seen in the trailer because, yep, seen it already, and it was funnier in the trailer because it had tighter editing.\r As I said, there are so many problems I didn't know where to begin. I'll stop here. Go see GOTG. Enjoy it's moment. I'm sorry it somehow escaped me.",

It seems Marvel is scrapping the barrel for more superhero’s to take the stage, butSo Guardians of the Galaxy is the latest flick from Marvel and not based on a group of superhero’s many people were probably familiar with before its release. It seems Marvel is scrapping the barrel for more superhero’s to take the stage, but anyways. Let’s get into it.\rSo first of all, the best thing about this film is probably its soundtrack. Thanks to the most relatable character, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), we get a handful of music that’s pre-90’s. The first example of this is in the opening credits sequence, which is fantastic. It’s fun and something never really seen in a Marvel film before. Seeing as how this film is like a cousin to Marvel’s The Avengers it focuses on a group of hero’s and not just one. However, unlike Avengers, which had a film previously released to explore each individual character, this film has to use some of its runtime to introduce each of the five characters right off the bat. Luckily this doesn’t happen too quickly, and it’s set up so the characters don’t like each other at first, which is a good way to keep us interested in how they develop a relationship with one another. Although I will say that the opening scene is depressing as hell, and it goes from realism to comic book feel too quickly. But overall, this film starts out kicking ass. It’s different, the characters are unique and interesting, and they get a really nice setup. Unfortunately as the movie goes on it starts to deflate slightly.\rThe biggest problem this movie has, despite its excellent take on character development, is its villains. The problem, simply put, is that they’re boring as **** Seriously. They have no character development. As far as I remember, the main characters don’t even talk to Ronin (Lee Pace) until an hour into the movie, and even then they barley have any conflict with him. The only person who has a real beef with this guy was Drax (Dave Batista) and even then it was too cliché and forced. In fact, Drax is probably the least developed and intriguing character of the five Guardians. Even Groot (Vin Diesel) is a more interesting character, mostly because he’s the sidekick to Rocket (Bradley Cooper), who is absolutely badass. Rocket and Groot practically resemble Han Solo and Chewbacca. In fact, they are Han Solo and Chewbacca. The clues are there. Look for them. In fact, both Peter Quill and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) have a rouge/Han Solo feel to them. At first they’re just trying to get what will make themselves happy, but then they grow beyond that. The relationship among the main characters develops really well as the movie goes on. It’s the villains that need more work. Don’t even get me started on Thanos (Josh Brolin). Is it even worth mentioning the actors name? The whole Macguffin (the thing that keeps the story going) was poorly explained as well. In this case, it’s the orb. It’s vaguely explained to be this all-powerful device which can unleash inconceivable powers, even though it’s apparent that only certain people can control it, one of those being Ronin. The conflict is that he wants to use it to destroy the republic of Xandar, which is implied to be like the capital of the galaxy, but there is no explanation of why. You know, what his beef is with Xandar, what their history is, and why he’s so keen on destroying them. Yeah, anyone who has read the comics doesn’t really need an explanation, and will probably fangasm over this film more, but what matters is the film as a film on its own. It’s not just made for fans who were previously familiar with Guardians of the Galaxy.\rOverall, this is definitely one of Marvel’s finest films in years. If you liked Avengers, then this is definitely your forte. The main characters are each unique and interesting in their own way and are really what make this film. And they should be. After all, they’re the Guardians of the Galaxy.",

There was nothing about this movie that really drew me in, and it's because the character stories were rushed so fast that you didn't get a chance to feel anything for them. We get to see each character for a few minutes before their paths collide. So when the characters only know each other for a few days, we're expected to believe they've bonded to the point where they'll die for each other? This movie should have been an animated film for kids in my opinion. The dumbed down dialogue sure fit. I really wish they focused the story on Peter Quill, instead he felt like a side character. That's probably because we have five heroes, four villains, and tons of side characters: Yondu and his crew, the Collector and his slave, Nova Prime and the entire Nova Corps. So many pointless characters could have been cut from this film, and the necessary time could have been given to develop Quill's story. This would have improved the movie dramatically. Don't get me wrong... all the characters in this movie do look really interesting, however, you can't squeeze all their stories in a 2 hour film, otherwise it's a mess. The directing was great, the overall story was good, the action and special effects were superb, but the characters are so shallow... the core flaw with this movie is the numerous characters that shouldn't be in a film that's introducing the casual viewer to a completely new universe. Keep it simple. This is not the Avengers, where each super hero already had their own individual films that established their character's background.",

No. This movie actually isn't much good. Way too many effects overload the story until at times the screen is a virtual moving abstract painting hardly making any visual sense at all. The tongue in cheek cuteness is way too self conscious. Zoe looked great in blue in Avatar, but covered in green in many of the shots she looks unattractive, which is something I never thought I would say about her. She's always been the sexiest actress around in my book. The story is your average save the world from a weapon of mass destruction plot, where the bad guy has absolutely no motive for being destructive. Maybe once it becomes available for a few bucks it might be worth a casual viewing from the corner of your eye when you're doing something else, but as I write this it's only downloadable for $20, and it is definitely not worth that.\r I have to add something about the reviews posted here. In more than one review, a poster criticized the \"dialogs\" in the movie. There is no such word as \"dialogs.\" The plural of dialog, is dialog. Just like the word \"fish.\" And the better spelling is \"dialogue.\" And I will agree, there was a lot of bad dialogue in the movie. But there were no \"dialogs.\"",

I just can't come up with many flaws for this movie.\rThe chemistry is top notch between the characters even more so than Avengers.

Marvel took a risk on the source material considering that the characters aren't as well known as the likes of Iron Man, Hulk & Captain America. But the overall execution is flawless. These characters are all perfectly cast, instantly loveable & absolutely hilarious. Chris Pratt's Peter Quill a.k.a Star Lord is one coolest anti-heroes ever and you root for his larger than life character because he has such human and relatable qualities that bring him down to our level. His character pleasingly had a vibe than reminded me of classic heroes like Han Solo & Indiana Jones. Zoe Saldana's Gamorra is a worthy heroine, Bradley Cooper's voice work for Rocket Racoon is hilarious and Vin Diesel's Groot steals the show. Most surprisingly Dave Bautista is brilliant as Drax the Destroyer, he brings a real physical screen presence and he adds witty and dry humour. Michael Rooker, Peter Serafinowicz & John C. Reilly are all fun and worthy mentions also. Sadly the only characters who feel underdeveloped, generic and forgettable are the villains. But otherwise this is one of the funnest films I've ever seen. One of the most successful elements of the film has to be the soundtrack. The Awesome Mix Vol. 1 tape is pure genius and it feels like a character in it's own right. It's definitely one of the best, most varied and most inventive soundtracks of all time. Featuring tracks from the likes of 10cc, David Bowie, Jackson 5 & of course Blue Swede. The set pieces are all thoroughly enjoyable and visually this is a very entertaining film. But what sets this film aside from the wrest of Marvel cinematic universe is the genius use of humour, banter and bickering between the characters. And unlike the the wrest of the Marvel films to date, this feels more like a comedy that features great action and set pieces, rather than an action film with segments of humour thrown in. The Guardians of the Galaxy made me laugh and smile from start to finish and sentimentally I'll forever love this film.",

As it turns out, this was a fresh new banana that was a little green on the outside but still quite tasty on the inside.\r I have very little experience with this Marvel series of comics. I can’t say whether the film is true to the comics or not. And, I don’t care. This is a well made film that will appeal to a wide audience. It is fast, fun, and fantastic.\r The formula for this film as my son Nolan also pointed out, runs parallel to the epic Avengers movie of a few years ago. That film however had all of its characters established in an impressive run of eight movies. This film had no such introduction. Yet it did have one thing on the Avengers; the opening scene introducing the main character and setting the tone for the entire film. This opening sequence may very well be the best of any of the Marvel films. Now let’s not forget that the opening scene for the Avengers features Natasha Romanov taking a call from Coulsen during an “interrogation” and in its own right is one of the best ever. But it did not tell us anything about the movie we were about to watch. It showed us that Scarlett Johanssen can pull off bad ass and look great doing it. It gave us insight into her character and it was brilliant. But Guardians’ simple and fun opening told a lifetime of tales about our “hero” to be in the short span of a few minutes.\r We start in 1988 when Peter is just a boy in a somewhat dramatic scene (no spoilers here) and quickly cut to 26 years later and a now grown Peter in a scene that is part ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’ and part ‘Risky Business’. The music and the action drives home the core value of our protagonist as well as any opening sequence in any of Marvel's other feature films.\r The opening is followed by 120 minutes of fun. This movie moves at a fast pace, maybe a touch too fast at times, but never to an overly frenzied spectacle. In a very short period of time we are introduced to a full cast of “heroes” and director, James Gunn manages to give us characters we can feel. This is no easy task and many a good movie has failed to properly develop characters in this kind of group setup.\r Marvel has always done a great job of injecting humor into the sometimes dark themes that permeate the super hero versus super villain dichotomy of this genre. Guardians manages to be a genuinely funny movie from start to finish. This story never really takes itself too seriously and that is what makes it so darn good. Fantastic Four (2005) offered similar 'smart-alec' humor like this film.\r Our main character is absolutely lovable and pretty tough in pinch. At the end we are given a hint that he is more than he appears to be, and you will of course want to stay all the way to end of the credits to find a most peculiar revelation that may foreshadow the return to the silver screen of a quirky character you never would have guessed.\r This is one of Marvel's best efforts. Yes, it is that good. You need to go see it, right now!",

I don't watch mindless dross on the SyFy channel because I take no delight in watching awful films. I sat down to watch this with high expectations because people had told me it was brilliant. It's not brilliant. It's how I imagine those SyFy movies are. Loud, obnoxious, mindless... and boring. The \"humour\" on offer goes something like this... \"I'm a tree. I'm a tree. I'm a tree.\" This is the only thing one character can say, and it is the punchline of several \"jokes\" throughout the movie. Joy.\r There was no story to speak of. Character development was basically a guy saying \"I'm a tree\" a lot, oh I give up.

It's the first Marvel movie set in the cosmos, opening the doors to the weirder Marvel Comics stuff. Five unrelated characters are initially united for money but at some point they decide to protect the Galaxy and become heroes instead because a Kree named Ronan the Accuser has gone mad and wants to destroy a planet named Xandar with a powerful artifact. Sure, the movie's plot is messy at best, and there are some pompous heroic lines that become cringy because they are both cliche' and are spoken badly. But it's a stylised movie full of great situational jokes, with great character interactions, likeable protagonists, featuring a great soundtrack composed of '70s hits, and you forget about the above negatives.

Thanos, Marvels most imposing and important villain was still kept on the slow burner and appeared only slightly more than he did in the Avengers post credit scene but even without him showing his true colors he was still pretty damn menacing. Also, Chris Pratt proved to the world that he is ready for a leading role in his quirky, sarcastic and comedic role. All of the supporting characters DELIVERED as well from Bautista's Drax proving his merit as an actor to Zoe Saldana proving she is fit to play the deadliest woman in the galaxy.

There are some REAL actors in this movie (Rooker, Riley, Close, Deltoro), unfortunately they share 5 minutes of screen time. A couple of original situations and jokes that rise above the usual mediocrity I've grown accustomed (and fed up with) to when it comes to superhero movies. The dialogs are a lot better than your usual retarded and overused lines nowadays blockbusters vomit in our ears. Also it's a space opera and not a superhero movie. That's about it.\r The very bad : was sold as a new and fresh approach to comic book films, ends up being the usual pile of redundant clichés and thrash that has been thrown to our faces since the last 10 years. tries to have a hardcore edge but being a disney film (including a line that uses the word \"whore\". Yup, a disney film), that vibe gets quickly kicked in the nuts. So why even try being hardcore in the first place?\r Apart from a couple of scenes, there is absolutely nothing new with this movie. You have your mandatory space dogfight, confusing brawl, escape from prison scene, all the usual bull****, shot as unoriginally as possible. Formulaic, boring, predictable from beginning to end. The plot is three sentences long. The main cast sucks, Pratt is useless and transparent and that hack Cooper tries to play it mob gangster (I heard he was going for Joe Pesci in Goodfellas. PESCI IN GOODFELLAS, can you believe the nerve on this ****ing guy??), but fails miserably because he has no acting talent whatsoever and becomes incredibly annoying in about 15 minutes.\r Saldana is useless and all the characters are so clichéd, generic and poorly written or fleshed out that you quickly don't give a **** about what happens to them. And shoutout to Vin Diesel and his - wait for it- SINGLE LINE OF DIALOG. Talk about acting skills.\rThe space dogfight scenes look like ATTACK OF THE ****ING CLONES. Didn't everyone hate that movie? Could you be honest with yourselves just a minute and acknowledge that GotG isn't really better? Not to mention the last half hour is a ripoff of Return of the Jedi. Call it a \"tribute\", I call this a ripoff.\rThe humor works on a 10/2 ratio : 10 jokes, two giggles (not LAUGHS). I could go on and on and on but I'm getting fed up writing about this turkey.\r Final words : geekboys, NO MOVIE DESERVES 0 or 10. Go and learn how to ****ing grade. A movie deserves 10 if it can resurrect the dead. Since this never happened, stick to 8 as being the absolute top grade, and adjust your ratings accordingly. When you rate a movie 10 or 0, you're just screaming I'M A TEENAGE  ****ING IDIOT THAT HAS NO CLUE TO WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. Furthermore by doing this you are ****ing up the rating system, and trhanks to that a metacritic ratings now means **** ALL.\rThat being said GotG rises 5 inches above the usual boring and retarded nonsense contemporary blockbuster's average quality thanks to a couple of funny dialogs and a second degree approach that merely saves the day.\rOtherwise it's just your same old, same old bull**** script that has been done a thousand times before and will be done a thousand times again. Until you ****ing retarded idiots pull your heads out of your asses and start asking for actual quality productions instead of being spoon fed the usual atrocious insults to intelligence that hollywood execs enjoy shoving down your throats in exchange for your precious dollars.\r Most of all leave the ratings to people who know something about good movies and have an IQ superior to 65. Nighty night retarded kiddies, time to go to bed.",
