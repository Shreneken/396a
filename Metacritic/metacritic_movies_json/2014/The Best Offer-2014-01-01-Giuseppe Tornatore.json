    "critic_reviews": [
        "Screenwriter/director Tornatore is best known for his nostalgic \"Cinema Paradiso,\" which won the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in 1990. But The Best Offer is completely different in style and tone; it\u2019s dark instead of light, a psychological thriller of sorts, only with Virgil\u2019s heart and orderly life in peril instead of his life.",
        "The film has several smart twists and surprises up its well-tailored sleeve.",
        "Part of the pleasure in watching The Best Offer is the elegant, unassumingly suspenseful way it unfolds. You never quite know where it\u2019s all headed, in part because it never quite tells you what kind of movie it is. I called it a \u201cromantic thriller,\u201d but there\u2019s a lot more movie here than that.",
        "Between its erotic underpinnings and increasingly preposterous third-act reveals, the film could easily pass for middle-grade Hitchcock. Since its premise is that forgeries can still have value, that\u2019s a high compliment.",
        "Rush has a lot of fun with Oldman\u2019s gradual thaw, and the questions the movie raises about authenticity and deception, while not remotely in the same heady league as those in \"Certified Copy,\" nonetheless allow it to conclude on a satisfyingly ambiguous note.",
        "Tornatore\u2019s ideas about art, trust and intimacy are curious, even if they do not quite click.",
        "An intriguingly Hitchcockian premise gradually takes on a preposterous air in the art-world noir The Best Offer.",
        "Vertigo this ain\u2019t, but there\u2019s some quasi-Gothic charm in the baroque premise and eccentric marginal details, including a mathematically gifted dwarf.",
        "Though it begs for a little lightening up, a moment of irony, a wink at the audience, this dead-serious fairy tale about a mysterious young woman (and a phantom automaton straight out of Hugo) is worth watching for Geoffrey Rush\u2019s sensitive, never pandering performance.",
        "Rush gives everything he has and manages to make Oldman (such an obvious name) into more than an automaton. Not so Sylvia Hoeks, who struggles to make Claire any more alluring than oil dripped on canvas.",
        "Mr. Rush can\u2019t fly far on Mr. Tornatore\u2019s dialogue and workmanlike plotting, and Sylvia Hoeks, as Claire, doesn\u2019t bring a corresponding energy.",
        "The fully committed Rush, at least, commands our constant attention, and no movie with a kookier-than-usual Ennio Morricone score (dig those staccato-chanting chorines!) could ever be a total waste of canvas.",
        "Filmed in what you might call the international hotel style, Tornatore's idiotic premise is entertaining if you don't inspect it too carefully, or look for anything beneath the portentousness.",
        "Aiming for a Hitchcockian take on an eccentric auctioneer (well-handled by Geoffrey Rush) who becomes enamored of an heiress with severe agoraphobia, the pic ends up more in Dan Brown territory, with over-obvious setups and phony insight into the art establishment.",
        "It's all a bit overheated, and while there is certainly nothing wrong with melodrama, the problem arises when the script (also by Tornatore) keeps insisting on explaining its own symbolism and subtext, to make sure we get how deep the thing is.",
        "It ascribes to the falsehood that a rarefied milieu inherently infuses a film with intelligence, as if inept execution can be covered up by pretty lensing.",
        "Strangely old-fashioned in its construction and requiring a Golden Gate-level feat of engineering to achieve the suspension of disbelief necessary to unironically enjoy it."

There were about three or four parallel plot threads that keep the story rolling along  Still, the story was interesting enough.  It had some nice sets and scenery (Italy, Prague and Vienna), and it's a vicarious thrill to see how the rich really live.  Ditto for the profession of a auctioneer.  The film is nicely carried by Geoffrey Rush, who with Donald Sutherland in the film  you don't get better first rate actors than these.  The other younger players do a fine job.  I found the musical score a bit heavy handed as well.",

An English language film, Geoffrey Rush in the lead. It was about an aging art and antique auctioneer, Virgil. The story reveals his final days in his professional field where he meets a young woman who pursued him for her inherited antiques to put on auction. The woman is very mysterious, because of her medical condition and how they both become so close despite their initial meetings were disastrous is the remaining film to tell us with a twist in the final.\r It was an awesome storytelling. The screenplay was the top notch and the matching background score. Especially when the story ends and credits rolls up, all those memories from the film keeps us fresh with that music. The music won several awards for the film. I liked the story, but towards the end, I kind of predicted almost everything. That did not stop me, so I enjoyed it thoroughly. Particularly the theme of the film, which I think a bit fresh, and I liked the conclusion as well, but I feel it should have been different or more to it. The way it ended might disappoint some people, but still it is very smart.\r Everybody was good, but it was Geoffrey Rush, who stole the show with his stellar performance. Three years might be a little late, but it's never too late to watch a fine film like this. One of the best suspense films from the recent time, it is a must see, particularly if you are seeking a good entertainment. So I hope you watch it if you're not yet.\r 8/10",

And I am glad that I dedicated my time to it, as I discovered a truly remarkable film. The story centers on the figure of VirgilI am not a connoisseur of Italian cinema, but I was attracted to this film because it deals with works of art. And I am glad that I dedicated my time to it, as I discovered a truly remarkable film. The story centers on the figure of Virgil Oldman, auctioneer and collector, misanthropic and maniac who, suddenly, is contacted by a mysterious heiress, eager to evaluate and eventually auction off all the valuable stuff in his family home. It turns out that she suffers from a severe agoraphobia, so she never leaves the house nor lets herself be seen by anyone, a fact that leaves Oldman more and more fascinated. At the same time, the old auctioneer finds a series of mechanical pieces in the house, which he thinks belong to a disappeared baroque automaton that, if recovered, would have an absurdly high value.Everything seems clear and transparent in this film, brilliantly directed by Giuseppe Tornatore... but the film dextrously hides its secrets and is not as predictable as it seems, although it is left to guess, as the end approaches. For the puritans, it may shock thanks to the lustful and obsessive passion allowed by the old man for a woman of age to be his daughter, or even granddaughter. But the fact is that Italian filmmakers address this type of passion quite a lot in their films and the story works wonderfully. In the background, there is a sub-plot involving a baroque automaton and the lack of scruples of an art collector, who is interested in buying valuable works at prices well below the value.Geoffrey Rush is a veteran actor and excels in the role of the auctioneer. He knows how to be cool and aloof, arrogant and elegantly hieratic, and manages to gradually deconstruct it as the character's feelings change. It is worth watching this film to see the extraordinary work of this actor. Beside him, the young Sylvia Hoeks, whom I did not know and is excellent, in a complex role that requires a lot of voice work (she does not appear for a considerable time, and we only heard her voice) and a beautiful face. In the dim light, the equally hardened Donald Sutherland is impeccable in a supporting role. Jim Sturgess also does a remarkable job.Technically, it is an equally very good film. Although it is discreet, and allows the history and work of the actors to have space to stand out, the interest in production values is high, starting with a magnificent cinematography, guided by Flavio Zamarion. With an artist's eye, he knew how to make the most of the beauty of the paintings and works of art, as well as the grandeur of the scenery, the filming locations, the landscapes, and create a film where visual beauty abounds and fills the eye. Light and color also work very well, giving the film an additional elegance. The choice of filming locations and works of art that were used in the film was, in a word, judicious, and the soundtrack, signed by master Ennio Morricone, is truly one of the best he has composed in recent times.",
