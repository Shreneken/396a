  "summary": "Exposed profiles eight women and men who use their nakedness to transport us beyond the last sexual and social taboos that our society holds dear. These cutting edge performers combine politics, satire, and physical comedy to question the very concept of normal. Flying high with them, we get to look down on our myriad inhibitions. This filmExposed profiles eight women and men who use their nakedness to transport us beyond the last sexual and social taboos that our society holds dear. These cutting edge performers combine politics, satire, and physical comedy to question the very concept of normal. Flying high with them, we get to look down on our myriad inhibitions. This film creates a unique perspective, taking the audience into the clubs and other hidden spaces where new burlesque is challenging traditional notions of body, gender, and sexuality. The body types of the performers range from statuesque to trans-gender to disabled, and their personalities from sensational to scintillating.… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The film lacks background and cultural context, a surprising choice considering the rich history of the art form. But the interviewees are so compelling that their stories stand on their own.",
    "A documentary that manages to be jaw-droppingly provocative and genuinely endearing — sometimes at alternating points, and by the end kind of all at once.",
    "These confrontational comedians — however serious the message, it’s always imparted with liberal dollops of humor — are experts at merging shock and showmanship.",
    "Allowing its subjects to bare their souls as much as their bodies, Exposed is as frequently moving as it is entertaining.",
    "Exposed is really just a series of intermingling profiles, which is perhaps why its observations eventually begin to feel slightly repetitive.",
    "Like burlesque itself, Exposed is at its best when it shows rather than tells.",
    "If you’ve never been to a burlesque show, now you know what you’re missing. The dedication and warmth of the performers are infectious.",
    "The filmmaking style is practically nonexistent: interviews and static shots of the performers onstage. They are thoughtful and often funny, especially Mat Fraser, a British man whose arms were damaged by Thalidomide, and Julia Atlas Muz, the off-stage partner with whom he often performs.",
    "Beyond the forthright identity politics and titillating theatrical misdemeanors, one still comes away wondering about the things that remain concealed."
