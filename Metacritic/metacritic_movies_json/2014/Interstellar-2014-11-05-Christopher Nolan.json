  "critic_reviews": [
    "Interstellar is simultaneously a big-budget science fiction endeavor and a very simple tale of love and sacrifice. It is by turns edgy, breathtaking, hopeful, and heartbreaking.",
    "What a beautiful and epic film is Interstellar, filled with great performances, tingling our senses with masterful special effects, daring to be openly sentimental, asking gigantic questions about the meaning of life and leaving us drained and grateful for the experience.",
    "Genius director Christopher Nolan reaches for the stars in Interstellar — and delivers a soulful, must-see masterpiece, one of the most exhilarating film experiences so far this century.",
    "Brainy, barmy and beautiful to behold, this is Stephen Hawking’s Star Trek: a mind-bending opera of space and time with a soul wrapped up in all the science.",
    "Interstellar is Nolan’s best and most brazenly ambitious film to date.",
    "It’s a bold, beautiful cosmic adventure story with a touch of the surreal and the dreamlike, and yet it always feels grounded in its own deadly serious reality.",
    "An exhilarating slalom through the wormholes of Christopher Nolan’s vast imagination that is at once a science-geek fever dream and a formidable consideration of what makes us human.",
    "Interstellar turns out to be the rarest beast in the Hollywood jungle. It's a mass audience picture that's intelligent as well as epic, with a sophisticated script that's as interested in emotional moments as immersive visuals. Which is saying a lot.",
    "Like the great space epics of the past, Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar distills terrestrial anxieties and aspirations into a potent pop parable, a mirror of the mood down here on Earth.",
    "What the neg-heads are missing about Interstellar is how enthralling it is, how gracefully it blends the cosmic and the intimate, how deftly it explores the infinite in the smallest human details.",
    "This is epic cinema that begs to be compared to \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" But unlike Stanley Kubrick's psychedelic joyride, this journey is powered by a human heart.",
    "Interstellar is still an impressive, at times astonishing movie that overwhelmed me to the point where my usual objections to Nolan's work melted away.",
    "Whatever its length and melodramatic third-act touches, Interstellar is a space opera truly deserving of that label, overreaching and thought-provoking, heart-tugging and pulse-pounding. It’s the sort of film that should send every other sci-fi filmmaker back to the drawing board, the way Stanley Kubrick did, a long time ago in a millennium far away.",
    "I was moved by Interstellar, and there are stretches where it is as good and as pure as anything Nolan's made. You can feel just how important all of it is to him in every frame of the thing. I don't love all of the film's dramatic choices, though.",
    "Brainy and exciting at the same time, Interstellar invalidates the need for mindless Hollywood product.  No matter its shortcomings, the movie achieves an impressive balancing act. It turns the mysteries of the universe into a cinematic playground, but for every profound or visually arresting moment, it also encourages you to to think.",
    "Interstellar may not be perfect, but tent-pole filmmaking with such ambition and grandeur is always worth celebrating.",
    "In Interstellar, Nolan has created a universe where ultimately the possibilities are endless. At its best, the film feels the same way.",
    "A movie I snickered at more than once but never stopped staring at in wonder. This isn’t Nolan’s best film by any stretch, but it abounds in the qualities that are among his strengths.",
    "With Interstellar, Nolan’s reach occasionally exceeds his grasp. That’s fine: These days, few other filmmakers dare reach so high to stretch our minds so wide.",
    "Nolan reaches for the stars in spectacular fashion, delivering a mesmerising sci-fi epic that, despite a testing running time and few too many flights of fancy, is grounded by an on-form McConaughey.",
    "This grandly conceived and executed epic tries to give equal weight to intimate human emotions and speculation about the cosmos, with mixed results, but is never less than engrossing, and sometimes more than that.",
    "This is Nolan’s unabashed tribute to \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" the first movie he ever saw at the age of 8 and the one that made him decide to be a filmmaker (there are homages to that earlier film everywhere).",
    "The movie is “Gravity” cubed, an epic of space travel and human destiny that swings by Saturn, slingshots through a wormhole, and pinballs across a handful of planets on its way to a rendezvous with infinity, conveniently located inside a black hole.",
    "Einsteinian, Kubrickian, Malickian, Steinbeckian - Interstellar, Christopher Nolan's epically ambitious space opera, is all that. And more. And, alas, less.",
    "A knockout one minute, a punch-drunk crazy film the next, Interstellar is a highly stimulating mess. Emotionally it's also a mess, and that's what makes it worth its 165 minutes — minutes made possible by co-writer and director Christopher Nolan's prior global success with his brooding, increasingly nasty \"Batman\" films, and with the commercially viable head-trip that was \"Inception.\"",
    "While it reaches for the stars, director Christopher Nolan's Interstellar is a flawed masterpiece...The story is ever-ambitious, sometimes riveting and thought-provoking, but also plodding and hokey and not as visionary as its cutting-edge special effects.",
    "So this is the greatest Shyamalan movie ever made by someone else, or maybe it’s Christopher Nolan’s best impression of what a Shyamalan movie ought to be like. No doubt that sounds like a backhanded compliment, but I don’t entirely mean it that way.",
    "Interstellar often seems afraid to let any development go unpacked and uncommented upon, except for a handful of points that dive into the action and expect viewers to catch up. The film is at its best in these moments, when it’s unafraid of challenging storytelling, particularly since Interstellar never has trouble finding visuals to match its heady concepts.",
    "Black holes, relativity, singularity, the fifth dimension! The talk is grand. There’s a problem, however. Delivered in rushed colloquial style, much of this fabulous arcana, central to the plot, is hard to understand, and some of it is hard to hear. The composer Hans Zimmer produces monstrous swells of organ music that occasionally smother the words like lava. The actors seem overmatched by the production.",
    "In his florid sci-fi opera Interstellar, Christopher Nolan aims for the stars, and the upshot is an infinite hoot — its dumbness o’erleaps dimensional space. It’s hugely entertaining, though.",
    "Interstellar is riddled with ridiculisms; the but how comes … never stop. And yet: Nolan, a notoriously chilly filmmaker who’s never shown much faculty with matters of the heart, is pinning that heart squarely on his sleeve.",
    "Nolan takes big chances with his actors, his action scenes, and his pacing -- you'll feel all 169 minutes in your backside -- and the payoffs come slowly and sometimes not at all. It's frustrating because there's so much to look at, so much money well spent in every frame, but Interstellar wears out its audience long before it ends.",
    "It is an episodic, chunky film of over-explicated ideas and speculative set pieces.",
    "Interstellar, his (Nolan) sci-fi spectaculorama helixed around a father-daughter love story, is a gamble like no other in his career. It's his longest film, his headiest, his most personal. And, in its square-peg-in-a-round-wormhole stab at being the weepy motion-picture event of the year, it's also his sappiest.",
    "While it’s technically eye-popping and intricately structured, Interstellar is at its most fascinating when it struggles hard to communicate those things we human beings call “emotions”. Instead, we get something like a freeze-dried approximation of Steven Spielberg at his most sentimental.",
    "The movie could have gone several ways, too — and it is heartbreaking to watch this ambitious story choose the wrong one and get lost in space.",
    "Whatever his strengths may be, Nolan lacks the human touch. His movies are numbingly sexless, and by that I don’t mean they need sex scenes or nudity -- those things are rarely really about sex anyway. But in all of Nolan’s films, human connection is such a noble idea that it’s beyond the grasp of flesh-and-blood people.",
    "It’s a glorious spectacle, but a slight drama, with few characters and too-rare flashes of humour. It wants to awe us into submission, to concede our insignificance in the face of such grand-scale art. It achieves that with ease. Yet on his way to making an epic, Nolan forgot to let us have fun.",
    "Thankfully in space, no one can hear you yawn.",
    "Nolan tries to pair the cosmic esoterica with this father-daughter tussle, but the mix doesn't jell. Visionary movies require a bigger vision.",
    "Interstellar tries so hard to be so many things that it winds up shrinking into itself, much like one of the collapsed stars Coop hurtles past on his way to new worlds. For a movie about transcending all manner of dimensions, “Interstellar” ultimately falls surprisingly flat.",
    "Despite its many virtues, Interstellar feels as if it doesn’t quite hit the target.",
    "Much like his hero, Christopher Nolan's goal seems to be to take the humor and wildness out of imagination, to see invention in rigidly practical and scientific terms.",
    "For much of the film, Nolan (who co-wrote with his brother Jonathan) seems to be unafraid to allow this big-budget extravaganza to tell a story that's about pain and loss and melancholy and sacrifice. Until it's not that anymore, and Interstellar becomes thuddingly prosaic.",
    "Nolan’s 168-minute odyssey through the space-time continuum is stuffed with stuff of bewildering wrongness. Eager for grandeur, I went in hoping for the very best from a filmmaker with his own vision of the theatrical medium’s potential. The last thing I expected was a space adventure burdened by turgid discussions of abstruse physics, a wavering tone, visual effects of variable quality and a time-traveling structure that turns on bloodless abstractions.",
    "Promising outer-space majesty and deep-thought topics like some modern variation on Stanley Kubrick's “2001: A Space Odyssey,” Interstellar instead plays like a confused mix of daringly unique space-travel footage like you’ve never seen and droningly familiar emotional and plot beats that you’ve seen all too many times before."

Interstellar isn't just a massive space-adventure. It's much more than that; it’s a film about human bonding.\r Interstellar is by far the best sci-fi film of the year, and one of the greatest of all time. The vast storyline about the connection between us humans is so incredible, I felt so attracted to the characters and I almost started crying because it's so dramatic and epic. I usually don't feel so attracted to the characters like in Interstellar, so this was just so incredible! When it comes to the actors and their roles, are they all superb. Matthew McConaughey as Cooper is just fantastic; he's both dramatic and stunning in action. Jessica Chastain and Mackenzie Foy as Murph are both awesome, even a bit touching. One aspect of Interstellar (when it comes to the actors) is that there's one actor I didn't expect to be in this film, so it was a big surprise! There's even some humor between the characters in this film, which I didn't expect. As mentioned, the story is wonderful, but there might be some slow scenes in the end of the first act, but the ending explained it all so there's nothing wrong about it!\r Interstellar is a film that just kept going and going when I saw it. I thought it would end like 3 or 4 times but instead it just continued with even more exiting and innovated things that I never have seen before. I can tell you this: if you thought Inception was something innovating and spectacular, go and watch Interstellar, you won't regret it! Some people think the last act of the film is less impressive, but I don't agree, it's fantastic! The structure of Interstellar is in my opinion very similar with The Prestige, maybe not as excessive but I totally love it! It's so clear that this is a film by Christopher Nolan, just the visuals are incredible and I was so amazed while watching it. It even looks more real than the film Gravity, and the first 30 minutes of Interstellar is totally superior than Gravity. I couldn't even see if there are CGI in this film, and that there's no 3D is a great thing!\r There are some minor flaws in the film, and the first thing is the soundtrack. Yes it's from the famous composer Hans Zimmer, and I love his previous works like the music in The Dark Knight Trilogy and in the film Inception. But it's not exactly as massive and touching as I thought it would be. It's still impressive, but not as vast or touching. Another thing is the first act of the film; it felt like they had cut too much scenes, because it felt a bit to fast. There could also have been a bit more action. The last aspect is the trailer, it doesn't spoil much about the film, but I think they should have shown less of the visuals. It could have resulted in even more surprising things with the film.\r This is the best film from Christopher Nolan to date, but it's not a perfect film. Even though, I don't think we need to wait that long until he creates something even more spectacular than Interstellar.\r Interstellar get a 9.5/10",

Words simply can't describe the experience I had while watching this movie unfold before my eyes in that glorious 70 MM Imax format. The visuals were jaw dropping, acting was superb, and the story was filled with originality and hand full of surprises along the way. There is so much to this movie you don't know about when you go into seeing it for the first time, which was a huge plus! The less you know about the story for this movie, the better. While there are a lot of positives for this movie, my only complaint would have to be the pacing of the story. There were a couple instances where I felt like the story was being rushed and that I had to just go along with what was going on at those points. Despite the movie being almost three hours long, I kinda wish it could be a little longer so that the story could progress more naturally. Other than that, I have no other negatives to mention. I walked out of the theater feeling satisfied and wanting to experience it again! And probably will!",

Cinematography is some of the best that I have seen this year.  I really feel that this is Nolan's love letter to the genre.  The movie is not without fault though, but everything blended so WELL that I still gave it a 10.  I have not had a movie invoke so much emotion as this one did in a long time!

There's a lot of unnecessary dialogue that just takes away from the emotional heart of the film - like that bloke who starts explaining why worm holes ought to be spherical in 3 dimensions using flowcharts and diagrams. What was the point of doing that? For one you'd think a Nasa pilot whose mission is to enter a wormhole would know that but more importantly it degraded a thrilling moment (entering the wormhole) with a bunch of prose. And there's a lot of this in the film. The part on Newton's 3rd law made me cringe.\r Characters explain the effects of warped space-time to each other and throw away cheesy relativity punch lines but they hardly ever have real human moments. I would've preferred if the film explained none of its scientific complexities. Let the audience rise up to the occasion, let them figure it out. But this is where Nolan's commercial instinct takes over. I get that he's trying to sell the film to a wider demographic and I get that there had to be some amount of exposition but Nolan does this to such an extent that it takes away the humanity of his characters. Why should I care about them? Exposition is a cheap alternative for not being able to convey your ideas through imagery. Anne Hathaway's Dr. Brandt is a poorly written character because midway through the film, her personality just flips in a dime and we have a new character clothed in the same flesh. She's introduced as a stern and no-nonsense woman but later on she starts spewing the most nonsensical things in the movie - like that \"love is quantifiable\" baloney she's obsessed with. Again just shows you Nolan's women can't be strong women, they can only be strong lovers. I was shocked in the end when I found out that Cooper and Brandt were supposed to end up together. Was there any chemistry there? And then you have Matt Damon who's not really a character but a walking wikipedia that's there only to list the pro's and cons of being human - the performance doesn't help either.\r The part of the film that needed explaining is the sci-fi-y part (which you can't look up in a book) about how humans are planning to leave the planet. In fact I still don't understand it. So the astronauts went searching for some specific numerical data required for solving some equation that could be found only inside the black hole but how would the unification of general relativity and quantum mechanics help us leave the planet. In fact how did we leave the planet? Weren't we out of fuel? I'm not trying to poke holes or anything. I just don't get it.\r There's things that the movie does very honestly and get's right - like the relationship between Murphy and Cooper but I also think there's stuff the film gets very wrong. The best scene Nolan's ever directed is from the Dark Knight when the Joker leans out of the police car and shakes his head in glee. There's no dialogue, there's no music but it's a haunting and beautiful sequence that conveys volumes. In my opinion Interstellar never achieves that sort of artistry. I still liked it but I don't think it's as good as recent sic-fi films such as Wall-E, A.I., Children of Men, Minority Report, Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind or Nolan's own the Prestige. Interstellar may leave one feeling completely indifferent or deeply moved. Sadly I'm among those who felt it was contrived, unfocussed and eventually self-defeating.",

Not that the story is superior to Kubrick's classic, but there's a heart to it that I did not expect.  I enjoyed the science - it does not talk down to its audience, and I can say I learned a few things.    I especially enjoyed the robots with their matter-of-fact voices/affect.  Though they don't have a human appearance - they initially appear super clunky (until you come to realize what they're capable of) - you instantly feel comfortable with them, which I credit in great part to the incredible voice acting of Bill Irwin.

Or it may have been at the one point a crew member is lost and the reaction was, “So what?”\r The film is long, at 169 minutes, with a lot of forgettable science verbiage that is forgotten by most of the audience before the credits start running. Will even the science nerds in the audience remember the dialogue regarding the black hole or the worm hole? Isn’t it enough to say that  one hour in space will equal 7 hours on earth without getting into quantum theories? I’d rather hear how Anne Hathaway’s hair stays so sculptured after having a space helmet on for a flight, walking in water and on ice plus the gravity experienced, which is talked about but doesn’t seem to affect hairdos!\r Director Christopher Nolan and co-writer of the script with his brother Jonathan, seem to know what they want to say when dealing with family relationships but when the abruptly take off space they seem to get lost. “Gravity” set the bar high for filming in space and spaceships and “Interstellar” comes nowhere near those scenes and feelings. The Nolans, along with the Director of Photography Hoyte van Hoytema, get the feel, sights and sounds of earth drying up and the possibility of the end of earth is made believable as are the various family relations, but once the movie blasts off to space everything comes to a halt except for a robot that seems more livelier than the humans.\r The cast do what they can with what they got but Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, former test pilot who is brought back to lead this mission to find a place that the humans on earth can move to before they die, is fine in the father and daughter scenes but does not bring much to the hero aspect of the film. Oh, and a side note, he does need to put on some of the  weight he lost for “Dallas Buyers Club”. Anne Hathaway has a thankless part while Michael Caine as her father gets to repeat Dylan Thomas”s poem “Do not go gentle into that good night” a few times. Murph, Cooper’s daughter, is played by 3 actresses and as the 10 year old Mackenzie Foy is a stand out while Jessica Chastain as Murph in her 30s has nothing to do but being angry.\r David Gyasi and Wes Bently as the crew working with McConaughey and Hathaway, along with computerized robot voiced by Bill Irwin, are more than adequate. They are 3 other actors, not to be named, in the film so as not to provide spoilers. Also Casey Affleck, as Murph’s brother, in an underwritten role does what he can with it.\r Ah yes I must give credit to Hans Zimmer for the too often loud music, signifying nothing, for keeping me awake in the last hour of “Interstellar”.",

Sadly what this all adds up to is a bigHere we go again reviewing yet another failed giant which clocks in at a butt numbing 169 minutes. It's an ambitious but flawed venture that is big in concept, big in budget and explores  big themes. Sadly what this all adds up to is a big disappointment. The story, full of as many holes as there are black ones in space, is a mish mash of ideas which never really gel and one never quite gets a hold of what the point of it all is. The actors don't offer much by way of compensation either. Anne Hathaway shouldering the worst of the dialogue is the biggest casualty here, but Michael Caine is also tiresome as is Matt Damon who adds nothing. Matthew McConnaughey is better, but whatever emotion or empathy the film generates, and there are some very moving moments, are purely due to the wonderful Jessica Chastain. The film's biggest asset is her performance, although it's good to see film legend Ellen Burstyn showing all the others how it's done in just one tiny scene.\r The banal dialogue is often gibberish and causes the rolling of one's eyes in disbelief or embarrassment. Nearly all scenes are over extended and often one is inclined to tune out long before they are finished. The special effects are good, but aside from a couple of sequences (a huge wave and the final set piece involving McConnaughey and Chastain),there really isn't much that we haven't seen before. The music comes on strong and sounds like an extended version of Mike Oldfield's 'Tubular Bells' from 1973's 'The Exorcist', co incidentally starring Burstyn in one of her finest roles.\r The sound is very loud and effective during the set pieces, but is then often inaudible during simple dialogue exchanges between characters. I have no idea what Anne Hathaway was mumbling at the end in so pained a manner.\rThere are some marvellous compositions of the outside of the spacecraft filmed in complete silence, which are then judiciously cut with the sound included inside the ship. More of this and less dialogue would have been appreciated all round. Another gimmick that serves little purpose was the almost inevitable inclusion of the robot TARS. I would have recommended the removal of his power pack.\r Director Christopher Nolan is certainly full of ideas but, unfortunately, they are never fully realised. He comes over like a young boy trying to communicate a passion or a hobby that no one else gets. His direction is over indulgent and left me confused and bored. Perhaps after two dramatic failures (Inception was very similar in style, but an even worse film!) he should try his hand at comedy. After all laughter in a cinema in infinitely preferable to sleeping.",

Flawed, because more time was spent rendering out the special effects than developing a screenplay worthy of the cast and budget. When you're a filmmaker who can make anything you want - on film - there is no excuse for your films to not bring something new to the table and work at a basic screenplay level.\r Interstellar does not ask new questions and with a script that literally feels like a first draft --I'm just shocked that Nolan didn't develop this more. The entire core of this film is the relationship between our lead Cooper and his daughter - but this is so rushed and honestly, extremely cheesy, that we don't care what happens. They spend far too much in time in space - with a ridiculous plot involving Matt Damon - and cut back to Earth is sporadic cuts that pull us into so many directions. There is no focus in this film.\r This film proves that the Nolan brothers can not handle a couple of things: writing females and writing emotional characters that we're attached to. The dialogue was laughable - over the top in many places - and basically just a ton of one-liners.\r We cut from Cooper learning he has to go to space - says goodbye - boom on the rocket - NO ATTACHMENT. There is zero development here - just get him to space, which fails to tell the core story well - which bites this movie in its ass in the third act. There are countless films that do this way better - Apollo 13, Close Encounters (they don't even go to space there) - if you want the audience to care about your characters then you have to spend more time making them care - not as much with the science and pizzaz - and I know everyone will love this movie, but it's not just minor flaws here - it's gaping holes in both motivation and development.\r Forced. Rushed. However you want to put it - I'm sorry folks - it's not a great movie - not even a good one. Everything is spoon fed to the audience - no, not just the science - the twists - I didn't know on the nose screen writing was so acceptable in Hollywood - guess it is. They talk about ghosts so many times within the first act that anyone with half a brain KNEW there was something there - and if you know anything about space travel, black holes - or any of the stuff that is talked about in the trailers - you can put two and two together and call the major twist in the FIRST ACT. I literally turned to my girlfriend and called it - as did the other 5 people we were with...\r And yes - I understood all the underlying themes and motifs he was playing with - love/gravity etc - but it wasn't enough to save a script where the characters aren't given room to breath.",

I never liked Brand's awful monolgue about love. I get that she's supposed to be wrong and irrational and over-emotional in this scene (isn't she supposed to be a scientist?), but she's proven right in the end, which just sucks for so many reasons. I mean, they seriously made the only female scientist on board be the one that almost jeopardizes the mission because she gets emotional and misses her boyfriend. Yikes.I never liked dialogue. I've always had a problem with how Nolan movies are written.

I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph, just like I found this moment.TARS: How, Cooper?COOPER: Love, TARS, love.-------------------------------------------------------------This movie wants to be 2001: A Space Odyssey, but it feels like Nolan didn't trust the audience to be smart enough to understand the film like Kubrick did, so instead of conveying its themes and science visually like 2001, he makes the characters constantly explain the science to the audience and give long speeches about whatever he's trying to say. It's like he thinks we're babies or something.I like most Nolan films, but this just feels like he didn't respect the viewer's intelligence enough, and it turns what could have been a poetic space epic into a bunch of boring characters telling us what's going on at all times.",

The master of twists and deception made Batman real, showed us how dreams work in Inception, and brought us inside the dangerous world of magic in the Presitige. In his latest film, Interstellar, Nolan tackles the concept of time and how different it is from what we perceive. This film does have a great twist in the end and some terrific special effects, but beyond that it is one of the longest and slowest moving films I've seen in years. Once again, Humans have finally destroyed Earth and have gone looking for a new home, but outside our solar system, things are much different than they appear. Time and gravity are different concepts in different regions of space, and the effects on the crew, who had hoped to one day see their families again, diminish with each passing day. Matthew McConaughey stars and as is the case with most of his films, he's terrific. Based on some of the poor choices he made in his younger years, he has a bad rep among critics, but the fact is that he's always fun to watch, and is one of the most intense actors out there today. As for the rest of the film, it's usually Nolan's genius that makes the film unique and special, but in this instance he was too smart for his own good. The story moves very slowly and at times is more than somewhat confusing, not to mention at nearly three hours long, it's a challenge to sit through to even reach his famous twist at the end. Nolan films are something I always look forward to, as they are different and both entertain me and make me think, but in this case, I was just beyond bored and fed up with the whole thing. I guess sometimes even genius takes a holiday.",

These little buzzers swarm around The Light That Is Nolan and in His light, nothing can ever go wrong. Who cares if Bane’s death in The Dark Knight Rises was ridiculous?\r Okay I get it, Memento was ingenious, The Dark Knight set new standards for the superhero-scope of the cinemaverse, but Nolan sure doesn’t have the Midas hand of movie-making. He’s a man, he makes mistakes, and not all of the stuff he makes turns out so fabulous.\r Sure, Interstellar has fancy technology, as its Oscar for Best Visual Effects will demonstrate. The most accurate portrayal of a wormhole, precision of orbital physics and astrophysics, [insert fancy jargon here]……\r All that’s great, except that there’s more to a movie than just technical splendor.\r Stanley Kubrick’s science fiction masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey isn’t considered one of the greatest sci-fi films ever created only for its revolutionary techniques in portraying space and spaceships; its profound ruminations of the nature of man and the questions it raises on the divide between natural and artificial intelligence are what has put the film on the pinnacle of cinema. Of course, the movie’s amazing sequences of spaceships moving slowly in harmony with Strauss’s majestic pieces cannot be overlooked, but that does not mean they are the sole reason behind A Space Odyssey’s critical acclaim.\r Interstellar tries valiantly to mimic both the technical and philosophical marvels of historical sci-fi films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, yet it fails by a long shot in delivering a significant, poignant message. The early scenes between Murph and Cooper fall flat in emotion; neither the acting nor the dialog carry through the fragile emotions that should have been exchanged in such a scene. Nolan’s efforts to raise questions on the “human identity” are easily spotted in scenes that seem almost forced, with little contextual connection to the sequence of events that move the story forward. The best example would be Anne Hathaway’s excruciatingly cringe-worthy scene in which she claims love is worth jeopardizing their whole mission and the future of humanity for. Seriously, this comes out of nowhere—when did Hathaway’s character become so irrational and obsessed with her probably long-dead lover?\r “Love is the one thing we’re capable of perceiving that transcends time and space,” she cries. Sound like something from one of those turn-your-life-around-through-these-10-steps books? It’s unbelievably sloppy and unrealistic dialogue, and something I’m not at all surprised to find in a Nolan movie. Self-important, philosophic textbook quotes may work in a superhero movie where the hero is expected to be somewhat presumptuous, but not so much for a supposedly realistic science fiction flick.\r What I’ve concluded is that Interstellar is neither unique nor special; its ideas of travel through wormholes and warped time in different areas of the galaxy have already been entertained in science fiction films of an earlier age such as Star Trek. The only factor that Interstellar can show off above all other is the accuracy to which it incorporated modern theories of space and time—the wormhole’s curved surface is supposedly the most accurate representation of such a thing ever put on screen.\r Perhaps the supposed scientific genius of the movie becomes more real to its audience because of the background of the movie, or the way the subject of space travel is treated. Science fiction movies like Star Trek seem far off from reality—such movies portray themselves as fiction, a made up world, a world that is usually beyond the parameters of a “what if” world that diverges from our own. Interstellar, however, tries to make itself seem like an extension of the reality we live in—our future very well may have in store for us a dry, bleak land that has forsaken the human race. Dying potato fields and giant dust storm seem less childlike, less like a figment of our imagination than do lightsabers and evil warlords waging war on the galaxy. We are led to empathize with the world of Interstellar as if it were our own and not a created fantasyland, which is why some of the things that happen in the movie seem less absurd than what happens in other films of the same genre (of course, these “things” exclude the infamous bookshelf and Morse code scene, the absolute bane of the movie and the epitome of Christopher Nolan’s over-ambition with his newest project).\r So if you thought Interstellar was an absolute blast, good for you. Congratulations for spending those extra dollars on watching IMAX 3D or whatever it is they have these days. Next time though, you might want to consider crashing on your couch with a nice, homemade bowl of buttery popcorn and let Netflix lead you through the world of true, time-proven science fiction. (Of course, Interstellar re-runs are always available. Respect personal preference I must.)",

These things just don't mix and the obligatory inclusion of a family story that's not really done with any conviction, spoils the entire drama and dynamic of the film.  It's just like when they have the kid in Terminator 2 having fun with the Terminator.  No, no, no!  Jumped the shark right there with a cutesy family angle.  Stupid!  And the same kind of thing spoils this film.Also, the adventure isn't very interesting either, and I can't even remember much about it now, that's how dull it was.  One problem is that Hollywood needs to realize that BLACK HOLES ARE OVER -- they aren't interesting or cool anymore.  That was the 70s, guys.  Let's move on to other topics, please.",

This dystopia mission against time takes ambitious paths to tell a human story about the power of love. Interstellar is simultaneously a big-budget science fiction endeavor and a very simple tale of love and sacrifice.It’s a bold, beautiful cosmic adventure story with a touch of the surreal and the dreamlike, and yet it always feels grounded in its own deadly serious reality.

It also contains a bunch of scientifically looking inserts which makes it to appear more hm... solid, truthfully looking, you know... The truth is \"I don't buy it\" was the phrase I constantly repeated while watching this movie. While each scientific ground is true in separate, together they form a frankenstein. Fuel consumption in the time-slowing gravitation field of Gargantua (it is horrible, guys, horrible, unless you use gravitational engine with galactium as a fuel:); the ability to perform a kryo flight and the inability to maintain hydroponics... or to extract oxygen from the environment (for those, who forgot or never knew, oxygen accounts to 49% of it by mass) In general: clumsy solutions to the invented problems. I don't buy it.I would not mention scientific and common logic as an argument at all, but without it the movie is just boring. If you do a melodrama, don't fill the movie with the science. If you do a scientific apocalypse, make sure it looks plausible in the whole, not just in parts.The only plus of this movie: it is well made in visual forms and actions. Only because of that respect to the amount of work done it is 6/10",

In fact, the CD for this movie should be put up in museums and shown in history textbooks, for being known as the greatest movie ever that Metacritic gave a 74. I don't know what apes watched this movie and didn't like about it, I'm assuming it is the apes that are shown at the beginning of 2001 A Space Oddessy. ooh ooh ah ah silly ahh monkey people be able to discover Obelisk but can't discover a good reason to like this masterpiece made by Christopher Nolan (goat). If I were Christopher Nolan, I wouldn't even stress if I got a bad rating from Metacritic, knowing they gave Intersteller and Dune (2021) an 74. Actual **** apes who run this silly ahh website full of fat ass nerd who can't even see past their bellies when they wake up in the morning, the amount of fungus and popcorn under those **** chin and stomach roles would help starving children eat, and even then they still would give interstellar something other than 74. I'm honestly not shocked that you people didn't like the movie, I just know you were lost in confusion before they even left the atmosphere. But I bet you guys got really excited when they brought up cornfields until you have more corn stored under your rolls than they have on the entire planet. I now want to review the movie using a 3 act structure. Act 1 (Exposition-Inciting Incident) Act 2 (Midpoint-Rising Action) Act 3 (Climax-Denouement). We are introduced to our Main Character 'Cooper' played by Academy Award Winning Actor Matthew McConaughey, a farmer born in the wrong generation, grew up through many life-altering and developing world issues, being a previous Nasa Astronaut, settles down with his family where he becomes a father of two, his daughter 'Murph' played by Mackenzie Foy. And his son 'Tom' played by popular actor Timothée Chalamet. Without being shown on screen it is shown it is hinted that the mother of the two died. That introduces the Co-Parent to Cooper 'Donald' played by Golden Globe winner John Lithgow. It is also told that he is the father to the mother of Cooper's children. Eventually, Cooper ends up on a mission to a different galaxy to hopefully find a life-sustaining planet. Act 1: Act 1 (just like every act in this film) is an undisputed masterpiece, it starts out the film trickling with minor little problems, Murph getting into trouble at school, sand storms, and slowly losing all food resources year by year. But our first lead up to the 'Inciting Incident' is when a sandstorm occurs and they are forced to retreat home, when reaching home Murph is quick to realize she had left her window open, Cooper and Murph quickly head up to her room to not only discover sand all over her room but sections of gravity that seem to be spelling something out in binary. It's revealed to be coordinated to a hidden NASA base which Cooper and Murph Decide to head to, but are quickly taken in for questioning. When brought in it is discovered that an old friend of Coopers 'Dr. Brand' played by Academy Award-winning actor Michael Caine. This is when Dr. Brand introduces us to our 'inciting incident' Dr. Brand reveals he has been trying to find a way to bring the entire planet to space without killing everyone, and bettering human life, but he does not have the means to do the equation, so plan b is to enter a wormhole and enter a new galaxy, to find a planet that is suitable for human life. This is when Act 2 begins. Cooper is told that a team of people was sent to the galaxy to study and find the best planet, but all had lost contact with Earth. Cooper is given a new mission to go to this galaxy, find the best planet, and start the new human race. He accepts the mission and leaves his family. Murph is heartbroken and angry at her father for this. But that does not stop Cooper from doing the greater good. I got bored don't feel like finishing whole review Metacritic sucks, Christopher Nolan is the goat, bye-bye",

The next work of Christopher  Nolan arrives with much more strength than Inception, not only because we  jump from dreams to space, but also because is noticeable the consolidation  that reached this director. First is the setting of the story, the life of  mankind in the Earth has come to an end, although the interesting thing is  how Nolan shows it, from the point of view of a family. Here it is clear  the importance that acquires the human side in the story (which is also  present in Nolan's filmography), and this theme from the beginning to the  end is the protagonist. Some examples are the decision that Cooper has to  make, whether going to space but miss seeing his children grow or stay; and  the other one is probably the most heartbreaking scene of the movie, when  the protagonist sees the compilation video (astonishing performance btw).  This whole thing aims to evaluate human behavior, sometimes subconsciously  (Inception, Memento) and others rationally (Interstellar), but both about  survival instincts. Another amazing things about the picture are: the  visual effects, obviously, how the crew gather the current info and  theories about the aspect of a real dark hole; second, how it exhibits the  concept of relativity; and finally, the representation of time as a  tangible dimension. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat for nearly  3 hours, definitely nothing like what has been seen before.",

But I slightly disappointed that it wasWell, one off from two of this year's most expected movies alongside 'The Battle of Five Armies'. Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers. A good sign from Jonathan Nolan, who can make big in the entertainment industry in a future like his brother.\r As we know many had liked 'Inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. But the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. In fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. Totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. An educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. Only the slow movie pace would test their patience.\r It was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. This movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a boring piece, Cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. I don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well.\r The first three quarters of the movie was well made. It puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by Brian Cox in a television series. Like I said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that I never expected one from Nolan film. It was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. I liked science and emotion coming together. In fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from NASA production through Nolan direction.\r There are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. We can call it a series of twists like the layers. Compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. And that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. Which give an impression of the movie 'Inception'. In a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'The Tree of Life' and the remains are 'Inception'.\r The story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. But the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. As a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. We know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble.\r Anyway, this movie defines in a new way, I mean scientifically the existence of ghost. It was not a horror movie, but I liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. That explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. Hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. In my opinion, this will replace '2001: A Space Odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way.\r The visuals were not that great, but simply very good. To see those in digital 3D would have given us a different experience, sadly Nolan was not in favor of that technology. Hoping this movie would get as many as the Oscars nod. Especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. Like I said I'm no one fan, I just love watching everyone's every movie. I would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3D, since I'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films.\r The end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. I would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. I know his fans want that to happen and so am I. What I gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise Nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa.",

The emotional development of the characters was just perfect, and while certain plot developments were dropped into conversations earlier in the film, I can understand why this was done. It was to aid people who seem unable to comprehend complicated plot structure, in this respect Nolan failed, as a lot of people still seemed to be in the dark.\r This film is sci-\"fi\", so the third act, however fantastical, was not meant to be grounded in reality. Even so, the tesseract created by our descendants, and their ability to manipulate gravity and consequently time, alludes to unfathomable technology from our current technological viewpoint. The black hole could have been an artificial construct used as a teaching tool to transfer knowledge from a 5th to a 3rd dimensional being. Time being represented as a \"physical\" environment in this 5th dimensional space, such as the 2 dimensional wormhole was represented as a sphere in 3 dimensional space.\r From the visuals (which were just awe-inspiring) to the decision to allow atmospheric sound and music to mask the dialogue in places, representing either the immensity of the situation or the sheer emotional trauma at such points.\r I love that in this day and age, a Hollywood director could create such a piece which transcends the mundanity of daily (current) societal games and norms, and directs our gaze to the ineffable majesty of a greater reality which exists all around us.\r I can't wait to watch this again.",

There are small weaknesses  which keep it from being a perfect 10/10 on my list, but it is still one of the best sci-fi movies.\r The plot seems  to be very well written for the most part, especially the science. You can tell they did their research. The use of scientific concepts like gravity and time distortion (or w/e you call it) was very unique and cool, and I really like that we got a glimpse inside a black hole - of course we don't know what is really inside, but its cool to explore one possibility.\r There were some small things I didn't like - for example, I still don't know how I feel about the concept of \"love\" as some space/time transcending force - it sounded a bit cheesy.

It's hard to miss this fact, what with all of Matthew McConaughey's monologues on the topic in the film's first half hour or so. The blighted, dying future Earth is practically a metaphor for its navel-gazing population, so blind to the fact that they're literally farming themselves to death that they actually rewrote the history books to discourage wasteful wanderlust. So it comes as little surprise that explorers are the ones plotted to save the species in spite of itself.\r However, getting past the heavy-handed setup is worth it, because once the crew of Interstellar's interstellar vessel takes off, so does the movie. The visuals are always great and sometimes amazing. The care with which the film's universe is rendered is apparent. Kip Thorne, Interstellar's science adviser, really earned his paycheck here. The actual science is less perfect, but if you can ignore all the hand-waving at the beginning and ending of the film, the rest might actually teach you a thing or two.\r It goes without saying with a cast like this that the performances are all solid, including an unexpectedly disturbed turn by Matt Damon.
