  "summary": "An actor (Michael Keaton)—famous for portraying an iconic superhero—struggles to mount a Broadway play. In the days leading up to opening night, he battles his ego and attempts to recover his family, his career, and himself.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Led by a fantastic Michael Keaton, Birdman is a deeply thoughtful and darkly hilarious meta dissection of egotism that satirizes the entertainment business with a compelling visual style that is all its own.",
    "Birdman is a delicious and delirious pleasure.",
    "A magnificent and enthralling film that fits into no easy genre bracket, Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue Of Ignorance) – to give it its full title – is a technical tour de force, a beautifully performed and smartly scripted black comedy that will leave its audience keen to head back for more.",
    "Watching Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu’s multilayered “Birdman” is like unfolding a piece of intricate origami; it keeps opening in unexpected directions.",
    "Iñárritu ditches time-hopping bleakness for a linear, if loopy, satire that buzzes with brio. If Mel Brooks, John Cassavetes and Terry Zwigoff co-directed a superhero movie, this might be it.",
    "Birdman is everything you want movies to be: vital, challenging, intellectually alive, visually stunning, emotionally affecting. And welcome back to the big time, Mr. Keaton; you have been sorely missed.",
    "Everything about Birdman is a bold cinematic stretch, from its snare-jazz soundtrack to a climax regrettably stretched too far. The line between Iñárritu's genius and Riggan's madness gets crossed once too many, but no matter. Birdman has 99 virtues and ignorance isn't one.",
    "From the first line of its deep, rapid-fire dialog all the way through to its trippy ending -- which is guaranteed prompt discussion on the drive home -- Inarritu has crafted a film that begs to be rewatched, with the promise of each repeated viewing bringing something new.",
    "The thrilling cinematic joyride that, among other improbable feats, puts Michael Keaton, as Thomson, smack in the middle of the Oscar race for best actor.",
    "Birdman finds Iñárritu in the mood for play, and with a mighty cast that fields every pitch he throws.",
    "Lots of films claim to be different. Birdman is.",
    "This is a remarkable feat, not only of cinematography, but of choreography. Just to film Michael Keaton and Edward Norton walking down a Manhattan street, everything had to be timed as in a dance — when the camera swirls ahead, when it goes behind, when it swoops back around. It’s all accomplished so smoothly that it would be worth doing merely as a stunt, except this is no stunt. This method carries the mood and soul of one of the best movies of 2014.",
    "The bravura gestures work gorgeously in Birdman, as does the humor, which playfully balances the film’s most mystical, contemplative ideas with a steady stream of inside jokes and well-calibrated shifts in tone and dynamics.",
    "Birdman is a treat. But it's also more than that. It's a full-fledged wonder.",
    "This is a strange and beautiful and unique film, one of the best movies of the year.",
    "The film is so soaring, sometimes literally, I hardly missed the feeling of hard ground underfoot.",
    "Birdman is a complete blast from start to finish.",
    "With its improvisatory score (drummer Antonio Sanchez provides a hustling backbeat throughout), its seamless shots, its leaps into the surreal, and then back again into the excruciating, embarrassing real, Birdman ascends to the greatest of heights.",
    "The director's surrealist portrait of modern times and the cult of celebrity is brilliant on so many levels that even the occasional downdraft can't keep Birdman from soaring.",
    "This pitch-dark comedy, which was directed, con brio, by Alejandro G. Iñárritu, sizzles as the camera circles, stalks and swoops. Emmanuel Lubezki’s friction-free cinematography constitutes a virtuoso turn in its own right in a production that’s strewn with superb performances, some of them loud and bold, others subtle and restrained.",
    "The camerawork in Birdman is an astonishment, and an argument that everything flows together, which in this movie means the cinematography, the story, the people, even time and space.",
    "I'm jazzed by every tasty, daring, devastating, howlingly funny, how'd-they-do-that minute in Birdman. Like all movies that soar above the toxic clouds of Hollywood formula and defy death at the box office, Alejandro G. Iñárritu's cinematic whirlwind will bring out the haters. They can all go piss off. Birdman is a volcano of creative ideas in full eruption. Buy a ticket and brace yourself.",
    "Serious and silly, self-aware and ironic, it’s the movie that questions stardom, fame and celebrity, built around a role Michael Keaton had to become a has-been to play.",
    "A triumph on every creative level, from casting to execution.",
    "It's dazzling and rambling, intimate and sprawling, and it's carried along by an infectious, off-the-cuff jazz score. As soon as it ends, you'll be dying to fly with it again.",
    "The film's exhilarating originality, black comedy and tone that is at once empathetic and acidic will surely strike a strong chord with audiences looking for something fresh that will take them somewhere they haven't been before.",
    "It’s borderline miraculous.",
    "Birdman is a rich, startlingly clever and multi-layered collage, with Iñárritu creating a meta-universe of mirrors and performances upon performances.",
    "Spectacular, star-powered cinema that makes us ask anew what cinema is for. Call it a \"Dark Knight\" of the soul.",
    "Birdman is a scalpel-sharp dissection of Hollywood, Broadway, and fame in the 21st century. But more than that, it's a testament to Keaton's enduring charisma and power as an actor. He soars.",
    "Moment to moment, Birdman manages to shift gears, its roaming camera revealing new surprises as it glides along. That degree of unpredictability provides it with the ultimate response to the sea of formulaic mediocrities at the center of its critique.",
    "Birdman dares to be ambiguous, but unlike most essays in ambiguity, it is also a hell of a lot of fun.",
    "Shot in 30 days after a long rehearsal period, with the actors’ and the camera’s movements calibrated to the inch and the millisecond so the action flows smoothly, the picture has the jagged energy of a long guerrilla raid choreographed by Bob Fosse.",
    "Doing a whole movie this way isn't unprecedented, of course. Hitchcock's \"Rope\" did it without digital trickery more than half a century ago. Still, it's a great cinematic stunt, even when you think you've found the hidden edits. And it makes Birdman as exhilarating a flight of fantasy as you're likely to see anytime soon.",
    "Birdman, right now, is on the money. In Riggan and the rest of the cast, writhing with the dread of being a nobody but appalled by what it takes to be a somebody, we see not just the acting bug but also the New York bug, the love bug, and, if we’re honest, the life bug, diagnosed as what they are: a seventy-year itch.",
    "The director has wisely assembled an ensemble of performers who know how to handle a long take; this will certainly rank among Keaton's career highlights — in a role that allows him to completely dump out his paintbox and show a vast range of emotion — but everyone shines.",
    "Above all else, Birdman is tender, raucously funny and deeply tragic.",
    "Birdman takes advantage of every facet of Keaton’s talent, from his knack for absurdist comedy to his seemingly effortless ability to tap into graceful profundity without making a big show of it.",
    "One of the year's most audacious, savagely funny and unpredictable films, it features an outstanding performance by Michael Keaton as the has-been star of a superhero franchise desperate to be taken seriously.",
    "It’s perhaps the most incisive and funniest Hollywood take on Broadway since Mel Brook’s original “The Producers.”",
    "Birdman—I should probably note here that the full title is the punctuationally ridiculous Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)—is a giddy fantasia of themes and genres, and if not all of them fully cohere, then so be it. As the Birdman voice inside Riggan’s head reminds us, sometimes viewers crave pure entertainment, not just “talky, pretentious, philosophical bullshit.”",
    "Keaton reminds us what a fine actor he could always be.",
    "For Michael Keaton, Birdman is some kind of gift from the movie gods, a license to have his cake and messily devour it too.",
    "This is no tale told by an idiot — on the contrary, it’s a funny, fast-moving parable about fame and ambition, laid out for us with care and craft by a gifted filmmaker, a long-missed actor, and a world-class cinematographer. But I’m left with the suspicion the whole thing may signify — well, if not nothing, at least a good deal less than the filmmakers would have us believe.",
    "It’s undeniably thrilling to watch Gonzalez Iñárritu and Keaton aiming so high. Whenever they’re brave enough to leap into the unknown, Birdman soars.",
    "Yes, at its best, Birdman soars, swoops and flutters with life and invention, but it parrots more than it speaks. You long for a writer as reliably, elegantly witty as Tom Stoppard, whose dramas are typically “backstage,” or if not Stoppard, at least a verbal speed-puncher like Armando Iannucci, or if not Iannucci, someone as relentlessly inventive and obsessive as Charlie Kaufman to make you feel like somebody is trying to say something, rather than a writing team filling in the intelligent-sounding words to support the boisterous performances and the virtuosic camera dance.",
    "Birdman proves that a movie — the grabbiest, most kinetic film ever made about putting on a play — can soar on the wings of its own technical prowess, even as the banality of its ideas threatens to drag it back down to earth.",
    "The movie is punctuated by comedy that at times verges on slapstick but there's an underlying anger in evidence - anger at the popular mindset that allows movies like \"Transformers\" to flourish while artistic endeavors fail.",
    "Birdman is a marvelously entertaining picture, a work of \"look at me!\" bravado that's energized every minute. Its proficiency, the mechanically fluid kind, works against it in some ways.",
    "This is not a film in need of creativity, passion or energy; what it needed was restraint, consideration and direction. This is not saying that Birdman is awful, or a debacle; there are superb scenes here, as well as excellent performance moments, but they get drowned out in the flood of Iñárritu’s ambition, energy and fantasies.",
    "Birdman is the very definition of a tour de force, and Iñárritu’s overheated technique meshes perfectly with the (enjoyable) overacting—the performers know this is a theatrical exercise and obviously relish the chance to Do It Big. But what comes out of the characters’ mouths is not so fresh.",
    "There’s no doubt it makes for a jubilant ride, a galvanic first blast. But it remains a film which feels deeply thought rather than deeply felt; a brilliant technical exercise as opposed to a flesh-and-blood story.",
    "A movie with ambitions as high-flying as its superhero but a success rate decidedly lower to the ground.",
    "It places regurgitated ideas into the mouths of gifted actors, then drops them amid a kooky story that plays like an elaborate distraction from what little the film actually has to say.",
    "Birdman trades on facile, casual dichotomies of theatre versus cinema and art versus commerce. It’s a white elephant of a movie that conceals a mouse of timid wisdom, a mighty and churning machine of virtuosity that delivers a work of utterly familiar and unoriginal drama.",
    "Alejandro González Iñárritu is a pretentious fraud, but it’s taken some time to understand the precise nature of his fraudulence.",
    "An unrecognizable Michael Keaton seems to have aged 40 years since the last time he appeared on the screen, but he’s still the best (i.e., only) reason to suffer through a miserable load of deranged, deluded crap masquerading as a black comedy called Birdman."

The script is delightful and witty as he cleverly uses magical realism to near perfect effect as he examines the failure and fulfillment of fictional actor/director, Riggan Thomson.\r The protagonist's on screen and off screen struggles whirl around at a dizzying pace as the camera follows him through the narrow shabby, sets, halls and rooftops of the theater. Seamlessly the audience slides  along with him from one stormy long take to the next spirited long take.  Skillfully, acted and choreographed, the camera follows the players through the grimy backstage of a broadway play as the fragile production teeters on collapse at every turn.\r The accident ridden production reflects Riggan's internal strife as he teeters on the edge mental breakdown.  Haunted by inexorable unconscious voices that foment both his ambition and self doubt, he struggles to be the artist he envisions  . . . if only he doesn't destroy the whole thing himself along the way.  Take this certain \"Best Picture\" nominee roller coaster ride and hold on with two hands.",

Let's start off with the acting: The acting is great, not phenomenal, but definitely deserving of some Oscar nominations. Edward Norton kills it, and gives the best performance in the film, but that shouldn't detract from the other performances. Keaton, Stone, Watts, Galifianakis; all of them are great. The writing is also good, but again, it's not phenomenal. It touches on many different aspects of Broadway, and show business in general, but at times seems corny and unrealistic. Overall, however, the writing is effective, and one of the better aspects of the film.\r Now, the bad part. The shtick of the film is that it is all in one continuous shot. I assume this is because it is a story about a play, and thus this is to give it a play-like feel. However, this ends up making the film messy, and entirely distracts us from what is going on. There are tons of extreme close-ups that after a while get boring and repetitive. We feel like we're almost trapped in this theater, with all these characters, and like we can't escape. Yes, the shots are cool, but they do nothing to progress the story. Thus, they only exist so that critics can rave about the, \"Unique, beautiful cinematography.\" It is unique, yes, but does that mean it is good? As they say, \"...your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.\" If you made a film that was shot entirely using the color Brown, it would be unique, but nothing about that would make it a good film.\r It isn't boring, and it isn't awful. However, it is over-hyped and over-done. It is well acted and written, but doesn't have any more substance than other films that consistently get looked over come oscar season; honestly, the film Bad Words has just as good of writing and acting as this, and I can guarantee you it will earn approximately zero Oscar nominations. Don't even get me started on the ending, where the film completely could have redeemed itself, only to flush that opportunity down the toilet in exchange for an ending that, while UNIQUE, entirely doesn't answer the questions proposed throughout the film.",

With a dazzling 360-degree choreography that follows around the characters throughout all events that happen, \"Birdman\" offers a compelling, witty story around a washed up superhero actor who invests everything into his self-produced broadway play as he fights his inner and outer demons that torment and mock him and strives to prove his true worth as a artist. Michael Keaton undoubtedly deserved his oscar; he was the excellent choice for the lead role Riggan Thomoson, as his honest down-to-earth performances truly was, in some sense, a mirror image of himself back when he struggled as an actor after his hit film \"Batman\".

I've only seen one Broadway play (Pippin) and consider it one of the highlights of my life.\r That should add up to me really loving this film right?\r Oh well...I guess the whole does not equal the sum of its parts in this case.\r Keaton mumbles his way through this film, even when on stage in a play (who mumbles line in a play?). The Magic Realism elements are interesting but seem mostly out of place amongst the grunge of backstage Broadway. The jazzy drum soundtrack didn't so much support the film as it distracted from the film. The play within the film was so briefly shown and so stunted as a plot element that it seemed to me much ado about nothing.\r I didn't hate the film but after having read so many positive reviews from critics I'd say I was immensely disappointed. The critic I now most agree with on this film is Rex Reed, except he thought Keaton's performance was a bright note and I wouldn't even give him that.",

But perhaps he cannot, because he is mental.\r Wrapped around the claustrophobic world of actors, the movie is an exercise in navel-gazing and smugness. I guess it must be a big deal for a Hollywood superstar to prove to his peers that he is not just a money-making machine but also a talented actor.  However, I truly do not care about the hysterics and anguish of Hollywood actors.\r That is why, when Birdman was acclaimed by the critics I already suspected yet another inflated balloon full of nothing.  I waited until I could watch the movie for free, because I was very reluctant to waste money on yet another “Academy-worth” piece of crap and I am very happy I saved my hard-earned money.\r The joke is twice on the audience, because the other theme explored by Birdman, besides narcissist actors, is audience stupidity. Not being the sort of person who cares about superheroes movies, I was nevertheless annoyed by the fact that the public of said movies is vilified by this piece of elitist crap.\rIt is difficult to point out what I disliked most about Birdman, since I hated everything: the overbearing drum soundtrack, characters shouting their lines, the smugness of the whole concept, the patronizing dialogues, etc… I do not even think Keaton was so great in it.\r Finally, it is depressing to notice that the number of movies I want to walk out from is increasing exponentially. After decades of watching movies, what I expect is an interesting story told in an engaging way, but what I find is more and more egotistic directors busy only with producing crap bearing their trademark signature, being it Tim Burton Goth-chic or Wes Anderson smug-naïve.",

Aside from the lovely Naomi Watts and the newcomer (to me) Miss Riseborough, there is very little I could like, let alone tolerate, in this movie.

Emmanuel Lubezki (Cinematographer), Douglas Crise andBirdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance is an American Black Comedy directed by  Alejandro González Iñárritu. This movie is highly appreciative for it camera work and editing. Emmanuel Lubezki (Cinematographer), Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione (Editors) deserves a big round of applause for most intensive care they took for this film as the whole movie looks like a single cut. This style of single-cut making is highly comparable to Alfred Hitchcock's  'Rope' which is an epic dramatic thriller. Although this movie 'Birdman' is touted to be a Black Comedy, it lacks that F*****g comedy because it is a drama based on a drama and what we hear most of the time is 'F**K'. You will get to know the theme of the movie at the pre-climax and it is hard for a common audience to sit 100 minutes listening to the word F**K and try to understand its meaning metaphorically. This story is about an impatient orthodox director cum actor who is trying to make a 60 year old miserable drama to reach this generation audience and believes that, it will  redeem his career. Michael Keaton did a wonderful job and he is the heart and soul of this movie. But the misery is his fight with his own alternative character who is hampering him to be some other who the world really likes. This melodrama is throughout the movie and for a normal cine-goer, it is a painful watch. Do watch this movie if you want to really know how cinematography and editing looks like and if you are ardent fan of Micheal Keaton. Else forget it.",

An exhilarating and inventive movie that has one licking one's lips in eager anticipation as to what will happen next.\rMost of the film takes part in and around a theatre on Broadway. Here, the actors are getting ready to open a new play which is meant to resurrect the career of Riggans (Michael Keaton). After success as a superhero called Birdman, both audiences and critics have been unable to take him seriously in any other roles. He sees this as his big chance to prove them all wrong. For Keaton, it could be said, life is imitating art. However, here he has never been better. Dispensing with his usual repertoire of tics and mannerisms he is a revelation giving possibly the year's tour de force performance. This is deserved Oscar calibre stuff. Sentiment doesn't come in to it.\rHe is surrounded by an intriguingly eclectic bunch of top class actors who add a fantastic dynamic to the overall picture. Edward Norton and Emma Stone shine the brightest and both have knockout scenes, but Andrea Riseborough, Naomi Watts, Amy Ryan and Zach Galfianikis are all equally exciting.\rDirector Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu demonstrates a firm and confident hold on the material and pulls of an amazingly innovative feat by making most of the film look as if it has been shot in one continuous take. The reality is that visual effects have been at work. Never the less the result is sensational and left me awestruck at the sheer bravado on display.\rThe two hour running time flies past and whilst enjoying the brilliance of the actors and the maturity of great writing and technique, one is also able to applaud the wonderful cinematography, effective sound and the inspiredl, but perfectly fitting score.\rIt's also refreshing to have a superhero movie that is most definitely about something other than explosions, noise and special effects.

My film is brilliant, the rest are crap.\r While there are strokes of brilliance and humor in \"Birdman,\" the sum effect is ennui and shock at the narcissistic disdain the director holds for audiences.\r The plot is simple enough: a huge action star (Keaton) refusing to add another franchise film to his resume attempts to break away by mounting a pretentious, overstuffed play based on Raymond Carver's writings. A coterie of malcontents and neurotics abet Keaton. Using an experimental brush loaded with mysticism, surrealism and existential angst, Iñárritu follows the on and off stage drama in one take. (Acclimating to the lack of cuts takes a few moments, but an unbroken shot does not really add to this story just as it failed in Hitchcock's \"Rope.\")\r The good is aforementioned. Unfortunately, the bad tilts the scale way over.\r Partly meant as commentary about the nature of art and distilling culture to the lowest common denominator, the director beats a dead horse, resuscitates, and then beats it to death again.\r Add commentary about the craft of acting on stage and film and stumbling upon success.\r Ironically, those who are drawn by this big budget art film have the sophistication to realize the message already. Those who wouldn't see \"Birdman\" on a bet, the audience whose nose elitist Iñárritu tweaks, will never receive the message. Why should they? People like what they like, and if they like cotton candy let them go forth and eat. Only one with a huge ego – this director – would have the temerity to call anyone on their preferences.\r Then add narcissistic, whining actors portraying every showbiz cliché while the film spools on and on and on.\r Then add the irony of effects like those in frowned upon action tentpoles are what made the single shot possible in \"Birdman.\"\r The actors bought into this story. They give it their all and do good work, particularly Edward Norton. However, Zach Galifinakis proves he's out of his depth outside man-child roles for which he's best known. One wonders if Galifinakis was cast to prove the director's corollary.\r Slow, boring, distasteful and insulting does not offer a pleasant experience.

After seeing the horrible and over-hyperd Boyhood and the lackluster Gone Girl, this was a much needed glimmer of hope.\r This film grabbed my attention from the get-go. It was a mish mosh of arthouse, big-budget, independent but with a theatre feel to it. I was about 5 mins in before I had to ask myself, 'Is this all one shot?!\"  The film flowed scene to scene effortlessly, giving the feeling of one continuous shot, a remarkable feat by director, cinematograher and editor (all deserving of awards). It gave a sort of theatre atmosphere to the film that brought you into their world and made you feel like a fly on the wall, observing but not intruding.\r The dialogue was well-written and the acting performances all around were top notch. Michael Keaton is phenomenal, as he portrays an actor in the twilight and dwindling years of his career, trying to stay relevant and risking everything to do so. His alter-ego subconcious plays a significant role in his psyche that appears to affect the world around him. It gives us a glimpse into his world and allows us to better understand the character.\r You can easily tell that a lot of planning, consideration, care and thought went into making this film. It's not a gimmick, but an amazing accomplishment by everyone involved in the making of.  It's not a movie that needs to be explained or defended, it stands on it's own, delivers a clear message, but still leaves a little personal interpretation for the audience.\r For those of us who grew up with Keaton films, there's the added nostalgia and links to his film past as the Batman and his alter-ego (Birdman) almost as a Beetlejuice feel to it. I can't say enough good things about his performance, watching him reminded me of what real acting should be and I have no doubt that his co-actors raised their game to this new standard.\r The arthouse-like score blended the film together from beginning to end, giving a more anxious feeling and sense of urgency, appropriate to the scenes and story. There were few slow spots in the film, but were necessary for the audience to relax before bringing us back into the moment. The SFX were very well done and again, major kudos have to be given considering this appeared to be a single shot throughout (I'm still blown-away by it).\r NYC was the perfect backdrop; the landscape and sounds virtually took me there and for 2 hours I forgot I wasn't.\r This is a must-see film for anyone (except those who only like $200 million Michael Bay action/explosion-porn movies). Easily in my top 5 of all time",

The concept of the movie is absolutely fantastic and it is certainly a film about art and artists, a classical literal theme transferred to the screen with such masterful skill that you can't help but admire the art.\r It is a brilliantly devised black comedy, full of sardonic humor but also a very specific viewpoint that allows the viewer to look into the mind of an artist, in this case both the actor and the director, as the border between the movie and reality, between what is actually the plot of the movie and what is the artistic idea of Iñárritu, is very fluid, sometimes even non-existent. Iñárritu actually utilizes a theatrical method, a characteristic of modern theatre, thereby destroying the classical border between several aspects - the film itself, the viewers, the director, the plot and the idea. It is a metaesthetical analysis of the visual arts and Iñárritu realized it masterfully.\r The acting is also a very strong aspect of the movie. All of the actors fulfill their roles brilliantly, but you cannot escape from the magical interpretations of Edward Norton and Michael Keaton. Norton, one of my favourite actors, is absolutely amazing, is a cynic and a bohemian, a master of the theatre enjoying the praise of a master actor, of a true artist positioned above the more popular yet artistically weaker Michael Keaton, whose Riggan Thomson is trying to revitalize his career and find true artistic meaning through the theatre, an institution so familiar to Norton's brilliant Mike Shiner. It is an absolute shame that Norton found himself alongside the brilliant J.K. Simmons this year (a sure victor at the Oscars), because he undoubtedly delivered an Oscar-winning performance. The same goes for Michael Keaton, who, in addition to that, certainly delivered the role of his career. His Golden Globe-winning performance is an absolute hit, in every way adapted to the idea Iñárritu envisioned with this film and certainly an internal battle for Keaton himself, who had to wait up until now to deliver such a dramatically and artistically strong role. Riggan Thomson is a psychologically polarized actor, an ex-star realized through shallow superhero roles, looking to prove to the world and to himself that he is wroth something, that he is actually an actor. His internal struggle, his obsession and his self-devouring psyche - all of them brilliantly portrayed by the excellent Keaton who managed to give us a look into a very specific mental construction (I thought to myself - now I finally know what went through Heath Ledger's mind before his tragic death).\r Iñárritu has also presented us with a very specific aesthetic in 'Birdman', a very gentle approach to the technical and visual realization of the film combined with a series of surreal elements that wonderfully add up to the concept itself, thereby creating a magnificent blend only a few selected directors can create.\r To conclude, 'Birdman' is truly a wonderful movie with a very specific set of exceptional strengths that are masterfully combined with a strong crew and a powerful idea. It is a surrealist retelling of a psychological process often foreign to the common viewer, but nonetheless amazing and wonderful.",

With stunning performances all around, excellent writing, big laughs, and stunning direction this is a must see.\r The biggest area where it succeeds though is that it speaks to everyone. We all want to feel loved and important. Special even. That force inside of us that drive us to achieve that feeling is the driving force behind this film. It's also the force that drove all of this film's characters to edge and said \"it's up to you from here. Make the jump or fall and die.\" It's an emotional complex and intelligent film.\r The way it talks about movie goers attention spans and what succeeds at the box office is sure to step on some toes. Yes, big blockbuster action movies do get more attention than more thoughtful dramas like, but what's the big deal? We pay for entertainment so shouldn't we get that rather than being bored out of our minds while some filmmaker preaches at us for two hours? While some of it's messages seem a little pretentious the film is unbelievably aware of this and even calls itself out on it. Regardless of how you feel regarding writer and director Alejandro González Iñárritu's views you can't say the film won't get you thinking.\r What about what he has to say in regards to reviews? The labels we put on people's work. It certainly points out how hurtful and meaningless the reviews of both professional and us wannabe reviewers can be to the people behind what is being reviewed. It is our right to tell how we feel about a piece of entertainment, but do we have to be so darn cruel about it? Especially to those with a different view than our own?\r This fim brings up plenty of interesting topics that you will dwell on for quite a long time if you have any interest in movies outside of shear entertainment factor. However all of that intelligence Birdman shows ultimately results to nothing if the movie isn't enjoyable to watch. Luckily the movie succeeds. With captivating performances all around, particularly from Keaton and Norton, and absolutely hilarious moments this is one that will keep comedy fans rolling on the floor with laughter. You also really begin to care about these characters and their plots as the film progresses. Before it's over you are emotionally invested.\r Did I mention the soundtrack? Jazz has never been better utilized as far as I'm concerned. The special effects are awesome. They add a sense of craziness and unpredictability to the film. You never know when Keaton's powers are going to show up and put a whole new spin on things. They are used to excellently capture the character's insanity.\r Birdman succeeds in just about every category. You may be able to predict a certain plot element that takes place near the end (you know exactly how Keaton's character is going to end his play before the big reveal), but for the most part it's an unpredictable ride. One with hilarity and originality all around. Simply put, this is one you should highly consider seeing.\r I give \"Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\" a 9.3/10.",

The film gives a deep and painfully honest portrayal of the nature of stardom and fame, as well as the growing fear of irrelevancy that we all face. Michael Keaton was magnetic. I can't work out why he didn't win an Oscar. He deserved it! The rest of the cast were also brilliant- Emma Stone, Edward Norton and Zach Galifinakis were just a few of the mesmerising performances in the film. The cinematography was excellent. The only real gripe is that some of it was a bit hard to understand- I became a little confused about which parts were real and which parts were the main character's hallucinations. Still, it was a brilliant and often funny film that truly deserved the Best Picture Oscar. Overall, a great movie.",

In addition to the challenges of the show and confrontations with his family, he's in constant conflict with the shadow of the superhero that made him a star. As expected, Keaton is outstanding, but the rest of the cast turns in rich and nuanced performances (Emma Stone is a revelation). What makes this film so brilliant is director Alejandro González Iñárritu's inspired vision. It's shot as one continuous take, which is not only a tech challenge, but creates a sense of fluid time and continuous stress. A slightly surreal, constantly compelling and richly realized combination of personal drama and theatrical send-up.",
