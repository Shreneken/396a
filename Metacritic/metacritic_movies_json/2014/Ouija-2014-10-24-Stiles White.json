  "summary": "A group of friends must confront their most terrifying fears when they awaken the dark powers of an ancient spirit board.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "In the current economy, Monopoly makes a more appropriate board game upon which to base a horror movie, but for what it is, Ouija is better than expected.",
    "First-time director Stiles White's effective use of long takes and director of photography David Emmerichs's wide-angle digital cinematography make an otherwise generic teen ghost story unexpectedly atmospheric.",
    "Ouija is confident, meat-and-potatoes horror, and that’s a lot harder to pull off than it sounds.",
    "It’s endearing how this glorified haunted-house movie tries to reclaim all the old tools, and do so with a straight face and a PG-13 level of violence.",
    "Given its double burden of being both a toy adaptation and a bloodless kiddie horror show, Ouija winds up being more fun that you might think, even if it's the sort of film you can't really take seriously for a second.",
    "Though Ouija starts off evoking a nicely eerie atmosphere of dread, it ultimately goes too far, making the liminal space between the spirit world and this one all too eye-rollingly literal.",
    "The film is effectively scary, filled with plenty of jump moments and a few slow-burning scenes, but the scares aren’t enough to balance the poor writing and lack of imagination.",
    "This silly but straight-faced supernatural thriller manages to elicit an occasional shudder in between cheap jolts and false scares, emerging as a feat of competent direction (by debuting helmer Stiles White) over derivative scripting (by White and writing partner Juliet Snowden).",
    "Within the pungent field of other wide-release scare jobs and films derived from cardboard-based time-killers for kids, Ouija stacks up relatively well, thanks to its look and a confident performance by Cooke.",
    "It’s professionally produced but completely uninspired.",
    "It says a lot that the grossest moment involves a character flossing—no gag, just flossing. Likewise, the candy stuck in your teeth will be the only thing that lingers after the credits roll.",
    "The most pressing issue with Ouija is that Stiles and Snowden cannot seem to write a single interesting line of dialogue. They volley between conversational banalities and whatever exposition might be needed to get the film to its next scary setpiece.",
    "Cooke, a young Brit seen on TV’s “Bates Motel,” is strong as the diminutive brunette at the center of the interworldly fright-fest. Her charisma is almost enough to keep you from rolling your eyes at the script.",
    "It is harmless, frighty fun for teenage audiences, but adults will leave theatres with their bejeebers intact.",
    "Directed by Stiles White, whose credits lean more heavily in the special-effect arenas, Ouija is bland, safe horror for those who like their scares nonexistent.",
    "The ghost scenario that this boring, CW-ready, \"Scooby-Doo\" gang uncovers isn't nearly as shocking as the blasé attitude they have toward friends dying off.",
    "What Ouija lacks in wit and originality, it makes up in volume — a trademark of the “Transformers” director Michael Bay, who is one of the producers.",
    "In the absence of anything truly original in the screenplay he co-wrote with Juliet Snowden, director Stiles White vainly attempts to ratchet up the tension with a series of cheap jump scares fueled by loud noises that are the cinematic equivalent of shaking hands with someone wearing a joy buzzer.",
    "A deadly dull and overly familiar movie about summoning ghosts that draws upon nearly every horror movie cliché.",
    "Ouija has something wrong with it from the first five minutes.",
    "The film consistently settles for the cheapest shock devices and the most shopworn totems of our current neo-gothic moment in the genre.",
    "Hasbro’s long-lasting occult board game gets its own starring role in a film that makes those other recent Hasbro plaything adaptations – namely \"Transformers\" and \"G.I. Joe\" – look like triumphs of subtly engineered cinematic magic."

The movie is low on gore because it is PG-13 but the movie didn't have to be rated R and gory to achieve its thrills. The acting isn't oscar worthy but that is because the movie features young actors who serve their purpose. The actors haven't starred in many movies but a thriller such as this doesn't require world renowned actors. There are enough jump scenes in this movie if you are into that in a horror movie. I thought I would enjoy this thriller and I did. I expected it to be creepier and more psychological than it is. The trailer lead me to believe that the movie would be creepier and gorier. I was disappointed overall with the movie but it is still worth a viewing. Ouija sends creepy vibes to the viewer and there are some neat tricks that the director used in the movie. The characters are lead astray and once they are tricked this leads to their demise. A decent thriller with some drawbacks but no flaws that impair the enjoyment of the movie.",

It looks like I have to talk about it.\r The good things in this movie: Nothing good at all.\r Now for the bad things in this movie: Is this movie scary? no it is not, because this movie has nothing new and nothing to stand out, it just ends up being a water down horror film that doesn't take any risk. The acting in this movie was so bland and so dreadful, I see nursery kids act better then the people in this movie. The character's in this movie are so stupid and really uninteresting, and in every bad horror film there just to get killed off or fill out the screen time with their awful acting. The script, the directing and the way the movie is shot is so poorly done that I could have directed this movie better and more interesting.\r Overall Ouija is a water down horror film that only tries to scare you but the movie has I said before has nothing to live up to and that's way it fails hard.",

For what Ouija lacks in originality, it makes up for with a flawless plot line and endless jump scares that had me clutching my friends throughout the entirety of this showpiece. Some of the best acting i've ever seen, particularly the protagonist Luigi whose acting left me anxious, terrified and curious to watch more - the emotions I simply can't explain. Many people critique the quality of acting in Ouija - it's clear that these people are ignorant, unable to grasp the complexity and skill required to perform such parts as Debbie whose entire group of best friends are slowly killed by Luigi\r Ouija isn't just a movie, it's an experience. I have no choice but to give this film a 10/10. The next time you're looking for a movie to watch, why not Ouija? You're missing out if you don't\r \"Good Bye!\"",

The locations, the deaths, and the jump scares all give it a \"been there, done that\" vibe. It's not scary in the slightest. Every now and then a movie like this will at least be mindlessly entertaining, but that isn't the case here. You've seen all this movie has to offer before and it was way better then. This is definitely for the young and the dumb.\r I'm amazed at this movies ability to make the jump scare tactic even less effective. You know when, where, and how it's going to happen. You won't flinch in the slightest. There's no tension and thee is darn sure no fear. The ghosts look so unoriginal it's painful. This might be the least scary horror movie I have ever seen.\r The plot and acting are just as bad. Tension build up is nowhere to be found and everything plays out exactly how you would expect it to. It's painful watching these \"actors\" try to look sad and depressed at the death of one of their friends. It doesn't even use the Ouija board to good effect. It's just your generic haunted house crap.\r The only value it could have had was if you were a teen on a first date. Young, hormonal teens are the only ones who could have derived any enjoyment from this and that would only be from what came after the movie. However that only applies to when it was still in theatres. So what would be the point of watching it now? Maybe you want to try and scare your friends at a slumber party? All this would do is put everyone to sleep and ensure they never come back to your house for another one. Just avoid this crap. With no scares and entertainment value at all it isn't worth anyone's time.\r I give \"Ouija\" a 2.2/10.",

Produziert Popcornpapst Michael Bay einen Horrorfilm, passt das also. Doch was mit Michael Bay’s The Texas Chainsaw Massacre glückte, aber schon mit Freitag, der 13. in die Hose ging, nässt in Ouija – Spiel nicht mit dem Teufel die ganze Garderobe durch. In Stiles Whites unschlagbar klischeehaftem Geisterhorrorfilm nutzt eine Gruppe aalglatter Teenager das berüchtigte Ouija-Spielbrett zur Aufklärung eines verdächtig plötzlichen Selbstmords – und erhält alsbald tödliche Botschaften aus dem Jenseits. Anfangs zahm, aber angenehm spannend und dabei schick bebildert, gerät Ouija – Spiel nicht mit dem Teufel schnell zur peinlichen CGI-Orgie mit durchweg vorhersehbaren Schocks.",

I have never used it but some of my friends with a taste forThe Ouija board is probably one of the most mysterious instruments of spiritualism, and its ease of acquisition makes it specially appealing to teenagers who likes the supernatural. I have never used it but some of my friends with a taste for these themes have used it or know it well enough to ensure that its not a good idea to use it. Here, in Portugal, its better known as \"Jogo do Copo\" (literally Game of the Glass, because the triangular pointer is often swapped for a glass cup that has to be broken after the game). Basically, my friends told me that any spirit or demon can answer the call and deceive the players, and the board is the source of several possessions or supernatural disturbances. I don't know if that's true, I'm telling what I've been told, but I will not pay to see if it's true or not. As the people use to say here, \"prudent man has died old and suspicious man is still alive\". But let's talk about the movie, that's what matters.The film begins with a good horror premise: an Ouija board that is at the origin of the mysterious death of a young woman. The problem is that the whole plot that develops later is of an awful predictability. In terms of scares, the film also fails roundly. Neither the usual sound and visual tricks were able to make me jump from the seat because I was able to foresee them. The tension, usually compulsory in a horror film, is so absent that it can make us fall asleep. The characters are empty, devoid of personality or some feature that makes us like them, and that makes it indifferent whether they live or die. Some are truly stupid and we just don't care about them. The cast is composed of actors with no talent or experience, who deliver wooden performances, unrealistic and without remarkable merit. Finally, its necessary to talk about CGI, visual and sound effects: although the movie is visually regular, the computer effects are very boring and low, probably because of the low budget.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nIt's not enough to call the creators of this film lazy, because even a half-witted lazy person could achieve a mediocre film. I think the people behind this film must be lazy AND stupid. This is what often happens when directors fancy themselves as writers and pay their chums to write a screenplay with them.The actors don't seem to believe their own reactions, which become more and more flat as the film progresses. Laine in particular appears less and less engaged and interested in the increasingly incredulous scenes. Maybe she took up the use of mind-numbing sedatives to blunt her increasingly desperate self questioning of \"Why oh why did I sign up for this joke of a film?!\" Well, the director and writers obviously didn't care about the film, so why should they? \"Is there a presence here?\" they ask the Ouija board, while trying their best exude as little presence as possible themselves, silently hoping that their low impact approach to acting will make them invisible enough, so that people will forget that they were ever associated with this crime against film. The characters have no individual characteristics to the point of being hollow. The dialogue is so shallow and unrealistic that it made me laugh out loud and never allowed me to get immersed into the story. A good film IMO has a solid story delivered by decent actors, and makes me forget that it's a film. Ouija with its repetitive, inconsistent plot twists, parades a sign of \"I AM A (BAD) FILM\" in every scene. It's as if the \"writers\" were following a bad screenplay guidebook, hell-bent on using every rookie technique ever invented. Characters state the obvious, they say things that sound unnatural just to reveal information to viewers in a vague attempt of back story and they are suddenly experts on certain things. Without any explanation, Laine is suddenly sure that \"Mother is angry\". When Laine and Debbies bf find pictures of the people who used to live in Debbie's house, Laine's bf stiffly proclaims: \"Judging by these pictures, they were taken in the late 40's, early 50's\". Lol, who talks like that?! Certainly not a leather jacket wearing teenage college student, who is apparently also illiterate, because he has to call Laine over to read aloud the article he found about these previous tenants (an article which of course was the first one he found immediately on typing the words into the search engine of his laptop). And mental granny offers no logical reason for her advice of cutting the stitches off DZ's mouth in order to drive away the evil spirit. The highlight of stupidity is when Debbie's spirit appears in the final spirit battle, complete with triumphant background violins.The trailer resorts to false advertising to trick punters into wasting their time and money on this children's film, which shouldn't be allowed to be categorized as horror. The good reviews here must be the result of paid affiliates and 12 year olds.",
