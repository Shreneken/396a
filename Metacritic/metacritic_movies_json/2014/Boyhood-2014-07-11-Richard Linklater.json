Starring Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette as Mason's parents and newcomer Lorelei Linklater as his sister Samantha, Boyhood charts the rocky terrain of childhood like no other film has before and is both a nostalgic time capsule of the recent past and an ode to growing up and parenting.

    "critic_reviews": [
        "There\u2019s not a great theme, a great performance or even a great scene in Boyhood. But I think it might be a great picture.",
        "The greatest movies, the ones that stick with us, are those that hold up a mirror to the human condition and reflect something back at us that we too often manage to overlook. Boyhood is one of those movies, and with it Linklater proves he is among the best practitioners of that art.",
        "The film would be incalculably different if the lead role had been divided between two or three young actors for a conventional shoot. But Linklater\u2019s patience allows us to see a thoughtful personality being formed both on and off the screen.",
        "A home movie of a fictional home life, an epic assembled from vignettes, Boyhood shimmers with unforced reality. It shows how an ordinary life can be reflected in an extraordinary movie.",
        "I'm as reluctant to stop writing about this movie as I was to stop watching it: At 166 minutes, it flies by, and you don't want to leave that world. But one thing is certain: This isn't the last word. People will be writing about this film for years - and looking at it to discover the lost history of our time.",
        "Is it dumb to say, \"Wow?\"...I don't care. Wow.",
        "This bold movie may sound like a stunt, but it\u2019s so much more than that. Linklater is an effortless, genial auteur, and his passions are woven through \u201cDazed and Confused,\u201d \u201cSchool of Rock\u201d and the \u201cBefore Sunrise\u201d trilogy. Here, his mellow groove becomes an everyday rhythm.",
        "In its own quiet way, it\u2019s a world of marvels.",
        "The revelation is Arquette. While the focus is on Coltrane and how he grew up onscreen, it's Arquette that's at the center of this incredible journey. She puts herself out there year after year, getting knocked down and getting up stronger. Her final scenes have the power and heartbreak every parent knows -- it's all about holding a child's hand, then letting it go.",
        "The good news is you\u2019re feeling stuff, you know? And you\u2019ve got to hold on to that. You get older, and you don\u2019t feel as much, your skin gets tough.\u201d This remarkable, wonderful movie helps you remember.",
        "It\u2019s the ultimate time-travel movie into the future, a \u201cflowing time sculpture,\u201d in Linklater\u2019s own words.",
        "Linklater\u2019s film is very much its own hybrid creature. While the dramatic scaffolding is lightly drawn, it becomes apparent that Linklater has organized his material along certain themes, most notably that of the passage of time and the dream life of childhood.",
        "Once in a great while I see a movie I know I\u2019ll be listing as one of my all-time favorites for the rest of my days. So it is with this remarkable, unforgettable, elegant epic that is about one family \u2014 and millions of families. It\u2019s a pinpoint-specific and yet universal story.",
        "As a film that dares to honor small moments and the life they add up to, Boyhood isn\u2019t just a masterpiece. It\u2019s a miracle.",
        "Boyhood is not just a great movie, it's a landmark achievement in film.",
        "Boyhood is a stunt, an epic, a home video, and a benediction. It reminds us of what movies could be and \u2014 far more important \u2014 what life actually is.",
        "In completing this simple, beautiful project Linklater took his time. And he rewards ours.",
        "Linklater\u2019s newest film, a true masterwork, eschews this big-bang theory of dramatics in favor of the million-and-one little things that accumulate daily and help shape who we are, and who we will become.",
        "It seems almost odd to talk of performances when they're as natural and unforced as they are in Boyhood, but they're fascinating, with the adults nearly as physically altered by time as the kids.",
        "I love how Boyhood admits that, in certain ways, growing up stinks. Every character has a least one moment in which they have to heed the advice of Corinthians and put away childish things. None of them like it.",
        "Extraordinary in form, \u2018ordinary\u2019 in content, Boyhood is ambitious, intimate and unforgettable. It might just be the apex of Linklater\u2019s life\u2019s work.",
        "An extraordinarily intimate portrait of a life unfolding and an exceptional, unconventional film.",
        "Living with Mason and his parents over time you feel an intimacy, an empathy, a shared stake. I\u2019m not saying Boyhood is the greatest film I\u2019ve ever seen, but I\u2019m thinking there\u2019s my life before I saw it and my life now, and it\u2019s different; I know movies can do something that just last week I didn\u2019t. They can make time visible.",
        "Boyhood reimagines the coming-of-age film as family album, longitudinal character study, and collaborative artistic experiment \u2014 a mad risk that paid off in a movie that\u2019s as transcendent as it is ordinary, just like life.",
        "One of the most extraordinary films in decades, this family drama is also one of the most ambitious in scope, having taken more than a decade to shoot. Yet it comes across as effortless and unassuming. Boyhood is an epic masterpiece that seems wholly unconcerned with trying to be one.",
        "On rare occasions a movie seems to channel the flow of real life. Boyhood is one of those occasions. In its ambition, which is matched by its execution, Richard Linklater's endearing epic is not only rare but unique.",
        "In Boyhood, Mr. Linklater\u2019s masterpiece, he both captures moments in time and relinquishes them as he moves from year to year. He isn\u2019t fighting time but embracing it in all its glorious and agonizingly fleeting beauty.",
        "Fortunately, Boyhood concludes on a note of such unbridled optimism, Linklater is defying you to leave the auditorium without a grin on your face. Indeed, few will after experiencing this astonishing cinematic treasure.",
        "Boyhood is more than a movie; it is a vibrant, living thing, and it is beautiful, and it is sad, and it is wise, and it is sprawling, and it is intimate, and it is painful, and it is more than any filmmaker could have intended, and, yes\u2026 when it comes to trying to capture truth in a way that cannot be argued or denied or even summarized\u2026 I am sure that nothing will ever be this good again.",
        "There\u2019s a cumulative power here that transcends any rough patches. Boyhood isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s an astonishing, one-of-a-kind accomplishment\u2014and further proof that Linklater is one of the most daring, ambitious filmmakers working today.",
        "Want to know what it's like to be in on the discovery of a new American classic. Check out Boyhood. Richard Linklater's coming-of-age tale is the best movie of the year, a four-star game-changer that earns its place in the cultural time capsule.",
        "Like Michael Apted in his \"Seven Up!\" documentary series, Linklater makes you feel as if you're watching a photograph as it develops in the darkroom.",
        "Boyhood had the curious effect of making me feel lost, uneasy, a little alone in the inexorable march forward \u2014 and also totally, emphatically alive.",
        "Richard Linklater\u2019s Boyhood is an amazing achievement in telling an unremarkably remarkable life story.",
        "As he has throughout his career, from \u201cSlacker\u201d and \u201cDazed and Confused\u201d to the lovely \u201cBernie\u201d to the \u201cBefore\u201d trilogy, Linklater proves himself as a filmmaker unconcerned with flash and dazzle but thoroughly compassionate and empathetic to a wide range of characters.",
        "Linklater\u2019s beautiful film is an extraordinary achievement \u2014 tender, funny, wise and wistful, full of warmth and humanity.",
        "What an astonishing achievement; what a beautiful movie.",
        "It's the selective but cumulative use of seemingly arbitrary but significant experiences that gives Boyhood its distinctive character and impressive weight.",
        "It\u2019s an astonishing achievement. Linklater and his cast, who helped refine the director\u2019s script, perfectly execute how long it takes us to become the lead characters in our own lives, and how fumblingly the role is first assumed.",
        "Unshakable, witty and deeply felt, the film will be paying emotional dividends for a long, long time.",
        "Epic in scope yet unassuming throughout, Linklater's incredibly involving chronicle marks an unprecedented achievement in fictional storytelling.",
        "Like the best of fiction, it conveys greater truth about coming to terms with the world at large, and regardless of whether each individual scene is ultimately justified in its inclusion, the cumulative impact of seeing something resembling a life unfold over a mere two hours and forty minutes is overwhelming.",
        "The profuse pleasures of Boyhood spring not from amazement but from recognition \u2014 from saying, Yes, that\u2019s true, and that feels right, or that\u2019s how it was for me, too.",
        "If the movie is about any one idea in particular, it\u2019s about how parents do their best to stay on top of how their children grow, by taking pictures and documenting the memorable occasions, only to learn too late that most of life happens between the posing.",
        "With Boyhood, Linklater has created an uncanny time capsule, inviting auds to relive their own upbringing through a series of artificial memories pressed like flowers between the pages of a family photo album.",
        "When it's over, the sense is one of deep satisfaction - of having gotten to know a family in a way few motion pictures allow.",
        "Linklater ambitiously shot his new effort over a period of 12 years with the same cast, showcasing what turns out to be an astonishing performance by newcomer Ellar Coltrane, who grows up from 6 to 18 before our eyes over the course of 164 minutes.",
        "Warm, soulful, funny and quietly insightful, Boyhood shines in its engrossing, experiential understanding and it\u2019s a special achievement that should be cherished and acknowledged.",
        "It is interesting even when nothing much happens, which is for most of its 3-hour running time.",
        "Richard Linklater's film is an experiment in time, and one that's attentive to the audience's sense of empathy."

I mean, it's Linklater and it's a 12 year project and it's so frightfully \"well observed\". But did we observe anything interesting, or insightful...really? Come on, really? The early promise that we'd see the boy grow through the emotional impact of divorce and domestic violence and being slightly unconventional, but it never eventuates and ultimately it all just leads to your common or garden teen's self indulgent prattling. There were some terribly clever things going on, especially the editing of the time jumps, and I was always curious to see how the actors had aged, including the next hairstyle choice.\rOn the positive Linklater didn't take us down conventional routes, there was no 'coming of age sex scene\" for example, or any 'teen makes bad judgement call and gets into trouble' scene. But neither has he built any significant conflict. I wouldn't call this film an utter waste of my time, but I've no idea what people are raving about.",

There are certain scenes that make me believe Boyhood would have worked really well as a 12-part miniseries, wherein every episode delves deeper into each year of the 12 years it took to film. Provided it contained more depth, better chemistry between the actors and a clearer focus to the tale being told (that a longer series could have afforded), this would have been a remarkable achievement.\r Instead, Boyhood succeeds as a gimmick. I fail to see how any positive review of this film isn't relying on exactly what the film relies on--the wonder that an entire cast & crew had the patience to take 12 years to film a \"passion project.\"\r And just a project it surely is.",

A boy being devastated after having his mane cut off. A boy debating the necessity of Facebook with his high school girlfriend. In all honesty, Boyhood is a rather apt title for this film. But it could just as well hold the name of another picture currently running in cinemas: Life Itself. That simple yet profound thing is what lies at the core of Richard Linklater\u2019s unique 12-year-spanning story and makes it relatable for everyone, regardless of sex, age group, descent, social status, or character. Linklater lets his audience live through the fun and the pain, the love and the misery, and the excitement and the disappointment of his protagonist Mason with yet another wonderful screenplay in his repertoire and an unspectacular but still extraordinary way of directing.

A seemingly endearingThis film follows the life of a boy from age six to his entry into college at 18. The movie is filmed such that the main character is filmed at age six and is continuously filmed over a 12 year span until he is 18. A seemingly endearing concept however is ruined by the fact that him and his family are entirely unremarkable and they do absolutely nothing remarkable throughout the film. There is no engaging story arc, difficulty to overcome or goal to achieve. For anyone who has lived a life of their own, this film has nothing to offer, no insights or revelations and certainly no entertainment. Certainly there is a reason why films aren't normally made about normal people living normal lives, it's because we live those everyday and don't need a theater or disc to see it. The acting is poor as well. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette do a fantastic job, but the acting roles especially from the children are inconsistent and forced. Much of the dialogue is awkward and out of touch with how youth used to talk as well. With one liner 90s clich\u00e9s scattered throughout. It's a subtly racist film as well. Despite being set in Texas, the one and only Hispanic character is first seen doing manual labor. This movie does have one notable aspect: Because this movie is nearly three hours and nothing notable happens at any point, it begins to drag unrelentingly about an hour and a half in. This movie is however fascinating in one aspect: A movie can be made about unremarkable white people doing absolutely nothing remarkable for nearly three hours and still receive near unanimous praise, critical success and an Academy Award nomination. Bravo white people, even the most unexceptional of you are truly are amazing.",

I liked seeing the actors age and go through their various misfortunes and excitements, or at least the idea of it.  But the movie was frankly too long.  It makes us sit through unpleasant or awkward scenes, and then does nothing to reward us, often switching to uninteresting small-talk, such that my brain began to feel like mush after a while.  Even though real life is typically that way for many, that doesn't make it good film material.  The milestones and aspects of the boy's life should have been hit more concisely.

It's as disjointed a film as you would expect from the way it was filmed over such a long period, it doesn't struggle to be coherent because there's absolutely no challenge in that respect for it to do so. There's nothing artful about the way the film is put together, it's a sequence of moments, which makes sense if you think about the last scene, a scene which tries to make this profound link, like a series of moments with nothing really changing but it feels flat, and again maybe that is the point, that it should feel flat and banal because that's more realistic but the film also tries to be something else by having several linking scenes with sombre indie songs playing in the background, the songs are so tacked on and don't reflect the mood well at all. Whether it's his character or just bad acting, Mason is underwhelming, and so is his sister through most of the film, funnily enough they both seem to act better as young kids, but as they grow the cracks start to show in the performances, I get they have been directed to act as naturally and realistically as possible but it comes across as just awkward bad acting in some scenes, which should have been cut or edited better, the editing was the worst thing about the film, far too many pointless cuts and lingering shots that do nothing, one sweeping shot is so bad it sticks out like a sore thumb. The editing was poor in terms of the sequence of moments as well, it was a basic timeline, but it was put together with no flair. In my opinion the best thing about the film was Patricia Arquette and her character, she was a very realistic mother, and the nuance to her performance reminded me of my own mom, I thought her performance was the best in the film, Ethan Hawke was good as well, and he absolutely carries the scenes with the kids. I don't think it should be viewed as groundbreaking just because ageing happens to the characters, it should be judged as just another film, I was ready to enjoy this film, and I found it relatively enjoyable, and it wasn't that the pacing was too slow, just that it felt monotonous, the film gets better, it has peaks and troughs. Maybe i'm missing the profundity of the understated realism that is the films essence, but it would feel more profound for me if i looked through some of my own family photographs and reminisced, the sentiment was lost on me, I didn't feel it but maybe that's because i have a cold stone for a heart",

No, I did not dislike it because it was long. I don't mind long movies. First, the cinematography is fine, the dad and the mom were great but that's pretty much it. The boy is the most unlikable character I've ever seen a movie be completely about, that wasn't trying to make the character unlikable. The early parts were fine, it had a sense of slow progression but looking back a mere 45 minutes you realize so much had happened since then.\r If anything, the idea behind the film is the best part: watching a boy grow up before our eyes. This is done well. But when the boy is a jaded **** for the majority of the movie (once he becomes a teenager) it's just bad. No matter how much work the crew did, or Richard Linklater, if the movie sucks then it **** sucks.\r I'm assuming people like this movie because of the obscenely high scores it gets and sort of a lemming effect, but I encourage you to look at the movie critically and objectively.\r I saw some people giving it a 10/10 because it had no melodrama, which is okay in some cases, but I would rather that this movie have a bunch of melodrama than the multiple flat scenes with awful writing. I think he was trying to be hip in a few scenes but it just fell flat. The movie has a clear aesthetic and tone, and it's pretty clear what he was trying to do. And I applaud the work he put into it. 12 years is a long time to work on a project. But that doesn't change the fact the kid is annoying, nothing interesting ever happens (even though multiple times it seems like it's going to).\r Another thing I find wrong with it is the fact that it's 3 hours long. Again, nothing wrong with 3 hour movies, in fact I enjoy them more because they usually have a longer and usually more wholesome story (which Boyhood had admittedly). But there were so many points that it could have ended on. There were multiple scenes where I actually thought \"and this is the end I guess, wow that was a great ending\" and then another scene starts. The actual ending itself was actually pretty bad too. They did LSD in a valley or something and then it cuts to black. The car ride to college was a much better place to end. Speaking of which, there were a lot of other things that seemed like they would lead to more interesting things but never did. I won't go into detail in case you still want to slog through it 15 months later.\r My final beef is that every side character that gets only one scene, or is only in it for a short time is intentionally unlikable, but in a manipulative sort of way. The drunk abusing father, the unencouraging teacher, the \"cool\" older kids that peer pressure, etc. Richard created these two dimensional characters to create the illusion of adversity. To make a sense of drama or progression. That he proved them wrong or something. But as I watched it I felt like he was just throwing cliches at me to try and get me to care. There were other side characters that weren't like that though. Imagine how everyone in a restaurant sees you as an extra in the story of their life. But they were also just two or one dimensional, and rarely got any development.\r The family (mother, father, kid and sister) were really the only ones with development. The sister was trash, and only there in the end because she had to be, and was probably just the lesser of the awfulness that is child actors at the beginning who auditioned. The kid was as I said before unlikable and annoying. But the parents actually had some depth and the actors did an incredible job with their material.\r I will end on a quote that I think sums up this movie perfectly:\r \"This is the most true to life movie that's ever been made when you think about it. When you get to the end you just want to die.\"\r-Jay from Half in the Bag",

I could not believe that I had wasted 2 hours and 45 minutes on a film that has accurately represented American mediocrity. I wasn't just blown away by the mediocrity of the film, I was also blown away by the films portrayal of a mediocre family. Do not mistake the intent of this critique, I wanted to honestly and accurately portray what I felt after watching this film. There are way too many things that were decidedly unprofessional, and mind you, I am taking it lightly on the children's' acting. There was one very interesting dynamic of the film that goes far beyond the screen which merits the only point I have to offer this pathetic film. Let us begin this dreadful evaluation.There are many things that make this film disgustingly unappealing. The simple fact that it took 12 years to come up with mediocrity just shows lack of creativity. I did not enjoy watching a portrayal of a mediocre mother making extremely idiotic decisions whilst raising two children. Who still marks the doorframe to check up on height? Samantha using a phone during her elementary school years? That seems like bad parenting, just like the majority of this movie. Who pays money for cursing? While I grew up, if my parents heard cursing no matter where we were, someone was going to have it (I was an only child). Now don't get me wrong, my parents were never \"abusive\". They were aware of how to discipline in a controlled fashion and still manage to create a sense of respect and admiration from me. Next up, collecting rocks? Are you kidding? My parents made sure I never got into dirty habits such as collecting rocks or running around barefoot, or drinking at 15, or even having a cell phone. My parents never went on vacations without me during my developing years, my parents didn't allow me to say \"whatever\" as a response. My father never liked me playing video games, my father didn't drink until I was old enough to understand what occasion I should drink (age 20). Obviously I mention these things because the opposite of what happened to me happened in the film. All the things that you expect from an incredibly clich\u00e9 family is included in the film, such as divorce (multiple). Drinking problems, high school problems, and college problems. If you name the ridiculous fad off the top of your head, it's probably here. Clich\u00e9 divorced dad that give presents to make up for being a somewhat lousy father. Taking your kids to watch a game? Jesus, really? I can't take even remembering the film. Constant moving? Oh woe is me. Abuse? Woe is me. Don't worry I won't need to delve into the leftist stance this movie has, I would rather not stoop low enough as to talk about politics but this film shamelessly did so. Disappointed at father for a bad decision? Woe is me. The teachers advice in the darkroom was insightful at best. \"Seniors having fun\", that quote in my book is like a sin. Getting home late and ignoring advice? I did that once, lived outside for a week afterwards. This cast gave me a small tumor from rage.Finally the only redeeming quality of the film was the fact that they made the story so broad and mediocre that most critics could relate and feel empathy for the film. The only strategy that worked is making the story broad enough for people to relate to it, despite it being complete trash.Final Sentence: Boyhood is a good title because the kid never became a man.",

Definitely 2014 movie of the year by far. I agree that sometimes it can be dull and its a little long, but such is life. You're watching a boy grow up and figure out what he wants to do with his life, especially after some of the experiences he's seen/lived through. The first 30 minutes are probably the worst part of the movie, after that it's really good. I suggest sticking with it. Lots of good quotes all throughout the movie and I feel like it's gotten a lot of praise for accuracy. I'm a little older than Mason but growing up, it was similar. I enjoyed some of the things he did/played when I was younger. Kinda the way Forrest Gump did to baby boomers back in the 90's. I feel it's relevant to call Boyhood \"This Generation's Forrest Gump.\" There's a lot to love in the movie. I'd give it more along the lines of an 8.7-8.8 but figured I'd bump the rating a bit.

It's about a boy living an extremely dull and cliched life. There's virtually no drama that happens throughout the entire movie, and the drama that is presented is still quite listless and unimportant. In other words, this movie is about as plot-less as a movie can get. It took twelve years to film, and yet, those years span by quickly and dully, one event after the other, with no point or order, just chaotic and random. But what makes the movie so dull was the main character.\r In the movie, there is nothing bad happens to the main character, nothing to make you connect with him. There's nothing life changing. In fact, the three biggest \"bad\" things that happen to him are that his mother can't find \"the right guy\" (after divorcing his father, she marries her college professor who turns out to become a drunk, and then she marries one of her own college students, who turns out to have mental stability problems due to him serving in the military; both of which she ends up divorcing as well), and his father sells the car that he had thought would be his when he turned sixteen, and his girlfriend cheated on him, which resulted in their relationship ending. Other than this, nothing happens. He literally goes through life showing as little emotion as possible, just floating by, as though he was in a coma, or constantly tired.\r So, finally, after two hours and thirty mintutes, you come towards the end of the movie. The \"boy\" is now an adult who has graduated high school and who is going to be going to college. Upon him packing his last things, his mother breaks down saying that there's nothing more that is going to happen with her life. That her life has just been a series of events: her having her children, her divorcing her husband, her raising her children, her marrying a man, divorcing  him, raising her kids some more, marring her college student just to divorce him as well, and finally, her sending first her daughter to college, and then her son. Then she concludes with saying that what comes next is, \"[her] funeral.\" To this, the boy, replies that she's off by forty years, \"or something.\" Then she says that, \"[she] expected there to be more.\" The movie then cuts to him driving on the road to college.\r When he finally arrives at college, he meets his new roommate, who is friendly and invites him to go hiking with his girlfriend and another friend (who is also a girl). When Mason (the main character) sees that she's pretty, he decides that he'll go. Before he goes, his new roommate hands him a hallucinatory mushroom and says that by the time they reach the mountains, it will have an effect. It then fast forwards to them walking to the mountains and we see that Mason and the new girl are getting along very well. Then it cuts to them sitting and chatting. Across the distance, he sees his roommate yelling into the wind, and he begins to talk to this new girl, named Nicole, about how we need to, \"seize the moment.\" Nicole replies with saying, \"I think moments seize us,\" and it shows Mason thinking for a moment, and then it cuts to the end credits.\r I think what bothered me the most about the film was the fact that, despite it having no order, there was a point, but it wasn't that great of one. Mason, who lived his entire boring life on coasting mode is finally forced to see that if he keeps doing this, he will end up like his mom\u2013\u2013just living, but not truly alive in the sense of being satisfied with life. The point is that we need to let the moments seize us, and we need to live. Yet, what made this theme so irrelevant was the fact that there was hardly a moment for him to have ever seized! There was no bad, barely any good, nothing that would have made is life have any significant meaning. By the end of the movie, you ask yourself, \"Is my life really this boring?\" And do you know what my answer was? \"No, there's more drama in mine.\"\r In conclusion, if you want to see a long movie that drags on and on about a boy just living his life, then you'll love this movie. Even though it had a theme presented at the end, in my opinion, it just wasn't enough to save the movie overall. It is sad really, because it was such an ambitious project. But by creating such a dull life where nothing happens, I feel that they wasted those twelve years, because in all actuality, most people's lives are far more chaotic and show signs of actual character development due to things that happen, both good and bad, in their lives. That's what this movie failed to do: deliver on experiences that are worth watching. What's left instead is dull, listlessness that fails to satisfy someone who wanted to be entertained. I wanted to see sadness, hopelessness, as well as extreme elation and happiness. To see someone grow into a great person despite and because of circumstances. What I got was boy coasting his entire life though a movie that has a run time far too long.",

I love pretty much all movies, I haven't a specific genre or preference when it comes to film. I had heard much about \"Boyhood,\" and since the Oscars had \"snubbed\" it, I desperately wanted to see it (in no small part to critics claiming that this is the \"Pulp Fiction\" of the Oscars...one of my favorite films). I expected to love it. I expected to walk away from \"Boyhood\" with a respect for Linklater and Arquette. I expected to have been moved. None of this happened. I have since read that this film is \"boring.\" I am so seldom bored that the thought is almost foreign to me. No longer. Boring doesn't even begin to describe it. It is stale and trite. Yeah, I said trite. Doesn't anyone remember \"Before Sunrise?\" Linklater is having the exact same conversation he had in that film only now it's Mason having it with his girlfriend in Texas instead of Ethan Hawke having it in Paris. Please, someone give Richard a copy of \"Being and Time\" so that we don't need to suffer his existential crisis again. The ending lines are precious. \"I thought there'd be more,\" bemoans Olivia. Gimme a break. How many times have we heard *that*? And the icing on the cake, Mason, high with his new college buddies...\"You know how you're supposed to seize the moment...? Maybe the moment is supposed to seize you.\" Wow. Now there are some pearls right there. I get it...he's attempting to explore the \"now\" we all chase...but anyone who has taken philosophy 101 has thought about this. It's adolescent drivel. He's attempting to explore the relationship of time to the audience. Whatever. There are better ways in which to do that, I'm sure. What they are, I have no idea...I'm not a film maker. But this film was such a massive disappointment, I really cannot be bothered to try to come up with a something better. I hated the characters, for none of them were properly developed. Arquette's performance was dry at best. I thought she was almost as painful to watch as the actor playing Mason. So, what you end up with is a plotless film, with no character development, and an aging director desperately chasing this moment he purports should be chasing him. It's a catastrophically bad film. It's symptomatic of a society so muddled with narcissism that we are romanticizing simplicity to a fault. Yeah. Don't waste your time.",

One of the best qualities of \"Boyhood\" is how well the audience can relate to the characters. I found myself transported back to my own childhood while watching Mason grow up before my eyes; whether it was in watching the interactions and typical sibling disputes between Mason and Samantha or just seeing Mason acclimate to the challenges of growing up.

I'm so glad the SAG Awards are coming soon, so I can gauge how it'll do up against some other greats films... I don't think I can stomach the Oscars if Boyhood is a frontrunner...\r Does this film have any rewatchablilty for anyone not involved with the production? Were they any \"positive\" stand-out performances? Powerful moments? Surprises/twists? Engaging story? Characters to care about?\r One last question I'd like to pose...Taking out the fact that all the main actors were available to work at various points within a 12 year period; that is, no one died or decided to quit (though Linklater's daughter wanted her character killed off because she didn't want to do it anymore, to which he said 'no, it would be too powerful for the film' - so instead, nothing happens)... What exactly about his movie was done well or successful?",

Whether it\u2019s in his Before Trilogy which captures the arc of a relationship over a decade or his lighter fare like Dazed and Confused which looks back on our teenage years through the lens of nostalgia, he has shown an uncanny ability to demonstrate on screen the subtleties of how time affects us all. Boyhood, which was shot over twelve years, following characters as the actors that play them literally age, is Linklater\u2019s magnum opus. The persistence and determination of the all involved in the production is admirable and they deserve the attention they are receiving, however what is more remarkable is the film itself. A film so modest, light, and carefree and yet so powerful, Boyhood is the antithesis of the modern Hollywood blockbuster (Interstellar) characterized by their pomposity and heavy handedness. Here is a film that never claims it is telling us anything and yet in the end tells us everything.",

Sure there are some good things, Patricia Arquette for example, but otherwise it's slow, dull, uneventful and boring. It's a nice idea, but the only time in the film where my interest was mildly spiked was when the glass is thrown and maybe the next 10 minutes. Originality does not compensate for the 3 hour waste of time Boyhood is. At even at that Boyhood isn't that original, it's essentially does what a TV series does, only that compressed into three hours, without any significant comedy or drama, with dull and generally annoying characters and a generic story. This is probably the most overrated film ever, it sucked, it was boring and slow and I'm not being petty, I'm not saying that I like it less because of it's critical acclaim, I'm simply saying it's a terrible movie, that may have worked  by being relatable, (although it's so boring even if I could relate I would still want to shoot my TV), and original, but not more than that, it just isn't well rounded, it doesn't have the balance between relatable and interesting, and that is what the goal for this film should have been",

See This Boy's Life.\rWant to see Ethan Hawke's best? See Predestination.\rWant to save 3 hours? Skip Boyhood.\r I loved Before Sunset, Sunrise, and Midnight. But Boyhood is not good.\r DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE.\r Boyhood gets attention for the gimmick of being filmed sporadically over 12 years, so you get to see the kids in the movie grow up. Big whoop. Not an ounce of Hollywood gloss here. The movie goes for realism in the extreme. Homes are dirty, kind of crappy and depressing. It also passes over obvious places other movies would go; it skips cliches. No the step dad does not try to sexually abuse his step daughter. Which was a breath of fresh air. But it also crosses a line of being too realistic in terms of having no real plot. For awhile there IS kind of a plot as the mother deals with a difficult domestic drama. But after that the film sprawls. Example. The dad (minor spoiler, nothing big; probably you'll read about it in any review) seems not entirely to have reached closure with his ex. Maybe is considering getting back with her? But suddenly the movie cuts; it's years later; the dad is with another woman and has had a baby with her. I don't know about you, but between those cuts there might have been some good drama, but it's just skipped. Despite the title, the film dwells on every family member, so it's not like Ethan Hawke is a minor character. Yet they pass over a giant life event.\r Minor spoiler is now over.\r Yes stories should flow from character, but there should still be a story. Character reveals itself through the crucible of a crisis. Aside from the drama early on with the mom's domestic issue, there is no crisis here, and no story. When Hitchcock was asked what he thought of slice-of-life stories, he said he preferred to give people a slice of cake. I left this movie hungry for that cake. And besides, so-called slice-of-life stories, the good ones, do have a crisis. It's just that it's subtle. We didn't get that here.\r There is no depth of the boy's life plumbed here. Just sketchy skit-like scenes semi-related.\r Another point. Aside from Ethan Hawke, no one in this movie seems to have a positive attitude about anything ever. It's one thing not to be Disney, but this movie mistakes chronic maudlin negativity for drama. A story requires conflict. But much of the activity in this film doesn't rise to the level of actual conflict. Instead it's just a manifestation of some kind of low grade depression that never quits and slowly grinds down the teeth on the gears of your spirit.\r Even though the movie is too realistic, in other ways it is too unrealistic. There is oddly stilted fake sounding dialog in the first 20 minutes or so. Also, the son (the \"boy\" of the title) encounters adult men who act exactly the same toward him all the time, step dad, teacher, boss, all of them criticize him in exactly the same way, and that's all they do. You could switch out the dialog for all these guys. They are all the same. Except Ethan Hawke. Another unrealistic thing. When the boy finally lands a girlfriend, she just happens to be one of the most beautiful women you've ever seen in a movie. This pimply pug nosed boy, without athleticism, brilliance, money, or particular promise, gets a girlfriend who probably would have thought herself too good for a young George Clooney. It's ridiculous. And they were going for extreme realism?\r In my own life growing up I encountered some real weird sh!t. So did friends. They say 'sh!t happens' for a reason. But if this is supposed to be this kid's life, either they skipped over that type of dramatic stuff or he had one heck of a mundane childhood! Also, these people seem to have no center. If they have values or principles or beliefs, that's skipped over too. There is some banter that might try to be passing for philosophy but it amounts to nothing of substance. Yes as an adult paying bills and just trying to survive, you don't go around espousing basic values every day of your life, but these people seem so empty inside, as if they are animals that just happen to be able to speak. There's something off-putting about them from my perspective. They are not like people I have ever known.\r Ethan Hawke does a good job acting in Boyhood, but why did he agree to do it? Predestination, his other new movie, is sci-fi, but it's also a study of character as revealed and developed through a protagonist's response to a crisis. It is stellar, brilliant, the best of the best. I am chalking it up on my list of the very best films (of any genre) that I have seen. It will be right beside Before Sunset on my BLU Ray shelf. Predestination raised Ethan Hawke in my estimation, and even Boyhood, which I saw a short time later, cannot bring him down entirely. So let me divert you dear reader. See Predestination.

It inspires and exhilarates. It is poignant and uplifting. Boyhood celebrates life like no other and examines its often obscure meaning.\r The film chronicles the fictional life of Mason from age five to eighteen. The plot follows his coming to age and the turmoil it often brings. This film is unique when it comes to story telling because it was filmed over the course of twelve years. This allows the film makers to experiment like no other and exemplifies to its audience the real time that passes in between scenes. You watch as Mason matures and you develop a deep connection with him that is almost universally unrivaled by other films. I became so engrossed in his character that the nearly three hour run time felt like mere minutes.\r Boyhood is brimming in high quality. Richard Linklater directed this film flawlessly. His direction highlights the emotion of  the film and projects life into it\u2019s characters. Linklater\u2019s screenplay also perplexes the characters and is filled with memorable dialog and subtle wisdom. The combination of these elements defines the film and its soul. The assembled cast is also top notch. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette star, and newcomer Ellar Coltrane plays the title role of Mason. The chemistry between the actors is unmatched and it only continues to evolve as the film progresses.\r Boyhood is a celebration of life, from its triumphs to it\u2019s heartbreak. It inspires us to live and as the film so eloquently put it \u201clet the moment size you\u201d. Boyhood instills its soul into every frame. It teaches us that life worth living. It shows us that beauty is all around us and we simply just have to let go to experience it. Boyhood is unlike anything that has proceeded it and likely unlike anything that will follow. It is revolutionizing in every sense of the word and is undeniably the best film (thus far) this year and possibly of this decade.

Boyhood is in that rarefied air of the latter. It is important to define what Boyhood is as much as what it isn't. This is not your typical movie of cliff hangers and shocking revelations. This is not a movie of searing performances and of acting the part of some highly unusual character ala Rain Man or Raging Bull. This is clearly not a movie of escapism and triumph of good over evil.\r This is the movie that Terrence Malik was trying to make when he made his artsy inscrutable Tree of Life. This is an easily accessible story of life in all of its reality without a single bit of artifice used to tell the story. This is also a movie trying to be shown and told through a boy;s eyes. Scenes that are shown and are memorable because that is what would register in the child's eyes at that time and place in their life. The authenticity documented by taking 12 years to film it and accept the changes in the world that would have to fit the storyline can not be replicated in a traditional movie.

There has to be some empathy and connection to what you see on screen that is relatable to one's own experiences. This movie is more then a passive watching experience, this is a mirror into ourselves and what the passage of life means to us. The beauty of this movie is that it doesn't have to be the son who you relate to, even though he is the focus. You can be any of the immediate family or none at all and still connect in a visceral way to the characters.\r Linklater didn't tell the story of just a boy, he told the story of us all and what can be more engrossing then watch a filmmaker take the time to take snippets of our lives and put it on screen in his own imitable style.

(I do that at bad movies.) THE CONCEPT IS GREAT! Good job! That's it! Like others have said about it, if I wanted to watch a movie about life I'd strap a cardboard box to my body and view things through it like it was a TV set. We all enjoy reliving experiences outside of our own life, like in driving games when you decide you want to actually drive the speed limit and use your turn signal, BUT IT GETS BORING REAL QUICK! This movie is not only extremely boring, but inconceivably pointless. \"Oh but they had abusive step dads!! That's dramatic!\" The first step dad spent 5 minutes in one scene talking about chores and overacting his drunkenness. In another scene, the main character talked about why he didn't like Facebook for ten minutes. The acting is atrocious across the board, except for when Ethan Hawk plays a more respectable middle aged dad towards the end. Every line was forced and seemingly read off of a cue card written from a script that I feel like one of my old depressed Navy friends never finished.\r There is literally only one scene worth mentioning that can be considered well written: The first time the main character comes home late as a teen, he arrives at a small party that his mom and new (second) step dad are having. The step dad says \"Do you know what time it is?\" At this point the viewer believes that there's going to be a fight, but when the main character says that it's sometime after midnight, the step dad says \"Happy birthday.\" OF 3+ HOURS of horrible writing, THAT ONE SCENE is the only thing remotely well written and heartfelt!\r People, I'm doing this as a public service because I spent 20 minutes of the movie googling on my phone why this film got good reviews. Don't be roped in by this nonsense. They did a great job taking 12 years to film something with all the same actors, I'll give them that. Unfortunately, they couldn't time travel forward to see how horrible those actors would become.\r Do yourself a favor and spend twelve years with an actual human instead of Boyhood. It will probably be way more interesting and will seem a lot less shorter than this movie.\r Rating: Garbage\rFavorite line: \"I'll email these to everyone!\"",

It's not, by any means, a bad film, just not nearly as good as most critics claim it is. The problem I have with this film is its glaring lack of substance. There is not a single character in this film that goes through some kind of character arc. The minor changes they undergo are left obscure and there are no hints as to what brought about those changes. None of the characters are likable. The entire film almost is a passive observation of this family's uneventful progression through the years. Although that worked very well in the first half of the movie the second half seemed superfluous. It brings back some of the most overused cliches (honestly if I had a nickel for every time a movie showed the divorced dad as cool and buff and the divorced mother as the complete opposite). The kid actors are great but as they age they seem less and less convincing. The dialogue as well suffers from cranky and mawkish moments. And on top of all that it lacks lacks a narrative structure. If you look at the Tree of Life, which is just as unstructured, Malick took advantage of that and turned it into a meditation on human behavior. Boyhood didn't even attempt to achieve anything of the sort. Tree of Life was poetry; Boyhood is just product. All the reviews I've read so far seem to be obsessed with the concept of the film rather than the final result. To me, Boyhood is yet another film that didn't come close to justifying its overblown hype.\r Re:Edit: But now that the hype has settled, I do agree that it's a great film. It explores the notion of growing up, our ethical definitions about what is right and wrong and the truth behind the social \"code\" for well-being. Mason (Ellar Coltrane) starts of as a young boy who enjoyed spraying paint in the corner of streets and collecting arrow heads. As the film continues he grows into a deep and thought-provoking teenager who's obsessed with understanding human behaviour, the significance of our actions and the value of life itself. He's able to express his emotions though art. Ethan Hawke's character grows responsible and matures as the film progresses. His conversations with Mason transcend from talking about the next Star Wars movie to understanding the purpose of life and living. Patricia Arquette is very very good as the mother obsessed with the idea of \"fixing\" her family through marriage (and she does marry men of all sorts). She grows up to realise that chasing the conventionality of society is a pipe dream and does not lead to a better life. On the contrary it's a burden to her and her children for the most part.\rLife doesn't have to be perfect. It just needs to be lived.\rThe true genius of Boyhood is how it's able to juggle all these characters, in one go and still provide them depth, clarity and most importantly an identity.\rAt the end of the movie. Nicole asks Mason if he believes in the expression \"seize the moment\". Mason replies, \"It's the moment that seizes you\" and he's absolutely right.",

That said: 'Boyhood' is now my new favourite film. This film allows you to see your own efforts at parenting through the eyes of the children Mason and Samantha who are virtually powerless as their parents make mistake after mistake and force changes upon them - moving state, moving school, moving adults in and out of their lives - the children just gamely get on with the changes in their lives as best they can. One of the film's many strengths is that the four central family members are all depicted as good decent people who are 'Just winging it' as Ethan Hawke says. This film is perhaps a work of art in that an entire fictitious childhood has been created and filmed for us to witness. And just like in a real life, a slight occurrence can be surprisingly moving: seeing your child in his graduation robes, or being acknowledged for 'just being there' and seeing the project of parenthood through.
