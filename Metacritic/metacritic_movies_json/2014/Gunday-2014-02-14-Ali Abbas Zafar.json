    "critic_reviews": [
        "The action's top-notch, the songs are good, and with the above-mentioned assets, \"Gunday\" is an unqualified success on its own terms: a solidly entertaining pop movie.",
        "The film has been skillfully realized as a commercial entertainment on a huge scale, and it is often surprisingly beautiful.",
        "Gunday, directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, may be preposterous, but it\u2019s rarely dull. And when Mr. Khan and Ms. Chopra are on screen it\u2019s something more. It\u2019s downright enjoyable."

Ranveer and Arjun are styled differently \u2013 they are quirky and don\u2019t mind flaunting their hot bods, you won\u2019t mind the weird outfits. Priyanka\u2019s closet doesn\u2019t do justice to the era in which the film is set. But then again, why complain, hai na? She\u2019s hot and why should boys have all the attention, right? Ali Abbas Zafar has done a great job with his cast. It\u2019s certainly worth watching \u2018coz Gunday isn\u2019t a serious film which makes you leave the theatre with a heavy heart and neither a typical masala entertainer nor \u2018the happily ever after\u2019 kinda rom-com. Gunday is different and we love it!",
