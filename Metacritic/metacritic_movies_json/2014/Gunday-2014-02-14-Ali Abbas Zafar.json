  "critic_reviews": [
    "The action's top-notch, the songs are good, and with the above-mentioned assets, \"Gunday\" is an unqualified success on its own terms: a solidly entertaining pop movie.",
    "The film has been skillfully realized as a commercial entertainment on a huge scale, and it is often surprisingly beautiful.",
    "Gunday, directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, may be preposterous, but it’s rarely dull. And when Mr. Khan and Ms. Chopra are on screen it’s something more. It’s downright enjoyable."

Ranveer and Arjun are styled differently – they are quirky and don’t mind flaunting their hot bods, you won’t mind the weird outfits. Priyanka’s closet doesn’t do justice to the era in which the film is set. But then again, why complain, hai na? She’s hot and why should boys have all the attention, right? Ali Abbas Zafar has done a great job with his cast. It’s certainly worth watching ‘coz Gunday isn’t a serious film which makes you leave the theatre with a heavy heart and neither a typical masala entertainer nor ‘the happily ever after’ kinda rom-com. Gunday is different and we love it!",
