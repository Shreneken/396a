  "summary": "Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller), a young jazz drummer who attends one of the best music schools in the country under the tutelage of the school’s fearsome maestro of jazz named Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), struggles to make it as a top jazz drummer.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Marches to the beat of its own drum… Lands with a bang… There just aren’t enough musical clichés to describe Whiplash. A masterclass in technique, power and rhythm, it stings and sings like nothing else.",
    "Sum up the plot and it sounds interminable. Watch the film and it will spit you out elated, exhausted and cheering for an encore.",
    "Whiplash is, at its core, about jazz -- that smoothest, mellowest of American art forms. But don't let that fool you. Writer-director Damien Chazelle's impressive sophomore effort is about as rock 'n' roll as a movie about jazz can possibly be.",
    "Teller plays notes all over the emotional chart, dovetailing into a divine riff on ambition. And he does nearly all of Andrew's drumming, aggressively and impressively so.",
    "In a stunning performance, Teller resists the impulse to sugarcoat Andrew’s egocentricity. Simmons is equally impressive, lending Fletcher just enough humanity to render his monstrousness all the more shocking.",
    "At Sundance, Whiplash quickly picked up the nickname “Full Metal Juilliard” on the basis of scenes in which Andrew, plucked from a late-night practice session to be the orchestra’s drummer, is raked over the coals by his new mentor. Horrifying as they are, these sequences are dazzling exercises in total humiliation.",
    "Whiplash is true to its title. It throws you around with impunity, yet Chazelle exerts tight, exacting control over his increasingly feverish and often weirdly comic melodrama.",
    "Even if you couldn’t care less about jazz drumming, though, Whiplash is a thrill to watch. Underneath that taut, stylish surface, it’s really a movie about the perils of pedagogy, about the relationship between a passionate (perhaps too passionate) student and a demanding (perhaps too demanding) teacher. Which is to say, a movie about a uniquely powerful and potentially destructive form of love.",
    "Whiplash is cinematic adrenalin. In an era when so many films feel more refined by focus groups or marketing managers, it is a deeply personal and vibrantly alive drama.",
    "It is one of those scorching films that burns through emotions, uses up actors, wrings out audiences. And the jazz, well, it has its own moments of brutal, breathtaking fusion.",
    "It also happens to feature a pair of performances that eclipse all else around them.",
    "The exhilarating, inventive and suspenseful story hinges on a pair of commanding performances.",
    "More \"Full Metal Jacket\" than \"Dead Poet’s Society,\" the film is an epic battle of wills between two fanatical artists, one doing everything in his power to painfully make a master out of the other.",
    "A thrilling and propulsive drama.",
    "If you can appreciate the sight of two totally dialed-in performers simmering until they boil over, that's enough. And P.S., that's pretty much the definition of jazz.",
    "The script and Simmons, known for TV’s “The Closer” and as tantrum-tossing editor J. Jonah Jameson in “Spider-Man,” make Fletcher a monster, and then look for ways of explaining him.",
    "Although a couple of narrative twists late on threaten to drum us into melodrama, Chazelle never misses a beat and the film builds to a cathartic crescendo.",
    "However genius may flourish, you know it when you see it, and Whiplash is it.",
    "Revealing both the dangers and payoffs of artistic ambition, Whiplash is sure to establish Chazelle as a directorial force to be reckoned with.",
    "This is a muscular and accomplished work of kinetic cinema built around two tremendous acting performances, and it’s really about teaching and obsession and the complicated question of how to nurture excellence and where the nebulous boundary lies between mentorship and abuse.",
    "The last act takes a couple of turns that rely too heavily on coincidence, but overall Whiplash (the title comes from the name of one of the songs the band plays) hits very few sour notes.",
    "Thanks to Whiplash, Simmons will lend comfort to those actors who believe that, if they wait long enough, the right role — their role — will come along. Fletcher is such a part.",
    "Whiplash redefines the teacher movie (to say nothing of the young-musician movie) with a brutal energy and no easy resolutions. It's a challenging tune that will nonetheless get stuck in your head.",
    "As a go-for-it music movie, Whiplash is just about peerless. The fear is contagious, but so is the jazz vibe: When Andrew snatches up his sticks and the band launches into a standard—say, Hank Levy’s “Whiplash”—it’s hard not to smile, judder, and sway.",
    "It may get a few things wrong, but it aims at, and finally achieves, an authenticity at once more exalted and more primal than mere verisimilitude.",
    "Chazelle proves an exceptional builder of scenes, crafting loaded, need-to-succeed moments that grab our attention and hold it tight.",
    "Whiplash is writer/director Damien Chazelle's hyperventilated nightmare about artistic struggle, artistic ambition. It's as much a horror movie as it is a keenly realized indie about jazz, about art, about what it takes to claim greatness.",
    "The film’s true subject, though, is innate talent — for music, writing, painting, sculpture, plumbing — and the superhuman lengths we sometimes have to go to in order to wring it out of ourselves.",
    "It's a noteworthy achievement for director Damien Chazelle to infuse a tale about the development of a musician with all the tension and intensity of a top-notch thriller. Whiplash is riveting.",
    "Whiplash is an intense, unmelodious, highly amped and probably unrealistic drama set in the fictionalized Schaefer Conservatory in New York.",
    "The music is brilliant, Chazelle’s writing and directing are something to behold, Teller is really good — and Simmons delivers one of the most memorable performances of the year.",
    "Beat the drums for a Simmons Oscar, and add a cymbal crash for Whiplash. It's electrifying.",
    "The thrill of watching Fletcher and Neyman's fray unfold is intensified by Damien Chazelle's attention to the craft and challenge of musicianship.",
    "[An] unusually unromantic approach to music education is one of many noteworthy things about Whiplash, a funny, exhilarating drama — bordering on psychological thriller.",
    "By far, the best part of the film is the last twenty minutes or so, and it's so good that it almost makes up for some of the missteps along the way.",
    "The quest to be the best is a familiar film story, but if director-writer Chazelle has achieved anything here, it’s a deeply and richly different take on that journey—not only examining the cost of struggle but the reward of it, showing both what it takes to be great and what happens when you don’t have it.",
    "Directing with a cool, steady hand that renounces shaky-cam the way Fletcher would denounce rock ‘n roll, and getting strong performances from his two leads, Chazelle provides a potent metaphor for artistic ambition as both a religion and an addiction.",
    "Teller delivers a career-making performance as Andrew Neyman, a 19-year-old jazz drummer who wants to be great. Like Buddy Rich great.",
    "The film’s aversion toward clichés and hitting expected beats lends it a rare, welcome edge of danger.",
    "It's rare to see a film about music that professes its love for the music and its characters equally.",
    "The antithesis of “let’s-put-on-a-show” fluff, Whiplash...is about the wages of all-out sacrifice and commitment.",
    "Whiplash scrapes the far edge of crazy passion. It never apologizes.",
    "Because Whiplash is two characters in search of a plot, it ramps up the happenstance and improbability as it stumbles toward a final showdown between teacher and student that would be emotionally satisfying if it had the ring of truth.",
    "The soundtrack, full of jazz standards, is an enjoyable feature, though in the context of the movie, audiences will mostly feel anxiety hearing them. The amount of work required to sound breezy and effortless is daunting.",
    "The question is: how much should one talented but sensitive individual be willing to suffer for his art at the hands of one brilliant but terrifying bully? The two stars are fully committed to the concept that the pursuit of perfection doesn’t always triumph, and the film pounds in the temples with the feverish tempo of a jazz riff.",
    "If Whiplash doesn't quite hang together, Chazelle has still managed to pack it with some wonderful ideas.",
    "The leads’ prolonged, puffed-feathers sparring is entertaining while it lasts, but the sensation of something sizable is only fleeting.",
    "The dynamic between Fletcher and Andrew makes for highly pitched drama, which strains for credibility during two climactic scenes.",
    "I don’t get the enthusiasm for this movie, written and directed by Damien Chazelle, which is such a cooked-up piece of claptrap that I half expected Darth Vader to pick up the baton. We’re supposed to think that Terence’s tough love is more “honest” than the usual pussyfooting tutelage, but in any sane society this guy would have been brought up on charges long ago."

Actors Teller and Simmons, who played the roles of Andrew and Fletcher respectively, have shown quality performances as their strong jazz chemistry really left an impression; Simmons's oscar-winning performance as Fletcher is straight out deserved, as he performs his role with utter power and absolute dominance. The plot is packed with tension and drama as the pace consistently gains momentum until it all explodes with a refreshing bang at the movie's satisfying grand final act. With excellent visuals, superb directing, an engaging story supplied by masterful actors, \"Whiplash\" definitely has its place in my top 5 movies of 2014.",

The movie may have a very specific focus and be nothing earth-shattering on the intellectual side, but it's worth several Oscar nominations. The music is fantastic. See it on the big screen.\r As for the controversy around the abusive teacher, I would say that it's not necessary to feel that the teacher is justified or unjustified, good or evil, effective or hindering, in order to enjoy the movie and find interesting food for thought in it. If a semi-vicious teacher who, in the real world, would overstep the bounds of ethics and even effective technique, is a flaw in the movie, then it's not a damning one.",

A good story, excellent casting, and fine direction are the reasons why.  Better known for his TV roles, J.K. Simmons makes the most of his opportunity.\r Andrew (Miles Teller) is a freshman jazz drummer at a top music school.  Terence Fletcher (JK Simmions) teaches the school’s best students, mostly upper classmen, but he is also the teacher everyone fears.  Fletcher’s motto is that good musicians don’t become great musicians unless they are pushed hard to do so, but the techniques used by Fletcher to motivate his students fall somewhere between extreme and brutal.\r Andrew comes from a nice middle class family in the burbs.  Family dinner conversations have a competitive air in which the small college athletic successes of his siblings dominate.   Andrew is driven to succeed as a jazz drummer, but he is also young and impressionable.  He notices that in addition to being a tough teacher, Fletcher appears to also have a caring and a compassionate side to him.  Andrew buys into Fletcher’s belief system and commits to doing whatever it takes to be the best, including making a decision to terminate a budding relationship with his new girlfriend.\r The question of whether Fletcher is a good guy or a bad guy will have you on the edge of your seat until the movie’s dramatic conclusion.  You don’t need to like jazz music to like this film.  The terrific music is just a bonus.  Director Damien Chazelle’s pacing is right on target and a couple of minor plot faults near the end of the movie aren’t enough throw this fine film off tempo.",

Plagued by the failed writing career of his father, Andrew hungers day and night to become one of the greats. Terence Fletcher, an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods, leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, forever changing the young man's life.\r Okay let me just start off with this. You had no idea how much I was really looking forward to Whiplash. This was on my movies to check out list, because I heard nothing but positive things from this movie and I heard a lot of people described this film has the Full Metal Jacket but with no war or guns, but with music and well... drums. I think Whiplash and Birdman was the two movies I wanted to see before making my best movies of the year list, because who knows they might make the list. I haven't seen Birdman yet but will do soon, but I finally had the chance to see Whiplash and my god this movie was just so spectacularly flawless in many ways. Whiplash is the best move of 2014.\r J.K. Simmons in this movie probably pulls of the best performance in he's career. Every word that came out of his mouth didn't feel like he was reading from the script then act it out, no, I felt every angry punch of words that came out of him, because it was real and not fake. I didn't see J.K. Simmons just playing a movie character in this movie, no he was the freaking Fletcher.\r Now let's talk about Terence Fletcher: The best way to describe Fletcher to those who haven't seen the film yet, well his like Gny. Sgt. Hartman from Full Metal Jacket. He has the best lines, when his on screen your locked on and his also like the kind of person that would be somebody's worse nightmare to have for a boss. This guy doesn't just like music, he breaths music and he wants his band to do perfect. His opinion and his look on music is another thing why I didn't flat out just hated him, I actually understood him. He made a very good point about how people will comment on you act and say \"You did a good job\", and yes I did use the words \"you did a great job\", n my past reviews but now I'm never going to use it ever again after this movie.\r Miles Teller was another stand out performances in this movie, and just like Foxcatacher where Channing Tatum was so over looked by his performance, Miles Teller has proved himself to be more then a teen in a movie that will be forgotten and so would he, but no Miles Teller played this character so brilliantly he could become the next big thing. Now his character in this movie has the love of the true art of music and you can see that he will wants to tell people his love for music, but when the harsh life of reality comes crashing into him it's truly heartbreaking to see his struggle and effort just not being good enough, and Teller played this character so realistic and so brilliantly flawless.\r The directing and the writing in this was just....perfect. Damien Chazelle directed this movie and written it and man did he do it with style and passion to tell a story about two strong music buffs battling out and he freaking nailed it.\r This movie also had probably the best finale that I've seen in years. My nails were digging into the seat. I didn't dare to look away not for one moment, not for one second. I was simply locked on and when it was over... I'm kidding you I actually clapped towards the end of this movie. Now the biggest cliche that I always hear from critics when their talk about a different movies and their use words like \"You will clap at the end\", but you don't, or \"You will feel inspired after the film\", and I you don't. But Whiplash actually did make me feel inspirited towards the end and made me clap. It's message of not giving up and the dream that you been chancing for isn't just going to come to you. Movies like Pride, freedom Writers and all that such never ever give me that inspiring feeling inside of me, until I watched this movie.\r For problems: The movie had it slow parts and that's it really.\r Whiplash is a movie that everybody should see. This isn't just a popcorn movie where you come and put you legs up and laugh a couple of times, no this movie reaches out to people out there that have the same problems that these character's have, with their passion of what their what to do in life get's over shadowed by something you don't want to do and this movie get's it right. So go and see if you have the chance.",

Like the seventies film-makers like Kubrick, Scorsese and Coppola influenced a whole new generation with the possibilities of cinema , The above mentioned films have influenced me and hopefully my generation of moviegoers and I hope will continue to do so. The thing about Whiplash for me is that It feels pure. It has razor sharp focus on it's characters and in what type of film it wants to be. Most films these days always feel bogged down by baggage that diminish the experience whether it be Political and sentimental in nature . Not because they're in the film but they feel extremely heavy handed and half baked. This is the sort of film that really gets to me. Films that feel personal and close to the heart and don't preach to you , cater to you or talk down to you.One of my all time favorites.I have nothing to say about J.K Simmons enigmatic performance, The brilliant Script, Miles Tellers resonant lead because it's already been said , they're all Awesome. In the end this is a film That me and many other people have connected to , even though we don't have jazz in our lives , Even though we didn't have a foul-mouthed teacher pushing us, or even though we may have modest expectations of our lives.  that should tell you all you need to know about the film really 10/10",

This movie is not just about the struggle of music student Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) trying to impress the abusive and intimidating instructor Terence Fletcher (JK Simmons), it's actually a lot more than that and it actually has some great social commentary about topics like education and life goals.The Good:-The directing and cinematography are just brilliant.-The acting is amazing, both leads (Teller and Simmons) do a fantastic job.-The script.-The story is entertaining, intense, exciting and emotional.The Bad:-Nothing really bad worth complaining.

Simmons and Miles Teller in this story of a would be jazz drummer and his over zealous teacher/conductor in an elite and upscale music conservatory. Written and directed by Damien Chazille, this is a film that will appeal to lovers of jazz as it represents some of the best musical renditions ever seen on the movie screen. It is also a film that raises the question as to how far a teacher should go to \"bring out the best\" in his or her student. Messrs. Simmons and Teller are superb in the roles they play as they participate in some of the most intense student/teacher scenes one will ever see. Adding to their credibilty, we find out that in real life Mr. Teller studied drums from age 15 and Mr. Simmons holds degrees in voice, conducting and music from the University of Montana. As a result it’s easy to understand the believability of their respective performances. Having myself played in studio bands under the stewardship of a number of quality professors, the film had a special meaning for me. But, alas, this is what may make this really good film a commercial mishap since it is not for everyone and, by its very subject matter, may exclude a significant part of the viewing public. I give the film a 9.0 because, seen out of context and apart from other films, it stands out as a true work of art. The caveat here, though, is that if intense musicology, training and signficant jazz performances are not the viewer’s \"thing\", then this film will not be appreciated by him or her to the same extent as it was by me.",

Whiplash follows the story of a drum player played by Miles Teller. He's extremely relatable as he wants this as his career, and is working so hard to get there; a situation we've all been in. We also see that he is not handling the pressure that well. He's in debt, he's barely paying the rent and is verging insanity. From this we want him to succeed, as we see that he is a good guy, but his incredibly bad luck is just bringing him down; again another situation we've all been in. The humanisation of this character is so engaging that even if there was no plot or dialogue at all in the movie, it would still keep audiences in their seats. But that's not the case. The plot presented before us may be simple, but it's execution is stellar in every possible respect - from acting to cinematography to music; it simply is a masterpiece. The story comes into play when our main character is at the end of his rope and is a mer millimetre away from giving up. However, he gains hope again when he has the opportunity to study in a class taught by this legendary music teacher played by J.J Simons. He gets in, but gets way more than he bargains for. Simons teaching methods are extremely cruel and some what sadistic, using physical, verbal and psychological torture to motivate his students. In addition to this, Simons's performance is absolutely and utterly impeccable. At every given moment some sort of malice is shown by him, making you actually fear what he might put Teller through next. It's easily the best performance of the year and Simons definitely needs to win an oscar. The film also makes you continuously have conflicting opinions on this character. For example, Simons will often say utterly evil yet hilarious things, that makes you question your own morality by finding it funny. But the best thing about this character is how real he really is. We've all had some sort of intelligent, charismatic yet malevolent boss or teacher that we've hated with every morsel of our beings. However, the greatest part of this film is at the end. After around a month of all of this, Simons deems Teller ready to preform, but also warns him that if he messes this up, he will suffer beyond anything he's ever felt. Mix that with excellent camera work and thematic music, and you have one of the most tension filled scenes in the whole of film history. It takes you through the scene at such a methodical, slow pace that just builds an extreme level of suspense. Without a doubt Whiplash is one of the best, if not the best film of 2014.",

However,Whiplash is a real crowd pleaser which had the audience I saw it with clapping at the end. It moves at a cracking pace, has some very smart dialogue and boasts a couple of very strong performances from Miles Teller and J K Simmons. However, it is almost a film of two halves. The set up, and then the revenge. The first half of the film, whilst good, feels somewhat contrived.\r Drum playing jazz fanatic Andrew (Teller) goes all out to impress respected but feared teacher Fletcher (Simmons) in the hope of joining the school band he leads. This he sees as his possible route to becoming one of the jazz greats. However, he hasn't bargained on the outrageous teaching methods employed by Fletcher which includes humiliating and even attacking his students. Their fragile interaction puts them on a collision course.\r Both performances are undoubtedly excellent, but Teller really has the more difficult role and stands tall against Simmons more obvious grandstanding. As the cruel and foul mouthed Fletcher, Simmons shouts, swears and screams a lot, much in the vein of an army drill instructor, but these outbursts sometimes have the effect of appearing phony and calculated, merely there to elicit laughs or rouse an audience. Like wise, Teller's acquisition, and subsequent ditching of a girl friend, and scenes of him pushing himself on the drums to the point that his hands become blistered and bloodied, strike false notes. Again,they feel like plot contrivances which, although demonstrating sacrifices made on route to success, actually feel included just to provide fuel for the film's better second half.\rThe final half hour is very satisfyingly concluded as the two actors dual it out to thrilling and nail biting effect. The film also benefits from a  great jazz score which permeates throughout and the film is briskly and imaginatively edited.",

You know when you want to go up to the screen and punch the bully or wrap the bloody fingers of the one being bullied that some strong acting is going on in the film.\r The film starts with a drum solo and ends with one while in between you will be mesmerized by J. K. Simmons as musical conductor/teacher Terence Fletcher and a student of his, played by Miles Teller, Andrew Neyman. (By the way if a conductor has the arms that Fletcher has from conducting I am signing up immediately.)\r Fletcher wants the best from his students in the hope of finding another Charlie Parker and Andrew wants to be a great, if not better, drummer than Buddy Rich and both will do whatever it takes. Fletcher abuses his students verbally and physically calling them names, throwing things at them, screaming in their faces. He is every Marine Drill Instructor who will grind his charges into the ground to get what he wants.\r There are at least a minimum of 2 scenes that you will forget to breath and at least 1 scene where you will gasp out loud. There is no doubt both men will deserve nominations for all and any awards and right now they deserve to win! I don’t know if Teller did his own drumming but if he did he deserves recognition for superb drumming.\r The supporting players from Paul Reiser as Andrew’s father to Melissa Benoist who Andrew pursues, and then drops because she interferes with his drumming, along with the other students who play or compete with him are all topnotch .\r The music from the title song by the late great Hank Levy plus standards like “Caravan” and new music by Justin Hurwitz are all presented as jazz should be. It took me back to the jazz clubs on 52nd street, and in the Village, along with the sets at Birdland that I use to go to in New York City.\r The direction by Damien Chazelle is spot on and in his writing the screenplay he leaves out a few logical things but enhances the movie with a short 1 hour and 46 minutes.\r “Whiplash” is a winner all the way.",

The acting is great with J.K.

All of this makes it so frustrating when the film gets to the third act.

Everything about this movie isSince \"La La Land\" is out in theaters, I thought I would take a look back at Damien Chazelle's big hit of 2014. And man oh man is this something. \"Whiplash\" is an intensely electrifying drama that never lets up. Everything about this movie is spectacular thanks to unique editing, a great script, and performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons that really elevate the movie to a whole new level. Without their chemistry, the movie would not be even close to what it became. It is a movie that questions how far you are willing to go to achieve your dreams. The movie presents its ideas in such an unflinching way that it draws you in with its intensity. There were moments in this movie that legitimately made my heart race. Most action thrillers now of days don't come anywhere close to giving me that same effect. Now that is saying something. From beginning to end it continuously builds and builds to a remarkable climax that was so satisfying to witness. It's the kind of underdog ending that was just so well deserved. Overall, Damien Chazelle has a made one of the best movies not only of the decade but of all time. I give \"Whiplash\" an A+!",

I played and performed jazz for a decade or so, but certainly not at this level. The music and the performers are quite credible; I had expected to learn later that Miles Teller knew nothing about drums and was just a really good faker as in most music films, but it turns out he is a drummer and did take intense training for this movie, and that authenticity strengthens the film.\r The point of the movie though, is asking whether a high-stress teaching approach is a good thing or a bad thing. The director's behavior gets intense, and I do struggle to imagine that someone could get away with the things he does in the twenty-first century. It is, however, a provocative issue nonetheless. The way I read into the film, it's up to you to decide the answer to its thesis question: is this aggression and confrontation and abuse necessary to achieve at the highest level, or is it unnecessary? What's not in question is the pain, the question is whether it's worth it.\r The trailers present the film as a twist on the schmaltzy teacher and student films we've been cursed with. If you're waiting for the other shoe to drop, if you're waiting for this film to abandon its central question and go back to the safe, boring narrative of an omniscient unflappable teacher and a student who just needs to get over himself and put his personal issues aside and then becomes instantly perfect, this movie never reverts back to that. I'd say that's a good thing.",

Miles Teller (playing Andrew Neiman) and J.K. Simmons (playing“Whiplash” is initially a captivating study about what it takes to be great and what is needed to become great, and it ends as a captivating study about what it is to be great. Miles Teller (playing Andrew Neiman) and J.K. Simmons (playing Terence Fletcher) are both absolutely fantastic in their respective roles and their performances are on par with those I loved witnessing in “Birdman” and they fit perfectly, as “Birdman”’s cast did with that films respective themes, with what “Whiplash” is all about.\rGreatness, as I mentioned earlier, is what “Whiplash” is all about. Teller’s and Simmons’ drive reflect this, and it comes through in their characters. Andrew wants to be “one of the greats” and Fletcher wants to be the man to coach one of them. Yet this is certainly the absolute minimum of what I gathered about this film before I saw it. This kind of drive is in motion about halfway through the film, and “Whiplash” has several twists and turns in it before it finishes. Teller and Simmons develop extremely complex characters and what you come to realise is that what makes them complex is their drive. Andrew for example is an initially very easy character to understand and in some ways, to relate to. We’ve all wanted to be better and get great at something. But what takes “Whiplash” in a different direction from the one where we see Andrew asking the girl behind the counter at the cinema out is Fletcher. He pushes Andrew beyond “what is expected of him”. Watching Teller develop Andrew as a character is a fun ride although Fletcher swearing, slapping and throwing cymbals at him is not so much, but it’s all for a reason.\rBut is it necessary? Fletcher believes so, calling it “an absolute necessity” in a scene where he seems to reveal himself as the grand villain, right beneath our noses this whole time. “Whiplash” asks these questions and it’s almost as if the film sprouted from them, not that they came up and were developed as the film continued to shoot. Andrew and Fletcher’s relationship is an attempt at answering them, leaving it up to you whether the answers “Whiplash” puts forward are right or wrong. Are Fletchers methods the way forward? Could Andrew harness his talent and be great without Fletcher? Did Andrew have the talent to do such a thing? Is talent even a realistic construct? “Whiplash” asks all of these questions, and puts forward its answers here.\rOf course Teller and Simmons are fantastic too and deserve the nominations they are getting. Simmons character is particularly well developed (and funny too) and again it is a joy to witness Teller’s development. Neither character can be described really. Simmons seems describable but there seems to be something beneath him that I couldn’t figure out and in one scene we see that he isn’t quite as tough as he seems to be. What surprises me though is how Simmons keeps winning awards and Teller does not. For me they are both brilliant and one does not outdo the other because in “Whiplash” you come to think of them as entirely separate individuals, and their relationship is instead an eternal one in regards to how it can be applied to several examples and asked whether it is one required for greatness.\rWhat’s also worth mentioning is the films score. It’s brilliant. It really is just a complete appraisal of Jazz.  Drums of course predominantly feature and although the score is not as good as “Birdman”s, again heavily featuring drums, the reason it is not is because the score in “Whiplash” is external and in “Birdman”, it’s internal, inside the cast’s heads. It has meaning and something to do with the film whereas in “Whiplash” it’s almost as if Jazz music and the drums in this case are being used as a way by which we can see Andrew become great. It’s another eternal concept of sorts.\r“Whiplash” is definitely worth seeing and although I wouldn’t quite call it the film of the year, it certainly puts forward a good performance in several categories and has done well considering it was shot in 19 days and adapted from a short film. Most should come out saying “Whiplash” was a good film. It’s tense and has some good performances in it and asks questions, and talks about, greatness. It’s visually tense as well, helped along by slow-motion shots of sweat bouncing up and down off cymbals and blood dripping from a hand. Because of this, it was an utter relief, and felt hard-earned in some respects, to see the films ending.",

In time, I began to realize that it depends on a series of factors, which in turn depend on another series of factors... and ultimately - the answer was no. But from this night onward, if I ever find myself in doubt again, I will certainly reach out to \"Whiplash\" to remind me that the answer is indeed no.\rNot often does fate grant me the privilege of experiencing a movie that I want to watch again immediately after I've watched it the first time. Such was the case with \"Whiplash\".\rThe biggest surprise to me in this movie is the work done by Damien Chazelle (who has a rather unexceptional track record up until now), a name I even wrote down to remember, in hopes that he can maintain producing such wonderful works. Other than directing, cinematography has been superbly executed to it's fullest. Hence - my introduction; \"Whiplash\" does not offer a particularly deep or meaningful story, but it is a story very well told, very firmly blended with the craft of film making. This is the main reason \"Whiplash\" instantly became one of my all-time favorite movies - it is beautiful in it's simplicity of story, without sacrificing narrative.\rMiles Teller and J.K. Simmons show off astounding acting and chemistry. Never have I though that a movie with a concept such as this can be so breathtaking and intense (often enough at the same time).\rEverything about Whiplash beyond this point cannot be expressed by words. If the concept of \"A Boy Is Learning To Play Hardcore Drums\" is not intriguing to you, still you must give this a chance, because it's about that, but it manages to be so much more (as a film) within that. It establishes it's borders and finds freedom within. And that freedom is beautiful.\rThis is 2014's best flick and I recommend it to everyone and anyone interested in good, quality cinema and acting.",

Shouldn't Fletcher be in jail? How is he walking free. Moreover some of his actions don't even make sense.

Simmons is terrifying, and really great. He plays a manipulative, abusive teacher that every student fears and longs to please.\r Lots of times movies with music as a central theme have fake playing in them that is distracting. This movie is filmed in such a way that the fake playing isn't distracting. In fact, if you don't know better, you won't know the difference.\r The story has a ton of interest and holds your attention. There are quite a few shocks along the way.\r The Negative: Plot holes...plenty of them. One or two are acceptable...but they became a distraction.\r I wish they would have explored the family dynamic more, especially attitudes favoring sports over music.\r I think they wrote Simmon's dialogue a little over the top. Yes it had to be shocking...but it was like \"Full Metal Jacket\" shocking. Over the top in my opinion, and subtlety would have been better here.\r The final scene was unrealistic and stupid. Made a great movie just good.",

Teller and JK Simmons reminds me of the quote in The Dark Knight 'This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object' Teller is shown to sacrifice nearly everything for a chance at the top, his family, his girlfriend and will go through hell if there is a slice of heaven. JK Simmons plays not only the tough guy but the guy that will push 99 percent of his students to breaking point. His acts even with honourable intentions can't even be justified but that is what makes his character such a stand out. He believes that what he does no matter how bad of a person he seems to be is not for him but to find the one percent that don't break from his hurling insults but rises. Whiplash is easily one of 2014 great films and will stand the test of time for not only music movies but movies as a whole.",

This movie is nothing but an old plot with a new costume, one that adds a hip/cult aspect to it and will extract good comments from posers who want to look hip and cult. Very superficial though and get bored when you watch a movie that does exactly what thousands of movies have done before, don't bother watching.

Cons: plot line wobbled on credibility, (surprisingly) performance of Simmons as the domineering band instructor. I was in the mood for a test-your-dream story set in the music world, and Whiplash delivered. The basic story arc of an ambitious musician finding what he's made of in the New York performing arts world is delivered in workmanlike fashion. Ultimately, however, I did not fear Simmons as the instructor, and thought too much of his dialogue was re-worked from the drill instructor in \"Full Metal Jacket.\" Here, I may have been the victim of high expectations, given the Academy Awards. The drumming performances were quite compelling, at least to a non-expert such as myself, and drew me in to the history of jazz, with Buddy Rich and Charlie Parker key icons of the shared values of the main characters. I thought the final act was a little contrived to arrive at a Hollywood climax, resulting in the pacing of the story becoming more uneven. Ultimately, if this movie rates universal acclaim, then \"The Paper Chase\" would as well, and I don't think most critics would put the latter in cinema's top echelon.",

There hasn’t been a musical movie, or any movie for that matter, that gives such intense human relationship. The film brings a rich drama performed by engaging actors, it is crude in its nature but also possesses classy rhythm. Its mix of true to live cinematography and brilliantly pace musical score is edited so well, audience can’t help to be drawn to its excellent tension.\r Andrew Nieman (Milles Teller) is a drummer and student in one of the best music schools. He’s recruited by Terrence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons), a well-known teacher who’s searching for a new musician to join his band. Nieman is a very dedicated young man, he strives to win Fletcher’s approval but little did he know that Fletcher’s method of teaching is rather unorthodox. The way Fletcher motivates his students is with a lot of profanities, overly honest assessment and borderline abusive behavior. Lots of stick with barely any carrot.\r The two are embroiled in an odd relationship, and both leads perform magnificently. Milles Teller represents the youthful ambitious character with hidden aggressive poise. Whereas Simmons as Fletcher is brilliantly antagonistic, he’s a mentor but often time he resembles a manipulative enemy. From his body language and yell Simmons is too convincing, it could be unnerving at times, in the best possible way. If he had the opportunity like this in old Spider-Man movies as he portrayed the pushy editor, they would have been truly amazing.\r Camerawork captures the flow meticulously and mostly in close-up, it often pans back or slowly approaches the scene, allowing the audience to have a sense of the setting. However, when the music hits, it goes into high gears. Switching back and forth between the plowing of the drum, characters’ subtle expressions or winces, down to the blood and sweat. The film’s editing is wonderfully fitting, each frame is also accompanied by a spirited explosion of instruments. It’s powerful, inevitably engrossingly.\r Whiplash is a monster of a movie, never skipping a beat. Rude, brash but stylishly captivating.",

His acting as the music teacher that pushes students to the edge is absolutely breathtaking, nothing like what I have seen in a long time. This character represents all the obstacles that life puts in front a person that wants to succeed on a certain topic. The work with the cameras really helped to create this figure, staying with details and looking up, at him, or down, at the rest. The problems with this film starts when you look around at the other things on screen; the plot is almost nonexistent, leading to a chaos of nonsense; the protagonist is not well defined, making impossible for the viewer to understand his actions and decisions; and the camera's work that was magnificent at the beginning is lost along the way. So many incoherent things together definitely can't maintain a person's attention, although if you like to hear an hour forty five of drums, this movie is for you.",
