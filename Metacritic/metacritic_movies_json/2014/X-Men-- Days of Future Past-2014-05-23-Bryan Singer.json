    "summary": "The ultimate X-Men ensemble fights a war for the survival of the species across two time periods in X-Men: Days of Future Past. The characters from the original X-Men film trilogy join forces with their younger selves from X-Men: First Class in an epic battle that must change the past - to save our future. [Twentieth Century Fox]",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Once every couple of years, a movie comes along to remind us how satisfyingly complex the genre can be. Christopher Nolan\u2019s reimagining of the \u201cBatman\u201d saga did that masterfully. On a slightly less ambitious scale, so does X-Men: Days of Future Past.",
        "There is action galore, but Future Past is a deeper, richer, more thoughtful film, more existential in its contemplations than earlier Xs, all rather nicely embedded in the mayhem churned up by the mutants' altered states.",
        "The most striking thing about X-Men: Days of Future Past is its generosity. Huge franchise installments are rarely as enjoyable as this one. They aren't as inventive, richly detailed, surprisingly varied, elegantly crafted or improbably stirring.",
        "While it's more dramatically diffuse than the reboot and lacks a definitive villain, the new film is shot through with a stirring reverence for the Marvel Comics characters and their universe.",
        "If the characters\u2019 quandaries at times feel overly circumscribed, they\u2019re also advanced with a bracing emotional directness, devoid of either cynicism or sentimentalism, that touches genuine chords of feeling over the course of the film\u2019s fleet 130-minute running time.",
        "To reboot the X-Men franchise, director Bryan Singer, who first gave these characters screen life fourteen years ago, has crafted a continuity-lover's nightmare.",
        "Step up, cynics, and see the summer 2014 blockbuster that gets damn near everything right.",
        "Think of it as a thrill ride with gravitas.",
        "Thanks to the first-class special effects, a star-packed cast, screenwriters who know just when to inject some self-aware comic relief without getting too jokey and director Bryan Singer\u2019s skilled and sometimes electrifying visuals, X-Men: Days of Future Past is flat-out big-time, big summer movie fun.",
        "Bryan Singer\u2019s whip-smart and witty time-travel romp X-Men: Days of Future Past blows a breath of fresh air through the musty Marvel universe.",
        "Singer threads the needle with such apparent effortlessness in stitching it all together, the seams are practically invisible. It may not be as showy as telekinesis or plasma-laser eyes, but it\u2019s an uncanny gift nevertheless.",
        "I couldn\u2019t follow many of the ins and outs of the time-travel scenario, and I\u2019m not altogether sure that the filmmakers could, either. It doesn\u2019t really matter. It\u2019s enough that the movie is fun. We shouldn\u2019t also expect it to make sense.",
        "Hold onto your hats, True Believers! This one's got the most massive, momentous montage of Marvel's merry mutants ever mashed into one movie!",
        "X-Men: Days of Future Past effectively passes the torch from one generation of socially segregated mutants to the next.",
        "Not surprisingly, the best thing about Days of Future Past is that it's heavier on the days past than future.",
        "It feels like the single most successful attempt to pull the shape of one of the beloved comic stories into the film world. It also feels like Bryan Singer has finally figured out how to shoot an action scene where the X-Men actually look and feel like the X-Men, and where the fantastic is handled the right way.",
        "Days of Future Past is the kind of extravagant production that sweeps you up in a sense of mythic grandeur even as you struggle to follow what\u2019s going on.",
        "This is a smart movie, a treat for fans of the comics and the franchise. And it's a lot of fun.",
        "Singer has refreshed the series with blasts of his original entries\u2019 X-factors: vim, levity, clarity and a sincere, soulful grip on the emotional stakes involved.",
        "With so much going on, and such a ferocious pace, several parts of the story feel undernourished... But what we do get here is largely fantastic.",
        "Ambitious, even audacious, the movie's mix of action and for-devotees-only intrigue can overwhelm, but there are moments of sheer virtuosity, too.",
        "It doesn\u2019t take a lot of wit or imagination to use Richard Nixon as a bad guy, but it\u2019s still satisfying to watch a climatic showdown between two supervillains \u2013 one brought back from out of the past and the other from off the comic-book page \u2013 and wait to see who blinks first. Seems like we\u2019ll always have Nixon to kick around, after all.",
        "\u201cDays\u201d is fast, smart, well-acted, and intermittently inspired, and if you don\u2019t know or care who Beast or Blink or Storm are, you can safely skip it.",
        "Most important, there is an emotional undercurrent in this installment that the earlier films only aspired to. When for a brief moment, the younger Charles Xavier meets the older, there is the sense of time's mystery - and also of the long, magnificent slog of a purpose-driven life.",
        "How could you not marvel at a movie that includes a revisionist explanation of the JFK assassination, a football stadium floating over the White House and the sight of Richard Nixon firing a .45 at a villain in a Christ-figure pose?",
        "Days of Future Past is, in itself, as intoxicating as a shot of adrenaline. It\u2019s what summer movies are meant to be.",
        "The deep cast (look out for a slew of crowd-pleasing cameos) play this borderline-silly stuff so well, there isn\u2019t a single unintentional laugh in the entire thing.",
        "For better or worse, X-Men: Days Of Future Past is the first Marvel movie to truly embrace comics-style storytelling.",
        "Days of Future Past is most everything we\u2019d hoped the summer\u2019s earlier popcorn pictures would be, most of all \u2014 fun.",
        "Spanning across several continents, and obviously decades, Days Of Future Past feels vast and epic in scope. But as large as the movie is, it never loses sight of character and themes (at least the ones that matter).",
        "Even when it seems mercenary and muddled, X-Men Days of Future Past is enjoyable and well-made and actually about character, a necessary shot of adrenaline born of both inspiration and desperation for a franchise that desperately needed one.",
        "He\u2019s (Singer) reborn \u2014 deft, elegant, spring-heeled \u2014 in X-Men: Days of Future Past. The special effects don\u2019t bog him down: They lift the movie to a surreal and more emotional dimension.",
        "As usual, the characters \u2014 and the performers playing them \u2014 step unto the breach to provide just enough wit and feeling to make Days of Future Past something other than a waste of a reasonable person\u2019s time.",
        "I basically really enjoyed this movie, even while lamenting that I was enjoying it under mendacious premises and that there was something fundamentally cynical about its elegiac, retrospective tone.",
        "At its best, Days Of Future Past feels not just like an X-Men comic book, but like an X-Men comic-book crossover... Like Days Of Future Past, crossovers in comics tend to be light on character development. But when they\u2019re good, the huge stakes and epic scale of the action make them hard to put down.",
        "Capitalizes on the audience\u2019s familiarity with the many players and their complex backstories, but never advances the ball down the field, tenders no new thought or wrinkle to the franchise. It\u2019s the difference between a diverting entertainment, and a riveting one.",
        "While there are fun moments and a continuation of the franchise's main idea \u2014 Professor X's peace, love and understanding vs. Magneto's fight the power \u2014 Days of Future Past ends up feeling more exhausting than exuberant.",
        "It's as visually indistinct and paint-by-numbers-plot-driven as most Marvel Comics-based projects, especially the gaggle of recent Avengers-related films.",
        "The movie sometimes has the feel of an Olympic sprinter running in place. There\u2019s so much energy expended to get to one spot. Constant searches beget more searches. It all gets exhausting.",
        "Impressive for the most part without being awe-inspiring, the film's two timelines converge in a much more satisfying and thrilling ways towards the end, where the emotional stakes are considerably upped.",
        "Non-devotees might well give up, but director Bryan Singer always has a neat special effect, a well-timed gag or an action set piece around the corner, whipping up the action towards a symphonic climax.",
        "It only conveys the awesome strangeness of its characters and their universe when director Brian Singer breaks away from the perpetual build-up of the film's unwieldy plot.",
        "Future Past starts fast and never slows down. There's not a line of dialogue that isn't exposition... What fun there is slips in through director Bryan Singer's visuals.",
        "The film squanders both of its casts, reeling from one fumbled set-piece to the next. It seems to have been constructed in a stupor, and you watch in a daze of future past."

An all-star ensemble delivers one of the better and more captivating superhero movie in recent time, despite the use of a rather mystifying time travel plot. They do a remarkable job of keeping the audience invested to the characters, each with brimming personality to ensure there's never a dull moment. Visually, the movie is captivating, its contrast tone bridges the colorful 70s and severely bleak future impeccably. It also appropriately utilizes good humor throughout the seemingly melancholy plot.\r X-Men: Days of Future Past is an ambitious movie, it brings the newer cast from First Class as well as the older trilogy, plus Hugh Jackman. The time traveling gimmick could be a puzzling one, and in some occasions there are tricky twists that rely on heavy expositions. However, the movie pulls it off quite neatly with balanced pacing. The complexity doesn't divert the focus away from relationship of characters, most of which are always in peril. Many of the cast are capable to lead a movie by their own, but the movie doesn't feel bloated because they are so many involved. Director Bryan Singer cleverly seams the characters' tales together; the present chemistry produces engaging interaction between them.\r The bulk of the story occurs in 1973, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence take most of the spotlight. They perform admirably, each showcasing emotional baggage and entwined history together. Hugh Jackman fits into the party fairly well, he has been Wolverine for so long, he just naturally meshes together with the younger X-Men. Peter Dinklage provides a unique antagonist. X-Men movies are notoriously filled with military men as villains, it's nice to see someone more dynamic and with less reliance to violence.\r Effects are done beautifully. The future battles are spectacular, not to mention the choreography gracefully combines the mutants' power into the fray. I personally like the intricacy of Blink's ability which allows her to use multiple portals. Her scenes are few, but very well done. The slow motion effect looks wonderful and melee combat is performed effectively, especially Mystique's acrobatic dances. There's lingering retro ambiance for 70s, a simple touch of familiarity. One minor blemish is the lighting for future setting might be a tad too dark at times to fully appreciate the graphic.\r The prevalent flaw of time travel gimmick is the impact actions supposedly have on the future, this movie is no exception. There are a few instances where characters act rather brashly just in case it may hopefully change the future, a couple decisions are questionable as well, it's hard to believe experienced mutants with special powers would do impulsive action. It also tries to add prejudice theme, but seeing Jennifer Lawrence, even with blue skin, having self-confident issue is like seeing a supermodel complaining she's fat. All the flaws are just little hindrance, they barely affect the gripping performance of the talents.\r X-Men: Days of Future Past is arguably the best of the franchise, it will entertain viewers with exquisite acting, finely pace story and delightfully likeable characters.",

Many times I get confused when someone mentions a scene from this movie, and I'm like, \"wait, it happened in THIS movie? I thoughtI'm gonna be a little too honest here: I bingewatched all the X-Men movies, so I often forget about this movie. Many times I get confused when someone mentions a scene from this movie, and I'm like, \"wait, it happened in THIS movie? I thought it happened in First Class/Apocalypse!\" And I'd prefer admitting that it's my fault than it being the movie's fault.X-Men: Days of the Future Past is what I'd call the movie that bridges X-Men: First Class with the other canonical movies, and at the same time also helps in eliminating the bad movies like The Last Stand and Origins. The movie begins with, as usual, mutants being attacked and eliminated. So to save all of them, Wolverine goes back in time and stop Mystique from killing Bolivar Trask, a defence contractor. Wolverine reached the 1970s, when he was still a mutant without vibranium. And to set planes in motion, he has to find Charlex Xavier, Magneto, Beast and Mystique.Bolivar Trask used Mystique's powers to create Mutant Hunting Robots. In the beginning they were only meant to be used to fight in the Vietnam war, but seeing how Mystique and Magneto revealed themselves, they decided to use the robots to hunt down the mutants itself. They didn't see whether mutants are also sentient beings or not, they just wanted to have them eliminated. And that's when the roles of money and power play. It was on the order of President Nixon that Bolivar decided to make those robots, which President Nixon had ordered only because of Bolivar's influence. So in a way it was a loop of blame.And when Professor X, Wolverine and Quicksilver reach Magneto to save him, we finally get to see the fabled Quicksilver scene, where he takes down all the prison guards single handedly. It was the most iconic moment from the movie, and no amount of appreciation can praise it as much as it deserves. The modern day scenes were also adding to the tension, and in the end when Mystique is left with the choice whether to kill Bolivar or not, it is a quite tense moment whether the mutants in the modern time will survive or not. In the end we see that all the mutants who had died in the previous movies had also come back to life, and the franchise was brought back to where Bryan Singer had left it in X2.Normally it is very difficult to reboot a franchise (read Sonic 06). Not only do you have to understant the major events that need to ve removed in order to fix the franchise, you also have to make the reboot-turning movie really good, otherwise it will just contribute to being the hot garbage that the other movies of the franchise are. And that's the reason why I believe this movie is underrated. It single handedly fixed a failing franchise, joined the acclaimed prequel into the main timeline and became a success both critically and financiallly. It deserves to be one of the most iconic X-Men movies.",

It was just so cool to watch him in action. But if he had stuck around for the rest of the film, it would be too easy.\r Great ending as well - we get to see all the changes in the timeline, and showing Jean and Scott as a small tribute and connection to the original X-men trilogy was nice. But most importantly, the older timeline is still remembered by Logan; so the previous timeline we saw still holds some meaning.\r The good: Great humor - especially with Wolverine. Great action. The young versions of the heroes were handled very well - like making Young Charles a drunk / druggie, so he has something to overcome if he wants to save the mutants. They did a good job with building the characters of the three key heroes - Mystique, Xavier, and Magneto. The chemistry between Fassbender and McAvoy was great just like in \"X-men: First Class\", and I liked how even though they reconcile, Magneto still decides to do things his own way and act as the villain.\r The bad: very formulaic story with tons of exposition. Like Young Charles not wanting to help Logan and then agreeing after a 10 second shot of Raven's picture. Or the X-men in real time being attacked right when Logan is about to succeed in his mission. The plot was incredibly predictable and everything is done by the Hollywood formula. Also, some of the character decisions (primarily Magneto) were pretty stupid - if he had just talked to Mystique after they stopped the assassination, there would be no point for the escalation that followed.\r Overall though a very solid entry in the superhero genre and the X-men series.",

They are pumping out movies nonstop, and in return, money is raining on their heads. Heck, they're now the highest grossing movie franchise EVER now! However, all this   doesn't mean that they rush their movies, nor do they act like they just want money for their movies. They put such care and attention into their films for all their devoted fans. Guess what? X-Men Days of Future Past is just like the other Marvel films in terms of quality, if not better! At the core of every Marvel movie, their true genre is action. One-on-one fight scenes with hero and villain, countless numbers of structures falling down, explosions (not to a Michael Bay degree though), it's awesome action. So of course, DoFP has amazing action with all the X-Men. I loved seeing their mutant powers come to life and then watching in awe as they kicked ass. Speaking of the characters and their powers, all of them are truly brought to life. While the acting is nothing revolutionary, everybody still does a fine job. I especially liked Michael Fassbender's performance as Magneto. He really acts like a menace sometimes (which he will do more than often in the movie), and there's not a better pick for a character that's supposed to be cruel than him. The title of the movie gives you some hints about the storyline, right? Well, what happens is that the world is getting eaten up by the Sentinels, and they are still trying to kill every mutant they can find. The X-Men soon figure out someone must go into the past with Kitty's powers to change what happened. I will not lie, you will have to pay attention most of the time. It wasn't a problem for me, though. While it's not the most original Marvel storyline you've ever heard, it's still interesting enough to keep you entertained. In terms of flaws, I really couldn't detect any. Does that mean it's a 10 out of 10 masterpiece (12 Years a Slave is considered that score imo)? No. Yet still, DoFP is still gonna be one of best Marvel movies you've seen. All these positives really add up into being a great time at the movies. It's worth it. GO SEE IT!",

Thus when I review this, I assume it has relations to previous X-Men titles and since that was the reason I went to see this film, the movie fails. Now the question is how do I rate it? Do I rate it as a stand alone movie? Do I rate it as a horrible sequel the previous X-Men films? If someone wanted to write a movie like this, why couldn't they create a new franchise? Why did they need to milk the X-Men name for a few more viewers and take a chance at destroying the franchise (this is one of two reasons why comics died in the 90s)? There was no loyalty to the fans and the companies made it obvious that all they wanted was money when the fans wanted continuity and a good story.

I didnt see anything new so no bonus points for innovation.\r As an X-Men film following the X-Men continuity of previous films, there are too many plot holes in the story. I wont go into every detail because the list is much too long but here is quick summary.\r 1 - Xavier is alive. Even if we assumed he jumped bodies, why is he still in a wheelchair? Stupid stupid stupid writing.\r2 - Quicksilver could have accomplished the entire plot goal on his own... but he was not brought along for the ride. They just sent him home to watch tv while the world was on the brink of collapse.\r3 - Stryker is not the same person from older movies yet logan remembers him as the guy from the old movie. Note that in both movies, the time is 70's. In the old movie, he was 40s-50s. In this movie he is in his 20s.

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nMarvel is really on top of their film game, with a great Captain America, a decent Spiderman, and now a truly excellent X-Men, all in the same few months.  And if you think about it, they are veritably ruling the film world.  Look at the ensemble of actors in this movie.  Where other than a Robert Altman movie are you going to find a cast of people together like Ian McKellan, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Ellen Page - the list goes on and on.  What's more remarkable is that this cast works deftly together in a film that could have been a sloppy disaster.  Time-travel movies when done right are some of the most intriguing movies ever - but if done wrong, they are excruciating.  Luckily, Days of Future Past gets it all right, and the only drawback is all the expository, supporting dialogue the audience must therefore endure along the way in order to understand it.  The bad guys in this movie are truly bad.  If the Sentinels show up, they are going to kill you, and this is established right away in one of the most exciting superhero/villain fight scenes in any comic book movie to date.  Seeing Colossus become full metal at the same time Sunspot flames on at the same time Iceman (finally) goes and stays full Iceman - a very cool moment.  Unfortunately even these powerhouses are no match for the Sentinels.  The only option is for newly-introduced (but now regular X-Man) Blink to keep them moving around until Shadowcat (with a future developed time/spirit manipulation power) can send newly-introduced Bishop just far enough into the past to warn the team that the Sentinels are approaching - so they can not be there when the Sents arrive.  This is layer one.  Layer two then is this first group combining efforts with the other group (Storm, Wolverine, Prof. X, Magneto) to send someone way back in time to before the Sentinels were even created.  This task falls to Wolverine and off he goes into the second layer (the 1970s, pre-Sentinels) in an effort to stop Mystique from.... wow.  The more I write the more I realize how convoluted this plot is.  It's like trying to explain to a non-viewer what's going on in Game of Thrones.  Pretty soon you just throw your hands up and say, \"You know what?  Just watch it!\"  And so that's what I'll do.  What works in this film is the excellent acting, the dark plot, the nearly-full roster of Superheroes, and the best scene in an X-Men movie since Nightcrawler's debut in X2 (hint:  Quicksilver, and anyone dealing with a Quicksilver or Flash-type character in the future must now contend with this scene setting a certain bar for excellence).  There are a few disappointments.  Anna Paquin will show up as Rogue for a second at the end, and I understand her deleted scene(s) will make it onto a DVD/Bluray version.  But for this primary showing, she's notably and confusingly completely absent.  The action scenes in this movie range from the terrifying Sentinel attacks to the now-typical \"huge Magneto scene\" - this time with him moving an entire sports stadium, to a lot of smaller scenes spread throughout - and they all work.  The special effects are fantastic and nothing feels gratuitous (except when they are going for 100% gratuitous, as in the Quicksilver scene).  The story holds together and the dialogue, while mostly expository, is good.  It's my personal favorite of the series so far (you might be surprised to know that The Last Stand was my favorite until now - typically the one everyone hates - but I'm a sucker for new heroes and villains showing up, and X3 brought a lot of new faces into the series - even if Juggernaut was a huge letdown - the Phoenix climax was epic).  Days of Future Past ups the ante on everything and makes me hungry for the next installment.  I think they're being smart with this series - phasing some actors out and others in - because this bodes well for this being a series with a real lifespan well beyond where we're at now.  If you're new to the series, by all means don't start with this one.  Start at the beginning.  But if you're already an X-Fan, you're most likely going to love this movie.",

X-Men has showed me that in the proper context, with some great writers, superheroes movies don't have to be the lowest form of sci-fi entertainment. Days of Future Past seemed to confuse some people, as it's not part of the trilogy and therefore it's timeline is off. The ending of the film also creates a paradox, which eliminates certain mistakes made in the other films. In layman's terms, some of the things that happen in the other X-Men movies, never happen, because of Days of Future Past. In an undetermined era, sometime between the end of the original film and Last Stand, a new enemy has been targeting mutants. These machines, meant to eliminate the mutants have malfunctioned and are now targeting humans as well. The machines are made with mutant DNA and therefore have the combined forces of all the mutants it's come in contact with, making them unstoppable. The only chance the X-Men have is for one of them to go back in time and stop the machines from ever being built. Wolverine is the only one with a mind strong enough to survive the trip and is sent back to the 1970s, where he meets the cast of X-Men: First Class. While difficult for non-sci-fi aficionados to understand, this film was not only extremely well written, but serves dual purposes for the series. First, it brings both casts together in an extreme fashion and it's a tremendous gift for the fans. Second, it allows the writers to undo mistakes from The Last Stand, which was at the time, set to be the final X-Men film. The ending to Days of Future Past, effectively explain that everything that happened in Last Stand, never happened, as it was part of an alternate timeline. This allows the writers to bring back characters like Prof. X (who is seen killed in that film) for possible future films. It really was an ingenious move for the franchises future, but it also allowed fans to experience the \"old timers\" and the \"new class\" working together, in a huge, diverse, and very impressive cast. Seldom are superheroes films so complicated or as well written as Days of Future Past. The writing is out of this world, the cast is full of stars, and the special effects were absolutely amazing. Love it or hate it, superheroes are part of the science fiction genre, but Days of Future Past was simply incredible and for that, it's our latest must see movie!",

Make it or break it, go big or go home. Fox is heavily investing in this film to launch a number of spin-offs and sequels. This film is certainly ambitious: it's trying to fix all the continuity errors off the previous films, trying to bring back fans, and trying to make a bigger box office than the previous movies. Does it suceed?\r Online, some have commented that the rights to the X-Men should go back to Marvel. After X-Men 3: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine, many have lost faith in the franchise and the box office hasn't really improved, unfortunately. However, this movie redeems everyone and everything involved.\r The director, Bryan Singer, manages to balance pretty well two large super-powered casts of mutants from two different time periods. Most of the characters get their moments and their share of screen time. Sure, characters like Rogue, Kitty Pryde, Iceman, Bishop, Colossus, Quicksilver, Blink, Sunspot, Storm, Warpath, Havok, Toad and Ink (those last two names and their characters are funny) don't get more than a few lines, have only a few minutes of screen time, and often have to share the spotlight. However, they each have a purpose, however minimal it may be. Quicksilver is a great, funny, and entertaining character. His one action sequence was awesome, and I can't wait to see him return in X-Men Apocalypse. (Looks like DC's Flash and Disney's MCU Quicksilver have some competition!)\r Some of these--admittedly underused--characters have scenes that reportedly will be on the DVD version, others have signed multiple-picture deals or will appear in later movies. So this won't be the last we'll see of them.\r Some say Wolverine is in the X-Men movies too much. But the thing is he is the most recognizable, familiar, well-known, and arguably liked mutant of all the X-Men. In this movie, he isn't really the protagonist. Sure, he's the one that goes back in time. But here he gives the reins to a younger Charles Xavier, Magneto, and Mystique. In DOFP, Wolverine is more wiser, a mentor to his own mentor from the past. James McAvoy does a great job of making Professor X more relatable as a person. In the original trilogy, he was a bit unreachable. He was always the one with the answers and the steady hands. Here, he has lost almost everything and is at a low point in his life. That makes him a more relatable character. Magneto is as menacing and misguided as always, and Michael Fassbender does a great job. J.Law as Mystique--I honestly feel she needed a bit more emotion. No offense Jennifer Lawrence. (Maybe playing Katniss Everdeen too much has affected her? Mostly though she did fine.)\r Bolivar Trask is a morally grey character. He isn't a cardboard cutout villain, he's doing what he believes is necessary. He's a nice antagonist, and Peter Dinklage proves that height and size don't really matter when playing a role. Acting does. The Sentinels--I have mixed feelings about them. I guess the design could've been better. They weren't horrible in my opinion, but they weren't really good either. They were OK.\r The plot is a complex one. Not really confusing, just complex. It's a story of misunderstandings, hatred, and vengeance. But it's also one of forgiveness, team-work, and hope against seemingly insurmountable odds. It isn't your average superhero movie story.\r In my honest opinion, this is as good a team-up as The Avengers, if not better. The entire cast is great. The story is compelling and engaging. The CGI and special effects were great, even better than those displayed in the initial trailers and TV spots. I hope this does financially well,  because 20th Century Fox and the X-Men deserve a  break! I cannot wait for X-Men Apocalypse!",

Days of Future Past is very different and does not have time for subtlety, as soon as the movie kicks off you are shown an incredibly dystopian future where mutants and the humans who dared to help them are herded up and executed by the dozen and the X-Men themselves have been reduced to nothing more that freedom fighters with no real hope of survival. It\u2019s very dark and some of the scenes look like something that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in Terminator Franchise, it\u2019s certainly not something you would expect from the X-Men.\r With the fact that they are fighting a force that they have no hope of possibly defeating they decide that the only option is to send someone\u2019s consciousness back in time to the 70\u2032s to stop the Sentinel program from ever being created, the only one who would survive such a journey is Wolverine so that\u2019s exactly what happens. The plot of DOFP is set just over 10 years after the events of First Class. The Vietnam war is in full effect but drawing to a close, Magneto is locked away in a bunker for a pretty serious crime, and Charles Xavier has become a recluse and hides away in his mansion with Hank McCoy. Xavier is now a broken man and it\u2019s a real testament to James McAvoy\u2019s acting that you feel his pain and even though you know that he needs to man up and get on with it you understand why he feels that he can\u2019t.\r The mutant roster is largely based around the mutants we already know from the previous movies in the series but there are some new ones thrown into the mix as well. Most of the new additions are from the future (present?) and the scenes of them fighting off the Sentinels are some of the best action scenes of the entire series in terms of scope as you get to see them all using their powers as a team to try and prolong their lives a little while longer, these scenes are badass, there is no other work to suitably describe them. The only new mutant that we are really introduced to in the past is Quicksilver (played by Evan Peters), he is single-handed responsible for one of the highlights of humour through the entire movie. His mutation is that he can move at super-speeds and normally, you would just see him running as a blur but there is one particular scene where you get to see everything at his pace and it is pure genius!\r Thankfully the writers seem to have listened to the feedback of X-Men fans and they have looked at the issues that were lingering in the series and they have addressed almost every single one of them! This is something I was not expecting to see and it is something I am very grateful for indeed. The time-travelling aspect of the movie kind of renders most of what has happened in X-Men 1, 2, and 3 kind of obsolete and it is left somewhat unclear as to what has or hasn\u2019t happened in the current time-line. This isn\u2019t a bad thing at all and if anything it sets up a nice blank canvas for the next movie.\r Verdict:\r Days of Future Past is, hands down, the best movie in the X-Men series to date. Including both the cast of the original movies and First Class was of course risky because it means there is a lot of different people to keep track of, both familiar and new. This decision is definitely one that has paid off as you are left with a movie that has a story to tell and tell it well is does!! Also seeing both the old and new Xavier face-to-face is definitely something special.\r P.S. Make sure you stay until the very end of the credits!",

However it has been surpassed by the Avengers, both in their stand alone films and the juggernaut that was Avengers Assemble. Then Matthew Vaughn's prequel, X-Men: First Class (2011) shot some much needed life back into the series and things started to look up. But could the franchise keep it up?\r Now Bryan Singer, director of the first two mutant films, is back and has the mammoth task of combining both sets of actors and giving us a film more credible and entertaining than the dismal X-Men: Last Stand (2006).\r Without giving too much away, the plot revolves around Magneto and Professor X (McKellen and Stewart) sending Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to 1973 to see... Magneto and Professor X (Fassbender and McAvoy).  Their mission is to change history and prevent the war that will wipe out mutant kind. And thus we go from old cast to new.\r James McAvoy plays a broken Charles Xavier with raw anger and sadness, far removed from the all-knowing calm figure of Stewart. He is a joy to watch as he struggles with his power.\r Fassbender is also a wonder, never overplaying a role that could have led to scenery chewing of the highest order. The chemistry between both actors is amazing, I just wish they had more time together.\r Jennifer Lawrence has made the role of Mystique/Raven her own (Rebecca who??) She is sexy, sassy and focused but has not yet grown into her evil persona of the original films, which means we can truly love her (for now anyway).\r And onto Jackman. You just have to look at the posters to see he is supposed to be the star of the film and there is no denying that he has been consistently good even as the films diminished in quality. While he does play an important role in the plot, he sometimes acts as merely a foil for the new cast but what a foil he is.\r Special mention goes to Nicholas Hoult's Beast who has grown as a character even if his screen time isn't extensive.\r I couldn't write a review without mentioning Quicksilver. I admit that when I first read about the character being included I was sceptical. I truly believed that Singer only did it to piss off Whedon and the folks at the new Avengers film. But Evan Peters is a blast as the super speedy mutant who, despite his limited screen time, makes every scene he's in his own. His performance is an obvious contrast to the serious portrayal that Aaron Taylor Johnson will probably give in Age of Ultron (if the mid-credit scene in Captain America: The Winter Soldier is anything to go by). Also, there is a cheeky little nod to his parentage; brought a smile to my face.\r The film itself is well paced... action and emotion in equal balance. The 131 minute run time passes by without feeling like it is starting to lag.\r The mixture of high quality digital and grainy 1970s film is used to great effect.\r As with most Marvel films, stay until the end of the credits for a peak into what lies ahead for X-Men.\r There are a few niggles I have (at the beginning of the film Wolverine's claws are back to being made from adamantium which pretty much negates anything that happened in The Wolverine) but for the most part Singer brings back the familiar and fans can feel safe in his capable hands.",

This movie will not disappoint people who loves suspense, a great story line, and to have a whole lot of fun and enjoyment. Bryan Singer has done an amazing work in directing again, combining the action, the story, and the mix of emotions very effectively.\r For people criticizing the elements of the film such as not having enough action, no recap or story-telling of past events, and some characters such as wolverine not having enough \"importance\" in the story, you need to consider trying to change your perspective and how you look at the movie. Singer has tried to go back to comic style story telling. No recap of the origin and past events, unless the audience have watched the previous movies. Although, the movie is still greatly enjoyable and the stories can still be put together even though previous parts haven't been watched. That makes X-Men: Days of Future past have great originality and has been a great fluid addition to the story. The story also adds great originality. This has been the first X-Men movie in the series to add the element of time travel.\r The acting is very well polished and greatly executed by excellent actors such as Jennifer Lawrence, Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen. Since the story is focused on going back in time, the movie will be focused more on the \"past\" selves of the characters. Everyone has an important role in this movie. If someone was missing, it won't probably be this good.\r The amount of \"fighting\" that occurs can't really tell if a movie will be good. The focus of this movie is to stop a scientist from being killed, and a whole lot of suspense has been used to make the audience wonder of what the heroes would do, and what choices they would make. Singer focuses more on the story than the action in this movie.\r Overall, X-Men: Days of Future Past has been a great addition to the series and every element of this movie has been greatly polished.

X-Men: Days of Future Past presents audiences with one of the best comic book films ever made. From the stunning soundtrack, to the brilliant character development all round, to the masterfully conducted action sequences, Days of Future Past acts as the best X-Men film yet. The interplay between the characters, particularly between James McAvoy's Professor X and Michael Fassbender's Magneto, is gripping throughout. Whilst the stakes are risen, the film never falls into the trap that many comic book films nowadays fall into, that is that the whole world is under immediate threat. Rather, Singer creates a story that hits individuals on a personal level, creating one of the best films of 2014.",

There are action scenes but many are suffused with a sense of futility. Battles turn into massacres with the \"good guys\" on the wrong side of the carnage. A whiff of the apocalypse hangs in the air, ready to descend and blot out everything. Not since The Dark Knight Rises has a movie featuring familiar heroic figures taken such a grim and unconventional path. To reboot the X-Men franchise, director Bryan Singer, who first gave these characters screen life fourteen years ago, has crafted a continuity-lover's nightmare.\r X-Men: Days of Future Past is more science fiction than comic book action. The Terminator influences are immediately obvious, as are those of the Doctor Who adventure, \"Genesis of the Daleks.\" Trapped in a war-ravaged 2023, the X-Men face annihilation by The Sentinels, creatures of war created for one purpose: terminating mutants and all those who aid or abet them. Earth has turned into a giant killing field. The X-Men, unable to defeat The Sentinels, place all their hopes in one last-ditch effort: send one of their own back in time to avert the creation of The Sentinels. The choice is Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and his greatest challenge proves not to be stopping twisted Sentinel creator Boliver Trask (Peter Dinklage) but getting the 1973 versions of Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) to work together to save the future. In the cross-hairs is blue-skinned shapeshifter Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), who must be prevented from killing Trask lest the future be set. For Xavier, that means convincing her not to commit the deed. For Magneto, it means eliminating her so she can't do it. For Logan, caught in the middle, the situation becomes increasingly desperate.\r It would be fair to characterize the storyline of X-Men: Days of Future Past as \"dense.\" It's not one of those plots that caters to intellectual laziness. Time travel stories, even those that play by an established set of rules, are always challenging. There are battles and action scenes aplenty but, with exception of a playful sequence featuring a lightning-fast mutant called Quicksilver (Evan Peters), most are steeped in a sense of desperation. There are no grand moments of heroic triumph and victory comes from something more existential than beating the crap out of a bad guy.\r There is no single readily identified villain. In 2023, The Sentinels wear the mantle but they are implacable terminators - machines without soul or conscience. In 1973, depending on the moment, one could see Trask, Magneto, Mystique, or even Xavier as the antagonist but all have legitimate reasons for their behavior. Trask seeks peace; Magneto fights for the salvation of his species; Mystique want vengeance against someone who slaughtered her friends; and Xavier desires freedom from pain.\r There's a message to be found in X-Men: Days of Future Past as well. Benjamin Franklin once said, \"Those who surrender freedom for security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one.\" The creation and acceptance of The Sentinels represents a desire to cede liberty for safety and it has tragic consequences. This isn't a unique message, especially in science fiction films (The Robocop remake most recently addressed this), but Singer does a good job conveying it without becoming preachy.\r If there's a weakness to be found in X-Men: Days of Future Past, it's in the special effects. There are times when the computer generated imagery becomes sloppy and artificial. This is evident in the scenes featuring RFK stadium and The White House. Those look like video game cut scenes rather than photorealistic images of real locations. In a lower budget, lower profile motion picture, this sort of thing might not be noticeable but it stands out in a film of this caliber.\r Singer, returning to the X-Men after a ten year absence (his last venture with them was 2003's X2), has been given the task of completing a reboot that was begun in X-Men: First Class. To do this, he has taken a page from J.J. Abrams' Star Trek handbook - use time travel and the concept of multiverses and have a familiar presence provide the linkage. In Star Trek, that was Leonard Nimoy's Spock Prime. In X-Men: Days of Future Past, it's Wolverine. As a bonus, we also get Patrick Stewart's Professor X and Ian McKellan's Magneto as well as a bunch of other familiar faces. For those who felt The Last Stand was a poor exit for many of these characters, X-Men: Days of Future Past should at least salve the wound in part.\r X-Men: Days of Future Past is the third superhero film in less than two months and, even though this one is demonstrably different than its predecessors, superhero fatigue could diminish its box office potential.",
