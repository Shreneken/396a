While Astrid, Snoutlout and the rest of the gang are challenging each other to dragon races (the island's new favorite contact sport), the now inseparable pair journey through the skies, charting unmapped territories and exploring new worlds. When one of their adventures leads to the discovery of a secret ice cave that is home to hundreds of new wild dragons and the mysterious Dragon Rider, the two friends find themselves at the center of a battle to protect the peace. Now, Hiccup and Toothless must unite to stand up for what they believe while recognizing that only together do they have the power to change the future of both men and dragons.\u2026 Expand",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "It\u2019s not about the world catching up to understand poor, lonesome Hiccup. It\u2019s about Hiccup catching up to the expectations of the world on his own.",
        "Gleeful and smart, funny and serious, this sequel surpasses the endearing original with gorgeous animation \u2014 a dragon Eden, a dragon scourge, an infinitude of dragons \u2014 and one stirring human encounter after another.",
        "Not only does this second movie match the charm, wit, animation skill and intelligent storytelling of the original, I think it even exceeds it.",
        "This is a sequel that has its own story to tell and that gets right down to it, and it expands on the ideas from the first film, but in a way that tells a thematically satisfying and complete story. In other words, this is how franchises are supposed to work.",
        "Fun, action-packed and dramatically deep, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a prime example of \"How to Make a Sequel.\"",
        "How to Train Your Dragon 2 is the rare sequel that improves upon its predecessor in nearly every single way imaginable.",
        "If necessity is the mother of invention, then DreamWorks\u2019 desire to extend the Dragon franchise has propelled the creative team in the most admirable of directions, resulting in what just may be the mother of all animated sequels.",
        "The plot doesn\u2019t matter in the slightest; young and old fans of the first movie will be lining up for the wit, for the inventiveness of the characters, for the breathtaking visuals \u2014 and just the sheer fun of it all.",
        "One of this year's true surprises, the superior animated sequel not only is infused with the same independent spirit and off-kilter aesthetic that enriched the original, it also deepens the first film's major themes.",
        "A riveting, moving and beautifully animated film.",
        "If anyone is concerned about the way women are presented on the big screen these days, just look at how an evolved male like Hiccup respectfully treats his girlfriend Astrid (America Ferrera) and the portrayal of Blanchett\u2019s Valka.",
        "It's thrilling, a soaring blend of 3D animation and spectacular storytelling that swerves daringly to honor the healing chaos of family, human and dragon.",
        "The movie offers just the right amount of spectacle.",
        "Looks, feels and flows like a real movie. It's better than the last few Pixar features, among other things, and from where I sit that includes \"Toy Story 3.\"",
        "Director Dean DeBlois has been saying this installment is the middle movie in a How to Train Your Dragon trilogy. It's clear that he took inspiration from the first Star Wars trilogy \u2014 not a bad model for breathing new life, and yes, a bit of fire, into one of Hollywood's more nuanced animated franchises.",
        "The dragons in this movie are expertly brought to life.",
        "How to Train Your Dragon 2 may not be Toy Story 2 (or The Empire Strikes Back, for that matter), but it\u2019s a more than worthy successor to the first film. Even when it falls short of its lofty ambitions, you can\u2019t help but appreciate how thoroughly it commits to achieving them.",
        "Like its curious and intrepid hero, Dragon keeps wandering off from blockbuster responsibilities to chase the fancies of its big, beating reptilian heart. The fantasy action has never been more exciting or visually impressive, but it repeatedly takes backseat to character relationships, which develop on several new intriguing fronts.",
        "How to Train Your Dragon 2 is how to make a sequel, when it gets its head out of the clouds.",
        "The voice work, by Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson, and America Ferrera, among others, is also lively and fun. This sequel also adds a major new character, Valka (voiced exquisitely by Cate Blanchett), a protective den mother who runs a dragon sanctuary. She gives the film a surprising emotional resonance.",
        "Dragon 2 feels like a proper film, not just a cartoon.",
        "To follow-up a successful film is a daring achievement in itself, but to surpass it is something else, and that\u2019s what DuBois does here.",
        "At times terrifying and too tough for tinies, this is nevertheless a triumphant sequel that puts its faith in Hiccup and Toothless to find a way through dark times for man and dragon. Until we all get our own dragon to go flying with, the result is a story sufficiently thrilling to have us all airborne.",
        "What DeBlois has deepened in No. 2, is the film's emotional core. Though there are moments when the tension goes slack, the cast steps up to keep things afloat.",
        "The rote hero/villain face-offs are exciting, but the film is in no hurry to fast-forward to them. DeBlois seems to have a real passion for this world, and like Hiccup, he seems much more interested in soaring through the clouds than in fighting on the ground.",
        "The look of the film is amazing. The animation, particularly when the dragons take flight, is seamless.",
        "I laughed, I cried, I longed for a pet dragon to call my own.",
        "Visually interesting but offers nothing groundbreaking. The animation is competent but not overwhelming. There's no moment of wonderment.",
        "Like its 2010 predecessor, it's one of the most gorgeous computer-animated kids' films you'll come across, and one of the few that uses 3-D smartly and effectively.",
        "It is by far the sharpest-looking DreamWorks Animation film to date.",
        "Thankfully, all of the voice actors from the original return, including Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill and Craig Ferguson, and keep lightening the mood.",
        "Offers some stunningly beautiful sequences and an engaging, if at times quite dark, story line.",
        "While the original movie benefited from narrative simplicity and an admirable lack of villains, this one paints the screen with too many characters and frequent diversions from the main story, but nevertheless serves up a bountiful and sugary feast for the 3-D-bespectacled eyes.",
        "Dragon 2 is at its best when it quiets down and dares to be intimate.",
        "Dragon 2 is considerably darker and more self-aware than its forerunner. Both films are speedier than the average animated blockbuster. In places, Dragon 2 is almost too fast to keep up with, and, in other places, it\u2019s a little too dark, at least in 3-D.",
        "The plot is needlessly busy, and much of the action is more manic and indistinct. But How to Train Your Dragon 2 cuts deeper than the first picture \u2014 it will be particularly resonant for anyone who has ever worked with or adopted rescue animals \u2014 and there are a few sequences of cartoon grandeur.",
        "Clearly, these films are the work of people who love animals. More importantly though, going beyond the pat eco-conscious message that every kids\u2019 film has to have, HTTYD2 touches on how complex the emotional bond between a person and an animal can be.",
        "There aren\u2019t just more dragons, but more characters, more plot, more everything. The trade-off is that the charm of the original gets a little lost, a casualty of rapid-franchise expansion.",
        "After meandering for a while, the story kicks into gear in the third act, with a couple of legitimately shocking and well-executed developments that do pack a punch missing elsewhere in the film.",
        "How to Train Your Dragon 2 recaptures those lyrical highs. But returning writer-director Dean DeBlois also aims to layer on more poignancy for Baruchel and his castmates to play. At points, we\u2019re left feeling a little detached.",
        "A cartoon with better animation and livelier action, if fewer jokes. If there\u2019s one thing these sweet-message/great flying sequence movies don\u2019t need is fewer jokes.",
        "Hats off to Dreamworks for offering some bold surprises in a respectable sequel filled with moments of humour and emotion among its ample noise and movement.",
        "Younger kids looking for the cute connection between hesitant teen Hiccup and his loyal dragon, Toothless, may be stunned by the film\u2019s violent tone. At the same time, it\u2019s the unflinching edge that gives the film its unexpected depth.",
        "This is a more rugged affair than, say, \"Frozen,\" and any admirers of that film might find themselves yearning for a few more songs and a little less testosterone.",
        "If there isn't enough to feel, at least there's a lot to look at. Thanks to the superb 3-D direction by DeBlois, we swoop through the air, whoosh down dragons\u2019 tails, and juuust baaaarely squeeze into small crevices, but still, those experiences are only like being on a really great rollercoaster \u2014 they don't mean anything.",
        "The action sequences here are armrest-gripping fun, and you only wish DeBlois and his animators had been even more confident; held their shots even longer; allowed us to enjoy the whistle of the wind and the curve of the dragons\u2019 flight paths without hurriedly cutting away to another angle, and another, and another. When the film flies, it soars.",
        "It has the core of a genuine crowd-pleaser, but unfortunately something bigger and more all-consuming keeps getting into its head.",
        "What's unfortunate is that Toothless is starring in a toothless story."

They are living peacefully withHiccup, the main character of the movie, lives in a small viking town called Berk. Thanks to his studies and constant analysis of dragons, people of Berk now a lot more about dragons and understand them better. They are living peacefully with tamed dragons until a group of dragon hunters arrive from a neighboring place. From then the story gets twisted and we unpredicted events unfold.\r Hiccup constantly pushes to solve the problems with conversation and dialog unlike most vikings in his town who are ready to fight and use violence. He relentlessly engages with the \u201cenemies\u201d and keeps a discourse with them. He constantly studies them and tries to understand them.\r There are two strong themes in the movie that made me love it. The first theme is the relation between humans and animals which symbolically represents the relation between any two group of adversaries: two races, two ethnicities, followers of two religions, or even two nations. Through the movie, when a group studies and understands the other group, animosities subside, mutual respect flourishes, and the common cores of both groups bind them together. In the call for understanding other groups, this movie implicitly asks us to throw away all the preconceptions and dogma and look at them, judge them, and treat them fairly and justly.\r The second strong theme in the movie is Hiccup's constant search for his identity. He is confused about who he really is and why he is different from all other vikings. But he also ceaselessly searches and seek what he wants to do with his life. He is fearless when he faces challenges and new experiences.\r How to train your dragon 2, is a phenomenal movie, the kind that you have wait years for to come and the kind that will fill you with joy whenever you remember. It is extremely fun to watch with an amazing story and unbelievable cinematography. It is a kids movie for adults. After watching this movie, all you want to do is flying and pondering on the questions that it touches.",

Typically, sequels to an animated movie end up being trash, but this film doesn't follow that trend. As a sequel, it has more dragons that are very interesting and cool looking. The action, graphics and overall story in the film are great as well! I'm very happy with the progress of the main characters, and it really sets up the 3rd film well. Where I was turned off, was the constant need to force Toothless into doing cute actions. In the first film, Toothless had a genuine cuteness to him, but in the sequel it was overdone and quite frankly became distracting. For example, there would be some important dialogue between characters, and then Toothless would be doing something in the background... I guess they put this is for the kiddies who could care less about what's going on in the story, but as an adult, I care about the characters and the challenges they're trying to overcome... but I couldn't focus on what they were saying with how distracting Toothless became during those scenes. Also, I really liked the rag-tag bunch of Hiccups friends in the first film. They were a ton of fun, but in the sequel, they didn't have the same impact. Astrid as Hiccups girlfriend is boring, and Snotlout, Fishlegs, Tuffnut were not really funny. Ruffnut was definitely the best of the group, but her \"joke\" quickly ran its course, when they used it over and over again. Other than the many distractions from Toothless and the lack of fun from Hiccup's group of friends, this movie was a fantastic sequel. I will recommend it to all families and feel like it's a great challenger to Lego Movie for best animated film of the year.",

It grows our characters from the first film and really feels like a continuation of the series and not just some cash grab. We see how Berk has changed and how the lives of everyone on the island has become better, I really love how the film tackles darker subject matter like remorse, forgiveness, and redemption, while at the same time touching on themes of love and loss. The screenplay is filled with moments of pure heart and we really see the bond between Hiccup and Toothless expanded upon. Not only is this a great screenplay, but also Dreamworks\u2019 best since the original \u201cShrek.\u201d\r The characters and voice actors are perfect. I love how the characters have grown and their personalities have been enhanced. Hiccup takes a more proactive role in this film and we really see that he\u2019s matured a lot from the first film. His and Toothless\u2019 relationship is expanded on and it really is still the core emotional center of the film. The side characters like Astrid and Snotlout get more screen time this time around and they actually do more with the film. They aid with the comic relief to keep the movie a little lighter than the extremely dark tone that it\u2019s going for. There are a few new characters introduced into the universe like Valka, Eret, and Drago Bludvist. Valka is a great character and she\u2019s another great female addition to the roster. She has a great emotional ark and not only that, she is a strong character and a better dragon master than Hiccup that really holds her own. Eret is a nice addition to the cast as he is also comic relief, but also a interest side villain character. Drago is a fantastic villain and is really a cold hearted murderer. His method of mastering dragons really differs from Hiccups and its a great contrast that shows the different types of people that are in this world. I love how they build him up before actually revealing him.\r The animation and visuals are probably amongst the best I\u2019ve seen from any CGI film to date. It is just breathtakingly gorgeous. The character\u2019s movements are so fluid and each character has their own way of moving. What I found really impressive is the facial animation. There are so many intimate moments in this film that require no dialogue and we can sense exactly what the characters are thinking from their expressions. There is always something happening in the foreground as well as the background and it\u2019s unlike anything that I\u2019ve seen before in the medium. Characters could be taking in front of the camera, but in the background there could be an epic battle taking place. There is a lot to take in, but the director, Dean DeBlois, knows how to balance the visuals with well paced story. The layout and environment are also quite impressive. Every blade of grass, powder of snow, and water particles are just amazing to look at.\r The score from John Powell impresses again and really enhances the already great score of the series. It\u2019s bombastic, epic, touching, and moving. There is something about the score that really makes the film so much better than it already is. I was literally left in tears because of the score and how beautiful it is.\r I\u2019m gonna come out and say it. \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon 2\u201d is a MASTERPIECE amongst modern films and a revolution in animation. It is a film that is going to push animation further and allow the medium to be taken more seriously. For a major studio production, it goes to places that the medium has only thought of, but couldn\u2019t really pull it off because of limitations set by studios and audiences alike. It is almost a near perfect film and I award it the highest 5/5 that I can.",

Then comes a villain who wants to enslave them all. The plot and dialogue are pretty mundane, the characters lack any spark or originality, but the animation is lovely. There's too much dialogue for young audiences, but enough action sprinkled throughout to entertain. Overall, an uninspired and unspecial followup.

But when someone wants to control all the dragons, it's up to Hiccup and the gangStory:\rFive years after the Viking village of Berk has made peace with the dragons, dragons now live amongst the villagers as working animals and companions. But when someone wants to control all the dragons, it's up to Hiccup and the gang to stop him. The film has been getting a TON of praise from critics, so much that I decided to finally begin reviewing animated films (Will eventually go to other genres). Whereas the 1st film's story revolved around Hiccup as he tries to earn the respect of his father and fellow villagers, along with developing a relationship with Toothless, the 2nd film focuses on Hiccup's family and the dangers that Drago Bludvist has on the dragons. To me, I don't see what the critics are talking about when it comes to the story being refreshing and original since it does have some problems. The story here is by-the-books: (To avoid as much spoilers as possible, I won't reveal anything important) Hiccup learns about Drago, Drago does evil things, Hiccup meets Drago and tries to solve the problem without violence, Drago does more evil things, Hiccup has to stop Drago in the end leading into a final action scene. The story here is nothing new and amazing as critics seem to say, and since this is one of those animated films that centers around its story and characters (as in their contributions to the plot) while also having a serious tone, having a cliched story actually hurts the film more than it would in something like Madagascar or Rio. In fact, the story in the 1st film to me felt better than here mostly because of Hiccup's great chemistry with some of the characters. Overall, the story is receiving more praise than it deserves. 6/10\r Animation:\rThis is the film's biggest strength as the animation here is spectacular. The backgrounds look stunning, the textures are great, the character designs are well made, the environments vary from snowy mountains, to lush flora, to ice-y terrain, and Berk. Another impressive thing was the variety of dragons. There were at least 30 different kinds of dragons seen, and each one looks like they have their own unique feature that makes them special. You can easily make an encyclopedia on all the dragons here. But the most incredible thing about the animation were the action scenes, especially with some \"Alpha\" dragons fighting in the background. Definitely watch this movie in 3D or IMAX if you can. 10/10\r Characters and Comedy:\rAs said, to me the 1st film made better use of the characters than here. I'll say that Hiccup's relationship with his father Stoick and his mother Valka make for some of the more heartwarming moments in the film. Dreamworks did add in some emotional scenes here as things happen to Hiccup, and it's great to see him change throughout the film because of those actions. His bond with Toothless also serves as another highlight to the film. His scenes with his family and Toothless are some of the best moments in the film. As for all the returning characters, they don't serve much of a purpose in the film outside of mere comic relief. I'm even disappointed that Dreamworks didn't expand Astrid and Hiccup's relationship seeing as how they're a couple now. Astrid just follows what all the side characters do now. As for the villain, Drago is your standard-dark dressing, eye-slashed, gritty-voiced villain who doesn't have an interesting backstory or goal. He wants to control all the dragons. So original. As for comedy, the returning side characters are mostly comic relief, so with them and Toothless, you'll find some nice comedy sprinkled here and there amidst all the action and conflicts. It's clear that Dreamworks focused more on Hiccup, his family, and Toothless more than their returning characters and villain. 7/10\r Sound:\rJohn Powell does an incredible job with this score incorporating a more \"epic\" fantasy feel to the film. The score ends up immersing you into this fictional world that Dreamworks created. They even added a song to the mix. It features Hiccup's mom and dad singing a song they hold dear to them, and it's a nice addition to an already incredible score. Oh, and the sound effects here are fine, especially in the action scenes. 10/10\r Acting and Casting:\rAll the performances here are great but if there's one thing I have to complain about, it would be Jay Baruchel's voice for Hiccup. Watch the movie and find out why. I also feel they didn't use Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse to their full potential. But the acting is still great and the casting is fine. 8/10\r Verdict:\rThis film although great, is sort of overrated when it comes to praise. This is mostly because of the flaws in the story and some of the characters. But the animation and score are what makes this film soar over Frozen and The Lego Movie. This is my pick for best animated feature of the year.....for now.\r Extra:\r+1 for being a sequel I enjoyed.\r Rating: 9/10",

This looks like a live action movie\". but aside from the incredible animation, deep down this movie's something even more. it takes the characters we all loved in the first one to the next level, just like a good sequel should do. ya know in the first movie, Hiccup was the boy, the boy who found a dragon. in HTTYD 2, he has to become the man, the chief of Berk. this reminded of \"The Lion King\" or \"The Empire Strikes Back\". i walked outta the movie like \"This is probably \"The Lion King\" or \"The Empire Strikes Back\" of this generation\". the action's exciting, the comedy's hilarious and it has fantastic emotions. i actually cried like 3 times in \"How To Train Your Dragon 2\". this movie's not just for kids, it's also for adults. i mean, adults are gonna love this movie, cause there are themes that really hit them, and kids are gonna love the movie cause it's a fun and exciting action/fantasy movie with incredible animation and awesome dragons. and when they grow up, they'll start to understand the darker themes and emotional aspects the movie was going for, and they'll appreciate it even more. that's what i call a good sequel! another one of the great highlights in the movie, it's the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless. to Hiccup, Toothless's a lot more than just a pet dragon. he's Hiccup's best friend and they really show how complex the emotional bond between a person and an animal can really be. it was perfect in that sense. the only small gripe i got with the movie, it's that Drago could've been a little better as the villain. don't get me wrong, he's still a great new character and the movie does make him better as it goes. it's just that, when he first showed up, i was like \"This guy feels kinda weak\". that's just a small gripe, it's not enough to bring the movie down. honestly, i can't think of anything bad in \"How To Train Your Dragon 2\". it's the best animated sequel from DreamWorks we have, since \"Kung Fu Panda 2\". Dean DeBlois, i really hope you win the Oscar for this movie. you definitely deserve it! you gave us one of the best sequels in a really long time. i'm telling ya, Dean DeBlois knows what he's doing in every movie he makes. he gave us \"How To Train Your Dragon 1\" which was amazing. now, he gives us \"How To Train Your Dragon 2\" which is even better. i'm really excited for \"How To Train Your Dragon 3\", but i don't know how they're gonna top this one. this is the BEST animated movie of the year, and probably one of the best animated movies in a really long time. so, if you haven't seen it yet, go watch it. i swear to you, you're gonna love it.\r 10/10",

It has many amazing shots and touching pieces of dialog, but it has just as many polar opposite moments. If I had to sum up my thoughts on this movie in one word, it would be disjointed. There are many amazing scenes in this movie, when Hiccups father is reunited with his wife it is truly touching and extremely emotional. But the surprisingly plentiful scenes of the girl twin swooning over arin son arit son of arene son of Arathorn, is strait up stupid, its totally disconnected from the tone of the rest of the movie and was clearly thrown in there because every family movie needs to have comic relief characters. Ugh, actually the friends in general, aside from Astrid, are painfully stupid to watch. They don\u2019t add to the story and they do not need to exist, why are they even such main characters in this movie? You could have had just Hiccup, Astrid, Stoic, and hiccups mom be the main characters, it\u2019s really baffling. And while you\u2019re at it, add Gobber to the list. He is probably the worst offender aside from the twin girl. When he interrupts the scene where Stoic and Hiccups mom are singing to each other just pulls me out of the scene every time. He completely breaks up the scene and it feels completely separate from what we are experiencing. In the first movie he was the kids mentor and he taught them and the audience about dragons, but here\u2026 he\u2019s just pointless! Except for creating laughs for the kiddies to giggle at, and that\u2019s not a character. I don\u2019t care about Gobber when him and Stoic are going after Hiccup, I care about STOIC! Gobber is one dimensional and not funny\u2026 to me anyways. *sighs* and all of these points can be put towards the twin girl and the rest of the friends as well. Its funny they actually have a resolution for the two guys trying to impress the twin girl, like what the heck? Why should I care about that? Short answer, I don\u2019t. Its jarring compared to what\u2019s actually happening and it just pulls me out of the movie and leaves me wishing they were just eradicated from the whole movie. And if they did that, then it woulda been like 20 minutes shorter!\rBut other than that, I really do like this movie. While I do have more negative reactions inside when I here this movies name, I do like quite a lot in this movie. Like the animation, its stunning. Anything to do with water, ice, or hair looks photo realistic. Its insane. The character models have gotten a MUCH needed upgrade. Hiccup ACTUALLY looks like a freaking human! But I do think that because they used motion capture, the people do seem a little jerky\u2026 particularly in the first act. But its not really a problem, just an observation.\rThe relationship between Stoic and the mom is really heart wrenching. I do feel like these two are in love I believe their story, and it really is heart breaking when Stoic dies, while I don\u2019t think Hiccups reaction is handled very well at all, I do feel for him and when they send him to\u2026 val hallah? Right? Right. The relationship between Hiccup and Toothless is really the anchor for the whole thing. You really get the idea that these two have been best friends for a while and they have gotten really good at working together. However I do have a problem with toothless, and the portrayal of dragons in general.\rI think they went a little over board with the intelligence of dragons and they make them borderline human. In the first movie, Toothless was intelligent, he had coherent thoughts and a distinct personality. But he was still an animal, it never felt like he was just as smart as his human companion. In Dragon 2, he is borderline human. And it is really disjointed from the first movie. Now, the designs of the new dragons are far, FAR better than the first one. They look truly awesome. One\rlast thing about the dragons, is anyone else perplexed at why night furies would evolve to have their back spikes be split in two, without them knowing? Like toothless almost lost hiccup twice because he couldn\u2019t fly alone, but he had this hidden feature that his species hid from themselves? What\u2019s the evolutionary advantage? Why would toothless not know about this super useful ability that is a part of his physiology? It makes zero sense, but that\u2019s really just a nitpick and doesn\u2019t affect the overall story.\rOverall, How to Train Your Dragon is a mixture of downright amazing, and painfully silly. It\u2019s deep and emotional, and stupid and silly. I have quite a few problems with it, but all in all it is a great time.\rHtTYD2 gets a 6/10, stunningly beautiful, yet painfully silly.",

That was disappointing.  They did introduce another major female character, but she was nowhere near the inspiration that Astrid had been.

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nFive years have passed since the events of the first movie and we're already thrown into how much Berk has changed since then and how much more of a community it feels with the presence of dragons. Things such as Dragon Racing at Berk are fun to watch and it's nice to see all the different ways in which dragons have come to use and how everyone has become adapted to being around them. Hiccup's new inventions were very cool; kudos to the filmmakers for coming up with those very nifty ideas.\r One of the things that struck me at first was how beautiful the film looked; the visuals and animation were vastly improved on the first and characters, dragons and scenery looked and felt more alive than ever. There's a lot of attention to detail such as small character quirks and Toothless playing about in the background with other dragons. That being said though, having dragons pop in and out of frame in the background is overdone by just a touch and distracts from important dialogue and events occurring in the foreground.\r The introduction of Hiccup's mother in the movie feels a little too rushed; I thought that maybe she would have been brought in in the third film. Furthermore, the little mention of Hiccup's mother earlier on in the film takes away from the surprise of the reveal. However, it's nice to see the two finally get to bond, Hiccup discovering that he takes a lot from his mother, and the reunion with the whole family, when Stoick stumbles across his wife, is very heartwarming indeed. \"You're as beautiful as the day I lost you.\" - this may or may not have brought a tear to my eye...\r The moment when the film begins to lose its balance, and almost ejects you from the immersion is when Drago Bludvist, the antagonist, is given very little build-up, despite the mystery surrounding the character at the beginning of the story, and is suddenly seen launching an attack on the dragon home inhabited by Valka, Hiccup's mother. The remainder of the film at this point feels rushed, as if the filmmakers realised they'd forgotten about the threat they'd introduced at the start of the film. I wasn't entirely convinced that Drago was a menacing villain, despite his plans and actions in the film, and the filmmakers hit a bit of a sour note on making the antagonist black, something a little clich\u00e9 in animated films and just a little bit racist too.\r The battle at this point in the movie feels a little too reminiscent of the final battle in the first installment, making it hard not to draw comparisons between the two. Stoick's death was emotional but I expected a greater reaction from everyone else, especially Hiccup and Valka as they'd just lost the chance of being reunited as a family. Having Stoick killed off and Valka there to 'take his place' as a parent for Hiccup just seemed a little too convenient.\r I felt a little disappointed with the climax and ending; though it regarded more the connection between Toothless and Hiccup, the final battle at Berk was a little too short for my liking. Other than Hiccup becoming chieftain and taking his father's mantle, the ending just makes it feel like not much had happened, that there wasn't much of a lesson to learn and that there was little difference between the beginning and end events of the film.\r Though I don't mind the emphasis put on the relationship between Hiccup, his mother and his father, I feel that other characters weren't developed enough and that some of them were merely there for comic relief. The changes made to Astrid felt a little off; yes, you can tell that it's meant to be the same Astrid from the first film and yes, five years have passed but the character's appearance and characterisation is softened and a little watered down from the strong character that she was in the predecessor. It felt like she was only there to be the established 'love interest' who we don't really get to learn much more about. Eret, the dragon trapper and a new character to the series, was one of the only other characters who had sufficient development and subsequently had believable motivations.\r How To Train Your Dragon 2 is a good film and is worth the watch, carrying a lot of heart and is guaranteed to make you smile, laugh and maybe even break into tears but the sequel loses its footing with a story that rushes itself in its second half and fails to develop characters as it did with its predecessor.",

SoI loved the first movie, so I was excited to see what they could do with a sequel (especially when Dreamworks has been so well w/ sequels, with the 2nd Kung Fu Panda movie and the 3rd Madagascar being the best in their respective series). So I went to see this movie with a few friends, and none of us liked it. And personally, I normally like movies that everyone else hates, not the other way around- well, with the exception of maybe Frozen, but  many people, I see now, agree with me that it wasn't that good.\r I mean, personally I though the pacing was awful (which was  also a problem I had w/ Frozen) - I thought the mother's reveal, the villain's reveal, and even the central conflict were shown to quickly. And the villain was the worst I've seen since, well, Hans from Frozen. Actually, this was probably worse because he looked so evil and mad, but also a genius, and he looked that way, but his dialogue was very bland and kind of stupid, and his intentions were stupid and overused (seriously? Why did they have to add the world-domination part?!) and he just didn't seem...evil enough. And I really didn't like Hiccup's mom. I guess there was something about her personality that I didn't like, but I didn't like her inclusion in the movie. Her being dead in the first movie created tragedy for Hiccup and Stoik (since Hiccup had noone to support him when his dad looked down upon him, and Stoik was a single parent trying to take care of his people, but also be a good father), and gave Stoik a good reason for hating dragons. And the fact that she wanted peace between dragons and humans made it kind of Hiccup's 'destiny' to be like that, which takes away from the first movie, where HE was the first viking who wouldn't kill a dragon. Now, if it turned out that she was taken away and, over time grew to love dragons, that would be a different thing.\rThen there was the handsome british guy. His character could have been pretty good- a guy who was on the bad side but turned good? That's what made Prince Zuko such an awesome character! But he changed sides a bit too fast (going back to the pacing)- maybe if they Riders saved him, but he betrayed them, but after thinking about what is good and what isn't, then he changed his mind, that would have made me like his character more (and then, when Hiccup gave him a-certain-person's dragon, he would have earned that honor a bit more). But his character also caused for some wanna-be-funny moments from Ruffnut...I know they're teens, so jokes about a girl liking a hot guy a are pretty much inevitable, but noone in the theater I went to laughed at the scenes where she's pretty much drooling for the guy (well, maybe except for when she falls in love w/ Snottlout and Fishlegs).\r There were also a few little things that pissed me off, like Hiccup being shown as adventurous at the beginning, but everyone forgets about that. And when we found out about Stoik wanting to make Hiccup chief, it's through this odd...fake conversation between Astrid and Hiccup, which could have been cute if it wasn't for Astrid using her hands like Hiccup does and him asking when he's ever done that- jokes like that almost always feel forced imo. In fact, a lot of the jokes in this movie feel forced. And I thought the scene where Stoik and Hiccup's mom were singing could have been quite emotional, it was pretty awkward (especially w/ Gobber talking in the middle). And I'll probably be the first to say it, but I think Dragon Racing is really not fun to watch- it's like they wanted to make a cool-looking sport like Quidditch, but to make it with the least effort possible- by both creativity of the writers, and the skill required by the players.\r Even though I didn't like the movie, I did think there were some good points about it: I thought Toothless, especially w/ his interactions w/ other dragons, was pretty cute and funny, but he was also a total badass in fights, and hi struggling to not follow the Alpha Dragon was pretty awesome. In fact, all the battles were awesome (though not as much as in the first movie), and while the shots of the flying got old from the first movie, they still look beautiful- especially in 3D. And (spoiler alert) Stoik's death scene was pretty heartbreaking, especially knowing that he had been trying so hard to be good and had wanted to see his son become chief and just wanted to come home as a happy family- I swear, his death almost made me cry as much as Mufasa's, not to mention it was done by Toothless (though he was under control by the villain, which is btw the only moment when I really thought that he was an evil madman). Of course, his death was ruined when the scene right after his death, there was a scene where everyone is being goofy while struggling to fly on the baby dragons, but it was still quite a heart tugging moment while it lasted.",

The gaping tundra of Winter is beyond us, and for that I say we are officially in the midst of the summer movie going season. Sequels, sequels, and more sequels are filling the gaps every weekend, 16 to be exact.\rSooner or later, goodwill from post franchises are going to run out. This is not the case with the returning favorites of the beloved \"How To Train Your Dragon\". \"Dragon\" was a film nobody, not even myself, suspected of being the next best thing..but it was. A little film from Dreamworks Animation, that distinctly gave Pixar a run for their money. The animation was gorgeous, the story even more so. A voice cast that included Gerard Butler, Jay Baruchel, Craig Ferguson and Jonah Hill. One could perhaps argue that something is \"missing\" from this sequel, I would argue not.\r \"How To Train Your Dragon 2\" stands on its own, not as a sequel, but as an endearing story of hope, forgiveness, and courage. Our favorite characters are back in full swing. Taking place five years after the events in the first film. Hiccup (Baruchel) and his cohorts are all young adults now, serving as dragon riders in Berk. Who now are living peacefully among the towns people. The curiosity of Hiccup has grown immensely, and the world he thought he knew has opened up wider than he could ever imagine. Dealing with the added stress of being appointed his righteous father, Stoick (Gerard Butler) successor, and his tough as nails girlfriend Astrid (America Ferrera). Hiccup's curiosity eventually gets him caught by a notorious dragon warrior, which eventually turns out to be his long lost mother Valka (Cate Blanchett). Hiccup then discovers the plans of an imminent attack by the ruthless Drago Bludvist, a dragon hunter who will stop at nothing until his army is complete.\r Furthermore, the main success here lies within the brilliant character development. I recently saw in an article by Entertainment Weekly in which they compared the characters, I saw a sluggish standing, dependent Hiccup being compared to a 20 year old, one legged and tough Hiccup, and to be honest I couldn't be more happier. As with time, it evidently changes everyone. While sure Hiccup and his friends are \"growing facial hair\", riding on the backs of dragons like it's nothing. Hiccup has become more than a sensational character to root for, rather a Luke Skywalker for this younger generation. We also can't have this film if not for the loveable mascot and poster child; Toothless. The silly, charming and fun Night Fury dragon, that stole our hearts back in 2008.\r Equally, the story is just as good, if not better, than the original. The first one had the added pressure of society accepting dragons. Now they have but, face a greater threat than before. In the form of Drago Bludvist, who's rip-roaring voice is brought to spectacular life by Djimon Hounsou. For a childrens film; his antics are a bit darker than most villains you would see. Younger children may be frightened by his overall appearance. However, from my standpoint, I felt he was a worthy adversary for our crew of heroes. A Darth Vader to Hiccup's Skywalker. I also enjoyed the new character Erin (voiced by Game Of Thrones own Kit Harrington).\r Of course, some will likely attest that the film's characters are a bit too harsh, or deafening. Some storybook concepts will likely have to be explained to some youngsters. There is an emotional integrity to be upheld here, and director Dean DeBois keeps that formula that made it's predecessor all the more credible. Including characters we care more about, then we have had before. I found little squabbles here and there of certain action set pieces that perhaps felt out of place. If speaking figuratively it never once took away from my fulfillment and satisfaction.\r Most sequels tend to overdo it, others just wreck it's potential franchise. The old saying as it goes \"if it ain't broken, don't fix it\". \"How To Train Your Dragon 2\" is an emotionally charged, and high flying adventure. The animation is breathtaking, and better than it has every been. I find it hard looking at this film as a sequel, partially because it's so well done that it stands on its own. Which in any sequel is rare. I can only imagine what the future has in store for our lovable band of characters. I do know one thing, \"How To Train Your Dragon 2\" falls in that 5 percent of sequels that actually builds on their predecessor.\r A\r By: Nate Adams\r Directed By: Dean DeBois\rRated: PG\rRuntime: 108 mins\rStudio: Dreamworks Animation (Fox)\rRelease Date: June 13th 2014\r Thanks for Stopping By \u00ae",

Real character growth takes place and emotion is found throughout, although the characters in the film seem oblivious to this. When something devastating happens they only stay sad for a little bit before moving back on to the optimism and humor. It kind of sucked me out of the experience as I was still reeling from what just happened. You think they would have just taken a little bit more time to mourn.\r The conflict at hand is very well done. A great villain sets things in motion, however the battles against him seem to lack a sense of urgency. Key powerful and emotional moments pop up in these battles, but they are gone in an instant.\r It seems odd to criticize a kid-oriented family movie for lacking some emotional depth. However it's just not hard to notice it's missing. Despite that though the film hardly suffers from it at all. It's still an excellent adventure and one that is sure to please. It just didn't hit every note in the same near-flawless ways the first one did. My total score for the movie is a 7.8/10.",

And not only it did not disappoint...but I can almost say that this was the best sequel I've ever seen, since probably Kung Fu Panda 2.\r What works in this movie is probably how the story is actually set 5 years in the future: our characters have grown up and that's already a very nice touch to the story, especially since they are also different in their behaviours, especially Hiccup being a very more reliable character and unlike the first movie, where he was more of a \"passive\" character, he's now always in the battle and you do feel such high respect on seeing his sense of exploration and of knowledge. The music is fantastic, the story is interesting and follows extremely well the first movie almost naturally, and all the characters are so likeable that it's hard to pick a favourite one (SPOILER: heck, my sister cried when Stoick died nearly the end of the movie: I was not expecting that to happen and all in the theatre actually cried when that happened: It's rare when a movie makes everyone cry like that)) and It's just a pleasent movie to watch and watch again.\r However if I have to pick a BIG flaw of the movie, that would definitely be the Villain.\r I have absolutely no idea who the bad guy was: we see a scene in the past where he tried to submit the village chiefs, and then we move in the future (the movie's present) where  he's just bad and controls dragons. That's. It.\rSure, we know -a- reason why he hates dragons, but he has absolutely no character growth and we basically get nothing out of him: he came as he went, and when he dies it's as if nothing happened. That was a huge flaw because it had everything except a well made villain (On this regard, I heard that in the beginning that the main villain was going to be Hiccup's mother, and as much as that idea is a lot more darker than the movie really is, I think it would have worked MUCH better than putting in a random bad guy with basically no character development).\r Aside that big flaw, nothing else really ruins it: I honestly didn't expect this movie to be as good as the original, but I'm almost sure that it's even better! Opinions may vary, but I'm definitely gonna watch this movie again, once it comes out in dvd.\r Alongside Kung Fu Panda 2!",

The movie was good, but there's one part where the movie kinda lost me, Stoick's death. One of my favorite characters got killed off. And after reuniting with his long lost wife, it defanitely made me shed a tear. There's a lot of new dragons, all cool and unique in their own ways, but there's so many new ones I couldn't keep track of them all.

The host, Neil Patrick also said the same thing during the 2015 Oscars. But in the digital world, slight change in the title makes random in order. I mean on the computer and web world, it won't show in order. Even sometime it might get lost in a vast number of other titles if they dare to chance the first word in the title for a sequel. Other than that they are not stupid as many people think. That's why they highlighted 'Dragon' boldly than the rest of the words.\r This part two was not much different to its first. The story continues five years after Hiccup recovers from his injury. He and his pet, Toothless discovers a new land during the survey for the map. So their's adventure begins, but end in a trouble and forces all his people from the town to involve and fight against the rising evil force that tries to conquer them all.\r Like I always say, those days are gone, now animated movies are for all ages. This was a very nicely and carefully written screenplay, did not fail to deliver. Very close to the impact the first movie made, but due to simplicity it stayed a couple of steps behind. Developed well with a bit of suspense, thrill and entertainment. Nothing more we could have asked, a perfect follow-up and hoping to explore beyond lot more in the upcoming movies in this series. Four years gap between the movies is a nice idea and fine breathing space for this franchise fan. A movie must be seen by animation fans, especially if you have already seen the first then don't miss it.\r 8/10",
