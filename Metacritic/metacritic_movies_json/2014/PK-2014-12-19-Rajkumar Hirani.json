K. is a comedy of ideas about a stranger in the city, who asks questions that no one has asked before. They are innocent, child-like questions, but they bring about catastrophic answers. People who are set in their ways for generations, are forced to reappraise their world when they see it from PK's innocent eyes. In the process PK makes loyal friends and powerful foes. Mends broken lives and angers the establishment. P. K.'s childlike curiosity transforms into a spiritual odyssey for him and millions of others. The film is an ambitious and uniquely original exploration of complex philosophies. It is also a simple and humane tale of love, laughter and letting-go. Finally, it is a moving saga about a friendship between strangers from worlds apart.… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The film deftly pokes fun at the foibles of earthlings — especially their warring religions — with warmth and compassion, and shines a light on the contradictions of India’s strict but unwritten social rules.",
    "A biting, whip-smart satire on the thorny subject of organized religion, the Bollywood musical \"PK\" enlightens and provokes through outrageous slapstick.",
    "Mr. Hirani remains an excellent storyteller, weaving his disparate story strands into a convincing, satisfying whole — a rare Bollywood feat."

The clever use of an alien and his schenanignas doesn’t so much call out religion as those who exploit people’s faith for their own desires. The film does so through funny yet thought provoking scenarios. It isn’t attacking religion and never gives a clear answer if there is or isn’t a G-d leaving it up to interpretation. The likeable alien, ideas, songs, and heart warming story lead to a film that everyone should see.",

Some sensibilities were challenged, sure, namely my general distaste for song and dance sequences in films where they're nowhere near necessary. But it's Bollywood. What else should I have expected? I will say that what really ended up surprising me the most was what the film had to say about human mechanisms like faith, understanding and tolerance. Don't let the film's cooky exterior fool you — it muses on these themes in a surprisingly meaningful and apt fashion, even conjuring up a few genuine moments of pause for the audience throughout. Again, a lot of this really felt like a cultural adjustment for me at times, but I do understand and sympathize with the appeal overall.",

The fact that the main lead was supposedly an \"Alien\" makes it even better even though there were some issues regarding this when the film came out . Aamir Khan rarely makes movies but when he does, its best not to miss it, he is one of the finer actors in India and this movie deserves a 10/10 from me for trying to do the unthinkable..A great movie that has to be seen atleast once and superb acting by Aamir Khan..",

Not only are the social norms challenged in this movie very relevant in India, but in throughout most of the world as well. Furthermore, it also had some very funny scenes without having to rely on the cliche kind of toilet humour in 3 Idiots. Instead, it manages to make comedy out of things that people take for granted. To really appreciate this, you have to watch this without reading the reviews beforehand as this movie will have a skewed rating because of how divisive it is with its jokes.",

Talking about the religious issues in India and the Middle East are one of India's film acts of the times. Khan's superb performance escorts this film, and the stories and interludes between the characters are very interesting. Leaving aside the logic, absurdity is the other side of religious culture. Tearing apart the veil of religious and political rule by gods and ghosts, personal belief is the real God.",

In the beginning we are introduced to an unnamed alien who has come to earth to see what life on the planet is like. But then his remote gets stolen and he has to learnt to adapt to the lifestyle of humans.He is very confused about the way humans live. He can't understand the purpose behind clothes, money, language, gestures and finally, religion. And that's where I have a problem with this movie. Don't get me wrong. I'm not gonna talk those \"why is only one religion being talked about\" arguments. Rather my problem is why is religion being given so much emphasis? If I were to make this movie, I'd focus more on the people's lifestyle, which is exactly what the movie was going with and occasionally tries coming back to (like the condom scene).The songs, the acting, the colour palette, everything about the visual and audio was fantastic. The scene in which Jaggu wants to come out of jail made me pause the video so that I could laugh properly. The problems come up in the second half, where the sense of humour suddenly finishes and it starts turning more dramatic. The serious scenes don't hit the same way as the comedy scenes do. After all, we are watching a movie about an alien adjusting to earth's lifestyle. It should have a lot more humour than a grim, gritty feeling.It was fun to watch, but I don't see myself watching this ever again. I know it won't be as funny on seeing the second time. And that's why I'd only recommend it to you if you aren't the \"religion good\" type and can actually see a movie with an open mind, because nowadays a lot of negativity is being spread about this movie.",
