The life of go-getting workaholic architect Ryota (Masaharu Fukuyama)\u2014one of comfort and quietly ordered affluence with his wife Midori (Ono Machiko) and son Keita (Keita Ninomiya)\u2014is violently overturned when hospital administrators reveal the unthinkable: Keita is not his biological son. Due to a mistake made by a negligent nurse, his \"true\" son has been raised in the dishevelled but warm-hearted home of working-class shopkeeper Yudai (Lily Franky) and his wife (Y\u00f4ko Maki). The different approaches of both couples to their excruciating dilemma and the gradual emotional awakening of the all-too-rational Ryota are at the core of this sensitive drama of family feeling, which showcases Kore-eda\u2019s rich sense of humanity.

    "critic_reviews": [
        "Powered by Kore-eda's innate restraint and natural empathy, Like Father, Like Son takes these characters to places they never expected to be. It's unnerving for them, of course, but watching so many hearts hanging in the balance is a rare privilege for us.",
        "The questions posed by Like Father, Like Son are universal in nature and the manner in which Kore-eda addresses them makes for superior drama.",
        "It's charming, gently humorous, and beautifully attuned to the interior lives of children.",
        "Kore-eda has crafted a piercing, tender poem about the bittersweet ebb and flow of paternal love, and his status as Ozu's heir becomes ever more assured.",
        "Hirokazu has crafted a warm and lovely film that suggests the easiest thing about raising a child is embracing how complicated it can be.",
        "Like Father, Like Son is always wise about the quandary faced by the two fathers and the two mothers.",
        "While I\u2019m not a parent myself, I can see how Like Father, Like Son would be a tough sit for any parent. Tough, but extremely worthwhile.",
        "Like Father, Like Son has earned its right to reduce a person to a sobbing wreck.",
        "This is a difficult film, one that asks questions that can\u2019t really be answered. There are a couple of surprises along the way, but more than anything Koreeda is getting at what really makes a family a family.",
        "Like Father, Like Son has still more on its mind \u2014 a vision of a Japan in which work will be balanced with leisure and love.",
        "Even if you\u2019re not boned up on your classic Ozu family tragedies, see it before Spielberg does his remake.",
        "Another quiet delight from Koreeda.",
        "This Japanese film by that country\u2019s preeminent surveyor of contemporary familial relationships explores humanity\u2019s ambivalence regarding the matter.",
        "While the case could be made that Koreeda is merely replicating the world as the blinkered Ryota sees it, the disparity between the characters\u2019 development still leaves you feeling slightly cheated, if only because you want to see more of what this truly gifted student of human behaviour might do with them.",
        "The director takes an unpromising premise - the switched-at-birth plot - and gives us something that's touching and unexpected.",
        "Despite the film\u2019s emphasis on Ryota\u2019s transformation, the most piercing moment for me came in the scene in which his wife anguishes over her guilt in not realizing right away, as a mother, that Keita was not her birth son.",
        "Mr. Hirokazu never overly explains his stories through the dialogue, preferring to tease out their meaning visually.",
        "Kore-eda is himself a father now, which may explain why his work has gotten sunnier.",
        "What makes Like Father, Like Son so quietly powerful is that for the most part, it doesn\u2019t traffic in stereotypes.",
        "The director retains his controlled style even as he moves toward a more traditional narrative mode.",
        "If Like Father, Like Son had set up a genuine conflict here, this could have been a fascinating, even gut-wrenching, melodrama. Instead, writer-director Hirokazu Kore-eda stacks the deck by making Ryota such a highfalutin jerk and Yudai such an exemplar of cozy, loving family life.",
        "The story works wonderfully as an idea, but Kore-eda never quite manages to infuse it with the same depth of feeling his main character goes through.",
        "A bittersweet musing about the nature of parenthood and about the conflict between nature and nurture, it is as banal and insightful as its title.",
        "The film is starved for the kind of nuance Kore-eda wields effortlessly elsewhere. What\u2019s left without it is something merely schematic.",
        "The child performances are stellar, though most striking is how the film\u2019s sympathies spread to everyone.",
        "Although a bit over-neat in its contrasts between the respective families, Like Father, Like Son remains an affecting film, thanks to Fukuyama\u2019s understated turn and Koreeda\u2019s typically graceful visual storytelling.",
        "A lovely film that makes little emotional connection.",
        "There\u2019s typical grace and good humour in Kore-eda\u2019s handling of this all-but-impossible situation. But the film\u2019s critical lack of dramatic nuance undercuts its emotional resonance.",
        "This is a sweet-natured, but essentially undemanding film from Kore-eda.",
        "Like Father, Like Son has the overall depth and tenor of a Lifetime movie. Kore-Eda can do much better.",
        "Like Father, Like Son grows on you, subtly and over time. Just as with the unexpected realignments forced on its characters, it may be difficult to fall in love with the movie, but eventually you do warm up to it.",
        "The film scores all of its thematic points early, commenting intriguingly, if ultimately rather obviously, on the demands of Japanese patriarchy."

This question haunts parents everywhere and is the main focus of Hirokazu Koreeda\u2019s newest film Like\u2018Can you really love a child without your blood\u2019?\r What would you be willing to do for a child you barely know and never helped raise? This question haunts parents everywhere and is the main focus of Hirokazu Koreeda\u2019s newest film Like Father, Like Son; a gut-wrenching family drama set on the basis of mixed identities, unwanted truths and the indefinite definition of happiness. Winner of the Jury Prize at Cannes in 2013, Koreeda\u2019s newest feature is sure to stir a pot full of mixed emotions.\r Ryota Nonomiya (Masaharu Fukuyama) is a determined Japanese business executive. He humbly avoids the spotlight, instead allowing his incomparable work ethic and determination to take the spotlight. He is irreplaceable professionally, but his marital life is in turmoil and he suffers failing relationships with his wife Midori (Machiko Ono) and son Keita (Keita Nonomiya). Ryota despises messy situations, so when he returns home to news of a phone call from the local hospital where their son was born, his only request is that developments won\u2019t be messy.\r After extensive tests, Ryota and his wife learn that their son Keita was switched with another boy at birth. Ryota shelves his instinct to find out who and what is behind this mistake, and meets with the Saiki\u2019s (Rir\u00ee Furank\u00ee and Y\u00f4ko Makiwho), the people who have been raising Ryusei Saiki (Sh\u00f4gen Hwang), Ryota\u2019s son by blood.\r Devastated and determined to come up with a plan to \u2018exchange\u2019 the boys swiftly and without much emotional damage, the families agree to start switching the boys on weekends, gradually acclimatizing them to each of their new home environments.\r Although the film is set with the anticipation that the lives of both sets of parents would be showcased, Like Father, Like Son sets its sights on the Nonomiya family, focusing on Ryota; a professional who is driving his family up the class ladder in a socially driven Japan. Koreeda takes you through the different struggles of accepting the truth. At first, the Nonomiyas struggle with the reality of raising a son that is not their own. They then contemplate how they could fail to notice different physical features between father and son, suffering the cruelty of those who did notice. Ryota is the main focus of Koreeda\u2019s scrutinizing observation while his wife Midori is left at the wayside. Koreeda seems fascinated by the idea of such a powerful and determined man grappling with such a rare, indescribable situation where no obvious victory is clear.\r Perhaps Koreeda sees a lot of himself in Ryota; the story is supposedly set around recent real-life events, although, the specifications of these factual events are never brought into the spotlight. For most of the movie, Ryota tries to fix his problems with his power, status and wealth. He immediately enlists the help of his old roommate, a powerful lawyer who wants to diffuse the situation as quickly and painlessly as possible, without ever providing Ryota with any emotional or paternal comfort. Like almost everyone in the Nonomiya family, Ryota must face the situation alone.\r Once Ryota takes the reigns on figuring out how to handle the situation, he finds that real power lies in his ability to connect with his family and disconnect from his professional life. As stern and composed as Ryota remains, he reveals himself to the audience as the most cowardly in the film by always looking to his professional life as a distraction from the conflicts in his personal life.\r In the first meeting between the parents, Koreeda introduces us to a blend of very bizarre comic relief, for a very morbid concept of grief. The majority of the comedy comes from the other father, Yudai (Furank\u00ee), an appliance repair man whose mantra in life is in stark contrast to Ryota. Yudai would rather put off a task until tomorrow. His initial idea to exchange the children as if they were simply pets, sets up a very optimistic man, but also a very flawed character. Yudai is anything but an absent father, spending most of his days making minimal sales at his shop (which also serves as the Saiki\u2019s home), and fixing battery powered toys or flying kites with his children. Yudai is the man Ryota never wants to be, while also showing us the man Ryota never could be.\r Aside from their ambitions, the two families also differ greatly socially and economically. While the obviously lower classed family take baths together and spends their days playing together, the other family lives in an apartment that resembles a high class hotel. These little but quite obvious social differences also exhibits the film\u2019s implicit question of nature versus nurture. It allows audiences to question whether the social classes of the families should matter, especially when talking about Keita going to the Saiki\u2019s home. These small differences in their upbringing are never highlighted, but are always left lingering in the back of your mind.",

Its quite a thought provoking film. I thought the topic was handled quite well, infact it felt a bit like a documentary film at times, more than perhaps a 'full blown drama' film. I liked the music played at the end - it gave it a haunting feel. I would recommend this film, although if you prefer quite high action/'busy' type films, then this one may be a bit slow and not to your liking.",
