  "critic_reviews": [
    "Evans pays careful attention to atmosphere, while giving wide berth to cinematographers Dimas Imam Subhono and Matt Flannery, who find beauty among the mayhem. Everything on screen is crystal clear and vibrant, like a city street right after the rain.",
    "Hyper-violent it may be but there is beauty in its brutality.",
    "If The Raid: Redemption was a thrashing drum solo, its sequel is the opulent symphony where every instrument is played with fevered inspiration.",
    "Miraculously, the new picture makes the old one feel like Evans was just warming up.",
    "Wow. For those with strong constitutions, The Raid 2 offers one of the most intense motion picture experiences available; it may also be the most violent movie ever to be released into theaters.",
    "If what you’re after is insane, mind-bogglingly violent martial arts action, “The Raid 2” is quite possibly the ultimate.",
    "The Raid 2 lets its warriors rip for two and a half thrilling hours. With the precision of dance and the punch of a KO champion, Evans keeps the action coming like nobody's business. The wow factor is off the charts.",
    "Good luck finding a modern martial-arts epic that can even hold a candle to it.",
    "The Raid 2 will make you feel like Christmas came nine months early. Some action sequels don't know when to say when. But here's one where too much is just the right amount.",
    "The Raid 2 brings the noise, but length, repetition and too much space also make it a slightly reduced echo of its predecessor.",
    "A bulkier, slower beast than Evans’ first film. But when it enters combat mode, it’s more raucously bloodthirsty than anything you’ve ever seen. Unless you’re Ross Kemp.",
    "The tedium of The Raid 2’s setup is offset by some of the most jaw-dropping, bone-crunching, flesh-ripping setpieces ever filmed.",
    "No other filmmaker on the planet can touch Evans for long-take beatdowns and wildly inventive flourishes.",
    "There are tradeoffs with the switch to a more epic, ambitious canvas, but Gareth Evans’ action sequel in most ways that count is an even more masterful jolt of high-energy genre filmmaking.",
    "Though the addition of “extras” like multiple locations, a larger cast of non-fodder characters and oh, actual dialogue, makes The Raid 2 much less unique a film than its predecessor, it still registers as a pretty vibrant entry into the Yakuza genre.",
    "The Raid 2 doesn’t so much raise the bar for action filmmaking as it pummels that bar into a mangled piece of metal that resembles nothing if not the gauntlet that’s been thrown down here. Just don’t forget to breathe.",
    "Gareth Evans’s sequel to his surprise 2011 hit takes the original’s basic formula – lots of people pounding on each other in close quarters – and simply stretches it over a much longer running time.",
    "Those with a high tolerance for violence and gore — at one point, Rama battles assassins labeled “Baseball Bat Man’’ and “Hammer Girl’’ simultaneously — will eat up The Raid 2.",
    "And yes, it’s all insanely, relentlessly gory. You could say (and some will) that the gratuitousness of the violence in The Raid 2 is a problem. But it all functions as part of the surreal dance of death.",
    "As inventive as the action sequences are, there are too many of them and they tend to go on far too long — the movie is just shy of two-and-a-half hours. Still, Evans' filmmaking has undergone some impressive fine-tuning for The Raid 2. It is something to see — if you have the stomach for it.",
    "The pleasant surprise of Gareth Evans’s sturdy sequel to “The Raid: Redemption” is that neither its undercover drama nor its two-and-a-half-hour length bog down the bracing, and numerous, fight fests.",
    "Much as I enjoyed watching most of it, I was deeply grateful when it was over and feel no strong desire to see the inevitable “Raid 3.”",
    "It’s hard to shake a nagging feeling of more is less; with its convoluted plot mechanics clearly cribbed from past thriller templates, the film never quite generates or sustains its predecessor’s pure sense of menace.",
    "The Raid 2 takes a substantially different tack from that of its 2011 predecessor, adding a convoluted plot and only intermittently attending to the sort of acrobatic ass-kicking for which the original became a global smash.",
    "The film was technically astonishing and yet brazenly simple.",
    "The plot is murky, the acting is melodramatic and the movie is way too long, but the target audience will salivate over the inventively choreographed set-pieces.",
    "The brawling itself is every bit as inventive and exhilarating this time around... The script and acting, however, prove less successful.",
    "It's all showy viscera, no ballet, and wan attempts at the gravity of something like Drug War, with implicit statements made about the deadening nature of violence or the moral equivalency of state-sanctioned and criminal force, don't come close to cohering.",
    "This newer installment is every bit its predecessor's match as far as action goes. Where it exceeds it, however, is in the between-the-fights moments.",
    "The Raid 2's faults are not in Evans's technique – he's unusually adept at capturing the art of violence. Instead, the film suffers from too much potential.",
    "The action stuff in The Raid 2, while likely to alienate the squeamish and summon dark thoughts of cinematic nihilism amongst overthinking highbrows, really IS like nothing else out there.",
    "The raw ingredients of Raid 2 are superb. But the overall effect is gluttonous and queasy.",
    "“The Raid” was a great action film in which the violence, excessive though it was, served as obstacles in the hero’s simple quest. In Raid 2 the violence is the movie, its excess used to cover for an inept story, thinly-drawn characters and dead spots.",
    "For better or worse, the blood and bone-crunching remains most prominent."

It was an amazing theater experience with everyone reacting to every breaking bone, and cheers for every perfectly executed and choreographed fight scene. I really wouldn’t want to spoil anyone’s chance at seeing any of these fights fresh. But that hallway. Oh man that hallway. The beautiful choreography shows off the mastery of everyone involved. The visual effects soaked the audience in blood after the choreography severed our spines. This movie will kick your ass and leave you breathless. If the Raid took action back to basics, The Raid 2 beats the basics to death with a hammer. Gareth Evans seems to be calling out names and taking attendance. Hollywood needs to get on this mans level. A compelling cast. Excruciating fights. A narrative that leaves the audience in complete suspense. The Raid 2 is one you need to see.",

      "content": "A true masterpiece in the world of martial arts films. As an absolutely huge martial arts fanatic, I am proud to have seen some of the greatest martial arts films ever created from the old brilliant classics such as One-Armed Swordsman orA true masterpiece in the world of martial arts films. As an absolutely huge martial arts fanatic, I am proud to have seen some of the greatest martial arts films ever created from the old brilliant classics such as One-Armed Swordsman or Seven Samurai to the new timeless treasures such as Ip Man or 13 Assassins.\rHaving made it my goal to see some of the best martial arts films this world has to offer, I can safely say that this movie goes into my TOP 10 movies of all time list.\rThe simple yet exciting story from the first Raid film was made a bit more complex and fleshed out in this stimulating and dramatic sequel. Gareth Evans truly outdid himself with his fantastic writing and directing in this piece. The story had the perfect balance of drama and action which isn't easy to accomplish, and when the action did come, it blew me away! The fight choreography and absolutely brutal combat in the first film was fantastic, to be able to go to the next level and still keep it fresh is no small feat! The fighting didn't seem too ridiculous as a lot of martial arts films tend to do (but we still enjoy seeing it), it seemed more realistic and more efficient, which is what Pencak Silat is all about, a wonderful martial art used in creative and spectacular ways. The cinematography and editing in this movie is also something I really enjoyed, everything was perfect in those aspects, used to really make the story telling more clear and thrilling.\r There aren't many martial arts films these days that can REALLY impress me these days, but this did it. Can the 3rd Raid film top this? While that seems impossible, knowing Gareth Evans, the brilliant Iko Uwais and the team, they can do it.",

      "content": "Picking up almost immediately where the first film left off, our protagonist Rama finds himself a target for both the various mafia organizations in Jakarta as well as the increasingly corrupted state of the police department. To bring bothPicking up almost immediately where the first film left off, our protagonist Rama finds himself a target for both the various mafia organizations in Jakarta as well as the increasingly corrupted state of the police department. To bring both sides to justice, Rama embarks on a mission to infiltrate one of the major gangs in the city as an undercover cop to lure the big fishes out to dry. No badge, no rules. The story in Raid 2 is far more complex and enticing, as there are many upon many characters revealed and developed, all of them having hidden meanings and unique features that make them stand out as well as being integral parts of the story that gives every one of them a part to play in a puzzle drenched in blood. The worries for Rama's survival are retained from the original, as we get more scenes involving him trying to reconnect with his family, that he is forced to abandon for years, but just when it feels like it'd get too soapy, Evans gladly concentrates on other characters as well, in fact one of the most captivating and entertaining parts of The Raid 2 is seeing how so many different characters get their time to shine, and most of them are quite compelling by the end of the film, in fact many of them you start to care about from seemingly small figures such as Assassin Prakoso(played by the previous film's Yayan Ruhian aka Mad Dog) with his own problems and issues in life and family, to big timers such as Indonesian gang leader Bangun played stoically and honorably by Tio Pakusadewo and his arrogant and ambitious, yet understandably so son Uco(Arifin Putra), among many, I mean MANY. The run time of 2 hours and a half is both a great marketing tool for the action but also for this very well-told narrative, that flows as well as all the action.Speaking of action, there's a LOT more of it here, in fact as indicated by a youtube compilation of all fight scenes featured in the film, there's about an hour of them, HALF OF THE MOVIE basically. And glorious it is, with once again excellent choreography by Uwais and Ruhian as they vary and establish different fighting styles for different characters. Two of my personal favorites being Baseball Bat Man and Hammer Girl, both get terrific introductory action sequences to show of their skills, and it's here where the picture really shines, focusing on the individual characters and building up their personality during the fights, a brilliant little piece of visual storytelling. The other amazing aspect of the film is something that makes it stand over the original's action is the variety of the action found here. From fights in small bathroom cubicles, to massive prison riots, to nightclub dance battles, to **** CAR CHASES WITH FREAKING FIGHTS INSIDE THE CARS, and the epic seemingly never-ending and wishfully never-ending finale showdowns. Evans' direction is once again nothing short of stunning and kinetic, mixing long takes and fluid camerawork, with precise editing to match the pace of the fight and induce gut-wrenching, and jaw-dropping reactions to every bone-break, throat slash, hammering and just annihilating bevy of punches and kicks. Pencak Silat has never looked so brutal, pummeling and fast, while at the same time being graceful and absolutely beautiful, there's something great about the film's approach to violence, it may deter some but for the lookers of vicious, hard-hitting action insanity, The Raid 2 delivers and then some. The final battle between Uwais and Cecep Arif Rahman's Assassin is to this day ONE OF THE BEST final fights I've seen in cinema history, a kitchen and kerambit knives have never been used this creatively for sure, Joe Trapenese and Fajar Yuskemal's score is energizing to the point of an action movie meltdown, just awesome use of drums, and orchestra, that when viewed on its own lasts the length of the fights themselves, meaning every hit is choreographed not only in the performance but also in music, the culmination of the kitchen battle is nothing short of masterful, kerambits cross, stomachs, arms and legs get opened and the score just keeps on rolling like it's cheese trying to carve its way into a hamburger, one that is already tearing its own **** as well. That may be the weirdest and the most graphic food making description you've possibly ever heard, but what can I say, dinner is best served cold and sliced open.The Raid 2 is simply a masterpiece, a sequel that feels both fresh and true to the original, that makes everything that it did well even better and evens the odds for the things that the original was criticized for, this is something I'll be showing to anyone who ever asks me what my favorite action films of all time is, cause while I can think of many great ones, The Raid 2 always is the best one, for being a combination of everything. A 10/10.",

Fights are blazing, choreographed with such precision that each death-inducing blow produces an impact across the cinema. Gareth Evans conducts a cinematic plays stringed by excessive bloodbath, his visions might be over-the-top, but they will leave both fans of the action genre and casual audience cringe breathlessly.\r The prequel had some poor unintentionally funny dialogues, even more so if one understood Indonesian. For this movie, the script has been polished and scenes are constructed more consistently. Granted, it's still troubled by some setbacks of usual action movies', but there are more engaging and personal lines to be had. Acting is improved with the addition of Arifin Putra as Uco, the son of mafia boss who is eager to prove himself. The character is ruthless in his actions and also passionately fueled by ambition and greed, Arifin Putra portrays it well with a hint of doubt or maybe even guilt.\r Alex Abbad as Bejo is quite harrowing despite his disability. There's a disturbing untrustworthy feel surrounding the character, the fact that he has legion of assassins make him more treacherous. This army of assassins almost seemingly pops out of some Japanese anime, akin to what inspired Kill Bill's or Matrix's. Among them there are not many that stands out in acting department, what makes them memorable are their choice of weapons and the body count they pile with them. A visually impaired girl swinging double hammers in a subway, that's gold.\r Iko Uwais as the leading protagonist performs respectably. He's a man with good ideology and equal ill fate; it's easy to sympathize for his cause. He has done a good job playing a difficult role, but his strength lies in the action sequences. To say that the battles are brutal is an understatement; these warriors unleash pure mayhem on each other. Every broken bones and limbs are executed with much gusto, blood sprayed from all angles, this may very well be the most brutal thing one can see on cinema.\r Cinematography is splendid, it's apparent that Gareth Evans was motivated by many Hollywood movies. Scenes are slick, utilizing different camera angles for best view of the action and often time follow it in continuous shot. The cameras seem almost glued to the characters as they rush and rip each other apart, yet they will pan or zoom out just in the right moment for the audience to appreciate the intricacy of the movie's complex action choreography. Its particular car chase scene takes the viewer swirling through the vehicles astoundingly; it's the best chase scene since The Matrix Reloaded.\r The Raid 2: Berandal has refined the plot from the prequel and in terms of sheer action carnage none can rival it.",

To understandPlease tell me this is the most popular movie out right now. Please, it deserves to be. This movie is without a doubt my favorite fighting film since Bruce Lee's and Tony Jaa's work. This is the best action movie in a long time. To understand why this movie is so amazing you really have to be a fan of martial arts or kung fu movies. A movie with a camera positions that's actually zoomed out far enough to see everything. Actors actually punching/kicking each other (not hard obviously) to really make it look legit. Fight choreography, that you can't see being choreographed. Awesome old school car stunts with real stunt men. Man I'm so happy right now, I haven't seen a movie this awesome in a while. The undercover cop isn't anything new but the way they made their spin on it is perfect. I know they are Indonesian but I they seem like Yakuza to me with their traditions, honor, fighting instead of guns and pride for their territory.\r So details (no spoilers don't worry) Raid has always been high paced fast gory action. I enjoyed the Raid Redemption but as far as overall cinematic quality goes it was just gory awesome fighting, without context we won't really care who's fighting who. But Raid 2 provides that context and makes you immersed in it's story and characters. Honestly, I don't mean any offense but I'm surprised this was made by the same people. This movie has amazing shots and they give a great sense of character development by showing us who they are. So Raid 2 not only stands on a high leg from it's amazing action but the cinematic quality is just beautiful. The sad moments really are tragic and the actors display raw emotion which help builds the tension and atmosphere of a scene. And when a character is supposed to be blank, cold and brutal you see that too. Baseball bat boy... oh man he's awesome. The imagery in this film is just perfect. I really don't know what else to say. Yes it's a gory film, over gory? Maybe but it's realistic, if you shoot someone in the face with shotgun they won't have a tiny whole in their head... it will be in pieces everywhere. So I don't see over gory as much as somewhat realistic. Oh it has a lot of gory scenes but I don't think it's over the top.\r Please go see this movie, it deserves your money. It works hard for your money. It wants you to have a good time. And a good time you will have. Seriously I want to see more movies like this.",

That somehow Gareth Evans managed to up his game exponentially in this sequel to one of the most gloriously violent movies of allI know what you want to hear. You want to hear that The Raid 2 is bigger, badder and bolder than the first one. That somehow Gareth Evans managed to up his game exponentially in this sequel to one of the most gloriously violent movies of all time. To his credit, The Raid 2 is in every way a bigger more ambitious movie, offering a more elaborate story, a slew of new characters, and bigger battle ratios. But sometimes more isn't better; it's just more.\r The Raid 2 picks up shortly after the story of The Raid: Redemption left off. Rama (Iko Uwais) has brought Lieutenant Wahyu (Pierre Gruno) to the authorities; the wounded Bowo (Tegar Satrya) is promptly excused to receive medical care. Then, a special internal branch of the police force offers Rama a dangerous mission he can't turn down. They want to topple the organized crime of Jakarta, and to do it they need an inside man. So, Rama goes undercover in prison to befriend Uco (Arifin Putra), the spoiled, power-hungry son of a top crime boss. Upon the pair's release, a power struggle ignites that makes Rama's real identity the least of his worries.\r First off, it needs to be said that The Raid 2 is a sequel in only the most ornamental of terms. Evans, who wrote and directed the action-packed thriller, races to cut out every surviving character from the first film--save Rama--in the first ten minutes. From there, Rama's arc is overshadowed by the brooding quest of Uco to prove himself as a man/crime boss. Further muddying the waters of this so-called sequel is the recasting of Yayan Ruhian, who memorably played Mad Dog in the first film. He's back as a different hit man named Prakoso, this one cloaked in a ratty beard and bolstered with a tragic backstory. It's great to see him--and his outstanding martial arts skills--again, but it's nonetheless jarring. Really, The Raid 2 could too easily have been an entirely separate Jakarta-set crime drama chock-full of brutal battle scenes and a convoluted plot. But this could have been fine if it weren't so bogged down by too many ideas.\r The Raid: Redemption was a slick and satisfying movie that not only offered stupendous and sickening fight scenes but also a tight plot that perfectly fueled the narrative. In the sequel, Evans once more offers jaw-dropping fight scenes full of surprises and lightning fast hand-to-hand combat, plus generous sprays of CGI blood. But they aren't as all-around successful this time. Part of the problem is the settings. In the first film, one battle after another broke out in dingy, grey apartments that were nearly identical. With nothing much to look at in the setting, audiences were able to tune in on the gloriously intense fight choreography. But when Evans throws his fighters in a flashy hibachi restaurant or a sprawling pit of mud packed with rioting prisoners, it's difficult to narrow in on the action, and the impact is lost.\r Still, the bigger problem is that these fight scenes are nested in an overly complicated mafia plot that bloats the running time to 150-minutes. As Uco strolls through a predictable pattern of frustration to betrayal, his and Rama's story is staggered by fight scenes, which makes them feel shockingly episodic. Worse yet, because so much attention goes to Uco's lackluster thread, other more intriguing elements--flashy new assassins Prakoso, Hammer Girl, and the less eye-catching Baseball Bat Man --are woefully underdeveloped. Sure, Hammer Girl looks cool as hell in the trailers, but don't expect much more than that.\r Don't get me wrong: The Raid 2 offers exactly the kind of pulse-pounding, mind-snapping fight scenes we came to expect because of the sensational original. But Evans had no editing eye when it came to shaping his story, and as such the film feels more like a rant than a cohesive narrative, or a powerful part two to Rama's tale. There are just too many ideas here. Rama's adventure is sidelined for Uco's story. Uco's story eats up tons of screentime, leaving little room for the proper development of the sequel's more compelling characters, or even a solid build for Rama's thread. The lop-sided narrative deadens the emotional impact of the deadly finale. As someone who was positively crazy over The Raid: Redemption, it pains me to say it, but The Raid 2 is half wildly entertaining, and half a slog.  BEST ACTION MOVIE EVER !",

No one is a hero, No one is a villain, except for the really violent ones(which is everyone). Also, rather than making the fights art, they are gore. It's as if the producers heard people saying they liked when in the 1st movie, so they made a film of finales. The rest of the film is a collection of introductions to characters about to die. This guy is good, so his death matters, this one is violent and a villain, this one too. Are you happy they died? Are you sad? As a fan of the 1st movie, I'm just disappointed.",

Many people liked the first, but I was not because it was not my type. There was no story in it, but a game style of presentation which focused mainly on stunts and I had seen better than that. For a sequel to that, I mean this movie was no chance to complain about in any level. The story, stunts, performances, direction all were top notch and easily can surpass to grab the title for 'this year's best martial art/stunt movie'. I had no expectations before a watch and after a watch got so excited for having it.\r After completing somewhat a successful rescue mission that took place in a tenement run by a ruthless gangster, now Rama is assigned to a new undercover operation. Temporarily says goodbye to his regular life and to his wife. To get in a position it takes months of hard work and he successfully makes into one of the members of the gang that he's after. Soon the ideas vary like to initiate new techniques to rule the underworld makes crack within the mob family. So the clash happens randomly to take over the top position from one another. In between the cop's role and the final stand brings the result to this story with plenty of awesome stunt sequences.\r Worth to spend our time for this 150 minute long movie, especially if you are the greatest fan of the mixed martial arts then you got a solid reason to go for this. For every 10-15 minutes there is one stunt sequence, all I can say is it was very well patterned in a decent story. Yes, the story was not a brand new, it was what we have already seen many times in the Japanese Yakuza, Hollywood, European et cetera undercover cop stories. But to see the new cast from the new region of the earth's surface it was fantastic. I have not seen many Indonesian movies, so probably this could be the best movies from there to the international standards. This country should take cues from this movie to make consistent from now on like what Tony Jaa's movies did for Thai movies.\r ‘‘We may be after the same thing...\r...But I'm not going to follow the path as you to get there.’’\r Regarding the undercover cop theme, the lead character Rama was not the superior, but individually, many characters had produced incredible equality by exhibiting breathtaking stunt skills. Truly to say Rama vanishes in between all these guys. He's used only for the opening and the end portions, that's it. So that means this movie is beyond his presence that will definitely surprise the viewers. The gore was very strong, focused too deep details like ripping skin, breaking bones, smashing heads, hammering. Definitely there is going to be another sequel and my expectations rose high for that. There should be no 'I missed it' or 'not seen yet' in the mouths of movie fanatics because it is a must see.",

Not only does the sequel have better fight scenes, it has more of them, and there's more to be involved in the fights here as the movie is not limited to one location.\rNow, the story is terrible and the entire goal of the movie that is plainly spelled out for the main character, Rama, in the first 5 mins. However, as the movie goes on, the goal changes and at what point, I couldn't tell you and I don't think the main character could tell you either. The other thing I didn't like about this movie was the fact that they brought back the actor of the villain from the big fight scene in the first one to play another character here. While he doesn't play a huge role in this one, it's still very jarring to see a guy who was such an evil dude in the first one come back to play another character who serves as cannon fodder to the bad plot.\rEven still, taking this purely by its action sequences alone, this is easily the best action/kung fu movie I've seen in over a decade. There's more to love here and the creativity alone with some of the fight scenes, especially the ones at the end of the movie, are some of the best I've ever seen. The music goes extremely well with it too and really gives this the extra power it needs to make each and every hit feel painful.\rI would compare watching a movie like this to going out and getting fast food. You know what you expect and if you don't get what you expect, it won't be very good. Who cares about plot, or calories in the fast food example, when you are setting out, from the beginning, looking for one thing in particular? I personally love this movie and I can't recommend it enough to people looking for a stellar action/kung fu movie.",

The difference being, people should not expect more of the exact same, this franchise has evolved.\r The film picks up about half an hour after the first one, with the hero, Rama, now having to go undercover to find more corrupt cops and protect his family.\r If The Raid could be likened to films such as Assault on Precinct 13 then the second film can be described as part Infernal Affairs, part The Godfather. The action is still there, extreme and over the top (not a complaint), but Evans has still kept the tension that made the original so extraordinary.\rThe final fight scene is immense and superior to the confrontation in number one between Rama and Mad Dog. Where that was raw and gritty, The Raid 2 produces an exchange that is technically amazing and visually stunning.\r I was worried that stretching the run time from 100 minutes to two and a half hours would damage the film. Although the film could easily be trimmed down by about 30 minutes, I wasn't sitting in my seat praying for the end; the balance between action and tension kept my interest until the very end.",

I was floored then. I sent a Facebook shot out to family and friends to watch this movie (I rarely do that on movies) I kept prodding my sister to watch so we finally loaded it for another family night movie. ( no children in house )\rI am really not sure what in the hell the 11 people so far that had someone bad to say about this movie were actually smoking because this movie has now set the standard so far up on the bar, it will be almost impossible to let alone equal this movie let  alone beat it!!!!!!!  Lets start with the storyline that was not only genius, fluent and seamlessly continued from the Raid 1. New characters were introduced without any plausibility of why they were in this masterful plot of corruption and revenge.  Lets now move on to how the artistic, visual and choreographic masterpiece this brilliant director transferred his imagination to the big screen.  TRULY UNMATCHED so far.\r Now lets get to the nitty gritty!!! The Beautiful and ( yes Masterful is being used again) Masterful FIGHT SCENES! !! COUNT THEM at lease 10 !! Again, count them!! 10 brilliant awesome non stop action martial arts fight scenes that not even Enter The Dragon (sorry Bruce) could even come close to. The visual angles combined with the brutality and gore of impacts simply left you oooooing and **** after each killer finishing moves!!! There is one fight scene where the director did such a incandescent job at combining rhythmic tribal track with a luminous visual artistry to a brutal fight scene. This movie as said is not for the faint of heart nor children.  True action lovers will add this movie to their list of must see , and will always see movie list.  Hands down!! This movie is in its own stratosphere! !!",

The success of the first movie means bigger budget, means more locations, more \"distinct\" baddies, bigger odds, more brutal fighting, etc. Unfortunately, the old adage \"less is sometimes more\" has been forgotten, and it - in my opinion, applies to this movie series.Where The Raid was a more compact movie, that took place in a very limited space and time range and had a fairly simple premise - and it worked well - The Raid 2 tries to make things more complex, but the limitations of the team's capability show here, and it leads to low quality story and setting. The fighting goes from realistic (mostly) raw and gritty to comics style brutality and inhuman feats.Where The Raid required some suspension of disbelief, The Raid 2 requires it from start to finish with some moments where thinking anything at all is detrimental to the enjoyment of the movie.Overall, it was an okay experience for a one time viewing. I don't even begrudge the attempt to take the movie further. It just wasn't done well. I'll re-watch the first one at times. I don't think I ever thought about re-watching 2.",
