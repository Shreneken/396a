  "critic_reviews": [
    "Take my word for it, or better yet go find out for yourself: Big Hero 6 is a treat.",
    "East meets West to immensely satisfying effect in the vibrant mash-up of an animated romp, Big Hero 6.",
    "Sweet and sharp and exciting and hilarious, Big Hero 6 comes to the rescue of what's become a dreaded movie trope — the origin story — and launches the superhero tale to pleasurable new heights.",
    "It’s a movie that’s as fun to watch as it is funny. But the real appeal of Big Hero 6 isn’t its action. It’s the central character’s heart.",
    "With a film this funny, exciting and visually stimulating, who cares if you know exactly what's going to happen next, and when.",
    "The storytelling is solid, propelled by characters that you come to care about.",
    "At times, Big Hero 6 gets a little too noisy for its own good, but that never manages to drown out its many quieter charms.",
    "Whatever flaws it has are ones of over-enthusiasm and over-ambition and are therefore easy to forgive, especially because when it works, it really works.",
    "If there is any complaint to be laid against Big Hero 6, it is that the team itself takes a back seat. The story is primarily about the relationship between Hiro and Baymax. This is not a negative comment because the relationship between the boy and his robot is endearing and effectively told.",
    "After \"Frozen,\" Disney delivers a heart-melter. The sweet, witty main pairing focuses a potentially busy, derivative super-group tale. Stay for the sting: Big Hero 7 is practically a given.",
    "The Scooby-Doo-ish central plot is forgivable in a movie with so much visual verve, energetic action and a character so wondrously designed as Baymax.",
    "Amid all the nerd-inspired firepower that gives the movie much of its flash, the big boy's droning tone proves to be the film's stealth weapon, perfect for pulling off highly targeted comic strikes.",
    "Big Hero 6 is good enough to transcend its blah ending and to make the case that every superhero story should be entirely animated.",
    "It ultimately amounts to a feature-length origin story, but with characters this unknown and execution this fun, that’s an asset, not a liability.",
    "Big Hero 6 was executive produced by Pixar guru John Lasseter. You can see the influence in the high quality, from the appealing 3D animation to the unusually sharp story and script (a cooperative effort credited to seven people).",
    "A melding of old and new modes of animation, in which the attentive artistry of the past coexists with the hyper-detailed, computer-generated present.",
    "Another friggin’ superhero story that acknowledges comic-book tropes while rarely subverting them, Big Hero 6 is powered nonetheless by its witty charms, lively animation, and swift pace.",
    "This one's a winner. And Baymax, baby, call your agent. You're about to be a household name.",
    "Although competently made and consistently engaging, there's nothing special about this animated superhero origin story.",
    "An action adventure that puts brain ahead of brawn as a valued commodity is always reason to celebrate. Add in the considerable heart that Baymax contributes (with elements borrowed from both “WALL-E” and “Up”), and you have a winner.",
    "The most endearing character in Disney's animated superhero animated movie is a one-man Affordable Care Act. (Make that a one-robot ACA.)",
    "A rousing movie that’s satisfyingly infused with traditional Disney sentiment.",
    "Big Hero 6 is second-tier Disney/Marvel entertainment, fine for a day out with the children yet doesn't seem enough, after the creative advances of Wreck-It Ralph and the emotional heft of Frozen.",
    "The visuals are splendid. Even close-ups of face and hair are something to marvel at.",
    "Without making a big deal out of it, Big Hero 6 features a shrewdly balanced and engaging group of male and female characters of various ethnic backgrounds. It'd be nice to live in a world where this wasn't worth a mention, but it is. And yet the movie belongs to the big guy.",
    "It’s manipulative and overlong, too loud and “Incredibles” action-packed for the very young. But the manipulation errs on the side of mercy, compassion, sacrifice and humanity.",
    "As much as the action stuff works and would indicate that any other property Marvel entrusts to the animation side of things is in good hands, Big Hero 6 gets by more on the charms of its comedy.",
    "Therein lies part of the dissonance with this often-wonderful, deceptively strange movie. You could get emotional whiplash watching it.",
    "Big Hero 6 is easier to admire than to love. It veers from chipper to noisy to dark stretches where it grapples with adult-sized grief.",
    "After establishing its fresh and relatable origin story, the movie gets bogged down with a relatively generic villain’s power-hungry schemes. Still, there’s enough that’s new and different about Big Hero 6 to get excited about, especially for those still too young for Marvel’s more intense live-action fare.",
    "Big Hero 6’s considerable graces as an animated film — its fantastical layouts and bouncy sense of figure and motion — are offset by its deficiencies as a second-rate superhero flick.",
    "Gorgeous and disturbing, Big Hero 6 is a departure for Disney: a film targeted at older kids, and the studio's first venture into straight-up comic book culture. Walt would flip in his cryogenic chamber if he saw this anime-style production.",
    "Consider it a more family-friendly \"Guardians of the Galaxy,\" with the added kiddie appeal of a big, inflatable windbag to laugh at and love.",
    "The film quickly becomes a study of grief and retribution, and the question of how exactly technology can and should be utilized in the treatment of these emotions.",
    "It is, after all, the Baymax show - and he is cute, cuddly, comedy gold. Fortunately, although Big Hero 6 has various flaws, he's generally on hand to patch them.",
    "Especially when Baymax is onscreen doing his adorable-puffy-robot thing, Big Hero 6 qualifies as a better-than-average kids’ movie with enough cross-generational appeal to make it a fine choice for a family weekend matinee. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that this film was designed to function as a starter kit for future Marvel aficionados.",
    "As far as 'toons go, it's probably most reminiscent of Pixar's \"The Incredibles,\" given that both are stories about superhero teams. There are also echoes of \"How to Train Your Dragon\" in the flying scenes, featuring little Hiro perched atop Baymax's back. But even then, Big Hero 6 still feels like its own, distinct creature.",
    "The animation is fluid and inventive, balancing action and slapstick with aplomb.",
    "Big Hero 6 even has a title that sounds like a product ordered off the takeout menu of the type of restaurant that recombines a few elements in many ways. That could work fine, if any of the ingredients were particularly flavorful."

It seemed like it could have been a character driven Disney film. This along with Wreck It Ralph have attempted to hijack the legacy of Disney Animation to loud and obnoxious action scenes strung together with a cliche plot.  Once again, this should have been under the Pixar label as not to ruin Walt's legacy.  Cashing in on their Marvel acquisition, The Walt Disney Company has attempted to make a kids movie which resembles every single other super hero movie out there.  Can you imagine if a classic like Aladdin just had 5 minute long action sequences strung together instead of jokes and songs?

ItMy friends 5 year old noticed the holes in this movie... what a let down. The animation looks good, the characters are ok on their own, but the story... oh my god the story is horrible. Cliche after cliche and forced emotional situations. It was clearly following a formula rather than a story. Whoever wrote the story needs to be shot for how badly it progressed. I actually predicted the entire movie in the 1st 10 minutes (I didnt know anything about it going in) and the only thing I got wrong was who the villain would be. I figured that the movie seems to cheesy that it would try another predictable twist like making the elder brother the bad guy and he is doing to get his GF back. That is how predictable the movie was. No originality whatsoever and it got worse as it went along. I almost puked when i saw it turn to a bad superhero flick. My friends 5 year old asked us why the kid didnt just build more of the small robots or make a new remote control (referring to the brain control interface).... how sad is it that a 5 year old figured that out? Not good.\r Despite how bad the story was, I thought beta max or whatever his name was, was a funny character. The aunt was funny too. Everyone else was retarded including the main character Hiro.\r Overall, average at best. Highly overrated.",

Big Hero 6 combines the two and aside from the brilliant animation and delight of combining the cities of San Francisco and Tokyo to make San Franokyo, this remains a bit of a slog to get through. Baymax is a lovely character, but the plotting is so predictable that the interest remains muted. Needless to say it's a big hit and sequels will undoubtedly follow, but I for one will sign out here.\rFar superior is the accompanying short 'Feast' which is an absolute delight. With regards to this double bill, less is certainly more.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nBig Hero 6 is a heartwarming, action-packed comedy adventure film that brings the superhero trend to Disney Animation studios and they certainly hit it out of the park. It is beautifully animated, fantastically written and remembered for its delightfully charming companion robot Baymax, who is essentially the more well-versed version of Pixar’s Wall-E. The story instantly encapsulates the audience in the world of Sanfransokyo with a group of charismatic and empathetic characters, which is certainly what Disney does best.\r I was a bit disappointed with the lack of character depth for the other members of the Big Hero 6 team. Outside Hiro and Baymax the remaining four receive little screen time with each being forced into a rather archetypical mould. If Disney plans to make this the beginning of franchise, then the next instalment needs to create dynamism with the other characters or else the story will fall flat with little investment from the audience. It would also help if Honey Lemon didn’t put an accent on anything Japanese when she is caucasian and the only character who does it, but that’s just personal opinion.\r Big Hero 6 delivers an animated superhero film for all ages to enjoy. Between its entertaining characters, engaging story and witty dialogue, Baymax brings you the best medicine a healthcare robot can provide: laughter. This is definitely a movie to see in theatres whether it be with the family, couple or heck even a few friends. But be warned that your heart strings will be pulled. Just remember to fist bump them away. *Bata-lata-la*",

I understand there are some situations where Disney appropriately uses this to build character like in finding Nemo depicting some of the struggles of a single parent. There's nothing important about Hiro's lack of parents. His aunt may just as well been his mother. Why not present a more relevent reason for his lack of parents? Take Caroline for example. Although the parents are \"there\", it's only superficial because they pay no attention to her. That's a common problem many teens experience. There are also way too many secondary character sacrifices. It lost it's poignancy after a while and you knew which characters would not make it.\rOther character inconsistencies include Baymax. He's funny and charming, but he seems to be more of a cute ploy to attract viewers. I wouldn't have been suprised if he didn't exist in the original script, because he doesn't bring effect the plot as much. The villain also was a bad choice and his motivations seemed rushed. Not every villain has to be a \"suprise\".\rLastly, the here seems to be no redeeming theme of the whole film. Sure there was your usual team-work montage and the typical \"revenge is bad\" lesson, though I didn't feel as though Hiro learned anything from his trip. The work/pay-off section as well didn't really seem to teach me much either. While a theme against cutting corners was hinted, it never was tied together. There are some themes in Big Hero 6, but they are pretty typical in most kids films and aren't particularly followed through.\rIt's not a bad movie. The animation is superb as one would expect from a Disney animated film and there were a lot of laughs and fun quirks you will enjoy. Unfortunately without deep characters, motivations, or themes, the movie wasn't as memorable as I anticipated.",

Before I explain myFollowing the positive track record that Disney's animated studio has, with recent releases of Frozen and Tangled, it was easy to see why I was excited about Big Hero 6. But, that excitement was short lived. Before I explain my dissatisfaction with the movie, I will go over the positives of the film.\r Baymax is as loveable a character as any Disney has put to film, and the humor associated with him makes for quirky and intelligent dialog. The visuals are also something to behold, but I've come to expect it from Disney.  The voice actors are also well versed and expertly chosen for their individual roles.  However, not everything is done as well.\r Big Hero 6 struggles to find out what kind of movie it wants to be, and its quick shifts between emotions allow the viewer no time to grow attached to any of the characters. The movie also tries to throw a plot twist at you that is predictable and unimaginative. The plot, story and progression all seem eerily familiar, and that's because they are all copied from films of all genres.  It's cliche to the maximum and never creates its own unique identity. As it struggles to find its identity, the movie gets progressively more boring to the point of total disconnect.\r But, I can only fault BH6 so much because it is a movie targeted at a younger audience. However, comparing it to the studio's two  previous films, Frozen and Tangled; BH6 cannot hold a candle nor even a match.  Disappointing, confused and highly dramatic, I give BH6 a 5-out-of-10.",

I wish i could make this up but the only God, totally predicted this would happen (among other predictions that came to pass) and recorded the last time this happened culturally... humanity became pretty evil and God in his mercy had to destroy it in a world-wide flood to save Noah and family and all future generations born into the then (and now) unforgiving and evil world. You are told of all the nice things technology gives us but nobody considers all the terrible things we will do with it. Holographic sex doll anyone? Or if your grandpa was Hitler and someone uploaded him into the internet maybe he gets downloaded into a nice robot. My concern here is not technology itself, I believe we're just wanting it so to cheat death and keep sinning, not being accountable to God but BEING God. The wages of sin is death, and through Christ Yeshua (Jesus) you can live. But mark not my word but God's Word; we're not going to be allowed to live forever with or without technology apart from Jesus. God said \"My Spirit will not contend with man forever\" Gensesis 6:3. I'm not judging you for watching or even enjoying the movies, I just don't want people to be deceived. Your probably thinking i'm totally deceived too. That's ok but please don't hate me!  Or say i'm being \"intolerance\" and then become totally intolerant of me. But when your kid begins to hate himself because he's not as good as all the superhero's he sees in every kids show or as big as the school bully, just tell him he'll get an upgrade one day. We don't need technology near as much as we need Jesus, our moral example and creator. Don't you think that he would know what would or wouldn't make us 'better'? Anyway, i'm not trying to convert anyone, I'm completely incapable of changing anyone's beliefs no matter how much I write here, that's a matter between you and God who says, \"I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh...\" Ezekial 36:26.

It's a touching experience at the movie theater when you watch it there.\r It's beautiful and amazing when you watch it in 3-D. The sophistication of the marvel of Disney animatronics creatively crafted its ambitious scope on the Marvel comic book series of the same name and its compelling battle action scenes.\r Big Hero 6 starts at the futuristic hybrid city of San Fransokyo (a portmanteau of San Francisco and Tokyo), Hiro Hamada, a 13 year old robotics prodigy is naturally gifted when it comes in making nanotechnology and high-tech toys and stuffs. He often spends his time on robot fighting in the streets of the colorful city. But his brother Tadashi Hamada, was not impressed by this performance, he wanted Hiro to make use of his brain talent on something more creative like he was doing at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology.\r So he invite Hiro into the institute and amazed to see his brother's creation, the Baymax robot. a\rmedical robot doctor capably of helping the sick\rand the injured\r After some inspiration advantage, Hiro also wants to go into the institute like his brother do. So he invent a technology to bring it into the school fair that will admit him in the institute.\r But after the fair, a mysterious fire broke in the institute and his dreams was shattered by a horrific event that will change his life forever.\r Depressed, Baymax emerges to help his emotional state. Baymax is a cute, kind, and a marshmallow-like robot (which I describe earlier).\r Baymax is one of the primary characters here. He is basically the funniest and one of the most memorable Disney characters I have ever seen.\r But there was a contrary here on some drama animations, what makes Big Hero 6 a heartwrenching movie was the use of a rather realistic emotional love and grief, we don't actually saw it much on either Frozen or Wrech-It Ralph. You can see here how much Hiro loves his brother and his creation, Baymax. So you can sometimes call this type of animated movie a comedy-drama one.\r Also the ending is a powerful one. Unexpected, it is some sort of a brand new beginning world for Hiro and the concept of the movie itself. Don't dare to miss it!\r On the negative side, the reason why I gave it 9 stars out of 10, was it lacks the originality of some creative, inventive, and critically acclaimed animated movies. It actually copies some of the scenes of some of the past movies like How to Train Your Dragon 2 dragon training scene part. But all in all, it is compensated by something even more unique from its elements, and also for its well-scripted story. Nonetheless, Big Hero 6 will hit its target audiences contented and pleased as they go out on the theater house.\r Overall, Big Hero 6 is a terrific blast in the theaters. Its technically stunning, emotionally satisfying, entertainingly amusing, and very memorable Disney movie.\r A true Oscar runner-up in the \"Best Animated Feature\" category.\r A job well done Disney!!!\r RATING: 9 / 10",

The characters were always enjoyable and kept my interest, but it never lead to anything moreAs a comic book reader and lover, I am ashamed to say I knew next to nothing about Marvel's Big Hero 6 past a few sporadic reads here and there. The characters were always enjoyable and kept my interest, but it never lead to anything more than a mild fondness, so when I heard there would be a Big Hero 6 I can't say I was anything more than intrigued. The first Disney animated film to feature Marvel Comics characters since the acquisition in 2009, the characters seemed ripe for an animated romp onto the big screen, but detail changes to core characters left many fans holding their breath and hoping that the animation pioneers wouldn't turn their beloved characters into nothing more than second rate acts for their theme parks upon the films release. I am here to calm some of those fears and tell you that Big Hero 6 is a lot of fun!\rHiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter) is a 14 year old genius who loves robotics, so much that he's turned his passion into a career in bot fighting. Hiro's older brother Tadashi (voiced by Daniel Henney) is concerned that Hiro's talent is being wasted and tries to persuade him to attend college where he can hone his skills and hopefully achieve a successful career. Knowing nothing of the \"nerd school\" for which his brother boasts, Tadashi introduces Hiro to his classmates, Gogo (voiced by Jaime Chung), Wasabi (voiced by Damon Wayans Jr), Honey Lemon (voiced by Genesis Rodriguez), and Fred (voiced by T.J. Miller)  where Hiro begins to realize there's a lot more to this college thing than meets the eye.\rHiro meets Robert Callaghan (voiced by James Cromwell), a professor at San Fransokyo Tech who convinces Hiro to enter an admissions contest. When tragedy strikes after his acclaimed nano robotics project attracts some unwanted attention, Hiro is left scarred by the incident. The young genius detracts from his newly found friends and becomes a recluse, hiding from the talents that lead to this tragic event. But fate steps in when he least expects, Hiro discovers Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit), a kind-hearted inflatable robot built by Tadashi to serve as a healthcare companion. Soon Hiro realizes the tragic accident was more than originally thought and decides to take matters into his own hands.\rEquipping Baymax with an upgraded data package and the rest of Hiro's new friends with superhero costumes and some super cool weapons, the group begins a mission to find the villain responsible. As the group begin to get closer to a person of interest, they soon realize that Hiro is blinded by revenge in his pursuit of justice which may jeopardize the mission. Faced with the notion that the young heroes might be over their heads, will the group find a way to pull it together and bring the villain to justice or will the need for revenge derail their quest?\rBig Hero 6 offers amazing visuals and mixes the gritty tone of Japanese anime with modern American concepts. Directors Don Hall and Chris Williams create a truly enjoyable world and find a wonderful balance for their audience which doesn't discount the source content, but also allows for these characters to find discovery from a new generation. While the film does at times feel very cookie cutter in its telling, it doesn't detract from the overall experience.\r Overall, Big Hero 6 is big fun for the whole family with characters that will no doubt find their place amongst your children's favorites for years to come. Comic book fans rest assured, your beloved BH6 have been well looked after, even if Baymax looks more like the stay puft marshmallow man than an ass kicking machine. Pick your battles people..it's still a lot of fun!",

It is a little bit transformeric and Bayish-style by starting off with some familiar scenes in \"Real Steel\" and having electronic pop-rock style scores from the composer Henry Jackman. However, setting in a background of American-Japanese culture might lead to the thought of targeting Japan's market after enormous profit from there, but this adorable, kind-hearted, friendly robot Baymax reminds us of good moral values, and certainly, it will easily be one of the most loveable character among the audiences.",

Man of Action did a lot of the character work, and they are best known for Ben 10 and Generator Rex, two children's shows with focus mainly on action.  Neither show had a strong non-violent message.

All of this is achievable by the presence of a protagonist that allows to audience to identify with, a lovable/charismatic companion and a parade of eccentric friends.

The first 30-40 minutes are among the best I've seen in a children's movie, and they are the only point at which the movie's cliches and recycled visuals and story do not undermine the appeal and humor of the movie. The editing, pacing, and humor complement the narrative perfectly, but the film gradually loses its inventiveness that I hoped so badly would persist throughout, and it became something we've all seen before. It feels like the villain and main characters never got the chance to develop past a one sentence description of their quirks and motivations, making Hiro's character arc something that seems rushed and shallow.\r However, I thoroughly enjoyed what the film offered as a strongly \"Disney\" movie, one which utilizes a brilliant blend of visuals and lighthearted humor to create an entirely unique experience. It doesn't strive to create something complex or intellectually endearing, so its failure to avoid tiresome cliches and a predictable twist and conclusion fall by the wayside to its success as a visual and emotional feast that continues to stick with me.",

Visually engaging, the movie is easily accessible and will entertain general audience. Its many heartfelt moments as well as genuine comedy elevate the movie into the caliber of Disney's greats. The plot moves fast as it shows a lighter take on superhero formula, it never presses too much or heavy handed on its approach. While Disney is always known to showcase visual in fantasy setting, it's nice to see the vista changes to modern city of San Fransokyo, as the name suggests, an oriental version of San Fransisco.\r For those who have been exposed to horde of superhero movies of recent time, it's easy to see how the plot moves, especially as an origin story. Big Hero 6 makes the expected journey fun with plenty of humor, mostly fat jokes in expense of Baymax, the inflatable marshmallow robot. Viewer might predict the story, but still amused nonetheless. The assembly of the team deserves a credit for introducing many characters, presentable enough to be memorable but still delicately manages to produce a sense of camaraderie. Unlike many superheroes who have the luxury of a full movie or series, these guys must share the spotlight, yet they're all feel pretty welcomed in their own quirky ways.\r Graphic-wise the animation is great. While there are other mediums with more realistic visual, the movie delivers action in just the right balanced tone of fantasy and modern contemporer. It's definitely vibrant with colors, design is impeccable, and the movement looks comically organic. Disney has reached the point where it can dazzle with 3D the same as it did decades ago with hand drawn picture and still moves audience with heartfelt story.\r Despite all the action and flair, Big Hero 6 is centered on friendship. It's easily enjoyable as anyone will find something to relate and be thoroughly delighted.",

Sorry but I want it to be characterized as a poor boy who has lost everything?\rAlso good characterization of the secondary characters, from tender Baymax, who with his ingenuity by robots will reflect the same Hiro on the choices of his life, Hiro's nerd friends, which will help to catch the man with the mask which kabuki stole his microbot, the amiable aunt Cass.\rToo bad for the fall style with the ultimate sacrifice of Baymax (for charity, definitely exciting and intense, but foregone) and the unveiling of 'identity of the man with the mask, under which lurked prof. Callaghan.\rAlthough this choice is not entirely wrong, because they actually are the clues that gives the film to assume that there is him under the mask, but it is the reason why steals microbot and becomes a sort of super villain (I must admit, very well developed aesthetically) that fails to fully convince.\rProbably, without these defects that, in spite of myself, I could not stand up, I would have considered \"Big Hero 6\" a masterpiece in every respect.\rFor the rest of the fun is guaranteed, the rhythm flows perfectly and the characters will entertain you but also warm your heart.",

It's a heartwarming story about a nurse/doctor robot that would do anything to keep his master safe. Made by the people at Walt Disney Studios (actually people from Pixar Studios).\r Cons: 1. Could have been great if it had not looked like a lazy rip off of The Incredibles by the same Pixar people who made The Incredibles.\r More: If Jobs was around, he would not have allowed this to be made or if he had come aboard after the film had been made, he would have demanded major re-animations or just canning of the whole film.\r Score: 3/5 (no half scores). Watch it on TV only.",

The story takes place in the future following Hiro, a robotics prodigy in the city of San Fransokyo as he goes about his life with his older brother Tadashi and their group of friends. This time around the ultimate disney hero is provided for those who enjoy the cute and squishy, the ever so huggable and inflatable medical robot Tadashi created named Baymax. The very image of Baymax in some of the trailers probably drew in the entire population of those under the age of 8. There are some dark events that leads everyone to come together as a team and essentially be a Disney movie, but all in all, as with How to Train Your Dragon 2. Disney has created another great animated action comedy that will bring a smile to pretty much anyone's face. Unless you work in a puppy mill, then you just shouldn’t be smiling.\rAnywho, great movie to watch for those who, like myself, enjoy the creations of Disney.",

Big Hero 6 is moving, entertaining and although not a classic, will hold up well.\rThe Jimmy Neutron meets the love child of WALL-E and EVE plot has moments of darkness kids films tend to avoid. Its also wonderfully animated and full of detail and touches that dazzle the eye, right up to the last act of good guys vs. bad guy battle that is a bit jarring and out of place.\rVerdict: Watch",

It's just a compilation of superhero movie cliches-uck. I think that the atmosphere of the movie was nice, though, and the mash up of Tokyo and San Francisco as its setting is really cool. The only thing I actually really enjoyed was Baymax. The movie was funny in some parts, and Baymax is a pretty interesting and creative character. However, if Baymax didn't exist, this movie would be pretty bad. 2.5-3 stars bad. I'd say if you have kids, this wouldn't be THAT much torture to watch. It isn't a bad movie, but it isn't very good by Disney standards either. If you REALLY want to watch it, knock yourself out, but if you aren't really sure or you don't think that you'll be very interested in the movie, save the money for another one.",
