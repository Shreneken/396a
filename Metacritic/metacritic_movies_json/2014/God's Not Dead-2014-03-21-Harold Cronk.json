Radisson begins class by informing students that they will need to disavow, in writing, the existence of God on that first day, or face a failing grade. As other students in the class begin scribbling the words “God Is Dead” on pieces of paper as instructed, Josh find himself at a crossroads, having to choose between his faith and his future. Josh offers a nervous refusal, provoking an irate reaction from his smug professor. Radisson assigns him a daunting task: if Josh will not admit that “God Is Dead,” he must prove God’s existence by presenting well-researched, intellectual arguments and evidence over the course of the semester, and engage Radisson in a head-to-head debate in front of the class. If Josh fails to convince his classmates of God’s existence, he will fail the course and hinder his lofty academic goals. With almost no one in his corner, Josh wonders if he can really fight for what he believes. Can he actually prove the existence of God? Wouldn’t it just be easier just to write “God Is Dead” and put the whole incident behind him?… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The film has entertaining moments, but these are clearly secondary to its proselytizing intentions.",
    "The pace is stumbling, the characters are broad, the makeup and the performances uneven, though Sorbo dives into his tactless, unethical indoctrinator role with Satanic glee.",
    "Ban this sick filth.",
    "Even grading on a generous curve, this strident melodrama about the insidious efforts of America’s university system to silence true believers on campus is about as subtle as a stack of Bibles falling on your head.",
    "Even by the rather lax standards of the Christian film industry, God’s Not Dead is a disaster.",
    "Any just God would likely recoil from the ham-fisted and spurious defense put forth in this film."

Every atheist is depicted as an arrogant jerk (yes some atheist are arrogant jerks and I was an arrogant jerk back when I first started being an atheist but I mellowed out some and I accept Christianity as a thing in our world and most atheists are nice people) who's out to destroy god and take away God because the big bad atheists don't want people praying because it's illogical. Also the arguments \"presented\" are so ridiculously asinine that any competent atheists (as in a atheist who studied up on common arguments against gods existence) could debunk them in their sleep.\rNow just when it couldn't get any worse, they introduce a Muslim girl who's rebelling against her uber strict Quran thumping father by listening to the Holy word of god all mighty. When he finds out that her little hijab wearing angel is listening to sermons and won't accept Islam as the true faith. He beats her like a Mexican pinata and throws her out the house by her neck, clumping atheists together with Muslims as another group that has to be lampooned in this **** **** of a movie.\rBut believe it or not this isn't even the worst part about this movie, it's the ending, oh dear god the ending. I'm going to spoil the ending of this movie because **** this movie, **** the people who made this movie, **** the people who bought tickets to this movie (I bought a ticket to another movie called the Grand Budapest Hotel and snuck in the theater where the film was playing so I wouldn't pay money to the creators), and while I got my **** yous out **** the people who served me cold crabcakes at TGI Fridays 2 days ago. At the end of the movie the antagonistic philosophy professor losses the debate against the generic white boy christian named Josh Wheaton (Not to be confused with Joss Wheadon) and on his way to meet his wife who broke up with him for being an atheist (I share your pain you philosophy professor even if you managed to lose the debate to someone you shouldn't have in a realistic situation) then he gets hit by a car. Now as he's dying with blood filling his longs a pastor comes in and after getting the crowd to call an ambulance, he basically forces him to convert to god by using his last minutes of waking breath to get him to accept Jesus implying that at in the end all atheist will eventually accept Jesus once they're near death which sort of offends me. It's Pascals Wager (look it up) in all but name which implies that it doesn't matter whether or not you've spent your entire life disbelieving as long as you accept Jesus before you die you'll be saved which also implies that God's morality is incredibly shallow but I'm not hear to provoke a debate I'm her to criticize an awful movie. It's basically saying \"Hah, you may have all the facts but once you're near death you'll see who's right.\" in a condescending tone.\rThis film isn't just bad, it's offensively bad. It's Birth of a Nation with the atheists being substituted for African Americans (not in plot but in intent). And the punch line was I was looking for a good arguments in this film but instead I found my non-belief system being viciously skewed in order to spread some half baked Christian propaganda. It offers no new arguments I haven't heard, portrays the non-Christians as arrogant dickwads, and it made way more money than it deserved to make. Don't see this movie if you're looking for a fair view of Atheists, or even if you're looking for arguments against Atheism, because this film won't provide any thing of value for you.",

Seriously tho, this is sickening propaganda. It literally switches the role of Christians with anyone else and tries to make it seem as if they are somehow a super minority that is bullied by everyone else. Worst off is that the film tries to give a few cases where such a thing has happened to Christians, but apparently they thought everyone watching this would be far too stupid to fact check, because for anyone who does, you'll find that none of the cases listed actually has anything to do with what happened to the main character in the film. In fact, most of the example cases they gave actually revolve around Christians trying to gain privileges over other groups within schools. It doesn't matter what religion you follow, if any...

TheI give this movie a mixed  (solid 5) review because it generally does nothing for either group: Christian theists or non-believers/skeptics.\r To the Christians: Congratulations, you have a movie which is unapologetic in its views. The problem is that anyone who is actually a fence sitter and does more than drool in a corner all day will move towards non-belief after a movie like this. The best way to change the minds of people involves something called \"addressing their concerns\". This movie does not do that. It basically presents non-believers as bitter, depressed people who have a priori an anti-God/Jesus/FSM agenda.  So you may enjoy it to \"rally the troops\" but all it does is antagonize everyone else with a severe case of anti-intellectualism.\r To atheists/skeptics/agnostics: Okay, so you know that the movie is basically like Blizzcon for WoW fans: an unabashed celebration of something they love without mercy to the competition. And you have yet another checkmark on the list of terrible Christian movies out there that preach to the choir. But this is nothing new: the only risk here is more indoctrination of Sally and Johnny (8 and 10 respectively) who come to school with more bravado than ever...literally more willing to fight because it feels more like a 3 on 1 curbstomping. It does nothing to advance the discussion: it reverses it and revives old-school \"Why do you hate God so much???\" proselytizing.",

As you can see from the vast majority ofIt's a movie made by christians with the hopes to not only entertain fellow christians, but also spread the message and love of Jesus to nonbelievers. Basically the standard of any christian film. As you can see from the vast majority of reviews on here it doesn't do a good job of drawing in nonbelievers, and will offend all but the most open-minded of them.\r This has to do with the way the non-believing characters are portrayed. It paints atheists and other nonbelievers as just bad people, who do nothing but hurt those who are christians, whether they be family or strangers, and constantly try to get them to deny their faith. I get that there are people like that in the world, but the movie doesn't show that there are those who are tolerant of it. Instead painting every non-christian as that. It will offend non-believers for that, and not because of it's message that \"God's not dead.\"\r As far as things like acting and plotting go it's not too bad, but could be better. Outside of a select few (basically just the main two characters) the acting could be better. The main plot is very well done, but is surrounded by a few lackluster sub-plots that really just feel like unnecessary intrusions that break up the flow of the movie. To make matters worse only a few pay off in the end. Still the main plot delivers and, outside of the previously mentioned way of how it portrays non-christians, it won't (or rather shouldn't) offend with it's message.\r Watching the back and forth between the teacher and student is actually quite entertaining. The movie manages to make a compelling argument for why \"God's not dead,\" and it does so without shoving religious belief down the throats of the non-believing audience. It more or less shows why people follow the christian faith and believe in God, gives a strong argument for why it's right, and tells you to do with that what you will. It's pretty impressive stuff that doesn't come off as preachy.\r So at the end of the day the movie isn't perfect, but for christians it will be one empowering film that any non-believer should see. For non-christians it has the potential to offend quite a bit, but if they are willing to accept that it's portrayal of non-christians is flawed, and solely just watch it to see why christians believe the way they do, then they may find an eye opening film. One that might not get them more interested in learning more about Jesus, but will at lest show them that christians aren't lunatics for their faith. My total score for the movie is a 7.5/10.",

First, I need to say as a university faculty member and a Christian, I deeply believe in the overall MESSAGE of this movie: The God of Abraham and Paul and Mother Teresa and Pope Francis and MY God, and his son Jesus Christ are alive and instructing and blessing me daily. People do need to know about the resource and comfort and \"rock\" that God provides. For that the movie gets an \"A.\" And I'd also say that although there are strident Christians who misuse the public square for hateful messages, there IS an attempt in the secular community, and certainly in the academy, to marginalize Christians. Faculty members do use their power in the classroom to try to silence opinions with which they disagree in a violation of BOTH sections of the first amendment.\r That said, the movie itself was not very realistic. A professor giving a student twenty minutes in each of three classes to make the case for God and putting it to a class vote? Come on. I can see how a Christian kid who'd been abused in a secular professor's classroom would fantasize bout such a thing, but it ain't gonna happen.\r The Pure Flix movies tend to follow this pattern--sincere but not especially well done. I like Sherwood Pictures (Fireproof, Courageous) better and will continue to support Christian movies as they evolve and get better. The Christian movie genre is still in its infancy and deserves an chance to improve.\r So \"A\" for effort and overall message, but, with regret, \"D\" for everything else.",

While God’s Not Dead may not automatically grab your attention as a summer blockbuster, it is good enough to keep your attention unlike the multitude of old Christian B movies out there and shows that this genre really is starting to mature. I really liked the deviation from being a pure philosophical discussion to talking about science and showing how the Bible supports true science, even the Big Bang and Evolution without wasting time alluding to young earth creationist pseudoscientific arguments that so many well-meaning Christians think they need believe in that pseudoscience to be true believers of sacred scripture. If only the pastor of my church, Rock Church in San Diego, would realize this and stick to what the Bible says instead of engaging in spurious young earth creationist arguments and getting himself tied up with personal interpretations of the Bible that the creators of this film have deftly avoided. This is all while creating a film that promotes the core of the Christian message from a scientific viewpoint that engages both physical and spiritual reality for those who believe or are about ready to believe in the one that says no matter what happens in your life and how much you lose, you are not an orphan but a child of God, if you will only believe in me. Don’t choose God or Science, watch the movie and maybe you will find a way to choose both.",

It DOES happen. I wish there were Christian lobbying and legal groups who would have been there to defend me against some of those types during my own young naive Christian years.\rCollege professors can also abuse their power in other ways (usually sexual harassment, etc.) and it's just a given that students should be protected from that. Nobody questions it.\rThat being said, I was never some preachy self-righteous Bible-quoting sheep. I was a curious kid from a Christian home who would eventually drop my faith, but certainly NOT because I was bullied for it. I dropped my Christian faith after reading books by Richard Dawkins, Bertrand Russell and Robert Ingersoll (still my personal favorite). But I read those books on my own free time, because I was curious. None of the bully atheist professors even mentioned any of these authors to me. I sure wish they had. Bully professors only want to hurt their students, not educate them. I became an arrogant atheist myself for a few years, and I can't say I was truly trying to educate people during that time either. But the atheist books made me feel free of religious superstition. Most of my hostility towards believers came from my having gone so long myself, feeling trapped by that.\rEventually I realized that faith in an afterlife is probably pretty important in a world that has to deal with death of family members & loved ones. It helps them cope. You know this better when you've experienced it. And belief in a deity is -sadly- also necessary in a world where most people don't just naturally have a high ethical self-standard without it.\rWhile ethics are certainly possible without a god, and civilized behavior, there are few who truly are ethical and civilized without needing some ultimate reward for it, so as best to follow after death. Religion is not all bad. To anyone who thinks we'd have a better world without it, I say: not everyone is intellectually equipped to handle it. If you think religious people are scary when they have a religion, take that religion away, and I guarantee many of them would only get worse.\rSome scenes I could *really* do without: cut out the Duck Dynasty crap. There's is not star power the movie needed, and it would have done much better without. Even when I was a Christian, I would have found it icky & distasteful; these people speaking for me.\rThe Newsboys advertising was a bit too heavy as well. Just a poster here, and a concert there is enough. The atheist professor did not need to die in the end for the message to be uplifting. I think having him convert in frantic desperation, while dying, struck a lot of people as cliche and heavy-handed.\rThe Muslim dysfunction was very uncomfortable to watch, but here in America, we are loaded with news articles telling us of far worse behavior done in the name of that religion. If it's true, it ain't slander. There was no acid thrown into anyone's faces, nobody's nose got cut off, no honor killings, no suicide bombings, no stonings, no burqa bombs. So yes; it was very uncomfortable, but still tame compared to what the mainstream news reports give us.\rAs for the philosophical debate; good effort. I'd have liked to see the Christian's arguments be just a little stronger, and I'd have also preferred the atheist professor base his position on logic rather than sordid emotion, but I get that it's a feel-good Christian-happy flick, not a religious nor political documentary. I will cut it some slack. It wasn't as laughably emotional as The Mormon Proposition when reporting relies heavily on crazy wild rumors & off-the-wall schmulz, bordering on deliberate misinfo, but the movie risks coming quite close.\rI liked most of the movie but wish I could cut entire scenes out, but if you're an atheist like me and you don't like being preached at, give this film a chance anyway. I didn't feel TOO preached at.",

My husband isn't a militant atheist like most of the bad reviewers on here, he just doesn't believe in going to church.  This film is for Christians and people seeking without hostility.\r A few hostile reviewers claimed that the scenario is so unbelievable.  They are out of touch.  I've heard of numerous true stories about Christians being hassled by professors in college.  In fact there is a great book called \"The Insanity of Unbelief: A Journalist's Journey from Belief to Skepticism to Deep Faith\" In which the author, investigative journalist Max Davis, explains a similar encounter with a professor humiliating him in front of the class for being a believer.\r Christianity is the one religion that it's okay for everyone else to attack.  There are constant portrayals of  \"Bad Christians\" in thousands of movies out of Hollywood and some people freak out when there are a handful of Christian films to counter act them without the same huge budgets and star power.  It's very reveling really.  These people as well as some of the reviewers are acting just like the professor in the film.\r Sure the movie is slanted and some of the Characters are one dimensional,  it's supposed to be that way just like the thousands and thousands of anti-Christian films are.  This film is a great response to all those anti-Christian films and if you're interested in some counter arguments, then it's a great film.  If not, go back to the multitude a of anti-Christian films and hate on those for being biased against Christians if fair and balanced is what you demand from every film.",

Just more propaganda to hate other religions and races. This is coming from an agnostic that wants peace in the world which I see not coming since propaganda like this is coming out. Also makes Atheists look like stubborn selfish people who \"hate\" God and believe in him only because they feel they have had injustice in their life. Also it makes Christians look like bullies always having to be right about everything. I don't know why many church people expect all Professors as being Atheist. Most of my Professors I have had are Christian, and I remember when I was raised in the church they told me when I got in college Professors would try making me Atheist (which wasn't the case at all) Professors are and should always be bias to what they teach.

He's really good at drawing empathy for a bitter intellectual. He brings nihilism to life when quoting Job and Shakespeare. And with his command over his role, he almost makes it believable that his character can away with what he gets away with.- The pacing and build-up to the climax, true to the form of a David and Goliath story. I always felt engaged, and each scene came when it felt like it should come.- Despite the enormous cast for a short movie, all of the characters are distinct and memorable. By \"memorable\" I don't mean \"interesting\"; I just mean \"when I see their face, I remember who they are and why they're important\".What I didn't like:- The unbelievability of it all. Several characters make decisions, and several situations exist, simply because the plot needs it to be that way. Small example: the way the main character's girlfriend of 6 years breaks up with him over his choice to debate the professor. I can't see why she in her right mind would do that. But the movie needs it to be that way to show that Christians are persecuted and alienated for confessing Christ.- There's almost no moral nuance in any character. It's totally black-and-white; all the Christian characters are good and all the non-Christian characters are bad. The non-Christians never make a good point that's taken seriously, and the Christians never say or do anything questionable in the name of their religion. Everyone is defined by the side that they take, not by their individual desires or demons.- There were a few scenes that were supposed to be dramatic or tragic, but in the moment, the characters turned into mouthpieces for doctrine. They made me giggle because of how ridiculously out-of-place their words were. This is when the movie became \"so bad it's good\".- There are so many subplots that some of them don't have the time they would need to be developed in a way that makes sense. It's less a story and more a bunch of tenuously connected stuff that happens.- It's shallow. If there's any real moral of the story, it's that the love of Jesus brings people together. And it brings them together at a Newsboys concert. Nevermind their trauma and dire circumstances. Just pay to go watch people perform on stage and it will all be better.- And finally: its thesis is unconvincing. The movie basically sidesteps the issue of whether or not God actually exists, and just focuses on the power of the cultural phenomenon of Christianity. And the persecution it supposedly faces. The characters who *are* converted are converted way too easily, and the persecutors are obvious straw men. The movie has little verisimilitude. It's not a story about humans doing human things and going through human changes. It's propaganda.",

It provides a rather accurate portrayal of \"evangelical atheism,\" whose followers are not simply content with their own belief in the nonexistence of God but who frequently elevate themselves above others – often using scare tactics, demeaning language, and any other harsh means necessary – to try to make as many others as possible join them in their campaign against God. It vividly depicts individuals who sincerely desire to inquire into the truth of their Maker and His provisions and purpose for them, at the risk of losing the support of their family, friends, and other loved ones, who do not know Him and want nothing to do with Him. It even shows those who are confronted with their own imminent deaths, in the face of which they are finally willing to seek out the God whom they denied for most of their lives.I did enjoy a lot of the specific topics that were brought up in the classroom with the Christian student who was willing to take a stand against the evangelical atheistic professor. These debates allowed the movie watcher to consider the fact that many who feel that science has \"proven\" that there is no God are simply placing their trust in those who are regarded as experts in the field, so they put their faith in the notion that some scientist, or combination of scientists, out there has all the answers and can explain all of existence, without there being any need for a master designer. The movie makes the truth of the matter very clear, however, for no scientist to date has ever received credit for having fully explained how absolutely everything, including time itself, could have sprung from absolutely nothing, not to mention how that which is nonliving, regardless of how it originally came into existence, could have ever developed into something that is living, without the aid of an intelligent agent. The movie brought home the point that certain statements made by prominent scientists in this regard have been shown to fall victim to circular reasoning.I do wish, however, that the movie would have spent more time focusing on the historical figure known as Jesus Christ. Some of the debates in the classroom could have addressed the fact that even the biggest of skeptics and critics, who have performed extensive research into Jesus of Nazareth, have had to admit that he was an actual man who walked the earth around 2,000 years ago, who became nailed to a cross, who appeared to have died as a result of it, and was actually buried, and afterwards was seen alive again by many, who were so convinced that He had truly risen from the dead that they were willing to sacrifice their own lives to proclaim Him to others, with the hope that others would realize their need to trust in His death and resurrection, in order to receive the forgiveness of all of their sins, ensuring that they will one day be with Him – along with all others who put their faith and trust in Him in this life – in Heaven once this life is over. Sadly, the movie did not spend a whole lot of time explaining Jesus as the historical figure that He truly is, but it did nevertheless make it clear that there is an urgent need for everyone to trust in Him to be saved, while touching on the danger that is waiting in eternity for those who do not.",

This, while an interesting premise, does not in any way come into fruition. Instead 'God's Not Dead' is a movie which serves as an insult to philosophy. Even the basic argument \"God is dead.\" is a misinterpretation of Friedrich Nietzsche's well-known phrase, which refers to God not being held in much of any regard within the culture and society rather than questioning his existence.\r The movie displays atheists as simply 'closet Christians who are angry at God', and does nothing to acknowledge the varying faiths and differences in the interpretation of the existence of a god, and instead opts to solely focus on the Christian God. Furthermore, anyone who is not a Christian is displayed as being an unpleasant person to deal with, to say the least, with the only Muslims being displayed being portrayed as physically abusive and oppressive. The arguments, of both the student and the professor, within the film, when they are even present,  are based on such logical fallacies as strawman, argument from ignorance and ad hominem, to name a few.\r Of all of the few minutes dedicated to the actual arguments on the subject of the existence of the Christian deity, there is no form of compelling discussion on the topic, and the focus of the argument is reduced to a few quotes from scientists (instead of philosophers) and one rant on the topic. The potential time for any form of compelling argument was instead used to focus on numerous side stories which served to contribute little to the story. So much time is spent on these side stories, which are unrelated to the main character and the central plot, that there is little to no development for the numerous characters introduced in them, and as a result all the characters are dry with little to no depth to them. The only contribution to the story from these storylines is to contribute to a rushed and cliche ending involving Christianity triumphing over the 'evil, secular institution'.\r Overall the movie is a disappointment on what could have been an interesting take on the centuries-long issue of the existence of a god in philosophy. Instead the movie serves only as a feel-good movie for those Christians who want to see a movie with Christianity 'winning' against secularism, and who do not care about that movie having any real argument, character development or quality writing.\r In short, the movie performs poorly in terms of its quality as a movie, and is even worse in terms of its stated purpose. I found the movie to be barely watchable, and would not recommend it instead of a recommendation on what not to do when addressing this topic.",

Well-acted, produced and directed per normal Hollywood standards, I thought. Engaging from start to finish. I was not fidgety in my seat.\r The movie was not just the debate. There was drama. If you are a father or daughter, especially from an Asian culture, and even if you are of Western origin, there is a moment in the movie when you will be moved with a surge of simultaneous emotions (intense sadness, compassion, suspense, hope, etc.), so much so that there is lump in my throat and tears in my eyes as I write this. I can still see the torment on the father's face (an actor whom I have never seen before) and the daughter's anguish.\r I would see this movie again if only to see that part again.\r The debate is only about 20-25 percent of the movie. There is a bunch of other situations involving relationships, conflicts and life choices we all make, all smoothly and engagingly woven into the main storyline that moves at a very good pace.\r For Christians in the habit of watching faith programs, studying the Bible, reading faith books and regularly attending church and Sunday school there won't be much new in the debate. Nominal Christians and non-Christians who are intellectually honest will find the debate interesting, enlightening, even persuasive, and a couple of unexpected twists in the story captivating.\r I had never heard a particular Steven Hawking assertion (not mentioning it here because I don't want to spoil the movie for you) which the Christian student uses in the debate. There may be things like that many may not have read or heard before.\r What should have struck me long before the movie is how atheists and progressives tend to fast-talk their arguments (apparently to impress the common man with their intellectual superiority by attempting to prevent the man's brain from catching up with what they are saying) while believers and conservatives tend to be slow and deliberative in what they say because they want people to truly understand what they are writing and saying.\r Reminds me of a math major roommate I had in the Army who sent a girl a letter with the stamp deliberately affixed to the envelope upside down. He explained to me that the upside down stamp usually is a coded or subconscious message that the sender has romantic interest in the receiver. When the girl took the bait he went through this [faulty] probability reasoning to impress her, \"proving\" that the stamp was upside down merely by dumb chance.\r I believe it will be well worth the time and money you spend on this movie. I hope you won't miss it. If you are a Christian it will help you help others. If you are not a Christian I believe it will indeed entertain you at a minimum or change your life in a way you now think is impossible.",

The point of this movie is to show man the error of his way and the need for a Savior/God.  There are 2 paths in this life: 1.) The straight and narrow path which leads to eternal life/Heaven through Jesus Christ.  2.) The crooked and broad path that leads to death/Hell through unbelief and rejection of Jesus the Christ.  If you are tired of seeing movies with the one sided view that there is no God…man comes from monkeys…who evolved from some single celled organism or some green slime, then see this movie with an open heart and an ear to hear.

This movie is about a college kid, who in some cases don't even acknowledge God, who is being challenged by his teacher to prove Gods not dead. The teacher calls himself atheist because he said he \"didn't think God existed\" when in fact he did believe in God, he just hated him for taking his mom at an early age. Things like this can really happen.\r Also, not all philosophy teachers are like this. Even the guy at the beginning of the movie who was looking over the main characters schedule and saw that he had a cross necklace on told him that he'd suggest he pick ANOTHER TEACHER in the same dept. So no, I don't believe it makes philosophers look bad.\r Does this movie make atheist look bad? Probably, I'm obviously Christian but I've had a few discussions with atheist on facebook who say they don't even believe in God so how could they hate him. Well, yes since that's true it could make someone think all atheist are like that professor. That's why you have to go into the movie with an open mind, not criticise it. Yes I'm a Christian so yes I like it.\r The main gist was this: a kid stood up for what he believed in and proved to his teacher that Gods not dead and won his whole class over. This could happen anywhere. I think all the critics already have their mind made up that they don't like the movie only because they don't believe. And as for those who claim theyre Christian, you're reading too far. If you believe in God and Jesus Christ and have a relationship with him, he will provide. He will protect and he'll always be there.\r And I'm sorry for those who don't agree with me.",

Firstly, this is without a doubt the most cynical, ridiculous \"movie\" I've ever seen. I watched this after hearing how amazing it was from religious friends of the family and family members.

It seemed forced really.\r2) The professor attacks the student personally (who would do that) and completely invalidates his points. Even in high school debate or discussions, they teach you a personal attack without relevance is just about the worst thing you could do. 3) Most surprising was the \"rental car\" fiasco that keeps appearing throughout with the youth minister. Why not just rent from a different company or take a cab? Hilarious.\rAbout half-way through I noticed where everything was going and began to try note where the unrealistic points/ideas/situations were present (maybe that's the intent by the director?). I almost got to the point of saying \"Leave boy! Leave the school because it's ridiculous! Leave the girl because she's insane! File a report against the professor for a personal attack!\" (See a theme here?)\rIn summary, rent if you want a good laugh. Although some valid points are made (don't follow like sheep, stand for your beliefs), the way they were presented and challenged were laughable (see above).
