But this prince, Hercules, knows nothing of his real identity or his destiny. He desires only one thing: the love of Hebe, Princess of Crete, who has been promised to his own brother. When Hercules learns of his greater purpose, he must choose: to flee with his true love or to fulfill his destiny and become the true hero of his time.… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "There's a fun retro camp to Hercules, with nods to classics such as Ben-Hur and Spartacus, as Hercules finds himself rowing slave ships and crossing desert expanses.",
    "The action comes thick and fast but the storyline is generic and Lutz makes a particularly dull hero. An Erymanthian bore.",
    "Renny Harlin's Legend of Hercules fulfills every silly, flimsy promise that it makes in the first place: There are lots of battles (albeit rather jerkily rendered ones), some grand-looking horses decked out in handsome metal headdresses, and lots of well-oiled beefcake.",
    "This movie, with its relatively modest running time and not-quite-household-name cast, is no more ridiculous than, let’s say, the “Thor” movies, and a lot less pretentious.",
    "Like so many of today’s action films, The Legend of Hercules is too busy peddling slick, stone-faced portent to ever bother making us laugh, or engaging us in any way.",
    "While the art of action filmmaking depreciates, Harlin remains steadfast in his classicism, even if the movie doesn’t have the foundation to support him.",
    "While Lutz might possess the beefcake to fill out his chest armor, he lacks the acting chops to make us much care about the fate of his gleaming hero who looks as if he just stepped out of a Beverly Hills salon.",
    "Given its virtuous subject matter and the relative bloodlessness of its violence, perhaps Renny Harlin means for this film to be a means of atoning for his previous cinematic sins.",
    "At times, with its stiff, charisma-impaired cast, its digital sets and slo-mo slaughter, The Legend of Hercules has a whiff of the Augean Stables about it — if you catch my drift.",
    "Lutz’s acting muscles aren’t nearly as well developed as his pectorals and deltoids, and while the role may not call for a master thespian, it at least begs someone who can emote without looking like he’s straining to execute a dead lift.",
    "While The Legend Of Hercules offers plenty for viewers who’ve acquired a taste for the fake and incompetent (not the least of which is the dialogue, which finds characters saying each other’s names at the end of every other sentence), it’s unlikely to please anyone who wants entertainment in the conventional sense.",
    "While watching it, I kept thinking this was like \"47 Ronin,\" in which an unfortunate novice director was given a project way out of his or her reach. In no way was I prepared to learn it was the work of veteran Harlin.",
    "If you admire Kellan Lutz's chiseled body, The Legend of Hercules does offer plenty of that in 3-D glory.",
    "Where 300 made a virtue of its low budget by stripping the visuals down to their essential elements, the shot-in-Bulgaria Legend Of Hercules mostly just looks rushed and cheap, only coming to life in a handful of fight scenes, and then only briefly.",
    "If The Legend of Hercules were just a little more inept or over-the-top, it might have been ridiculous fun. As it is, unfortunately, Harlin embraces the mediocrity of the screenplay with a dour straight face, draining it of any enjoyably camp possibilities.",
    "A movie so ugly and woeful that you'll wish you had superhuman strength to pluck your own eyeballs out of your head.",
    "The only thing epic about The Legend of Hercules is what a failure it is.",
    "The whole thing is a total bore; even the supporting players aren’t motivated enough to attract attention. That’s good news for Lutz; he can’t be blamed for torpedoing the project, because everyone is doing subpar work here.",
    "This ludicrously written, buffoonishly acted, irritatingly filmed sword-and-sandals epic hasn't half the sand, sweat or saltiness of other titles in the genre."

Hercules suddenly teleports from a boat to a desert and from a desert to a \"fighting.....place?\"\r The plot is basically nonexistent, the movie consists of Hercules going from bloodless battle to bloodless battle and doggy paddling across a shocking number of bodies of water(They could have at least got an actor who could swim)\r At the end of the movie Hebe, the generic love interest, stabs a dagger through her shoulder and into Hercules' brother, she somehow survives for long enough to say her final words, while the brother is dead instantly. Then suddenly the scene changes and you can hear a crying baby. The camera zooms in and Hebe is holding it. It literally never explained how this happened. NEVER! You can't just have somebody die and then show them alive in the next scene, that makes no sense!\r This movie is overall on atrocity.

Also they must have run out of ideas with the Gladiator remake portion where they fight for their freedom. The guy who played Hercules has no acting skills and it shows. They just found some guy with a good body and handed him a script it seems. Just overall really poor. Also, the ending scene was incredibly stupid.

Probably the worst thing about the movie is that it hard to support Kellan Lutz as Hercules. His performance is lacking, and constantly watching him make stupid faces during the action scenes is agonizing. Lutz isn't the only offender when it comes to bad acting, almost the entire cast sucks. Liam McIntyre gives the only respectable performance, and it's great to see the Spartacus star step back onto the arena sands. Shame about that bowl haircut though.\r While the performances range from lacking to just plain bad, the action is mostly decent. Granted there are countless movies that have done it better, and without constantly having characters goofily being thrown through the air in slow motion, but it's at least watchable. The action scenes are a constant form of unintentional comedic gold. One scene involving a lightning whip is particularly amusing. The action is the only enjoyable part of the film, but entirely for the wrong reasons.\r This is clearly just one huge b-movie. With Lutz failing to make a compelling Hercules in any way, the whole film noticeably suffers more than I feel it otherwise would have. Yes, it would have still suffered from the poor plot and bad acting from the rest of the cast, but had they at least found a half-decent person to play Hercules then maybe there would have at least been reason to overlook a lot of it's flaws and maybe even care about the romance at the center of this film. As it stands now I recommend you skip this one and hope that Dwayne Johnson's upcoming Hercules movie is better later this year. My total score for the film is a 4.2/10=Bad.",

Unless it features a Game of Thrones star, I ain't going to pay $10 bucks to watch another Hercules rip-off. I've watched a lot of Hercules way back in the 90's including the Disney version and Hercules: The Legendary Journeys staring the great Kevin Sorbo. How many updated versions of Hercules will they last? I don't know but Hollywood should just keep the Hercules to rest already. The Legend of Hercules features a terrible action hero who really can't act as Hercules, an dimwitted script, funny CGI elements, bland source material, and sometimes even Renny Harlin's Cutthroat Island is still a flop, maybe this one could add to his list of bad movies. He's a great director but needs to bring back Geena Davis and finally make some action movies together. If anyone buying a copy of the movie, please seek therapy. Bottom line: Avoid! Nothing you're going to see here. I just hope that Brett Rattner should be just fine about the new Hercules movie cause I know The Rock is going to kick some ass. I wonder if it's way better than The Mummy Returns or The Scorpion King?

They are so inaccurate and give people the wrong perception of history, then again, The Legend of Hercules was directed by Renny Harlin, and he wouldn't put his name on any old thing. After praying to Zeus for guidance, Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee) is picked to carry the son of God. The King however knows that Hercules (Kellan Lutz) isn't his and commits an act of betrayal that separates Hercules from the woman he loves. When I think of the mighty Hercules, Kellan Lutz isn't the first name that comes to mind, but he does a pretty solid job with the role. The rest of the cast also performed equally well, and for once the cast wasn't the problem. A film like this has a story to tell and that story can't be told in an hour and half. I enjoyed the narrative, but the best parts of the film were so rushed, that I felt slighted. The whole Egyptian angle should have been a major theme, but it only lasts about ten minutes, and before you know it, Herc is fighting for his life is arenas around the world, scenes that were also rushed. The film is very straight forward and far too predictable for a story like this. There are Kings and Gods, legends from thousands of years ago, but no twists or turns? No surprises thrown in for dramatic effect at least? Overall, the film is somewhat entertaining and as I said the cast was good, but The Legend of Hercules flies by at the speed of light, which makes the film difficult to really get behind.",

The answer is actually no, it isn't. Having said that it is by no means a great film, but I personally found it more entertaining than say, the po faced 'The Book Thief' or the soon to be marvelled at, but less than marvelous 'Captain America'. It's true the dialogue is uninspired and we have seen all this done before so much better in films like 'Gladiator' and '300' which it is obviously trying to emulate. However, the story is ok if predictable and it doesn't really bore one. Technically the film is more lacking than some. The special effects have a cut price feel to them and the photography comes over as an unfortunate mish mash of styles. The lighting of some scenes resembles cosmetic or shampoo adverts in how they have been shot. Other scenes seem to imply that the weather was not working for the production as they have a washed out desaturated look. I don't think anyone can argue with the fact that Kellan Lutz was built for the part even if an Oscar will not be his any time soon. On the plus side both the music and sound are very good.",

The acceptable stunts and graphics for a B movie, but the let down came from the performances. I don't know what happened to the director, he used to make the better movies in his early career and now he lost his way. Maybe the big stars don't believe in him that may lead him to recruit second stream actors.\r The romance portions were too bad, no chemistry, physics, mathematics, nothing, but just an ordinary without the feelings. When it comes to the game of throne, that's looked okay as it scripted like 'snakes and ladders' game. Anyway, it was a well known story among most of us which was altered and told somewhat differently. Disappoint is there though still somehow watchable.\r Don't force yourself for this, because you are not going to miss any masterpiece. It's becoming a habit in Hollywood, like I already mentioned in a review a year ago that two same thematic movies coming out of a same period.

I dont want to go ito details, there is just one thing I want to point out - when Hercules broke his stone pillars and started to swing with stones I thought - this is where fun must start, I thought I will see some blody bath like it was in 300. Another disappointment - not a sngle droplet of blood was spilled. Guys, they were hit by 200 lb stones, and not a single bone broken? Like wtf, is it a 10k budget movie? And in the end - princess got pierced through by sword survivied, while prince got pickled by sword died, lol. Awful.",

I have a new contender for the worst movie of the year, and it's The Legend of F*cking Hercules. Although \"Transformers: Age of Exinction\" gets an honorable mention, this one really takes the cake. Let me start by saying that Hercules himself is portrayed by a guy who doesn't know how to act and doesn't look handsome, at all. Seriously, he looks ugly. There's one scene where his love interest is dying and instead of... well, you know... performing, he just says a bundle of words and in the next scene, his girlfriend (I think) is suddenly ALIVE! HOW? HOW DID SHE GET BETTER? WHAT HAPPENED? DIDN'T SHE GET STABBED IN HER LEFT SHOULDER?????? AHHH WHATEVER!!!\r It's one problem that this movie has: The pacing. Holy sh*t, the pacing is f*cking horrendous. We jump from one scene to another without substance, feeling more like a marathon than a movie. The plot is convoluted at times, in fact, so convoluted that occasionally you don't know what the characters are talking about. Seriously, along with the bad pacing, we still have banal conversations between underdeveloped characters that are portrayed by untalented people, resulting in a dull movie that is 1 and a half hours (hey, at least, it's not as long as Transformers 4!).\r The action and the effects are reprehensibly bad. One thing I notice in the action sequences is that the director decided to put slow-motion in every single one of them, and I ask: What was the point? Why do you need to put slow-motion in your fight scenes? Hmm? For 3D? But, I'm watching this movie in my house, and I don't have 3D, so the fights don't come as exciting (because they are not). They come as moronic. Hey, I'm not gonna lie, I laughed at some parts. When the movie is not relying on unnecessary slow-motion, they resort to misguidedly choreographed battles. They are barely enthusiastic, if you ask me. It's a pity, because with all the swords, shields and equipment this movie had, it could've been a lot better. Like, A LOT.\r The cast looks bored. Kellan Lutz makes a terrible Hercules. I bet that Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson will make a better Hercules than him, and I haven't seen that movie yet! Luckily, for Lutz, he can't be blamed for torpedoing the project, as everything in this film is sub-par and so bland. The actress who plays the love interest of Lutz's character is just a bad actress. Hey, you girl, hear me out: Your bad performance in this hellish film was noticed by me! I saw how your character died, AND THAT WASN'T EVEN BELIEVABLE IN THE SLIGHTEST! URGH!\r Final Score to The Legend of Hercules: 0/10. Overall, avoid this clusterf*ck of a movie boasting a lackluster plot, generic characters, horrible pacing, uninspiring acting and laughably unexciting battle scenes. GOD, THIS MOVIE IS WORSE THAN TRANSFORMERS AGE OF EXTINCTION AND THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING BECAUSE THAT MOVIE WAS A FLAMING PILE OF SH*T. PLEASE, EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THIS STUPID MOVIE, GROW SOME F*CKING BRAIN CELLS!!\r Uff, Christ...",

And it was pretty good overall using my PSVR on my PS4 Slim. A couple scenes in the dark didn't look good but overall the 3D I would give a 8/10. Now it's not a good movie but it doesn't deserve all the hate it gets. It could have been a 10/10 if they fixed a couple things. First the editing was bizarre. A lot of scenes were cut way too short. It needs to be re edited completely. The 3D was good but the way scenes were cut together is all wrong. I took some editing classes in College and I'm not sure what the editor was thinking here. The dialogue wasn't great. But its's not the only reason why this movie failed. For me if you're going to try to be like the show Spartacus then why abandon all the sex and blood? I was thinking ok these fight scenes are cool but they always cut away not showing any of the actual deaths. Zero nudity and no sex scenes that show anything. If you're trying to be like Spartacus then be like it. They even hired Liam Mcintyre. But he wasn't great in Spartacus, Andy Whitfield was. Unfortunately Andy Whitfield died and Liam Mcintyre replaced him. None of the season's after Blood and Sand were as good as Blood and Sand. But they were still good. Not just because of the sex and violence and blood. But because of the writing. In Spartacus they set up everything and pay it off. It's a great soap opera for men. Its one of my all time favourite shows. The Legend of Hercules is a movie for boys. It should of been rated R but they made it for children. And a movie doesn't have the time to be a show like Spartacus. It just doesn't have the time to set everything up. But it still could be cool. And don't get me wrong some scenes were cool. But there just wasn't any weight behind it. You do get a love story but I just didn't care that much. I did like the scene where Hebe finds Hercules in that little pond area. I felt a little bit of emotion but the dialogue killed it.. But good acting by Gaia Weiss here. I didn't like her in Vikings but this was a good performance by her. She's a good actress I just didn't like what they did with her in Vikings. The actor who played Hercules wasn't great. But I put it on the writing and director. He's either yelling or whispering. I liked Scott Adkins playing King Amphitryon. He was good. And the guy that played his son played his role well. So these are my thoughts right after watching. I will probably edit this again after watching it a couple more times. I would still rather watch this than Avengers Endgame or half of the bad films these days. It doesn't deserve a 0/10. The 3D 8/10 the acting 5/10 the editing 2/10 the dialogue 4/10 the story 6/10 the fight scenes 6/10 It's worth a watch in 3D.",

This film is just one more that doesIts not uncommon, unfortunately, to see Greek mythology being run over and clobbered by cinema or TV, with its most famous stories being rebuilt or turned on things that are anything but Greek mythology. This film is just one more that does precisely that, using characters of the myth of Hercules to create a new story. So I'll start by object the title. This isn't \"The Legend of Hercules\", it's just a story where Hercules enters without us understanding why. Script is so basic and primary that it looks like one of those lousy, melodramatic novels, sold in supermarkets for a few coins. I would even say that screenplay is just an excuse for a ton of action and pure hard pounding which seems inspired by movies like \"300\" or \"Rambo\".Although I have managed to like or digest some of his films, Renny Harlin is far from being a truly skilled director. In this case, he totally lost his notion of ridicule, and this movie will probably haunt him to death. The cast is extraordinarily bad. Kellan Lutz is a lousy protagonist. It may have muscles, but it also has the same dramatic expressiveness as a Guinea Pig. He has no charisma, no presence and cannot express emotions, just strength. I've seen hosts of TV cooking shows with more dramatic skills than this actor, who should look for another profession. Good luck with that, Lutz! Gaia Weiss is attractive but she doesn't seem to know what she's doing there, and is never fully committed to the movie. Somebody give a map to this girl, she's lost and confused! Scott Adkins gave life to a cardboard villain, histrionic and pathetic, worthy of the worst possible death. Roxanne McKee is too young for the role she played. Liam McIntyre seems to be the best actor in this disastrous cast.Visually, the film abuses CGI and sound effects to increase the impact of scenes, especially fights and action. However, the quality of the final work is rather mediocre. Bad cinematography, blurred, with colors between gray and brown, doesn't help either. Combats are utterly unrealistic, some blows and jumps are absurd and that effect of pausing or slowing down the film for a few moments in the midst of a jump or blow is so cliché that it gave me cravings for vomit. Costumes and sets are equally ashamed. The soundtrack is boring and ordinary.In short: this film is a caricature, a cartoon where characters from the Greek legend of Hercules were chewed, dismantled and thrown into a kind of idiotic video game, lifeless and without emotion, for an hour and a half of pointless fights.",
