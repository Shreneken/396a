  "critic_reviews": [
    "Although it won’t win any points for originality, it is a fast-moving little chiller filled with creepy atmosphere and convincing performances.",
    "If there's a problem that gets in the way of some genuinely scary moments, it's that the filmmakers (all four of them) don't ever give you enough information to invest in the characters.",
    "The small achievement of Devil’s Due is how much it both exploits the video-cam approach and overcomes some of its limitations.",
    "While it’s generally above-average for this sorry genre, it’s so derivative, in both style and narrative, that there’s still an overwhelming sense of plodding inevitability to the whole affair.",
    "Although a slow-burn approach to this sort of creepfest is generally a smart move, Devil’s Due peters out of outright suspense midway through and never fully recovers, despite (or possibly because of) a final reel that may shock some viewers but will leave die-hard genre fans gnashing their teeth and rending their clothes in dismay.",
    "It's as substantial as seeing \"The Exorcist\" redone on Snapchat – and let's not even consider the implication of casting black and Latino performers as Satan's minions, because clearly its makers haven't.",
    "Devil’s Due spends far too much time on home movie footage of likeable newlyweds Zach (Zach Gilford) and Samantha McCall (Allison Miller), while neglecting to scare the bejesus out of us.",
    "An ordinary, forgettable horror film. Even the Devil deserves more than this.",
    "Oscillates between the jolting and the absurd, bottoming out with a nonsensical coda.",
    "The dialogue is dull, the performances perfunctory and while it is novel to leave out “the explainer” character — that slim hope that a priest, an expert on the Occult or whoever, can give the characters answers — common to this genre, leaving that character out robs the film of pathos and urgency.",
    "We're more than 45 years out from Roman Polanski's director-controlled masterpiece in gestating terror, and yet no gimmick in Devil's Due — no point-of-view shock cut or shaky-cam \"realism\" — is as dread-inducing as tracking the grim revelations on Mia Farrow's face.",
    "Devlin's script tips its hand so early on that Devil's Due lumbers toward a woefully flat, predictable ending, and the unwelcome promise of something truly demonic — sequels.",
    "Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett direct with competence but a dispiriting lack of originality.",
    "As with most found footage films, there’s a lot of tediousness, with the early proceedings resembling the sort of home movies from which anyone not directly involved would normally flee.",
    "The film expends plenty of effort crafting a few memorable freakout setpieces and nailing down the logistics of its found-footage camera placement, yet it offers precious little in the way of real scares or engaging characters, and even less in original ideas.",
    "It’s more silly than scary.",
    "Devil's Due is one of those films that borrows so many key elements from other and often better movies that genre buffs could amuse themselves by composing lists of all the titles that it blatantly rips off throughout.",
    "The Devil may have all the best tunes, but this really is the worst sort of cinematic karaoke."

This is mediocrity in scene by scene basis. It's almost surprising, if it's not so sad that the producer or director once thought imitation of other horror films could be a substitute for real tension. Furthermore, displaying it in found footage style doesn't add anything, let alone mask the unoriginality.\r The lackluster story is about two couples who happily spend their honeymoon, but in the end meet with dubious characters. After some bizarre forgettable occurrence, the bride is pregnant. No, this is not Hangover, although it would’ve been better. What follows is a mix between pregnancy scare and overused gimmicks. The theme has been used before, but this is acceptable, many movies use already proven formula and produces new material. Devil's Due, on the other hand, cobbles together pieces of other works in hope of anyone who hasn't watched horror movies in years will find it amusing.\r Its use of found footage mechanic further confuses the plot, because some of the scenes shouldn't have been captured in the first place. It uses all security cameras which are in vicinity of the story, it's not only one vlogger type, yet it still feels unauthentic and staged to capture certain scenes. It probably would've been slightly better if it's done in simple third person view.\r There's not much excellence in acting either, the usual scream and frantic gaze. As an intimate experience of maternity, the movie could've depicted more personal issue. The scares aren't much better, often showing people in trance or shouting randomly. Every part of the movie is dull, any horror it has is watered down because it's near exact replica of others.\r Granted, those who had or having the delicate 9 months marathon could appreciate it better, but why would they watch this movie, why would anyone for that matter?",

After you have seen 1500 people scream and gush blood from every pint possible the whole things gets really old. What helps this film is the way the couple are portrayed as genuinely being in love with each other. Their bond does not survive the onslaught of evil doers-so why even make the film?

Normally, I don't have prejudices with remakes or rip-offs, but some well-honored and acclaimed films leave no room for that and, when that happens, we quickly find that the new movie is so inferior to the first one that it doesn't justify its existence. It's more or less what happens here. The plot is almost the same: Zach and Samantha are a couple on their honeymoon. However, after a party where both get drunk, Samantha feels she is raped during a satanic cult. On waking, however, they thinks this was a dream, not feeling any mistrust when she becomes pregnant. This will change over the course of her pregnancy, as Samantha takes on a strange behavior. The plot brings little new when compared to the classic film that precedes it and it's clearly inferior in quality. It all seems unrealistic, far-fetched and absurd, which is criminal in a film that had low production budget but a huge budget for advertising. The actors' performance is mediocre. Allison Miller and Zach Gilford are the main actors and they certainly tried to do their best, but the truth is that the material they were given was too bad and they just ended up dropping their characters. Personally, I don't blame them, I blame the directors (Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett) and screenwriter, Lindsay Devlin. The film spends most of its time focused on the changes of the pregnant girl, at a deliberately slow pace that would help create suspense if we didn't predict what would happen so easily, if the ending wasn't so uninteresting and if special effects weren't so basic.",
