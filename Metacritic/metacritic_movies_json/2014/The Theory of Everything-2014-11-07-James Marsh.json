  "critic_reviews": [
    "Just in physical terms, Eddie Redmayne transformation’s into Stephen Hawking is something remarkable.",
    "Visually imaginative, The Theory of Everything is an unusually compelling true-life story about an extraordinary couple triumphing over adversity. It’s my favorite movie so far this year.",
    "This is the extraordinary biopic about the fascinating, complex and inspirational example set by genius cosmologist and physicist Stephen Hawking.",
    "Many moviegoers may think they already know a good deal about Hawking’s achievements, but they would do themselves a disservice to miss out on Redmayne’s almost perfect performance.",
    "The film is striking, at times even piercing, for the way it infiltrates some universal realities of marriage.",
    "A brainy bio that exerts a gravitational pull on the heartstrings.",
    "Redmayne should be getting a lot of notice for his performance; it's palpable, it's poignant. Jones, too, is terrific. And Marsh, who won the documentary Academy Award for his Philippe Petit Twin Towers caper Man on Wire, brings a keen artistry to The Theory of Everything.",
    "This delightful and inspiring drama succeeds the way Hawking has, even as he fails to deliver that “one theory” that explains “everything.” It’s reaching beyond your grasp, in life, in science and in film biographies, that achieves greatness.",
    "The Theory of Everything, referring to Hawking's dream of finding an equation to explain all existence, is riveting science, emotional provocation and one-of-a-kind love story all rolled into one triumphant film.",
    "I couldn't help wishing that The Theory of Everything had more theory. Hawking famously excels at explaining complicated thoughts with layman simplicity, but the film never translates the originality and depth of his ideas — or even what they are.",
    "A lovingly balanced biopic that fends off award-gobbling clichés. Smarts + heart = a winner: it’s a simple equation, but Marsh makes it add up.",
    "A compassionate and inspiring look at an extraordinary life, anchored by two of the best performances of the year.",
    "The Theory of Everything breaks down simply, perhaps too much so: a great performance in a good movie.",
    "Marsh makes the most of McCarten's effective script. There's a real energy to his filmmaking, the ability to be intelligently dramatic without overdoing things that is ideally suited to material that would be so easy to get wrong.",
    "James Marsh’s movie, which co-stars Felicity Jones as Jane Hawking, the celebrated physicist’s wife, is a biographical love story that doesn’t depend on science to shape the plot — it’s rich in emotional intelligence.",
    "Jones and Redmayne are both superb as a devoted but imperfect pair of headstrong people trying, and sometimes failing, to treat each other with care and respect.",
    "At its best (which is often), director James Marsh’s affecting biopic of the cosmos-rattling astrophysicist Stephen Hawking plays deftly against schmaltz.",
    "It's a film to leave you reeling but cheered, too. It's about battling love, as well as illness. A universal story, extracted from a unique one.",
    "What’s onscreen is less a cerebral experience than a stirring and bittersweet love story, inflected with tasteful good humor, that can’t help but recall earlier disability dramas like “My Left Foot” and “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.”",
    "What takes The Theory of Everything into the cosmos is Redmayne’s extraordinary performance. The disciplined precision with which he progressively embodies Hawking’s failing body is nothing short of astonishing.",
    "This movie about a great woman and a great man ends up merely good.",
    "Like \"The King’s Speech\" or \"Shakespeare in Love,\" The Theory of Everything sometimes feels a bit too polished and precise, leaving no room for ambiguity and always staying easy to digest, like elegant pap.",
    "The Theory of Everything, in other words, is Jane’s movie as much as it is Stephen’s, and while Eddie Redmayne’s performance deserves every bit of praise and statuary it will get, Felicity Jones has the subtler, less showy role to play and matches him frame for frame.",
    "The movie's pretty light on matters of science. It works best as a study of human vulnerability and love's way with us all, and as such, a handsomely mounted, slightly hollow picture by the end becomes a very affecting one.",
    "It’s an exceptional film, not because of its protagonists’ impressive triumphs, but because it honors their struggle.",
    "An unremarkable bio-pic about a remarkable man.",
    "Even if you were never the sort who cared what goes on behind others’ closed doors, the Hawkings’ drama is catnip. And if you’ll excuse the pun, you could say it was only a matter of time before Hollywood came calling.",
    "The film is involving, nimbly acted and smartly directed, though conventional in its narrative style.",
    "The film is a boilerplate biopic, but with stunning cinematography and a couple of fierce performances, The Theory of Everything is nothing if not an accomplished and emotional work of cinema.",
    "The film gives Jones (Oxford) a chance to take control of its emotional center, and she seizes it with spectacular subtlety. She proves that behind this Great Man movie is a woman – an actress – who’s every bit her man’s equal.",
    "Facing the physical challenges of depicting Hawking’s disability, Redmayne pulls it off with enormous grace and endurance.",
    "Well-acted and lovingly designed, Marsh's movie falls far short of the genius it attempts to celebrate.",
    "Highly uneven, but at least it doesn’t glamorize Hawking’s life or turn it into a paean to endurance.",
    "No matter how much The Theory of Everything showcases the incredible process through which Hawking maintains a connection to the rest of the world, it falls short of burrowing inside his head.",
    "This is a well-made, well-acted but unexceptional film about one of the most exceptional figures of the last half-century.",
    "It’s a biopic about one of the most brilliant people in the history of the planet, the renowned astrophysicist Stephen Hawking – a man famous for thinking in boldly innovative ways – yet his story is told in the safest and most conventional method imaginable.",
    "If The Theory of Everything cut as deeply as Redmayne's performance, it might be on the level of \"My Left Foot.\" But there are so damn many problems, easy to ignore at first in the elation of watching Redmayne and the gossamer Felicity Jones as his future wife, Jane, but impossible to shake off in the last third.",
    "Yes, The Theory of Everything has a different emphasis. But like so many cinematic lives of the famous, it loses track of the source of its subject’s fame.",
    "Rather than go for big ideas, the movie cozies up to small wonders. Instead of an ah-ha moment, we get a sigh of familiarity. Still, in this biopic about Hawking, there’s one explosion that blows your mind: Eddie Redmayne’s performance. Redmayne as Hawking, if the stars align, should be an Oscar lock.",
    "The Theory of Everything makes a pass at the complexities of love, but what’s onscreen requires a bit more investigation.",
    "With so many elements working on such a high plain, it is ultimately a shame that The Theory of Everything remains a formulaic biopic with a scope far narrower than its subject. Still, it broaches universal themes through the story of a man who studies the universe, and succeeds in being a life and love-affirming along the way.",
    "It’s certainly Redmayne’s film, and his performance is everything you could ask for: completely convincing in its physicality, credible in its pain, and warmly but not crassly optimistic in its nearly constant good temper.",
    "Despite a handsome production and two genuinely brilliant lead performances, The Theory Of Everything stumbles into virtually every pitfall that afflicts biopics about geniuses.",
    "Meticulous in its adherence to conventional narrative inducement, this biopic only offers a sanded-down and embossed vision of Stephen Hawking and Jane Wilde's 30-year marriage.",
    "It takes Hawking getting out of his wheelchair — a sequence as tender as it is tasteless — for The Theory Of Everything to register as anything more than impersonal kitsch. It is the one ballsy moment in an otherwise thoroughly neutered movie.",
    "And let's be honest: Hawking and Wilde's romance is lovely in its own way. But his scientific work? That's important. That's staggering. That's life-changing, not just for him, but for all of us. And The Theory of Everything? Despite that title, and despite those performances, it just doesn't feel like any of those things.",
    "Director James Marsh (already an Oscar winner for the documentary \"Man on Wire\") and screenwriter Anthony McCarten (adapting Jane Hawking's memoir) opt for the safe, pretty, and reassuring English period-piece choices the whole way through, as if deliberately underselling the fact that this is a story about two remarkable people facing extraordinary circumstances."

But this movie just feels too neatly tied and a bit too angelic. Everyone in this movie is so perfect. There are no character flaws whatsoever. Even when Stephen and Jane separated, Jane just fell on her knees and said \"I'm sorry I wasn't of better service to you. I did my best\". That's just manipulative and mawkish beyond belief. It was an insult to the audiences' intelligence. But that being said, the movie does balance Stephen Hawking's marriage, his illness and his work very well.﻿ But it's disappointing to see this film following the quintessential trite, mundane and conventional biopic formula, given that it's about a truly unconventional and exceptional man.",

Those of you who expected science can stop watching immediately - unfortunately, the love story that is the substitute central plot element is not interesting enough to draw the attention of romantic-movie fans.\r The Theory of Everything makes Hawking's disabilities basically the only thing worth mentioning, flying over his achievements and even his general way of picturing the world - and rather focusing on his wife and his love story, despite the lack of the amount of drama this would require to be effective.\r In general, a clumsily edited picture with no pretenses and presented as an unfortunate series of clichés about scientists, handicap and extramarital relationships, in this order.",

So we end up with a few odd scenes (amongst all the love-stuff) where Stephen speaks to a room full of people about his theories and then everyone stands up and starts applauding him and how brilliant he is. But, for the unintelligent people in the cinema like me who don't have a clue what he's on about because the movie doesn't provide a single iota of the background work or thoughts then went into these theories, you're left feeling like he may as well have said 'Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah'. And everyone still would have stood up and cheered, because the Movie Director needed a few uplifting moments.\rAnd, boy, does it need those uplifting scenes in amongst the grey, depressing story of a man diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease. Yes, Stephen Hawking has accomplished a great deal in his lifetime so far but so much of this movie focuses on the struggles of his wife, Jane, to cope with looking after him as his condition worsens that the film ends up feeling more informative than entertaining (and what do we go to the cinema/movie theatre for if not to be entertained?)\rMy other issue with the movie is that, especially when you find out that it's based on a book by Jane, it feels distinctly like it glosses over the foibles of his then-wife and yet highlights the flaws of others. Her being unfaithful garners five seconds of screen time but when Elaine (Maxine Peake) shows up later in the movie to help Stephen, she's portrayed as something like a naughty nurse from a 'Carry On' movie who tries (in several scenes) to undermine Jane. It's these things that - especially when considering whose book this movie is based upon - make it feel like it may be a slightly biased version of events.\rHowever, there are positives about the movie that need to be highlighted. There are some greatly funny moments and these are often provided by Stephen's university room-mate Brian (played wonderfully by Harry Lloyd). He brings some much-needed laughter to a sometimes otherwise dreary movie.\rOf course, the main highlight of the film is the performance of Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking. As I write this review, he is Oscar-nominated for it and I would be shocked if he does not win the award. Without such an outstanding job by the leading actor, I feel that 'The Theory of Everything' would have fallen completely flat but his outstanding performance is absolutely spot on.\rOverall, if you're interested in Stephen Hawking then - by all means - you may find 'The Theory of Everything' worth watching. Otherwise, there's not much to be gained here other than seeing a tired, generic love story in a different setting.",

Based on the memoir by Jane Hawking it is at first surprising to find how much the screenplay concentrates on her. It is to the credit of Felicity Jones that she becomes the film’s ace card. She truly shines here as Jane and it is almost totally due to her subtly understated performance that the story’s emotions feel honest and not overly manipulated. Eddie Redmayne is also very good, especially with the physicality the role demands, but surprisingly his role seems somewhat underwritten. The screenplay pays scant attention to his professional achievements concentrating instead on his disability and the challenges this posed to the couple’s marriage. Anyone not knowing anything about Stephen Hawking going in to this film would be hard pressed to understand the reverence in which he is held, the tragedy of his physical battles notwithstanding. Ironically, criticism levelled at 'The Imitation Game' and the lack of personal details about Alan Turing's personal life would be more pertinently aimed here at Hawking's professional one.  Montages are adopted to delineate time lines to mixed success, but probably the biggest indication of the film’s failure is due to the fact that one is more interested in the love story between Jane and Jonathan than in the one between Jane and Stephen.",

Everything from the production design and costumes to the cinematography and editing helped accent the emotional struggle of the characters. With Oscar-worthy performances by Redmayne and Jones and brilliant direction by James Marsh the audience is taken on a charmingly humorous and emotional ride through the life of the Hawkings.\r I was a bit disappointed with the story in two aspects. Firstly, I believe that the film was subjected to some restricted narrative construction to appease the still living subjects of the film. In biographies of deceased people the filmmakers tend to push the boundaries and add a bit of controversy or increased tension. If Marsh was going for a more biographical, documentary film than a biographical drama, then he certainly succeeded. However, I feel even with the restrictions that this film delivered. Secondly, I was not pleased with the lack of science in the film. This film is about Stephen Hawking, one of the greatest minds to ever walk this Earth, and yet we are more interested in his personal life? Yes the film is a recount of Stephen's life through the eyes of his ex-wife Jane, but being the only film about Stephen Hawking they could have at least explained some of the interesting theories and research he worked on throughout his life.\r Regardless this film delivers a brilliantly charming biopic about a man whose dynamism was hidden by his overachieving mind. Although Stephen is the star of the film, the true star of the story is Jane whose strength and dedication to Stephen helped bring us The Theory of Everything. His mind changed our world, her love changed his.",

It is also the story of self-sacrifice and dedication as told through the eyes of his wife of 25 years, Jane, who, together with Anthony McClaren, co authored the screenplay based on her book \"My Life With Stephen\". The film was directed by James Marsh and stars Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. One must approach this film as both a factual summary of the trials and efforts of a genius confined to the prison of his voiceless and motionless body and, also, as an entertainment vehicle. For the former the film serves its purpose well and is made even more believable by Mr. Redmayne’s remarkable likeness to Mr. Hawkng  and the performances given by both he and Ms. Jones.  As to the latter, the film is certainly not \"entertaining\" in the true sense of the word but represents one of those \"should see\" see films because of its biographical data and the efforts of its two stars. This is indeed a difficult film to rate for much depends on the needs and desires of the viewer and whether he or she considers watching Mr. Redmayne’s character struggle with a catastrophic disability for over 2 hours worth the effort. My experience of the film may well have been affected by the fact that I saw a PBS documentary with the real life Hawkings a few days earlier. That being said, I give the film  a 7 rating because it basically is locked to the actual story of the subjects with little or no poetic license or interest creating insertions.. Remember, though, as with  \"My Left Foot\",also a fairly difficult film to watch, it did earn Danel Day Lewis an Oscar and I wouldn’t be surprised if the same fate awaited Mr. Redmayne.",

Why, because he isn't acting!!!! Also, the blatant use of Americanisms to sell it to the US. In the UK it is Leg or Breast, not light meat or dark meat. Also it is Motor Neurone Disease in the UK and ALS in the US, until Ice Bucket no-one here would have referred to Lou Gehrigs Disease and certainly not in 1963.",

What makes the movie more interesting is the way of approaching his life, not focused in one aspect, it shows the scientific part, the family part and the illness part. The first one is very impressive, starting by the epiphanies that he experiences, how he developed his theories and how he breaks with current knowledge. The family part gives us a more human image of this genius and his relationship with his wife Jane. And finally, the illness and how the couple deals with it is very well achieved. These last two are unknown for the viewer and James Marsh is not afraid to show the most dramatic episodes making it a heartbreaking story but always realistic. This whole thing goes hand by hand with a breathtaking performances of Eddie Redmayne, it is unbelievable what he has created and Felicity Jones is perfect in her role. Then we have the script, the score (so captivating that distracted me from the movie several times) and the work with the cameras; all very coherent with the protagonist obsession: time, and its sublimation in that magnificent sequence at the end.",

Not knowing of how true is the screenwriters adapting Stephen Hawking's life to the big screen, but the moderate pacing does not upset the audiences as it fills with a lot of interesting theoretic dialogues which some might be funny and the special yet specific cinematography has successfully crafted a beautiful life full of love. A big applause for Eddie Redmayne who has worked hard to portray a character with motor neuron disease that looks extremely real, nature yet pitiful; while Felicity Jones is doing great to support by building up a charming and emotional chemistry. With amazing and calm scores from Jóhann Jóhannsson to enhance the overall tone of the film, the biopic inspires us that when there is life, there will be hope and so, to be courageous, to be strong in overcoming challenges, it will still be successful in achieving dreams. It also ends impressively and audiences would have stunt for a moment thinking on what we have made so far in our life.",

It is, simply put, a fantastic, life-affirming film that is propelled forward by its story and its leading roles. In that order. And the rest of the film is pretty good too. But “The Theory of Everything” isn’t all about Stephen Hawking (played by Eddie Redmayne) and how incredible his story is. Instead the film is “part biopic, part love story” with the latter telling us about the imperfect marriage between Stephen Hawking and Jane Wilde (played by Felicity Jones).\rEddie Redmayne is fantastic as Stephen Hawking and what is best at how he portrays Hawking getting worse in regards to his Motor Neurone Disease (/ALS). Redmayne starts the film as a young Hawking and we can tell this guy is clever. But it is as the film goes on that Redmayne’s performance gets better. Halfway through the film we are looking at a slouched Redmayne, slurring his words and occasionally smiling and by the end of the film we are looking at Redmayne playing Hawking as he is now. In testament to this the real-life Stephen Hawking commented, on seeing the film, that he felt he was sometimes looking back in time at himself. I’m with him. His performance is again, incredible, as incredible as the story he has the privilege to tell. If I don’t see him in the running for the Best Actor Oscar come February then I will be surprised.\rFelicity Jones performance as Jane Wilde is magnificent too. Although on the surface she doesn’t seemingly require the various skills that Redmayne has to delve into, she again does the story and her real-life counterpart justice. Although she starts the film as a student, we come to see her having to raise 3 children as well as look after her husband and you feel that she really is going through all this. Again, the real-life Jane Wilde was impressed with Jones’ performance. When I think about Best Actress potential this year, she should also be in the running for the appropriate Oscar.\rHarry Lloyd is brilliant as Stephen’s university friend Brian too. Although Brian is a mere composite character, he is a brilliant one at that. His attitude is drawn from Jane’s descriptions of “Stephen’s fellow lodgers and research students” at Cambridge: “They talked to him in his own intellectual terms, sometimes caustically sarcastic, sometimes crushingly critical, always humorous. In personal terms, however, they treated him with a gentle consideration which was almost loving.” He could also be in for an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\rBut it is the story that really propels “The Theory of Everything” forward and it provides for half the reason as to why the films leads are fantastic. The film itself is based on Jane Wilde’s 2008 autobiography “Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen”, a flattering account of their initial marriage and a significantly different, revised edition of the 1999 autobiography “Music to Move the Stars: My Life with Stephen”, a less flattering account of their marriage, sparked when Hawking left Wilde for his nurse Elaine Mason in 1990. (It’s worth noting they quietly divorced in 2006 following a 5 year period of rumours over whether Mason abused Hawking, apparently hitting him, throwing him around and even leaving him in the sun to burn for several hours.) The revised edition was sparked by her and Hawking managing to develop a good working relationship with Wilde.\rThe story of “The Theory of Everything”, as I said earlier, is “part biopic, part love story”. We learn in the film of how clever Hawking was and how he refused to let his disability stop him from being great, initially managing to overcome the 2 years he was given to live and ultimately managing to become a household name. But this isn’t what “The Theory of Everything” is really about. Although the film does give Hawking his due, it’s not as if Eddie Redmayne has a bigger role than Felicity Jones. Their roles are coequal and the film thus focuses on Stephen and Jane’s relationship, in particular how Wilde had to cope with raising 3 children whilst looking after her husband.\r“The Theory of Everything” is a fantastic film with a fantastic story and two fantastic leads. The only problem I had with the film, and it’s always there for me when I watch this kind of film, is although it is never boring, you do find yourself occasionally wondering how long is left. But this is not the final thought I want to leave you with. Instead, let me remind you that “The Theory of Everything” is again, a fantastic film and worth seeing if you get the chance. It tells you something that apparently a nurse wiped a tear from Hawking’s eye when he first saw the film.",

Although, it's tastefully done, the story is does not shy away from the difficulty they faced.\r The Theory of Everything seamlessly shows their life, the personal side of thing, and it's no romantic comedy. The film tells a great deal of what this brilliant man and his wife had to endure. Jane married this genius man, on borrowed time, planning to cherish the little time they had but in time found herself with a husband, whose slowly crumbling body, demands a lot of her. Stephen, this brilliant young man, who had a bright future in front of him, found himself faced with a hurdle he can't possibly overcome and only live with. Their story is beautifully told, fascinating but also cruel.\r The Theory of Everything is subtle and clever. Like I said, it's not an overly sugar-coated and romanticized story of Stephen and Jane Hawking. They are portrayed as strong and determined people but they're also flawed, which makes them human and very likable. I was touched all the way through, immersed into the story and into their lives, but I did not pity them I admired them. The immersion into the story is wonderfully accompanied by the score. It gives an extra layer to such a beautiful story.\r The cast is just superb, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones really deserve the nominations and awards they got because they carried the movie. Redmayne was incredible and once you fathom the amount of work and details that went into this performance, you realize how impressive Eddie Redmayne's performance is. Felicity Jones, though, is the cherry on top the movie wouldn't have been as good without her in it. She's sweet and incredibly good as Jane Hawking her eyes speak for themselves in the movie. She's brilliant.\r As Biopics go, The Theory of Everything is a great one among the many we had this year with Unbroken, and The Imitation Game, or Selma. When the story's great and you have a very talented cast, the director is often overlooked James March did a stellar job.\r I now understand what all the fuss is about.

This is the fact that there are two major theories in physics—the theory of general relativity, which is used to make very accurateThe  Theory of Everything refers to the elusive resolution to the paradox that faces all physicists. This is the fact that there are two major theories in physics—the theory of general relativity, which is used to make very accurate predictions about the behavior of massive objects in space, such as planets, stars and galaxies, and the theory of quantum mechanics, which predicts, also with great accuracy, the behavior of invisible particles such as protons, neurons, and quarks. The problem is that the two theories contradict each other, but since they are employed in completely different realms, there is usually no conflict; however, there are a few situations where the two theories are both applicable and stand in opposition to each other. Therefore, another more integrating and all-encompassing mathematical equation is needed to unify the two theories and reconcile all the forces of the universe, and this is called the Theory of Everything, sought in vain by Albert Einstein himself for the last thirty years of his life.\r As critic Mike Scott pointed out about the film, Hawking’s preoccupation with the Theory of Everything appears as a background process, superficially discussed in conversations and occasionally depicted on blackboards filled with mathematical formulas. A layman’s version of the theoretical quest is given by Hawking’s wife, Jane (Felicity Jones) when she tells a dinner guest that there are two major theories of physics to be reconciled, one dealing with the large objects (“potatoes”) and one dealing with the small objects (“peas”).\r Since the film is based on Jane Hawking’s autobiography (Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen), the emphasis is on the romance between Jane and Stephen Hawking (played by Eddie Redmayne), their subsequent marriage and raising of children, their heartbreaking but in many ways triumphant struggle with his ALS, and their ultimate break-up. It is actually a fascinating aspect of his life, perhaps almost as fascinating as the Theory of Everything. Through sheer determination, a young man who was given two years to live not only survived for fifty years (and counting), but he resolutely sought to have all the experiences he would have had as an able-bodied adult—career, romance, marriage, children, and even divorce and remarriage, and then another divorce. As a friend who picks up the young Hawking to carry him up a flight of stairs asks rather pointedly, “Stephen, is everything affected?” And Hawking replies, “No, it’s a different system—it’s automatic.” Eddie Redmayne comes as close to becoming his subject as is possible for any actor to get.\r Despite the intrigue and complications in his personal life, Hawking was always obsessively at work on brilliant ideas that included the discovery of Hawking radiation, his theories about the origin and boundaries of the universe, and his best-selling popular science books, among other projects and theories, making him one of the most famous physicists in the world. The details of this ongoing intellectual process would have made for an interesting portrayal in the film, since his work is the most fascinating and most important part of the miracle of Stephen Hawking’s life.",

Music like that for some strange reason makes my feel more life inside of me, and the people who did the music I give them two thumbs up for that.\r But what the movie dose lack on is that they didn't really sell the fact that Hawking is a genius, and we know that he is but in this movie everybody didn't really seem all that filled with his mind blowing work, everybody was all like \"Yeah great job man, that's some good stuff\". but really they should be losing their sh't over how smart Hawking was.\r Theory of Everything is a well made Biography movie with fantastic performers from Eddie and Felicity, excellent directing and a pretty nice score.",

ItAs far as biopics go, The Theory of Everything is much more entertaining than most. Yet it cannot escape biopic conformities; aside from incongruous cinematography, there is very little to set this flick apart from its competition. It contains outstanding performances, but so do Mr. Turner and The Imitation Game, 2014’s other critically-acclaimed non-fictional character studies. The Theory of Everthing is worth watching for the performances alone – but the film is only a decent one, with its rather confined plot rendering it unable to excel.",

I went into the movie knowing that this film did not focus on the science that Dr. Hawking studied, but rather the relationship between him and his wife. Nonetheless I genuinely enjoyed the movie. The movie wastes no time setting things up between Stephen and Jane. They are introduced to each other a couple of minutes into the movie, and from there, their story continues to develop. It also showcases the severity of Stephen's illness, and the emotional toll it takes on himself and Jane. Stephen and Jane's relationship isn't sunshine throughout. There are plenty of rocky moments they go through, many of which stem from Stephen's behavior and his suffering. Throughout the movie, their relationship is like a rollercoaster; rising and falling suddenly and often. The movie doesn't shy away from being a bit funny as well. There are moments in the movie that may make someone laugh, and those sections are well placed. The best part of the movie is by far the acting. Eddie Redmayne does amazing as Dr. Stephen Hawking. I feel that there isn't a better fit for the role than him. He portrays Hawking in a manner that isn't offensive, and really stays true to Hawking in real life. Felicity Jones as Jane Hawking is the show stealer. I have always been a huge fan of Felicity Jones, and this movie showcases her brilliant acting skills. Overall, I loved this movie. Although it isn't a science movie like I hoped, I really do like the portrayal of Stephen and Jane's relationship as they struggle with Stephen's condition.",

Yet it's dealt  with so glibly to be laughably unbelievable. Seriously, I think my wife taking care of two kids at home by herself without a disabled husband demonstrates and communicates more stress than the Jane character does.\r Seriously a woman gives up her hopes and dreams to care for a disabled person and his kids Instead, her resentment is rather sugar coated. She rarely speaks up for herself. And she doesn't experience any other kind of mental breakdown. The one time she tries to bring it up to her husband he laughs about it. She doesn't pull over the car and give him a piece of her mind? Or let in bottle up until she snaps?\r The most hilarious part of this is when something is \"too much\" cause it involves 3 kids potentially going camping with their mom in France while dad is at an opera. Seriously? That's what crosses the line? Not, you know EVERYDAY fact of taking care of an extremely disabled man and three kids. WTF.\r A more realistic version of this film makes Jane's life appear far more horrifying and isolating. It should have made Stephen's celebrity a source of deep, deep resentment. His inability to agree to simple ways to help her deeply insulting. It should show the despair of the female caregiver, stuck. The unquenchable anger at a man that has all the fun. It should be far more critical of Stephen Hawking and somewhat critical of Jane if she seriously can't seem to communicate her feelings.\r On the plus side this film has a tremendous performance by Redmayne. He thoroughly inhabits the image of Stephen Hawking we all are familiar with. I enjoyed the early romance and the chemistry between the leads was great. Having visited Cambridge, the setting was filmed beautifully.",

Son histoire personnelle à faire pleurer les ménagères de moins de 50 ans (et le reste) aurait sans doute été maintes fois refusée si elle avait germé de l'esprit alcoolisé d'un quelconque quidam plus ou moins écrivaillon à ses délires perdus mais la réalité comme de coutume dépasse toujours la fiction.Les acteurs incarnant à l'écran ce couple hors norme sont tout simplement brillants et d'une justesse étonnante, la mise en scène appliquée, soignée est indéniablement efficace. Puis la musique tout de même nous met la puce à l'oreille (tous ces violons...) et l'ensemble du film, du reste : cette commisération géante, cette communion universelle avec le malheur d'un homme atteint d'une maladie dégénérative incurable... n'est-ce pas un peu trop finalement ?Des larmes, du courage, et du misérabilisme surtout. Et quelques omissions à propos du prêtre : quel est le point de vue d'Hawking à ce sujet ? le scénariste a préféré l'escamoter, on ne saura pas ce qu'il en pense ni ce qu'il ressent. Ah l'infirme n'était pas au courant ? ou pas encore ? Je note que le scénariste prend toujours soin de ne pas écorner sa femme, la pieuse et glorieuse \"Mère Teresa\". Une sainte vous dis-je.La théorie, l'oeuvre du cosmologiste, est trop mise en retrait, faute d'avoir pu \"vulgariser\" suffisamment des concepts sans doute un peu trop techniques pour la ménagère de moins de 50 ans : on préfère lui faire sortir encore quelques mouchoirs et Dieu sait qu'ils ont fort à faire les mouchoirs pour éponger les hectolitres déversés devant le chemin de croix du génie grabataire.Cela étant, le film dispose de cette autre qualité : faire connaître cet homme singulier mais surtout donner envie de lire ses bouquins qui ont l'air tout aussi singulier.
