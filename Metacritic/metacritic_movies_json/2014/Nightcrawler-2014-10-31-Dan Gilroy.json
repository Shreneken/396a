  "critic_reviews": [
    "This is a classic film, not just because every scene and line is casually beautiful and devoid of extraneous touches, but because its tone is mercilessly exact.",
    "Mr. Gyllenhaal’s startling portrayal is far from the only distinction in this impeccably crafted feature film. Mr. Gilroy’s directorial debut connects its hero’s tacit madness to the larger craziness of a broadcast medium that teaches vast numbers of viewers to live with a false sense of insecurity.",
    "Sharp, dark, satirical and bone-rattlingly thrilling, with a career-peak turn from Jake Gyllenhaal. It’s this year’s \"Drive.\"",
    "Gilroy, vastly supported by cinematographer and Los Angeles specialist Robert Elswit (Boogie Nights, Magnolia), directs with the verve of a seasoned pro, even though Nightcrawler is his debut.",
    "The film plays with tension beautifully, and there are a few set pieces that I think are all-timers.",
    "A fantastic, sleek and fun satire.",
    "Gyllenhaal is in almost every frame of writer-director Dan Gilroy's first feature, skinny and wide-eyed, running down a driveway with his camera or cutting across oncoming traffic in the Challenger. It's an intense performance, the flip side of Ryan Gosling's in \"Drive,\" playing the angles and filling space with empty words instead of soulful silences.",
    "There’s tremendous social and moral texture throughout the drama, but the socio-economic commentary of the movie is fabric, not heavy handed accessory. And the provocative ethical breaches—savage and scathing in the latter half—give the movie its delectable and wicked bite.",
    "Nightcrawler is pulp with a purpose. A smart, engaged film powered by an altogether remarkable performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, it is melodrama grounded in a disturbing reality, an extreme scenario that is troubling because it cuts close to the bone.",
    "Nightcrawler executes its ideas with tremendous craft and cool, and the courageous and counterintuitive pairing of its leads — Russo is 60, and Gyllenhaal 33 – produces two electrical, interlocking performances and undeniable erotic chemistry.",
    "If you see him (Jake Gyllenhaal)onscreen in Nightcrawler, you’ll have a closeup view of one of the movie year’s most compelling sociopaths. He’s something you can’t turn away from.",
    "Releasing Nightcrawler on Halloween may seem counterintuitive, but then again, when better to release a thoroughly gripping portrait of an utterly modern sociopath?",
    "In his own twisted way, Lou is just as much a bloodsucker as Dracula, in a horror story that this tabloid veteran can attest is not as far removed from reality as you might assume.",
    "Nightcrawler curves and hisses its way into your head with demonic skill. When the laughs come, they stick in your throat. This is a deliciously twisted piece of work. And Gyllenhaal, coiled and ready to spring, is scarily brilliant. He truly is a monster for our time.",
    "Thirty pounds lighter, all cheekbones and bulging eyes, Gyllenhaal plays one of the year's most memorable characters in this dark, provocative drama.",
    "Gilroy vividly evokes both the LA exteriors and newsroom interiors, and the action sequences are fraught with tension.",
    "The dramatic weight loss Gyllenhaal endured for the role, which transforms his dreamboat looks into a bat-like mask, is startling. But the actor's performance is just as impressive, nimbly selling Gilroy's occasionally overwritten lines while Louis’ punishing optimism finds new gradations of sadism and rage. Nightcrawler is the arrival of a thrilling character actor.",
    "In its wickedly twisted way, Nightcrawler keeps \"Network's\" battle cry alive. It's a 21st-century takedown of the media's pandering ''if it bleeds, it leads'' ethos and the ghoulish nightcrawlers who live by it.",
    "The movie has a caffeinated spirit worthy of its graveyard shift milieu, a darkness artfully breached by cinematographer Robert Elswit, who previously framed L.A.'s unstill life in Magnolia and Boogie Nights.",
    "A thick film of sleaze coats every frame of Nightcrawler, a movie that takes a hard look at media culture and provides Jake Gyllenhaal a terrific opportunity to creep us all out.",
    "On the strength of Gyllenhaal's performance, Nightcrawler works best as a character study. It's chilling, but also wickedly funny and strange, like a good, dark Brian De Palma joke — in short, it's everything the stolid and humorless Gone Girl should have been.",
    "Gyllenhaal is sensational headlining a pitch-black satire with its finger on the pulse.",
    "From a subdued start Nightcrawler unfurls into a ghoulish and wickedly funny satire on journalism, the job market and self-help culture.",
    "The trouble is that absolutely nothing about the movie feels like news.",
    "Yet, despite a mesmerizing performance by Gyllenhaal - he's as transfixing as a cobra in a snake charmer's dance - and a terrific turn by Riz Ahmed as an unskilled homeless kid Louis hires as his assistant, Nightcrawler doesn't quite have the satirical smarts that made \"Network\" a classic.",
    "The most notable element of screenwriter Dan Gilroy's debut feature is the performance he elicits from Jake Gyllenhaal. In the tradition of Brando, Bale, Theron, and others, Gyllenhaal undergoes a radical physical transformation to play the part of Louis Bloom.",
    "Nightcrawler is about TV news-video parasites, but the freakiest thing in it — the biggest bedbug of all — is Jake Gyllenhaal as the movie’s hero, Lou Bloom.",
    "The film has a sulfuric, Dostoyevskian quality — and sick sense of humor — that captures the muted aquarium that Los Angeles becomes at night, a spell that’s broken once plot overtakes mood.",
    "There are moments that are too macabre and outlandish, but Gilroy steers the movie just this side of farce, just this side of Chayefsky, and keeps it all within a realistic framework. At times watching, you might wonder how he’ll keep the story going, how he’ll top himself. But he does.",
    "Despite the familiarity of its themes — the bottom-feeding news media; the pathology born of extreme isolation and a little too much online time; the American can-do spirit, perverted into something poisonous — Gilroy's clever, skeezy little noir is worth a prowl.",
    "Nightcrawler is a portrait of an amoral opportunist who stumbles upon his horrible calling, and the film’s chief pleasure is watching Gyllenhaal portray what it might be like if Rushmore’s Max Fischer grew up to become Chuck Tatum, the unscrupulous reporter played by Kirk Douglas in Billy Wilder’s scabrous Ace In The Hole. It’s adolescent solipsism gone grotesquely rancid.",
    "It keeps you creeped out and fascinated.",
    "Rene Russo is spot-on as Nina, an aging TV news director who is the only person Bloom will sell his footage to.",
    "There’s a scolding tone to Nightcrawler that runs counter to its pulp energy, as if Gilroy is telling the audience to be alarmed by the things that turn them on. But much as Gilroy tries to be his own killjoy, Gyllenhaal’s wickedness prevails.",
    "Nightcrawler has patches of clunkiness, to be sure, and Lou’s face-off at a police station, near the end, feels graceless and unnecessary. Yet the movie is quite something, and, despite its title, it doesn’t really crawl.",
    "Like his erratic protagonist, Gilroy doesn’t always know when to settle down or call it quits, and the film’s constant shifts of tone can grow tiring, even if the action as a whole never gets boring.",
    "It’s a brilliant performance by Gyllenhaal in a film that veers from dark satire to tense crime thriller before the tires come off near the end, leaving the entire vehicle just short of worth recommending.",
    "Dan Gilroy's directorial debut only offers a familiar vision of today's newsman and producers as misery peddlers, and callow ratings slaves bordering on the monstrous.",
    "Nightcrawler is a slick and shallow movie desperate, like Lou himself, to be something more.",
    "It’s a pleasure to see Russo back on screen (she’s married to Gilroy). But Nina’s eager complicity is far too easy and every social critique flashes as bright as the neon guiding Lou around back-alley L.A.",
    "The film’s a satirical thriller, which is a novel enough entity in itself these days; it has a pungent, can’t-miss-the-point premise, and a big, weird, sharkish performance from Jake Gyllenhaal powering it up. It’s a must-see and a must-talk-about film, electrically overblown in the moment, if not wholly in control of its pay-off.",
    "By turning the loner Louis into a nutcase – if he blinked at all during the movie, I missed it – the movie becomes a species of horror film.",
    "Touches of apocalyptic comedy run throughout Nightcrawler, but the movie’s overriding tone is one of strident, finger-wagging self-seriousness.",
    "Nightcrawler, like its entrepreneurial-to-a-fault protagonist, is ambitious but ultimately hollow, eager to dazzle and shock us but reluctant to let us inside.",
    "After a few minutes you know everything about Louis you’re going to know; the only surprise in Nightcrawler is the level of grotesqueness it achieves. There’s more insight (and entertainment) in an average sketch from the old SCTV series; I kept imagining Joe Flaherty’s horror host Count Floyd climbing out of his coffin and chanting, “Oooh, that Louis, he’s veh-ry skerrrr-y, kiddies — ahwoooooooo!”"

However, one scene in the movie has some of the best editing and shots I've seen in an action scene in the past few years.\r Story is interesting and lets you dive into the intricacies of crime reporting in Los Angeles. There were some very minor things I would change to let the movie feel more sturdy near the end, but it felt complete.\r This is a movie you have to see. Gyllenhaal should be guaranteed an Oscar Nomination.",

The break-neck pace is all about being the first on the scene - murder, accidents, fires, mayhem - and selling the gratuitous footage to the local news stations. But the better he gets, the more likely he is going to become the next story.\r I heard so many great things about Nightcrawler. The critics said the same like, \"It's a flawless peace of entertainment\" or \"One of the best movie of the year\".- So I was looking forward to the movie by hearing all the good buzz from it, and after seeing it I can say that this movie is flawless.\r Jake Gyllenhaal gives one of his best performance he ever did in his career. He lost a lot of weight for this role and I can say it pays off so well. I love how he makes his character so creepy, but so interesting to watch on screen. I swear to god if he doesn't get a Oscar nomination for his performance in this movie, I will be angry and disappointed at the Oscars, because when I watch a movie and don't see the actor, just the character that right they is talent.\r The director of this movie (Dan Gilroy) and he was only a screenwriter for most of his career and this movie is his first time directing and my god his he brilliant. Dan Gilroy but a lot of effort in this movie and I heard that the director of the movie actually met some people who do these things that people call \"Nightcrawling\", and to me that shows that this guy should make more films in future, because he's the kind of director that movie need.\r The writing in this movie is some of the best writing I've seen since Boyhood, I mean every sentence in this movie glues me in it's story and character's. The move itself has that dark, uneasy and hash look to it, but that's life. The shots were good, the other cast member's were great as well.\r But as I said in my Interstellar and The Guest review, the movie isn't going to get the perfect rating of five out of five star's, but the movie is still brilliant.",

However, as long as one can over look the story's obvious absurdities it can be enjoyed as a compelling and superior thriller.\rJake Gyllenhaal is superb as the not unlikeable nutter who opportunistically decides to make a living by filming the misfortunes, injuries and death throes of others, which he then sells to TV. His total disdain for people and human life sets no bounds and this, in turn, leads him to TV news producer Renee Russo. She is fantastic as an ageing last chance producer who becomes entangled in his web. The scenes between them both literally crackle with there own kind of tension and are excellently written.\rThe movie, mainly shot at night, makes excellent use of its L. A. locations, and a couple of set pieces (a home invasion and a restaurant shoot out) are outstanding and demonstrate first rate examples of how to create sustained tension. Flying under the radar, this is a film not to be missed.",

Luckily, I was able toIn 2012, Aaron Sorkin piloted a television program that educated, informed and entertained by nit-picking the issues of modern day television broadcasting, information distribution and most of all, societal perception. Luckily, I was able to stumble upon a clip of the opening monologue of the show via YouTube, which was recommendation by a friend. The monologue, delivered by Will McAvoy, played by the audacious Jeff Daniels, is single handedly, one of the greatest monologues in television history, describing the issues with contemporary American politics, government, its people and most of all, the media. Approaching its third (and final) season, The Newsroom has proved to be a champion of debunking the public’s predictive perspective of hyped up terror scares, exploitation news broadcasting and television, as well as ginned up controversy.\r With Nightcrawler, writer/director Dan Gilroy feature film debut, the film delivers an almost complete counter-program to one of the best shows on television today, glorifying the exact same things The Newsroom is championing against. Yet, from the first dark scenes of trespassing to the final scenes of pure brutality and unimaginable corruption, Nightcrawler crawls up your skin and into our heads as one of the creepiest and feverishly uncomfortable films of 2014.\r Nightcrawler begins like any nightmare would, at night. Basked in the sketchy noir lights of an almost unrecognizable Los Angeles, similar to Newton Thomas Sigel’s Los Angles in Refn’s Drive, the night city is consumed by insomniacs and blood-thrity reporters looking to make money and a name for themselves based on the misfortunes and tragedies of others.\r One of those inhabitants is Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a fast-talking, quick learning creepy night-dweller who takes most of his knowledge and facts from the internet and disposes of his verbal jargon to anyone who crosses his path for his own interests. We first meet the Lou as a petty thief who cuts fences and steals manholes to make his money and earn a living. Bloom is a sociopath, and although we don’t immediately connect with the character, never once asking the questions of how, why and for how long he has been living this life, we never really question him either.\r After successfully trading his stolen possession to a local scrap metal owner, where he unsuccessfully bargains the terms of an employment position, Lou drives onto the barren freeway in his dilapidated car, stumbling across a car on fire. After pulling over and being mesmerized by the deadly ambers igniting on the hood on the destroyed vehicle, two news photographers crash the scenes with their nightly lit cameras and gear. Like we’ve seen before, Lou is no stranger to awkwardness, since he is as much an opportunist as he is a slimy insomniac, he offers his services to the ‘nightcrawler photographer’ Joe Loder (Bill Paxton). Rejected, Lou still feels that he has finally found his calling and with that, he steals an impressive racing bike on the Venice beach boardwalk in order to pay for a dodgy camcorder and cheap police scanner in order to begin his adventures as an amateurish nightcrawler.\r The film’s success can easily be accountable to its transformative star Jake Gyllenhaal, who lost over twenty pounds for the role by biking and running to set and reportedly spending up to eight hours a day at the gym. The actor, who has been nothing but superb in a recent string of stirring films from Prisoners, Enemy, End of Watch and Source Code, delivers one of his finest and easily most haunting performances to date. Complete with bulging eyes, an Adam’s apple and veins coursing the entirety of his body, Gyllenhaal proves that the simplest aesthetics are the scariest. Having no regard for human beings and enticing strangers with a jabber that is almost to quick to comprehend, Gyllenhaal’s dedication to the sketchy Bloom is seen both physically and emotionally, as well and felt cold-heartedly and abruptly by its audience.\r Bloom strives off hard work as he proves, despite his better concern for the law, he is a hustler. Convincing himself as well as everyone around him his potential in an industry that strives off trespassing, seduction and lies, Bloom manipulates everyone for his own regard. Reciting over the same lines, whether it be to a new employee of his company during a job interview to a desperate and homeless Rick (Riz Ahmed), or convincing low-rating news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo) of his potential of delivering graphic, unsavoury and somewhat illegal images for her morning broadcasts, Bloom believes that “If you want to win the lottery, you have to make the money to buy a ticket”, by any means possible. With-holding information to the police and pulling on the weaknesses of his prey, Bloom never thinks a second, making him one of the scariest, real people we never want to have the pleasure of meeting.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nTwo intoxicated old newsmen, a producer and the anchorman he just fired, in Network, nurse their last drinks at the bar, commiserating over the slipping standards of broadcast journalism. As a riposte to Howard Beale's avowal of an on-air suicide, in jest, the UBS news division head envisions The Death Hour, a weekly series whose content is wholly violent, wholly sensational. \"Suicides, assassinations, automobile smashups,\" Max jokingly brainstorms, never dreaming that his drunken ramblings outlining a telecast of blood-soaked spectacle would one day turn out to be an uncanny bit of prophetic extrapolation, a bar-lowering that allows somebody like Louis Bloom, a freelancing videographer, to be an invaluable media cog. Louis' bosses are death merchants, ratings-driven professionals who fulfill the UBS producer's longago pitch for a \"great Sunday night show for the whole family.\" Nightcrawler can be seen as the third film in an unofficial trilogy about the dumbing down of the news, the unassailable culmination of Beale's rant to the studio audience that television had supplanted books and newspapers as the primary medium of intellectual discourse. The penultimate film, Broadcast News, released a decade after Network, screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky's divination that entertainment value would eventually encroach on the erudite nature of hard news proved to be true, finds encapsulation in the scene where Jane Craig, a Washington bureau producer, sounds the alarm on broadcast news content when she presents a domino demonstration clip at a conference for local reporters. Whereas, in Network, the studio audience watching a degraded version of the news was the hoi polloi, denizens raised on Bugs Bunny, therefore rankling the old vanguard who still controlled the medium, in Broadcast News, we can see, quite pointedly, how the generation gap closed during the interim between both films. The Bugs Bunny aficionados were now the gatekeepers, industry insiders, who, to Jane's disappointment, are not \"mad as hell\" about the infiltration of fluff bombarding the airwaves, when the seminar attendees clap in approval after the final domino falls. At this juncture, the late-eighties, it would seem by the light-hearted genre(the rom-com) that is chosen to document the news program's fluid aspect in filmic amber, networks and their affiliates were, as of yet, not the whorehouses that Frank Hackett had purported UBS to be. Broadcast News ends on an optimistic note, a note suggesting that the trend could still be reversed. Tom Grunick, newly minted as the face of the news division, at his press conference, defers the programming duties to a civic-minded heavyweight. This conceit, in which a narcissist like the telegenic, yet uninformed newsman would be an advocate for hard copy that matters, now, in retrospect, seems more absurd than an anchorman being assassinated by network honchos because of low ratings. Tom is all about style over substance. Jane Craig doesn't exist anymore. Diana Christensen does. Once thought to be an implausible invention of a scribe with an overheated imagination, the bloodthirsty woman behind The Mao Tse Tung Hour, the UBS hit show documenting the terroristic maneuvers of the Ecumenical Liberation Army, lives on in Nina Romina, the news editor for a low-rated L.A. morning show, who embodies and widens Diana's vision of broadcast news as spectacle. Chayefsky, who would die in '81, never lived to see the ultra-violent direction that Hollywood would take; he never saw the big-budgeted studio films with high body counts, the count so high, audiences would become desensitized to the human collateral damage. In Bad Boys 2, neither we nor the filmmaker, in a chase scene between off-road vehicles, stop to consider the welfare of the Haitian peasants as the Hummer and Range Rover plow through their tarpaper shanties. Nightcrawler satirizes a different generation, The Terminator Generation, raised on the \"event movie\". Better than Man Bites Dog, the psuedo-doc about a film crew who follows a serial killer at work, Nightcrawler gets its message across about audience complicity towards violence because unlike the grainy B/W, cinema verite style of the Belgian import, the filmmaker uses the film language of the Hollywood blockbuster. Situated outside a glass-walled Chinese restaurant, Louis records a furious exchange of gunfire between the police and the suspects of a home invasion. The rectangular glass front, meant to represent a movie screen, provides a clue as to why people tune into the graphic imagery that apparently turns up on local mornings news shows in big cities. It's entertainment. It's The Death Hour. When Ben, in Man Bites Dog, murders an entire family in their home, we're horrified because it looks real. Here, violence, looks fun behind Louis' camera eye. Innocent bystanders die in the shootout, but we don't care. We've seen it in the movies.",

The main genius of the film is its protagonist. Jake Gyllenhaal's has one of his finest performances as the unwavering, sociopathic Leo Bloom, who is determined to climb to success, willing to do anything, regardless of the ethical, moral, or legal questions they may bring up. The script explores a whole new lens of how crime operates; not those ones who solve crimes, but those who broadcast it to us. It's intricate and like any great movie, it leaves you thinking long after you watch it.",

Death and destruction becomes headlines, \"each police siren wail equals a possible windfall, and victims\" are merely \"dollars and cents\" in the film \"Nightcrawler\".\r Lou Bloom is a hard-working man, a perfectionist, a fast-learner with a can-do attitude and an uncompromising work ethic. He's quite eloquent, articulate, and knowledgeable. He sounds like a nice guy, right? However, some people just don't know when to stop--when things have gone too far, out of hand, or crossed a line. Lou Bloom is one of those people. From tampering with crime scenes, to pressuring a co-worker for sex, to blackmailing and sabotaging others, to withholding information from authorities, to manipulating events to his advantage, Lou is an example of an opportunist who never stops pushing. He \"blurs the line between observer and participant\". Lou pursues the American Dream like countless other US citizens/residents--but he's simply willing to do anything to get his payday.\r The movie shows just how screwed up media can be. It’s competitive and ugly, with people fighting over the most gruesome footage. Nina primarily represents the ugly objectives of a cutthroat industry.***MILD SPOILERS*** When Nina discovers that a home invasion massacre was a drug deal gone wrong, she decides not to release that info (as it doesn’t go with the fear-instilling message she’s trying to tell). Nina also tells Lou to focus primarily on getting footage from wealthy, white neighborhoods, because that’s what the people want.\r Jake Gyllenhaal does an excellent performance as Lou. He's convincing as the socially awkward, demanding, and unsettling man. Jake shows effort, and he even lost weight for the role (which is evident with his gaunt cheekbones). Renne Russo is also great as Nina, a woman who also has little moral qualms with the faults of her work. Riz Ahmed's supporting character (Rick) could've had more of a backstory. I also happened to like Bill Paxton in his small role (as Joe, rival cameraman to Jake’s character Lou). Dan Gilroy does a great job as director, especially considering Nightcrawler is his first movie.\r Despite this praise, because Lou is presented as such a sociopath from the beginning, the movie has slightly less suspense toward the end than it could've had (in hindsight). However, the tragedy at the end is still unexpected to me.\r I have reviewed 38 other movies on Metacritic and IMDB, including the 2014 and 2015 films: Taken 3, The Interview, Exodus: Gods and Kings, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, Dracula Untold, The Maze Runner, The Equalizer, The Expendables 3, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Guardians of the Galaxy, The Giver, Sharknado 2, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Transformers: Age of Extinction, Edge of Tomorrow, X-Men Days of Future Past, Godzilla, Blended, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Divergent, Transcendence, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, The Lego Movie, and more.\r I review TV shows, such as: Empire (2015), The Flash, Arrow (Season 3), Gotham, The Last Ship (Season 1), Sleepy Hollow  (Season 1), Marvel's Agents of SHIELD (Season 1 and 2), The 100, I Wanna Marry Harry, Crisis, Gang Related, and more.

He likes to talk and he frequently tries to convince people that he’s a successful business man, a mover and shaker, who’s moving up in the world.

He said in a recent interview in regards to the film \"I don't think this experience will every completely go away\" and I would be surprised if it left him that easily. Gyllenhaal builds an extremely complex character, reminiscent of Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker in \"The Dark Knight\" in some ways. This performance is one of the best of the year and his character should be viewed as one of those that I am lucky enough to have seen on the big screen. Like Gylllenhaal I don't think that, for me, \"this experience will every go away.\"\r What I also found of interest was how the film made an insightful comment in regards to what today's media has become. This is something that I don't think the average viewer picks up, understanding that the media is this film is twisted looking to make money without principle nor wanting to inform people, the purpose of news (or rather what it should be...) \"Lou\" is this twisted monster, a personification of today's media. What I did notice was how Kevin Rahm (playing Frank Kruse) acts as the opposite this, standing up for these traditional principals and what news should be. The film does well to make this comment, something that I think most films should try to do, and it hits a fine line in regards to it, something that I think \"The Imitation Game\" didn't do in regards to homophobia and completely missed the boat on in regards to women rights (see my review on it).\r What I can criticise, and its worth noting I only do so because there always has to be some criticism with any film, in regards to \"Nightcrawler\" is how I found Riz Ahmed's inclusion (playing Rick) a bit unnecessary, the same with the film's ending. I find this in most films and I can never put a finger on it but in some ways I sympathised with the bastards next to me whispering \"why hasn't this film ended yet?\"  Its finally worth noting that Dan Gilroy makes his directorial debut with \"Nightcrawler\" and that explains some of the films flaws, but I'm not going to criticise him. I mean it his debut, and a bloody good one at that.\r \"Nightcrawler\" is a fantastic film and for me, Jack Glyenhaal was the highlight. 100% deserved of an Oscar Nomination, perhaps a win. What \"Nightcrawler\" made me realise though was how **** up our media is.",

After multiple rejections, Bloom, a keen observer, becomes involved by chance in the dark world of L.A. night crime “journalism” and discovers not only that he is fascinated by this sheer cirque du freak a.k.a. media, but also that he is very good at catching glimpses of human decadence and moral decay.\r Persistent and insidious by nature, Bloom crawls under the skin of an ethically challenged TV producer, Nina, played by Rene Russo, desperate to prove herself on top of her game. Their professional relationship quickly turns from a win-win situation into a personal and intimate (although the viewer never gets a direct proof in this respect, but only a couple of visual hints) power struggle, easily won by a scheming Bloom. And this is where Gilroy shows his masterful directing eye through clean cut close-ups and narrow camera angles that manage to catch the characters’ body language and facial expressions: a sneaky reptilian Bloom and an arrogant feline like Nina – both creatures of the night.\r Bloom is not at all a sociopath as he might come across at a first glance. He is just a striver, an over-achiever who lacks any kind of conscience or feelings and is willing to literary step on dead bodies and who is not so different from any climber on the corporate or social ladder. He’s manipulative and a very good salesman, not bound by any moral constraints and thus, anyone who comes into contact with him becomes an instant prey. Bloom is a by-product of today’s society that tries to spit him out at first, only to become his playground later, and to a certain extent he is the embodiment of the American dream.\r “Nightcrawler” is an obvious satire, but it never preaches or moralizes. It observes through a lens and lets the viewer grasp whatever he will out of this contorted monster.\r Gilroy knows how to build up tension and keep up the suspense by alternating quiet wide shots with fast paced action scenes. His directorial debut is reminiscent of Nicolas Winding Refn’s “Drive” and “Only God Forgives”, a sort of a “neon cinema” product that casts a spell on the viewer through its raw lawlessness and haunting soundtrack. But unlike Ryan Gosling in “Drive”, Gilroy’s Bloom is an anti-hero that you loathe from the first frame (maybe except for the few times when you see him carefully wetting the only sign of life in his shadowy spartan apartment – a plant). Jake Gyllenhaal is annoyingly fascinating in his creation of Bloom and the movie’s brilliance is largely due to his Oscar worthy performance. With wide bulging eyes and a head that seems almost too big for his skinny and slightly gibbous frame, Gyllenhaal shows how much he immersed himself into the creepy crawling Bloom. Gyllenhaal seems poised to win his first Oscar nomination for a lead role with “Nightcrawler”, but even if that doesn’t happen he sure managed to hone one of the most despicable yet memorable cinematic anti-heroes in recent years.\r “Nightcrawler” is a must-seen, definitely worth the ticket money and your attention, especially for the haunting intensity of Gyllenhaal’s performance.",

Or that I liked Lou Bloom. As someone suggested at dinner afterwards, he may be a sociopath like Charles Manson or Hannibal Lecter, but at least Hannibal Lecter had a sense of humor and so some self-knowledge. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an Oscar-worthy performance and is always in character and completely convincing. The analogy to Manson may be apt since Manson supposedly (and ironically) got his start in manipulation by reading Dale Carnegie’s classic  book “How to Win Friends and Influence People.” Bloom has taken business courses online and learned only to be ruthless. He also reminded me of Bartleby the Scrivener in that his own desires and will came before anyone else’s. Nightcrawler is a fascinating film, and I wasn’t bored for a second, watching the diabolical Bloom become a \"success\" in the amoral world of sensational broadcast journalism where ratings are the only thing that count – a world worthy of Bloom’s cold and clinical view of life.",

Finally a director gave us a unique approach at newsroom entertainment in today's 'I want it now mentality'. Jake Gyllenhaal was memorizing and Rene Russo was at her best giving us an insight of newsroom activity and what today's hot stories and how they are portrayed along at what costs News-directors are willing to pay to have them revealed.

In the words of Lou Bloom “A friend is a gift you giveNIGHTCRAWLER – JUST WOW – WHAT A MOVIE. Jake Gyllenhaal is my pick for Best Male Actor Oscar this year and the movie deserves a nomination, as does first time director, Dan Gilroy. In the words of Lou Bloom “A friend is a gift you give yourself” – this movie is your friend!\r Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a loner, a dedicated and passionately driven loner. He has absolutely no friends and spends his time by himself, learning a vast amount of skills on the internet or stealing items to sell. He desperately wants love (or his idea of love) and a job with a steady income. His social skills are based on what he has learned online, as such, he has no social graces or knowledge. He speaks like a text book and is void of emotion and a path to live on. He tries asking for jobs and selling himself to various places but he has no luck, until he sees a fascinating and bloody piece of inspiration. He could become someone who works for himself and gets a reward if he does the job well, that of a nightcrawler, overnight freelance trash journalism. The stuff that trash TV news wants a piece of, the darkest of society at its worse. You all love seeing a train wreck, you know you shouldn’t watch but you can’t take your eyes off it. Lou films it and sells it to TV for you to watch over your morning breakfast. But as a freelancing job there are other freelancers and if you want your item sold you need to have the best footage, what would you, or in this case, Lou do to get the best sellable footage?\r Lou is a vampire, a manipulative murderous vampire, he is terrifying in his matter of fact speak, unpredictable and unstoppable, could it turn into a serial killer movie? Lou is another train wreck you can’t take your eyes off, while his delivery is humorous his belief in himself and the world is beyond freakish, the worst part, people like him probably exist.\r Lou meets KLWA night news editor, ruthless, trash TV editor, Nina Romina (Rene Russo), who he sells his footage to exclusively. Romina is at the end of her career tether and knows that train wrecks will sell and get people viewing. In Nina Romina’s own words describing the ideal footage “a screaming woman, running down the street with her throat cut,” she says, and Lou is willing to go the extra distance to get it for her. It’s a match made in television hell.\r At the start Nina views Lou as a simple determined guy, the new kid on the block who may have some good footage. But their relationship grows into much more.\r Russo’s husband, writer/ director Dan Gilroy has delivered a fresh and nuanced screenplay and delivered it on a golden platter with his debut movie. The unintentional wit and candour of Lou is reminiscent of Norman Bates and Frank. Gyllenhaal provides a dedicated tour de force with his performance. He was so dedicated to the role, he worked out eight hours a day and rode his cycle to set to lose weight as he wanted to be a “hungry coyote,” he also was so involved in the “mirror” scene he ended up in hospital getting his hand stitched, he then came straight back to set.\r The supporting cast of Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed and Bill Paxton is the icing on the cake for this movie, they were all perfectly cast and perfectly delivered their characters. All of these characters have a small but pivotal piece on Lou’s chessboard and it all comes through onscreen, there is never too much nor too little delivered. That being said I always want more Paxton onscreen, he plays such a great character in this, he could have his own movie. And Russo is still one woman I would turn for, ever since LETHAL WEAPON 3 I have crushed on her, I never thought she could do a trashy and desperate look, an aging and needy power woman, and she does, while slowly falling into Lou’s world of insanity.\r Academy Award Winner Robert Elswit’s cinemtography is the cherry on top of that icing on this glorious cake of a movie. It has a definite Scorcese look and feel to it. The seedy undertones and dark moodiness of Los Angeles created by Elswit have never felt so unappealing, it literally is a hunting ground for Lou. At the same time the colours are all striking, to match the increased sight by Lou's large \"all-seeing\" eyes, eyes that Gyllenhaal rarely blinks - he did the same thing in DONNIE DARKO.\r NIGHTCRAWLERS' satirical dark comedic thrilling look at paparazzi styled freelance guerrilla journalism is at times hilarious and at others terrifying. This is the closest film to Scorcese's BRINGING OUT THE DEAD I have seen. It is an amazing piece of cinema for film lovers, this is not for the family or date night. Gyllenhall for Oscar!",

Although opening on or about Halloween eve, and with a suggestive title lending itself to that ritual, the film is actually the story of those vulture-like papparazzi who, instead of following celebs in innocent daily real life situations, seek to capture the tragedies and \"breaking news\" stories that besiege our evening news each night. In the mid 20th Century, these photo journalists would freelance and sell their wares to the highest newspaper bidder. Now, in the era of television and video and digital photography, the suppliers become video camera operators and the bidders are the news directors of local tv stations.\rAs so ably portrayed by Mr. Gyllenhaal, the film tells the story of one such video cameraman and the lengths and extremes he will go to \"get the shot\" or \"capture the video\". It also depicts his enablers in the newsrooms of Los Angeles who empower and enable these \"nightcrawlers\" to reap the economic benefits of their endeavors. The film is well paced and will hold your interest and involvement and makes its point in an artistic although not too subtle a manner.

The film suffers from an uneven voice and bad pacing which all could have been corrected by an expert editor. NIGHTCRAWLER needs an objective eye to whip it into shape. But enough of the negative. So much is so good and the film is full of surprises from the performances to its depiction of LA. Incidentally, about 90% of this film is shot like 50 feet from our house. I can only think of one other film that captured the \"real\" LA so closely and that is THE MORNING AFTER. This is the real LA. Not the reel LA. I don't want to give it away but I so appreciate that the sleaze factor is kept in check and actually feels like the real world rather than an over amped sizzle reel.

The film is bolstered by Gyllenhaal's performance which is electrifying, unpredictable and extraordinary. I'm holding out hope for an Oscar nomination, even if his superb work in recent years (i.e. Zodiac, Prisoners) has gone unrecognised by the Academy. His work here is more than deserving to buck the trend - I was left hanging on every word that came out of his mouth, dripping in guile and insanity. He's backed up by a strong supporting cast. Rene Russo stands out as the station manager who becomes Louis's biggest client for his footage. Her work is similarly Oscar-calibre and she shows her character's insecurities and vulnerabilities with subtlety and grace, doing a particularly good job of showing simultaneously the shock at Louis's moral decline and her dependence at the rejuvenation his footage is giving her career. Dan Gilroy's alternately disturbing and exciting and surprisingly funny (in parts) script deftly handles its character's amorality and the exploration of the way media and crime are becoming closely intertwined.\r 'Nightcrawler' owes a lot of its frenetic, adrenaline-rush spirit to its technical work, particularly John Gilroy's editing and writer Dan Gilroy's directing - it's sleek, it's crisp, it's energetic, it works wonderfully with Gyllenhaal's acting to gradually push you to the edge of your seat so that by the nail-biting final act, you're practically falling into the aisle. The road scenes in 'Nightcrawler' are especially good, boasting some of the most brilliant camerawork I've seen this year. Its strongly reminiscent stylistically and visually of Nicolas Winding Refn's masterpiece 'Drive', especially in the way its more action-oriented scenes are shot and the way it handles its L.A. scenery. Robert Elswit, a skilled veteran of cinematography whose work dazzles me on P.T. Anderson features, deserves credit for his gorgeous landscape shots of the city in 'Nightcrawler.'\r It's everything I could want in a thriller and it's well worth the watch. One of the year's most demented and brilliant films, 'Nightcrawler' is something special in the canon of crime thriller and deserves all the recognition it can get.",

Louis Bloom (Gyllenhaal) is down on his luck, he drives an old car, lives in an disgusting apartment, and doesn't have a job. He drives around at night looking for ways to earn money, when he comes across a film crew taping a crime scene. It seems like easy money, so Bloom goes out, gets a camera, and starts filming the police himself, only, he doesn't follow the same rules that the others do.

Louis Bloom is this O.C.D. guy, who is constantly rambling and talking to himself, something that basically ruins the whole film. This guy gets so annoying it's to the point of frustrating. On top of that, it takes a long time for anything substantial to happen. I was really looking forward to seeing this film and was impressed by how far Jake Gyllenhaal has come, but despite it's looming cult classic label, I found this film to just be one frustrating scene after another. Critics are willing to give films like this four stars and tell you it's a must see, because of an Oscar worthy performance, but what's really the point of seeing something that most people aren't going to want to sit through?

And Gyllenhaal is good, just not the amount of good the reviewers are claiming.",

After last year’s one-two punch PRISONERS (2013, 8/10) and ENEMY (2013, 8/10), NIGHTCRAWLER is screenwriter Dan Gilroy’s director debut, set in L.A., the title refers to hired hands who usually drift at night, as soon as any accident or crime happens, they will rush to the scene and take lurid photos and videos, then sell them to the local media for highest bid. Gyllenhaal’s Louis Bloom is one of them, he is so good at it and professes that he is born to do this job, what’s more chilling is that he is a callous sociopath with no moral boundary, even more shockingly is the society not only condones him, but encourages and rewards him bountifully.\r continue reading my review on my blog, google: cinema omnivore, thanks",

The whole thing. the suspension of belief for this film just left me in the dust. I am not even in the law enforcement or news industries and I can tell you this guy would not be walking the streets if this had anything to do with any kind of reality.

His motivation multiple-leveled all of which is believable. When he sees an opportunity to shape events for mutual benefit within the confides of criminal law he chooses to ignore moral law to achieve his goals.\r Looking further into the story of this flick I feel it represents the requirements and expectations forced upon us to be ruthless sociopathic people in the aim of 'success'.

While Gyllenhaal gives it his all in what some would consider the most compelling performance of his career, I never entirely bought into his character because he was essentially an amalgam of every other brooding, reclusive sociopath in cinema history, and he was all too familiar a character to even remotely pique my interest. Nightcrawler is a film that teeters uncomfortably between being realistic and illogical throughout, with vague social commentary jammed somewhere in between. It seemed like the score was absent for over half the movie's duration, but it flutters in occasionally (and awkwardly, I might add) to remind the audience of its existence. Director Dan Gilroy also demands that the audience revel in the inhumanity depicted on screen, and is so focused upon unsettling the audience, that any message he may be trying to convey is completely diluted by this forced grittiness. This film pales in comparison to Gone Girl in all respects.",

Scenarios are intense as we watch our lead Gyllenhaal run into dangerous situations that could land him in prison or in the grave. His motives aren't exactly disagreeable, but his methods are. The movie has a lot to say about modern journalism tactics.\r The whole film succeeds thanks to how well the character Louis Bloom is written and how well he is portrayed by Gyllenhaal who gives another fantastic performance. He is a character who is equally creepy, brilliant, deranged, and likable. It's this combination that makes the character do things you won't agree with, but still keep you rooting for him at the same time.\r I have to give special praise for how the film is shot. The gritty, almost grainy look of the world makes it look like one of those crime-thrillers from the 80's. For my fellow gamers out there I guess you could compare it's look to that of Hotline Miami. It gives the film a touch of a retro vibe.\r \"Nightcrawler\" is dark, creepy, and at times vicious. It's a lot like it's protagonist in that respect. It's a wild and smart ride.
