  "title": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes",
  "rating": 8.2,
  "release_date": "2014-07-11",
  "summary": "A growing nation of genetically evolved apes led by Caesar is threatened by a band of human survivors of the devastating virus unleashed a decade earlier. They reach a fragile peace, but it proves short-lived, as both sides are brought to the brink of a war that will determine who will emerge as Earth's dominant species.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The film forges ahead, in vivid 3-D, with such energy, expertise and thunderous conviction that you readily accept its basic premise — the pell-mell emergence of great intelligence, plus moral awareness, in primitive bodies — and find yourself exactly where the filmmakers want you to be, swinging giddily between sympathy for the apes and the humans in what threatens to become all-out war.",
    "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is awe-inspiring.",
    "Yet for all of the technological genius at work here, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes maintains a remarkably human core, even under digital makeup.",
    "\"Dawn\" is not just a good genre movie or a good summer movie. It's a great science-fiction film, full-stop, and one of the year's very best movies so far.",
    "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes manages to do at least three things exceptionally well that are hard enough to pull off individually: Maintain a simmering level of tension without let-up for two hours, seriously improve on a very good first entry in a franchise and produce a powerful humanistic statement using a significantly simian cast of characters.",
    "An altogether smashing sequel to 2011′s better-than-expected “Rise of the Planet of the Apes,” this vivid, violent extension of humanoid ape Caesar’s troubled quest for independence bests its predecessor in nearly every technical and conceptual department.",
    "Director Matt Reeves, working from a script by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver and Mark Bomback, elevates the apes to primary importance in this intelligent thriller.",
    "In truth, the deeply absorbing and thematically rich ‘Apes’ sequel is more akin to a drama than an action film, but it's one that still satisfies the desires and demands of big, blockbuster filmmaking.",
    "“Dawn” is more than a bunch of occasionally thrilling action sequences, emotional gut punches and throwaway jokes arranged in predictable sequence. It is technically impressive and viscerally exciting, for sure, but it also gives you a lot to think, and even to care, about.",
    "Serkis’ Caesar gets more than his fair share of rip-snortin’ badass moments. He’s arguably the finest leader of men we’ve seen on screen since “Lincoln.”",
    "Loud, smart and ferociously committed to its premise, and it leaves an intriguingly bitter aftertaste.",
    "This installment inches events closer to a merge point with 1968's \"Planet of the Apes\" while maintaining its own unique identity. It is in every way superior to \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes.\"",
    "Good news – it’s incredible. It sets the standard for blockbuster action movies, and manages to be even better than its predecessor.",
    "This is an “Apes” for the ages.",
    "It's a provocative sci-fi action film with dynamite special effects, a powerful humanistic theme with echoes of real-life social conflicts, and a truly wondrous performance by Serkis.",
    "For two hours of breathless drama, you forget you’re watching actors grunting like chimps and hope two rival civilizations can work together.",
    "What’s striking about this new film is that it lays out the message-mongering in such a way that you can enjoy the movie equally well on a purely action level.",
    "It speaks to the masses with some treats for the discerning types in the back.",
    "A sequel that easily tops its 2011 predecessor.",
    "A satisfying balance of family drama, political intrigue and all-out action (an ape cavalry charge has to be seen to be believed) do, in truth, only constitute half of the story, as Reeves' sci-fi sequel is as much a technical triumph as a narrative one.",
    "A superbly mounted, powerfully performed, if slightly underfed Apes sequel. That Reeves is set to direct Untitled Of The Planet Of The Apes next is cause for much celebration. This guy’s fur real. No pun intended.",
    "Even given the spate of post-apocalyptic and dystopian films that rule the multiplexes, this is the bleakest “franchise” in human history, and I’m curious if there will be any balm whatsoever in the next close encounter of the furred kind.",
    "Makes for riveting viewing. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is among the more brisk 2 hours and 10 minutes I've spent in a theater in some time -- and it's easily the most rewarding of this year's summer tentpole films.",
    "Yet for all the heady ideas at play, Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes remains a visceral film, one of movement, action, unexpected developments, and disarming poignance.",
    "Eschewing a tidy wrap-up, Reeves doesn't leave us feeling manipulated, as so often happens in films like this. Instead, we want to know where the story goes from here, and that's no small accomplishment.",
    "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a much better and far less silly movie than its predecessor.",
    "Not quite the intimate parable of the first movie nor a balls-to-the-wall battlefield extravaganza, Dawn is pitched somewhere in the middle, with much of its two hour-plus running time powered by the simmering, expertly sustained tension both between and within the two species.",
    "Just as 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes surpassed expectations, so this sequel delivers on its promise and leaves us wanting more – which we'll almost certainly get.",
    "It may lack its predecessor’s lofty ambitions, but once the bullets, spears and hairy fists start flying you’ll be too wrapped up to care.",
    "There's evident patience and intelligence to the filmmaking all over, as well as an engagement with genuine ideas about diplomacy, deterrence, law and leadership. However often it risks monkey-mad silliness, it's impressively un-stupid.",
    "The narrative and its attendant lessons about how one rotten ape and/or human can spoil the bunch are engaging, although I found myself drifting during the battle sequences.",
    "The apes and the special effects team are the real stars of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.",
    "Visually, this movie is big, bold, often awe-inspiring.",
    "In one of the most wickedly funny scenes in sci-fi history, Koba uses monkeyshines to bamboozle some gun-toting yahoos and scuttle the peace treaty.",
    "Whatever audiences think of it, I'd say the latest \"Apes\" picture is just that: a solid success, sharing many of its predecessor's swift, exciting storytelling and motion-capture technology virtues.",
    "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes works both as allegory and action-adventure film. The internecine conflict between apes mirrors the troubled history of our own race.",
    "Dawn is dynamite entertainment, especially in the rousing first hour.",
    "An action-packed epic, a moving sci-fi allegory rendered in broad, lush strokes by the latest state of the computer animator’s art.",
    "This is a summer blockbuster contingent on grand bargains, tactical retreats, and a ferocious, inevitable shock-and-awe campaign.",
    "What is missing from the film is wit—the deep wit that comes from playing off species and environments against each other.",
    "When it gets going, it’s a pretty fine movie.",
    "\"Dawn's\" vision of masses of intelligent apes swarming the screen as masters of all they survey is even more impressive than it was the last time around and reason enough to see the film all by itself.",
    "Yet for all the heart and soul the actor pours into his role, watching Dawn still feels a bit like seeing massive, expensive wheels spin in place.",
    "At a certain point in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, you expect Caesar to say, \"Et tu, Koba?\" Maybe a bit obvious, but it would have shown some wit.",
    "For its few visual and many script flaws, however, director Matt Reeves (“Cloverfield,” “Let Me In”) balances the splashy set pieces with quieter moments (sullen teen Kodi Smit-McPhee gives a copy of Charles Burns’ “Black Hole” to a wise orangutan named after Maurice Evans!) in such a way that “Dawn” never feels dull or draggy.",
    "If you see the movie, notice how the ending is no ending, and the fact that it even feels like one is entirely a function of Michael Giacchino's musical score.",
    "Watching an army of apes riding horses heading into battle is undeniably cool, but that’s the only thing the movie gives you: Neat eye candy. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is written at a level so low, even 8- year-olds will find it lacking.",
    "Any film that begins with one of those fake-news montages, where snippets of genuine CNN footage are stitched together to concoct a feeling of semi-urgency around its hackneyed apocalypse, already sucks even before it gets started."

An emotionally heavy and truly moving film, Dawn is an absolute marvel of modern science fiction, building upon the strong and unmovable foundations Rise of the Planet of the Apes had left earlier. With a plethora of solid characters from both ends of the tale, an explosive sequence of events and a rather poetic script, Dawn raises the bar for the Planet of the Apes franchise and other big-budget philosophical productions of it's caliber. Dawn really is something that deserves appreciation; few films in our day can only dream of achieving what Dawn has. A film that truly touches it's audience with heartfelt passion and remorse for humanity, Dawn is the kind of film that films as an art form and the film industry needs in general.\r Both Rise and Dawn are thought provoking; films that challenge our perception of our very own species through another. However, Dawn triumphs more spectacularly in a way few films before it had done so; through unsolicited and unforced emotion and depth that makes Dawn a true modern science fiction classic, something that the original creators of Planet of the Apes would be very proud of.",

Smart and impeccably well crafted, this installment's first half is a little weak at times, but the second half is unmatchedThese new age Planet of the Apes films continue to deeply impress with me with equal parts brawn, brain, and beauty. Smart and impeccably well crafted, this installment's first half is a little weak at times, but the second half is unmatched in recent times from war films. Honestly, this and its first installment have to be some of the best war films of this decade and up there for this century as a whole. Director Matt Reeves picks up where Rupert Wyatt left off with a beautifully poetic and stunningly crafted film about Caesar and the apes. Mirroring foreign politics on the brink of war in real life, all of those same problems and confusions are represented here with a deeply human and moving film the result. Neither side is good, neither side is bad. Instead, it is one big shade of gray with plenty of confusion on both sides. The cinematography and score are once more incredible. The special effects are fantastic and the fight choreography incredibly impressive. Many modern day blockbusters lack weight and an air of importance and \"epicness\". This one has it all in spades with a truly incredible film that packs a true emotional punch due to the trauma that can come from misunderstandings. Once again, the modern day Planet of the Apes delivers.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nAs an unashamed fan of the original Planet of the Apes films (which I once picked up for under a fiver), I am more than happy to enjoy this Sequel to the Reboot of the Remake of the Planet of the Apes. What’s been delivered is another entertaining film; almost, but not quite the equal of its predecessor, with a decent story and characters, and special effects at the top of their game.\r An expedition of humans has ventured deep into ape territory with the intention of restarting a hydroelectric dam to restore power to the ruins of San Francisco. With a deep mistrust of humans at the very core of ape doctrine, the plan becomes a tense diplomatic mission as the humans and apes negotiate to avoid another brutal conflict and needless loss of life.\r Caesar is played by master of motion capture Andy Serkis and amazingly, the motion capture was largely filmed on location in the forests of Vancouver, the CGI seamlessly integrated with live action. As a character, Caesar is rare among apes in that he was raised by a human and can see the good in them.\r Our human hero is Malcolm (Jason Clarke), a survivalist and engineer, who is in charge of the expedition, but is not much of a leader. Neither is he a diplomat, but he is level headed enough to develop a relationship with Caesar, with whom they share a common goal which transcends the interspecies squabble – each has a family they would do anything to protect.\r The real leader of the humans is back in San Francisco: the militaristic but pragmatic Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) who has already lost his family (he swipes through their pictures on a prominently placed iPad – in shops now!) and has little desire to understand or relate to the apes.\r The previous director Rupert Wyatt is replaced here by Matt Reeves, who gave us found footage monster movie Cloverfield, where the tantalising excitement of citywide destruction just off-screen was undermined by the idiotic decisions made by the protagonists. There are shades of this frustrating characterisation here with one member of Malcolm’s team, Carver.\r He is nothing more than a catalyst; right from the opening scene, where he shoots first and thinks later, wounding Caesar’s son Blue Eyes in the process, everything about him screams “I’m the **** who’s constantly going to jeopardise this fragile diplomacy” – which is barely saved from the brink of collapse more than once before the inevitable final showdown.\r Koba fills this role for the apes, but he is a stronger character and an established personal rival of Caesar, who tries to corrupt the younger apes, including Cesar’s impressionable young son Blue Eyes.\r We also remember the dramatic “No!” – The first words spoken by an ape in both Conquest and Rise, when Caesar flexes his vocal chords to deliver an ultimatum to the humans, but the apes here tend to converse in sign language amongst themselves. Perhaps they see spoken language as a hallmark of humanity, but they prefer to save their English skills to dramatically intimidate humans, reminding them that they share a level of intelligence which apes may even have surpassed with their sense of community. While the apes have built a new society from the ground up, the surviving humans continue to scavenge in the ruins of their decaying civilisation, relying on old technology.\r There’s a great scene about halfway through the film. Power is restored to an old petrol station in the woods, and as it flickers into life a song plays from a stereo: The Weight by The Band, a song which is both religious allegory and an exploration of the music which flows from the American South. Its thematic relevance extends to include references to Judgement Day and the American civil rights movement.\r Hearing recorded music and seeing artificial light, symbolic of humanity’s legacy, offers a spot of hope, which is inevitably undercut by the melancholy of the world lost and the inevitability of an impending finale, which I’m going to talk about now, so stop reading to avoid spoilers. Hey, I’ve already told you that they managed to get the power back on so Gary Oldman can charge his iPad.\r The audience wants a fight, we’ve paid to see apes with machine guns, and a fight is what we get, courtesy of the hot headed Koba and unrelenting Dreyfus. Lamentably although hell inevitably breaks loose, credibility is stretched. The previously pacifist apes are far too good at using the machine guns they have only recently stolen from the humans.\r We know the apes have both intelligence and physical strength on their side, but it’s hard to explain hold their own so well against the trained human guards. Ultimately, they overwhelm the humans with sheer numbers, when they might have concocted a strategic assault using some kind of unique and established ape advantage, such as their non verbal communication, or climbing ability.",

What that film started to explore - human nature and animal instinct and how frighteningly closely those two things intersect - is looked at more in-depth and given a heightened sense of urgency in Dawn of the Planet of the Ape's post-apocalyptic context.

It chronicles the relationship between the human survivors and a group of genetically modified apes led by Caesar. Through the evolution of the narrative events occur that leave the human survivors and the apes on the brink of war.\r The cast includes Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, and the wonderful returning Andy Serkis as Caesar. The acting is in all regard good, but where it truly shines is in the scenes where Clarke's character is interacting with Caesar. The chemistry between the two leads is compelling, thrilling, and aw inspiring. Particularly due to Andy Serkin's phenomenal video capture work. Gary Oldman is also fantastic, (per usual) and no actor's presence seems to detract from the film.\r Director Matt Reeves is one of the undeniable factors that makes 'Dawn' so great. Reeves direction is smart, intuitive, and filled with dozens of engaging shots. Reeves hits the mark with almost every frame and this greatly affects the overall intensity and emotion of the film. The screenplay is also admirable for creating memorable dialogue even if some of it fells like exposition.\r 'Dawn' also exceeds in exhibiting interesting social commentary throughout. The film presents themes of racial tension in intellectual ways and this is greatly appreciated due to the much-needed depth it adds. These social messages help to create a great deal social relevancy propelling the film past just great Si-Fi.\r Dawn of the Planet of the Apes improves over its predecessor in almost every way. From the stellar direction to the social commentary, 'Dawn\" exceeds the summer blockbuster template to construct a film that is truly relevant while also being extremely entertaining.",

      "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes takes place ten years after the first and much has changed. Caesar(played by Andy Serkis) returns as the ape leader in an even better performance than the original with the support of his returning ape friendsDawn of the Planet of the Apes takes place ten years after the first and much has changed. Caesar(played by Andy Serkis) returns as the ape leader in an even better performance than the original with the support of his returning ape friends Maurice and Koba. Caesar now has a family, including his rebellious son Blue Eyes, his wife, and newborn son. Caesar’s companion, Will Rodman(played by James Franco) has died, which introduces the new cast. Jason Clarke, Keri Russell, Gary Oldman, and many more amazing new characters that are trying to survive in the rundown city of San Francisco. The Apes are growing in numbers and strength, while the majority of humans are either dead from the simian flu or each other. Caesar is now in charge of the apes and only wants what’s best for his kind, but Koba, Caesar’s right hand man, has other ideas. When the humans and apes try to work together Koba ruins every chance for peace through violence. A war between apes and humans is inevitable and nothing can stop what is to come, not even Caesar.\rThis movie hits in all the right places. The visuals are astounding. The contrast from the lush green forests and the dilapidated San Francisco makes for a great setting, and the way it’s filmed cannot be understated. The way in which the intense battle sequences are filmed, set this movie apart from every other action blockbuster. In one sequence the camera is rotated an entire 360 degrees revealing the destruction of humans and apes at war, which makes for the most dramatic scene in the entire movie. The CGI integration is seamless, especially when so many apes appear at once alongside humans. The loss of James Franco doesn’t even phase this cast, every character has a purpose and it shows on-screen. The beautiful script is heard not only with the human cast, but the apes too. They speak less, but do when necessary, and it is breathtaking just as it was in the first film.\rDawn of the Planet of the Apes surpasses it’s predecessor, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, in every way. The characters, the cinematography, and plot are all impressively intriguing. This is the best blockbuster of the year, and great fun for the entire family. The only downfall is that this movie isn’t an IMAX 3D Experience.",

Then again, this is a planet of the apes movie. The first of these ended with a lecture on how we'll destroy the planet. So being depressing isn't exactly a surprise. But anyway, let's talk about the apes. Caesar was the best character because he had the most depth. Krona was also a good villain because he was really complex. Gary Oldman's character was interesting too. He obviously has a tragic past, and there's one scene where you feel sorry for him but at the same time, he's prepared to destroy the apes even when one of his own people tries to tell him that they aren't truly evil.

      "content": "‘Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ Continues the Saga.\r A quick montage at the beginning of “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” fills us in on what has happened since “Rise of the Planet of the Apes.” Three years have gone by for us in the‘Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ Continues the Saga.\r A quick montage at the beginning of “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” fills us in on what has happened since “Rise of the Planet of the Apes.” Three years have gone by for us in the audience, and about a decade for the assorted primates on the screen. James Franco and millions of other people are dead, victims of a lethal virus and the usual apocalypse-causing disease of hubris. After a period of violence and chaos, the survivors have cobbled together a reasonably stable society in the ruins of San Francisco, with Gary Oldman in charge.\r But this is not “Dusk of the Planet of the Humans.” The spectacle of yet another desperate population, huddled together in the wake of catastrophe to await the next zombie, alien, robot or monster attack, would be unlikely to inspire much excitement. The real interest lies across the battered Golden Gate Bridge, in Marin County, where our evolutionary cousins, under the benevolent guidance of an upright-walking chimpanzee named Caesar, have built their own civilization. In contrast to the bedraggled human colony, the ape encampment is a thriving city-state with distinctive wooden architecture, domesticated horses, a sophisticated (mostly signed) language and an educational system overseen by Maurice, the gentle, copper-furred orangutan who gave the first movie an extra fillip of soul.\r The sylvan, simian Athens in the Muir Woods is a remarkable achievement and an important part of what makes “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,” directed by Matt Reeves from a script by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver and Mark Bomback, the best of this summer’s large-scale, big-studio franchise movies. Granted, this isn’t a very high bar to clear: “better than ‘Transformers 4’ ” barely counts as praise, even with an exclamation mark. But unlike that toy-smashing extravaganza — and unlike 2014’s visitations from the “Spider-Man,” “X-Men” and “Godzilla” money trains — “Dawn” is more than a bunch of occasionally thrilling action sequences, emotional gut punches and throwaway jokes arranged in predictable sequence. It is technically impressive and viscerally exciting, for sure, but it also gives you a lot to think, and even to care, about.\r Starting with the apes themselves. In the final credits, Andy Serkis receives top billing for his performance as Caesar, a role that continues to redefine screen acting in the digital age. His facial expressions and body language are so evocatively and precisely rendered that it is impossible to say where his art ends and the exquisite artifice of Weta Digital, the special-effects company, begins. The same is true of the other main ape performers: Karin Konoval (Maurice); Nick Thurston (Caesar’s son Blue Eyes); Judy Greer (Caesar’s wife, Cornelia); and especially Toby Kebbell as Koba, Caesar’s lieutenant and eventual nemesis.\r Koba, a survivor of scientific experiments, bears the physical and moral scars of human cruelty. When the apes encounter a scouting party from the city (led by Jason Clarke and Keri Russell), Koba is quick to sound the alarm. The humans, about to run out of fuel, want to restore an abandoned hydroelectric station in ape territory, and they ask Caesar for help. Koba warns that people are a violent, duplicitous, predatory species that should be fought if it can’t be avoided.\r Caesar, who saw the generous, tender side of humanity when he was hanging out with Mr. Franco and Freida Pinto, is willing to give our kind the benefit of the doubt. There is plenty of evidence — both in the movie and beyond it — to support Koba’s view, but the film comes down squarely, and maybe a little too squishily, on the side of tolerance and cooperation. The ape and human societies are parallel primitive patriarchies (women nurture and worry, while men lead and fight, a disappointing but hardly surprising failure of imagination on the filmmakers’ part), and they are threatened by symmetrical schisms. As Koba opposes Caesar, so does Malcolm (Mr. Clarke’s character) find himself increasingly at odds with Dreyfus (Mr. Oldman), who sees the apes as a mortal threat to be confronted with maximum brutality.\r And while “Rise” found room for exuberance in the shadow of catastrophe — partly because it seemed so justifiably excited by its own ingenuity — “Dawn,” its title notwithstanding, paints a darker, scarier picture of the future. It also has a grave, brooding beauty, intensified by Michael Giacchino’s wild and subtle score and by the deep, verdant shadows of Michael Seresin’s cinematography. Mr. Reeves has a fine sense of visual detail and also of the eloquence of nonverbal exchanges between characters, digitally enhanced and otherwise. (Ms. Russell and Kodi Smit-McPhee, as her adolescent son, do especially graceful work in limited roles.) The film is full of small, memorable moments and crowded with distinctive personalities on both sides of the ape-human divide.",

Now humans are a minority, a race facing extinction (what an irony!) that apes seem to be able to seriously threaten. The contact between them reminded me of the difficult and dangerous understanding between different communities when distrust prevails. We can imagine something similar in moments of our past, like the first contact between European navigators and indigenous peoples of the Americas, for example. Distrust, fear, displays of power to intimidation... the film shows these in a very interesting way, with the apes being very similar to us, in behavior and way of think. Unfortunately, the whole film is quite pretentious and full of self-importance: both sides have an exaggerated awareness of the relevance of events to their own community. This is the most boring point of the movie. The actors do a good job, but non-human characters get more interest and dominate the scene. Technically, the film doesn't deserve major criticism. CGI is more cautious than in the first movie and seems more real. Sequences of combat and action are breathtaking, certainly pleasing to those who seek action and adventure.",

It's a gorgeous-looking movie and nearly everything about it works.It takes a while for the story to really get going, just as it was with Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the previous film. But once the action starts, the cinematography really starts to shine. The action sequences are some of the best I've seen in a long time. The vibrant colors bring out incredible detail and the camera follows everything perfectly. Once again, Andy Serkis is magnificent as Caesar. Really, all of the motion capture imagery is just beyond stunning. There's so much behind the facial expressions and mannerisms of the apes: brotherhood, pain, etc. It's incredible how much emotion is evoked in the actors' performances when they hardly even speak!The script does a wonderful job at developing the apes as characters, but Dawn suffers from the same problem that Rise had: clichéd and underdeveloped human characters. Gary Oldman makes the most of his smaller supporting role, but the rest of the human characters behave in ways that are quite illogical that make it difficult to really care about them or understand them. Some of the human characters don't even do enough to justify their large presence in the film.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes mostly overcomes what flaws it has with an intelligent story, engaging political drama, and beautiful, smooth direction. It improves upon its predecessor in every way and enriches the drama of an enduring saga.Story: 8Acting: 8.5Script: 7.5Visuals/Sound: 10Entertainment Value: 8.5OVERALL SCORE: 8.5/10",

You get so used to the apes, that you forget that they are created with special effects. That is the mark of truly fantastic work and you can't help but be impressed. In films like this, it is easy for the human actors to fall to the wayside, but that does not happen here .. at least not with the leads. Jason Clarke's Malcolm believably connects with Caesar and forms a bond that I feared would not be achievable. It's a shame that Serkis won't get award consideration due to being a motion capture actor. He deserves it. The battles were intense and the film does a great job causing you to wonder if your favorite characters will live or die. Lastly, the film is very poignant and provides excellent social commentary without cramming it down your throat. A worthy successor, which is hard to come by these days.\r The Bad: I gotta admit it ... scenes of monkeys, riding horses, wielding machine guns, and leaping through fire were among the more ridiculous scenes that I have ever seen. They were during some very serious moments, and I couldn't help but laugh at them. Some of the supporting cast was pretty cliche and forgettable.

Thankfully, everyone involved was fully aware of that and delivered another smart blockbuster with a lot of vital commentary on the futility of war and violent conflicts. The film doesn't want you to pick a side too easily as hostility between the last remaining humans on Earth and the intelligent apes arise. There are decent and bad characters on both sides. This makes for an interesting ride, as the conflict spins more and more into chaos and there is little anyone can do against it, after a point of no return. Once again, the CGI is incredible, thanks to great motion capture acting and the accompanying special effects. Thankfully, the human actors are en par, especially Gary Oldman only takes two short scenes to make a strong point for being one of the best of his generation. The gloomy atmosphere, the great cinematography, it all adds up to an intelligent and pretty damn entertaining continuation of the story.

It’s a little too long and generates more cloying sentimentality than genuine emotion. Still it has enough action in a sturdy enough plot to keep the audience quiet.

Much of the novel factor of Planet of the Ape franchise is how believably humane the apes can be, it's also a measure bar as comparing the movies of this franchise in order serves as prove of technology advancement. Andy Serkis has perfected a masterful interpretation of the ape-human mime hybrid. It's not an overstatement that the apes fare better and more convincing than the human counterpart.\r Visual is splendid and aesthetically pleasing. It's not as extravagant as other blockbusters in recent time, but the art direction offers a unique appeal. Different than most grayish dire post-apocalypse setting, the movie turns to a more organic setting, a lustful return-to-nature background while some of civilization remains still stand tattered. Glossy urban areas have now coated with rustic flavor while the apes territory is leaning towards early civilization settlement. One is deteriorating while the other contrastingly and gradually improves.\r The movie has one of the best uses of motion capture lately. Apes moves with fluid almost humanized motion even though some of the hunchback traits still persist. It's interesting to see such varied range of emotion that can be conveyed by the apes' while most of them only communicate with body language. Action sequences are well done; a couple of scenes are shot in very interesting point of view or continuous shot. It's a little heavier on action than the prequel.\r However, the humans aren't nearly as intriguing. Jason Clarke as Malcolm, the engineer and leader figure does a decent job, but he's eclipsed by Andy Serkis' Caesar. He's not really an engaging lead role as James Franco was, and it's a bit underwhelming when the movie tries to compare the two together. Gary Oldman as Dreyfus works with what he has. Being a man with practically a thousand faces, he can pull off any role, but here his character is rather unexceptional.\r The plot is a bit overused though; those who have seen Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas or Avatar will find little surprise. Granted, there's only so much this \"two civilizations\" premise could go and the movie does go for more mature outlook, but a lot of the scenes foreshadow any twist the movie could've had, even more so for those knowledgeable of the franchise. In the end Dawn of the Planet of the Apes does any movie strive to, it immerses the audience and makes them invest in the character's struggle. With the pace it's going the apes are here to stay.",

That was until the Fox executives got their hands into the project and turned it into a virtual home movie and pilot for a failed TV series. It took 40 years but we finally have that great battle movie in our hands. The actors playing apes do an excellent job and you never once wonder if they are real or not you are just immersed in the film. The action and plot have many twists and turns and keeps you interested for the full duration of the film. I really love what these new movies do for the franchise giving it the credibility that the continuing 70's sequels could never give.",

What an amazing film! The visuals were FANTASTIC, the characters were well realized, especially the apes, and the story is for the most part unpredictable and takes some not so heavy twists and turns that still present a strong effect on the movie itself. There are really no plain and simple, black and white characters. As for the main characters (Caesar, Koba, Malcom and his family, even Dreyfus) present such three dimensional characters. Even for the supporting characters, they don't fully present three dimensional characters, but more of representations of different themes of characters that were used to see in movies. For example, you have a character that despises Apes for everything that's happened to the world when really he's afraid of this new world. Essentially, all the characters serve a purposeful role, three dimensional or not. In the end, it's a beautifully dark and exciting installment filled with beautiful cinematography, set pieces and fascinating characters (mainly Caesar and Koba). Overall, it's one of the greatest sequels of all time! I give this masterpiece an A+!",

Some movies, like 22 Jump Street and X-Men stood out to be great films, but some have been poor. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is not only a great film, but a masterpiece that far exceeds all of its predecessors, from the original film to the good prequel Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is flawless in every way possible, from the plot to the CGI. The acting was generally solid, but nothing too special. However, Serkis is unbelievably good as Caesar once again and Toby Kebbell is even better as Koba. The plot created by Matt Reeves and co. is action packed, smart, emotional, and, in general, beautiful (for the lack of a better word). However, the apes were the stars of the show. Caesar, Maurice, Blue Eyes, and especially Koba were all great and each took on significant roles in the film. Lastly, the CGI. The effects in this film are the best I've possibly ever seen in a film. It was so realistic you would think the ape actors were in costumes. In general, this film is a must see this summer and easily turned an OK movie summer to a great one. This movie will make your summer.",

Of course the \"end of the world fanboy\" in me was getting all hyped up for this movie and it didn't disappoint. Everything in the movie was pretty good, expect for the CGI at parts, but luckily CGI doesn't make a movie bad or good. Thoug at some parts the CGI was one of the best I've ever seen. The story is what got me hooked though. It really tells the tale of the struggles of a virus that almost wipes out the human race. The movie starts of slow, but it's mainly building up tension that builds joe between three groups. One ceaser is (spoiler) shot by Koba, all help breaks loose. The story is not totally comeplex and is quite a rehash, but they execute it perfectly. The acting is also fantastic by the lead human and it really shows the terrifying natur of the apes.

To be honest after the initial wow factor you completely forget that the apes aren't really actors. They look fantastic in the different weather scenarios. Only when you see an animated bear and an animated monkey do you feel like you are watching some moving pixels. The story itself is extremely gripping, an emotional roller-coaster which could be deemed a little predictable but at the same time has enough about it in terms of imagery and great directing to get away with any obvious twists or turns. A wonderful movie which might be hard to top in the next instalment.",

On top of that you get a great story and solid acting from both the monkeys (Andy Serkis is always fantastic) and the humans. Its also very moving at times and has a lot of emotional depth. An altogether smashing sequel that is to Rise of the Planet of the Apes what The Dark Knight was to Batman Begins.",

This was one of the most awesome,thoughtful and enjoyable movie of the year. Many critics have bashed it for being a bit clichéd or because of other reasons but I have to say that I loved the movie. I watched it in 3D because the town there I live in was no option other than 3d so I watched it in 3d.I thought was going to be dead for me already because for what I know from my experiences 3D is just a way to gain more money at the box office by offering the viewers a device to watch the film thats gonna ruin the experience. Luckily it didnt happen with this one. I am glad it didnt and I am actually happy,kind of,that it screened in 3d because the 3d enhanced the feeling for this movie.The 3d format was vivid and it actually add to the involvement of the story. Talking about the story. The story was really really good and I am surprised to say this because I didnt expect this movie to impress,surprise and entertain me so much. The key elements like the action,the pacing and story were done really well. What I found most interesting was the character development. Every character was treated so well I thought I was dreaming because you dont expect this from a summer movie. This summer movie though,for me, I felt it was done with passion and dedication. It is a great movie and it is one of the year's best ones.",

Then, it turns out the flu thing was not the main of the movie. The CGI monkeys were amazing. I wish the future Jurassic World #upcoming will learn from this movie. The drama plot is really move my heart. It's a breath-taking. Until the end, me and my bf still wonders who's the name of Caesar first son. Which means, the plot was made enchant us. It's an epic story and so many moral views I discovered. There were kids just went out  from previous showtime before me, and they just had this remarkable 'deep conversation' of this movie. These kids learned well. Or, the movie gave them a flawless show. Two story-sides in the whole one time show, and the ending was showing the 'pretty much' misunderstanding reason of world war could began. How original... but, still it's a fact from reality situation of our world war, now. It really has the same great quality with the first movie. I mean, come on, people, this second movie even gives us the details and new stuffs. New and best stuffs. While in the middle of the screen, I got this feeling, \"It feels like I watch LOTR:The Two Towers. I found amazing CGI and amazing new storyline.\" THAT's WHAT WE NEED FROM SEQUEL QUALITY!!!!\r As I said before, if you guys think this movie lack of something, it must be the thrilling of human being chased by the monkeys, right? My favorite part was the building hide and seek, but as I said before, too short scene. If there still flu victims who still struggle to be alive, I bet this movie could get 10 points from me. But, those my wild-mind plot got paid by Gary Oldman heart-breaking crying scene. :'\"((((\r GIVE GARY OLDMAN AN OSCAR!!!!",

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is not only a fantastic movie filled with great action and emotion. It's also responsible for giving us a powerful sci-fi character to go side by side with the greatest in history like Darth Vader and Spock. That character is Caesar, who was already great in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, however in this movie we see his new phase in the evolution. We get to see what is in my opinion the most compelling character in a sci-fi int he past decade develop himself as a leader.\r On top of that, we also get Koba, another fantastic ape that you're bound to keep in your mind for years to come.\r Finally, I was super happy and surprise with how solid the human side of the story is. The movie never forgets that is about the apes, but it still manages to give us an interesting and well developed human story on the side.\r Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is FANTASTIC.",

So I looked up theSaw it last night...\r I loved 'Rise' but despite its great reviews, I left 'Dawn' feeling a little hollow.\r While this movie is set in the same world as 'Rise', I personally did not see much of that movie in this one. So I looked up the credits, and to my surprise, noticed the writing and production are being handled by the same people in both movies... with the exception of Mark Bomback, who has been added as both writer and producer.\r The most prestigious names in Mark Bomback's writing resume are Live Free Or Die Hard (2007), and the Total Recall (2012) reboot. As for his producing resume, I'll spare you (it's worse).\r 6 different production companies were involved with 'Rise'. Only one – Chernin Entertainment – is listed for 'Dawn'. While one would expect the latter to tell a more focused and enjoyable film, it's actually 'Rise' that felt more fleshed-out and cohesive. That first movie was an unexpected hit. It pleasantly surprised everyone by being a cut above the generic fare that Hollywood has been giving us since the 90's ended. The writing, the directing, the photography... it felt like a lot of very talented people got together and really, really tried for that one. I did not get the same sense here.\r Could the addition of writer and Executive Producer Mark Bomback have negatively impacted the end product that much? I'm not sure. I wasn't there. And it's not like 'Dawn' is a *bad* movie. There's a lot about it I enjoyed (beginning with Caesar's facial expressions) but as with movies like Maleficent, Oblivion, Noah, Immortals, 300 Rise of an Empire, etc. there's nothing technically wrong with this movie. I enjoyed them all on different levels. But there's nothing there I'm likely to purchase a physical copy of anytime soon.\r It seems Hollywood never intended to launch a new Apes trilogy. They had a wonderful idea to create a prequel, and it worked. We could have very easily transitioned from 'Rise' to either of Heston's or Wahlberg's Planet Of The Apes movies. But it became a commercial hit, so we have to squeeze 2 new chapters in there before the Apes truly take over.\r That's how this felt. Milk this cow dry for another 2 chapters, and then what? We'll have caught up to the timeline where the Apes rule the world. Will they leave well enough alone? Of course not. They'll probably film an entirely new trilogy set in that world, effectively rebooting the entire thing.\r Though I wouldn't call 'Dawn' a bad movie, I fear we are currently witnessing the Transformers-ification of the Planet Of The Apes franchise. So enjoy this one while you can, because something tells me these will become increasingly soulless with every chapter.\r Just like a certain other franchise.",
