They instead ended up arresting Turing himself on charges of ‘gross indecency’, an accusation that would lead to his devastating conviction for the criminal offense of homosexuality – little did officials know, they were actually incriminating the pioneer of modern-day computing. Famously leading a motley group of scholars, linguists, chess champions and intelligence officers, he was credited with cracking the so-called unbreakable codes of Germany's World War II Enigma machine.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "This suspenseful drama reveals pieces of its puzzle steadily and slowly, until the final heartrending picture can be seen at last. Remarkably, it comes from a screenwriter who had never had a feature film produced and a director who had never made one in English.",
    "The film works as well as it does due to the genius of Benedict Cumberbatch and the way he has inhabited Alan Turing’s persona.",
    "Another must-see movie this year-end awards season (the other one is The Theory of Everything) is the brilliant encapsulation of one of the greatest stories of our time — the genius, heroism and ultimately shameful destruction of Alan Turing.",
    "On its bright face, The Imitation Game, written by Graham Moore and directed by Morten Tyldum, fits into that cozy genre of tortured-genius biopics that sprout like kudzu just in time for the Oscars. But that’s not fair to the film, which outthinks and outplays other examples of the genre.",
    "Cumberbatch radiates such intelligence — with Sherlock and this, egghead Benedict is his speciality — that gaps are easily excused. From sets and costumes to Alexandre Desplat's musical score, The Imitation Game is everything classy that Hollywood wishes it could be.",
    "The disturbing, involving, always-complex story of British mathematician Alan Turing is a tale crafted to resonate for our time, and the smartly entertaining The Imitation Game gives it the kind of crackerjack cinematic presentation that's pure pleasure to experience.",
    "Many of the people reading this review are doing it on a computer. And all of them are reading it in English. It’s not much of stretch to say that you could credit both of those things to a man named Alan Turing.",
    "In the end, however, the genius behind all the innovations of Bletchley was destroyed by the pettiness of a society that didn't understand him. The Imitation Game doesn't hide this dark aspect and it makes the production sobering and engrossing.",
    "The film that director Morten Tyldum has made from Hodges’s book is a shinier, less trustworthy thing, but it’s ripping old-school Oscar bait, and if it sends moviegoers off to check the facts, all the better.",
    "It does a poor job of showing the tragedy of Turing’s hidden life but a better job at making a bigger case — unconventional people make unconventional thinkers.",
    "The Imitation Game is most on its game when it primarily sticks to being a John le Carre-lite espionage  version of “Revenge of the Nerds.”",
    "It's been a long time since intellectual sparring created such excitement onscreen. I've heard a few critics dismiss this mind-bender as hopelessly old-hat. Ha! If so, long live retro. ​",
    "Cumberbatch's scenes with Knightley are a model of how a buttoned-up character can open and reveal himself.",
    "The film is anchored by yet another hypnotically complex Cumberbatch performance. He's turning greatness into a habit.",
    "A finely etched character study, with Cumberbatch on towering form. Set coordinates for the Oscars.",
    "While Graham Moore's screenplay isn't without its flaws, it brilliantly weaves into the story a case that being different shouldn't necessarily be a negative thing. In fact, The Imitation Game argues in no uncertain terms that those differences can be something to celebrate, not to \"cure.\"",
    "When it's good, The Imitation Game is very good. Cumberbatch is terrific, which is not surprising, given the marriage of role and actor.",
    "Even with all its elisions and distortions it tells a cracking good story. Turing is played with captivating strangeness by Benedict Cumberbatch.",
    "A superb thriller and a worthy biopic of a real hero. It’s also simultaneously an encouraging follow-up for Headhunters’ Morten Tyldum, an impressive debut for screenwriter Graham Moore, and a big-screen career highlight for Benedict Cumberbatch.",
    "Its various riffs on codes, whether moral, sexual, societal or German, are plain to see rather than enigmatic or enlightening. Luckily it’s all anchored in a storming performance from Cumberbatch: you’ll be deciphering his work long after the credits roll.",
    "So innately compelling is Turing’s story — to say nothing of Benedict Cumberbatch’s masterful performance — it’s hard not to get caught up in this well-told tale and its skillful manipulations.",
    "Strong, stirring, triumphant and tragic, The Imitation Game may be about a man who changed the world, but it’s also about the world that destroyed a man.",
    "It's a good story, a sad story, a story of triumph and prejudice and terrible hypocrisy. And Cumberbatch aces it all - another smartly realized but deeply soulful performance from an actor who seemingly can do no wrong.",
    "The Imitation Game is vibrant and lively, engaging you on three levels: The fascinating way the Nazis managed to outwit the rest of the world until Turing came along, how his giant contraption (essentially the world’s first computer) will work, and what will happen to him and everyone he knows when the truth about him is finally revealed.",
    "The Imitation Game is the one film that might have been better off longer. Starting the story in 1938 and just going through Turing’s life chronologically might have taken an extra 20 or 30 minutes, but it would have been worth it.",
    "As MI6 head Stewart Menzies, Strong is my favorite of the supporting players — witty, knowing, deserving of his own movie and yet comfortably a part of this one.",
    "Viewers may get the sense that The Imitation Game leaves Turing’s essential mysteries intact, but they will nonetheless find even the most public contours of his story ripe with drama, excitement and deeply affecting resonance.",
    "\"Imitation\" illuminates Turing's brilliance in an engrossing and moving film that features a standout, Oscar-worthy performance by Benedict Cumberbatch.",
    "The Imitation Game is entertaining and well-crafted, but one still can’t help but wish the drama had a bit more bite and nerve throughout.",
    "The Imitation Game is a highly conventional movie about a profoundly unusual man. This is not entirely a bad thing.",
    "The constant in The Imitation Game is Benedict Cumberbatch’s terrific performance as Turing, which has much in common with his delightfully mercurial Sherlock Holmes, but with an underpinning of repressed emotion and quiet despair.",
    "Turing will survive this film with his enigma intact, but the movie itself is the opposite of enigmatic, and Cumberbatch merits more.",
    "Dominating it all is Cumberbatch, whose charisma, tellingly modulated and naturalistic array of eccentricities, Sherlockian talent at indicating a mind never at rest and knack for simultaneously portraying physical oddness and attractiveness combine to create an entirely credible portrait of genius at work.",
    "What lingers is the feeling that the filmmakers may pay lip service to Turing’s sexuality, but they prefer to keep his sex life strictly theoretical. Careful, there: No tracking dirt on the nice clean prestige picture.",
    "The Imitation Game is at its best when it focuses on the collision between cryptography and proto-programming. (No individual can truly be said to have invented the computer, but Turing comes close.)",
    "It's a reserved, almost conservative performance, and in holding so much back so much of the time, Cumberbatch makes his few outward displays of emotion far more impactful.",
    "Although sturdy enough in the middlebrow entertainment department, and handsomely mounted in a stiff upper-lip, prestige period-piece sort of way, The Imitation Game is ultimately a frightfully ordinary sort of seasonal ritual.",
    "Turing’s tale needs to be more widely known, and while The Imitation Game may not be a great film, it is an important one.",
    "The Imitation Game's approach is successful as entertainment but not totally satisfactory in providing greater insight into its subject.",
    "It’s a marvelous story about science and humanity, plus a great performance by Benedict Cumberbatch, plus first-rate filmmaking and cinematography, minus a script that muddles its source material to the point of betraying it. Those strengths make the movie worth seeing, but the writing keeps eating away at the narrative’s clarity — and integrity — until it’s impossible to separate the glib fictions from the remarkable facts.",
    "The romance of patriotism and pain, depicted here in lush greens and velvety blues, makes “The Imitation Game” enjoyable enough to render it a vindication of the formula. It disappoints as biography, but makes for a great yarn, even if you've heard it before.",
    "Ultimately, though, director Morten Tyldum’s conventional approach doesn’t do full justice to his tragically unconventional hero.",
    "What Cumberbatch delivers is an impressively rounded character study of someone variously kind, prickly, aggressive, awkward and supremely confident. But it's almost too nuanced. Accuracy isn't all, but fumbling in the dark isn't always fun.",
    "The Imitation Game is a film about a human calculator which feels... a little too calculated.",
    "Where Imitation Game ultimately falters is in tackling Turing's later years and subsequent demise. In some ways, this period is meant to bookend the film, but instead just leaves unanswered questions while diminishing actual historical events.",
    "Throughout The Imitation Game, there’s a sense the filmmaker is trying to shield viewers from the story’s most difficult parts — whether it’s the horrors of war, the technical complexity of the Enigma code and its solution, or the bleakness of Alan Turing’s final fate. I wish Tyldum had trusted the audience enough to let us in on the worst. It would have made his movie so much better.",
    "Tyldum has robbed his own film of emotional depth — this Turing is as simple as Morse code. Rather than a complex human portrait, this is an assemblage of triumphs, tragedies and tics.",
    "Given the liberties the film takes, it's surprising that it refuses to penetrate Alan Turing's carnality and allow Benedict Cumberbatch to truly wrestle with the torment of the man's sexuality.",
    "This could have been a story of immense heroism, tragic sacrifice and agonizing historical irony, and it hints in that direction, in its stiff-upper-lip fashion, before retreating into a vain search for a happy ending and an effort to turn itself into “The King’s Speech.”"

However, in the hands of director Morten Tyldum it has, surprisingly, become so much more. Starting with a smart and dense screenplay, which hones in on three different periods of time in the life of code breaker Alan Turing, the story is utterly compelling. Wisely, it has also been told in a straightforward and un complicated manner and after about 10 minutes one gets a dizzying sense that the film is going to be an absolute gem, a feeling that reaches fulfilment 2 hours later as the credits roll.\rThe recreation of time and place has been lovingly captured via excellent production design. In fact, the film is rich in detail. There are breathtaking vistas of war torn Britain which includes shots of bombers wreaking devastation over London and submarines firing rockets, as well as more ordinary depictions of rubble strewn streets and houses. It is also good to see the appropriate use of historic Bletchley Park as a backdrop to where all these events actually unfolded over 70 years ago. The editing seamlessly takes us from year to year without confusion or jarring transitions and the scenes leading up to, and immediately following, the breaking of the code are just thrilling. The music is another plus and whilst not particularly melodic it underscores what is happening on screen brilliantly.\rCriticism has been levelled at the film for not focusing more on Turing’s sexuality which is as untrue as it is unfair. Beyond seeing him actually bonking we have more than enough information as to the effect his sexuality had on his life and, ultimately his death. Scenes of his childhood also give insight into the man he would become. End titles, unlike the recent ‘Foxcatcher’ are also helpful and informative.\rUltimately, the film belongs to its powerful cast. Benedict Cumberbatch is a revelation and he brings real humanity to the tortured Turing. Some of his moments, particularly near the end, are almost unbearably moving.  Keira Knightley is almost his equal in a smaller but crucial role. She has real power here as Turing’s one time fiancé, the lone woman breaker who as it turns out is better than the men. Supporting actors Charles Dance, Rory Kinnear and Mark Strong all contribute characters that are more than mere ciphers. Also, it is to the credit of the boy playing Turing as a young man that we believe in the subsequent actions and performance of Cumberbatch.\rRarely is a film as all encompassing and engrossing as this one. It is a triumph on every level and a cinematic treat.",

Impeccable and moving performances from Cumberbatch and Knightley bring this tragic and compelling story to life. The storyline was always going to be fascinating, and this is paced very well, with a thorough and considered script enabling what could be a somewhat 'been there' war drama a more poignant note.

You even get to see flashbacks from Turing childhood and find out how he becomes the man or should I say hero of his time and even the today's modern era.\r Now about the characters in this film, Benedict Cumberbatch does an amazing job as Alan Turing, and what about Turing himself well all I'll say is that he is such a smart, to the point, and sees the world in a completely different way, that's what makes him so interesting, however the other characters in this film aren't really that interesting.\r So if your a fan of history or a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch or just enjoy great films, than The Imitation Game is just for you.",

Benedict Cumberbatch turns in a great performance as Turing, an egotistical anti-social professor and closet homosexual, which in Britain at that time could result in prison.\rWhile historical purists chafe at the nit picking details, it's still a very compelling, intelligent movie that grips you from the start and brings the accomplishments of Turing's work into fresh focus.    He tragically died of what is considered suicide by cyanide, although some think it could have been an accident during one of his experiments when he inhaled cyanide fumes while working on a project.\rHe was found guilty of homosexual behavior and ordered to undergo inhumane drug therapy that was designed to basically destroy his sex drive and chemically castrate him.\rIn death though Turing was finally accorded the hero's acclaim he deserved, and today is considered one of the first great pioneers of the modern computer.\r\"The Imitation Game\" is a brilliant film, and a great relief from the load of hit movies out there right now.",

HeIf there is a role of eccentric genius in near future, it will either land on Benedict Cumberbatch or be inevitably compared to his on The Imitation Game. As homage for a prestigious man, he displays acting caliber of the highest level. He dons the personality and quirks, brings out the best and also most fragile quality of a character. In no overstatement, he introduces a man on-screen and makes audience sympathizes with him as he should be appreciated in life.\r His role as Alan Turing is as splendid as one could hope be represented with. This probably rivals Russell Crows's performance in A Beautiful Mind. That being said, the rest of cast performs beautifully as well. Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke is wonderful. She's not flashy or extravagance in this role, instead she is deceptively bland, but has a more approachable and kind nature. Her demeanor is calming, also effective in bringing a pinch of innocence on time of war. The charming accent doesn't hurt either.\r Script are well done, dialogues fit the characters in less complicated way. It helps significantly since the theme is already a complex one, yet the underlying message is resoundingly clear, it need not to be deciphered. Character interaction feels authentic, from the honest troubling confession to the more awkward banter, even though some of these must have been slight exaggerated for cinema. Still, it's a nice way to convey their feelings.\r Pacing is meticulously done, often the movie strolls between different timelines, and manages to highlight each portion with timely fashion. The transition doesn't feel forced, it moves just the way it should naturally. It cleverly depicts Alan Turing's life, the better part and also lonely part of his time.\r The Imitation Game has a heavy undertaking of presenting a man's personal story, and with excellent acting and amazing script, it has done so marvelously.",

The big thing is how these three tales are mixed up to reveal the real essence of the protagonist, his objectives, joys, fears and concerns. The complexity of this character is beyond imagination, there are no words to describe Benedict Cumberbatch's performance, probably nobody could have done better; he definitely carries the movie on his shoulders. And by his side is Keira Knightley, whom maybe gave us her best acting in years. The problems start because the emphasis on the characters is so huge, that other things are left behind and not well appreciated, like the clever screenplay, the beautiful score and the coherent cinematography. However, as the story goes by, you discover the strong message behind it exposing one more time the awful nature of human being.

Throughout Cumberbatch shows true passion for playing this character causing much emotion when necessary but some comedic elements as well. From time to time you feel for Turing as he makes his attempts to crack Enigma. Not only does Cumberbatch provide emotion but the other cast members are at the same level. Joan Clarke (Kiera Knightley) the female member of the group is as allows you to see such a strong bond developing between the two of them making them a great pair when they are on-screen together. The bond also extends to the other mathematicians like Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode) and John Cairncross (Allen Leech) which incites a sort of family between them expressing not only the darker moments but some of the comedic elements from time to time.\r The story itself was incredible and kept me interested and engaged throughout. The film does put the emphasis on the Enigma code causing an awareness of how important the code really is. This emphasis does impact the story greatly in a positive way. During the film there are some extremely emotive scenes that envelope the audience die to the horrors of war and the importance of Enigma. The pacing was well done allowing time for not only the codebreaking itself but allow development of the characters and to see the changes of their understanding to not only Turing but to the code Enigma itself. There is a small part I did trip up on and did not understand however upon re-watching the film and investigating further it had become clearer. The most shocking part I found was the ending which makes me feel sad but more knowledgeable at the same time knowing what had happened within World War II and the factor that Turing played in.\r In all the Imitation game was an excellent film depicting the behind the scenes of the spy network. It was great to see such emphasis being placed on the codebreaking rather than action which most spy films are affiliated with. The story of the code breaking is enhanced even further through all the actors. They all put on stellar performances exerting emotion throughout which furthers the importance of gaining the knowledge of the Germans.

The story is basically divided into three parts - life during young age, carrying out mission and after the end of war, in which the life of Alan Turing, who holds a strong belief of atheism, is beautifully crafted thanks to the great scores from Alexandre Desplat even though there are moments of jumping around from year-to-year in narrating. The powerful performance from Benedict Cumberbatch alone in portraying the awkwardness, triumphant, arrogant, strangeness, both physical and mental struggling of this notorious protagonist and at the same time well supported by great delivery from the supporting cast have elevated this epic material entirely. It is not just about history of winning the war, but this game is actually an imitation of life full with thoughtful dialogues and pioneering work that tells the foundation of computerisation which overall place this biopic a great position to deserve an Oscar nomination.",

Known for his expertise as a mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, and philosopher, he was a pioneering computer scientist who created the template for what would become the computers we use today. However, his accomplishments were never publicly known due to his criminal prosecution for being a homosexual.\rBenedict Cumberbatch stars as Turing, and along with his team of code-breakers, were responsible for cracking Nazi Germany's Enigma code. This is particularly important as this was the Nazi's primary code for communicating with its forces around the world. Many of the worlds brightest minds had tried and failed to find the solution to the complex code, but it was this group of minds at Britains top-secret overnment Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park (Charles Dance), a head strong military man with his suspicions about Turing, and MI6's Stewart Menzies (Mark Strong), who has a keen interest in the results of the groups work.\rAfter several unsuccessful tries at breaking the code, Turing began his work to develop a machine that could find a way to break the code on its own. Turing took his thoughts directly to Prime Minister Winston Churchill and was given ultimate power over the project. Assembling a team which consisted of scholars, mathematicians, linguists, a chess champion, the team continued to search for an answer to the riddle while Turing began his work on the machine. Turing, being a socially awkward person, found it difficult to work in a group setting and alienated himself from his coworkers. The caring voice of Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), a brilliant mathematician who would aid Turing into winning the trust of his team, would become his most trusted confidant. The clock was ticking on the group to crack the code as the war began to reach a breaking point for the allies. The pressure to achieve his life's goal was beginning to take hold.\rWe experience the troubled childhood of the young genius as his deals with the loss of his most cherished love, we endure the journey of the genius responsible for the end of the war, and we suffer through the the tragedy of his post-war decline following his conviction for gross indecency, but we are rewarded with the story of a brave, tortured soul who became a national treasure. The performance of Benedict Cumberbatch is one to cherish. The portrayal of such a frail human spirit who defied the odds and shaped the history of the world is inspiring and Oscar worthy. Keira Knightley is strong, charming and a perfect compliment to Cumberbatch. Each scene between the two was magical. Matthew Goode is tremendous as Turing's reluctant ally. Goode engaged his characters spirit head on and challenged Cumberbatch's Turing as a chess champion would. Each member of the remaining cast, including the wonderful Mark Strong, was sensational with each providing a wonderful compliment to the telling of the story.\rOverall, The Imitation Game is an absolute treasure and should no doubt hear its name called at nomination time this year. A captivating story of loss and tragedy, but also one of triumphant victory which will no doubt engulf you in your thoughts of how sexual persecution has crippled our society for too long. Alan Turing deserved better, thankfully he has finally gotten his due.",

The technical and scientific aspect will be satisfying to nerds and not so detailed to go over the heads of the rest of the audience. The acting is natural, believable and gets you involved with the lives of all the individual. Though it covers many serious subjects there are quite a few laugh out loud lines and scenes spring from the natural aspects of the characters.\r For those who never heard of Alan Turing he was an English mathematical genius who broke the German Enigma code and is said to be responsible for WW2 ending 2-4 years earlier than it would have. He also was arrested for being a homosexual in 1951 and was given the choice of prison or chemical castration. He was to eventually commit suicide though his mother contends that it was an accident.\r Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing shows the man’s brilliance while at the same time shows that he wasn’t comfortable around people and offering all around him humor by his lack of social understanding. Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke the only female member of the group who worked on the Enigma code and accepts Turing proposal of marriage. Each member of the group are comfortable in their roles with Matthew Goode, described as a ‘cad’, a standout. Charles Dance, Mark Strong, Allen Leech, Rory Kinnear, Mattew Beard and Alex Lawther as the young Turing, all add to the strength of the film.\r The screenplay by Graham Moore is sharp, the direction by Morten Tyldum moves things smoothly along and handles the alternating between the three different time periods without any confusion.\r Right now Cumberbatch is the front runner for the Best Actor Oscar, deservingly so, and the movie is on many 10 best lists. Though I feel what makes it from being a perfect movie is how he was brought down in his life, his homosexuality, is sort of slighted from how/why he was caught and the society that made it a crime at that time.\r “The Imitation Game, is a must see movie for anyone who likes an intelligent, emotionally moving finely acted film.",

The Imitation Game is one of the best movies of the year, and my favorite biography movies of all time. Watch this movie,  its worth it, trust me. 10/10.",

This personal story allowed me to get invested in the film in a way that I couldn’t’ have otherwise. Alan Tuning’s story is one that I was able to relate to with Bennedict Cumberbatch doing a wonderful job portraying the character. Along with this gripping story the film also has the intense conflict of the codebreaking, is well acted, and well shot. I would highly recommend this film to everyone especially anyone who felt like the black sheep growing up. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself on the screen and bring some tissues if you are emotional its not a happy story and if you are sensitive you will probably shed a tear. Happy this film is getting Oscar buzz and wish it the best of luck at the Oscars as it deserves all the recognition it can get. As for Cumberbatch I hope this if the first of many excellent films eh will star in.",

He may even have saved the life of my own beloved grandfather who worked in the Brooklyn (New York) Navel Yard all throughout World War 2! A military target that would have eventually been within reach of German submarines.\r If it wasn’t for Alan Turing’s genius, integrity and perseverance all of history would have been changed for the worse. Another minor footnote: He’s also the father of the modern computer and one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived.\r Despite being one of the giants of the 20th century, few people outside those with a passion for history or computing have ever heard of the man until now. No universities or streets are named after him. No statues or portrait honor him anywhere in the world all because he is gay. In fact, it took the Queen of England to the year 2013 to issue him a pardon for having consensual sex - in the privacy of his home - with another man! In 2013! That’s an abomination. The Queen of England is sitting on her throne in one piece because of this man! She should have laid a wreath on his grave decades ago!\r I’m not ashamed to admit it, but I sobbed at the end of this movie! This is a most profound story about love!  YES! LOVE! Intense, passionate love is not limited to just heterosexuals!\r It’s also a story about sex. I was born in the 1960’s and consensual sex - in the privacy of one’s home - between men was legal in the State I was living in when I turned 18. But the stigma of being a sexual minority remains in way too many places – and affects me greatly in my own personal life to this very day. The pain I – and others – have suffered for being “different” is indescribable. This story validates my experiences and the experiences of millions of other sexual minorities – from around the world - both living and deceased.\r The cruelty Alan Turing experienced from his classmate is similar to what I had to endure in high school. But I was lucky; I never had to worry about having consensual sex with another man in the privacy of my own home. But in Alan Turing’s case you get to see a good man who gave so incredibly much to the world be ripped apart by pure evil that was 100% legal back in the 1950’s! It’s so ironic too! Watch closely. The police officer breaks the law and he is the one who should be legitimately imprisoned! It’s not just in the United States that police officers feel they are above the law they supposedly serve!\r Memo to Hollywood: This shows you know how to make great movies. Sure, you won’t make billions every time, but you’re gonna make a tidy profit by doing a spectacular job. Wouldn’t you rather make a film people will be watching 500 years from now on another planet in another solar system then making trash, like The Hobbit trilogy, that no will care about once it leaves the theaters?\r One more point to ponder: Michelangelo is considered by most people to be the greatest sculptor who ever lived. He was a gay man and he lived centuries ago - in peace - till he reached 88 (Yes 8-8). Now fast-forward to the 1950’s - in what was supposedly the country that birthed modern democracy - and look what the British did to one of the greatest mathematicians that ever lived only because he is gay!",

The core of the movie is the cracking of Enigma with some flash back to Turing youth and flash forward to Turing last year (actually, the movie starts in the 50s and then jumps back to the war years – a completely useless editing idea).\r Altogether not a bad story and certainly a great Cumberbatch and Knightley interpretation. The supporting actors are also good and there is some moment of British humor to lighten the atmosphere.  The only thing I find objectionable is that the movie gives the idea that Turing was the only one who actually cracked the code. The solitary genius who did it all on his own and even against his own team  - with the exception of the Knightley character.\r All this to put Turing on an even higher pedestal and to underline that he was such as genius AND gay. Basically gay = genius in this movie.  Which seems rather far-fetched, because it surely is a fact that not all gay people are geniuses, just like not all straight people are….. Then again, the “solitary” hero concept is a lot more fascinating than “team work”.",

There’s a deep message surrounding what the difference between a machine and a human is, and what their similarities are. The movie also does raise moral questions on what’s normal and what’s not, and what that means. I totally love this movie. It surpassed my expectations and it’s both ingenious as it is clever. As Alan Turing said in the movie: “Are you paying attention? Good. If you’re not listening carefully, you will miss things”. That quote is the one thing that kept me entertained, because you really need to pay attention if you want to perceive everything. The structure is very nonlinear, and you must pay attention!\r The first half of the movie is more of the main mission, to crack the code. The rest is much more versatile and exiting. The action-sequences are especially great. Benedict Cumberbatch is really good; it might be one of his greatest performances to date. His character; Alan Turning is extremely well presented, and I really felt close to him during the whole movie.

The injustice suffered by Alan Turig (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) is so horrific it’s hard to image that what happened to him occurred little more than 60 years ago.  Unfortunately, the movie just isn’t as interesting as it should be. It feels slow because the story is told in a very safe and old fashioned sort of way.  I felt like I was watching Tinker Tailor Solder Spy except there wasn’t any intrigue and I didn’t have to engage my brain to try and figure anything out.  Cumberbatch is very believable in the role of a gay, socially awkward and self-absorbed genius.  Charles Dance (in something of a reprise of his role as Tywin Lannister in Game of Thrones) plays a powerful military commander who simply doesn’t like Turig, much in the way that Tywin Lannister doesn’t like his son Tyrion.  Kiera Knightley is okay as Turig’s genius, old-maid colleague, but her character is rather boring.  The most interesting character is that of Mi6 spook Stewart Menzies, (played by Mark Strong, also from Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy), who knows who everyone is and what they are about, but is using them all for his own purposes and doesn’t really care what they do in their private lives.

It springs from his brilliance in solving the secret codes from Nazi Germany's Enigma machine, which helped the Allies win the war. In the 50s, he was arrested and his solitary life took an unfortunate turn. Cumberbatch turns in a nuanced and touching performance without ever being pitiful (Alex Lawther is also poignant as the young Turing). The intelligent and sometimes humorous screenplay provides a solid groundwork for this compelling story. What could have been a dry lesson in code-breaking turns into a touching look at a fascinating personality.",

This tells some people That Alan Turning must have had some kind of autism, yet was brilliant, if only people had been more tolerant (as some are in the movie). I thought the movie was well-written in trying to explain how they were trying to crack the enigma, but I didn't feel it necessary to take such dramatic license when it distorts facts, like the Russian spy situation which Alan was not involved in, and other such distortions (Alan's team did not make the life and death decisions once cracking the code, others did). But Alan's story was interesting, the story was told in an entertaining manner as well as educational (which makes the distortions jarring), good acting, then ultimately sad because Alan was misunderstood in his time. What a difference today on understanding people that are different, whether being deficient in social graces or preferring one's gender, and poor Alan had both. Had that been tolerated, what more could Alan have accomplished that would have helped us all.",

Additionally i believe the film could have been more focused on the enigma problem, as Turings backstory, while necessary to complete the documentation of his life, drags on slightly. The film is at its best regarding the solving of the Enigma problem, which thankfully  a proportionally large amount of the film is devoted too. In all a fine portrayal of one of my most favoured historical and scientific figures, despite these criticisms id recommend this film to anyone with even a passing mathematical or code-breaking interest.",

The screenplay is warm and effective, the score is so beautiful (probably the best of 2014), the story is so important and the message you can extract is so universal and important to mankind. BUT the best part is the epic performance by Benedict Cumberbatch, an emotional but restrained tour de force which reminds me of some of the greatest performances of the last decade (Heath Ledger comes to mind). It is in my opinion the best performance of 2014, over Eddie Redmayne and Michael Keaton. The film is a little bit by the numbers like any biopic is but in this case it all fits wonderfully and the dialogues are very clever, and by the end, the importance of the story being told grabs you and does not let you go. I was ready to give it a very strong 8 out of 10, but I am very surprised at the staying power it is having on me, typical of great films with a lot of depth and layers which become more impacting after letting them sink in your head,  so I have to give it an unexpected 9 out of 100.
