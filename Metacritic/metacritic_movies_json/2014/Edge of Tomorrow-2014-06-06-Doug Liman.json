Bill Cage (Tom Cruise) is an officer who has never seen a day of combat when he is unceremoniously dropped into what amounts to little more than a suicide mission. Killed within minutes, Cage now finds himself inexplicably thrown into a time loop\u2014forcing him to live out the same brutal combat over and over, fighting and dying again\u2026and again. But with each battle, Cage becomes able to engage the adversaries with increasing skill, alongside Special Forces warrior Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt).

    "critic_reviews": [
        "Edge of Tomorrow is the ultimate metaphor about Tom Cruise\u2019s career. You can\u2019t kill this guy. He\u2019ll just keep coming. And he remains arguably the biggest movie star in the world for a reason. He brings it.",
        "A mix of forward-looking sci-fi, classic themes, deft plotting and superb writing and direction, Edge of Tomorrow may be the pure-pleasure blockbuster to beat this Summer.",
        "The reason the film works is because it throws everything into the blender and comes up with something new, something that has a great lively sense of wit and humor to it, and it takes the time to fully explore its wild premise fully.",
        "It's a star-driven mass-market entertainment that's smart, exciting and unexpected while not stinting on genre satisfactions.",
        "Liman keeps the action and surprises coming nonstop. OK, the end is a head-scratcher. Until then, Cruise and Blunt make dying a hugely entertaining game of chance.",
        "The movie has an organic intelligence and a sense that it, too, exists outside of linear time. It seems to be creating itself as you watch it.",
        "For a film about repetition, Edge of Tomorrow never feels tired or familiar.",
        "An entertaining, effects-driven black comedy, with shades of \"Starship Troopers\" in its depiction of warfare as a futuristic turkey shoot, the movie is distinguished more by how fluidly it handles its high-concept premise than where it takes it.",
        "Despite its terribly unimaginative title, Edge of Tomorrow is a surprisingly imaginative summer action movie.",
        "Liman stages the chaotic action scenes, including several iterations of the beach assault, with clarity, precision, and wit. This is his best movie since 2002's \"The Bourne Identity.\"",
        "A furiously time-looping joy ride and the smartest action film of the early summer season.",
        "Edge of Tomorrow repeats itself without being repetitive, takes itself seriously while providing some laughs and offers plenty of action without short-changing us on the intelligence front.",
        "Crucially, Cruise knows just how to pace Cage\u2019s shift from cowardly to courageous. Yes, we get cool effects and impressive machinery. But he and Liman add unexpected humor and genuine tension to the seasonal thrill of blowing stuff up.",
        "The breakneck pace leaves little room for meaningful character development... But there\u2019s imagination, spectacle and thrills to spare.",
        "A playful and frantic science-fiction twister which mimics the best (Aliens, The Matrix, Groundhog Day) while offering something fresh and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 thrilling.",
        "The pleasure of Edge of Tomorrow is that it\u2019s not an action movie first and foremost, but rather a cheeky little puzzle picture in expensive-looking blockbuster drag.",
        "At its best, Edge of Tomorrow plays like a tripwire time-travel thriller. As it progresses, though, the built-in repetition can, and does, grow tedious.",
        "All in all, a perfectly superior example of industrially fortified Hollywood fun, and as good a guarantee as Doug Liman can offer that we haven\u2019t seen the last of him yet.",
        "The fact is that this is a pretty good summer-kablooie movie, and Cruise is better than pretty good in it.",
        "Offers a more satisfying cinematic experience than \"Oblivion.\"",
        "Edge of Tomorrow covers familiar ground with unexpected wit and economy, and the result is a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi fantasy.",
        "I'm not sure Edge of Tomorrow holds much repeat viewing potential among teenage movie consumers, since the movie's a self-repeating entity to begin with. But once is fun.",
        "Like summer movies themselves, it\u2019s become so easy to be glib in dismissing Tom Cruise. \u201cEdge of Tomorrow\u201d provides welcome and hugely entertaining evidence that he\u2019s still a star of considerable gifts, and savvy enough not to let them be squandered just yet.",
        "Edge of Tomorrow may be the best video game movie ever made. Which is strange since it isn't actually based on a video game.",
        "A Tom Cruise action flick with a strong female heroine and a sense of humor? Edge of Tomorrow has both of those, plus a \u201cGroundhog Day\u2019\u2019-style gimmick that pays big dividends. Over and over.",
        "It\u2019s probably no great loss, but here and elsewhere the seams show. And in this sort of movie it\u2019s often more fun before we get our bearings and have time to say, \u201cThis makes no sense.\u201d",
        "In Edge of Tomorrow, Mr. Liman brings Mr. Cruise\u2019s smile out of semiretirement and also gives him the kind of physical challenges at which he so brilliantly excels.",
        "They might also have called it \"Groundhog Day 2,\" but that wouldn't have conveyed the film's martial frenzy, its fascinating intricacies or the special delights of its borderline-comic tone.",
        "Edge Of Tomorrow\u2019s finale can\u2019t live up to what\u2019s come before, though that\u2019s mostly because what comes before is so rich and unusual, particularly in the middle of a summer blockbuster season that doesn\u2019t always value richness or novelty.",
        "The Wile E. Coyote fatalities are fun, but it's that repetitive moment of horror that holds this bipolar stunt together: Cruise, bug-eyed and gasping for breath as he shakes off his fear and grimly prepares for the next suicide mission.",
        "Cruise is better than he\u2019s been in a while because he damps down his usual all-intensity-all-the-time MO. He\u2019s best here when his character seems the most scared. And Emily Blunt as a commando legend is indomitable, a credit to her exoskeleton.",
        "Edge of Tomorrow is slick, but once its fancy plot dressing takes form, it has little more to offer aside from a few impressive action sequences and the infallible grin of its nimble lead.",
        "Cruise and Blunt have a measure of chemistry, however their characters go undeveloped, given short shrift amid the spectacle. But the pulse-pounding action scenes are briskly directed by Doug Liman.",
        "Tom Cruise's participation transmutes, as it always does, everything around him, turning the movie's series of false starts, dead ends, and hard lessons into a working metaphor for his own career.",
        "Cruise and Blunt have only as much chemistry as the script allows.",
        "Thank heavens, then, for the time-loop gimmick, which sustains a full hour of screen time with enough variations on its gambit to hook you in.",
        "The film\u2019s Groundhog Day-meets-Independence Day plot is actually pretty genius.",
        "Edge of Tomorrow isn\u2019t good, but it\u2019s also forgivable. Just please stop the \"Top Gun 2\" rumors, Tom. Please.",
        "By design it\u2019s monotonous, and with so much clunky hardware, Liman can\u2019t generate the same pace he produced in the \u201cBourne\u201d movies. Edge of Tomorrow has neither an edge nor a vision of tomorrow that matters today.",
        "I felt unable to decide between this movie is the most badass thing ever and OMG turn it off.",
        "This is an action flick for those who like form over substance in their popcorn movies which explode onscreen every summer.",
        "Although the humor helps, the Groundhog Day-like repetition gets tedious; it makes you feel more like a hamster than a groundhog \u2014 or rather a hamster's wheel, going round and round, over and over again.",
        "It is basically deadly serious, and after some moderate knockaboutfun, settles into something pretty dull. Where's the edge?"

However, I have to admit that I would've missed a lot had I not seen it. The plot might seem dull at first, especially when you think of Groundhog Day or Source Code, but this is, might I say, definitely one of the best science-fiction works ever. Period.\r Turns out Cruise still has the magic in him, but Blunt is pretty much the major reason why this movie resonates so well with the audience. Without any gigantic marketing gimmicks (in comparison to other summer releases), I really didn't expect the movie to be as good as it is.\r The visual effect is very smooth, the writing is definitely dashing, and for a movie about repetitions, I am surprised that I didn't even want to miss any scene because the humor, action, sci-fi lectures, and suspense work really well altogether. I expected X-Men: DoFP to be my favorite summer hit this year, but I have to say that this movie definitely steals the spotlight. I hope more people turn out to see it because it's something that you don't want to miss at all (despite the rather cliche ending).",

Basically it's Groundhog Day meets War of the Worlds.\r Now I'm a pretty big science fiction fan but I often don't like alien invasion films because the idea that humans are going to win a war against another alien invaders whose technology is hundreds of thousands of years more advanced than us usually falls to some ridiculous idea that although they traveled millions of light years to get here they forgot to check the air or the water before they started their invasion. Edge of tomorrow had a much more creative plot line, which really is the basis of the whole story.\r I liked the film so much that i went back to see it again with a friend.

It's very well directed, the editing is incredibly good, and the pace never lags, which is good for suspend disbelief Sci-Fi movies, one doesn't have time to think about plot holes. Cruise is good, and starts off well playing against stereotype as a sniveling coward. Blunt gets to be tough in a very sexual masculine/feminine role, and buff!

And if they're not... well you'll probably still like it, anyway. I wasn't particularly satisfied with the ending, but the movie never felt boring and as a whole, I enjoyed it very much. A welcome bi-product of the premise was the feeling that anything could happen to the main character at any time. Other movies often fail to deliver any real feeling of fear or surprise, given that you assume the main character will come out the other side with only a few scratches and bruises. But because the anchor of this story is repeatedly living a single day until he dies, the next fatal blow could be right around the corner. This film also provides some welcome realism in that our hero doesn't miraculously dodge every bullet or perform each maneuver perfectly the first time. I found that the filmmakers highlighted this very well and it provided some believability to an otherwise unbelievable story. At any rate, definitely worth my Saturday afternoon and money.",

Now to the review.\r Acting:\rI will begin by saying that the acting was top notch of course we have Tom Cruise who is Awesome and also Emily Blunt who was Fantastic. I thought the standout was Bill Paxton who was hilarious in the movie and also Brendan Gleeson who was also great with the few parts he had so acting was Superb.\r Story:\rThe story I thought was very well put together about the alien Invasion and by the end of the movie while there was still one question it was pieced together nicely.\r Action Scenes:\rThe action in this movie was Insane it was honestly non-stop from start to finish which I love for a movie like this take all the examples you have seen which combine Starship Troopers and the first scene in Saving Private Ryan and combine them and that is what you get an all out brawl of badass action scenes to rival these movies in particular which are Battle:LA and Battleship which I didn't watch because I heard it sucked but regardless if you love action movies this is def for you.\r Verdict:\rI would recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedy and action movies galore. I would say watch it in IMAX but if you can't just watch it in 2D this is the summer blockbuster to start the summer and possibly beat out all the rest and in my opinion is Tom Cruise's best film since my personnel favorite \"Collateral\"!!!!!

He strikes me as a second hand car salesman; too slick to be true. I had therefore no problem to picture him as the protagonist in this movie: an officer charged with speaking to the media: lacking any combat-experience and intent on staying as far away from any combat zone as possible. When ordered to join the troops in what his superior deems to be a walk-in-the-park landing, Tom blackmails his commander to let him off the hook, which severely backfires on him, for he finds himself soon stripped of rank among the first to land with the reputation of being a deserter who pretended to be an officer to escape his duty.\r The enemy are called mimics for reasons that are never explained in the movie. They resemble metal octopuses, who move at incredible speed, mostly underground. They are aliens and that is about all we learn about them and that is all we need to learn about them. It suffices that they are a deadly force hell-bent on wiping out humanity(some decades in the future, somebody will write a book about how these  inhuman threats are a sign of the times, just like 70s and 80s had their disaster movies).\rD-day quickly turns into a massacre as the aliens wipe out the human forces before they can gain a foothold. Tom dies too, but before he does, he manages to kill one of the rarest of mimics, and finds himself returned to life one day before the landing takes place. Baffled Tom goes through the same day and tries to intervene the course of action in a haphazard way. It doesn't matter that he does because everyone dies.. and he does to.\rAnd then finds himself alive and back in time again.\r And so it goes. With each cycle Tom gets better because he knows what will happen, but also has a lot of time to gain experience, but dies nevertheless again and again.\rHow does he get out of this predicament? He learns with each cycle and eventually he is aided by Emily Blunt, who has suffered from the same effects.\rUp till this sounds like a corny  predictable movie, but the script isn't as easy as you might think. The focus in this movie isn't on the humans vs aliens conflict, but on the interaction between Cruise and Blunt and their frantic efforts to turn the only advantage they have, foreknowledge, against the aliens. The key to their success is actually their ability to convince others that Tom possess that foreknowledge so that they help in the effort. And this is the hardest part.\r The script avoids giving us insight into the alien thinking. The mimics are kept as far away from the camera as possible and we never get a good clear view of them. This is smart for any alien eventually gets boring when shown too often.  An example is the landing, in which a lot of carnage happens before the aliens themselves actually show up.\rThe movie even throws us of the track by introducing a twist in the story that makes the aliens even more sinister. Perhaps everything has been planned beforehand?\r Yet there are flaws in the movie, such as the way Tom ends up in the combat zone. And also the ending is a bit contrived and clearly written to give us a good feel. There is nothing against a movie with a  good ending, but one that forced makes for a lesser ending.\rAlso one wonders why, having the possession of a flying craft at the start of the invasion, Tom and Blunt feel the need to have to get a car and a helicopter further land inward thus getting themselves killed time and again?\r Personally I think that the movie is at its best when Cruise and Blunt are together and it might have been more stronger if more time was to the group of people who aid him so that their characters would have mattered if and when they died.\rMy learning points about this movie would be that some more time could have spent characterizing the people who eventually will aid Tom. Spend less time on the battles in the landing zone and the repeating scenes(which in themselves are shot in a way as to avoid boring repetition, which ought to be mentioned) and give more time to the final attack.\r My ranking gives this a 7 out of 10. This needs an explanation: in it's genre this movie is a 9.. but since ranks are given not to genre or category they are given an overall score. In it's genre of action sci-fi it desevers something of a 9. Which means it is pretty good.",

AtEdge of Tomorrow is one of the most underrated Sci-Fi's in recent years and sadly it seems to have gone unnoticed by the majority. It remarkably manages to rip off so many films and video games whilst feeling refreshingly original also. At times it can feel like a game of spot the original source. In particular the time lapse elements which are very similar to Groundhog Day. If you over think the pattern and repetition of events, you can argue that there are flaws, as with any film of this kind. But it's smartly edited and it moves at such a rampant pace that you don't have time to dissect or question the flaws. Tom Cruise & Emily Blunt carry the film well and it's arguably Tom Cruise's best Sci-Fi to date. Visually this is a spectacular experience and the set pieces are some of the craziest and most exciting I've ever seen, in particular the battles on the beaches which are absolutely incredible. At first glance this just looks like another run of the mill action film with robots. Unlike the Transformers films for example, Edge of Tomorrow gets the human elements spot on and it doesn't rely solely on set pieces. But the set pieces happen to be spectacular too.

When I saw the poster the movie looked strange to me, and I know a lot of people hate Tom Cruise for some reason, but he's a great actor, I'm not big on his older movies but this one was completely organic. I don't know if it's just me but when I watched it again I fully understood what was happening, I noticed a lot of things I missed the first time, the movie is so meticulously written and it's one of those movies everyone has to see, it's up there with The Matrix and Dark Knight. The movie revolves around time travel, it's not vague like you often see in sci-fi where you don't really understand what's happening, it's simple like Groundhog Day, speaking of Groundhog Day this movie is very inspired by Groundhog Day. EoT will make you feel nostalgia, fear, joy, etc. I won't spoilerize anything, all I can say is that it's one of the best movies ever made, it's gritty, it's dark and they did a great job avoiding plot holes, something Days of Future Past was chalk-full of. Avoid the Angry Joe review, he spoils the **** out of every single thing he reviews, he always tells you what happens at the end which ruins the movie/game.\r + Gritty/Dark/Scary\r+ Great acting\r+ Great production\r+ Great plot\r- Not gory enough\r- Action scenes are kind of hard to make out sometimes\r- Music isn't great and memorable like Inception/Dark Knight/Matrix/etc. I always said that music makes a gargantuan difference in quality but this movie did just fine without it",

Plus, TomEdge of Tomorrow was originally not too big on my summer movie radar as much as films like Godzilla or Guardians of the Galaxy. However, after seeing some pretty cool trailers lately I decided this movie was worth a watch indeed. Plus, Tom Cruise still holds himself as masterful to this day. There's no denying that EoT is a fun watch, yet that doesn't keep the movie from having noticeable flaws. The premise is simple overall. Aliens have landed on Earth and begin to attack. Tom Cruise's place in this is that he is just someone who thinks of great weaponry for soldiers and plans attacks. He is not a soldier and he does not fight, and he especially notes this with a meeting with the general that basically tells him he must fight this one battle (not a spoiler). The way he dies in this battle makes him live the same day over and over every time he dies, hence the motto \"Live. Die. Repeat\". Some parts of the plot are extremely interesting, and some are dull. I liked how the romance between Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise was very light. Speaking of them, they both play their roles greatly, and like I said, Tom Cruise is excellent. The other characters aren't nearly as good, but are still OK. The action in this flick moves fast, and I loved it. Those mech suits specifically made for humans to fit into perfectly are sick. Plus, I loved the design of the aliens in the movie named Mimics, even though they looked a little like some types of Transformers. I found the writing in the movie to be clever, spicing it up with a bit of humor here and there. The locations where they filmed were also perfect for the movie. Let's move on to the evil little bugs in nearly every movie known as the flaws. There are big plot holes in this movie. There are times when Tom Cruise knows everything that is going to happen since he's lived this part before. I would have liked to see those scenes the first time through. And like I said, the other characters and some parts of the plot are uneven compared to the other great stuff. Side note: I saw this is in 3D because of my schedule, and I was surprised by how good it was. It is not mandatory by any means, but if you like 3D, I highly recommend it with this flick. My opinions with EoT were mixed, but I walked out thinking it was fun and good. A 7 out of 10, and that is good on my scale.",

Having seen the trailers, it just never interested me. Luckily, the good buzz surrounding it convinced me to see it and boy am I ever glad that it did. The film is funny, intriguing, well-acted, well-directed, and, ultimately, feels \"fresh\". The premise has been done before, the classic aliens invading Earth story and now they just added the the time looping element from Groundhog Day. No way this can be any good, right? Wrong. It may not be overally original on premise, but the way it handles these elements feels anything but tired and instead feels completely new, providing for a fun experience. Tom Cruise killed it in his role and Emily Blunt was just as great, if not better. In addition, the special effects are great and the action is done very well, never really growing tiresome. Heading into this one, I was worried that the time loop would become tiresome, but much like the material they have, it never felt tired. Every time he starts from the beginning, it feels fresh and like a totally new experience, even if it is not. The only two negatives I can really come up for this one are the beginning, which was a bit sketchy for me and had me questioning my decision to watch this one. Luckily, once the fllm kicks in, it is clearly much, much better. The ending is also a little iffy. It is not a total issue, but it bugs me enough to bring it up. If you have seen the film or when you see it, you will likely know what portion bugged me.",

C'mon, everyone loves the Pax Man and you can tell that here he is thoroughly enjoying his more-than-humorous roll. Advertising, why you do dis!?\r So Tom Cruise. 51 years old. Same ageless face. Same gigantic teeth. Kinda can't help but feel he was the reason this film isn't doing so well at the moment. Some people really dislike him and I feel he was a turnoff for the kind of audience that would love this film. Now personally, I don't mind the dude. Yeah he's full on 'MURICAN sometimes and the Scientology thing is... weird, at best, but surprisingly I liked him in this movie. Instead of the hands-on full-force gun-toting OTT super-soldier he usually plays, in Edge of Tomorrow we see a cowardly military officer who's a newcomer to any kind of warfare or combat. And it's fresh to say the least; the film is all about a nobody who, through the power of repeating the same events in a Groundhog Day style, becomes one awesome super hero almost by the end of the movie.\r You also got the aforementioned Bill Paxton, who is beautiful in every way, Emily Blunt as the 'Full Metal **** who's like an English Ellen Ripley, and a bunch of British misfits who are sometimes pretty cheesey, but overall a joy. The film is obviously quite Alien inspired (you get this idea from the moment you first see the Pax Man) as the Mech-suits and the weapons all feed that memorable tone. As I said before, Cruise repeats the same events while accumulating knowledge in a Groudhog Day style and the film is all about how he can stop this alien threat (they're called 'Mimics') by becoming more and more accustomed to the war that takes place. It's a fresh and inspired idea, the delivery is spot on, the humour throughout keeps the overall story from going stale and it's just all handled so well... Apart from the ending, which, while not really making that much of an impact negatively, is just 10 minutes that literally could not and should not exist. You'll see what I mean.\r This film is just so fun and awesome. It's not great, but as good as the next best thing. I would recommend this to fans of Alien, people who enjoy a little dark humour and those who wanna repeatedly see Tom Cruise get the **** beaten out of him.",

While they eventually show you a truncated version, you still see the entire thing far too many times. Despite suffering several quick and random deaths, the lead character was able to survive some pretty fantastic things late in the film.
