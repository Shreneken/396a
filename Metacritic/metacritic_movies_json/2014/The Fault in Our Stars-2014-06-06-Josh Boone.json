  "rating": 7.4,
  "release_date": "2014-06-06",
  "summary": "Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Gus (Ansel Elgort) are two extraordinary teenagers who share an acerbic wit, a disdain for the conventional, and a love that takes them on an unforgettable journey. Their relationship is all the more miraculous, given that they met and fell in love at a cancer support group.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Director Josh Boone does a wonderful job of celebrating the sentimentality without shying away from the tough moments. The pacing, music and editing are all first-rate.",
    "The Fault in Our Stars beautifully captures the hesitancy, shyness masked by outward confidence, feelings of unworthiness and quiet intensity of teenagers in love.",
    "The Fault in Our Stars may not show the true messiness of cancer, but it does grapple with death and the ability to survive great loss. Maybe that's enough truth for one movie.",
    "The movie is well-written, well-acted, acerbic, funny and wisely observed. Fans of the book will be glad to hear it is faithful to Green's tale.",
    "The details are what matters, and the script by Scott Neustadter & Michael H. Weber, adapted from the well-loved novel by John Green, is very smart and fairly unsentimental, which works to the material's advantage.",
    "The Fault in Our Stars wins points for being more complex and stylish than most similar films feel they need to be. Most movies with this target audience are maudlin and manipulative, but Boone's film never feels like it's trying too hard to win our tears—or our laughter.",
    "Despite a few missteps this is a spirited, touching romance and Shailene Woodley’s best performance yet. Divergent fans after a weepie need look no further.",
    "Though supported by Woodley’s subtle narration, The Fault in Our Stars is relentlessly outward. That’s part of the book’s inspiring touch, and even if some of the supporting cast comes off as merely functional onscreen, the core of the tragedy comes to life in a heartbreaking way.",
    "When the time comes for suffering, the pain of watching her is mingled with the pleasure of a performance that transcends contrivance. This young actress is the real, heart-piercing thing.",
    "Hazel and Augustus will live in film lore because of the young actors who play them.",
    "The film works on only one level, but so completely on that level that the rest doesn’t seem to matter: Woodley and Egort have terrific chemistry.",
    "The layered, tuned-in adaptation by Michael H. Weber and Scott Neustadter avoids calculated sentiment.",
    "While The Fault In Our Stars is more pastel watercolor than hard-edged drama, it’s still hugely warm and winning, thanks in large part to Boone’s unfussy, wistful direction.",
    "The film has enough charm and humor to keep it appealing to a wide audience, and dumbing things down doesn’t feel particularly smart or canny, and proves to be a minor distraction to an otherwise majorly entertaining feature.",
    "Elgort’s performance is more mannered than Woodley’s open-faced, direct line to the heart, but it works.",
    "Maybe it's generational: In a movie about teens, it's the teens who should rule.\r\nAnd they do. With certainty. With laughter. And with tears - buckets and buckets.",
    "The ultimate feel-good movie about feeling bad. And within those limits, it succeeds all too well.",
    "The acting is top-notch, the characters are three-dimensional, and the dialogue is sharp and witty.",
    "Best of all, the film never makes its characters into stoic or tragic heroes, choosing instead to highlight what makes them human — their hopes, their fears, their anger, the way they learn to live with knowing they’re going to die.",
    "Green made the wise choice to be funny in telling his sad story.",
    "It's nothing you'd ever want to put yourself through twice, and yet it's effective in the moment. Shrewdly prefabricated and yet lovingly assembled, it is, in short, the most beautifully made cynical thing I've ever seen.",
    "A wise, warm, funny and touching romantic drama.",
    "Good movies are made out of great books all the time, and to fault Fault for not living up to its inspiration isn’t much more fair than dismissing the novel on the grounds that it sounds, superficially, like \"Love Story\" for millennials. As with infinities, some successes are just bigger than others.",
    "You get compassion and intelligence instead of cracker-barrel homilies. And you get mesmerizing performances.",
    "I couldn't help wondering what kind of spiky unpredictability a \"Say Anything\" - era John Cusack would have brought to the character — with or without the requisite Peter Gabriel song.",
    "What sustains the film through the rockier times are its challenging themes, offering real issues for the young protagonists to wrestle with, rather than whether anyone will be carded trying to buy beer.",
    "The film does, however, have the best weapon in the world against the perception of slickness: an actress without a smidgen of actressiness.",
    "The Fault in Our Stars is manipulative as can be, pulling out all the stops — kids with cancer — in its attempt to bring the tears. And you know what? It works.",
    "The greatest strengths of the film clearly come from Green’s novel, which resolutely refuses to become a cliched cancer drama, creating instead two vibrant, believable young characters.",
    "Director Josh Boone is hardly the most distinctive cinematic stylist, but he’s smart enough to let his scenes linger for a few beats longer than most mainstream directors would, and seems to trust his actors to carry their own dramatic weight.",
    "The fault is not in the stars -- they're fine -- it's in the way they're put through what amounts to emotional overkill.",
    "Boone’s unobtrusive style takes cues from the subdued nature of the material, but there’s little about the movie that makes the filmmaking stand out. Instead, it derives its chief strengths from a series of efforts to take the drama seriously, mainly embodied by Woodley’s onscreen investment in it.",
    "Intelligent and earnest, The Fault in Our Stars works well enough to keep a doubter from feeling mugged by sentiment.",
    "Shailene Woodley, already a subtle and rangy actress, easily carries the film as Hazel.",
    "Woodley and Dern breathe a ghost into the machine. Willem Dafoe has fun, albeit not too much, in a brief, vital role as a creepy writer. Most crucially, the words that survived from Green’s novel did so for a reason.",
    "The Fault in Our Stars doesn't quite capture the discreetly twisted humor, or the muted anger, of Green's book, and its problems can be attributed to a constellation of little annoyances rather than any one serious, North Star–size flaw.",
    "I expected, even wanted to cry at The Fault in Our Stars, or at least choke up a little. Yet the transparent eagerness of this movie to break hearts, through means not entirely justifying that end, always pulled me back.",
    "For all the film’s best intentions — and a finely tuned performance from the ever-better Woodley — for me The Fault in Our Stars never entirely found its way out of Sparks territory.",
    "Fault is at heart a full-throttle, by-the-numbers tearjerker.",
    "Woodley is an ace at handling laughter through tears — \"my favorite emotion,\" as a character in \"Steel Magnolias\" once said. She improves with each new film, even when the films themselves aren't much.",
    "The film version of the best-selling novel The Fault in Our Stars feels emotionally inert, despite its many moments that are meant to put a lump in our throats.",
    "Though it is a tragic love story, it is also a perfect and irresistible fantasy.",
    "Sweet, cute to the point of cutesy.",
    "It takes few chances, frequently using sass as a smokescreen, hiding what's unoriginal and cheaply sentimental about this story behind a veil of witticisms about oblivion and \"cancer perks.\"",
    "This movie is so tone-deaf it would only make sense in Vincent van Gogh’s missing ear."

During an early screening of the alluring teenage film adaptation of John Green’s novel The Fault In Our Stars, I was surely the minority of the sexes. To be honest, I don’t think I knew exactly how outnumbered I was until the film’s tragic scenes unfolded, delivering a current of waterworks and overwhelmingly loud wails of screaming, crying and sniffling, predominantly from female audience members. This early screening of the film was jam-packed, and had me sitting only a row away from the massive screen. If Josh Boone’s film adaptation of The Fault In Our Stars taught me anything, it’s to never underestimate the power of teenage girls and their ability to pack theaters and show their support for films and books they love.\r The Fault In Our Stars is guilty of possessing a number of faults, but its biggest sin lies in its persistence to aspire to be greater than it actually is. It succeeds when it exposes us to the tragic relationship between its protagonists and the loved ones around them, and fails when it aspires to find new territory of plot and redemption for characters that are already born with unlimited amounts of pathos.\r Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) is as much a teenage girl as any other living in the United States. Her love of reality television, reading and curiosity of the taboo is just as strong as other girls within America. The only difference: Hazel Grace has terminal cancer. The Fault In Our Stars should be a film about cancer and how it effects the people surrounded by it (think 50/50), but it becomes overwhelming with its fascination to overly glamorize the telling of a tainted love story, therefore becoming a love story about people with cancer (think A Walk To Remember).\r From the beginning, love, life and happiness are overshadowed by impending doom, and that is perhaps the problem with the film. No matter how much you fall in love with Hazel Grace or Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), their fates are sealed. Green’s novel may have been about telling a heart-breaking love story between young teens, but much like Hazel’s fascination with her favourite book and the open endedness of a certain literary character, Hazel’s happiness is less about coming to terms with death, and more about the continuation of the life of her loved ones. The interactions with the people who will survive and live well beyond Hazel’s existence are never given their due diligence on-screen, especially her mother (played delicately by Laura Dern), always being pushed aside by the love story that will ultimately end in unhappiness and tears.\r There is sure to be a reason why Green’s novel has becomes such a pop culture sensation. The film is said to be a somewhat loyal adaptation, brimming with very clever metaphors of life and death through dialogue and foreshadowing. It does a masterful job of **** the most average looking parks, backyards and parking lots, and makes great use of its supporting actors. Sadly, the two actors that have the most screen time are the two weakest components of the film. Woodley, who is slowly following in the footsteps of Emma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence, seems to play Hazel Grace less, and herself more. With the exception of her chopping off her hair and having an oxygen tank follow her around everywhere she goes, Woodley only taps the surface of her character Hazel Grace, barely gracing audiences with the brilliance radiating with the promise of such a philosophically pessimistic character.\r Elgort, who comes off as a character who is easy to fall in love with, shows much of his charm and promise as a young actor. Elgort as Waters shimmers with potential, delivering a performance of a person who may be a little too cherry and perfect, given sad circumstances.\r Green had said to gain the inspiration of the novel by working as a student chaplain at a children’s hospital. Drawn to the exuberant life of its terminally ill patients, Green is quoted as saying he wanted to write a book about people who were constantly being dehumanized, while showcasing the abundance of humanity in people with a terminal illness. The film does an excellent job of making audiences believe that love is what keeps Hazel and Augustus alive. Love becomes the answer, but only for so long before the inevitability of death at the end of a terminal illness takes hold. There is a point where love exists, and people fade in the film, and although the relationships that held strong are bonded by love, hope of an improbably oblivion becomes the films main concern.\r The Fault In Our Stars can be self-assured as being a quality film made for an audience that would be content with half-assed filmmaking. The production quality and storytelling is top-notch, even if its is constantly emotionally manipulating.",

This is objectionable on nearly every level. Based on a best selling book it can claim as its own a lead female character who is, oh so, with it and everyone calls her by, not one, but two names- Hazel Grace, if you will! It also has a cool male lead and we know this because he goes around with an unlit cigarette between his teeth as a metaphor for life and death. So far, so vomit inducing, and that's just for starters. The screenplay and dialogue is so saccharine that diabetes sufferers should steer well clear.\rShailene Woodley, reminding one of a young Debra Winger in her manner, is obviously capable of handling better material, but is only ok under such unfair circumstances. However, in the male lead Ansel Elgort is just annoying. The film is also desperately overlong and the scenes involving Willem Dafoe just don't work at all. We are also treated to an embarrassing first kiss between the two leads in the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam, which actually has the other visitors applauding and tips the film into bathos.\rThe lack of empathy one feels for the characters is also underlined by a syrupy score and some of the worst songs to be heard in a film for quite some time. At one point Woodley says that a nurse once asked her on a scale of 1-10 where she would rate her pain. I would have to disagree with her 9 and say my pain level was at the 10 mark. This is the sort of film you wish they didn't make anymore and the critics that have praised it, enticing my viewing, leave me baffled.",

I'm not a typical schultz when it comes to sappy romantic novels, or love stories of any genre. To be honest, they inflame me. Setting up unrealistic approaches to how \"love\" is supposed to be.\rIn the end, someone is left dead or crying. Now, before I start to sound like a weeping school girl, I give you the film \"The Fault In Our Stars\" which I must say.. is a rare, rare exception. A film that never exploits itself too much, and has relentless humor that perfectly balances the fatal backdrop. I have not read the acclaimed novel from author John Green. However, In the days leading up to this screening, I had heard nothing but positive things about the book. It's clear now after seeing the film, what a tremendous band of characters, and a touching story that Green has vastly created..and to him I say well done.\r The movie chronicles the events of Hazel Grace Lancaster, a sixteen year old, dealing with the everyday struggle of living with her terminal (but treatable) cancer. With no friends and nothing look to forward to in life, The film also follows the unforgettable journey of love when she meets Augustus Waters, a likeable and pretentious eighteen year old that is persistent and charming. The two instantly hit it off, and form a bond that is unbreakable. To the point that nothing can separate them. Co-existing in each others lives, and finding the true meaning of each other.\r We can't have this film, if not for our stunning and talented leads. You may remember the pair as on screen siblings in the film adaptation of \"Divergent\" that came out earlier this year. But, \"true\" audience members are going to remember them for playing, Hazel Grace Lancaster, and Augustus Waters. I'm talking about Shailene Woodley, and her trustful leading man Ansel Elgort. The two are miraculous to watch on screen together, easily the best chemistry between any romance since, Rachel McAdams & Ryan Gosling in \"The Notebook\". (Yes I've seen that movie too...shocking I know). Ansel Elgort is truly coming into his own as a delicate performer. However, this time around the film belongs to Woodley and her mastery of Hazel Grace. So much passion, so much raw material infused into her grief stricken performance, that ..dare I say.. brought me to tears. Hazel is such a fragile character, and you understand this within the opening credits. The mental stability and such all seemed to come natural to Woodly, whom made me feel so much within a two hour time frame. Great supporting work also comes from long time favorite Willem Dafoe, as well as, Laura Dern, Nat Wolff and Sam Trammell. They round out the film and make it feel whole.\r Woodley was undoubtedly good...yes, but we can't say it's nothing without Ansel Elgort and his charismatic charm, memorable metaphors and wit he brings to the character of Augustus Waters. In addition, this film is only going to be as good are your two leads, and that's usually where the problem lies, this is never the case in this film. Director Josh Boone gets the most out of his performers and writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Webber do the justice (I believe) is deserved. Of course, as history would have it, I assume the book is better.\r In Comparison we look at other films like \"The Vow\", \"Safe Haven\" and even \"Endless Love\" ..was there anything here to create a likeable basis?..that didn't stumble into a crate of dumbfoundedness..and horrendous stupidity?. Those films are not love stories..there simply are films attempting to create one. Besides a film like \"The Notebook\", and \"The Fault In Our Stars\" only come along every so often.. It's sad that a film like \"The Vow\" was based on an actual true story..and. do in heavy to the belligerents of the director and cast, I didn't believe it for a second. Our Director, Josh Boone takes these giant cliches and simply washes away with them, inflicting some strong emotional damage, and a film you think about long after leaving your local multiplex.\r Anyone that has ever dealt with cancer, the loss of a loved one, anything tough of this latitude in general will feel a resounding connection with this film. Even for folks that haven't read the book (like myself). \"The Fault In Our Stars\" is deeply moving and swiftly upbeat all the same, which is saying alot for me. The movie perfectly balances it's tough subject matter. The only problem I couldn't get over..was that Shailene Woodley did look a little too older to be playing a quote on quote \"sixteen year old\", which didn't ruin the film..it just hurt the credibility a little bit.\r As stated earlier, it's extremely rare to come across such a love story that can evoke a genuine feel that doesn't seem dated or overly excessive. A story that is entertaining but not preachy. You either buy into it, or you don't. Thanks to strong leads, a bunch of talented crew members, writers and directors that brought this all together. \"The Fault In Our Stars\" works on a grander scale as a whole, and if this film doesn't pull on your heartstrings. I don't know what will.\r A\r By: Nate Adams\r Directed By: Josh Boone\rRated: PG13\rRuntime: 126 mins\rStudio: Fox\rRelease Date: June 6th 2014\r Thanks For Stopping By.",

It’s the best book to movie adaptation I’ve seen in a long time. I say this because it avoids both book and movie clichés, nicely, while offering a fresh look at the teen’ romance genre.\r Director, Josh Boone tells the story of a sixteen-year-old cancer patient played flawlessly by Shailene Woodley. Woodley’s character is forced to attend a support group where she meets a boy. They quickly become friends and we watch as their relationship blossoms into something more. The boy-meets-girl plot may be old, but it’s far from stale.\r Gripping, realistic characters and down to earth stories helped ground the messages in this movie. Never once did the ideas brought up in the film feel forced. The creators did an excellent job at leaving the big questions about life up to the interpretation of the viewers. Yet enough of the simple plot points were answered to leave us satisfied.\r The acting was brilliant and made the whole film work. Each character was likable and had arcs; whether they were important to the story or not, they were still entertaining.  The dialogue was realistic throughout the movie, creating an immersive experience that carried viewers into the world of the characters.\r Unfortunately, the film did suffer some off-beat moments and a few scenes felt slightly prolonged. There were also a handful of tear-jerking scenes toward the end, that came across as forced.\r The Fault in Our Stars offers great performances that are well worth the watch, and the heartfelt story is one that will make you stop and evaluate life. Put this film on your must-watch list of 2014.",

Interestingly, both the films dealt with writers, but the main themes were romance. He's just a two movie old and now the movie goers can expect eagerly for his next venture. This movie was based on the teen novel of the same name about a 16-years-old cancer patient.\r Hazel Grace, who is battling between life and death is also a strong fighter against all the odds. When her mother sends her to attend the group therapy she meets Augustus Water, a fellow member. As she is being sarcastic, Waters finds an interesting character in her. A friendship develops and they spend more time together. Even knowing there will no future together, the relationship progress and how everything ends is the rest.\r Usually cancer themed movies are called tearjerker films. Surprisingly, this movie's aim was different. Of course emotion strikes, but the story narration and character developments were the basic goal. Three-fourth of the movie was well told story about teen romance. The afterwards account begins with a twist which were portrayed in the usual manner. Like all the movies, kept sentiments in the last part. The last quarter was very predictable, but they avoided cliche as much possible.\r ‘‘Apparently, the world is not\ra wish-granting factory.’’\r The parents' role was kind of mysterious one, that diverts viewer from their anticipation. Interesting it also creates some doubts. Compared to the previous movie 'The Spectacular Now', Shailene Woodley looked completely different. That means the physical transformed to look a perfect 16 year old was amazing. Her performance as well gives an impression that the Hollywood's future Academy award grabbing the female lead is on making. At this rate she can do that like Jennifer Lawrence did.\r As for the lead actor, it is a good breakthrough and expecting the same result from his next movie as well. This movie, which runs over a 2 hour was smartly sliced the contents and organized those on the right spots. Many had agreed it was a fine cinema transformation from a book. So you can try this, but be careful because nowadays most of the teens movies are overrated because of the overwhelmed teen audience. The warning meant only for the older people. I'm sure the youngster will love this movie, I mean most of them.",

It is based on a book by the same title written by John Green.\r Hazel, played by Shailene Woodley, and Augustus, played by Ansel Elgort have two completely different characters. Hazel is very pessimistic, depressed, asocial, and melancholic. Augustus is optimistic, cheerful, convivial, and funny. As their love story progresses their characters change. Hazel starts to see bright sides of the world and Augustus gives up his super ambitious dreams and becomes more realistic.\r Not every director is brave enough to step into the territory of showing the daily life of terminally ill people but this territory is also easily manipulative. Josh Boone should be praised for his courage for directing “The Fault in Our Stars” and puts many engaging moments and a good takeaway message in the movie but it does not mean his work has no shortcomings.\r The main problem with the movie is the poor script adaptation. The movie relies less on the visual presentations and more on Hazel's monologues to narrate the story. Instead of seeing events in the movie, we mostly hear them (or we see them and then unnecessarily hear them).  A better script adaptation could have transformed more of the oral narrations into more engaging visual narrations. Moreover, cliché sentences like “I love you” and “You are beautiful” appear in the movie over and over without adding anything new to the story. The ultimate message of the movie is excessively highlighted with excessive dialogues and performances.\r The second problem with this movie is far-from-perfect performances. The supporting actors and actresses in the movie pull out good performances but the leading actor and actress are not convincing. The Augustus' ever-present smile and his never-disturbed coolness feels unreal and sometimes annoying. Still, it seems the script is to blame here. Performances are not the only part of the movie that feel fake and unreal. The whole story about Hazel and Augustus's last wish and how they consummate their love is so fake that I couldn't help but to keep closing my eyes through it.",

This movie does not deserve a perfect 10 (it's no 12 Years a Slave or Pulp Fiction), but it does deserve some credibility where it earned it— the cinematography and the acting,  most notably. Both leads did a wonderful job selling their characters. Unfortunately, however (and this may just be a critique of the book rather than the movie), the plot was somewhat flawed. For one, the movie (unlike the book) didn't explain why the father wasn't more of a prominent figure, whereas the mother was heavily involved. That's a simple flaw, and not one worth giving a lower score for. What does alter my score, however, are the multiple plot cliches found throughout the movie, as well as film cliches. There was, of course!, the typical 'grab something at the same time and touch our hands \"accidentally\" ' cliche. What I do commemorate is the slight plot twist: (DON'T READ THIS SENTENCE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE OR READ THE BOOK) most people would probably assume that Hazel would die, rather than Gus. So that was a nice gut-buster. Overall, apart from the cliches and ultimate goal of causing the audience to flood the theater in their own tears, the movie was entertaining and inspiring (as well as the book, obviously). It reminds me of Perks of Being a Wallflower, but not quite as good. It was an interesting take on a 21st century coming-of-age film (which is how I understood it to be, but with a touch of cancer). As a film, this movie deserves between a 5.5-6.5; as modern entertainment, this movie deserves an 8-9. Recommended but not praised.",

It was almost like they were shouting at you and saying \" We WILL find SOMETHING to make you FEEL!\" The leads eventually wear on you and their wit and off-beat humor get old. I found myself wanting them to just shut up during some of the scenes.",

But I did want to watch it!  At the end of 2015 I prepared myself to just enjoy the movie and shut out the pain, suffering, etc.  Best movie I had seen in over a year!  I have seen it since that first viewing and I never grow tired of it.  It isn't depressing, it is life affirming.  The writers did a fantastic job getting in so much good, valuable material but never taking their focus off the main point.  It is so much more that a love story, a heartbreaking story, a life affirming story it is just glorious.  I am constantly surprised at my normal reactions to movies I see, I don't normally seem to get out of most movies what other people take away from them, but in this case I hope people watch the movie and pay attention to every part of it.  This isn't a movie you want to get side tracked while watching.  I think the last movie I rated a 10 was \"Sound of Music\", although maybe a couple others through the years.  The idea that this was a \"sappy\" movie or any other such adjective just means that either the person wasn't \"open\" to the movie, didn't feel the depth of emotions of all kinds, didn't pay attention or possibly just hasn't lived enough life to begin to see what the movie offered.  I don't remember crying at all, I was a little too busy staying focused on everything else going on in the movie.  The movie \"Dying Young\" with all it's great acting, story and everything else just doesn't come close to this movie.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \n#1 Best-selling novel, The Fault in Our Stars, written by John Green, was turned into a cinematic success in June of 2014. This beautifully written, yet agonizing story has a superior storyline, as well as a thought provoking plot seen throughout the film. The intriguing love story has its ups and downs, in which the film director has done a phenomenal job at showing, while keeping the audience at the edge of their seats begging to know more. (Spoiler Alert!)\rHazel Grace Lancaster, played by Shailene Woodley, is perceived as an outcast. A teenage girl who longs to live a life to the fullest but struggles to do so. As a thirteen year old, Hazel was diagnosed with cancer, forcing her to lug around a oxygen tank wherever she goes. When she meets Augustus (Gus) Waters, played by Ansel Elgort, at a cancer support group she instantly falls in love. Augustus is an outspoken seventeen year old who wishes to be remembered on the Earth but also jokes here and there about his prosthetic leg (in which he lost due to cancer). Throughout their journey of true love, it is clear to the audience that happily ever after isn’t an option for this pair of teenagers. The couple -and us- are taken on an emotional roller coaster filled with the ups and downs of cancer, love, and ultimately, living.\rAlthough the film is based on the novel, the words don’t seem to fit in with the generation. As an audience member, the film seemed thrown together and very unrealistic (nobody travels across the world to meet their favorite author, just to receive the answers to the final questions of the book). Similar to the romantic film We Got Mail, it lacks the flair and originality everybody is wanting in a new film. The teenagers have their own “forever and always” like every romantic film has. “Okay” is used to make the romance stronger, yet it takes away the realistic romance the author, John Green, does exceptionally well at making clear in the novel. Although based on the novel, the film seemed to be a mirror image with no sudden surprises or unexpected twists in the plot, making it seem very plain and lacking the flair that romantic films such as The Notebook and Dear John have.\rWhile other times, the romantic sayings such as “I fell in love like you fall asleep, slowly then all at once,” and “perhaps okay will be our always,“ precisely placed into scenes make the audience long for a happily ever after for the two love struck teenagers. During the emotional scenes, the silence was always filled with pop alternative music (“All I Want” -Kodaline), which formed a lump in your throat causing it to swell up as the scene intensifies. Throughout the entire film, you are left to question the meaning of the characters decisions, one thing I loved about John Green’s storyline. As a couple they learn “the world is not a wish granting factory,” something that may seem irrelevant right away but serves a purpose throughout the couples journey. Many lessons are taught to this young group of people, many of which make the audience question the amount of things they have taken for granted in their lives. Towards the end of the film, all of the questions wandering around in your head are answered in the most unexpected way.\rThis beautiful cinematic success focuses on romance, the struggle of wanting to be a normal teenager, as well as worrying about the oblivion, something that Gus does constantly. Throughout the journey of the two teenagers’ love story, many lessons are learned and many hearts are broken. Just like Hazel’s favorite book An Imperial Affliction stated “Pain demands to be felt.” It is safe to say this film left the audience heartbroken.",

A fantastic adaptation of a beautiful book by John Green that is skillfully directed by Josh Boone. Never maudlin, and delicately handled drama, \"Fault\" makes you appreciate life, love, and the simple moments that make up our life. Shailene Woodley is amazing in this film. She inhabits this character so fully that it is hard to not emotionally invest in her from the get go. She isn't afraid to expose her emotions and let the story unfold. Ansel Elgort is also a brilliant star shining in the \"Fault\" universe. He understands this beloved character and creates a nuanced, later raw performance that is not only impressive, but awe inspiring. A brave actor and truly talented man. The scene on the bench in Amsterdam between the two actors should be studied in master classes for actors. The rest of the cast also meld into their respective characters wonderfully and round out this phenomenal story. A gifted soundtrack that not only adds to the film, it draws the audience in. This kind of film is important to make. It truly affirms that love isn't perfect and neither is life, you do not get a say in your circumstances, but you can control your reaction and the effect they have on it. Life is messy and emotional and \"Fault\" never takes advantage of the audience. This isn't a tearjerker, this is an emotion evoker. Boone brings this beloved story to life and with our hearts and minds.",

That both have cancer, hers in the metastatic stage and his in remission, is handled lightly though it is a major theme as to what happens. Watching Gus and Hazel Grace fall in love just brings smiles to your face as she fights it and knows it is inevitable.\r As her parents Laura Dern and Sam Trammell are supportive, caring and, knowing they have a strong daughter, don’t baby her. Gus’s best friend Isaac, played by Nat Wolff, who also has cancer, brings black humor that relieves a few heavy moments.\r About midway in the movie the production moves to Amsterdam and it will certainly bring many more tourists as they want to follow where Gus and Hazel Grace have a romantic dinner or cruise along the canals the lovers travel plus visit the Anne Frank house and memorial, not to mention the hotel---oh, oh that would be a spoiler!!!\r The only part of the film where the director, Josh Boone, and screenplay writers, Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber based on the book by John Green, go astray is when it comes to the story line, acted by William DaFoe as an author and Lotte Verbeek as his assistant, which also adds a false note to the ending.\r I had expected a tear jerker---come on--teens with cancer--from beginning to end but Woodley and Elgort don’t let you dwell on that with Elgort’s exuberance for life and Woodley as natural an actress that puts her up there with Jennifer Lawrence.\r There was a twist near the end that surprised me but we get to meet another couple of real parents in David Whalen and Milica Govich.\r “The Fault In Our Stars” is a beautiful love story that will bring tears to your eyes but not the depression you would expect in a story about teens with cancer.",

It’s a touching love story that really pulls on the heartstrings and manages to make prolific statements on life and what we as humans should do with such an amazing gift. That we are not bound by the life we are given and we can do whatever we want so as long as we don’t let our circumstances bind us.\r I am really impressed by this films script and how thought provoking and heartfelt it is. The relationship and the genuine emotions are so well written that not for a second I don’t believe what they are saying or feeling towards one another. I also enjoy how it doesn’t take a strong sentimental or sappy approach on the subject matter, as these characters are really sick and it could have come off as trying way too hard or manipulative. The script instead focuses on celebrating life as apposed to the darker side of death.\r The director, Josh Boone, does a good job with handling everything that is going on and directs the cast well, as they are the strongest parts of the film. I really enjoy some of the stylistic approaches in the film, such as how they show the text messages. One small fault in his directing is that the film gets a bit conventional near the end and it manages to lose some of its magic. The soundtrack is well used and really drives the movie home. It’s filled with upbeat and fun songs that really makes the film feel like a celebration of life.\r The cast is top class and they truly give some wonderful performances. Shailene Woodley gives a magical performance that conveys genuine happiness and heartbreaking sadness. She easily portrays so many emotions realistically and convincingly. Ansel Elgort plays Woodley’s love interest and if not done by such a good actor, he could have come off as annoying and in your face. His character is a bit loud and egotistic, but he is a nice guy and really loves everyone, who he encounters. Woodley’s and Elgort’s onscreen chemistry is incredibly good. I really bought their relationship and felt every pain that they felt. The actors are a true highlight of the film.\r Overall, “The Fault In Our Stars” is a really good movie that is a fresh of breath air in this summer blockbuster season filled with high octane action and ridiculous special effect. It’s a emotional ride that does not force it’s message or manipulates its  audience. It is a genuine movie that shows a brighter side of life and death. While the film does get conventional in it’s third act, it still ends on a high note. I give it an incredibly high 4/5",

I plan to get around to doing that eventually. I was expecting a lot of cliches and a lot of cheesy, overwrought emotionalism. Yes, there was some of that, but it didn't end up bothering me in the way I expected it to. Yes, this movie is very sad, but I think everyone will know this going into it, regardless of whether or not they have read the book. It is, after all, a love story about 2 individuals with cancer that starts by explaining that love stories aren't the way you see them in the books. There are a couple of amusing ironies like this throughout, because, of course, this is a book, or movie, so, by definition, this is how love is portrayed in the books and movies. Later in the movie, a character named Gus wishes to be remembered, and worries he will not be, and Hazel remarks that like all the best love stories, it will die with the two of them. Of course, this is false, because their love story is enshrined in a wildly popular novel and now a movie.\rAnyways, this movie likes to tow the line between cheesy cliches and genuinely heartbreaking emotion. It does a great job. There will be the occasional line that makes you cringe a tiny bit because you feel like you've heard it in hundreds of love stories before, and it's not getting any more original. But then there will be a line or two that pleasantly surprises you with its originality. Similarly, there are a lot of subplots that end exactly the way you would expect them to, but there are several that don't. For instance, the subplot regarding the favorite author of Hazel ends differently than I had expected, and this pleased me, and a certain eulogy a certain character reads also takes a different turn than I had expected. And despite this being primarily a teenage love story, I found Hazel's interactions with her parents to be some of the most powerful scenes in the movie. Between some of the doomed love story cliches, moments like this keep popping up and surprising the viewer, and, by the end of the movie, I was left feeling that the movie's originality, for the most part, overshadowed its cliches. You might leave the theater feeling a little bit miserable inside, but, for me, that's okay, because the emotional rollercoaster was worth it, and we all knew somebody was going to die in a movie about a romance between two teens with severe Cancer, one of whom is depressed and the other of whom is obsessed with defying Cancer through cheesy symbolism involving cigarettes. Also, a certain blind character provides comedic relief in an otherwise intense movie. So, yeah. It was good. Not the best movie I've ever seen. Not even close. Probably not in the top five or maybe even ten movies of the year, but it was good, and it was worth my time.",

She meets Ansel Elgort in a support group and they proceed to fall in love. The witty, sometimes overwritten, dialogue is part of the film's charm, but the bulk of the appeal comes from the tall, baby-faced Elgort, who's cute, charismatic and charming. Woodley is OK, but looks too old for her role. While I'm sure fans of the book (which I haven't read) will be thrilled and touched, the story continues too long after it felt finished and mires itself in misery. Still, it may be worth it to see Elgort in a career-making performance.",

Even the adult that witnesses her own car being vandalized is just like \"okay whatever\" and goes back inside. With that being said, most of the adults in this movie are pushovers giving into anything the kids want or say. That's while the kids show advanced articulation and deeper thoughts. What parent lets even a healthy kid take a trip like that, especially after seeing \"Taken\" a few years ago. This film is also plagued with semantics that are just mistakes, like the family leaving for a vacation and forgetting the close the front door to the house, or them climbing a ladder making a big deal for her making it but saying nothing about the 1 legged boyfriend. I guess nobody cared about him anyways. Just take your girlfriend to see this one so she can have a good cry like Tom Cruise did this weekend when he saw the box office charts.",

It's not a weepy in the classic sense because I never felt that they were trying to make me cry. The direction and the two main performances really shy away from simply treacly excess. The film is way too long by about 25 minutes but the director and two stars deserve huge kudos for keeping it real. Shailne Woodley is adorable, wonderful and honest. Equally, Ansel Elgort is a really interesting choice for the male lead. He's not pretty by today's standards and a bit of an awkward lug. Not at all what you expect from an actor in this role.

That's why I give it a 6/10. It's far from being a bad film, but it wasn't very special either. I read the amazing book few days before watching the film, and I have to say that the book was breathtaking and deeply emotional. It is filled with lots of funny moments and also, painfully sad moments. The last chapters made me feel so many emotions at once. Then appears this mediocre and sometimes heartless adaptation. It was so disappointing because it does not reach that emotional impact from the book. The movie feels so rushed (even with its 126 minutes of running time).\r It was so straight to the point, there was not enough character development. My major issue with this film is that each scene feels so mediocre and emotionally empty. Also, when it tries to be funny ends up being awkwardly humorless. Another problem is the lazy screenplay, the writer changed a huge part of the original script and some of the scenes were so badly scripted and awfully directed. I mean, the actions and the way that this talented actors interacted between each other in dramatic scenes were not similar to the book at all. What a shame because the book took more risks. It was braver.\r Another problem is that there were not enough characters. A lot of important characters from the book were not in the film. Come on, the director had enough running time to put them in, but he didn't. Also, I didn't feel that connection between Hazel, Gus, and that book called \"An Imperial Affliction\". You don't know anything about this book that they love, they just barely talked about it throughout the film and there were not enough conversations about this beloved book in the film. But I'm happy that there were some decent moments here. All the scenes in Amsterdam were beautifully shot and very similar to the book in all the right ways. It was definitely the best part of the movie.\r All those moments in Amsterdam were very enjoyable and beautiful because there was a lot of chemistry between these two main characters. Shailene Woodley was terrific, she was born to play this role. It's sad that this director went for the easy way and didn't put lots of important and crucial moments from the book in the film. The DVD version has some extra minutes, but it's just not enough. Overall, The Fault in Our Stars is a mediocre and empty film compared to the book, but it definitely has its moments and the performances were terrific. Sorry if I mentioned the word \"book\" so many times in this review, but I can't stop comparing them. [C+]",

Boy was I wrong. I swear I never expected this one to be the one to make me cry, but here I am, listening to the soundtrack and it is still making me feel something I have not felt in a while. Shailene Woodley continues to convince me in this one that she is the next huge film actress, while this one also served as a great way for Ansel Elgort to introduce himself to me, because his acting is also incredible here. Though about kids with cancer, the tearjerking moments never feel as though they are relying solely on that, because there is just so much more to this film. Truly just beautiful in every way imaginable, The Fault in Our Stars shattered my expectations. The script, written by two of my favorite writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, is great. I cannot compare it to the book, but all the same, the script is perfect. It is amazing how this film can truly make you feel something for every character, as it really does not have any one dimensional characters. They are all multi-faceted in their own way and that is really what helps this one hit me in the way it has. I would also be remiss if I did not mention how good Nat Wolff, Laura Dern, and Willem Dafoe were in their supporting roles. Truly impressive stuff all-around. I love surprises like this.",
