    "critic_reviews": [
        "It's a magical film which manages to transport and rivet us in the same highly-imaginitive, breezily playful way \"Amelie\" did.",
        "Hauntingly tells a story older than the Odyssey and as timely as today's body count from Iraq.",
        "Unfolds amid the mechanized carnage of World War I. Yet everything in it is personal. That's why it's a masterpiece.",
        "This is a movie that considers graphic violence with a refined taste for the sensuous: Guts spill, blood spurts, corpses stink, but there is a handsome, absurdist humanity to the way Jeunet (who wrote the script with Guillaume Laurant) maps out the crossroads of human carnage and human caring.",
        "A unique and masterful film, filled with surprises and felicities and moments of transporting visual power.",
        "Can a movie have too much good stuff? Not when it's stuffed like this one.",
        "Told with a blend of visual mastery and emotional intimacy, ambitious venture sustains a special melding of romance and pragmatism that should engage discerning audiences.",
        "The holiday season's best movie so far.",
        "In its insistence on the centrality of the war to the collective consciousness of mankind, it's of a piece with \"The English Patient,\" rather than \"Saving Private Ryan.\"",
        "The film is near perfect in its attempt to properly mix the irrationality of war in with an interesting love story.",
        "When this long movie is over, all you want to do is clap and weep and watch it all over again immediately.",
        "An emotional powerhouse.",
        "An epic treatment of epic themes that doesn't soft-soap its audience, but at the same time provides a terrifically satisfying entertainment.",
        "A long movie that almost wears out its 21/4-hour welcome, yet it's full of surprises.",
        "Flattens you with concussive detail and the awfulness of war; it plays like \"Saving Private Ryan\" as remade by a Continental mathematician flipping out on Ecstasy.",
        "Jeunet brings everything together -- his joyously poetic style, the lovable Tautou, a good story worth the telling -- into a film that is a series of pleasures stumbling over one another in their haste to delight us.",
        "Jeunet provides numerous pleasures, particularly visual, along the way.",
        "A resolutely odd, occasionally absurd movie, but it's as charming and stylish as one could expect from this pair - if you like that sort of thing.",
        "The downside to all this stylishness: that A Very Long Engagement is Am\u00e9lie Goes to War.",
        "Inventive and lyrical, A Very Long Engagement is a joyous contradiction in terms: a war-torn romantic comedy.",
        "Starts slowly, but builds to a satisfying conclusion.",
        "Longer than necessary, that is, for the story it has to tell. This flaw aside, the drama is well crafted and sometimes touching, with especially forceful opening scenes.",
        "There are many ways to say that war is hell, but few filmmakers have said it with as much imagination, humor, intrigue and humanity as Jean-Pierre Jeunet in A Very Long Engagement.",
        "It's an odd, initially jarring mixture of style and subject matter that works better as the film goes along.",
        "The movie works amazingly well as a historical epic.",
        "Certainly long and not always engaging and comes with a predictably basic ending, yet there are unexpected pleasures, moments of beauty and tiny pockets of joy to sustain you through the journey.",
        "A Very Long Engagement is \"Cold Mountain\" with French people.",
        "The film is a trifle long too long for its rather slim mystery, but in face of so much beauty and invention that's a small quibble.",
        "Mathilde's story is well enough handled by Jeunet to be endurable, and the rest of the film is a reward.",
        "It's just exhausting. For all of the movie's sumptuous, eyepopping craft, you'll feel more than a little relief when Mathilde finally reaches the end of her quest.",
        "Boldly aspirational. It's Jeunet's stab at \"Paths of Glory,\" dipped in a sepia bath and halfway wrenched into a women's picture.",
        "For all of Audrey Tautou's considerable charm in the title role, Jeunet's need for a well-ordered universe proved as suffocating and exhausting as being trapped on an amusement-park ride.",
        "Only when Jodie Foster materializes midstory, delivering a beautiful, pocket-size performance as the mistress of one of the condemned men, does the film spring to life.",
        "Engagement simply disappears inside its own enormous, intricate and ambitious design.",
        "Sacrifices compelling drama for gratuitous whimsy and big-budget spectacle.",
        "Shuttles between schoolboy humor, calculated savagery and, at the end, a rank sentimentalism in which love all too easily conquers all.",
        "The result is nothing but allusive and memorial. And boring. This film is boring, at least partly because it is trying desperately to be big.",
        "The elements are all here for something spectacular \u2013 and in brilliant bursts, Jeunet really gets it \u2013 but in the end, all that potential is sunk by a terminally confused tone and milquetoast pairing of lovers. Pity that."

            "content": "Recently, and as a result of its centenary, films with themes around the First World War have once again been the target of interest. Made in 2004, this movie is far from that kind of cyclical phenomenon where we remember things on theirRecently, and as a result of its centenary, films with themes around the First World War have once again been the target of interest. Made in 2004, this movie is far from that kind of cyclical phenomenon where we remember things on their birthdays, and there's so much good in it that it's hard to know where to start.The script is simply superb and is the envy of many movies with no story to tell: during the Battle of the Somme, five French soldiers are sentenced to death for allegedly having shot themselves in the hands in order to get them out of the fight. The film quickly lets us know that there are, among this group of convicts, some who were victims of accidents with their own weapons, and each has their own life story before the war. One of them is particularly awaited by his fianc\u00e9e... however, after the war, and against all odds, she continues to look for him, convinced that he is alive somewhere, and conducts a real detective work to find him.Jean-Pierre Jeunet's work is excellent. He had already earned an ovation with \"Amelie\", his film of international acclaim, but this film manages to be even better, because it is more complex in all aspects without losing the quality, freshness and rhythm that we feel in \"Amelie\". The film is an absolute must for anyone who wants to see something about the First World War, as it carefully respects the historical rigor and recreates, with good doses of precision, the environment of the trenches: materials, uniforms, weapons, everything seems to be fine with the period and environment. The city of Paris was also lovingly recreated by the director, who gives us the atmosphere of a city, and a society, still digesting everything that happened to it.Audrey Tautou, almost the muse of Jeunet, is once again the star of this film and once again excels in a magnificent dramatic work. She is truly one of the best French actresses today, and brings us a character full of feeling, strength and persistence, who weaves an elegant counterpoint with the apparent fragility of her sick and frail body. In addition to her, the film features the excellent work of Gaspard Ulliel, Dominique Pinon and Marion Cotillard. I would like to highlight the performance of Ticky Holgado, who couldn't be more witty and funny than it is, as well as the honorable cameo of Jodie Foster, a Hollywood veteran whom Jeunet imported, in good time, for a minor role but which she does with dedication, commitment and professionalism, in addition to an impeccable French accent worthy of a native speaker of the tongue. As people say, there are no small roles, n'est ce pas?Despite the excellent story, the remarkable work of the cast, the solicitous direction, the film also has expensive production values and enormous quality, especially considering that it is not a film from Hollywood. The cinematography deserves a very special note, with superb filming work, superb colors with sepia touches and vintage styling, as well as careful editing. The battle scenes were very well done, the sets and costumes are perfect, and the attention to the smallest details is something that does not escape the viewer's eye. Another point I want to highlight is the judicious choice of filming locations, particularly on the coast, where rural bucolicism blends in very well with the wild and untamed nature of the Atlantic. Finally, a note of praise for the excellent soundtrack, composed by Angelo Badalamenti, who we already know from the collaboration in films like \"Blue Velvet\" or \"Mulholland Drive\".",
