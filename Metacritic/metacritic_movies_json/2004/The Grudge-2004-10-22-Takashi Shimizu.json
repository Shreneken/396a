  "critic_reviews": [
    "A master of atmosphere, Japanese director Takashi Shimizu leads his audience along on a celluloid leash to his pitch-black attic of horror, inviting each hair on the back of your neck to stand up.",
    "There is no \"why\" in The Grudge, at least not an explanation that provides comfort or cure. It simply is. That's what makes it really scary.",
    "The only character with any personality in The Grudge is a Tokyo house, but not to worry - it's got enough mean in it to keep any horror movie afloat.",
    "Slightly less frightening than the original, but it's still a scary psycho-horror that effectively replicates its bleak and crisp shocks.",
    "One of the flat-out creepiest films ever released by a major American studio.",
    "It's enough to send you home with jiggly knees and a tummy ache.",
    "This is an eerie, inventively mounted movie: It's a shivery fun time, filled with dark corners, deserted hallways and sudden apparitions. But it never manages to genuinely rattle you.",
    "It's effectively frightening. It's just not the kind of frightening that stays with you very long, unless of course someone decides to make the same movie . . . yet again.",
    "A lean, atmospheric and acutely creepy little horror pic - nothing more, nothing less.",
    "A horror film that consists of virtually nothing but don't-go-in-the-attic suspense scenes strung together with a reasonable degree of brooding mood and a minimum of logic.",
    "In the hands of a less-skilled director, this Hollywood-mandated need to impose order could have ended in disaster.",
    "The overdetermined approach preempts character shadings or social subtext-just compare Hideo Nakata's original \"Ring,\" which tapped its dread from viral-replicant mass culture and its pathos from a broken home, or Nakata's \"Dark Water,\" which channeled the sorrow, guilt, and paranoia felt by a young divorcée mired in a custody battle.",
    "Less a film than a terror delivery system, The Grudge repeatedly shows off Shimizu's technical chops, but never gives viewers a reason to care about or identify with the victims.",
    "American audiences have seen Ju-On. And The Grudge just goes to show why remaking it is such a frivolous idea: What's the use in wasting so much energy if the filmmakers aren't going to fix what was wrong with the movie in the first place?",
    "Less scary than creepy, The Grudge may have lost some oomph in the translation from Japanese to English, and the desire for a PG-13 rating probably muted the violence and perhaps the scares.",
    "The cast is drab and lifeless, the characterization non-existent, the ending simply impossible. Between our jumps of fright come lumps of time that take forever to pass.",
    "It isn't frightening. Sometimes, in fact, it's laughable.",
    "At least the horror premise here has a hook - a house can spread its curse like a plague to adversely affect all who enter.",
    "It’s not a disaster by any stretch, but purists will ache to show newcomers the horrific genius of \"Ju-on\" over The Grudge as soon as they exit the theatre.",
    "The Grudge offers a bit more exposition than did \"Ju-On,\" but the plot is still wispy.",
    "There are so many events here but no real story. Perhaps that is what's making the drowned kabuki ghost so irate: She's desperate to find a coherent script.",
    "Like a good horror movie, the images, jolts and artistically directed disorientation will keep your stomach clenched...Like a bad one, it doesn't make a lick of sense.",
    "Shimizu can't quite pull everything together, trying to get off easy with a bargain-bin twist ending that most of the audience will see coming by the time the pile of corpses reaches double digits.",
    "Takes a leaf from the \"Psycho\" handbook and abandons its star for stretches here and there.",
    "The benchmark for any horror movie, of course, is how well it frightens you, and The Grudge is pretty satisfactory in that regard.",
    "Pretty much a one-trick pony, and, after a while, that trick loses its ability to impress.",
    "Most of the chills have been faithfully re-created, though first-time screenwriter Stephen Susco hasn't done much to straighten out the muddled narrative.",
    "Despite the tighter rewrite and the slicker production, it's obvious that Shimizu is still searching for what scares him, and until he finds it, he doesn't stand--ahem--a ghost of a chance of frightening us.",
    "Isn't art, but as date-night fright flicks go, it's effective.",
    "More than anything, The Grudge suggests that it's time for Shimizu to move on.",
    "Viewers of this Sam Raimi-produced, sub-\"Amityville\" scarefest are likely to hold the real grudge.",
    "Sarah Michelle Gellar, the nominal star, has been in her share of horror movies, and all by herself could have written and directed a better one than this."

There is no explanation to why he is there, nor why he has a black cat with him? Also, if the grudge thing kills people, how did she survive when it appeared under her duvet cover? When Yoko climbs into the loft close to the beginning, and sees the grudge things head, it is just...not scary. I've seen scarier things in children's movies. The jumpy edge to the film is almost non existent, and therefore, there is no horror in the film whatsoever. I do say, the scene in which the grudge thing is following her around the building is mildly scary. Although, how it got out the loft is beyond me. I personally think that, this is a poorly made film. If your'e looking for a real scare, try Blair witch (not the sequel, Blair witch 2 was far worse than the grudge) and Paranormal Activity. 1/10. Why? It managed to get me tense enough to jump when someone opened the front door.",

The one exception is The Ring.\r The Grudge remake, made by the exact same director of the original, is a series of confusing, disconnected creepy scenes until the end where you kinda-sorta get an explanation. No plot. Just typical stupid horror movie characters doing stupid things. \"Oh, let's go check out that really creepy sound all by myself after I found my wife/mother/girlfriend/pet dead/catatonic/(insert-state-of-being-here).\"\r Having seen nearly all the Japanese horror flicks, there is a clear culture of fear of long black hair, water and eyeballs or mouths that are stretched/blacked out via PhotoshopCGI. When you experience it for the first time, it's scary. The second time, it's interesting. For the third, fourth,  it's yaaawwwwwnnnn.",

This is what happened in a certainThis movie is the Western remake of a Japanese horror film based on the idea that a powerful curse appears in a place where someone full of rage dies violently, and that curse can destroy everything around. This is what happened in a certain house in a residential neighborhood of Tokyo, where there are mysterious deaths happening. After a visit, the young American Karen Davis begins to feel haunted and will research the history of the house, in search of a way to ward off the evil that pursues her. Directed by Takashi Shimizu, this film is different from almost everything I've seen in horror: what frightens us is the depth of the permanent tension felt throughout the film. Okay, I've never seen the original so I cannot see how close it is, but it did not fail to impress me. The script is good, the story is interesting and make me remember of \"The Ring\", with all the focus on investigating that dark history. Sarah Michelle Gellar is the protagonist, but she does not make a particularly interesting performance, like none of the actors. Despite this, it's a worth watching horror movie.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nI'd say that the most comparable movie of its type, to this (that I can think of anyway) is The Ring and if I were to compare the two, The Ring is a better movie, in my opinion. This movie is a horror/thriller which very much relies on the constant sinister element to keep you on your toes, to keep you watching. There's heavy use of violins to create the suspense, the buildings seem quite sort of  'clinical', there's alot of greys, alot of dark shots where your left trying to follow the line of sight of the characters on screen, searching for clues as to where the sinister noise is coming from, although it isn't just the strange noises that peak the interest but you can tell the characters on screen feel compelled somehow to follow some intangible aura...creepy, huh? ehh..I do tend to be sceptical of these sorts of movies but having seen a few, I really don't think this is among the best. I kept watching the movie yet I kept feeling that I simply 'wasn't buying it', which is for a variety of reasons, which I'll explain now.I'd say that the first reason for this is that the story, as it unravelled, became confusing to me - I say this in as much as the scenes kept cutting between different time frames and I found it hard to keep track of the timeline. I thought the characters and the roles they played were also a bit unclear at times, although that may be more down to me not keep proper track.I also didn't find it very believable (surprise, surprise(!)) in terms of Karens ability to escape the situations she found herself in. I do like a good thriller that grabs you and you feel compelled to follow it through to see the final outcome for the main character, the good guy/gal but I only bedgrudginly watched it through to the end as it reached a point where it felt quite predictable and I could have guessed the ending.Another issue for me was when the 'curse', this sinister element was shown visually on screen - maybe I'm a bit harsh as a critic but I have to say, I found it more comical than genuinely scary. It may have been better if they hadn't included the ocassional scene showing the 'deathly' or 'otherwordly' figure, it kind of spoiled it for me a bit - in movies such as The Blair Witch Project, it works due to the fact that its up to us, the viewer, to have an image in our minds of what this unspeakable horror is but we get a few too many glimpses in this movie and I simply didn't feel that it worked well.What I think did work pretty well were some of the shocked faces, the stoney, lifeless expressions that appeared throughout. Unfortunately, overall I feel there's little credibility to make up for it really - it has quite an American feel to it and knowing it was based on a Japanese/Asian original, this is another of those movies where you hear that the original is much better than whats seen by some as a lazy remake making use of a popular cast to basically partially guarantee revenue - I imagine the original is alot scarier, with a higher age rating to reflect that. I'd say that this movie doesn't scare me but thats not to say that it couldn't instill fear in other people, it does have a bit of a sinister feel to it and some scenes would certainly scare if not disturb younger viewers, so I would definitely not encourage children to watch it, but if this type of movie is your 'kinda thing', I'd say there are better examples out there.It seems only fair to mention, after the criticism I've given towards the film, that I didn't feel compelled to switch it off, there was something about it which was rather eery and peaked my interest somewhat, although I didn't by any means feel like I was right at the edge of my seat, I did follow it through to the end and as such I feel it would be perhaps a bit harsh to give it a 1 star rating. I'm also aware that movies like this with this sort of story aren't entirely my cup of tea (I do wonder why I keep watching them I suppose but even so, I recognise what I believe to be better made examples of this type of movie) but others can get more 'into them' and as such, I'm going to slightly give it the benefit of the doubt and issue it with a 2 star rating but given I've seen similar movies which I felt more 'involved with' and I felt had a more original plot, I just can't say that this is worth considering above them, so I have to give it a low rating.",
