    "summary": "Set in the fast-paced world of motorcycle racing, this action movie shows what happens to biker Cary Ford (Henderson) when he is framed by a long-time rival (Schulze).",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "A terrific action picture, fast-moving, studded with great stunts and smart enough not to take itself too seriously. Amid a plethora of high-minded, big-deal, year-end Oscar contenders, it offers a welcome contrast (and respite).",
        "The movie is a guzzle of yahoo-Mountain Dew empty-calorie satisfaction: A quick blood-sugar high, an eyeful of bikes and bosoms, and you're out of the theater in 80 minutes. And on a bleak winter's day, that can be meal enough.",
        "The movie is as adolescent as it sounds, but Kahn keeps your eyes popping with truly nonstop action and some of the most outlandishly inventive effects you've ever seen. And of course Cube is so supercool it's worth the price of admission just to watch him.",
        "Zippy, stylish fun.",
        "The movie is simple fun.",
        "The first three minutes convince us we're are looking at a commercial before the feature begins. Then we realize the whole movie will look like this.",
        "A good stupid movie: an energetic send-up of a discredited genre that does for motorcycle movies, say, what Jonathan Demme's debut, the 1974 drive-in classic, \"Caged Heat,\" did for chicks-in-prison flicks.",
        "Invites you not simply to identify with its low IQ but to cheer it on. This is a movie that knows you know it's dumb, and that's enough to make the whole thing worth tolerating.",
        "A spectacularly trashy and aggressively flashy motorcycle melodrama in which computer-enhanced action scenes, unbound by gravity or logic, are choreographed, photographed and edited to resemble video-game stratagems.",
        "The plot, characters, story and dialogue were all secondary -\u2013 or lower. With this in mind, Torque really wasn't that bad. In fact, with this in mind, Torque was actually pretty good.",
        "The film occasionally pokes fun at itself, although not nearly as often as it should. I don't recommend it for anything more significant than a bottom-of-the-barrel rental or a desperation cable choice, but it delivers what it advertises, and I suppose that could be considered a virtue.",
        "The cycle thrills here are everything: flips, collisions, a chase across the top of a fast-moving train and even a zoom down the aisle of one of the train's cars as the passengers take it in stride.",
        "Purely an easy-to-digest testosterone flick anyway, with standard bikini babes, roaring engines and bikers who circle each other slowly in the dust before they rumble.",
        "Despite all the bike chases and bullet-dodging, the real sport here is Xtreme posing.",
        "Thankfully, Torque knows what it wants to be (which is more than you can say about other recent biker-boy flicks) and flashes a jocular self-awareness about its genre affiliation.",
        "Although the press notes liken the movie to \"Easy Rider\" (why not \"Lawrence of Arabia\" while you're at it?), the obvious comparison is to the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise, which shares the same producer. Actually, the closest spiritual cousin may be \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure.\"",
        "Torque knows it\u2019s one big joke, dusty chaps, heaving bosoms, and all, which makes it all that much easier to swallow. And forget.",
        "It may entertain you if you don't mind senseless stories and screaming soundtracks.",
        "It's a simple-minded celebration of speed that pretends to be nothing else, even throwing in the occasional wink to acknowledge its own silliness.",
        "Torque isn't a movie, it's an 81-minute soda commercial.",
        "With the exception of a few dazzling special effects and a digitally enhanced camera move or two... it's also a towering bore.",
        "With the exception of a decent train-top chase, Torque is all vroom and no action.",
        "Delivers state-of-the-art freeway thrills tenuously held together by an absurd plot, cheap but pretty leads (Martin Henderson, Monet Mazur), diner and gas station locations that look like they've been preserved in amber since the 1950s, and plenty of engine porn.",
        "For a movie that's supposed to be about speed and movement, Torque is a peculiarly slow kind of torture. Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition -- especially not in an action movie.",
        "By Monday, Torque will look like a period piece with its expiration date, January 2004, prominently displayed. The inevitable movie-inspired video game will appear more realistic.",
        "The loudest, trashiest, stupidest, cheesiest celebration of ritualized male aggression of 2004.",
        "It's only January, but already we have a strong candidate for the most thunderingly stupid movie of the year.",
        "The final irony is that it's tailored for a PG-13 audience: The violence is bloodless, the sex is all come-on and the surreally reckless stunts cater to viewers too young to drive.",
        "Torque has a sense of humor about itself, but the laughs stick in the throat."

It's the Fast  the Furious on motorcycles! Torque is a ridiculous film from the producers of the Fast  the Furious, and it's basically the same movie except for a few key points. First they didn't have the budget of the Fast  the Furious which is evident by the stunts, which at times actually looked like a video game. I'm all for stunt men doing impossible things, and I don't mind good computer generated action either, however the CGI in Torque is just ridiculously bad, it is however nowhere near as bad as the acting. Instead of Vin Diesel and the dashing Paul Walker, the producers of this film settled for Ice Cube and some guy no one has ever heard of and trust me, the inexperience shows. This film is just as bad as all the other reviews say it is. Some poorly written, badly acted films, can be entertaining...Torque is not!",

There is no sense in the action, which lacks plausibility, entertainment and realism - 0 for 3 is pretty bad in an action flick.
