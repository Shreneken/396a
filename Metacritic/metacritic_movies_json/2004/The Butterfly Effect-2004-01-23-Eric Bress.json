    "critic_reviews": [
        "The ending is weak, and may be the result of the filmmakers writing themselves into a corner and not wanting to conclude things in a burst of nihilistic excess. Yet, even though it's a cheat, it retains a degree of resonance.",
        "Kutcher delivers a credibly serious performance as Evan, and he's surrounded by a skilled supporting cast.",
        "There's so much flashing forward and backward, so many spins of fate, so many chapters in the journals, that after awhile I felt that I, as well as time, was being jerked around.",
        "A terrific story, years in the making, that clearly stays true to the uncompromising vision of its creators. The results are on the screen.",
        "As a thriller, The Butterfly Effect is iffy and uneven, but as a portrait of a people, it's effective and intriguing.",
        "Isn't a complete waste of time. If Kutcher seeks to transition from national joke to lightweight actor, he's made a decent stab at it.",
        "An entertaining piece of supernatural nonsense whose sheer audacity disarms all (well, nearly all) skepticism.",
        "The film works best as an extended \"Twilight Zone\" episode.",
        "Kutcher's performance isn't terrible, but the brilliant, bewildered, increasingly desperate Evan is the film's center, and grounding its flights of fantasy in rock-solid emotional reality is more than Kutcher can manage.",
        "In its own ridiculous way, The Butterfly Effect is an entertaining movie, despite mediocre acting, lackluster direction and a story that's sometimes frustrating. It has the integrity of camp, maintaining an odd earnestness in the face of its own absurdity.",
        "Somewhere, back in the mists of time, co-writers Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber must have flapped their gums in the fond hope of crafting a script; today, that whisper of hot air has swollen into a feature flick that rains down upon us a veritable torrent of inane plot.",
        "Better than you might expect despite its awkward, slow beginning, drawing you in gradually and paying off in surprisingly effective and bittersweet ways.",
        "Unpleasantness alone doesn't sink a movie. But miserable tidings intensify when there's not only a high ick factor but also floundering storytelling.",
        "With a surprisingly unhappy, anti-Hollywood ending that will appeal to those who like things dark.",
        "Ashton Kutcher wants to be taken seriously so badly it hurts. So does this metaphysical mess of a movie, a pseudo time-travel drama so complicated it takes more than half an hour just to establish the gimmick. And a gimmick it is.",
        "Kutcher is the wrong actor to anchor a psychological freak-out.",
        "Arguably worse than its sadistic absurdity is the depressing, limited scope.",
        "Profoundly knuckleheaded.",
        "So consistently silly and overwrought that it flirts with the elusive so-bad-it's-entertaining category.",
        "So, here's the problem with The Butterfly Effect: It's silly.",
        "This overwrought and egregiously self-serious thriller about the poisonous fruit borne of child abuse grows more ridiculous by the quarter-hour and is poised for a theatrical life span scarcely longer than that of its eponymous insect.",
        "You have to, if not love, at least not mind a movie in which the very act of Ashton Kutcher reading is enough of a cosmic trauma to rip a hole in the fabric of space-time.",
        "My advice? Grab Mr. Peabody\u2019s Wayback Machine and recast with Jimmy Dean.",
        "Impressively sets a new standard for time travel gone awry.",
        "Abysmal thriller.",
        "If you approach this movie in the right frame of mind -- that is, with total contempt -- you can still enjoy it as a comedy.",
        "As soon as I finish writing this review, I'm going to try traveling a few hours in the past. That way, I can improve my life by skipping this movie!",
        "A film of singularly boneheaded conceits, Butterfly is populated by, and appears to have been made by, stoned college dudes more hung up on oh-wow twists than the need to make sense.",
        "Nothing can save this repetitive bore. Dude, where's your memory?",
        "A bad-movie-lover's heaven, and a good-movie-lover's hell.",
        "An undercooked allusion to chaos theory -- gives every appearance of having been conceived, planned and executed out of a high school locker room.",
        "As the requisite love interest, Amy Smart gives the film's only professional performance, while co-star Eric Stoltz, as the story's villain, walks somnolent through the scenery with what seems to be barely suppressed mirth. Given the deeply unpleasant plot machinations and amateurish direction, the actor's amusement is understandable.",
        "It's like receiving a box of Valentine's chocolates in which someone has deliberately hidden ground glass. Flee.",
        "Inhabited by a genuine spirit of cruelty, both toward its characters and its audience."

Ashton Kutchner was great, we see him in a whole different light, you see a side of him you haven't before. Evan spends his whole life trying to make things right for everyone else around him. He loses and gains and hurts for those around him. He is so busy trying to make things right for everyone else and he never thinks soley on himself. He loves Callie and wants more than anything to be with her, but he wants her to be safe and never go through all she went through in her other lives. He gives up the love he holds so dear to protect her. He's absolutely precious in this movie. He seems very real in the movie and thats one thing that makes it so touching. He does an outstanding job and i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. By the end you are wanting so much for him to find some kind of peace. Some kind of happiness. All the characters were greatly done, you could relate or dislike many and even sympathize with them as well. It was a great cast and a great movie!",

But the movie manages to draw you in anyway. This was one hell of a movie. I thought the ending was well done, and even a little sad. The beginning was excellently done, the middle...although the whole wheelchair scenario easily could have been cut with no consequence to the story, the rest of the movie flows perfectly.

At first, it was okay. It was pretty average, but not too unremarkable. Then it kept switching between different scenes and I started getting a bit confused. \u201cDid the movie mean for it to seem random and sudden, or is it really just that bad?\u201d After the meeting with Evan\u2019s father and the scene where Tommy loses it at the cinema, I was laughing at how ridiculous and exaggerated the events were and how they just rushed those events by without ever stopping to think about how that\u2019d affect anything. The interesting parts start when Evan reads journal entries he wrote when he was younger, and discovers that by reading them, he can travel back in time to when these blackouts occurred. That was fine, though it could have been better. The writing could have been more imaginative. Why is it that every time Evan saves Lenny, Lenny ends up as his roomate? Why is it that every time Evan saves Kayleigh, she ends up with him? Why is it that every time Evan saves Tommy, he ends up a nice religious guy? How could Evan\u2019s empty threats stop Kayleigh and Tommy\u2019s father from being a pedophile and abuser? Why didn\u2019t Evan get charged with self defense in the first place? The movie tries to make their characters seem real and deep or whatever, but the script changes too fast and provides way too much mood whiplash that it ends up being confusing and frustrating. This contradictory writing is a great source of unintentional hilarity.The ending of the movie is something I can appreciate. It was probably the most well-written part in the entire movie, and certainly the only part I can\u2019t find any glaring or aggravating problems about.All in all, the most I\u2019d give this movie a 6/10. The hilarious way it goes about trying to be dramatic and meaningful keeps the movie from being unremarkable, but it\u2019s still not simething I\u2019d watch again nor recommend to others.",

What if there's an alternate life for you somewhere, out there, where the cumulative sum of your choices leads to a better reality, a happier and more fulfilling existence? On the flip-side - what if, at the end of the day, you really can't achieve a solid grip on these things, no matter how hard you try?A great deal of science fiction works of art have tried to approach these meaningful questions throughout the years, all presenting many philosophical ideas and notions as to how one man can change his own fate, for better or for worse. In this surprisingly good sci-fi adventure from 2004, directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber (who are also behind the screenplay of Final Destination 2) raise all these questions once again, but use a different angle this time around. Time travel is not the issue here. Instead, our lead protagonist, Evan Treborn (portrayed by Hollywood prankster Ashton Kutcher \u0096 but more on that later) leads his whole life up until his early 20's without knowing he has a rare medical condition that seemingly helps him shut away traumatic incidents that occurred throughout his childhood and adolescence years. All he remembers from these various occasions are bizarre blackouts. But when a blast from his past comes back into his life only to leave it ever so tragically (Kayleigh Miller, portrayed by the lovely Amy Smart who we've since seen in films such as Just Friends and Crank), Evan learns that he can return to those important lost moments in his life and re-inhabit his younger body, thus changing the present and future. However, with every shift in the past comes an alternate present that may seem better at first, but is in fact a far harsher reality than the original one Evan has left.What truly touched me about this film was the essence in which it captured the troublesome youth of my generation, that was born in the 1980's, grew up in the 1990's, and is ever since trying to adapt to the ever changing reality in which we all live in. Here, one man tries to alter all this, and his own personal journey is parallel in many ways to the journey many young people go through nowadays. Part of capturing this Generation X notion is the pop-culture presented throughout the film. When you see the young actors and actress fall in love, fight, and grow up real fast, it all happens amidst references to films of the period (Se7en, etc.), outfits, 1980's technology and other devices that fill you up with an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia and sentiment, as if you were there yourself, living these events and going through all these horrible/wonderful events.Above all things, the makers of The Butterfly Effect do the unbelievable and turn Ashton Kutcher into a good actor \u0096 a feat I thought was unachievable at best. However, in this sci-fi epic it appears as though anything is possible. Bottom line, it was a fresh breath of air when I saw it, left me pondering for days, and gave me the inspiration and write something myself after a long period of writers block. If a film manages to be this inspirational and keep you on the edge of your seat throughout its 113 minutes.",

If you watch the theater's cut, it is just awful. What a terrible ending. This film basically has 2 different reviews, 1/10 for the theater cut, and 10/10 for director's cut.

It's not incompetent film-making mind you. If anything the film is simply too effective. Literally showing the world's worst childhood. It is so much of a downer with child molestation, baby killing and burning puppies that it's almost a Stephen King parody. I guess there is a reason we repress memories after all. I would repress that childhood as well.\r The film to that point kind of reminded me of Sleepers where it was so unpleasant it didn't matter how good the movie is. It's certainly nothing I would ever want to see again. Then the movie takes a wild turn as Ashton Kutcher shows up. As easy a target as he is I hate to admit the second two-thirds of the film are really not his fault.\r Some notes to writer/directors Eric Briss and J. Mackye Gruber. If your going to have scenes in a prison you might want to visit one first, or at least watch a documentary on the same. Speaking of documentaries \"Revenge of the Nerds\" and other eighties comedies are not a documentaries on college life. Sororities do not resemble the Playboy Mansion. And twenty-three year old crack whores often look bad but they tend not to resemble a Dawn of the Dead extra.\r If The Butterfly Effect didn't keep flashing back to the puppy and baby horrors, then the second two thirds would be a hoot. There is even a \"hey there is a psycho chasing me lets take a walk in the dark woods\" scene.\r Since Kutcher's time travel effects only his friends and family and nothing else at all. The Butterfly Effect inadvertently substantiates the reverse of the Butterfly theorem.\r Needless to say the change in tone from the childhood scenes and adult scenes is jarring. Though most of the humor in the adult scenes is admittedly unintentional. Kutcher travels back in time by staring at notebook paper. I tried the same technique staring at my screen. It didn't work I still lost two hours.",

Performances by the stars are good enough and the emotionally engaging story arc makes up for any acting shortcomings.

I've been intrigued by this movie for a few years now but I never got to see it until yesterday. But lets ponder the premise of this film for a second, what if you could go back to major junctions in your life and go down another path? What if there's an alternate existence out there for you? where the cumulative sum of the choices that you didn't make become a better reality with a happier and more fulfilling existence? But at the same time what if the power to change the past and it ended up screwing up your reality for the better? what if the choice you didn't make wasn't the good choice? Do you go back and see the consequences? The story is fairly uncomplicated, presenting events in a chronological order that keeps the viewer's attention and interested. With films like this, there are invariably going to be a ton of plot holes if you think too much about it, but that's part of the charm. The plot features a guy who damaged by the events of his past, then he discovers that he can travel back in time to various times of his life, and the ensuing chaos that arises when he tries to change things in the hopes of making things better for those involved. His sole motivation, from my perspective was to find a way to where he can be with his girl while at the same time changing the events and lives of those he was friends with at the time. The whole point of the movie focuses on the butterfly effect and how little choices send echoes through time and change the events of your life for better or for worse. The whole premise of the film is so well thought out that I'm just baffled on why this film has a paltry 30 on metacritc. Ashton Kutcher, whom I've never been a fan of and have almost despised every movie he's been in, gives a surprising performance that really shows his acting chops. Most of the cast did well also and deserve props for their work in this film. However, in this sci-fi epic it appears as though anything is possible and it left me pondering my own decisions in life with the big \"what if we could go back and do this instead of this?\" question. While I understand that people/critcs may not like it or even understand its premise you have to give it props, in my point of view as film manages to be inspirational and can maybe help you get over your past while at the same time doing a good job at keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout its entirety.",

I had read very little about him, but I knew I would address the subject of time travel. It's a tricky subject, which requires some contextualization and script effort to make it credible on screen, and that's been covered a lot in action movies or sci-fi giving rise to arguably quality movies most of the time. So I didn't expect anything particularly bright. However, the film has shown courage in the way it addresses the theme.In fact, the roadmap focuses on the issue of time travel, which is not really physical but mental travel. The main character, Evan, has a gift (or curse?) Whereby she can mentally return to her own past and modify it. However, the past can never be changed without radical implications for future events. So with each trip, Evan's life changes dramatically as, on the other hand, his mental health deteriorates. Complicated and debated issues among scientists, such as paradoxes or \"alter egos\" are addressed in a simple, easy to understand, and above all, credible way.The cast is not the strong point of the movie. Ashton Kutcher did what he had to do as a protagonist, but he had the advantage of good material and a character that captivates our sympathy from the start. Logan Lerman, who gave life to the same character as Kutcher, but in his childhood also seemed very good to me, and has everything to be an excellent actor in the future. Amy Smart and Elden Henson (in some scenes with a very hard-rock costume) also appear in the cast, but only provide some support to the protagonist.The special, visual and sound effects are regular and the soundtrack is pretty bad, not to mention nonexistent. But this is easily understood: it is a film with a limited budget, but a good story, so let the story be the focus of public attention, minimizing the effects and trying not to disturb the flow of the story told. The result is an engaging movie that doesn't creep into unnecessary scenes most of the time.",

However the execution of the idea is not the best, I think. The film obviously tries to be realistic showing all the coincidences that can alter our lives and turn it from better to worse, while the  protagonist's supernatural power is only a tool. Until a certain point it could even have been an option that he is indeed mentally ill and none of the impossible stuff has ever happened. But of course that's not what happens in the movie.\rA good science fiction concept is although actually unbelievable, you forget about that fact while watching the film because it is made to seem very realistic and logical in the setting of the story. But this story utterly failed to be realistic, in my opinion they exaggerated Evan's bad childhood in such a level that it failed to be believable, it was a very clich\u00e9d  freudian excuse and it's not just Evan but the rest of the characters as well. I couldn't even really care about him because even though they tried to portray him like this nice, good kid, at the same time he is blowing up people's mailboxes with his friends. My point is, the film failed to present it's message, because I could not believe that their future turned out bad every single time because of the butterfly-effect and unpredictability despite them trying hard, instead I think it turned out the way it did because they were looser who didn't try hard enough.  Evan had plenty of opportunities, truly. First of all, he killed a guy, like what was he thinking? Certainly not \"Maybe I should stop hitting the brother of my girlfriend, he is passed out and covered in blood.He might die.She might hate me for it. I might rot in jail for the rest of my life.\" Yeah, that's definitely not what he was thinking.. Also why did he stop right next to the mailbox, he shouldn't have to loose his arms if he had been more clever, he knew it was about to blow. Also I just can't believe that someone is so self-sacrificing that he is trying to fix the lives of everyone but when he is sitting in a wheel-chair without arms, he wouldn't fix his own life, not until he sees his mother's condition. The girl was very stupid from the start , she suffered all that abuse because she liked a boy, that's ridiculous. Her brother was such a stereotypically bad kid that it's impossible to blame his behaviour just on his abuse, more like he was plain evil. Whatever, my point is if someone more apt had possessed Evan's \"gift\", he/she might actually have been able to make things right. Of course this film has multiple endings, so in the theatrical version Evan can make things right, too.  However in the director's cut he just sacrifices himself, like his mother's previous babies did, kind of dumb, he has no reason to do that since he can fix everything just the way he did in the theatrical version. Still, all in all, this is not a bad film, as a whole I quite liked it, but I had to point out the things I disliked. Also it's a quite overrated film.",

I'll admit that the beginning draws you in, but the minute we get Ashton on the screen, the whole thing takes a steep dive and doesn't stop until it crashes nose first into the finale. I suppose it's the fact that this movie so thoroughly squanders its potential that makes me hold it in what would otherwise be considerably less contempt. Don't misunderstand though, the issue isn't that this movie is bleak, but if one intends to make a serious film with fatalistic tendencies, that filmakers should realize they WILL be set to a higher standard, and that standard is one this movie falls very short of. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one unless you think that because something is \"dark\" than that automatically makes it \"deep\" as well (or if you're a brooding teenager).",

It does add a supernatural element to its otherwise extremely natural world and exploits it beatifully to navigate viewers through many dramatic and often horrifying possiblities.Fair warnings:If you are just looking for a brainless, meaningless bunch of pictures flashing on the screen I'd recommend passing on this movie and going for a typical minimal effort Comedy, Drama, Action or Horror movie.

For Ashton, it was one of his better performances. For Amy, it was decent. People mistake the concept of the film with time travel. Yeah, I think it is part of it, but the film clearly states in the intro that it is about CHAOS theory. I think the Director's Cut's ending was much superiror than the theatical ending. I blame the studios. Yeah, life changing alteration can be fun to watch, but some of the things were overly done. The film tried too hard to make everything change for each alteration. Although it was funny, Frat-life alteration was overly done. It seems like they foreced it to happen. But I love the depth of psychological aspects of the film. The fact that blackouts in the film only happened in the events of \"future\" reconstruction. It was left blank in the brain to fill it in later. Could you imagine multiple neural reconstruction of your brain for new memories? No one knows how will it be or how it could be, but this film did a pretty good job. Ashton having the skull cracking pain for his reconstruction seems very reasonable. What will happen to your brain upon a complete input of all new memories with original memories residing in the brain? The beauty of memories will be gone and only co-exist as psuedo-reality. I personally think a person will go insane with co-exiting of memories from exact time and location; thus this explains why everyone in Evan's family line appears insane. Just think about how crazy the director's cut's ending is. This film is deep, but sugar coated with Hollywood's studio power, I'm just disappointed how so many critics didn't see the depth of deeper meanings this film was trying to reach. Yeah, it was little cliche here and there playing under typical Hollywood, but there is something other than the typical.",

Just look at the reviews for this movie, found on this site. And the biggest complaint you see is the plot is silly. That the plot is nonsense. The truth is, the plot isn't grounded in what they accept as reality. And that prevents them from seeing the commentary behind it. The basic concept is. We have a group of friends that grow up, with a pretty f-ked up childhood. Evan, the main character begins to suffer from blackouts. He is taken to a child psychologist, who assures Evans mother its nothing to worry about. And that children usually do this to forget about stressful and traumatic experiences. He reccomends that Evan begin to reccord a journal to help him remember. When Evan grows up, and is in college. He realizes he can take control of his past self by reading his journal. Basically his consciousness can take a trip back in time. Allowing him to change his past. This turns out to be a silly and unrealistic but suprizingly effective plot device. It allows the story telling to reveals things about the characters twisted past, in very interesting ways. It allows the movie to talk about consequences and humanity in very intriguing ways. The movie is overall well executed. Effective camera angles. Great use of sound and image filters during the film. There is some less then satisfactory acting. But I never found it to be laughably or unacceptably bad. I think the degree of which this movie was panned highlights a problem with critics. One reviewer basically critized the film for not having a typical hollywood ending. Another reviewer critized it for being \"complicated\". This movie has a lot of good ideas, and if you approach it open mindedly, you will find an intriguing commentary wraped in twisted imagery, backed by great film making and editing. Don't get me wrong, this movie is not perfect, nor close to it. But I think it would be a shame if the genius in this movie is forgotten. Because the movies plot refuses to be grounded by preconcieved notions, and because of a few minor fumbles by a few actors. Seriously, don't take critics of any kind seriously on anything any more.

The displaced ventricles in the middle of the brain are sometimes referred to as looking like a butterfly. In the movie, Evan is not schizophrenic, but in the next to last universe he \"jumps\" to (after he accidentally kills Kayleigh as a child), he is treated as if he is; the doctors tell him that everything that happened to him throughout the course of the movie was made-up.",

In this film, Ashton Kutcher's/Logan Lerman's character finds a way to enter these dimensions and make the opposite choice. This movie was so good, because the possibilities are endless.

I can tell you that films in our times can give you only a leftist trash in your brains, really, but this film have bad ideas as well. Yeah, this film can give you some thoughts about your life, society, relationships and etc, but has anyone noticed a big package of propaganda about guys in this film? I noticed. Listen to me, why all guys figured in the film are fully **** Lenny is a j**king motherf**ker, Tommy is a ruthless psycho, Evan is a full idiot too. Only girls are good here. Absolutely, that's more better than marvel's or dc's stupidity, but some scenes and themes are really useless",
