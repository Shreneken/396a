  "critic_reviews": [
    "A hugely entertaining thriller shot through with dark shards of agony and paranoia. It takes nothing away from the original while delivering pleasures all its own.",
    "The strength of sensational material joined to excellent acting, superior filmmaking and uncanny political relevance has made The Manchurian Candidate into exceptionally intelligent entertainment and a high point of director Jonathan Demme's career.",
    "Neither the social commentary nor the story ever overpower the other, a feat that allows this remake to stand proudly alongside the original, its equal in every way.",
    "Demme here shows off both the mastery of suspense that made \"The Silence of the Lambs\" a classic, and the humane understanding and appreciation of character that not just deepens but energizes this film.",
    "Structurally and thematically similar to John Frankenheimer's original but entirely different in style, feel and nuance, this political thriller about a brainwashed soldier being positioned for the White House provides a delectable network of dramatic tripwires that teases the mind and quickens the pulse. This is brainy popcorn fare.",
    "Shockingly, he's (Jonathan Demme) pulled it off, replicating the original's tricky feat of investing a paranoid plot with timeliness, psychological complexity, sociopolitical acumen, and almost frightening conviction.",
    "A political thriller that manages to be at once silly and clever, buoyantly satirical and sneakily disturbing, but he (Demme) has recovered some of the lightness and sureness of touch that had faded from his movies after \"The Silence of the Lambs.\"",
    "A stylish hoot: entertainingly edgy and ludicrous all at once.",
    "We've come to expect each new Demme film to percolate to an urgently musical beat. (The Manchurian Candidate also features a few cameos by musicians as diverse as Robyn Hitchcock and Fab Five Freddy.)",
    "The performance of the movie is Liev Schreiber as Shaw, a man howlingly uncomfortable in his own skin.",
    "The updated classic is a chiller of a political thriller in its own right.",
    "If Demme's version lacks the wallop of its predecessor, it is more likely to be popular with contemporary audiences, who will enjoy not only its labyrinthine twists but its stars' burnished professionalism.",
    "What is surprising is how fresh Demme’s version is and how close it approaches the original in terms of quality.",
    "Demme, who works a clever permutation on the original ending, is more than capable of doing the thriller thing--even with material that will strike a good percentage of his audience as familiar. As an intelligent genre flick, the movie plays to his strengths. His direction of actors has never been better.",
    "His performance here made me suspect that Schreiber is, in a sense, another Kenneth Branagh--an extraordinary actor who is simply not a film star.",
    "A cracking conspiracy thriller that's well-cast, slyly satirical and -- as a solid, glossy, contemporised remix of a classic -- rings enough creepy changes to surprise.",
    "Demme's movie is just as sophisticated and knowing as Frankenheimer's, but it isn't as hip or daring. It doesn't haunt your mind or stir your sense of dread the way the '62 movie did--and it lacks almost totally the earlier film's piercing, oddball satire and humor.",
    "If you ride the paranoiac tide, letting Jonathan Demme's assured direction carry you along, the sardonic humor and anxiety-inducing message work on you.",
    "Filled with conspiracies, intrigue and the suggestion that modern-day society is purposely designed to drive us a little nuts, The Manchurian Candidate is a paranoid fantasy for our time.",
    "Sure, there are holes in The Manchurian Candidate, and tenuous coincidences and too-convenient plot devices. But Washington, Schreiber, Streep and company - and Demme - have managed to make all the malevolent machinations seem relevant again.",
    "This riveting film is marred by compromises -- such as a switch of assassins to create an unpersuasive upbeat ending -- that keep it in the shadow of its predecessor.",
    "Denzel Washington is stellar, and so is Tak Fujimoto's cinematography, which is as edgy and antsy as the story it tells.",
    "Washington is wisely cast as Marco; few actors command more instant respect, and the movie uses that to make his character both believable and sympathetic.",
    "The first \"Candidate\" was inspired pop art, a two-dimensional coloring book about 1962 America's subterranean political fears. Demme's film is more nuanced, less crazy-brilliant and, yes, probably less necessary, but it's still a confirmation of all the anxieties out there on the table and festering in our heads.",
    "Streep wisely goes for oblique humor rather than straight-ahead villainy, making the character different and yet just as loathsome.",
    "Part patrician WASP, part Lady Macbeth and revealing more than a little of Hilary Clinton steel, Streep crackles with neurotic energy and barely checked sexuality, sublimated into an addiction to power and an unhealthy devotion to her son.",
    "[Streep] isa pleasure to watch -- and to marvel at -- every second she's onscreen.",
    "Just as you feel the numbing, clammy clench of paranoia on your neck, you realize, nope, the grip is just the director's attempt at tickling you to death. Demme's movie had no right to work. It does, and then some.",
    "Beautifully made and unsurpassingly creepy, it's the rare remake with something contemporary to add.",
    "In a story driven by questions of loyalty and allegiance, no candidate is identified by party. It's a bipartisan nightmare from which no one escapes unscathed.",
    "What this Manchurian Candidate for a new generation makes up for in timing, it lacks in discipline and edge.",
    "Very surprisingly, Meryl Streep is not wonderful as Schreiber's scheming, incestuously possessive mother. She gobbles up all the scenery but, for whatever reason, she's just not half as chilling a portrait of demented mother love as the original's Angela Lansbury.",
    "The result, regardless of how it was arrived at, is gutless.",
    "A case of smart and talented people trying to jam a Cold War square into a Gulf War circle. You can feel the chafing, to say nothing of the burden this capably crafted shrug has taken on.",
    "Uniformly excellent performances keep this destabilizing tale ticking, yet one can't help wishing Hollywood had combined this cast and these timely themes with a little bit of imagination to come up with something fresh.",
    "The movie is overwrought and unfocussed.",
    "Demme’s Manchurian Candidate is far from a disgrace, but it's not freewheeling enough, not strange enough to make sense of our gathering dread.",
    "If you don't care about the first version, or what director Jonathan Demme's name once meant, the cast does an OK job with Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris's routine thriller script.",
    "Toothless, gutless, one-note political movies like Jonathan Demme's The Manchurian Candidate, a picture that purports to have a galvanizing, liberal-minded theme (big business is taking over our country and our lives) but is really just ploddingly pedestrian.",
    "It all adds up to something less powerful and interesting than the original."

To be honest, the story just didn't interest me that much, but it started streaming this month, so I gave it a shot. As expected, it's a someone complex story, that at times was difficult to understand, however an all-star cast manages to pull it together at the end. The story begins in Iraq during the Gulf War, when a U.S. Army platoon goes missing for three days. Even they were unaware of what happened to them, until one of the men starts having nightmares, and bodies start turning up. Denzel Washington plays the commanding officer, who takes it upon himself to investigate the strange deaths of his men, almost a decade later. As always, Washington is at the top of his game, giving off that infectious intensity, that keeps you on the edge of your seat through every step of the investigation. Washington is paired with Liev Schreiber who is one guy that has always just rubbed me the wrong way. It's not that he's a bad actor, there is just something about him and the characters he plays that is inherently unlikeable. He wasn't bad in this film, but being a similarly intense actor, meant that the chemistry with Washington was almost non-existent. The story is complicated and in the beginning of the film, it's going to be somewhat hard to watch. As the film proceeds and the elements become more clear, the film gets easier to watch, and the ending really pulls everything together. The Manchurian Candidate is one of those films that you think is going to be a bust, some people may even turn it off, but those who stick with it will see that it just gets better and better until a surprise ending brings it all together. If I were the writer of this film, I would have made the beginning of the film more intense and less confusing. The truth is the most important parts of a film are the beginning and the end, and without a strong opening, a lot of people will be turned off to the film and have the wrong attitude throughout. If you manage to stick with it, The Manchurian Candidate is great, but it does take a while to get there.",

Though this remake is flawed, it has more than its fair share of positives. From its compelling premise that really hooks you in from the very beginning to the absolutely stunningly good performance from Meryl Streep, The Manchurian Candidate has some real high notes. Liev Schrieber also turns in a reliably good performance in this film from director Jonathan Demme that keeps you on your toes and thrills continuously from beginning to end. That said, it does have a few problems. With its compelling premise, things at the end should have would wound up being far messier. Unfortunately, its too neat ending left me more than disappointed. Additionally, the editing can be a bit spotty with some really weird transitions and scenes seemingly lacking flow here and there. That said, The Manchurian Candidate is a solid to pretty good film with a chillingly cold and calculated performance from Streep that more than steals the show.",

Here, the scriptThis film is a remake of a much older film, in which the action takes place during the Korean War and beyond, always in the context of the Cold War and the US paranoia surrounding the communist threat within its own borders. Here, the script was subject to an important update, which brought the story into a more recent chronology and context, linking to the First Gulf War and the American military presence in the Persian region.Aside from this update, the core of the plot remains: a group of American soldiers is captured by Islamic fighters, only to return some time later, with only a few casualties to mourn and led by a sergeant who, out of bravery, is turned into a war hero. Coincidence or not, this sergeant is the son of a very influential politician, and with many ambitions for his offspring. That way, it won't be long before she starts baiting her domestic hero into using her new trump card in the political arena, aimed at her election as Vice President. It turns out that there are some soldiers in that unit who begin to have nightmares where they see their comrades being brainwashed and that same war hero killing uniformed comrades under hypnosis. One of those ex-military men, Ben Marco, is determined to discover the truth and will challenge everyone and everything to find out what really happened.The movie is quite good, and it's really worth it... but that doesn't mean it's flawless or flawless. In fact, the script update has robbed it of some credibility: I don't think Islamic fighters would cooperate so easily with a powerful multinational corporation full of money and ambition, as the film suggests. However, if we decide to give the script a chance and ignore these issues, the film gives us an interesting job of entertainment, in which the 'suspense' is guaranteed and effective.Denzel Washington assures an unequivocal and solid protagonism. A safe bet, he's an effective actor in this type of film, which just makes mistakes because he seems to be doing more than we've seen him do before, in films like \"Crimson Tide\", for example. Liev Schreiber is another actor who does a good job here, in a character as complex as it is controversial: on the one hand, he's heavily manipulated, but on the other, he seems eager to break the chain that associates him with a controlling and ambitious mother, delightfully performed by the impeccable Meryl Streep. The film also features the honorable participations of Jeffrey Wright and Bruno Ganz, in minor characters that will have their relevance to the story.Technically, the film doesn't have major flaws: with a very regular and pleasant rhythm, it unfolds gradually and leaving the audience stuck to what they're watching. Cinematography is an essential part of the film's visual beauty and works flawlessly in the low light, cloudy environments and formal and impersonal settings of the offices of high politics. Of course, the costumes help as well, with good military uniforms and a flawless look from Streep (I can see why they said she was inspired by Hillary Clinton). The visuals and special effects do their job, but not too spectacularly.",

TheThis is a somewhat sinister film, with a relatively decent performance by Denzel Washington, although it didn't feel engrossing enough to fully grab my attention and I feel it missed something of substance but its hard to say quite what. The story is a sobering one - I can imagine people who may have been, shall we say tampered with, being regarded as paranoid but this isn't quite 'Men in Black' level, special effects wise or otherwise. The themes are obviously quite serious and not at all comedic really, especially in this day and age of unstable politics, I suppose. Indeed it has an element of the classic novel 1984 about it, I suppose. I felt there was perhaps an element of over acting at times, while at other times almost the opposite applied, in that there wasn't perhaps as much emotion expressed as I expected and not just down to the brainwashing aspect of the plot. However, I certainly wouldn't say the film is unwatchable - it features a decent cast with Meryl Streep, Jon Voight and Denzel Washington but I certainly wouldn't say its a particularly good film. It had/has potential and its ok but not great, so overall I wouldn't especially recommend it, no, although its certainly a thought provoking film.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThis movie disturbed me—not because it was a tense thriller, but because it falls so flat. The acting is decent enough and the cinematography and direction is alright. Where it fails is the plot and writing. So much is left out that would have driven the plot or made us feel deep emotion: connection to the protagonists or hatred for the villains. But it’s just not there.We see a lot of Streep as the frontline antagonist. But what exactly is her connection to the evil corporation behind the scenes? No idea. We barely see anything of them. And I don’t just mean on screen. There’s very little information to fill in any gaps at all. What exactly are they doing? Why are they so evil? They already completely control everything with money, so why would they need to have a brainwashed President anyway? There’s no risk here because there’s nothing to be gained.The same goes for the scientist doing the implants. What drives him? What’s his relationship to Manchurian Global or Streep’s character? Again, no idea. He’s barely present in the film either. I can’t even remember his name. We’re told he’s “South African.” Are we just supposed to assume that South African = apartheid = terrible villain? I suppose so, but why not show us something that makes us truly fear and hate him?And there’s a scientist helping The Good Guys too. Who is he? How did he become involved? What happens to him? We can guess, but we shouldn’t have to. If we guess, we’ll just come up with the same boring predictable cliches that the writers seem to have had in mind but were too lazy to bother showing us. That seems to be the intent: just insert your own cartoonish stock Bond-villains and side characters and watch the dumb movie.And the ending! It comes out of nowhere, but not in a good way, like the climax of an episode of The Twilight Zone. It’s more like they ran out of time and couldn’t think of anything truly disturbing or thought-provoking, so they lazily slapped on an “and they all lived happily ever after” epilogue. And it’s so disjointed stylistically from what just happened previously that you’re sitting there for a minute trying to figure out if this is even the same movie.Lazy is the only word for this movie. It doesn’t leave your head swimming with possibilities or fears or anything else. It just leaves you bored and annoyed.",
