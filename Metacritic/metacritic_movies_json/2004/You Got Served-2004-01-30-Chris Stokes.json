  "summary": "A new fable for the hip hop age, where the best street dancers pit their moves and their passion for a chance to turn their talent into their dreams.  (Screen Gems)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The heart of the movie, however, is the dancing, which is as spontaneous as it is spectacular, incorporating considerable gymnastics.",
    "Director Christopher B. Stokes (House Party 4) shapes up the fabulous dance sequences with undeniable energy, and real-life brothers Houston and Grandberry are two of the most enjoyable musicians to appear onscreen since Sting played a bellboy.",
    "Just pretend the acting scenes are commercial breaks, and you'll be fine.",
    "The story is so bored with itself, it collapses -- but the diverse troupe of dance talents at least makes it an eclectic slide.",
    "Part soap opera and part thriller, and it has the unique characteristic of being both undeveloped and overwritten.",
    "A street-dance film that's lively and silly and about as \"street\" as a Britney Spears video.",
    "A thinly written, hoarily cliched story that serves mostly as connective tissue between the movie's chief draw, its dazzling dance sequences.",
    "The beauty of You Got Served is that it delivers the moves from every vantage point.",
    "Seems stuck in fad mode, a showcase in search of a movie.",
    "Assembling this vehicle for his young clients, music producer/manager/video director Christopher B. Stokes has attached an anemic plot to a series of dynamic hip-hop dance sequences.",
    "A serviceable youth pic that's marginally less dumb than November's urban quasi-musical \"Honey.\"",
    "Will probably keep its core audience of suburban teenagers mildly entertained for the course of its 93 minutes. Urban grumps, however, may be distracted by Mr. Stokes's annoyingly overedited execution of the dance sequences.",
    "Ultimately Stokes remains true to his music video roots and relies on the film's flashy voltage dance scenes and frenetic pacing to keep viewers' attention from wandering.",
    "Offers viewers a trade-off: half an hour of phenomenal dancing in exchange for an hour of atrocious drama.",
    "The performers all move a lot better than they talk, which is bad news for the insipid melodrama but good news whenever the characters hit the floor in furious competitions between rival crews.",
    "If you pay out money to see this, you got fleeced.",
    "The astonishing brio and verve of street dancing deserves better than this.",
    "It's too bad more energy wasn't devoted to fleshing out the one-dimensional characters and crafting a decent script. The only reason to catch this harmless diversion is for the group dance sessions.",
    "There ain't much to You Got Served, but at least this teensploitation flick is bookended by two frenzied sequences that fully exploit the visual potential of street dancing.",
    "When a movie keeps repeating its title, you know it's a stinker.",
    "Just as clichéd as its predecessor, and lacks the old-school charm of films like \"Wild Style\" and \"Breakin’.\"",
    "This amateurish drama about street-dance contests and busted friendship is about as real as Lil' Kim's chest.",
    "Cliched, amateurish and feeble.",
    "Rarely do you encounter a movie without a shred of originality. You Got Served is such a cinematic vacuum."
