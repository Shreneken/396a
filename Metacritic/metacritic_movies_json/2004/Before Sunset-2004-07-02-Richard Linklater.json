    "critic_reviews": [
        "This is one of the most wildly romantic movies in ages.",
        "Summer sequelitis is upon us, but the season is unlikely to bring anything more remarkable than Richard Linklater's sweet, smart, and deeply romantic Before Sunset.",
        "Yep, this movie is basically a yakfest, but an incredibly fluid and involving one, and if you have any kind of affinity for either of the characters, you\u2019re bound to find the picture a kind of miracle.",
        "The new film, which unfolds in real time over the course of 80 minutes, is a deeper, darker, altogether more memorable experience. It doesn't extend the characters so much as fulfill them.",
        "This is a romance with minimal physical contact and sex--and that's part of what makes it work so well as a love story.",
        "What ultimately makes Before Sunset so special (and maybe the most resonant, least self-conscious \u201cgreat movie romance\u201d of its era) is its deep-rooted honesty -- the way it takes the bitter with the sweet and somehow leaves us feeling elated.",
        "All told, he's (Linklater) one of today's most versatile American filmmakers, and Before Sunset finds his light shining as brightly as ever.",
        "It's great to see an American filmmaker - and a successful one at that - willing to simply train his cameras on the actors and let them, and their characters, come to life.",
        "Romantic, real and as generous as it is vulnerable, the art of conversation has rarely been so acute, honest and revealing.",
        "Because Linklater now wears his heart on his sleeve, he has made a film that in its joy, optimism and aesthetic achievement keeps faith with American cinema at its finest.",
        "A movie this diminutive can be easily oversold, but we might see it on some year-end best lists. It eats at you, just like renewed love.",
        "That rose in the desert, a sequel that improves in every way upon its beloved predecessor and a romance that slowly builds a fire from embers thought dead.",
        "Magnificent but somewhat frustrating movie.",
        "Chance encounters and fated love are the stuff of fairy tales, which is what makes the deliriously romantic sequel Before Sunset a small miracle.",
        "Although there isn't a single kiss in this love story, it's intensely erotic -- and more to the point, it's not afraid of eroticsm's juicier and more forthright twin, carnality.",
        "One of the most perfect endings of any film that comes to mind.",
        "Hawke is not a brilliant actor, but here he rises to the occasion: Every inch of him registers the weight of this moment.",
        "A vibrant emotional epic.",
        "Although it is technically a sequel, Before Sunset stands perfectly well on its own. In fact, the new movie plays better if you haven't seen the original for a while, so its details have grown appropriately fuzzy.",
        "The result is a peculiar small gem, a true Linklater gem. The verity of the film, rather than any novelty or twist, keeps us fixed.",
        "The movie is an O. Henry-like conceit--the slenderness of the initial premise is part of the charm--but the anecdote becomes almost momentous as it goes on.",
        "In the spirit of the original, Linklater closes with one of the best endings of its kind since George Romero's \"Martin.\"",
        "Although the characters and their backstories are carefully thought out, Delpy and Hawke deliver their dialogue as if spontaneous and unmeditated.",
        "In the midst of summer's cinematic thunder and lightning, this is a rare moment of tranquility.",
        "The naturalistic dialogue is a masterful bit of writing, credited to Linklater and his \"Sunrise\" co-writer Kim Krizan, as well as to the two stars.",
        "The film has the materials for a lifetime project; like the \"7-Up\" series, this is a conversation that could be returned to every 10 years or so, as Celine and Jesse grow older.",
        "This is a sequel just as intriguing as the original.",
        "The ex-lovers' new conversation is stimulating and banal, selfish and broad-minded, affectionate and recriminatory, insightful and obtuse - in short, the kind of dialogue two people might have while pouring out their hearts and poring over their pasts.",
        "The sequel is an uninterrupted 80-minute dialogue between two richly imagined and performed characters.",
        "A savvy sequel that should speak to anyone who's let that one great love slip away.",
        "The script of Before Sunset is both rambling and self-conscious, and at times it has the self-important sound of clever writing. But though it is sometimes maddening, the movie's prodigious verbiage is also enthralling.",
        "The bad news is that Before Sunset is not as delirious an experience as its predecessor. The good news is that it's wonderful anyway, and in ways that tell us something about our romance with \"Before Sunrise.\"",
        "Anything that inspires that many whoops, gasps and groans with only two actors and a few choice words has earned its place at the summertime box office trough.",
        "There is something uniquely unforgettable in the way Linklater, Hawke and Delpy (equal collaborators on the script) find nuance, art and eroticism in words, spoken and unspoken. The actors shine.",
        "This sweet film is a genuine treat, even if there's little plot, no antic mayhem and its 90-minute running time is mostly consumed by nonstop, sometimes pretentious dialogue.",
        "Meandering but reasonably charming.",
        "An intelligent, engagingly honest study of love lost and, just maybe, regained.",
        "All foreplay and no climax."

Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are yet againA continuation of Richard Linklater's \"stream of consciousness\" romance trilogy, Before Sunset is better than Before Sunrise, but not by much, because both are still phenomenal pieces of cinema. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are yet again fantastic in this film with their chemistry together on display for all to see. The two of them seem to just bounce off of one another and it gives the love between them a realistic feeling. Featuring the same hilarious moments, honest and riveting dialogue, and pure romance, as the first film, the thing that puts Before Sunset above Before Sunrise for me is the way in which the characters have grown. In the first film, they are innocent. They are both romantics who may not be open about this due to parts of their past, but deep down, they believe in love and \"the one\". Now, both are jaded and unhappy. Yet, though they claim otherwise, both are still romantics. They are simply both afraid to be hurt further and show the scars of love lost. There is a longing between both of them that has left both unsatisfied in other endeavors. Their dialogue suggests they are now both cynics who no longer believe in love, but in reality, it portrays them as people who deny their true feelings because they are afraid of it falling apart all over again. For this, Before Sunset shows great maturity amid its romance that leaves hope for the future, yet that hope is tempered and covered in doubt. What will happen? Will they find happiness? A brilliant film, Before Sunset shows Richard Linklater's talent as a writer and director for all to see.",

My experience was the polar opposite of the one I had with the first film in this series. The dialogue in Before Sunrise was fresh, romantic, and funny. The characters were endearing, I cared what happened to them and I wanted them to be together. In Before Sunset the characters have become jaded. They have white people problems. Life just is not turning out how they had hoped. They have good jobs, and people who love them but it is not enough. They want the romance back in their life, for things to be new again. Where in the first film it felt like they respected each others opinion, they were free to disagree without judgement. Here it feels as though they are preaching at each other. I'm right because my experiences dictate that I'm right. Your opinions are less valuable then mine because you don't have the same worldly experiences as me. These are certainly not unusually drawn characters for 30 somethings with similar cultural backgrounds, and are probably accurate more times than not. However spending an hour and a half with no one but these two people was not the pleasure it was the first time around, and at times was insufferable.\r My respect for Hawke's character lessens even further in the third act when he begins to talk about his marriage. This is not a spoiler as we are to notice his ring right away and frequently throughout the first half. It is obvious he values little of the institution he has entered into, and instead has taken the typical modern approach to his vows. Perhaps and likely all of my issues with the film are Linklater's point. Perhaps these are typical views for people their age. my problem is I spent the first film with unique people. Characters who were looking at the world differently, with compassion and understanding. I couldn't wait to spend time with those people again. Those people are gone.",

How can anyone take to heart the intellectual prattling of a man who is willing to walk out on his wife and 4 year old son for a fantasy relationship with a woman he has known for 9 hours.? Its disgusting, spineless and utterly selfish. Ethan Hwake's character needs to hurry home, help his wife with the dishes and take his son to tee ball. Delpy needs to stick with unmarried men and maybe volunteer caring for infants at a maternity ward or something. It seems to me that we should be cheering couples with children on rather than telling stories that romanticize abandoning one's family. Am I the only one who finds this profoundly disturbing?",

A deeply appealing two-hander about anBack in 1995, Richard Linklater  until then best-known for Slacker and Dazed And Confused  left Kevin Smith to chronicle America's waster youth and made a small, offbeat romance called Before Sunrise. A deeply appealing two-hander about an American backpacker (Hawke) and a French student (then-unknown Delpy) who meet on a train and talk their way around Vienna, Before Sunrise charmed romantically-inclined twentysomethings everywhere. The crux of the matter in that film, of course, is that at the end the pair agree to meet six months on. Would they be there? Would they live happily ever after? It was fun to daydream, but ultimately, was that even the point? It is now. A decade later, Linklater  rejoined by his two stars, who share the writing credits  has produced a \"real-time\" sequel, catching up with Jesse and Celine nine years down the road  a prospect that must strike both joy and trepidation into the hearts of devotees. Have they spoilt it all? Conversely, will it mean anything to those new to the pair? Should it ever have been made? The answers to these are broadly no, yes (there are even helpful flashbacks to the first film  but oh don't they show how shockingly gaunt Hawke has become!) and, well, the third could generate debates to rival those of our spirited protagonists. Certainly there are problems with the film. A mere 80 minutes long, like Before Sunrise the structure of Before Sunset  two people wander aimlessly, arguing, flirting, ultimately rejoicing in each other  is not on paper the stuff of high drama, and some will find the lack of a definite story arc undisciplined and unengaging. Potentially more damaging is the abruptness of the ending which, coupled with the short running time, could leave some viewers wondering if the last reel slipped down the back of a filing cabinet. Teasingly frustrating in its ambiguity, the final scene  languid, heady, sexy as hell  eschews a solid, conventionally dramatic conclusion, instead taunting us with yet more questions  some will love this, but after the building tension of the preceding moments, others will demand more. That said, there is still so much to love about Linklater's literate, candid, and this time necessarily more sombre film. Jesse and Celine, now in their early 30s and in theory older and wiser, are still as delightfully real as they were ten years ago. All credit to Hawke and Delpy, who hardly seem to be acting; they just are these characters. Meeting up by (almost) chance in Paris with mere hours until Jesse has to leave, the shell-shocked pair walk the streets of Le Marais and the Latin Quarter, stumbling from awkwardly polite niceties to heartfelt confessions and anxieties touching the very core of their \"grown-up\" lives  the poignancy of regret, the loneliness of failing relationships, the agonising conflict between desire and duty  universal subjects that extend beyond the parameters of Jesse and Celine's story and will strike a chord even with those unfamiliar with the first film. While some might balk at such wordiness, the film is far from earnest or depressing, full of humour and joy  and the three writers counter any chance of boredom by dropping mini bombshells at regular intervals; tiny ripples on the Richter Scale, perhaps, but hugely important twists in the context of this couple. Set against the beauty of Paris  cinematographer Lee Daniel hardly has to try!  it's near impossible not to be seduced by this picture, the director nevertheless cranking up the aesthetics by filming the city in long, golden-dappled tracking shots that soothe the eye just as he tightens the emotional screws. An involving and all too fleeting joy.",

'Sunset' is my favourite of the two,  perhaps the most beautifully romantic movie of all time! Kudos to the director that makes himself invisible and reels you in with his skill and kudos to the actors that absolutely make you fall in love with and root for them! What strikes me is how each time I watch this movie, I discover something new relatable in the conversation. And then there are the questions! Is duty more important than authenticity? Is time relevant? Is love worth the risk? The price? What does it mean being mature and responsible? Are the choices we make truly our own or is fate and circumstance the defining factor? I find Jesse to be the more hopeful about life in this round, in spite of his miserable marriage and Celine the more vulnerable in spite of all the armour she has built over the years to avoid pain. The boat and the car scene are for me among the most memorable moments I have ever experienced at the movies. The ending could not have been more fitting and perfect, but somehow I have no doubt about the outcome, he has no choice but to miss that plane. Can't wait to listen in on another walk and talk of these two in a month or so in 'Before Midnight'. Am I a goofball or what!",

What Linklater is so good at when it comes to making these romance films is adding realism and making some factual messages about love and also shows us the talent that stars/co-writers Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have in the screenplay, they make these words nuance erotic. The pacing is amazing, the cinematography is fabulous and the locations are spot on. Nine years later, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) travels around across Europe giving readings of his novel he wrote about him in Vienna with Celine (Julie Delpy). After his reading in Paris in a library Celine finds him and they spend a day before Jesse again has to leave for a flight. Their both in a relationships now, and Jesse has a son and a wife, but as their strong feelings for each other start to return, both confess a longing for more. The film still is engaging and the chemistry between Hawke and Delpy is charming and witty, it's equally good as the first one. Grade A+",

They don't live in constant violence and are not judged for what they are not. They simply live their lives with a lot of questions as they make difficult things that are not supposed to be that way. I guess it is what makes this feature poetic and beautiful : it underlines how men and women don't accept happiness and manage to torture themselves in one the most horrible way there is. They tend to accept events only partially, in the easiest or most meaningful way they can. And Linklater managed to make us spectators of it.",

Its an easy, laid back style watch which doesn't rely on cheap humour (toilet/anatomical jokes etc.). Its basically one long conversation with lots of small talk but yet the dialogue is quite good, some of it poignant and possibly relatable - I found it an insightful and cheery watch overall. It was nice to see the characters again and it was somehow re-assuring that the two main characters were able to re-start their conversation, as if they hadn't spent many years apart. It has a natural feel, it doesn't seem forced or bland or boring and indeed I reckon Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have a good on screen chemistry. This is the sort of film that could become a bit tedious and slow paced, in terms of the basic plot but I enjoyed it, with the random subjects covered (hypothetical situations discussed and so on) and the decent performances.For once, I enjoyed that this isn't a fast paced film, as it were.
