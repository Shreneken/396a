  "critic_reviews": [
    "A different kind of Harry Potter movie, a better kind... It's where this fantasy series has wanted to go all along.",
    "The Prisoner of Azkaban is to Harry Potter what that other No. 3, \"Goldfinger,\" was to James Bond: the movie that takes the invention and gamesmanship of the series to a whole new giddy peak.",
    "Soars gloriously into fluency and magic.",
    "One of the greatest fantasy films of all time.",
    "The most powerfully entrancing children's film in years. Of course, a true kid's classic is just as magical for adults.",
    "Potter 3 is, in its heart of hearts, a teenage angst movie...Cuaron has done a masterful job of bringing off this shift in the Potter paradigm without disrupting any disruption in the established style of the series and without any pandering concessions to the teen-movie genre.",
    "A deeper, darker, visually arresting and more emotionally satisfying adaptation of the J.K. Rowling literary phenomenon, achieving the neat trick of remaining faithful to the spirit of the book while at the same time being true to its cinematic self.",
    "The best of the Harry Potter films so far, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is also hands down the scariest, and the deepest.",
    "Like the first two movies, this is loaded with computer-generated imagery, but for the first time there's a sense of dramatic proportion balancing the spectacle and the story line.",
    "Not only is this dazzler by far the best and most thrilling of the three Harry Potter movies to date, it's a film that can stand on its own even if you never heard of author J.K. Rowling and her young wizard hero.",
    "With Cuaron leading the way, Harry has burst from the printed page to soar on-screen.",
    "[Cuaron]'s a visionary and crafty storyteller who rewards your patience, not with twists in the plot, though the movie has its share, but with pure feeling. Deploying wit, grace, and artistry, he's whisked a kid flick into adolescence.",
    "Is Prisoner of Azkaban as good as the first two films? Not quite. It doesn't have that sense of joyously leaping through a clockwork plot, and it needs to explain more than it should. But the world of Harry Potter remains delightful, amusing and sophisticated.",
    "Who would think Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban could be an art film? Thanks to director Alfonso Cuaron, a dazzling storyteller with a keen eye for whimsical detail, the third film in the Potter franchise is a visual delight.",
    "An entrancing experience for Potter fans. It's a carefully crafted, dreamy immersion in a world that feels snugly familiar even when evil intrudes.",
    "This movie belongs to its young stars, who have grown immensely as actors since they were first ideally cast by Chris Columbus, the hack who directed the first two movies.",
    "In an era when most scripts are written by committees of monkeys, hearing one man's intelligent voice is an almost forgotten pleasure.",
    "Shot in spooky gradations of silver and shadow, The Prisoner of Azkaban is the first movie in the series with fear and wonder in its bones, and genuine fun, too.",
    "Much has been made about the fact that the world's most popular fictional children are growing up and straight into that horror-filled no man's land of the human life span, puberty.",
    "The result is a film that's really moving--and really moves.",
    "Enjoy the savory witches' brew that Cuaron has cooked up in his Harry pot. For on its own terms, this one is truly wizard.",
    "In the Harry Potter film series thus far, The Sorcerer's Stone remains the strongest, perhaps because the first look at any rich new world is almost always going to be more groundbreaking than its sequels. But Prisoner of Azkaban is a worthy and stylistically different follow-up, where Chamber of Secrets often felt like an unimaginative retread.",
    "In Cuarón's hands, the world of Harry Potter doesn't feel like a synthetic movie theme park anymore. It's almost real, Hogwarts and all.",
    "Azkaban breaks free of all these shackles in its final hour. Working with the persuasive Thewlis and Oldman, able to focus his gifts on what's distinctive, dramatic and surprising about the story, Cuarón creates on screen the heartfelt magic that has enthralled so many on the page.",
    "This film may disappoint some dogmatic Old Hogwartsians: a few plot points have been sacrificed, and Mr. Cuarón does not seem to care much for Quidditch. But it more than compensates for these lapses with its emotional force and visual panache.",
    "It helps that J.K. Rowling’s third book in the series is full of spooky stuff that translates beautifully to screen.",
    "Although Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban stands well enough on its own, it has a \"middle chapter\" feeling. In other words, there's no real beginning or ending. Little is resolved and the film's climax is low-key.",
    "From its restlessly moving camera work to its heartfelt acting by a splendid cast, \"Azkaban\" is a horror movie for mature kids.",
    "Here, finally, is a Harry Potter picture that lives up to its potential -- that, plainly, LIVES.",
    "In the end, Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban offers what neither of its predecessors, for all their wand-waving and witch-brooms, had: real magic.",
    "Visually dazzling and considerably darker than the prior incarnations, the story suffers from a slightly disjointed feel that will prove less accessible to those not intimately familiar with every corner of author J.K. Rowling's world.",
    "A mild upkick in pacing and texture can be credited to director Alfonso Cuarón (more Little Princess than Y Tu Mamá), who avoids Chris Columbus's mastodon-like setups and knows a bit more about whipping up atmospherics.",
    "With shades of Carrie, Harry's magical powers and adolescent angst make a combustible fusion, taking on frightening, vengeful implications that Cuarón honors by refusing to airbrush the shadowy regions of fantasy.",
    "It's not perfect, or even close, but it delivers on the promise of J.K. Rowling's novels to a far greater extent.",
    "From my doddering perspective - rheumy with a view - Volume 3 puts plenty of cinema into the picture but leeches all the charm out of the tale.",
    "Azkaban contains both the longest denouement and the most rousing finish of any of the books, and Cuarón wisely whips through the 'ah-hahs' so that the clever climax, complete with the series' best SFX, can enjoy its moment in the moonlight.",
    "Cuaron lets his enthusiasms show.",
    "If my moviegoing experience was magical in any way, it was only in that I once or twice nodded off for a spell.",
    "Put delicately, this is one long sit, made all the more so by a turgid story, a dour visual palette and uninspiring action."

Azkaban was a return to the magical formula that made Harry PotterIn year three, our cast of unique and magical characthers have to deal with a new threat, an escaped prisoner, from Azkaban Prison, who seems to want to kill Harry Potter. Azkaban was a return to the magical formula that made Harry Potter legendary. The story here is suburb and unlike the Chamber of Secrets, it isn't dummied down or rushed for us. New elements are introduced such as the secret map and time travel, but perhaps most important of all we finally see Harry demonstrate some of this incredible power that has led to his fame at Hogwarts. The story was terrific, the action was great, the performances were off the chart, and the childish stuff was kept to a minimum, but was Azkaban perfect? Many critics will tell you that this is the best of the Potter films and it was terrific, but personally I was hoping to see more of the world outside of Hogwarts. I was looking forward to possibly seeing the inside of Azkaban prison and some of the people who are locked up there. While I appreciate the different views and new filming location, it was still centered at Hogwarts. Not a bad thing, but personally I'd have liked to have seen something else. Aside from that, new Director, Alfonso Cuaron, does use parts of the story that were excluded in the previous films, he also does give us a new location, and view of things. Overall, Cuaron really does do a tremendous job, making this film geared more toward young adults than children. Azkaban is much closer to being what J.K. Rowling intended than the Chamber of Secrets was. I absolutely loved this film, there are just some parts of this film that are truly amazing. If you're picky like I am, and are only going to give Harry Potter one shot, then I suggest the film you watch is The Prisoner of Azkaban.",

He still hasn't fully understood that he will in the end have an epic battle with Voldemort because he has an ultimate desire too. Lord Voldemort is very powerful, but his lurking presence around the halls of Hogwarts doesn't frighten him as much as it used to.

Watching the films in this way really emphaszies how different the third film is from its predecessors. If I had not seen the first two films I would probabyl have rated this film a bit higher, but what bothered me was that this director chose to change both the scenery and Hogwarth's structure/routines. I liked that the first two films played up Hogwarth's similarities to traditional English boarding schools, and I was especialyl disappointed to see that this new director chose to \"modernize\" so many things (including the street clothing the characters wear for much of this film). Most significant is the castign change for the role of Professor Dumbledore. Another reviewere noted here that Dumbledore is the centre of the novels, and it's important to really feel that he's trustworthy as a leader. The late Richard Harris was wonderful; the new actor plays Dumbledore as a bit of a joke, and this bothered me. Dumbledore is portrayed in this film as a doddering old man, which is absolutely contrary to the books themselves and to the prior 2 films. All in all, this film will probably be most appreciated by people who haven't read the books or seen either of the previous films.",

The actors were very entertaining (again) and I can say nothing more about Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, or anyone else. The only actor that I have to say to is Michael Gambon for his wonderful performance as Professor Dumbledore. The CGI was cool (again) and even the action was cool (again).

The direction that this movie took the series into a darker tone was fantastic. The performances from Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, David Thewlis, Gary Oldman, Rupert Grint, Emma Thompson, Tom Felton, Alan Rickman, and Maggie Smith stupendous. The visual effects were spectacular especially the Dementor's, the Whomping Willow, Buckbeak the hippogriff, the Knight Bus, and The Monster Book of Monsters. The writing, story and screenplay were amazing. The movies film score was great just like the others have been. The scenery and set continue to be very nice and cool. The costumes were great in the movie. A+.",

The cast, however, remains the same, which allows to this film doesn't seems a totally different thing from the first two, although there are changes in the way the story is told and seen. One of the most obvious changes is the gradual abandonment of the use of black school robes, almost ubiquitous in the first two movies. For some fans, its a transition to another stage of the film franchise. Also notable is the arrival of Michael Gambon to the role of Albus Dumbledore, left vacant by the death of Richard Harris. Although loyalty and attachment to the original book and it's details is a feature that will come to gradually disappearing, this movie still follows closely the history of the book.

Personally, changing things is the weakest point of this movie. If you haven't read the book then you'll either find it very confusing or you'll love it, but if you've read the book then nothing will stop you from finding faults and flaws. The story... well If they just wouldn't have deleted some main plots, it would have been as good as its predecessors. Not including the plots from the book is understandable but introducing new things is unacceptable. Acting... the trio have matured very much and I'd still say they were born for these roles. All the adults are great as usual. The two new actors, David as Lupin was perfect but Michael Gambon as Dumbledore... oh boy! Erase what I said in the beginning about the alterations in the plot being its weakest point. No! Michael Gambon is the weakest point of the movie. He sucks big time!!! He has tarnished the Dumbledore portrayed by the versatile actor Richard Harris and the character created by the prolific writer J.K.Rowling. Michael Gambon - one of the major reasons why I disliked the movie, the other reason was the tiny whomping willow. Direction... I don't know why Warner bros removed Chris. It's not that Alfonso is not talented, but changing a director breaks a smooth flow which was found between movie 1 and 2. Sorceror's and chambers felt like it was from the same world but this movie feels like a whole new world, only the characters are same. Chris had improved upon chamber of secrets by making it dark and suspenseful and with prisoner he would have made a hell of a movie (mean it in a positive manner). Visuals... for a 2004 movie it's visuals are excellent. Even today they look fantastic! Overall I'd rate this movie a B+. I would have given it an A if the director hadn't changed the small details which makes it very different from the books and the predecessor movies.",

AlfonsoThe third instalment in the hugely successful franchise leaps onto the screen with rapturous confidence, completely reinventing what we remember from the first two and paving its own path to be quite possibly the best in the series. Alfonso Quarón has stepped away from the friendly and sophisticated technique that Chris Columbus used in the previous films and injects the series with a much needed sense of purpose, that the stories are all somehow connected and we can be a part of this growing tale.\rThere is certainly a sense of maturity as the film unfolds, there is much more of a gritty story and darker content that will amaze and even frighten, and it is visually stunning.\rHarry (Daniel Radcliffe) is preparing to attend his third year at Hogwarts, but as the story goes not everything is going to go smoothly. He finds himself on the Knight Bus, a magical vehicle which transports him to Diagon Alley where he is informed that he is in very grave danger, his godfather, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban, and is out to finish the work of ridding the world of the Potter family.\rBut Harry has his own demons. literally. He introduced to the Dementors, gruesome and soulless beings, hooded and terrifying. They are searching for Black, and give Harry nothing but grief, something his returning friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) pick up on.\rThe third film is such a delight that it is the little additions that make a difference, the flicker of a wand now has a whirring sound to accompany it, it still maintains a comic touch but introduces an almost relatable world that we could be a part of, these school kids go to class with shirts hanging out, they bully and fight with each other, this is a school after all.\rThe addition of key characters is welcome to the series. Michael Gambon takes a daring and edgy approach as the new Albus Dumbledore, his presence is energetic and youthful, making his own mark in the role is excellent to see. David Thewlis plays the mysterious put helpful Professor Lupin, the new man in charge of Defence Against the Dark Arts, something and someone Harry comes to know much more. We also have the crackpot Divination teacher Professor Trelawney, who has a few too many crystals balls to read.\rAs mentioned, the film is stunning to watch, its visuals when being used with the mountains of Scotland are quite exasperating, Hogwarts has truly never looked better, placing it atop a mountainside and introducing various alleyways of discovery has truly been brought to life by Quarón.\rAs a fan of the books, I was pleasantly surprised at how insightful, inventive and enjoyable this film adaption was, it has all the seasons, all the mishaps, all the laughter, but somehow manages to push itself to the top of one of the greatest of the series, it is perhaps the little touches that made all the difference.",

Perhaps, in writing this review, it is a good timeHeralded as the best entry in the Harry Potter film franchise, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is certainly the best film thus far, though I do hope it is not the best film overall. Perhaps, in writing this review, it is a good time to admit one of my greatest cinematic sins: I really do not see the hype with Alfonso Cuaron. In fact, I really do not like his work all that much. Having seen all but two of his films, it is becoming increasingly clear that there is something in his films that really turns me off. They look, feel, and sound like cinematic classics, but lack that crucial element to make them truly soar above the competition, when they are good as is the case with Prisoner of Azkaban and Gravity. While A Little Princess left me feeling a little indifferent, I found Children of Men to be impeccably underwhelming and I really had to gut it through Y Tu Mama Tambien, which was one of the worst films I have ever seen due to how juvenile, crude, and vulgar of a film it turned out to be. Yet, in saying all of this, I let myself get overhyped for Prisoner of Azkaban due to word of mouth and the presence of Cuaron. Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me five times, definitely shame on me at this point.What really holds the film back is how rushed everything feels. While the film's plotting is surprisingly tight and lacking in exposition and diversions into various wacky elements of the wizarding world, the film is a weird position. It is still a long film (though shorter than its predecessors), but feels far more rushed than either of them. It would have been better served being as long as the other films, even though those films were hurt by their length. By further developing scenes, characters, and dialogue, the film would feel more adequately paced instead of being a speeding bullet to the finish line. The film's climax and falling action are particularly susceptible to this with the film ditching its slow build-up to revealing Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), exploring the dementors, and building fantastic atmospheric tension. With the film introducing time travel during the climax, quickening the pace is perhaps a technique used by Cuaron to make the film less repetitive. However, the quickened pace really undermines the most important of the film: Harry meeting his godfather Sirius and learning the truth behind his parent's death. Instead of letting the emotional weight of this reveal take hold, the film rushes through and then half-heartedly tries to go back to these moments with characters explaining exactly how they felt, such as when Harry explains the secrets behind the encounter by the lake to Hermione. It is admittedly a series aimed at children, yet like its predecessors, it feels the need to explain details that are either inconsequential or obvious to the children in the audience. As a result of this, the film never really convinces anybody regarding Sirius' turn around from lead villain to kind godfather. Harry seems all too willing to believe anything about this man who he was told was loyal to Voldemort. It makes no sense, even if the film does it best to try and go back to convince you it made sense. It is touching, sure, but Cuaron never really made the moment feel earned or realistic. Thus, the film feels rather lacking in heart and soul. It has spirit for sure, but feels far too pedestrian and safe to really knock it out of the park, which is a real Cuaron trademark.That said, Cuaron really does add some terrific touches in bringing the novel to life. Taking the Spielbergian child-like wonder of Chris Columbus' first two films and blending it with a much darker world, the first hour of the Prisoner of Azkaban is a master class in atmospheric tension. Starting off with the ominous train ride in which the dementors are introduced and the groundwork for Sirius Black's shocking escape from Azkaban prison is laid out, the film becomes both a treat for the eyes via good special effects and a thrilling experience. With the slow reveal of the dementors via the freezing of the bus and their terrifying encounter with Harry on the train, Cuaron sets the scene perfectly for just how terrifying these figures will become in the film, often far exceeding Sirius' menacing exterior in the beginning. It is honestly this tremendous build-up for Sirius with such an ominous feeling in the air whenever he is mentioned that the film's ending feels so unconvincing. Fortunately, that build-up is so good, it is hard to deny that the film is a truly haunting and mesmerizing experience for much of its runtime.Cuaron also smartly takes advantage of the design of Hogwarts to add to the ominous nature of the film. With the pictures watching the kids' every move, the film begins to feel very much like a gothic horror at times with how much the building factors into the fright factor. With an intricate design as always, the long looming features of the school are an ominous sight on their own.",

However, Cuarón makes up for such flaws with a loveable style and new ways of story-telling his directorial predecessor Chris Columbus didn’t venture. I personally adored the cinematography of Michael Seresin, especially the establishing shots of season and location that were used in an almost Arthaus-fashion in Prisoner of Azkaban. Not only that, but Cuarón also fully succeeded (at least in my opinion) in making what is likely the most difficult story of all seven novels understandable. I had some issues with the obvious way he depicted Hermione’s time-travelling (if you didn’t get it by the fifth time Ron stated “Hermione, you weren’t there when we came into this class” then your intelligence might be sub-par), but he excelled himself in other parts, i.e. in the subject of Sirius Black.\rCue Sirius Black, with Gary Oldman the director got a fantastic actor to work with and the Englishman established one of the most likeable characters in the series with an excellent performance. Three other wonderful English thespians joined the ever-growing HP cast, namely David Thewlis, Timothy Spall, and Michael Gambon, with the latter actually giving a better (and more philosophical) Dumbledore than the late Richard Harris. And despite a lot of problems I had in the first two films, the three main child actors got significantly better with Cuarón to direct them, which indicated for the first time that Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are in fact talented actors.\rAltogether, I greatly enjoyed Prisoner of Azkaban, which turned out to be a humorous while still serious approach to J.K. Rowling’s novel and impressed me through outstanding visual (and aural  John Williams did another splendid score) work.",
