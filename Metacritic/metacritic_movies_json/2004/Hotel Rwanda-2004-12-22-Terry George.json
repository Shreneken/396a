    "summary": "Based on true events from the civil war in Rwanda, this film profiles Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), the manager of a luxury hotel who opened his establishment to Tutsi refugees despite the danger to himself and his family.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Emerges as an African version of \"Schindler's List.\"",
        "Deep movie emotions for me usually come not when the characters are sad, but when they are good. You will see what I mean.",
        "An extraordinary and effective film.",
        "Enraging and enthralling.",
        "Several times, Hotel Rwanda teeters on the edge of making a unique, visionary statement about our times, but can't quite do it. Too bad. If it could have pulled itself together in one brilliant scene, this may have been a great movie, instead of just a very good one.",
        "Cheadle impressively carries the entire picture, delivering the kind of note-perfect performance that's absolutely deserving of Oscar consideration.",
        "The film turns into a triumph for Don Cheadle, who never steps outside the character for emotional grandstanding or easy moralism.",
        "It is a powerful portrait of a slightly befuddled man who, when inhuman demands were placed on him, found within himself an unexpected response.",
        "A startlingly effective and upsetting political melodrama.",
        "Magnificent.",
        "This role could represent a career performance for Cheadle, whose forceful and multi-dimensional portrayal keeps Hotel Rwanda at a consistently high level.",
        "One of the year's best.",
        "By turns harrowing and stirring, it\u2019s a shame-inducing history lesson that never feels like a lecture.",
        "Not a striking film visually. It's deliberately plain looking, focused on the appalling events with an almost documentary immediacy.",
        "A gut-punch of a drama.",
        "An articulate plea to Westerners not to repeat these terrible sins of omission.",
        "Cheadle's performance elevates Hotel Rwanda, making it a film that does justice to the tragedy it commemorates.",
        "Hotel Rwanda, based on real lives and events, aims unequivocally to break your heart.",
        "Ultimately, one's reservations are overwhelmed by the story's urgency; it's impossible not to be shattered.",
        "Cheadle's quiet, superbly modulated performance as an ordinary man driven to heroism by hellish events reminds us that the slogan \"no justice, no peace\" has a private as well as a public dimension.",
        "Cheadle is extraordinary.",
        "Cheadle, always a fine actor, is outstanding here--an almost willfully naive yet uncommonly decent man who sees civilization crashing and burning around him yet who, almost against his own better judgment, refuses to give in to it.",
        "It sweeps over you with blunt, unequivocal conviction.",
        "It's a weighty message movie, but it's a message worth delivering \u2013 and the cast's delivery is flawless.",
        "Scrappy, powerful, and shocking.",
        "George has been criticized for simplifying a complex story into an African \"Schindler's List.\" But despite flaws in execution, this is a film of rare courage and imperishable heart.",
        "In condensing Rusesabagina's story, George has undoubtedly overstated the specific dramatic moments; the movie has more cliff-hangers than the \"Indiana Jones\" series.",
        "All we can do is hope that films such as Hotel Rwanda remind us all -- moviegoer and politician -- of the terrible cost of doing nothing.",
        "Throughout the film, Cheadle's eyes are constantly scanning his environment for opportunities or anything that may be amiss.",
        "I wish Hotel Rwanda felt like something more than a very, very good TV movie.",
        "The genocide of some one million Rwandan Tutsis by their Hutu neighbors remains a disgraceful and too-little-known episode in recent world history. Alas, Terry George's ineffectual Hotel Rwanda only partly rectifies that problem, taking what ought to have been a complex, powerful inquiry and simplifying it to a story about the resilience of the human spirit.",
        "It's a gut-twisting story handled, largely and predictably, with asbestos mitts.",
        "The story it tells is such a wrenching one it cannot help but move us, especially when the performance of a lifetime by Don Cheadle is added to the mix.",
        "A political thriller based on fact that hammers every button on the emotional console.",
        "The Rwandan genocide was one of the most shameful marks on Bill Clinton's presidency, but for all the film's powerful images, George stops short of the forceful political statement that Rusesabagina's story demands.",
        "It's a great part for a great actor and Cheadle does a magnificent job turning this living legend back into flawed, flesh-and-blood reality.",
        "A strange history lesson that leaves us more overlectured than properly overwhelmed.",
        "The subject is crucially important, but the movie dilutes its impact with by-the-numbers filmmaking, and Cheadle's one-note performance displays few of his acting gifts.",
        "The film presents the Rwandans in the worst possible way: venal, corrupt, vicious, stupid, barbaric and completely incapable of governing themselves. Honestly, I've seen more intelligent and sympathetic depictions of Africans in Tarzan movies."

Hotel Rwanda is beautifully shot and the scenery is striking while still being authentic without being too clean. The story is always compelling and powerful, with plenty of gut-wrenching and poignant moments while never feeling preachy. The film is excellently directed and scripted too, while Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Pheonix and particularly Don Cheadle give superb acting performances. Overall, a truly fantastic film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Imagine having to choose, as a Hutu, whether to kill your neighbors and their children, or have yourself and your children be killed. That is what many of the nay-saying critics below do not understand. In that genocide there were three types of people; the Hutu extremists, the Tuitsi victims and the moderate Hutus. The extremists killed the other to groups bcause both were a threat to their goal: To wipe out the entire Tutsi population. At the end of thd movie, when the Tutsi \"rebels\" are shooting at the Hutus who are evacuating the country, it is also important to understand two more things; One, the group of Hutus running away is made up of mostly innocent Hutus but the Tutsi \"Rebel\" Army neither knows this or have the time to figure it out. Two, most of the \"rebels\" have lost family and friends to these people and therefore are pursuing reckless revenge, hence the \"not caring\" part.

You'll want to pretend what you've seen was never real because the movie saves up its violence. Despite being set during a genocide, it is very sparing with the horrors it shows, giving each incident a much greater emotional impact. Don Cheadle's amazing performance as the movie's highly sympathetic and interesting main character serves as the backbone of the plot. The events that bombard him are infinitely watchable and morbidly engrossing, and take your mind off the movie's few flaws. Hotel Rwanda does very little to explain the conflict between the Hutus and the Tutsis, and the genocidal antagonists are nearly all one-dimensional - plot points that are casualties to what this movie is about. It isn't about the Rwandan holocaust, but the events in that man's life as Rwanda fell apart. Its messages are bitter, of shame to the foreigners who didn't care or didn't do anything to intervene, of native cowardice, and of the terror of irrational hatred and chaotic violence. Yet it is not a hopeless movie, nor even a pessimistic movie. It's simply honest, and more emotionally balanced than you could expect it to be. And again, anything unrealistic is saved, because it really happened. By far one of the best \"based on a true story\" movies to date.",

I challenge anyone with a decent IQ and a bit of humanity in them not to be moved by it. The performances of the two leads are outstanding and the film conveys the full horror of the atrocities that occured. A film I am not ashamed to say moved me to tears but also left me feeling uncomfortable with my own apathy to the horrors that took place in the mid 90's. This film ranks as one of my favourite of all time not quite as good as the similar themed Schindlers List but equally as heart breaking.",

The opening song just didn't fell right to me and really messed with the tone the movie would try to set later. There were some rather intense scenes and some scenes that made you shake your head with disgust, but the emotional attachment and the tears that should follow an uplifting story just weren't there. It might have been that the movie was a bit short (I know 2 hours isn't short but with a movie that is so character driven it never hurts to be a bit longer) and you never really got attached to the victims as we did with Schindler's List. I am in no way implying that Hotel Rwanda isn't good as it is a very good movie and one that all people should watch to educate themselves about what is really happening in Africa today, but only that it could have been a home-run but felt more like a triple!",

I think the actors although aren't well known (apart from Nick Nolte) surprise! I was glad to see that Americans don't get to save everybody, as in several war movies! Very true what the reporter talks about the people watching the news and say \"Oh, my God, how awful\" and continue to dine with their families! Is what we do! But I think it might be different if anything awaken within us to show that we can indeed act. A film about violence, but also about hope, which I think everyone should see!",

Without Cheadle's performance, the film would still be very good, but his performance elevates it into the stratosphere of \"great\" films. The film, at every turn, leaves you on the brink of tears with its power as it pulls the back the cover on the Rwandan genocide. At no point did Rwanda receive the level of help they needed from the Western world, which is truly tragic and is touched on repeatedly throughout the film. An absolute indictment of the West and those who let this atrocity happen, Hotel Rwanda is just the Rwandan Schindler's List. It is far more than that and, honestly, may be just as good or better than that film. Cheadle is phenomenal and he truly commands the screen in Terry George's breathtaking and important film.",

Not even the Holocaust was portrayed in film as hard as we can see in this film, where the theme is Rwanda's genocide, by the eyes of a friendly hotel manager who just wants to protect himself and his family. They are caught in the midst of a series of political and social twists that escalate and turn into a genocidal civil war, and we can see how they suffer and fear for their lives. The way they quickly capture our sympathy turns their fears into our fears, in a powerful and very emotional way. Suddenly, those deaths also affect us and the initial sense of detachment fades. What more could a movie want? Despite this, the film isn't very graphic, we are spared the most painful scenes, although it has many shocking scenes. The film also criticizes the inability of UN to intervene there and save lives. Don Cheadle led the cast and made the biggest film of his career to date, shining in an inspired and profound performance. The environment, the scenery, the costumes... everything was meticulously thought out to reproduce the events and the realism paid of.
