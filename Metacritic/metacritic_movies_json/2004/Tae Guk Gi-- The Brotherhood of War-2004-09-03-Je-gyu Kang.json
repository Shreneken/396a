  "title": "Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War",
  "rating": 8.1,
  "release_date": "2004-09-03",
  "summary": "A story of two brothers set against the backdrop of the Korean War.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "An intense, powerful film.",
    "The most costly and the most popular film in South Korean history is also one of the most gripping and epic war films ever made, and certainly the only one I can think of the portrays the Korean war from the viewpoint of both sides of the conflict.",
    "Belongs to that brand of sweeping, conflict-era drama epitomized by \"Saving Private Ryan,\" \"Gone with the Wind\" and TV miniseries \"North and South.\"",
    "A complex film about the minefield of loyalty and betrayal.",
    "An anti-war spectacle that uses the story of brothers divided by the 1950 civil war as a metaphor for the wounds of the split.",
    "Always entertains, just like ''Pearl Harbor'' and the rest of the best of Hollywood's dumb war movies.",
    "While it comes on like a flag-waver, it actually delivers something more nuanced. Its underlying skepticism about the Korean War seems to have jibed with the current national mood: The picture was, deservedly, a huge hit.",
    "With killing as an end in itself, combatants lose sight of what they were supposed to be taking up arms for in the first place. It's a terrible lesson, and one that Tae Guk Gi teaches with unexpected confidence.",
    "The cloying score aside, this is a searing depiction of war in all its savagery, waste, and folly, with artfully choreographed sequences that surpass the conventions of the genre.",
    "You may find some of the story developments melodramatic -- I did -- but the film itself is quite powerful.",
    "Shamelessly contrived and manipulative, Tae Guk Gi packs a visceral wallop.",
    "It's hard to remain unmoved by Kang's deeply heartfelt homage to his nation's past.",
    "The film is never as powerful or convincing as it should be.",
    "In the rare moments when a rifle, grenade, howitzer, bayonet, dagger, fist, land mine, or flamethrower isn't being deployed, the film pushes its melodramatic plotline with soap operatic shamelessness.",
    "Far more ambivalent and ambiguous film than Mr. Spielberg's. Both North and South are portrayed as brutal, abusive regimes that use their citizens as so much cannon fodder.",
    "It's easy to view the story of these brothers as a larger metaphor for the relationship between the two Koreas, which gives the film an added resonance that your typical Hollywood war movie wouldn't possess.",
    "Kang remains a superb technician, but somewhere the movie forgot to pack any genuine emotion along with its ordnance and K rations.",
    "After a sentimental opening sequence, he (Kang) scarcely lets the film pause to breathe, which dulls its effectiveness.",
    "Almost entirely devoted to combat violence and sentimental interludes."

The realist antagonising of both the North and South is enough to satisfy any impartial historian, the battle scenes are on par with famous Western staples like Saving Private Ryan (if not even better), and the story of the brotherhood woven into the plot is heart-wrenching - I couldn't see a dry eye in the cinema when I watched this movie as a kid. Now, having reached a more mature age, I now shed tears every time I watch this. It does more than just focus on the gore and tactics and indiscriminate killing that so many modern war films focus on, and it portrays a link to the family stronger than what I think was in Private Ryan (\"Your brothers are dead\" isn't exactly the most touching way to put something like that). But it's not unrealistic about it either (a.k.a. not as unrealistic as all the dramas that the Koreans make nowadays), and it would make even the most warmongering person want to call it quits with North Korea and just look for any peaceful solution to bring this war and any other war to an end.",
