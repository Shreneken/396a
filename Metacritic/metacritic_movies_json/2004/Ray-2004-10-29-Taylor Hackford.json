  "critic_reviews": [
    "A fit tribute to an entertainer who, no matter what hate or hardship threw in his way or how many mistakes he made, we can't stop loving.",
    "An extraordinary piece of biography.",
    "The movie would be worth seeing simply for the sound of the music and the sight of Jamie Foxx performing it. That it looks deeper and gives us a sense of the man himself is what makes it special.",
    "What Ray does right, combined with its generosity of spirit, makes it the most satisfying American movie of the year.",
    "As a musical biography, Ray is driven by the primal excitement of rock-and-soul at the moment of its discovery.",
    "If there were an Oscar for ensemble acting, Ray would win in a stroll.",
    "Jamie Foxx gets so far inside the man and his music that he and Ray Charles seem to breathe as one.",
    "Brilliantly embodied by Jamie Foxx in this unflinching, entertaining biography.",
    "Ray could not have been made without star Jamie Foxx.",
    "Contains large helpings of Hollywood schmaltz, stereotype and clich‚, but it's also pretty impossible to resist.",
    "Every once in a while, a performance pops out of a Hollywood movie that is so brilliant and unique to the matching of actor to role that it's impossible to imagine anyone else achieving it.",
    "A frequently transporting depiction of the early and middle life of Ray Charles, the film soars on remarkable performances, a convincing sense of time and place, and, of course, the glorious music for which Charles was rightly billed as The Genius.",
    "Bursting at the seams with music, Taylor Hackford's ambitious film provides a good sense of the pioneering entertainer's extraordinary journey and brings it to life with plenty of colorful detail.",
    "There may not be a bigger-hearted performance this year than Jamie Foxx's in Ray.",
    "Vibrantly intelligent and tough-minded bio-pic.",
    "Falling on the meaty, potential role of a lifetime like a ravenous lion, erstwhile comedian Jamie Foxx, so good in \"Collateral,\" is just wonderful as the eponymous star.",
    "Delivers platinum performances, especially Sharon Warren as Ray's tough-lovin' mother, Kerry Washington as his lily-tempered wife, and Regina King as his spitfire mistress.",
    "It's conventional in approach and sometimes sentimental, even corny, in its content. But there were so many fascinating overtones in Mr. Charles's life and career that any account of them is bound to be riveting at least part of the time.",
    "If Ray fails to present a genuine portrait of a complex man's essence, it does leave you with an even greater sense of awe for Charles' accomplishments, both in his personal and public lives.",
    "Foxx's complex performance and the filmmaker's willingness to look at the dark side place Ray safely out of the realm of typical Hollywood hagiography.",
    "While not a great movie, is a very good movie about greatness, in which celebrating the achievement of one major artist becomes the occasion for the emergence of another.",
    "Ray may be too by the numbers, but with Jamie Foxx out front, this is one film that knows how to make it all add up.",
    "It is to the film's credit -- and Foxx's -- that we are able to see, behind the flash and fury, a man who didn't know how to love, and was so much the lonelier for it.",
    "No matter the movie's pitfalls, Ray, we can't stop loving you.",
    "It's a shame about Ray, because Foxx is trapped in a movie that takes the music icon's unique story and turns it into cheesy, sentimental American Dream cliches.",
    "Ray rambles on for two hours and 40 minutes, mining repetitive episodes like a TV miniseries.",
    "He (Ray) was, a more complicated man than this film, or perhaps any film, dares allow. Foxx is not at fault here.",
    "It's a shame his (Foxx) performance isn't surrounded by a better film.",
    "Unlike his songs, the film holds something back. It goes deep into a life filled with as much trouble and pain as triumph and accomplishment but never quite gets at the root of who Ray is.",
    "Sure, it’s the Jamie Foxx breakout role. But the movie around it is so systematically “inspirational” that it comes perilously close to sabotaging the breakout.",
    "Foxx is the one standout in an otherwise overcrowded film.",
    "The heart of Ray, of course, is the music and, whatever other shortcomings the film may have, it does not fall short as a showcase for the artist's greatest hits.",
    "Sluggish, conventional, and almost completely lacking in energy.",
    "Hackford's movie falls into a meandering saunter. As the music grows dull, so does the movie.",
    "As Ray nears its abrupt ending, it veers into camp silliness, complete with a psychedelic freak-out withdrawal sequence straight out of a Roger Corman LSD epic.",
    "Were it not for the performance of Foxx, the movie, which touches every base and slows to a crawl near home plate, would sink even when the score soars.",
    "Differs from other authorized Hollywood musical biopics in one striking detail: its subject, still alive when most of this was made, is almost never shown as a likable person.",
    "For too many minutes of its two and a half hours, Ray flips through its cinematic pages with a breathless and-then-this-happened urgency, offering up little in the way of personality (or truth) beyond Jamie Foxx's strong performance."

I'm still pretty amazed, nearly a decade after this movie came out, how few people seem unperturbed by the degree of bad or over acting in this movie. Literally every single scene in this film has an example of it, and given the talent on call, the blame, as far as I am concerned, falls squarely on the shoulders of writer/director Taylor Hackford. Another issue I have is the editing/pace of dramatic scenes, which I found to be rushed, and therefore ineffectual. Perhaps laughably so. It's just hard to take this movie seriously at all, which is a big problem since it's so long. In it's rush to get to the end, the viewer is hustled along through Mr. Robinson's life like pilgrims through a museum with definite profit targets. Anything worth notice gets rushed, while everything that can be crammed in is. And then, at the end, we get crummy reading scenes that describe the rest of the movie. That's our reward for enduring this mess. More mess. In sum, \"Ray\" is overwrought, over-acted, corny, and too long.",

Jamie Foxx is magnetic as the musical legend and turns in a career-defining performance. Sharon Warren, Kerry Washington, Regina King, and CJ Sanders, are all fantastic as well here, turning in fantastic and authentic performances. Ray is a film packed to the brim with passion and it truly overflows. The music in the film is infectious and fantastically worked into the film and subtle direction from Taylor Hackford really pays off as he allows the music and the actors to really take center stage in this one. Ray also expertly handles balancing Charles' youth, rise to fame, stardom, and struggles, with each carrying the required weight and none of the scenes coming as being filler. Rather, they all presented their own set of positives and really combine to be an entirely moving film. In particular, scenes involving Charles as a boy interacting with his mother got to me the most and were some of the best emotional scenes I have seen in a film in a bit. Overall, Ray is a fantastic biopic that manages to avoid feeling like a generic music biopic by being completely authentic and unwilling to compromise our inside look at Charles' life. Thanks to good direction, phenomenal acting, and strong writing, Ray is a winner.",

James L. White's screenplay is smart yet somehow fails to keep the audience engaged into it despite of having some high pitched dramatic sequences. Taylor Hackford has done an amazing work on executing the script and the characters onto the screen and create something colossal out of it with the help of amazing cinematography and fine editing. The performance is where the feature steals the show and the heart of it lies with Jamie Foxx who is supported by a great cast like Karee Washington and Regina King.

But my father was right: when I decided to see this film, and inI've lived all my life listening to my dad saying that Ray Charles was one of the great musicians of the 20th century, and yet I never had the curiosity to listen to his music. But my father was right: when I decided to see this film, and in order to get to know Ray Charles's better, I try to inform myself about the facts of his life and also listen to some recordings. He's a really great musician.I think the film does not require any detailed description about the script, which is provided by director Taylor Hackford. Crossing a good part of the singer's life, we followed his meteoric rise and, also, his most troubled moments in life. The film exaggerates a little in its length, but that will not be a major problem. But the fact is that Ray Charles, despite his genius, was an unpleasant, promiscuous drug addicted person. The film shows that, but softens it a lot. I have no doubt that the real Ray, nowadays, would be arrested for possession of drugs or would face several law suits for sexual harassment. This leads us to one of the problems with this film: that we like Ray enough to care about the character. At times, I felt that he deserved the problems he was going through, and that says a lot about how much I cared about him.Jamie Foxx, however, proved his worth as an actor. Like it or not Ray, he is an excellent actor and was able to perform at the highest level, worthy of the Oscar he came to win. The film also features actresses such as Kerry Washington and Regina King but none of them proved capable of meeting Foxx's overwhelming performance.The film also has excellent production values: we can particularly mention the elegant and careful cinematography, the post-production and editing work very well done and the enormous quality of the soundtrack, where jazz, gospel and, of course, themes abound. , songs from Ray's repertoire. Being a period film, set in the mid-twentieth century, all the sets and costumes were particularly designed to reflect that time and deserve a positive note for their verisimilitude and historical rigour.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nI liked the cinematography used in this movie, it seemed to use some old 1950s footage of New York and LA to give you a good idea of what it was like back then, with the large cars and old buildings, which still has a bit of a modern feel to it and the shots of old, somewhat jazzy bars and clubs that he would perform in. I felt at times as if I wasn't sure what to think of Ray as the character in the movie, I have to say I'm not overly keen on Jamie Foxx as an actor although his portrayal of Ray did seem pretty genuine and well done, portraying a blind person who lives for his music and women and has to deal with regret about something that happened a long time ago but in terms of the character himself, at times you could wonder whether its right to feel sorry for him - sure he doesn't want people to feel sorry for 'the poor old cripple' but seeing his downfall with mistresses and drug use, you could wonder why you should feel much empathy or even interest in what happens to him? surely its obvious that he's going to overdose or disappear into obscurity? (again I'll re-iterate that I wasn't that familiar with his life to really know either way) but there is something about him and especially his poor wife Della that has to deal with his ways and try to confront him about his drug use before the authorities get involved, that keeps you watching to see what if any outcome there is for him. I guess its the usual sort of rock and roll lifestyle story in a sense, of an artist who gets increasingly popular with hit records, earning a good amount of money and getting married, starting a family but as their popularity increases, their personal life gets more complicated and starts going downhill, as is rather the case here.I liked Kerry Washingtons portrayal of his wife Della, I thought Foxx and Washington interacted quite well and you could tell that Della was really quite concerned for Ray and what was happening and watching her trying to keep an eye on what he got up to on the road was quite sad.It was interesting to see how some people reacted to Rays music, the combination of gospel and R&B which was clearly, at the time (the 1950s I believe), quite controversial and indeed a priest enters one of the venues he performs in at one point and insists he stop singing sacreligious songs but when Ray asks the general audience whether they want him to stop or play on, there's a resounding call for him to keep playing.I also liked how Quincy Jones features near the start of the movie, he introduces himself to Ray and this is clearly before he hit the big time, he's in his 20s at this time and it makes you wonder what things must have been like at that time, with what are now such big names in music only just starting out then. It makes you wonder who's not know now that will be huge in the future too, of course!All in all, I thought that while this was rather a long movie and indeed I think the length of the movie had put me off watching it before (its about two hours and 20 minutes long), I'm glad I finally did see it as its a well made movie that its quite obivous has had alot of thought put into it. I do tend to avoid Jamie Foxx movies, he seems such an arrogant actor and tends to play somewhat arrogant roles from the little I know and I feel like I have no interest in such movies but I was curious enough to want to see this, to hear the music and get an idea of what Ray was presumably like and his life story, though I obviously can't vouch for the accuracy of the story but presumably he had a bit of a say in it before it came out, which was coincidentally the same year he sadly passed away, in 2004 I believe. I liked that there was a fair amount of music and fun scenes of his performances and of the crowds reactions to him but there's also a proper story that highlights his different struggles and his background too. The cinematography did seem particularly good, I do like a movie with good shots and there are some particularly good ones here, there's one shot thats shown a few times of coloured bottles tied to a tree from where he lived a a young boy, which seems to be part of a hallucination flashback I think. Anyway I think this movie would look good on a large screen and the soundtrack is good too.",
