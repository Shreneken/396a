  "critic_reviews": [
    "Pixar again hitches top-notch storytelling to the very best in CG animation.",
    "The sleek beauty, crafty wit, family warmth, and impeccable slapstick suffusing The Incredibles immediately vaults it to a new, higher level of entertainment.",
    "As deliriously smart escapist fare, The Incredibles is practically nonpareil.",
    "Dazzlingly beautiful, funny, and meaningful.",
    "The Incredibles creates so seamless a mood of exhilaration that we resent being pulled out of it.",
    "A visually thrilling experience.",
    "A movie with the sweet soul of \"Toy Story\" and the boisterous spirit of \"Spy Kids.\"",
    "Bird has created the unprecedented film that is not just a grand feature-length cartoon but a grand feature, period, a piece of animation that's involving across a spectrum of comedy, action, even drama.",
    "It's easily the best and brightest family-friendly movie of the year.",
    "A spectacularly rendered tale of a family of superheroes, takes the art form to a whole new level.",
    "True-blue Incredibles is a super tribute to the power of family and the might of imagination.",
    "It's hilarious, thrilling and filled with \"life-truth\" -- but it also conceals its effort under a layer of great writing and subtle craftsmanship.",
    "The Incredibles has that rare quality of feeling modern and classic at the same time.",
    "In a movie era when brand names mean very little, it shows once again that Pixar is a stamp of quality.",
    "The Incredibles has those characters, that heart.",
    "The vocal performances are a blast, Hunter's and Lee's in particular. The animation of the villain's tropical isle is stunning.",
    "Yes, yes--The Incredibles is beautiful to look at, but even more lovely beneath the computer-generated surfaces.",
    "For all its wizardry, The Incredibles isn't among my favorite animated movies. Weirdly enough, I think of it, instead, as one of my favorite live-action superhero pictures.",
    "The smart dialogue doesn't hurt, of course, and perhaps the best work is done by Bird himself, who provides the voice of Edna \"E\" Mode, superhero fashion designer.",
    "The movie is full of wonderful little touches: Syndrome, the bad guy, is drawn to remind viewers of \"Heat Miser\" from the classic Christmas cartoon \"The Year Without a Santa Claus.\"",
    "An order-of-magnitude leap forward in animated storytelling.",
    "Delivers the perfect union - a vivid, sublime parody and valentine to the superhero genre.",
    "Bird has crafted a film -- one of the year's best -- that doesn't ring cartoonish, it rings true.",
    "Among the handsome explosions, wacky effects, slapstick comedy and zooming action sequences of The Incredibles, writer-director Brad Bird is attempting to start a revolution.",
    "Clever, buoyant and surprisingly human.",
    "Grown-ups are likely to be surprised by how smart the movie is, and how sneakily perceptive.",
    "Such smart, whiz-bang fun that you may not realize what it's about until you're safely home.",
    "Preaches post-9/11 family values to conservatives while appeasing liberals with ideas of tolerance and social activism.",
    "Isn't just fine family entertainment, it's superior family entertainment.",
    "The action sequences are choreographed with the crackerjack timing expected from Pixar, but the film's funniest and most affecting moments exploit the tension between a special family and a world that insists on dulling them down.",
    "Because it is so visually splendid and ethically serious, the movie raises hopes it cannot quite satisfy. It comes tantalizingly close to greatness, but seems content, in the end, to fight mediocrity to a draw.",
    "Imagine my relief when Bob, Helen, and the kids, for all the nicety of their emotions, turned out to be--if I can risk a word that may be taboo in Pixar land--cartoons. Long may it stay that way.",
    "Sharper and smarter than any animation since \"Shrek 2,\" making it one of the season's supermovies.",
    "One of the year's most clever and visually arresting computer-animated films, enlivened by a well-developed and credible cast of characters who just happen to be superheroes.",
    "The smarter script and stronger range of performances than most high-budget blockbusters clogging theatres these days make you wonder why the live-action feature isn't already obsolete.",
    "The visual and emotional hues are darker [than previous Pixar films], and the focus rests more on middle age than coming of age. The adventures of a family of superheroes are likely to thrill and amuse children, but the film's more grown-up themes might go over their heads.",
    "Unfortunately, the delicious snatches of reflexive wit function as mere intermissions between the distended action sequences and Michael Bay–style megatonnage, which have earned Pixar its first ever PG rating.",
    "The result is truly a family film, not a kiddie time-waster that throws the occasional sop to adults; whether you like or love it is a function of how vividly the material reflects your own childhood fantasies.",
    "The fun hardens into Fun after he's (Mr. Incredible) lured out of retirement and imprisoned in a remote island compound, though the sleek computer animation is spellbinding as usual."

This movie is also really hilarious in a way that can have you connect with the characters. The movie is also quite unpredictable for a movie intended for kids; however, this isn't really a \"kids\" movie. I see many elements in the movie adults would love. The movie also makes a successful attempt at being an uncliche ending for a cliffhanger. This is really bold for a kid's movie, and even for Pixar.

That statement has nothing to do with the film's quality - in fact, The Incredibles is among the best of Pixar's digitally animated movies. However,The Incredibles may become the first Disney/Pixar film not to dominate at the box office. That statement has nothing to do with the film's quality - in fact, The Incredibles is among the best of Pixar's digitally animated movies. However, it's going up against The Polar Express, which has a number of advantages, not the least of which are its built-in audience and seasonal appeal. More than anything else, The Incredibles is likely to be a victim of bad timing. Don't shed any tears for its makers, however. The film will still keep the cash registers ringing until it attains \"blockbuster\" status, although it won't be the runaway hit that Pixar's last production, Finding Nemo, was.\r As the crop of digitally animated films becomes more abundant, audiences are likely to demand increasingly more from such movies. The early efforts mostly had everything: beautiful visuals, great voice acting, and superior writing. But, as more of these pictures reach screens and they become \"routine,\" it's natural to speculate whether there will be a slip in quality. Fortunately, such a trend (if it ever develops) is not in evidence in The Incredibles. As with Toy Story and Finding Nemo, Pixar has again struck gold. The Incredibles isn't just fine family entertainment, it's superior family entertainment.\r One thing immediately noticeable about this picture is that it is markedly more mature in tone and approach than any previous digitally animated movie (excepting Final Fantasy, which was intended for - and did not reach - an entirely different audience). That's not to say that kids, even young ones, won't enjoy The Incredibles, but it appears that writer/director Brad Bird composed his film with older children and their parents in mind. Also, because of the long running time (nearly two hours), boys and girls prone to restlessness may have trouble sitting through everything.\r With its amazing variety of locations (the streets of a city, under the sea, a tropical island, etc.), The Incredibles may be the most visually daunting animated film to reach the screen to-date. And it's close to flawless. Only the people are rendered more like cartoons than reality, and that's a conscious decision. (If you want to see almost-real humans, The Polar Express is the closest you're likely to get at this time.) Digital animation has become so commonplace that we take its detail for granted, but a little consideration of the needed effort will result in a reaction not far removed from awe.\r Although The Incredibles has plenty of action (including chases and battle scenes), its strength is that it makes the characters and their relationships more important than the fights and pyrotechnics. This is a close family - they just happen to possess some rather unusual abilities. Think Spy Kids, only animated. Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl are still in love, even after 15 years of marriage (although she has adjusted better than him to domestic life). The children have believable love/hate relationships with their parents. Dash is willful and disobedient because he's bored - he wants to use his super-speed to excel in sports. And Violet has entered that gawky stage of life when her body becomes uncomfortable to inhabit. She uses her invisibility to spy on a boy she likes without being seen.\r The film's director is Brad Bird, who fashioned the uncommon The Iron Giant, a traditionally animated effort that has developed a large following amongst adults. For his latest outing, Bird keeps the same audience in mind. Where some animated movies attract adults using pop references and sly one-liners, Bird keeps older viewers interested by not dumbing down his screenplay. It's inevitable that some of The Incredibles' themes (such as that of a middle-age crisis) will go over the heads of kids, but it won't hurt the experience for them. They'll still thrill to the action scenes and laugh at the jokes. And they'll get the overall message about parents being the most important superheroes. But Bird's approach makes this a richer and more worthwhile experience for the over-18 crowd. No need to don a trenchcoat and sneak into this movie.\r Ever wonder whether retired superheroes are subject to widening midsections and bad backs? Do they have problems with male pattern baldness? Wonder no longer. Those are just a few of the lighter questions that The Incredibles answers. Bird's feature is appropriately titled - it describes how most viewers will react to this exemplary mixture of top-notch storytelling, visual razzle-dazzle, accessible humor, and involving action. The Incredibles is without question one of 2004's most accomplished and enjoyable family-oriented films.",

Debuting helmer David Valero invites himself and his camera into the lives of three very different protags,Built on the hackneyed premise that people in adversity are the true superheroes, “The Incredibles” is itself anything but hackneyed. Debuting helmer David Valero invites himself and his camera into the lives of three very different protags, and the result is a compellingly intimate, wonderfully human docu that swings smoothly from hopeless tragedy to utter hilarity by analyzing lives under stress. The docu’s combination of humor and heartbreak reps a good opportunity for daring fest programmers.\r Recently, Spanish helmers have done good work with the fly-on-the-wall format, perhaps most notably Sandra Sanchez with “Behind the Lights.” Adan Aliaga’s multiple prize-winning 2006 docu “My Grandmother’s House” is clearly one of the inspirations here (Aliaga himself takes an associate producer credit).\r “The Incredibles” shuttles with agility between its stories. Its subjects are Maria Moreno, a spirited 94-year-old who supplies most of the laughs; Joana Martin, a thirtysomething mother of two who has recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer; and Juan Eulalio Lopez, who lost his arm, and subsequently his marriage, in a traffic accident.\r Moreno goes about her daily business, which involves polishing her extensive collection of religious statuettes, bickering with her daughter and delivering some wonderfully surreal dialogue. Lopez records himself on video, as suggested by his psychotherapist, reflecting on how the women he meets tend to reject him because of his missing arm. His story reps a midpoint between the comic/tragic extremes of the others. (Among lots of little human details, the pic unveils the mystery of how a one-armed man cuts his fingernails.)\r Martin is seen having fun with her family, including her long-suffering husband. But the docu spills over into morally awkward voyeurism when she tells her hairstylist that she’d prefer not to watch her hair being shaved off, a process the aud can see. But several later scenes are almost unbearably moving, mostly because Valero respects Martin too much to be sentimental about her.\r The film’s direction developed as shooting progressed, and inevitably, many scenes have the immediacy of homevideo. The pic’s winningly direct air is the result of crafty work by Valero, who has chosen his subjects well and is happy just to let them be themselves, and editor Aurora Sulli, while ensuring that not a single scene overstays its welcome, neatly teases out the counterpoints and echoes among the three stories. When Martin’s doctor tells her it’s important to stay optimistic, Moreno’s irrepressible optimism immediately springs to mind.\r On the downside, the project’s rebranding of its protags as “The Iron Lady,” “Broken Wing,” and “Radioactive Woman,” respectively, feels like a contrived and unnecessary attempt to yoke the stories together after the fact.",

He is also getting married to ElastiGirl. But when  he makes a judgement call by saving a suicidal man, who in turn decides to sue the hero, which sets off a chain of claims and court cases for \"supers\" all over the world, eventually driving them into exile.\rThe film then plays out in an almost sitcom like manner, with many quips of daily life and menial jobs, with Mr Incredible now under his real name of Bob Parr, working for an insurance company, bored with his routine life away from saving the world.But when he is set up to be the face of an unknown corporation which needs heroes, he soon suspects that something larger is afoot, but he must also tread carefully as he has yet to tell his wife of his activities.\rThe Incredibles combines the perfect blend of storytelling with plenty of animated action, but also throwing in a large message in the importance of family values and never to forget the past, as you will indeed be condemned to repeat, embrace and cherish those moments in your life which perhaps won't happen again.\rNot only is this one of the best Pixar films to date, but could very well be one of the best superhero films to come around, live-action or animated, it simply doesn't matter, director Brad Bird has managed to find balance to how the modernisation of our current world can impact such events and phenomenons such as those with superpowers.\rThere is a perfect voice cast to push along this excellent film including Craig T. Nelson, Jason Lee, Holly Hunter and even Samuel L. Jackson, all separate characters with very different agendas, Mr Incredible would truly do anything for a trip back to the good old days, while his wife ElastiGirl may be content with normal life, but is more concerned about the well-being of her children.\rThere is also excellent comedy to be had, with hilarious characters in the form of Edna Mode, the heroes costume designer, and a little kid who sits outside waiting for something amazing to happen.\rIt truly adds up to a unique and brilliant take on being accepted in an unfamiliar society, which equals to a riveting and glorious film.",

Animation has gone far beyond flick-books and rotoscope and, with every film, Pixar ups the power of the pixel. The IncrediblesOne of The Incredibles'credits reads Hair And Cloth Supervisor. Someone else was in charge of Water and Weather. Animation has gone far beyond flick-books and rotoscope and, with every film, Pixar ups the power of the pixel. The Incredibles IS funny, charming and smart, but principally it's a technical wonder. There's a sense that those armies of texture-buffers, hair-strand sculptors and water-wobblers were given the shiny, gold-plated office, while the script and story guys had to make do with the broom cupboard.\r The set-up is glorious: a batch of scratchy vox-pops of our heroes in their heyday. Mr Incredible (Nelson) is the self-imposed power-patriarch, a pumped and chiselled all-American do-gooder - Captain America with an Arnie twist. Then there's Frozone (Samuel L Jackson), a sleek and, literally, supercool über-dude, zapping out and speed-surfing waves of instant ice. Flying is so last century. Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) is made of softer stuff: infinitely stretchy, Mr Tickle arms and bendy, extendy legs. Tackles tall buildings with a single step.\r Skip forward a few years and Mr Incredible is domesticated, forced out of super-service after a series of lawsuits from those reluctantly rescued. Elastigirl is the mother to his kids and all are forced to suppress their own superpowers. Daughter Violet (Sarah Vowell) has invisibility skills, while son Dash (Spencer Fox) is in trouble for using his speed at school. Like his dad, he feels punished for being too good. \"Everyone's special,\" Elastigirl tells Dash, who shoots back, \"Which is another way of saying no one is.\"\r This isn't the first time Pixar have sought out a Simpsons influence (series producer David Silverman co-directed Monsters, Inc), but ex-exec Brad Bird shouts his credentials more loudly. The sequence where a work-ragged Bob crumples the rim of his car door in anger and then repeatedly slams it - shattering the glass and steaming himself up even more - is pure Homer.\r There's also plenty of Simpsons style in the sophistication simmering beneath the main action: sly sight-gags (Mr Incredible's anxious ecstasy as a battering from a giant robot becomes a kind of chiropractory); a railyard work-out that gives new meaning to `training'; sitcom-style domestic bickering (the way Elastigirl knows Incredible has been illicitly super-heroing when she finds \"rubble\" on his collar). And there's a delightful running gag involving the health-and-safety issues around billowing superhero capes (\"Look what happened to Stratogirl - sucked into a jet engine!\").\r But, given Pixar's peerless standards, The Incredibles doesn't quite live up to its name. The signature pre-feature short is their weakest yet: a hokey little vignette on lamb-shearing season, which seems mostly designed to show off the new texture software. The tone is pretty uneven, too, with a talky, more Simpsons-satirical opening half-hour suddenly swept aside in a barrage of breathless set-pieces, with only the final 20 minutes effectively mixing both.\r And while most of the gags have that familiar Pixar glimmer, some of the references feel a little jaded: the Bondish bad guy Syndrome (Jason Lee) living under a volcano; a face-off between Mr Incredible and his nemesis that lazily recalls Buzz's infiltration of Zurg's lair in Toy Story 2. What's more, comics doyen Alan Moore must be eyeing his lawyer's number over the Watchmen-esque, decommissioned superheroes concept. Still, Bird's script is extremely sharp and the use of relatively low-profile voice talent pays off in a non-jarring ensemble effect, with Samuel L Jackson's Frozone wisely not overused.\r More of Bird's Simpsons class plays out in the strong secondary characters. Bob Incredible's boss is a chimpy, hot-headed little nebbish of a middle-manager, while costume designer Edna (voiced by Bird himself) is an instant cult-heroine classic - a pixieish parody of a Euro-fashionista, all frosty glare and clipped, Greta Garbo twang.\r But the Pixar-standard, strong, buddyish relationship at the centre has been bypassed. Mr Incredible and Elastigirl are likeable, but they're no match for Mike and Sulley, Buzz and Woody or Marlin and Dory.\r When Pixar channel the technical flair into their true strength (attention to detail) the results are immaculate: the watery greys of Bob's office drudgery; nemesis Syndrome's micro-modelled tics and tantrums; his gormless goons' gyroscopic flying saucers; the shifting, squishy musculature that gives the characters' weight and presence. Every single scene - every frame - is dripping with exceptional depth and craft, while the comic timing is still as fresh and finely honed as ever. No one else can deliver a bubble-gum burst gag with just the right level of pre-pop delay.\r Slight on story and soul but strong on style and humour, The Incredibles impresses even if it's not quite Pixar perfect. Most will find it superduper.",

Animation has gone far beyond flick-books and rotoscope and, with every film, Pixar ups the power of the pixel. The IncrediblesOne of The Incredibles'credits reads Hair And Cloth Supervisor. Someone else was in charge of Water and Weather. Animation has gone far beyond flick-books and rotoscope and, with every film, Pixar ups the power of the pixel. The Incredibles IS funny, charming and smart, but principally it's a technical wonder. There's a sense that those armies of texture-buffers, hair-strand sculptors and water-wobblers were given the shiny, gold-plated office, while the script and story guys had to make do with the broom cupboard.\r The set-up is glorious: a batch of scratchy vox-pops of our heroes in their heyday. Mr Incredible (Nelson) is the self-imposed power-patriarch, a pumped and chiselled all-American do-gooder - Captain America with an Arnie twist. Then there's Frozone (Samuel L Jackson), a sleek and, literally, supercool über-dude, zapping out and speed-surfing waves of instant ice. Flying is so last century. Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) is made of softer stuff: infinitely stretchy, Mr Tickle arms and bendy, extendy legs. Tackles tall buildings with a single step.\r Skip forward a few years and Mr Incredible is domesticated, forced out of super-service after a series of lawsuits from those reluctantly rescued. Elastigirl is the mother to his kids and all are forced to suppress their own superpowers. Daughter Violet (Sarah Vowell) has invisibility skills, while son Dash (Spencer Fox) is in trouble for using his speed at school. Like his dad, he feels punished for being too good. \"Everyone's special,\" Elastigirl tells Dash, who shoots back, \"Which is another way of saying no one is.\"\r This isn't the first time Pixar have sought out a Simpsons influence (series producer David Silverman co-directed Monsters, Inc), but ex-exec Brad Bird shouts his credentials more loudly. The sequence where a work-ragged Bob crumples the rim of his car door in anger and then repeatedly slams it - shattering the glass and steaming himself up even more - is pure Homer.\r There's also plenty of Simpsons style in the sophistication simmering beneath the main action: sly sight-gags (Mr Incredible's anxious ecstasy as a battering from a giant robot becomes a kind of chiropractory); a railyard work-out that gives new meaning to `training'; sitcom-style domestic bickering (the way Elastigirl knows Incredible has been illicitly super-heroing when she finds \"rubble\" on his collar). And there's a delightful running gag involving the health-and-safety issues around billowing superhero capes (\"Look what happened to Stratogirl - sucked into a jet engine!\").\r But, given Pixar's peerless standards, The Incredibles doesn't quite live up to its name. The signature pre-feature short is their weakest yet: a hokey little vignette on lamb-shearing season, which seems mostly designed to show off the new texture software. The tone is pretty uneven, too, with a talky, more Simpsons-satirical opening half-hour suddenly swept aside in a barrage of breathless set-pieces, with only the final 20 minutes effectively mixing both.\r And while most of the gags have that familiar Pixar glimmer, some of the references feel a little jaded: the Bondish bad guy Syndrome (Jason Lee) living under a volcano; a face-off between Mr Incredible and his nemesis that lazily recalls Buzz's infiltration of Zurg's lair in Toy Story 2. What's more, comics doyen Alan Moore must be eyeing his lawyer's number over the Watchmen-esque, decommissioned superheroes concept. Still, Bird's script is extremely sharp and the use of relatively low-profile voice talent pays off in a non-jarring ensemble effect, with Samuel L Jackson's Frozone wisely not overused.\r More of Bird's Simpsons class plays out in the strong secondary characters. Bob Incredible's boss is a chimpy, hot-headed little nebbish of a middle-manager, while costume designer Edna (voiced by Bird himself) is an instant cult-heroine classic - a pixieish parody of a Euro-fashionista, all frosty glare and clipped, Greta Garbo twang.\r But the Pixar-standard, strong, buddyish relationship at the centre has been bypassed. Mr Incredible and Elastigirl are likeable, but they're no match for Mike and Sulley, Buzz and Woody or Marlin and Dory.\r When Pixar channel the technical flair into their true strength (attention to detail) the results are immaculate: the watery greys of Bob's office drudgery; nemesis Syndrome's micro-modelled tics and tantrums; his gormless goons' gyroscopic flying saucers; the shifting, squishy musculature that gives the characters' weight and presence. Every single scene - every frame - is dripping with exceptional depth and craft, while the comic timing is still as fresh and finely honed as ever. No one else can deliver a bubble-gum burst gag with just the right level of pre-pop delay.\r Slight on story and soul but strong on style and humour, The Incredibles impresses even if it's not quite Pixar perfect. Most will find it superduper.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThe Incredibles, a gift box of everyday superhero action. Packed with the all-so-relatable suburban family, your favorite superhero tales, and tied together with comedy that may or may not be the cause of Pixar’s first ever PG film. I’ll tell you right now, this present is not one you’ll be returning like that weird sweater Auntie Jane bought you. This movie is a top of the notch faux leather coat with built in bluetooth speakers and rhinestones.\r Although I have seen The Incredibles over a hundred times, there won’t ever be a day that I wouldn’t be willing to sit down with a cup of cocoa and watch it again. It’s one of those movies that I never seem to get tired of, which I’m telling you right now is quite hard to come across. I find myself laughing at jokes that I’ve heard multiple times, and I would be lying if I said I didn’t hear my parents laughing too. The characters are so easy to relate to, as Pixar really captured the modern day family, with a twist of course. Every jump scare seems to startle me all over again and every single time I watch it, iIt feels like the first.\r The movie instantly grasps your attention with the introduction of three average superheros and a car chase scene that could definitely be another element to that “parental guidance” suggestion in the opening. Just after the first 10 minutes, the movie seems predictable, superheroes, bad guys, fighting crime, blah blah blah. I’ve seen it all before. But that’s where people are wrong. Law suits against superheroes? That’s new. Then a ban on them, forcing these crime fighting mutant humans into hiding. How will these daring do’s live in the real world having to keep their powers secret? It’s a new twist on the superhero tales we are used to and that’s where the story takes place.\r 15 years later. Bob Parr is an average looking, middle aged, guy, living in the suburbs with his wife, Helen, and three kids, teenage Violet, middle schooler, Dash, and baby Jack Jack. He works at an insurance agency and deals with that annoying boss we’ll all probably come across some day. They are definitely a typical, or should I say, stereotypical, family. Little do others know that Bob and Helen are actually the city famous Mr.Incredible, a hero known for his super strength, and Elastigirl, a woman who, as her name suggests, is elastic, and can stretch her limbs dangerously far.\r And I guess the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree because the three baby incredibles were so lucky as to gain powers themselves. Violet, holding the ability to turn invisible and create force fields, really shows her personality with her powers, as she is very shy and tends to keep to herself. Dash, unironically named for his super speed that gives him the ability to run on water and pull pranks on his teacher without being seen. And little Jack Jack, whose powers haven’t seemed to bloom yet, or so we think.\rAlthough these supers are in hiding, Bob just can’t seem to let go of the past, sneaking out at night with his old friend, Lucius, or Frozone, another superhero, and a good source of laughs, who holds the power to freeze, listening to the police scanners and catching robbers or saving people from burning buildings. All of a sudden, Bob’s life takes a turn for the better, when he is contacted by a secret government agency to help them destroy an out of control robot. Of course, I don’t want to go into too much detail as to spoil the ending, but all I can say is the movie is definitely full of twists and turns that leave you on the edge if your seat (just be careful not to fall off when laughing).\r All in all this movie is not just for kids, as the cartoon from Pixar suggests. I think anyone from any age group would definitely find someway to connect to it’s everyday characters. The humor spans up to adults also, as Pixar is very good at hiding little things for the adults to enjoy. This movie is so much more unique than the superhero movies we are used to today and it is all around one of Pixar’s best.",

During the time of the heroes, a really strong man named Mr. Incredible and a Elastic Woman get into a relationship and got married, years after the end of the age of the heroes they got children and really tried to live like a normal person with normal jobs. Trying to keep being a heroe secretly and don't getting used to the normal life, the main character cedes in the first attempt to the action.The story of this movie is very good, it is very well constructed without plot holes, it does have a nice use of the chekhov gun. A very nice narrative, with suspect aspects, a kind of narrative that one person is lying to the other and you have the perspective of the liar at first, and later on they give you the perspective of the other, making you understand both point of views very well. The motivation of all the characters are very well, not just exposed, but in some cases you can really feel it, feel the problem and the bad situation that the character is in and what i'm referring about, it isn't much about the acting, but the context of the thing, the moment that mr. incredible is in that monotonous work, you feel his unhappiness and later on when he got to be a hero again, it's easily noticiable the wight out of his shoulders of doing something that he really loves again, and that make us go to another really nice thing of the movie, the metaphor with the reality. One of the best things about this kind of movie, is that it works for all publics, the kids will have fun with the action, but the adults will also see the reality and heavy message that there is in it where you can put in relation with your life and make a parallel, that if you got something that you love to do, and for some reason ends in a job that you hate, you will not just struggle with your life, but also with your familly, because you will possibli get to be always stressed and tired, when right at your side there is something that you really like and can make things work. The problem with their familly was, they didn't talked, wich is the problem with most of the families, what can make they understand eachother and accept.The strutcture of this movie is different than the main structure that pixar movies had at that time, is not about going back at home, that story that the character lose himself and needs to get back home, this one is more about understanding home, get to know the other in your side.The action of this movie is incredible, the best thing about the action in those teams of superheroes is when they work together and use their powers together to achieve or reach something, and that in this movie is perfect, not just how they introduce the powers to the public, but also the interaçao between them using it, it isn't just funny, but also dope as hell when they are all in action.The cinematography of this movie is very good as well, it does have some really pretty moments, but it isn't fantastic and helps to tell the story in a lot of moments, but it is pretty, it does have a moving camera that really captivates me, during in action it is really a differential.The villain of the movie is nice and it does have a ok motivation that inside of the movie it does make some sense, but you will need to have some disbelief to buy what happens during some moments, there is some poetic license here, i didn't liked the villain that much, but he makes sense. The movie isn't about him, but the familly.The theme that they created here is just remarkable, it is great, a noir theme very investigative.All the characters are wondrously constructed, you not just care, but you is really interested to know more and go along with all of them, all had a key moment, and all are explored in different ways, they are uniques. Not just them but the familly friend with ice power and the comic moments is dope as well.They make fun and use the superheroes stereotype here a lot, it isn't just a homage, but a characterization of the superheroe theme, the makers really had a nice brainstorm of the hero type while doing this.This movie is just great, it does have a nice meaning, great action moments, characters that you will like very quicly and a great story about familly.",

After the Superheroes are deemed illegal, Bob(Mr.Incredible)is approached by an organization who promises him the chance to continue using his powers for the greater good. This leads to one of my personal favorite twists in film, the revelation that Mr.Incredible isn't working for an organization trying to help out supers. But in fact, being conned by one of his greatest fans from the Glory Days turned enemy who is seeking revenge on the heroic crusader.Because of the way the story is executed, which puts Mr.Incredible in the spotlight. Some of the the other family members and characters are left a little under developed but still have moments to shine.The Animation in this film is astonishing for its time. Most of it still holds up today, except for few smalls details.The voice cast in this film is also really great and you can really hear and feel the characters emote.Overall, I really enjoyed The Incredibles. it proves to be my favorite Pixar film and one of the greatest animated movies ever made(hence, it winning several awards). It is also a great superhero movie and completes a very difficult task in my book, which is creating original superheroes and villains. The Incredibles is the greatest Fantastic Four film never made.",

It's almostFirst of all I need to say that this was snubbed for a best picture nomination in 2004. I haven't seen The Aviator or Sideways but I actually thought this was better than Million Dollar Baby and the best movie I've seen from 2004. It's almost perfect in terms of kids movies. Its animation,  storytelling, character originality and humor is so satisfying that I could watch this movie once a week and never get tired of it",

This is partly because this movie is superbly crafted in all ways, and partly because it speaks to me so strongly on a personal level.\r You see, *I am Mr. Incredible!*\r This cartoon character captures ME so perfectly it's uncanny! He is everything I am, both for better and worse - he has exactly the same strengths and weaknesses of character, and he suffers exactly the same dilemmas and life challenges. If someone ever cared enough about my little existence to make a cartoon caricature of me, Mr. Incredible is precisely what they'd come up with. How could I not absolutely love him! :-)\r I understand this personal reason to adore this movie is irrelevant to YOU, dear reader, because you're most likely not a real life Mr. Incredible. So you'll just have to enjoy this movie for being a superbly crafted piece of entertainment that makes you proud to be a human being, just because human beings could make such an awesome movie. That will have to suffice for you poor scrubs who didn't get portrayed with a lead role in the movie!\r But it should still deserve at the very least a strong 9, if you have a single sensible bone in your body.",
