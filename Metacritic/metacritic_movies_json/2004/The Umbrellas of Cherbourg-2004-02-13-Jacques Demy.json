  "critic_reviews": [
    "A heartfelt, passionate, tragic musical suite made up of these formulas, which the film both celebrates and wryly examines to discover their inner logic: how they actually work, what they do and don't do.",
    "Demy, his cinematographer Jean Rabier and production designer Bernard Evein created an operatic masterpiece of romanticism, which makes a modest but effective antidote to the harsh era of cynicism that has pervaded world cinema ever since.",
    "A glorious romantic confection unlike any other in movie history.",
    "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg has stood the test of time as beautifully as Deneuve and seems likely to enchant future generations as fully as it has audiences over the past four decades.",
    "A surprisingly effective film, touching and knowing and, like Deneuve, ageless.",
    "Although most movies favor passion and true love, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg shows that another less demanding, more subtle kind of love has its own appeal.",
    "The wonderful-terrible dervish of Umbrellas reaches peak abandon, worthy of Vincente Minnelli, when Geneviève sobs out a plaint for Guy as a carnival whirls outside the shop.",
    "By inflating the life of a common shop girl into a musical spectacle, Demy succeeds in turning a tedious existence into a fantasy, yet he and cinematographer Jean Rabier and art director Bernard Evein do so without creating a false world.  [review of original release]",
    "It takes nerve to make a pic in which all dialog is sung. Also, there is no dancing and this is not a filmed operetta or opera.  [review of original release]"

      "content": "Upon hearing comparisons between the works of Jacques Demy and Damien Chazelle's forthcoming musical La La Land, I knew I had to watch some of Demy's work in anticipation of that film. My first - The Umbrellas of Cherbourg - certainly matchedUpon hearing comparisons between the works of Jacques Demy and Damien Chazelle's forthcoming musical La La Land, I knew I had to watch some of Demy's work in anticipation of that film. My first - The Umbrellas of Cherbourg - certainly matched and exceeded my expectations. A musical about life, love, and loss, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a beautifully written film that is imperfect, but gorgeously crafted. Operatic in style, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg features no grand set pieces nor any single song. Rather, it is written as a typical film would be, except it is sung. The end result is a beautifully written film that may lack true character development, but its music is so brilliantly put together, it is easy to turn a blind eye to its flaws.\r Telling the story of Genevieve (Catherine Deneuve) and her relationship with Guy (Nino Castelnuevo), a man who is set to leave for war in Algeria, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg shows both the dark and light side of love and marriage. Demy's film does not shy away from showing the pain it can cause and the torment it leaves Genevieve with when Guy leaves for war, but the film equally shows the ecstasy and joy. The end result is a sweet film that feels endlessly watchable and thoroughly enjoyable. Though not truly dreamlike - like La La Land has been described - The Umbrellas of Cherbourg does have a certain airy and light feeling to it. This is matched by the largely bright color scheme of the film, which has the impact of making the film feel truly vibrant. This vibrancy is matched the sung dialogue. Had this been a spoken film, it would have lost much of its impact. As it stands, the singing bolsters the beauty of the rest of the film and breathes life into it as a whole.\r However, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is far from perfect. Though beautifully sung and brilliantly acted - especially by Deneuve - the film's characters leave much to be desired. By the end, it feels as though things speed along too quickly in the story and things just happen. This leaves many dramatic sequences feeling quite hollow and emotionless for the audience, as they are far too sudden to have a true impact. Yet, individually, its characters are terrific. Well-written and able to communicate often without speaking, the film's characters seem incredibly real and authentic both in 1960s France and the modern world.\r Musically, the film is great. All of the actors complete their singing lines terrifically and the score - which is a constant in the background - is fantastic. The music certainly, as mentioned before, contributes to this light, airy, and warm feeling the film radiates. Though the plot can often depict somewhat traumatic experiences for the characters, the film never ceases to be a pleasing and comfortable experience. This is, in large part, thanks to the music that provides a degree of pleasure that escapes explanation.\r As a whole, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg - the first film I have seen by Demy - is a tremendous experience. A romantic musical, the film depicts both the good and the bad side of love with equal passion. The music and the signing are tremendous and wind up covering up the main negative of the film, which is the far-too-quick pacing of the story towards the end of the film that removes much of the emotional impact it could have.",

Infused byI've been meaning to dive into Demy's filmography since hearing he had a huge impact on Chazelle's La La Land, with this one being singled out as the primary influence, that's not to mention it's often cited as Demy's chef-d'œuvre. Infused by jazz melodies as well as thumping percussion for an added flair, featuring eye-candy pastel-coloured set and costume design on full display, and cycling through seasons in a way thematically suggestive, Chazelle's musical is definitely not far removed from this one although each has its own approach to its distinct story. What grabbed my attention the most is how Demy progressively jettisons the fantastical, iridescent world in favour of an otherwise grounded one. From the opening sequence of an aerial view of raindrops pitter-pattering on cobble stones and the titular umbrellas, to the bold, bright colours, to the constant singing, Demy muster all technical tools, congregating to lend a lulling effect that sent me into a delightful stupor, and to kaleidoscopically play up the emotional union and jovial state of Geneviève and Guy who're enamored with each other.Cherbourg is almost presented in pink, before giving to brown-ish and blue hues to emote Geneviève's feelings of forlorn and sadness respectively, and fuchsia and red to suggest warning and uncertainty, when Guy leaves to Algeria due to his conscription, leaving Geneviène facing a tough decision that threatens their relationship. Even colours brimming with joy at first, such as yellow, gradually wane and pale, giving way to some of their dull and faint derived shades. All these create melancholic undertones along the way that ground the film in reality while portending its bittersweet ending where there isn't a dry eye to be found. But The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a film of the of vicissitudes of life and how one has to resign to fate so long as latching onto hope becomes more and more difficult, and it's more than just a matter of counting the days.The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is also of teenage love and recklessness, and it's here in particular where it sets itself apart from the rest with its sense of verisimilitude. “People only die of love in movies,” said Geneviène's mother who neither believes in love at a young age nor love at first sight. She's pragmatic and even cynical, and maybe that's her main impetus for wanting her daughter to get married to the wealthy jewellery merchant. Yet, her happiness at seeing her blear-eyed daughter a bit cheered up when handed a letter from her lover is real and indicative of a true motherly affection. Make no mistake, this is far from the flawless film I was expecting. The editing is a bit clunky, which shows most in the continuity of music. It also took me a while to adjust to the dialogue, entirely being recited and sung, but soon I started to appreciate the unconventional lyricism of it all. A visual and emotional stunner that's not to be missed by all the fools who dream and lovers of musicals in general.",

The main thing I can say about this film is that it's very colourful, both thematically and literally (there is a lot of vivid imagery in this film). I must admit I don't much care for love triangles most of the time, but the way it's executed in this film is quite compelling. I am in particular quite fond of the ending showing what became of all the characters all those years later. I suspect I will be rewatching this one eventually, and perhaps sooner rather than later. Oh yeah, and if you were wondering, the music is great.",
