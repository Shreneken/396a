  "critic_reviews": [
    "A dramatic triumph.",
    "In the way that water can heal and harm, this film balances moments of dreamy spirituality with the salty harshness of family disputes.",
    "A monumentally moving experience, from the powerful acting by Javier Bardem to the evocative music, composed by the director, Alejandro Amenábar.",
    "Based on a true story, the movie has abundant humor and uplift - but it's a heartbreaker of extraordinary dimension.",
    "The Sea Inside brings us outside and inside ourselves, and takes us to brave new aesthetic depths.",
    "The result is a film both poetic and profound.",
    "What makes The Sea Inside such a riveting drama is that none of these relationships is sufficient to make Ramón want to go on living.",
    "Bardem's performance is a marvel of restraint and control, both physical and emotional.",
    "The Sea Inside is uplifting. This is a movie that may cause viewers to both laugh and cry.",
    "The film is a melancholy but poetic meditation on the fragility of the gift of life.",
    "A film about freedom as well as death, this won't suit every taste, but it rewards close attention and has moments of saving humor.",
    "As for Bardem: How can I do him justice? He is normally the most robustly physical of actors, with a plummy voice and an insolent sensuality. To see him immobile, ashen, his hair gone, de-bodyized: It's agonizing.",
    "Operates as stealth art: stately, moving, beautifully acted, and urgently subversive to our own status quo.",
    "A flawed film worth seeing.",
    "The more intimate scenes are almost unbearably poignant.",
    "Rare is the motion picture which grapples with issues this provocative and profound. Rarer still is one which does so this well.",
    "Bardem is brilliant.",
    "Wrings honest emotion and riveting dramatics from its tale.",
    "It's moving, romantic, dreamlike, flawlessly acted and so engaging as to make you forget about euthanasia before it jolts you back into recognition.",
    "This is simply the story of one man. Yes, and on those terms I accept it, and was moved by the humanity and logic of the character.",
    "For the most part, the film stays steady-on, celebrating one man's crusade - and one family's heartbreak.",
    "The classy production, with its aesthetic graces, is especially convincing about the charisma of the man, a performance specialty of the great Bardem.",
    "The film, quite rightly, is a tour de force for Bardem.",
    "This movie might make you cry, but it is not explicitly designed to do so.",
    "Fortunately, Bardem, who earned an Oscar nomination for his role in Julian Schnabel's \"Before Night Falls,\" makes up for the script's shortcomings.",
    "Unfortunately, Bardem is confined by more than Ramón's paralysis. He also must work within the limits of a partially numbed script.",
    "The result isn't an easy film, but it is rewarding.",
    "There's a combination of fatalism and hard-edged humor at work in The Sea Inside that you can imagine Irish writers would feel right at home with.",
    "It's a testament to his (Amenabar's)  cinematic flair that he has taken as daunting a subject as euthanasia and turned it into a crowd-pleasing movie. It's also an indication of what feels wrong here. I can't deny that I was moved, but it all goes down a bit TOO easy.",
    "If the movie is largely familiar, its passion and craft are noteworthy.",
    "Understandably, a filmmaker tackling the retelling of a national hero must do so with great delicacy, but The Sea Inside presents not so much a hero as a saint in Sampredo.",
    "Bardem gives such a brilliant performance in The Sea Inside, it's a crime that the film itself drowns in tears.",
    "Placid and rather attractive on the surface, with depths you can sense but which are never fully plumbed.",
    "When pinned mostly in the man's bedroom, Amenábar's flashier instincts are stifled by a bolted camera and a procession of issue-of-the-week clichés.",
    "The film fails to convey the claustrophobic terror experienced by a man who called his book \"Letters From Hell.\"",
    "You want the movie to stir your soul, push your intellect, or at the very least, break your heart. But it's such a repetitive and thinly constructed piece of filmmaking that the scope and complexity of Sampedro's case are turned to porridge.",
    "I remained strangely dry-eyed up to the final shot."

I'ts not just any story that makes us reflect on the validity of our own lives. And for the construction of the message are added to the powers of the director, actors, soundtrack, assembly and photography. AmenÃ¡bar is an extraordinary filmmaker. He could really force the emotions of those watching through primary devices that Hollywood is still trying to use (and that Spielberg, for example, dominates like nobody). Instead, he lets the emotional potential of the situations portrayed itself excites the viewer, producing true feelings. Much of it by Javier Badem delivers his best performance in his career. In that sense, what won me over was the fact that Ramon, his character was, at least in the film, an amazing person. Their speeches denouncing a tremendous sobriety and a realistic science of what it means dignity. It is impossible not to empathize with the subject. \"The Sea Inside\" is a story truly worthy of being known. If I had the opportunity to speak with Ramon, I'd say, \"Ramon, friend, I support your decision.\"",

Without overridden the complex issues like dwelling on the past and the backstory of the protagonist, it is pretty much what's up front. And dealing it with smart negotiations and impressive tactics, Amenabar keeps the storyline on the edge and the emotions on the surface. And despite of it being dipped entirely into a pathos bubble, it never grows manipulative, it succumbs a bit to express on a large scale similar to its characters, but the message finally reaches adequately to the audience. The fascinating substance in here is not the concept, but where the storyline which drives that little piece of idea.Also, personal story aside, the debate that it ping pongs throughout the movie about the life and death is worth pondering about. Obviously the characters are humble and caring on both the sides but they are also gritty and honest. The conversations are pragmatic and layered monologues echos between those silent pitches. It is a tale that relies a lot upon the performance and the cast is giving their best and are thoroughly convincing. Bardem once again proves that he is the real deal. He chokes up at essential moments whilst breaking down that melts you down.His emotions paints this darker picture into a brighter one with an inspiring tone of fighting back for one more round. The supporting cast too has done a tremendous work on delivering the magnitude of the situation and serve it up front. The dramatic sequences are weaved out to be cinematic where each step of the structure is glorified to keep the audience tangled. The Sea Inside is more of what's inside Bardem's gift basket that he keeps offering, a tremendous work on portraying such a role.",

Evidemment, le film fait débat, que ce soit dans le film ou en dehors de celui-ci, surtout en Espagne, pays très catholique mais aussi chez nous où le droit de mourir dans la dignité est un long chemin de croix...En dépit de ses bonnes intentions, Mar adentro est donc hautement indigeste et d'une pénibilité qui devrait être remboursée par la sécurité sociale.",

The film is strongly based on the life of Ramón Sampedro, a Spanish quadriplegic who defendedI find it difficult to remain indifferent to this film, directed by Alejandro Amenábar, one of the best and most respected Spanish directors today. The film is strongly based on the life of Ramón Sampedro, a Spanish quadriplegic who defended the right to euthanasia and ended up committing suicide, with the support of a friend. It is, therefore, a strongly fractured film, which is hated or adored depending on whether the public defends, or rejects, euthanasia. There is no way to avoid this: the film is not just a biography, it does not adopt a neutral stance... the film defends Sampedro's perspective and the supposed right to die.Personally, I am against euthanasia. Radically. It was a topic debated in my country not long ago, and I was one of many who fought against it, just as I would have done if capital punishment had been discussed, and in the same way as I did before when abortion was debated. As a rule, I do not accept that a man may have the legal right to take another human being's life, even if he asks for it repeatedly (this is what happens in euthanasia, as we assume that they are people who would have already committed suicide if they could do it by their own means). The right to die cannot supersede the moral duty not to kill. It's my opinion. And so, seeing this film shocked me for its militancy in favor of euthanasia. I understand the reasons, but I can't agree.But this only serves to understand why I gave the film such a low rating: it is not because the film is bad, but because it is so militant, like a very expensive piece of propaganda. Bardem's character says that he doesn't feel alive because he is only able to talk and move his head, depending entirely on others. Jean-Dominique Bauby, whose life was also brought to the movies with \"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\", was so paralyzed that he could only blink one eye, and he still managed to write a book! If we stop for a moment and look around, we will see many other cases of people, including anonymous ones, who endure suffering lives the same way, or event worse, than Señor Sampedro, and who manage to be examples of persistence and tenaciousness. Giving up our own life is simply throwing the towel to the ground.Javier Bardem is an excellent actor, and it costs me to see him associated with a film as propagandistic as this one, but I recognize his excellent work and his commitment to the character. It's not just a question of makeup, although that helped... the actor is good, and he's in great shape here. Belén Rueda is also a good addition to the cast and gives us one of the most important jobs of his career so far. There are other good actors, like Clara Segura or Lola Dueñas, but I confess I don't know them that well.Technically, the film has Amenábar's master hand, starting with its careful cinematography and excellent filming work. The light, the use of colors (the highlight is blue and gray tones in some more intimate scenes), the shadows, all helped the director to create an environment conducive to moral, almost philosophical, meditation. The dialogues are important, although Bardem's text contains the most propaganda-laden pieces, some of them authentic monologues. The sets and costumes are good, the choice of filming locations is excellent, the soundtrack is immersive... everything is quite good. It's just a pity to be propaganda.",
