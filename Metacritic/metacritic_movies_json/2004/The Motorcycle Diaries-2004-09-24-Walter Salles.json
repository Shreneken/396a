  "critic_reviews": [
    "Lovely, heartfelt and unforced.",
    "One thing few will disagree on is the quality of the film's acting, especially by Gael García Bernal as Guevara and Rodrigo de la Serna as his friend. Both effortlessly embody the footloose, sometimes feckless quality of this \"On the Road\"-style adventure.",
    "A gorgeous, poetic and stirring epic.",
    "A superb film.",
    "The result is a rare and precious work. The Motorcycle Diaries is an epic road movie with everything you'd want from such a film: laughs, kicks, adventures, pathos, poetry, natural beauty, strange encounters and friendship tested and strengthened.",
    "Mr. Bernal's soulful, magnetic performance notwithstanding, the real star of the film is South America itself, revealed in the cinematographer Eric Gautier's misty green images as a land of jarring and enigmatic beauty.",
    "Soulful and reflective film, as gentle as it is potent.",
    "Provides a smart, insightful prologue to the career of the man who continues to inspire countless people around the world.",
    "A mesmerizing look at an asthmatic, rich-boy medical student in the act of discovering his insurgent spirit.",
    "More coming-of-age story than biopic, this Guevara odyssey is a transformative adventure well worth watching.",
    "Salles' movie isn't fiery or didactic. It doesn't rage or storm. Salles romanticizes the youthful Ernesto.",
    "A steady, soulful film experience. It's got poetry to it - the poetry of humanity.",
    "Captures the lovely, heart-and-eye-opening ode to youthful possibility with affection and compassion.",
    "Nothing like a full picture of Che--nor of Granado and his eventual scientific career in Cuba, for that matter. But it exhilarates with the spirit of these young men in Act One of their lives.",
    "The film is a deeply felt and beautifully acted hagiography.",
    "This intelligently made picture is artful but not arty, political without being didactic.",
    "Subtle, funny and touching. It’s not like a blow-by-blow “Birth of a Hero” type of film. The script is near perfect and the acting is spot on.",
    "There is a balancing act at work here that sometimes makes the film seem too careful, but I found it a lovely and supremely moving experience, a haunting symphony in a minor key if not a knock-your-socks-off masterpiece.",
    "The movie's not heavyhanded about this coming of moral age; the revelations unfurl in subtle ways. What Bernal and this well-wrought movie convey so well is the charisma that would soon become a part of human history.",
    "There is no great story being told here. Mostly, it is a conventional road movie - a buddy comedy even - about the quests of two likable guys. The memoirs exist only because of Guevara's subsequent fame as a revolutionary leader in Cuba, Congo and Bolivia.",
    "Some might not even notice what's going on when director Walter Salles finally shows his hand, and ends the film with documentary footage of the real-life Granado, now aged 81, romping in the earthly paradise that is present-day Cuba.",
    "Captures some of the spirit of the real Che.",
    "A smartly scoped story of great personal growth and transformation. It's not hard to see the personality/political basis for Che's later revolutionary actions.",
    "Handsomely shot by Brazilian director Walter Salles and beautifully played by the two leads, The Motorcycle Diaries would amount to little more than a minor, softly politically conscious coming-of-age story, if not for its historical context.",
    "The film works best when it doesn't try so hard, when Salles simply allows his excellent actors and his beautiful images to work their magic.",
    "It's a picturesque tale that, hobbled by its episodic structure, never achieves full steam.",
    "Surprisingly effective re-creation of a Latin American Bing and Bob on the Road to History.",
    "\"Dr. Goodlove,\" or \"How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Proletariat\" might have been a better title for this ingratiatingly loopy origin story about prerevolutionary icon Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara.",
    "Seen simply as a film, The Motorcycle Diaries is attenuated and tedious. We understand that Ernesto and Alberto are friends, but that's about all we find out about them; they develop none of the complexities of other on-the-road couples, like Thelma and Louise, Bonnie and Clyde or Huck and Jim. There isn't much chemistry.",
    "For a movie, this feels inadequate, despite its splendors and, later, its social dismay. It does, however, have the makings of a grand postcard.",
    "Lovely to look at but insipid.",
    "Glazed over by its worship of Che Guevara.",
    "It's much easier to linger on his youthful idealism than on how that idealism eventually manifested itself. It certainly makes for a much prettier picture. But when your subject is Ernesto ''Che'' Guevara, it is disingenuous.",
    "Much of the film glides past with a slightly purposeless elegance. Astounding landscapes rise and fall away; enticing women glance and dance and disappear.",
    "A gorgeously burnished vintage post card come to life, Motorcycle Diaries has about as much depth and emotional currency as the cardboard that post card would be stamped on.",
    "It never conjures up any coherent drama of its own, focusing instead on the historical destiny of Bernal's beefcake messiah."

Unfortunately it lacks a litle bit more depth. Guevara's moral coming of age is determined by too few episodes. \"How much unjustice\", he claims when he's about to return to Argentina. And anyone who knows South America, and anyone who has read his diaries, knows he met quite a lot more reasons to become conscious about what was/is happening in the continent. Anyway. I would like to make just one coment to a couple of the site users : I don't know what you are taught in your History classes in the USA, but to consider Che Guevara a mass murderer reveals either an absolute abscence of knowledge on the subject, or an absolute abscence of knowledge of the english language.",

For those who criticize the movie as creating a false portrait of a man who would later advocate violent revolution, have they so little imagination that they are unable to comprehend how a young person who goes off to discover the world could legitimately grow from a sheltered son of privilege into a revolutionary, given the conditions of the world? One's politics are generally formed by your life experiences, and for most U.S. citizens, their experience is standardized television/mall living, with few ever traveling out of their racial ghetto, much less out of the U.S. Whatever else a viewer might get from the film, would that it might be an interest in making his or her own journey of discovery--to places that no one in the family has ever visited. Go for six months. See if you, like Ernesto/Che aren't changed. Things don't happen for no reason at all, my fellow citizens.",

Almost thirty years ago I spent several years working in South America, a quarter century after Ché blew through those same places. This movie gets so many of the small things about the cultures perfectly correct that it comes as no surprise that non-actors were used in these scenes. It is as if you are making the road trip too and that is, indeed, the strength of this movie. The quiet comraderie of the two principles is inviting. Their journey is quixotic, amusing, romantic and not a little foolhardy, but you'd die to be doing it, too! Critics have claimed that by failing to tackle the reality of Ché's future the film does a disservice to the realities of his past. I would say that the film shows the blank slate of youth filling with experiential awareness and hinting at how those experiences might mix with the character's inherent tendencies. The future is not yet known, but the possibilities are being outlined. I think that it is done very, very well.",

Ticking for two hours, the journey does getbetter late than never..The Motorcycle DiariesSalles's two wheeler ride may be uncomfortable but it is a success on reaching its destination, maybe not on time, but better late than never. Ticking for two hours, the journey does get hectic. But just as such long trip consists, it is brimmed with essential stops that juices up the track if it gets dry and weary. The concept calls for the storyline to be a series of different events and stops, but the performance holds you on your seat and gives you enough reason to stay till the last station arrives. As much as adaptive and layered the narration is, it isn't sharp, it doesn't speak to you a lot.You have to search for it, nothing is served up front in here which is often good but only if it teases you to look for it and keep things intriguing. The rich cultures, beautiful live locations, real earthiness and a grounded dusty or cold roads does travel to you and on that tour-guide note it is a triumph. Aforementioned, the performance is what the feature thrives on. The passion wearing down and rebirthing itself from the ashes like a phoenix, Bernal is the apt companion to have for this trip. He is not confident, he is reserved, simple and more importantly makes mistake; a non provocative three dimensional character.Serna as his supporting character holds onto his part convincingly. This over thought out philosophical medicine is admirable but certainly not cinematic enough to balance the husky and crispy bits alongside. The characteristics of the protagonist keeps surprising you throughout the course, his ideologies, his stubborn nature, everything opens big arms for the audience. The Motorcycle Diaries is like a ride and a diary-writing-habit, it can be sweat inducing but in the end it's worth every drop of it.",

For my happiness, the register and the emphasis are much more intimate, biographical and human than, properly speaking, political. InI decided to watch this film with some fear of finding just one piece of socialist or communist propaganda. For my happiness, the register and the emphasis are much more intimate, biographical and human than, properly speaking, political. In fact, if we didn't know the figure of Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara so well, and what he will come to be and represent, the film would not help us much to understand or know much more.The film is the result of the cinematographic adaptation of two books by Ernesto Guevara (\"Notes from Travel\") and by Alberto Granado (\"With Che across South America\"), who are the protagonists of the film. It's a film told in the first person, and it tells us about the great trip on a motorbike that the two friends and medical colleagues decided to make throughout the various countries of South America that speak the Spanish language, and in which Guevara will feel like increasingly interested in helping and defending the poorest and weakest in society.The script is much better than I expected and focuses on the trip made and how the same trip affects and changes the personalities of the two companions, particularly Guevara's. The friendship between both protagonists is solid enough to never be compromised by any obstacles or setbacks, and the tribulations they both go through can be really comical and give the film a lighter tone than expected. The film is not politically charged, and the effort to depoliticize it may have gone beyond what is necessary: in fact, the contact Guevara has with the poor and weakest in society is reduced to a set of innocuous testimonies that, I confess, seem superficial to me.Skillfully directed by the Brazilian Walter Salles, the film features excellent performances by Gael Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna, two Hispanic actors whom I naturally didn't know, but who I enjoyed watching work. Both are excellent when acting together and collaborate very fruitfully, with the first one trying to avoid losing his character's joviality at the expense of a premature social and political conscience, and the latter refusing to be just the playful friend of a more important character.Technically, it's exquisite and full of details, starting immediately with an attentive and careful cinematography that knows how to make each scene visually immersive and beautiful without taking the focus from the essentials. The careful choice of filming locations contributes with an additional beauty, in a true tour of the most scenic places in Latin America. The entire setting, costumes and props are good and fit the chronology in which all the events take place. I did not observe major problems of anachrony or lack of historical rigor. The music is quite good, but it doesn't stand out particularly. Finally, a brief note of praise for the use of Castilian as a language, to the detriment of the commercially better option for the English language, which would eventually sell the film more easily but bring with it a sense of unpleasant artificiality.",
