    "critic_reviews": [
        "A conventionally heightened series of escapes and clashes and hide-and-seek gambits, yet the way the film has been made, nothing that happens seems inevitable -- which is to say, anything seems possible. There's a word for that sensation. It's called excitement.",
        "This is high-speed action realism carried off with the dexterity of a magician pulling a hundred rabbits out of a hat in one graceful gesture. The crowning flourish is an extended car chase through the streets and tunnels of Moscow that ranks as one of the three or four most exciting demolition derbies ever filmed.",
        "Spy movies just got thrilling again.",
        "Rarely does pop come with such sizzle.",
        "As a piece of craft, and with the exception of \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\" it's miles beyond any studio film this summer.",
        "The sequel is simply a tour-de-force of thriller filmmaking.",
        "Close to perfect example of an expertly designed and executed thriller.",
        "Trumping its predecessor with a tauter plot, a lower body count and just as many edge-of-the-seat jolts.",
        "Taut, tightly paced and thrilling, with some of the best chase sequences -- whether by foot, taxi or Jeep -- in recent memory.",
        "Greengrass has a fine sense of pacing, keeping events moving. It's rarely hard to guess what's going to happen next, but events unfold with such gusto that there's barely time to notice that.",
        "If you've forgotten the kick you get from watching a globe-trotting, butt-kicking, whiplash-paced action movie done with humor, style and smarts, take a ride with The Bourne Supremacy.",
        "Delivers the expected adrenaline-driven thrills with a fresh eye and a refreshing attitude.",
        "The action sequences are expert studies in controlled chaos.",
        "Goes through its airport-thriller paces with dazzling kinetics and style.",
        "Plot matters more here than spectacle; the film's real climax involves no demolition, but rather two characters in a room quietly discussing devastating events in their past.",
        "The Bourne Supremacy builds on and exceeds the original, delivering, quite simply, one of the finest big-budget thrillers in years.",
        "Achieves an assaultive intensity that adds a level of visceral excitement to car chases, mano-a-mano showdowns -- even simple conversations. It's a style that takes some getting used to -- the images flit by at near-subliminal speeds -- but proves tremendously effective.",
        "That the director, Paul Greengrass, treats the material with gravity and uses good actors in well-written supporting roles elevates the movie above its genre, but not quite out of it.",
        "Directed by Paul Greengrass, the unflinching eye behind \"Bloody Sunday,\" The Bourne Supremacy not only lives up to the promises of the novel by Robert Ludlum, but in many ways manages to improve on the first film.",
        "The strapping Damon's lived-in performance makes us happy to follow Bourne wherever he may go.",
        "The way Greengrass lets you feel the violence is impressive. Most movie heroes punch through armies without scraping their knuckles, but Bourne's a believable wreck by midpoint.",
        "Solid summer entertainment set in a recognizably real world.",
        "The action is confusing at first and the hyperventilated editing style at times goes beyond the pale, so pic ultimately emerges as an erratic but not unworthy sequel to its gritty, genre-invigorating predecessor.",
        "Supremacy is, minor quibbles aside, a worthy successor to \u201cThe Bourne Identity.\u201d",
        "Over all, though, the picture fires on all pistons. The globetrotting's a good time-I can't think of another spy film that's featured as delightful an assortment of seamy international undersides.",
        "Putting it mildly, this style of shallow, panting composition isn't the way I\u2019d like movies to go, but, of its kind, The Bourne Supremacy is incredibly skilled--much more exciting than its predecessor.",
        "All herky-jerky camera movements and no pussyfooting around with the interior lives of these characters.",
        "Supremacy has thrills, but without Potente's presence, it loses its soul.",
        "A serviceable thriller - no more, no less.",
        "Like its various post-Cold War European locations, the film remains chilly and distant. \r\nEvery time you feel like you're finally grabbing hold of something involving, the picture once again spins frustratingly out of reach.",
        "The loss of the first film's hurtling who-am-I? story engine is keenly felt, and too much time is spent observing the characters get on and off planes, trains, and automobiles.",
        "A refreshing alternative to the hypertrophied spy thrillers in which exaggerated action sequences, over-the-top super-villainy and high-tech gadgetry trump character and plot.",
        "In Supremacy, Damon is left to play basically one droning, humorless note, which, unfortunately, he does with his eyes closed.",
        "This time it's just chasing, fistfighting, and shooting. A disappointment from the director of \"Bloody Sunday.\"",
        "Almost everything that made \"The Bourne Identity\" refreshing -- the wit, the irony, the suspense, the novelty of its premise -- is gone in The Bourne Supremacy, and what's left is the spectacle of Matt Damon, with perfect posture and senses primed like a cat, making his way through a routine action thriller.",
        "The movie is mostly a series of frenetic clashes, dubious near misses and car chases. It lacks the human interest and snowy splendor of the first movie, directed by Doug Liman.",
        "What\u2019s missing here is the amnesiac hook that made \"The Bourne Identity\" such a sleeper hit.",
        "I had some trouble with the plot, but I'm not the only one -- so did the screenwriter."

There are a lot of action franchises, such as Pirates of the Caribbean andThere is one thing I appreciate about The Bourne movies more then anything else about them. And that is that they exist not only to make money, but to be a good movie. There are a lot of action franchises, such as Pirates of the Caribbean and Sherlock Holmes, that only exist to make money. They can be entertaining, but there's not a lot of thought put into them. The Bourne series tries to be a good movie, and they, for the most part, succeed. Of course, the two films I've seen thus far in the trilogy have not been without flaws. Far from it really. But they are entertaining, at the bare minimum, they have a plot, and well-defined characters. The Bourne Supermacy, like it's predecessor is not perfect, but it's trying. The Bourne Supremacy still contains the key plot elements from the first film: Jason Bourne is trying to learn more about his past, there's a plot to find and kill him, and utter confusion for both parties. The twist is that Bourne is being assumed for a crime he didn't commit (the murder of two agents). Once again, the similarities to the 90's The Fugitive are present, but I've delved into that in my previous review of the first film. In short, The Fugitive does a much better job. The Bourne Supremacy sports believable acting, much like the first. Action movies are famous for laughable dialogue and stiff acting, but The Bourne Supermacy has neither. Matt Damon performs very well for this episode in the Bourne trilogy. The rest of the actors also perform well, but it's pointless to compliment each actor individually. The action is considerably better in this sequel than in the original. Also, there are some very good chase scenes (there were chase scenes in the first, but they were quite dull to be honest), even though some of the automobiles seem a little too indestructible. There's even some well-needed emotion that wasn't present the last time around. The score, however, is less than satisfactory. The percussion is much too loud and overpowering, often annoying. Some of the instrument choices are questionable (including one instrument that we hear twice that resembles the belch of an obese couch potato), and many of the themes feel a little lost. Also, there are some jarring similarities to the superior Pirates of the Caribbean score. Also, the girl we see sleeping with Bourne at the beginning of the film is Marie from the first film. I tell you this, because I would not have recognized her if my companion had not told me so. Her hair is blonde, she looks different (she's wearing more makeup) and she even SOUNDS different. It doesn't make too much of a difference, though, because she dies within twenty minutes of the film's opening. And this brings up a major flaw of this movie: Bourne doesn't have a partner. In one respect, this works better because now Bourne is free to move at his own pace. However, this gives Bourne a little less personality, and it makes certain parts of the film feel a little empty. One scene at the beginning is near a stand with tons and tons of Lays brand potato chips, all the labels facing the screen. It would be hard to believe that there wasn't some sort of pay-off here. Also, there's a completely unnecessary scene that occurs in a club. There are some skimpily dressed women and it just feels so thrown in. This scene was literally added just for male appeal, and it disgusts me that this was thrown in just because guys like to see half-naked women. Really? It's unnecessary and tasteless. I digress. Lastly, The Bourne Supremacy doesn't feel completely connected to the first film. That's not to say it contradicts the first, but I feel confident that someone could watch The Bourne Supermacy with no knowledge of the first film and completely understand what was going on. The Bourne Supremacy is just as good as the original, and maybe just a bit better. There's problems to be sure; irritating score, unnecessary club scene, and the fact that the seeing the first film isn't even necessary for viewing this sequel. But the fantastic cast, great action and chase scenes, and some actual emotion more than make up for it's shortcomings.",

And this is what this movie is about: Instinct. Instinct of survival. If the movie is too fast for you, try watching it in slow-motion.",

Matt Damon is still dynamic as the titular Jason Bourne. The action can be a little hectic, which is what holds this one back a bit, as it can be hard to follow during the action sequences. It can also get a little bogged down in the details like all spy flicks, but all the same, this is a very good action spy thriller. Director Paul Greengrass certainly knows what he is doing and knows how to tell a good story. The film is thrilling, the score is good, and the cinematography has moments of absolute brilliance (the shot of Bourne walking to his car in snow covered Russia comes to mind).

The story follows the amnesiac titular character (Damon) as he attempts to find out more about his past as a black ops agent for the CIA. One of the things I noticed first about this film was the film's shift in aesthetics. Though Director Paul Greengrass' use of hand-held cameras has often come under considerable disagreement from some critics and fans, I feel that this aspect of the film really sort of adds to the intensity of a lot of the action and dialogue sequences. While the camerawork may have changed, there are certain things about the film that stayed close to what made the first movie so successful. For one, Matt Damon's performance is once again terrific, and with his portrayal, the audience really gets to see some sides of Jason Bourne that they might not gotten to see in \"Identity\". John Powell's score is really well done, as it uses all of the themes from \"Identity\", but develops upon those themes so that we feel as though we are watching a different chapter in Bourne's life. Tony Gilroy's screenplay contains really compelling and entertaining dialogue and a very interesting adaption of Robert Ludlum's story. The action sequences are spectacular as well, for they once again showcase Jason Bourne's incredible ability to overcome immense odds with the skills he learned in the CIA. All in all, I felt that \"The Bourne Supremacy\" was a worthy installment in the \"Bourne\" franchise that upped the emotion and action to an impressive degree.",

The bliss ends suddenly after someone tries to frame Bourne for CIA deal gone wrong. \"Bourne Supremacy\" sets dynamic pace from the beginning. The storyline isn't as original and surprising as in \"Bourne Identity\", but it's a solid spy movie. No exaggeration. When I watch it I feel like I'm watching real, credible spy agency operation.\r The cinematography and fast cuts are a slight disappointment. In some fights and chases the scenes are too short, too jumpy. And I get it, I accept SOME shaky camera work in action sequence. But a calm conversation? Two people talking and I'm almost getting motion sickness, because the cinematographer can't keep a persons face in the frame. Other than that, the film is superb. Easily among my \"top 10 ever\". The casting team did a marvelous job. Matt Damon IS Jason Bourne. I'll always see Ward Abbott when I see Brian Cox. Joan Allen is not my favorite actress, but does very believable performance as Pamela Landy. Karl Urban became one of best cinema villains. His coldness fits the mood of the whole movie. A few years earlier I thought Karl Urban would always be Eomer from \"The Lord of the Rings\". Nope. Karl Urban is Kirill, the cold-blooded FSB hitman. And Marton Csokas, the Munich asset also performs brilliantly.\r I've seen the movie a few times. Maybe five. Every time I rewatch it I'm amazed how good a film can be without over the top CGI effects. Believable weapons, realistic explosions, brilliant hand-to-hand combat (Munich fight is one of best cinema fights EVER) and the Moscow car chase, damn, those cars crashing in the Volga taxi, the cars in the tunnel and the final crash inside the tunnel - WOW. My favorite movie car chase. Ever. There are some slight deficiencies about manual gear handling or survivability of head-on crash in a Volga (rrright), but other than that the chase is excellent.\r The soundtrack is very pleasant. Quite similar to the first movie. The general setting and filming locations provide immersively gloomy atmosphere. Cinematography is quite good if you forget about the shaking. Gripping action sequences and general fast-pace make it a very entertaining film. Highly recommended!",

Despite having another director (the first was directed by Doug Liman and this was directed by Paul Greengrass), the script was secured by the same author, Tony Gilroy, which contributed decisively, I don't doubt, to the feeling of unity I got when watching both. In fact, the points of contact between the two stories are evident in the way they marry and harmonize, forming a homogeneous whole.In this film, Bourne is in Goa (an Indian city with a strong connection to Portugal), where he ends up being chased and sees his girlfriend die. From there, he understands that something is up, and that he has returned to being a target to shoot down for the CIA, for whatever reason he doesn't know. Of course, he's been the target of a very well-crafted plot at the highest levels of the organization, and he's going to have to flee and defend himself as they try to kill him. Most of the film consists of pure action, with mind-blowing chases, shooting and tension: in an effort not to displease those who liked its predecessor, the film offers more of the same. Despite that, I felt that there was an effort on the part of the script to put more emphasis on the story told, and to give us a good story, not just an excuse for endless action scenes. For me, that's enough to make this movie even more interesting than the first one.Matt Damon continues the good work he started on the franchise's initial film, even managing to develop his character further and work on it better. If I found what I saw in the first film uninteresting, I am pleased to see a general improvement in the actor's work, and also in the material he was given to work with. Joan Allen was excellent at bringing to life Pamela Landy, the director of the CIA who, despite leading the effort to hunt down Bourne, will also try to understand her motives and understand the reasons that drive him to act. She is charismatic and effortlessly grabs our attention. Julia Stiles, back in the role of Nicky, a hypothetical love interest from Bourne's past, is equally happy in her work. Brian Cox and Carl Urban are also very good. In this film, it is Franka Potente who loses out, with her character disappearing from the scene.Technically, it's a film equivalent to its predecessor, with high production values and a lot of money involved. The pace is intense and things are happening very fast, so you need to be attentive, or you will miss important details. The film is once again located almost entirely in Europe, cleverly taking advantage of European filming locations in Moscow, Berlin and Naples, with a brief visit to the so Portuguese Goa, in India. The cinematography is discreet but elegant, except for the shaky footage of a series of very concrete scenes. The editing also has moments when it doesn't seem to be at its best, with several scenes out of order and successive cuts. The film continues to have many intense action scenes, with frequent use of good special effects, visuals and sound, and stunts for the most dangerous scenes.",
