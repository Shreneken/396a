  "critic_reviews": [
    "Pure magic.",
    "Depp and Winslet in particular are, as you might expect, immaculate. I don't think there's another actor alive who can convey the intermingling of gentleness and passion with as much precision as Depp.",
    "It's a real pleasure to find a movie as calm, measured and dead-on in its impact as Finding Neverland.",
    "Glorious entertainment.",
    "It's an intellectual family film for literate parents and children, immensely pleasing if not perfect, perhaps a smidgen too brightly evasive and determinedly charming.",
    "The glory of the movie is Depp, who achieves his own immortality.",
    "Surprisingly moving.",
    "Johnny Depp has finally won me over to rabid support after \"Neverland\" and \"Pirates of the Caribbean.\" He gives the most controlled, least mannered performance of his career, staying sweet and rueful while suggesting unseen emotional depths.",
    "Mingling reality and fantasy, Forster has given us a luminous, touching meditation on life and art.",
    "A rewarding piece of filmmaking that has all the makings of a classic weepie.",
    "An impeccably made and genuinely moving account of how Scottish author J.M. Barrie came to write \"Peter Pan.\"",
    "Gently seductive, genuinely tender and often moving without being maudlin.",
    "Depp is a charm. He becomes his own, subtly compelling Barrie.",
    "Takes you back to a time in which people – children, in particular – still created whole worlds in their heads, inventing characters and situations as far away as their flights of fancy would take them.",
    "Depp portrays a fellow who is openly gentle to the core, and the actor just about wraps the movie around his lilting delivery and quiescent gaze.",
    "Compelling and life-affirming.",
    "Forster keeps the picture as a whole in perfect tune with Depp's approach.",
    "The story is told gently and simply without excess sentimentality. It is a welcome departure from more contrived holiday fare.",
    "Delightful and moving - although fanciful.",
    "Because it's a well-crafted and superbly acted sweet little tearjerker, we're content too -- it's a mild pleasure to watch.",
    "The plays and amusements the boys put on--by far the most successfully magical scenes in the movie--inspire Barrie to create his great work, \"Peter Pan.\"",
    "The film rests on Depp's evocation of Barrie's gentle, playfulness and deeply buried sorrows; it's difficult to imagine another actor so gracefully evoking Barrie's childlike qualities without seeming creepy or emotionally malformed, and only the hard of heart will come away dry-eyed.",
    "A worthwhile way to spend some of your precious leisure time, especially in this season of obnoxious cartoons and ham-handed holiday fare.",
    "We have a whole new reason to appreciate cinema's most creative chameleon (Depp)  since Peter Sellers. The film itself is pretty and sweet but a tad soggy.",
    "Handsome, professional and dutiful, but it never feels inspired.",
    "Washes over you with an enjoyable gloss, and it might even make you cry a little, but it evaporates in memory like fairy dust.",
    "It's a portrait of the artist as Mary Poppins.",
    "It just doesn't have the buoyancy, or the resonance, that this kind of semifactual flight of fancy needs.",
    "You're expected to weep, and perhaps you will weep. But if you do, it's not likely that you'll respect yourself in the morning.",
    "Depp and Highmore's final scene together strikes a muted blow of desolation -- bottomless but just bearable -- that Forster rather bravely lets stand as the last word on all the fanciful solace that Barrieland had to offer.",
    "Surprisingly wan film.",
    "A handsome-looking film about the writer and his unripe inspirations, the actor Johnny Depp neither soars nor crashes, but moseys forward with vague purpose and actorly restraint.",
    "A sappy excursion to Edwardian days.",
    "Precious and uninsightful but ends beautifully.",
    "Finding Neverland takes a big, brave leap and lands splat on the sidewalk.",
    "Forster's movie doesn't want to grow up, but it doesn't seem to understand childhood, either. For a film about the life-affirming power of imagination, Finding Neverland displays precious little of its own.",
    "Dismal and heavy, and the failure rests chiefly with Johnny Depp, who plays Barrie."

During the last hour or so it began to engage me, and by the end it was actually somewhat moving.  That doesn't change the fact that the first 40 minutes were extremely boring.  And when I say extremely I mean horrendously.  It just seemed so repetitive and pointless during that section.  There wasn't any adult drama.  Just Johnny Depp playing make believe with a couple of kids and their mom.  This could have worked if it wasn't done so blandly, and if it was rendered more convincingly.  Yes it does eventually become involving.  Its story takes some formulaic but effective turns, and the acting was solid, but it should have been good from the get go.  The production design and cinematography were pretty throughout but nothing groundbreaking.  You may like the movie more than I did.  I thought it was decent, but I'm not sure if it was worth enduring the first forty minutes.",

I think it tactfully teaches that marriage is to be taken seriously before one enters into the contract, and I think that that is an important message for our modern world.  While the movie is child appropriate it isn’t especially child friendly, unless they are precocious I think that they may very well bore of it; the movie is really more for adults.  If the kids are interested however they are certainly welcome.  I have no complaints about this film.  Dramas aren’t my first preference when it comes to entertainment, but if you like dramas I have to imagine you will love Finding Neverland.  Clean nostalgia evoking thought provoking heartfelt fun.",

Plus it madeOf course it takes liberties with the truth, not the first biographical drama to do that, but I cannot deny that Finding Neverland was very magical and affecting and was beautifully crafted not only in visuals but in acting too. Plus it made me believe in Peter Pan again, and that is a wonderful feeling as Peter Pan is one of my all-time favourite stories. The cinematography, costumes, locations and scenery are absolutely stunning, and the score gives the film its magical feeling. The script had its deft touches, the story had a perfect balance of the humorous and the tragic, and director Marc Forster deserves credit for making even those mundane events into something somewhat enchanting. The acting is wonderful too- Johnny Depp is nothing short of magnificent as JM Barrie as he alternates between being playful and sensitive, it was his sensitive side especially that made his performance so good. Kate Winslet is very tender as Sylvia and Dustin Hoffmann impresses in a smaller role. Even the kids were good, especially Freddie Highmore who offers a wonderful portrayal as the serious-minded Peter. In conclusion, beautiful film, very affecting when it needed to be and quite magical to say the least. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

No, it is the story of another celebrity?.i.e. James Barrie, a portion of his life and those that played such an integral and important part in it. It is the story of the writer?s role in creating, seeing and perhaps even being Peter Pan. One of the great children?s stories of all time is perhaps more a reflection and statement about the life of Mr. Barrie than the fictional character in the property. This is truly a ,quality movie. The writing, acting and directing are excellent. Johnny Depp is marvelous in his role as James Barrie. He gives an understated and meaningful portrayal matched by the quality work by Kate Winslett. Of course, the coups de gras and best performance, in my opinion, is given by the young boy named ?Peter? about whom much of the Pan character was based. It is very difficult to direct young children but as with everything, the greater the risk, the greater the reward?..so, too, when the directing of the child brings about a memorable and gut wrenching result , the accolades go to where they belong. Marc Forster does a really fine job of directing and, coupled with a great screenplay and wonderful acting, the movie gets and deserves an 8 with a strong >recommendation to go and see it. Dustin Hoffman, for nostalgic reasons I believe (he played Capt. Hook in \"Hook\"), is in the picture but his scenes are so short and inconsequential that you realize he?s there because, well, as Peter says, ?you have to believe?. Have fun and learn what really was behind the creation and writing of ?Peter Pan?. As Wendy would say, ?wiggle your shoulders and fly to the movie?. ",

Rarely does a film move me to tears, but this one absolutely succeeded. Packed to the brim with magic, imagination, fun, and a childlike wonder, this film inspires hope and belief, all while tearing you down emotionally. I know it may not be as historically accurate as some would hope, but this is what a biopic should be. It covers the relevant topics and still touches you in a way only fiction can, a truly challenging task for most biopics. Johnny Depp is fantastic here, as are  Kate Winslet and all of the young Davies boys. The film's magic and sense of wonder it inspires never really ceases, but certainly extends to the overall message of the film that captures the essence of Peter Pan as well; just believe. The film's cinematography is great, especially the final sequence with Sylvia and the score is also very well done. Finally, the plays within a film that get put on throughout the film are fantastic and brilliantly done, capturing that same imagination and suspension of reality. Finding Neverland is a truly wondrous work.",

The screenplay by David Magee may not be gripping or intriguing enough to invest in it but it surely is effective and has a soul in it. Marc Forster fails to create the anticipated impact that was already present in the script and misses a big window there. The feature scores majestically on performance where every supporting actor (Kate Winslet, Dustin Hoffman and the young cast) factors in, with equal input among the protagonist i.e. Johnny Depp. Finding Neverland has stellar performance, amazing background score and fine editing that favors on its side but lacks better execution and the crisp that everyone awaits throughout the course of it.",

Contrary to what the film seems to indicate, he was a highly regarded playwright and had prestige when he wrote the play thatThis film is not exactly a film about Peter Pan, but about its creator, the English playwright J. M. Barrie. Contrary to what the film seems to indicate, he was a highly regarded playwright and had prestige when he wrote the play that definitively immortalized him. In fact, the film is a little inaccurate in the way it tells the events of the playwright's life, which is always a pity for me, who appreciate it when a biographical film is faithful to the life of the one who is biographed. The movie is good, it's really good. You just need to understand this: it's a movie, so it's partially fiction.In this film, Barrie is a man who is unhappy in his marriage and deeply dissatisfied with his own plays, someone who feels he can do better and demands it of himself. So he decides to use his life with a group of children, sons of a London high society widow, to be inspired by the creation of a new story. But the unusual relationship between him and the Davies family will be opposed by his own wife, the children's grandmother, and also by the sarcastic looks of Victorian society.The film makes great use of the relationship between Barrie and the children... a relationship that would surely make many people frown these days. In fact, we live today under a society that I think is more suspicious and that has difficulty believing that someone really has good intentions in their attitudes. The story is good, the script, despite not being faithful to Barrie's life, is well done and well written, and the direction of Marc Forster proved to be very good.The cast has several well-known names, but the main role is Johnny Depp. He's one of those actors that we're used to associating with strange, unusual, out-of-the-box characters. In this case, it's the opposite. He embodies an elegant, discreet, restrained Victorian gentleman with a quiet personality, albeit with a vivid imagination. He once again shows versatility and skill as an actor, and does a very happy job. Kate Winslet also needs no introduction and has signed credits. In this film, she presents us with a very good job, where she manages to rub shoulders with her colleagues in a character that seems to me to be psychologically demanding. Julie Christie brings the Davies family matriarch to life in an elegant way, very in keeping with the historical period, and in a convincing way. Despite appearing much less on screen and having a nasty character, Radha Mitchell successfully carried out her task and handled it well.Technically, the film has an excellent cinematography, which actually manages to be even more interesting when it shows us, in brief glimpses, the magical world that begins to emerge in the playwright's mind. The construction of the sets and the choice of props helped to create a convincing and realistic period environment, and the selection of some sets even added visual elegance to the film, especially in the theater and park scenes. Also, a word of praise for the idealization of the costumes and for the soundtrack.",

I hadn't realised the author was Scottish, until it dawned on me that Depp was seemingly attempting a sort of cringey mix of English and Scottish in his accent in this film. It didn't seem entirely believable to me and I'm Scottish!. It would seem unfair to say it ruins the film because his accent isn't great but its still something that came to mind when I was thinking what to say about the film, hence me mentioning it.However, regarding the cast, Kate Winslet does well in her role as Barries wife, Sylvia. Of course she's English, so she doesn't have to try and put on an accent in the same way as Depp had to.It depicts an interesting story - a thoughtful and interesting one. My favourite aspect of it was how the parents interacted and tried to relate things to the kids. It isn't a greatly memorable film but its certainly not awful either. Some of the scenes are surprisingly touching, between the children and the parents. I feel it perhaps could have been better in one or two regards but as it is, its certainly worth a watch if your interested in the story.",
