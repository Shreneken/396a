  "title": "Taxi",
  "rating": 4.8,
  "release_date": "2004-10-06",
  "summary": "New York's fastest cabbie (Queen Latifah) uses her skills beind the wheel of her souped-up car to help an overeager undercover cop (Fallon) pursue a gand of female bank robbers.  (20th Century Fox)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "A surprisingly funny, female-driven romp — as long as you don't question too many plot particulars.",
    "It's loud, it's stupid, yet against all the odds, enjoyable.",
    "Riddled with comic potholes.",
    "Too much of Taxi is just tired.",
    "Director Tim Story's film has two speeds: pedal-to-metal and screeching halt. The former is guaranteed to make the audience carsick, the latter to give it whiplash.",
    "Frivolous but fun, somewhere between a comic \"French Connection\" and the craziest Nascar race you never saw.",
    "How one likes Taxi has everything to do with how one responds to the hapless cop character, played by Jimmy Fallon.",
    "I expected this to be much funnier: Latifah coasts on her charm and Fallon seems incapable of playing an actual character.",
    "Full of car chases, weak jokes and scenes so meandering they make \"Saturday Night Live\" look like a paragon of brevity and wit.",
    "Very little of it works.",
    "Throughout this Americanization of the Luc Besson–scripted French hit, Latifah itches to check her watch, Fallon appears mortified, and only Ann-Margret mainlines any comic adrenalin.",
    "A bland, half-finished film that seems to have been conceived as off-peak cable fodder.",
    "Queen Latifah is a natural-born charmer, but there's only so much she can do when paired with a costar so irritating it's hard not to squirm when he's on the screen, which is most of the time.",
    "This thoroughly repetitive, ill-conceived and poorly executed effort -- with an emphasis on the word \"effort\" -- defeats these two talented people more often than not.",
    "Commits any number of comedic violations during an aimless pursuit of laughs.",
    "It would take the ghost of Stanley Kubrick to get great performances out of Jimmy Fallon, Queen Latifah, and supermodel Gisele Bündchen, and Tim, you're no Stanley.",
    "Goes nowhere fast.",
    "Feels stitched together from bits and pieces of lame '80s buddy-cop movies.",
    "The glitch, beyond the rote story, is that while she's an infectiously upbeat screen presence, Latifah is not, inherently, a major laugh generator, and neither, it would appear, is Fallon.",
    "Bad as he is, Fallon cannot claim Taxi's worst moment. That belongs to Ann-Margret.",
    "Taxi's only saving grace is an inexplicable, though delightful, turn by Ann-Margret as Andy's ever-tipsy mom. She's a stitch, and about 100 times better than her surrounding material.",
    "In a film that is wall-to-wall idiocy, the most tiresome delusion is that car chases are funny.",
    "An action-choked dud in which even the closing outtakes barely deserve to be left on the cutting-room floor?",
    "If this is magic, I'll take \"Gigli.\"",
    "This witless action comedy begins to insult the audience's intelligence from the opening scene.",
    "Very nearly as entertaining as watching a potato bake."
