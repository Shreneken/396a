    "summary": "The adventure continues with a new generation of talking toddlers.

(Sony)",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "The film's moral? Turn off the TV, young 'uns, and go outside and play! And avoid Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 matinees while you're at it.",
        "Apart from Jon Voight, slumming and turning in a rather droll, if lonely, performance as the German-accented villain, the movie amounts to cynical, cutesy claptrap.",
        "The overall effect is ghoulish.",
        "The sequel retains not only the same gimmicky premise as the original but its preference for cliche-ridden dialogue and flat-footed comedy as well.",
        "Entirely too convoluted for kids and implausible even by the standards set by the original concept.",
        "Here's a late-August dog-days atrocity from the \"aren't farts funny?\" school of filmmaking.",
        "Features even more toddlers acting in a way only collectors of velvet paintings will consider irresistible.",
        "Spectacularly awful.",
        "Spending an hour and a half inside a uterus might be more entertaining than this tiresome sequel.",
        "As for anyone else who may experience a sudden need for therapy after sitting through this, you're on your own.",
        "Falls short on nearly every level, from production values to an inexplicable cameo by Whoopi Goldberg.",
        "So bad that I predict there will be drinking games set around viewing it someday.",
        "This excruciating sequel tries to squeeze a few more bucks from the \"Spy Kids\" espionage formula.",
        "The first Baby Geniuses, released in 1999, was one of the most inane, humorless, ill-conceived, poorly acted comedies of the year. As difficult as it is to imagine, the sequel is even worse, earning an F.",
        "Villainy toward the infant class now comes from Jon Voight, descending to the depths of his 37-year-career.",
        "May quite easily put an end to any discussion of what is the worst theatrical release of 2004.",
        "The most perversely unnecessary sequel in recent memory.",
        "This is a movie that should have bypassed the theatres and gone straight to DVD. It is offensive on so many levels."

If Gaben, Dale, Jesus, Calvin of Calvin and Hobbs, and Nicolas Cage collaborated on a game it was pale to the sheer mastery that is Battletoads. I am going through Battletoad withdraw even now, 43 words into this review. Imagine the best feeling in the world. That is slave labor in a North Korean (best Korea) lumber camp, forced to work long hours at the threat of your young child's life relative to the level of euphoria realized by even the settings menu of this piece of art. I didn't think it was possible to capture the magnificence of the original Battletoads and condense it to my phone, but it happened. The graphics are just as stunning as the original NES game, the controls just as tight. The characters are endearing and the humor adds to the fantastic story. The gameplay is fast-paced yet wearisome it was not; I had to resort to less than \"traditional\" methods in order for my feeble mind to respond to the stimulus Battletoads has to offer; my neighbor \"Dope\" Dan and I became quite close acquaintances, or would have if it weren't for the draw of the game. This game is without fault, bar none, save for the fact that it is not endless, however the replay value and incredible story depth, as well as subtle references drew me in for playthrough after playthrough. I could easily log hundreds of hours if it weren't for my pesky human body not being able to handle the incredible volume of dopamine coursing through my mortal veins and its inability to function great lengths of time without nourishment and intestinal relief, although the latter difficulty is easily solved by a trip to Walgreen's for a 24 pack of adult diapers, unfortunately I depleted their stock before long. All in all, this game is better than going out for mint chocolate chip ice cream with Jesus, the guy from the Dos Equis commercials, and Olivia Wilde while riding a Charizard. In fact, comparing Battletoads to such a scenario is ridiculous, as is any comparison, because this level of quality is in a class of its own. All else is trash's trash, regurgitated by Satan and Hitler. Anyone who has ever enjoyed anything absolutely must pick up Battletoads. Just be sure you have enough adult diapers. Collapse",
