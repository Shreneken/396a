  "critic_reviews": [
    "Dramatic, funny, fun, silly, musical, stylish, romantic and redemptive -- a film worth telling your friends and neighbors about.",
    "Though it doesn't quite match recent classics like \"Kabhi khushi kabhie gham\" in sheer technique and production sheen, in-depth star casting and thorough entertainment values make this a must-see for Bollywatchers.",
    "Yash Chopra's thinly veiled plea for reconciliation between India and Pakistan is cloaked in a decades-spanning Romeo-and-Juliet romance.",
    "With just the right balance of epic grandeur and break-into-song goofiness, this Bollywood love legend does double duty as a women's-rights manifesto and a plea for amity between India and Pakistan.",
    "If Veer-Zaara were an American television movie, it would be embraced as fabulously trashy."
