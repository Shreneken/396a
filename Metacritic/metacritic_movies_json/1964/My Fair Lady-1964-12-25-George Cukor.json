  "critic_reviews": [
    "Cukor doesn't try to hide the stage origins of his material; rather, he celebrates the falseness of his sets, placing his characters in a perfectly designed artificial world. Every frame of this 1964 film bespeaks Cukor's grace and commitmentâ€”it's an adaptation that becomes completely personal through the force of its mise-en-scene.",
    "Audrey Hepburn is a physical wonder; Rex Harrison defines his role; and production designer Gene Allen is the hidden star. A big screen production for the entire family.",
    "The picture is exquisite, extraordinary, a unique gem of filmmaking.",
    "The picture sparkles with witty dialogue, titilates with droll situations, stirs the heart with its story of the metamorphosis of a London guttersnipe in a fine lady, and its romantic intervals glow with warmth and charm that fascinates the audience.",
    "In this literal, beautiful, bountiful version of the most gilt-edged attraction in theater history, Jack Warner has miraculously managed to turn gold into gold.",
    "It has riches of story, humor, acting and production values far beyond the average big picture. It is Hollywood at its best.",
    "This 1964 film, featuring an enduring Lerner and Loewe score, is a classic.",
    "What distinguishes My Fair Lady above all is that it actually says something. It says it in a film of pointed words, unforgettable music and glorious images, but it says it.",
    "A wonderfully stylish and witty movie classic.",
    "Few genres of films are as magical as musicals, and few musicals are as intelligent and lively as My Fair Lady. It's a classic not because a group of stuffy film experts have labeled it as such, but because it has been, and always will be, a pure joy to experience.",
    "A peachy-perfect example of what a movie musical should be.",
    "All things considered, it is the brilliance of Miss Hepburn as the Cockney waif who is transformed by Prof. Henry Higgins into an elegant female facade that gives an extra touch of subtle magic and individuality to the film.",
    "My Fair Lady, for all its kudos, often seems bloodless and never achieves the heights of the production that ran on the Mark Hellinger Theater stage eight times each week from 1956 through 1962.",
    "The sets, costumes (by Cecil Beaton), photography, and Hermes Pan's choreography are all sumptuously impressive, and Harrison makes a fine, arrogant Professor Higgins; but Hepburn is clearly awkward as the Cockney Eliza in the first half, and in general the adaptation is a little too reverential to really come alive."

The costumes, indoor and outdoor scenes are glorious and I was captivated by the story from start to finish. It has great songs, some of which are famous and I didn't know were attributed to this musical and the two leads, particularly Audrey Hepburn, sing and act really well. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and will definitely be watching it again.",
