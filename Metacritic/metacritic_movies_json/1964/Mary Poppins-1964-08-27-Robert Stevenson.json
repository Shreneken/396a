  "critic_reviews": [
    "And a most wonderful, cheering movie it is, with Julie Andrews, the original Eliza of My Fair Lady, playing the title role and with its splices and seams fairly splitting with Poppins marvels turned out by the Walt Disney studio.",
    "Julie Andrews’ first appearance on the screen is a signal triumph and she performs as easily as she sings, displaying a fresh type of beauty nicely adaptable to the color cameras. Van Dyke, as the happy-go-lucky jack-of-all-trades, scores heavily, the part permitting him to showcase his wide range of talents.",
    "Mary Poppins is a near-masterpiece. It’s the best of the first wave of Disney live-action features, and the most complete and satisfying musical of any kind that the studio produced until Beauty And The Beast came along.",
    "Van Dyke's energy is prodigious (especially when he leaps around with a gang of sooty chimney-sweeps on the London rooftops) and the songs are classics.",
    "Tomlinson is the great heart of the movie, the warmth to Andrews’ splinter of ice, who, while sustaining the film’s line in jokey verbosity, still manages to be moving.",
    "The film can hardly contain itself with its catalogue of memorable songs, battery of dance routines, and strong supporting cast.",
    "While it doesn't have the soft-edged sense of wonder that the Travers books have, Walt Disney's 1964 version of the Mary Poppins story does manage to avoid the usual saccharine excesses of his live-action work.",
    "What holds Mary Poppins back from being absolutely perfect (as opposed to practically perfect) is due to the episodic structure of the story. Since scenes and songs were drawn from a range of stories from the book series, they play as a series of random adventures, not an organic progression of a single tale.",
    "One of the greatest children's films ever, MARY POPPINS is as perfect and inventive a musical as anyone could see, with a timeless story, strong performances, a flawless blend of live action and animation, wonderful songs, and a sterling script with all the charm of the P.L. Travers books upon which it is based.",
    "One too many jokes about Dick Van Dyke's dire Cawk-nee accent can drag a movie down.",
    "Though overlong and sometimes over-cute, Mary Poppins is the drollest Disney film in decades, a feat of prestidigitation with many more lifts than lapses.",
    "The movie, like a day at Disney World, pulls the viewer through an incessant, nigh-claustrophobic landscape of surrealism and fun. Resistance is futile; the sugar is the medicine.",
    "The “Whistle While You Work” residue of domestic slavery that colors “A Spoonful of Sugar” aside, Mary Poppins is basically Long Day’s Journey Into Matriarchy (cathartic for some, terrifying for others)."

      "content": "Based in a book from Pamela Lyndon Travers, Mary Poppins, from 1934. A rich familly with two children that are very stubborn and complicated, that every nanny that they had before quit the job or got fired, the parents, that don't have muchBased in a book from Pamela Lyndon Travers, Mary Poppins, from 1934. A rich familly with two children that are very stubborn and complicated, that every nanny that they had before quit the job or got fired, the parents, that don't have much time for the children needs a now one, and from there comes the famous Mary Poppins to be the kids nanny. Right at the first moment the kids already noticed that she ain't really a normal nanny, they see that she has powers and can do thiings that they have never seen before, she will give to the kids and the adults some really nice and songfull adventures with some pretty teachings. Directed by Robert Stevenson, written by Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi and produced by Walt Disney.There is in this movie a interesting world building, a fantastic world in some ways, there is, of course, the normal England life, where the family works and take of the children, there is our world there, like Harry Potter, that clearly have somethings that was inspired from this story, there is another thing happening in the world that almost anyone knows about. There is a admiral with a sailor in a ship at a top of a house, and from there he monitor everyone and tell people what is going on in the neighborhood screaming around, this is so nice, it doesn't really have a big thing in the story, but it is so funny because he actually acts and it is stereotyped like he is a true admiral there, watching for dangerous and situations, it is so fun. Before talking about the Mary Poppins character, another nice building that the movie have done is that making clear that she was a nanny of other children, children that are already grown, at least this is how i did interpreted it, like other people already knew her and knew how things was with her.The character of Mary Poppins is fantastic, she is so mysterious, fun and a delight person, she is also strong with the kids in words. Her powers are also very interesting, like some really simple and fun tricks, and another thing that Harry Potter was inspired by this, is Mary Poppins handbag, where she just takes from there a lot of things that obviously won't fit in a small bag, that was so fun watch the kids trying to figure out what was going on, and even more fun than that was the measuring tape that said how the person is. You neve got to know what she really is, but that is so fantastic because she even says \"i neve explain myself\", because it don't really matter, it isn't why this is about.There are a few things that i think it could have been better done in this movie, wich is the fact, that the home that Mary Poppins ends up, isn't really a home with a disfunctional familly with a lot of problems, the father gets home singing in his first show up, so as the mother, her effect would have been better noticed in a home where things had a real struggle. There are some sequences that i didn't really felt, one or two moments that got me out of the story, but nothing that make the movie less magic.The fact that one of the places that they went in this movie, is inside of paintings made by Bert is awesome, because, you see, those paintings we can say that are from Bert's imagination, because that's from where comes all the things that are made, right ? So they literallty just jump inside of a dream, and when they got there, there are all cartoon, 2d animation, and that is just amazing, those 2d animation journeys always got me like a dream, and in here, when they mix up that, it is literally, they jumping into one and it is really magic, in a moment referencing Charlie Chaplin by the way.The musics in this movie are, pretty much, all very nice, some are really great and very creative, one thing that i believe gives it a lot of value, is that all the songs were made for the film, it isn't really a remake from another band that had this songs, they were made for this and that is awesome. The songs are so happy and sweet with the great voice by the actors, they are both so happy and they exude happiness all the time, the movie ends with you thinking that they are your friends already, waiting for the next meeting. The dance sections are also so fun, the dancing movies are so simply in a way that we can do to, specially in the cartoon moment, that was fun and sweet in this aspect as well.This movie is, for sure, very ludic, but you can notice a lot of adults talks in there as well, mainly when it is towards the end the situation with the father, that apparentely doesn't really know how to be a good one, his dialogues with the character of Bert, are really good and very deep, saying how it is supposed the relationship in the father perspective, time flies.Julie Andrews is fantastic, she is charming, serious, commander and very inspiring, she does have a lovely voice and a very nice spirit to dance. Dick Van Dyke is a man that is simply amazing, you end the movie wanting him to be your friend, he is so happy and simple, living the time of his life.",

Having said that, thesuitable for the occasion..Mary PoppinsThere are few sketchy overstretched musical sequences that; even though looks stunning and pleasing on terms of visual aspects, seems redundant and required better editing. Having said that, the choreography, background score, songs, costume design and production design are at their peak that speaks more than anything in here. Robert Stevenson is in his A game and doesn't fail on conveying the anticipated message to the audience. Julie Andrews is the genuinely the \"protagonist\" in this feature that needs no support as she carries it all off in her shoulder like a charm. Mary Poppins works particularly for its sensibility and simplicity of picking up a concept through something so common and mundane (like a tuppence) that it resonates and communicates with the audience in a click and still reach for more general and wider vision.",

Julie Andrews carries the film on her back thanks to the enormous talent she demonstrates every minute. She is truly great in the main character. Beside her, Dick Van Dyke is the strongest male character with a contagious joy. The script is very good and tells the story of an enchanted nanny who entertains and teaches two children, changing even the life of the whole family. The film is full of great songs that have become immortal and constitute one of the best movie soundtracks of all time. A great movie for the whole family, timeless and worthy of being on the shelf of any home.",

In contrast Mr Banks walking to his financial doom ties with Feed the Birds as the most moving scene of the film. It also teaches some nice family values as well. I highly recommend this film. 10/10, without a shadow of a doubt. Bethany Cox",

Sadly, upon re-watching this film again as an adult, thereOver 50 years later, \"Mary Poppins\" continues to be a childhood defining film for many people and it contains memorable scenes that will stick with them for the rest of their lives. Sadly, upon re-watching this film again as an adult, there are two big problems that undermine this classic Disney musical. First, the film has a pace that is a bit too slow. The runtime of the film is noticeably too long for what it is and therefore, spending less time holding onto some of the scenes would have been beneficiary for the viewing experience. Second, I really do not like the film's message and definition for what makes a perfect person. The word 'Perfect' is one without a definition. It is a loose and open word, just like the word 'normal', meaning that both words are interpreted as something completely different between one person to another. The film tries to nail home a definition for 'perfect' by constantly stroking the ego of its titular character, who herself gleefully enjoys every single compliment made to her, even when she is being strict. Gag me. Kids will need to take the film's message with a grain of salt and treat it more as a referential life lesson, NOT as a set-in-stone message. Despite those two nagging issues, I can't deny the rest of the work that was put into the film. The music/score, the songs, the vocal performances (most notably Julie Andrews), the visuals, the dance choreography, the animation, and just the sheer eccentricity of the film are all exceptional. They all work in tandem to create a road trip musical that manages to put a smile onto my face more than once and it reminds us all about the whimsical, magical moments we had when we were children. Those moments stemmed from the days we used our imaginations to create fantastical adventures of our own...and still do! Disney has too many great moments to count from its rich filmography and this film is home to a few of those moments. With that said, its slow pace and obnoxious presentation of a flawed message keep it from being a great film, but at least a good one.",
