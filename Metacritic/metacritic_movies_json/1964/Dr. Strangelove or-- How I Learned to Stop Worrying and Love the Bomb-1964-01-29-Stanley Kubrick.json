  "critic_reviews": [
    "Perhaps Kubrick's most perfectly realised film.",
    "Kubrick's great 1964 tragicomedy about superpowers on the nuclear brink continues to fascinate new generations of moviegoers, as its frequent reissues attest. A genuine classic.",
    "Kubrick’s remains perhaps the blackest comedy ever put on screen, and with Peter Sellers brilliantly playing multiple roles, the blackest, funniest movie of the post-war era.",
    "A masterpiece... The genius of Dr. Strangelove is that it's possible to laugh -- and laugh hard -- while still recognizing the intelligence and insight behind the humor.",
    "The film is a model of barely controlled hysteria in which the absurdity of hypermasculine Cold War posturing becomes devastatingly funny--and at the same time nightmarishly frightening in its accuracy.",
    "More lethal than a nuclear waste dump, Kubrick's komedy at least kills us with laughter... It's one of the greatest - and undoubtably the most hilarious - antiwar statements ever put to film.",
    "Seen after 30 years, Dr. Strangelove seems remarkably fresh and undated - a clear-eyed, irreverant, dangerous satire. And its willingness to follow the situation to its logical conclusion - nuclear annihilation - has a purity that today's lily-livered happy-ending technicians would probably find a way around.",
    "The hard-charging originality of the screenplay—the equivalent of turning \"The Hot Zone\" into a Farrelly comedy—suggests a deficient legacy of credit to Terry Southern's corner.",
    "Is Dr. Strangelove Kubrick's best movie? Along with ''Paths of Glory,\" absolutely.",
    "This landmark movie's madcap humor and terrifying suspense remain undiminished by time.",
    "It lampoons a crazed warmongering machismo that never goes out of style.",
    "Baleful and brilliant, Dr. Strangelove; Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, will outrage a predictable percentage of the population and enthrall an even greater percentage.",
    "Shooting Dr. Strangelove as if it were Paths Of Glory makes its ridiculous elements at once funnier and more chilling, emphasizing the Cold War’s inherent insanity.",
    "I can never watch it without a bowel-liquefaction of fear.",
    "Dr. Strangelove is unique as an American studio film in that nearly every scene addresses its alignment of military action with sexual impotence and bodily excretion. It’s possibly the filthiest studio comedy ever made, even though there isn’t a single gross-out gag, curse word, or graphic image in its entire running time.",
    "The collapse of the Cold War may have left Kubrick's satire on mutually assured destruction less relevant than it was, but it still features Peter Sellers' finest three performances as well as proving that the supposedly humourless Kubrick was up for a laugh.",
    "By a whopping margin, this is Kubrick’s most radical film and greatest dramatic gamble.",
    "Kubrick originally planned Dr. Strangelove as a straight drama. That he realized the absurdity of the whole thing is a testament to his intelligence; that he pulled it off so brilliantly is a testament to his talent.",
    "Kubrick’s film is the most accurate and timeless portrayal of a world facing mutually assured nuclear destruction, and paradoxically accomplishes this feat not through a realistic study but through the blackest surrealism.",
    "George C. Scott as the fiery Pentagon general who seizes on the crisis as a means to argue for total annihilation of Russia offers a top performance, one of the best in the film. Odd as it may seem in this backdrop, he displays a fine comedy touch.",
    "Yet some of the laughs come too easy and linger too long; for the film's message to have maximum impact, the laughter has to stick in your throat.",
    "The ultimate touch of ghoulish humor is when we see the bomb actually going off, dropped on some point in Russia, and a jazzy sound track comes in with a cheerful melodic rendition of \"We'll Meet Again Some Sunny Day.\" Somehow, to me, it isn't funny. It is malefic and sick.",
    "After suffering through two screenings of Dr. Strangelove, I would sooner drink hemlock.... To me, Dr. Strangelove is an evil thing about an evil thing; you will have to make up your own mind about it."

A lone general gone mad gives the green light launching an A-Bomb attack on Russia, and the President now (Sellers) must pull out all the stops to prevent this. This dark comedy is shot entirely in black and white with terrific production design. Astutely, Kubrick focuses on the actual nuclear event in itself, thus removing the issues of foreign politics. The films message simply put its this; man is not at the mercey of machines,but it in fact it's just the opposite. Petter Sellers is sensational playing several roles and the film has stood the test of time remaining undated.",

Dr Strangelove himself only appears in the latter half of the film but god does Peter Sellers do a good job! In all 3 of his roles. It's a pity everyone knows the ending though because it's been done to death in popular culture (Along with the famous line \"Mein Fuhrer! I can walk!\" one of the funniest in history. However I will say the 5 minutes before the famous segment with major Kong is i think one of the best 5 minutes in cinematic history, especially with the countdown, of sorts. It is truly one of the most tense few minutes I've ever seen and the acting is brilliant! The look on their faces as they approach the target in almost too real.

I really wanted to love this movie, but it did kind of disappointed me. Here's the thing, the movie looks great on a technical level, Peter Sellars and George C. Scott are great in the movie, some of the war scenes looked really amazing, and it's funny at parts. However, I wasn't interested the rest of the characters aside from Sellars multiple performances and Scott's performance. I wasn't that too invested in the story until about halfway through. And there were parts that I simply did not laugh at. The movie, to me, only felt like it was suppose to be a comedy at parts. The rest felt to me that it was suppose to be drama. I guess the structure didn't feel like a true comedy to me. But like I said, the second half is what ultimately drew me into the story. I know lots of people love this political comedy, but personally it didn't work to its full benefit like I hoped it would. Overall, even with its lack in structure, the movie slowly builds to become more engaging the further you get into it even if it feels too late. I'll give \"Dr. Strangelove\" a B-!",

To understand Dr. Strangelove you have to understand a Cold War era when the likelihood of nuclear holocaust seemed imminent and anti-Communist paranoia was still running very high. You think Sarah Palin is bad? The script savagely lampoons the real post-McCarthy wing-nuttery of the age, from anti-fluoridation reactionary groups like the John Birch Society to real nuclear war advocates speaking flippantly of maximum body counts during a full-scale nuclear war. The script roasts them all and takes a good wide swing at a few other soft spots in American society -- the use of Nazi scientists (we got to the moon on the shoulders of non other than Verner von Braun's leadership), the anti-commie paranoia that bordered on psychosis (the McCarthy era was pretty bad), the euphemistic \"Peace is Our Profession\" whitewash of the DOD (which led us to millions of deaths in S.E. Asia) and so on. Strangelove takes it to the logical extreme in a sarcastic - even jugular - vein, demonstrating the inanity of anti-fluoridation paranoia via a psychotic general admitting his withholding ejaculation in defense of his precious bodily fluids. This is examined in relation to fluoridation and the various epigrammatic phrases peace on earth, preserve our essences and purity of essence also revealing to us the acronymic three-letter cipher prefix necessary to cancel the attack.",

The film depicts an unbalanced General Jack D. Ripper, who has sent his squadron of B-52 bombers to attack their designated targets inside Russia, having forged orders from Washington. Once the government finds out, they convene to figure out how to stop the General and return the bombers from of enemy territory. If they do not succeed, they are faced with the terrible power of the Doomsday Device. A weapon that's soul purpose is mutually assured destruction. I could see that as a plausible thriller. Instead, Kubrik took the film another direction saying, \"After all, what could be more absurd than the very idea of two mega powers willing to wipe out all human life because of an accident, spiced up by political differences that will seem as meaningless to people a hundred years from now as the theological conflicts of the Middle Ages appear to us today.\" Perhaps what is darkest about this comedy is just how plausible it was becoming in it's day. Made in 1964, the country was tense and in mourning. Only 2 years previously, the United States had looked down the barrel of total nuclear commitment during the Cuban Missile Crisis. And it was still reeling over the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The only certainty was that nothing was certain. What began as fanciful musing became a question of: \"What if\"? The film was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor for Peter Sellers. Peter Sellers gives an impressive performance as not only one character, but as three: British officer Mandrake, Predsident Muffly, and Dr. Strangelove. His performance is so well done that the casual movie goer would most likely never know he plays all three parts. If you are into Kubrik, dark comedies, or just good cinema then check this out.",

But perhaps his best of the three is the titular character Dr. Strangelove, a former Nazi scientist who aides the current President of the United States, Merkin Muffley (also played by Sellers) on the basis of the film, where a crazed general (George C. Scott) initiates a first stike nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, something which everyone else is now attempting to prevent as this will mean nuclear annihilation.\rThe simplicity of the comedy in Dr. Strangelove is visible from the beginning, it isn't a complex plot of drawn out jokes and cringeworthy gags, but the expressions, motions and general dialogue of the characters that truly make it a special film, it doesn't have spectacular special effects nor does it have visually striking sets, but its simplicity is its greatest weapons, because all it needs is the correct characters and you have a winner, the easiest way to make people laugh is turning a serious situation on its head which really shouldn't be funny, but human nature wins out over morals.\rIts ironic that a film like this should be so highly praised, but yet probably wouldn't last in todays current climate of happy endings and learnt lessons, we have a very pure and a very real outcome of what the film sets out to do, director and writer Stanley Kubrick proves that he was one of the most iconic and inspirational filmmakers of all time by turning his hand to a comedy, especially with a subject so fresh at the time of filming. He proves that laughter can be found in the most unlikely of places, especially when we have a very character driven story which throws perspective after perspective, we see a more subdued side when we are in the  of the B52s, yet in the infamous 'War Room' we have much more insanity laced and lighter atmosphere.\rDr. Strangelove is a true timeless classic and a fantastic film, it pushed the boundaries of what was funny and what was satire, and came out throwing all the punches, equalling to a dazzling display of excellent performances and some of the funniest moments and quotes to come out of the cinema.",

Under the cold war backdrop, a rogue nuclear attack to Soviet Union commenced by a fervid anti-communist USA general, which would (irrevocably) launch a doomsday machine (a Soviet Union’s ultimate self-destructive nuclear contraption), and would annihilate all the human beings on the earth. It may sounds ridiculous and far-fetched by the mass, Kubrick’s masterful endeavor has overcome the detached accessibility of the warfare lingoes and the exclusivity of the decision-makers’ political impasse to implement a stranger-than-fiction satire which grants a considerable closeness to its audience with ease.  Running within 100 minutes, the film slickly unreels its storyline with great force of dark humor which imbues parodic and even cartoonish idiosyncrasies to the permeating machismo in the air.  Peter Sellers’ three-faceted versatility, George C. Scott’s Communism-slamming extravaganza and Sterling Hayden’s trigger-happy paranoia plus Slim Pickens’ cowboy hat, the ensemble cast owns their respective frantic glory within a compacted steak of time, umpteen gags and mockeries can be savored ad infinitum, Sellers’British accent (as Group Captain) when confronting Sterling’s General Rippers is unimpeachably spontaneous, Keenan Wynn’s coca-cola joke is pertinently deadpan serious and Sterling’s conspiracy theory about water fluoridation and the fearful deprivation of life essence during a sexual intercourse (the man just cannot face his natural aging mechanism of the body) are plainly golden ideas, outlandish but vividly rib-tickling, and astringently self-reflective.\r Kubrick’s trademark set design which would prevail in his later color features has not  fully exploited this black-and-white war farce, and the (not-too-obvious) misogyny and chauvinism overtone does impede the sensitive nerves a bit, nevertheless, it is not my favorite Kubrick’s film, but it is an outstanding comedy which I presume can stay untainted by numerous re-watches, for me the first round is more than gratifying and since my generally inert resistance towards war-related films, a second round may take some time despite of its overall peerlessness.",

This is one of the shortest Kubrick films and probably the most casual to watch which I like. There is a lot of dialogue but it gets pretty entertaining in the second half of the film. And there are a couple of really funny scenes; my highlight is the one where the President is on the phone trying to tell the Russian leader that American planes are going to bomb Russia. And what makes it great also is the comment it makes. This is one of THE cold war films. All the paranoia and suspicion and madness. The ending was the right way to end the film.

The film was a spoof of the entire American special forces, and their protocols. Dr. Strangelove was a wittyOut of one of the most tense times in U.S. history came one of the more crude and witty satires on the U.S. approach and policies. The film was a spoof of the entire American special forces, and their protocols. Dr. Strangelove was a witty satire of the paranoia towards communism, the overly complex emergency protocols, and the U.S. special forces leadership. It was also most likely a film that would predict the future culture of america.\rIn the mid 1960’s, when Dr. Strangelove came out, respect for the government was paramount to the masses, this trust would be violated just a few years later with the war of vietnam. Looking at that maybe it’s best to say Dr. Strangelove was slightly ahead of it’s time, and maybe it even helped shape the future cultures opinions. Either way the irreverence that Dr. Strangelove showed towards the U.S. politicians and special forces was at the time, controversial, mostly because the most accepted idea was that these people and institutions were off limits.\rThe film was brimming with irony, most likely symbolizing that Kubrick felt the cold war, and paranoia had an ironic air to it. The film seems to reinforce that Kubrick thought the whole situation was ridiculous, and the irony of the hysteria wasn’t lost on Kubrick either. There are examples of this littered throughout the film, and Kubrick obviously found something funny about it all, it’s easy to look back and laugh, but at the time this film was bold, because it was as scary as it was funny to those watching it.\rAs was mentioned earlier the film’s cornerstone is the ironic humor, for example the ironic scoring. Kubrick was a master of using music to further his movie, especially in 2001: A Space Odyssey, but in this instance the music was an extension of Kubrick’s opinions. Used brilliantly the music had a peaceful scariness, as soft melodic music plays over bomb carriers flying through the sky. Another element Kubrick wouldn’t shy away from, especially with irony, was the overly masculine posturing of both countries.\rIrony was also used to satirize the U.S. leadership, often showing the irony of the special forces. Good examples of this are the poster reading “Peace is our Profession”, or Slim Picken’s talking about promotions as they unknowingly go rogue, or the most famous quote of the film “Gentlemen you can’t fight here, this is the war room.” All of these are great examples of the overly militarized society that we were living in, something Kubrick must have hated.\rComing at a time of change for the country, and possibly helping that change happen Kubrick boldly satirized one of the most respected organizations in the United States with reckless abandon. However, maybe in doing so gave the country exactly what it needed, a vehicle to laugh and poke fun at how ridiculous the countries were acting. Considering the opinions of culture towards the military, and other satirized organizations, it seems obvious that Dr. Strangelove was drastically ahead of it’s time.",

Without a doubt, one of those is Stanley Kubrik's 1964 masterpiece, Dr. Strangelove (or, as it's subtitled, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb). As political satire, few movies -- even those as incisive as the hilariously vicious 1992 release Bob Roberts -- come close to this level of accomplishment. In the case of Dr. Strangelove, the barbs and quips (both subtle and obvious) hold up as well today as they did thirty years ago.\r When director Stanley Kubrick decided to adapt Peter George's thriller Red Alert for the screen, he recruited the author to help with the script. Instead of retaining the straight tone of the book, Kubrick wanted to try for a black comedy, and with the complicity of George and co-writer Terry Southern, Dr. Strangelove was born.\r Originally, Kubrick envisioned Peter Sellers playing four unique roles. However, after filming three of them (President Merkin Muffley, RAF Group Captain Mandrake, and ex-Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove), the actor broke his leg and was unable to complete the quartet. In his place, Slim Pickens was signed to portray Major \"King\" Kong. Other cast members include George C. Scott as General Buck Turgidson, Sterling Hayden as General Jack D. Ripper, and James Earl Jones (in his first film role) as Lieutenant Lothar Zogg.\r As a story chronicling the potential countdown to humanity's end in a nuclear fireball, Dr. Strangelove is tightly-plotted and well-paced. As a black comedy, wielding a wit sharper than honed steel, the film is unparalleled. Kubrick's picture has so many targets that it's difficult to know where to begin. Certainly, the \"balance of power\" nuclear deterrent policy gets the most obvious jabs (although ardent supporters may not see this -- Dr. Strangelove's attacks are subtle enough that it's possible for an unsophisticated viewer to miss the point). Parodying the \"missile gap\" at the heart of the arms race, we are given the \"doomsday gap\" and the \"mine shaft gap.\"\r Kubrick isn't especially kind to the military mentality, as personified by General Turgidson (elements of Scott's performance here foreshadow how he would approach the role of Patton in the 1970 movie that earned him an Oscar). Turgidson sees Soviet plots everywhere, flirts with a girlfriend in the midst of a national crisis, believes 10-20 million American casualties (tops!) are acceptable, and wishes the U.S. had some sort of doomsday machine to match the Russians' capabilities.\r As the film races to its conclusion, situations become more bizarre, with a drunk Soviet Premier Kissoff whining over the phone to Muffley that the U.S. planes are flying too low and jamming his radar. Mandrake tries to put an emergency call through to the President, but the Pentagon won't accept the collect call, and he doesn't have exact change. And Dr. Strangelove, Hitler's best living ally, comes up with a plan to preserve the superior elements of humanity.\r The genius of Dr. Strangelove is that it's possible to laugh -- and laugh hard -- while still recognizing the intelligence and insight behind the humor. The film is always saying something, and a viewer would have to be deaf and blind not to recognize the targets of the sarcasm. In fact, I'd worry about anyone who takes this movie too seriously. That, after all, isn't the kind of person Dr. Strangelove is aimed for; it's the kind this film takes aim at.",

I liked how the various people, representing different aspects of the US (the military etc.) and other nationalities, are put together in close quarters in the war room, which inevitably lead to some clashes. This isn't the sort of film that offers lots of immediate laughs but I appreciated the quirky characters and there are certainly some rather amusing pieces of dialogue, one famous quote being 'Gentlemen, you can't fight in here, this is the war room!'. I found the phone calls made by various officials particularly amusing. One conversation features an official arguing with the person on the other end of the line that 'I'm capable of being just as sorry as you are' and consequently going off in a huff. There is a pointed sense of immaturity portrayed in the way that such people communicate with one another, which makes you think about the potential childishness, the one up-man ship aspect of war and of political confrontation generally I suppose. I found it somehow amusing that one of the characters kept referring to the Russians as the 'Ruskies'.I liked the various characters played by Peter Sellers. His characters are, unsurprisingly, quite comical in tone and have an edge of caricature about them. The film has a serious theme (the threat of nuclear war) and it does well at making us think what could happen. It has some distinctly comic moments within the script but it also poses some important questions, makes the viewer see the somewhat sinister side of megalomania and its certainly decent as a piece of thought provoking cinema. The fact its filmed in black and white is also quite well judged, I feel, as it gives it an almost timeless feel to it. The film dates from the mid 1960s, when most films were shot in colour as standard and given the very modern danger that was an all out nuclear war, at the time this film was made and initially released, its perhaps ironic that its shown in a normally quite dated way but it does give it a timeless feel somehow.The plot is a bit meandering and it won't appeal to everyone but I'm glad I've seen it twice now as I feel I appreciate it more now and the first time I saw it, I really wasn't in the mood for this type of film (political satire) and indeed I stopped watching after half an hour or so. Given I saw the drama show Catch 20 recently, I could see some similarities and perhaps better understand where its coming from.I would recommend this to people in the mood for such a film, not an all out laugh a minute comedy or a light and easy watch as such and not for people hoping for constant fast paced action or war scenes but otherwise its a cult classic that I'd say is worth a watch.",
