  "critic_reviews": [
    "Yes, it is derivative, but in a year in which films from the 1980s are getting needless remakes seemingly every other week, this one stands out as a rare one that works. That's a good \"Thing.\"",
    "While I wish van Heijningen's Thing weren't quite so in lust with the '82 model, it works because it respects that basic premise. And it exhibits a little patience, doling out its ickiest, nastiest moments in ways that make them stick.",
    "It's a solid, entertaining monster movie that, at its best, recalls not only its three decades-old namesake but Alien as well.",
    "I'm delighted to tell you that the new Thing was made by people who understand what the horror audience wants and don't treat it like a bunch of brain-dead children. Mirabile freakin' dictu.",
    "A solid sci-fi/horror hybrid, but this iceman doesn't deliver enough to chew on.",
    "It's no great thing, just a better Thing than expected.",
    "The basic story is identical, and when there are fraught, climactic opportunities for the movie to make a gutsy departure, it passes up the chance.",
    "This version of The Thing, directed by Matthijs van Heijningen Jr., provides such graphic and detailed views of the creature that we are essentially reduced to looking at special effects, and being aware that we are. Think how little you ever really saw in the first \"Alien\" movie, and how frightening it was.",
    "As written by Eric Heisserer (Final Destination 5), the new Thing lacks much wit or self-awareness. It's more of a \"final girl\" formula film, but on ice. Still, why did it take 29 years to create this solid double-feature? And will they unfreeze Russell for a trilogy?",
    "These filmmakers got halfway there, but Carpenter's genius was about more than just a look.",
    "In terms of scares, this old-fashioned Thing is better than most new things.",
    "The other thing The Thing has got going for it is a welcome hint of dour Scandinavian sensibility sneaked in by director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. whenever there's a pause in the unexceptional antics of aliens consuming humans.",
    "Fails to replicate Carpenter's blue-collar humor or carefully modulated suspense.",
    "Misshapen, malodorous and firing its grubby tentacles across the room in a feeding frenzy, The Thing reminded me of a roomful of journalists immediately after someone announces Open Bar. The movie's victims disappear like cocktail peanuts and without a whole lot more significance.",
    "Part horror film, part space thriller and all gore-fest, the movie ends up being a lot like its protagonist: a mess of a monster that stretches itself too thin to scare much.",
    "It's an imperfect facsimile, guilty of borrowing too many ideas from the earlier film, and then executing them with differing results.",
    "One gut-busting death after another, terror giving way to tedium. Your call.",
    "The best thing about The Thing, the third - and the least interesting - big-screen adaptation of the John W. Campbell Jr. short story \"Who Goes There?\", is its closing credits.",
    "You can tell a lot about the film from its rough handling of the materials supplied by its predecessor, using these commonalities both to identify the bond between the two and signal how much further it's willing to push things.",
    "Heijningen doesn't display the instinct of the best Hollywood action directors to give the audience what it craves at the big moments, except for a few gory in-your-face shots.",
    "Far less chilling than versions from 1951 and 1982, Universal's latest take on The Thing at least has a strong lead thesp in Mary Elizabeth Winstead, recruited for the studio's bid to turn a tale of ice-cold macho paranoia into a beauty-vs.-beast shocker a la \"Alien.\"",
    "Heijningen's The Thing is tightly paced, has enough imaginative horror to satisfy even the most jaded gorehound, and never strays too far from its source, so why do you come away from it feeling like it was the runner-up in a daylight nightmare festival?",
    "While this version, listed as a \"prequel,\" has a few gross-out moments, it lacks any sense of warmth. Which might be an odd criticism of a horror movie set in Antarctica, but there you have it.",
    "There are some body-horror gross-outs if you're into that sort of thing, but mostly what you get are a bunch of too-obvious leftovers from the \"Alien\" stockroom, including a selection of moist innards, slimy tendons, dripping fangs and the like.",
    "For a film that takes place in such a cold locale, it all feels awfully warmed-over.",
    "This debut feature from Matthijs van Heijningen is as stiff as the Antarctic tundra. Where the earlier film pulsed with precisely calibrated paranoia and distinctly drawn characters, this inarticulate replay unfolds as mechanistically as a video game.",
    "Offers audiences a similar-but-not-the-same mix of effects, existentialism and creepy body horror while forgetting the things like character, humor and tension that made Carpenter's take on the same material so memorable past the initial fearsome fluid flesh sequences.",
    "There is absolutely nothing in this prequel/remake that improves on the first film or negates it in any way. If you've never seen The Thing - and you really should - stick with the genuine 1982 article and skip this elaborate act of mimicry.",
    "Here's the thing about the new The Thing. It isn't as satisfying as the old \"The Thing.\" And it's nowhere near as enthralling as the vintage \"Thing,\" which inspired every other \"Thing\" to follow.",
    "It's an infuriatingly static picture - actors walking around when they should be running, ruminating when they should be panicking, generally failing to convey fear and pick up the pace.",
    "This Thing is purely for the gorehounds, and they aren't likely to leave impressed."

From the reviews I had seen I was expecting a lazy rehash of the original but instead found a gut wrenching, highly convincing prequel that is equal to if not better than the original. Sure it isn't particularly unique, reusing general horror clichÃ©s and positively bursting with generic 'jump' moments, but the convincing and actually quite disturbing monster design and well structured storyline (though you can rule out any concept of character development) ends up in not just a watchable but highly enjoyable thriller. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the original or who enjoys some good old thrills and spills.",

While it discards the paranoia and careful considerations of the 1982 version, it instead chooses to create a sense of tension and urgency with even greater effectiveness. While some of the side characters could have used some work, the main characters were likable and sensible (A rare quality in a horror movie). The characters are as quick on the uptake as the audience, and the Thing, while showing less forethought than the 1982 version, is still incredibly intelligent and, most importantly, scary. Mary Elizabeth Winstead in particular gave a stunning performance. Along with some problems with minor characters seemingly existing only to be killed/assimilated is the issue of CG simply not being up to the standard of the old models used by the original movie. While the 1982 version is still king, the prequel is definitely a must-see.",

That's all II really enjoyed this movie. It constantly maintained a certain level in intrigue that kept me interested to the very end, and even managed to go someplace I didn't expect for this kind of horror movie: inside of a space ship. That's all I should tell you about that subject, don't want to actually spoil anything. But anyways, aside from going to awesome and unexpected locations, the movie also is dark and shocking. After an expedition digs up a frozen alien body from the ice of the arctic, they accidentally unleash an alien disease that soon reveals itself to be a possessive and imitative method for the alien's reproduction cycle. Now, I know what you're thinking, that it's just another science fictiony zombie movie. Actually, it's nothing like that. I can't go into any more detail without spoilers, but I can tell you that the horror subject matter is unique enough from other sci fi horror franchises that it most definitely can be considered (reasonably) original. I liked how the plot developed, I like how nightmarish and dark the movie eventually turned out to be, and I especially like the direction it went in the climax. If you're completely new to The Thing franchise, definitely give this movie a watch. And even if you've seen the previous movies, I'd say this one's still worth your time.",

There are complaints about the monsters being in CGI. If the monsters were to be achieved by highly detailed models they may have looked way too comical to be scary if they were to move. ... To get a decent scary looking monster that doesn't look comical when it moves takes a lot of time, effort and money, possibly a hell of a lot more than a CGI beasty would take to make. ... The CGI doesn't look bad, there's been a lot worse in the past and these certainly don't deserve the bad rep the paid critics are giving them. I would say the CGI beasties deserve a bit more attention into their incorporation into the movie. something about them makes them stand out and only makes them a little obvious at times. ...

Before I mention the good parts of it though, I gotta mention the bad. One bad thing about the movie was the lack of suspense it offered. It's not a gorefest like some critics are saying, but it is more violent than the 1982 version and because the violence increased the suspense decreased. Simple movie facts. Also, as the movie trailer shows, the creature pops out of the ice in plain sight. If the movie was more about suspense and less about violence, like John Carpenter's film was, it would've definitely received more praise from critics. Another problem the film had was the lack of character development for a lot of the characters. You really felt like you knew the majority of the characters in the 1982 Thing, but the characters started dying so fast in this film, you were really only well acquainted with a few select characters. Finally, the last thing wrong with the movie was the lack of tension. John Carpenter's characters acted very appropriate for a situation like that. \"Stay away from me or I'll kill you.\" This is totally understandable and probable for people to act any these circumstances. The characters just didn't seem afraid of each other even after they grasped that ANY of them could be the thing, even when they'd separate off into groups. The good parts of the movie were good CGI, staying true to the story of the 1982 movie and tying both movies together well, and overall a very good cast with good acting. Overall the movie was much better than the average critic is rating it, but because it isn't an original idea, and it's not a phenomenal movie, the critic will want to slam it. Point being, it's a good movie, as you can see from the 7.8 user score from 33 users 30 of them being positive. Go see it. If you haven't seen either of the thing's before it, you will really enjoy, and if you have, you will still enjoy a modern view of a classic.",

The 2011 prequel to John Carpenter's classic Science Fiction film THE THING is surprisingly well-made, and serves as a valid companion piece to the original film by filling in the events that preceded it. Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. and his team of set designers have taken great care in recreating the Norwegian base camp and following the frightful events just as they had been described in the previous film. The one major disadvantage that anyone would come to expect falls in the special effects department. Rob Bottin's ground-breaking make-up designs have terrified audiences since 1982, but the computerized monstrosities found here lose much of their effect despite their nasty appearances. Although THE THING presents several new twists on the plot points from before, the plagiarized ideas border quite closely to making this a direct remake. Mary Elizabeth Winstead and her supporting cast do maintain the proper amount of fear and paranoia to make this a successful sequel/prequel/remake, whatever it may be.",

The director had a tough task of both borrowing elements from Carpenter's film and staying close to the basic structure and story, but also making it new and different, so that fans of the 1982 film would want to watch this one and not see a less-good exact copy. I think the director pulled this off fairly well. He found the right balance between old and new imo. I won't go into detail about exactly what was old-ish and new-ish in the movie, as this might be kind of a spoiler and ruin your experience a little bit (if you're reading this and have not seen this movie). Now, let's talk more about this movie. The cast does a good job and the performances are mostly convincing. A bit more character development would not have hurt, though. The tone of the movie (music, atmosphere, tension), while not as effective as the 1982 film, is still there and works quite well. The story, plot, and especially the pacing was handled really well imo. Speaking about plot, there are some plot holes and illogical situations in the movie, which at times took me a bit out of the movie. The creature designs were cool, but they are mostly CGI, and while the CGI is fine for the most part, it relies a bit too much on it, and in a few scenes it looks rather bad. The CGI was especially noticeable in the end, and even though I liked the ending into the credits, the 5-10 minutes before that was handled a bit sloppily and was quite predictable. My main complaints of this movie are the lack of character development, the over-reliance on CGI, some plot holes/illogical situations, and the 5-10 minutes before the ending credits. But, overall this movie is as I said before, a good movie. I recommend it both to the fans of John Carpenter's 1982 The Thing so that they can see what happened before that movie, and to the people who have not seen that movie, so that they can first watch this one, then watch Carpenter's :)",

I loathe remakes, I think they're unoriginal, insulting and a waste of time - however, this originally pulled me in, and I liked the notion that they wouldn't try and completely copy one of the best horror films of all time, (John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" is second only to the best horror film of all time, \"Alien\"), and instead try and fit in with the story. However, this film tries to copy the original, (and yes I realize Carpenter's was a remake of \"The Thing from Another World,\" which itself was a screen adaptation of \"Who Goes There?\" but Carpenters still stands as superior). We get scenes of testing to see who is an alien, but instead of a logical blood test they have a \"filling test\" wherein if someone doesn't have fillings, it automatically makes them an alien. As well plot holes abounded, the lead actress was mediocre, (especially when acting with an amazing supporting cast), and the tension rises but never reaches a real climax. In addition, it's sad when a remake has poorer FX than the 1982 film it's based off of... But that in and of itself says something about CGI versus real effects. Overall, it could have been a rare remake/sequel that could have been at least fun and entertaining. This is boring, gross and most of all - mediocre. Don't waste your time.",

After reading about Heijningen archeological approach to making this prequel I was exited to see his film.   Unfortunately this movie suffers from hasty pacing, poor character development and insulting plot holes.  Unlike Carpenter's Thing, this creature attacks without provocation, often at times that are not in it's best interest for survival.  Early on in the film The Thing causes a fully operational helicopter to crash while it is on board and it's host isn't even suspected.  Good job Heijningen.  I won't go into the other numerous & obvious plot holes out of respect for those who want to see this movie.  Another disappointing feature of this prequel is that for all the effort that is put into making it congruent with Carpenter's movie, they change some very obvious events for no good or interesting reason. Remember watching the Norwegians using thermite charges to blow away the ice from the wrecked spaceship in Carpenter's movie? Thats not what happens in this prequel.  I'm giving this movie a 4 because it does have some redeeming qualities.  There is an amusing part where you get to hear The Thing observe the main protagonists cleverness.  Also, whoever worked on The Thing's design put a lot of love into making it look great.  Ultimately though this is just not the thinking persons Thing, for that stick with Carpenter.",

In this case The Thing is one of my favorites and the script, setting, creature, etc is just pristine. Seeing this prequel, I went in with skepticism because a lot of the time these films are harsh knock offs copying from the original. Well it does in some places but changes the subjects it gets it right, plays it safe, which is good because the original is a classic. Script is of course weak, weaker then the original but turned out to be excellent, well done special effects and creepy atmosphere. I really liked Mary Elizabeth.. I thought by the end she almost came off as a Ripley like character. Hoping it does well enough to get a sequel to that side of the story. I won't spoil anything but the ending I really enjoyed.. too many happy endings nowadays but this one was good. My brother and I enjoyed it so much might just see it again. My only points would be to improve the script, give Mary more speaking parts and maybe flesh her out a bit more.. only disappointment was the final creature, just was silly having the guys face plastered over it.. but just a nit pick more then anything.

I am a huge fan of the previous two iterations of this movie.  That being said, I thought this was a pretty decent addition to the franchise.  it wasn't amazing, but it didn't suck either.  I can definitely see that Matthijs van Heijningen is a meticulous fan of the John Carpenter version.  His attention to detail is really quite stunning.  Mary Elizabeth Winstead is very good in this.  I think she probably is a far better actress than the script allowed her to be. Can't wait to see what she pops up in next. The Thing itself was technically good.  Nice and creepy, but still \"computer creepy\". There really is no substitute for real goddamn make up effects and prosthetics.  There is nothing as scary as Rick Baker's dog transformation scene, in the 82 version, in this movie.  Why?  Because it was really there, and you got the added benefit of an actor truly interacting with something terrifying. I digress. Also, design-wise, it seems to me that too many people in the CG world are being pooped out on a conveyor belt, thinking that in order to make something creepy, you just need to throw tentacles, a crab claw, and a lamprey mouth on it.  These are all terrestrial structures (as in, found here, on Earth).  The Thing is an alien. See the problem? The Rick Baker stuff uses all of that imagery too, but there's a whole lot more imagination going on there.  Aspects of this Thing's creature design seemed culled directly from a Resident Evil game. Some have brought up the tired old, \"Americans don't do subtitles\", or the even more specious, \"All Norwegians look a like\" crap, but none of that is responsible for my blasÃ© score.  It is more based on a lack of design creativity, some cumbersome dialog, and some awkward direction, that really prevented this from being the home run it should of been.  Did I have fun watching it?  You bet your ass I did.  Would I watch it again?  If it was on TV I would.

The paleontologist scientist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), American pilot Sam Carter (Joel Edgerton), and other scientists play by many roles that are from Norweigian. The actors did pretty well, but Winstead did very good as the scientist and I like it when she's brave while she using the flamethrower to melt the aliens.

And the scares are well-timed and effectively built up with suspense.  That is not to say this film is as good as the original (it isn't).  But it is a clever companion piece to Carpenter's near masterpiece from 1982.  Most fans of the original will appreciate this one, and will enjoy spotting things as they fall into place.

The answer cannot be for nostalgic fans of John Carpenter's film, as they will not in any way be satisfied with this monstrosity. So perhaps it is being made for new horror fans that may have missed out on the 'original'.

All of the tension and psychological fear is replaced with contradiction and inconsistency, and the memorable characters and brutally shocking Thing encounters are replaced with walking monster fodder and CGI assery. Nothing in this film makes the slightest bit of sense, and what is perhaps the most unbelievably DISASTROUS alteration to the formula is just how aware everyone is to the existence of an alien being. The movie's plot relies on the idea that The Thing is nothing more than a bug from Outer Space.

I am a HUGE; I MEAN HUGE fan of the \"The Thing\" both the 1950's \"The Thing Form Another World\" and MY ALL TIME FAVORITE \"John Carpenters The Thing\". Both of which put you in a situationNow my friends I am going to be very frank with you. I am a HUGE; I MEAN HUGE fan of the \"The Thing\" both the 1950's \"The Thing Form Another World\" and MY ALL TIME FAVORITE \"John Carpenters The Thing\". Both of which put you in a situation where you can do nothing but sit and wait for death or do everything in your power to stop it. The 1950's the thing was much different then John carpenters and in all fairness was the best of the three. The black and white set for a creepy yet realistic feel making you visualize most of the gruesome and scientific aspects on your own; where as the John Carpenters The thing was a survival horror in which you can put yourself in the shows of the amazing R. J. Mcready (aka Kurt \"Motherfucking\" Russle. It gave you beautiful visuals, plausible science banter, and the fear of the unknown. This movie failed in every area its predecessors amazed. \"The Thing\" in this movie felt more like a necromorph from the fantastic survival horror Dead Space and is not as appealing. The story seems to push its self through rather then flow as John Carpenters did and did not allow for great character development like the 1950's original did. The characters seem like actors and not like people at all in the sense that you can tell this is a movie. The plot is filled with holes and seems like he had great ideas that didn't really link so he just put bits and pieces together to  try and make it flow but it was truly just all over the place and unequivocally bland. For those of us who have seen the two predecessor's in there glory know that what made us so enthralled with the cinematic extravaganza wast he fact that the alien was unpredictable; and in John Carpenters case the unknowing of who or what the creature was or its origin was just amazing and full of spontaneity. This was not achieved in the new version and kills the movie right from the start. From the start you know the alien has a form. This in its self left me with a retched feeling that the rest of the movie the alien will not think analytically, showing its superior knowledge, but that it is thinking more forceful and bold leaving no startling shocking feeling but instead you get a mundane adrenaline like nausea that you would rather skip then continue on with. The movie is no Alfred **** or Guillermo Del Toro master piece and is not even worth paying twenty dollars for the blu-ray with a digital copy. this movie is the type you rent because you watched everything else on netflix or one of those movies you can pick up for five dollars at from a college student with a stand trying to sell dvds for money in Manhattan. I am both appalled they would butcher my favorite movie, but i am even more furious that they would dare, I MEAN DARE, try to link this to the John Carpenters version by trying to tie in Kurt Russel in a sequel or trilogy. This is movie for people with a low IQ and who care very little for the science fiction genre and just watch to see an \"Alien\". Skip this if you watched the predecessors they are WAY WAY BETTER and deserve more effort to watch then this garbage. Skip this if you just want a new movie and want to experience a good sci-fi because this if far from good and i can suggest way better movies for cheaper like IRobot, Gattaca, or The Fifth Element. Stay way from this if you are even given it for free because it is a glimpse of what will come in the future. That no matter how much the budgets have grown by, and how advanced the technology may be that is utilized, that in the end movies such as this atrocity are  going to be made because consumers are dumber, easier to please, and easily manipulated. All those foolish neanderthals who thought this was good have no credibility with me and obviously have no taste. Its true some people are just harsh and most people are looking for simplicity, but my friends use your minds and see this in nothing short of crap. In the words of my lord James Rolfe (aka the Angry Video Game Nerd) \"WHAT WERE THEY THINKING\"",

A very worthy prequel indeed! I just think to many people are trying to toss the two films into competition, when the production and development teams themselves have stated they were not attempting to \"beat\" carpenters masterpiece, but fill in the blanks and give a very detailed back story.\r Carpenters version is thriller, panic, and group fear with some action.\r STRIKE's version was action, chaos, anxiety and the tragedy that occurred leading up to the events of Carpenters with a far more descriptive background on the thing itself... yet still not unveiling all the secrets of this unusual alien monster.\r And for the effort, and one happy fan, I still say it deserves right around a 9/10. Especially considering prequels and additions and remakes today... this one stands out like the \"dawn of the dead\" STRIKE update.\r Very entertaining, and the ending scene during the credits really reached out and touched my nostalgic heart... the crowd actually cheered.

To my delight, the film was actually pretty decent and goes along with the origal film rather nicely, aside from some glaring plot holes that don't match up with the first film. The entire acting crew does a marvelous job and the special effects are pretty nice. The film only slightly treads on rehashing scenes of the first film, the spots are few but are painfully obvious to fans. Thankfully the film forges new material on the creature, giving it a uniqueness from its predecessor. The main difference with this Thing is that it's more of a monster flick than the suspenseful horror that Carpenter delivered. It's definitely faster paced and ends sooner than you may want to, at least for me as I was really enjoying it. Hopefully we'll see an extended director's cut that delves more into suspense and story that may have been cut out. For fans of the first film, the final ending scenes are the most spectacular in linking directly into the opening of the first Thing. Recommended for horror/sci-fi fans!",

It was oft-speculated thatAfter the success of a videogame based on the original film, rumors of a sequel arose many times but never came to fruition, with creative differences between Universal and John Carpenter cited as the main reason. It was oft-speculated that Carpenter made a deal to write and produce a sequel provided he got to name has director. But when he opted to name himself director the studio balked and the project fell apart. In the aftermath, rumors of a miniseries on the SyfY channel arose along with the possibility of retelling the story with 20-somethings on a tropical island but (thankfully) they never saw the light of day. Rather than do a sequel or remake, Universal opted to jump start the franchise with a prequel that covers the events leading up to the John Carpenter film. It is set in 1982 at a Norwegian research station in Antarctica shortly before the scientists make an amazing discovery. When they uncover an alien craft that had been buried in the ice for over 100,000 years, as well as a frozen crewmember from the craft, they quickly celebrate the scientific discovery of a lifetime. Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), is recruited by a famed scientist to travel to the desolate continent to research the find. Told only that they are about to research an amazing discovery, Kate and a team of specialists arrive and are absolutely stunned by the magnitude of their discovery. Kate urges caution but is overridden by the expedition leader Dr. Halvorsan (Ulrich Thomsen), who insists on taking a tissue sample of the frozen creature encassed in a block of ice. Later that evening while celebrating, the very much alive creature escapes from its icy prison and begins to systematically hunt the members of the research team. The creature is eventually trapped and burned which causes some consternation over the loss of the creature for further scientific study, but many in the camp applaud its loss after seeing firsthand the destruction it is capable of. After a bizarre series of events, Kate makes the startling discovery that the cells of the creature are able to imitate and perfectly replicate any thing that it comes in contact with. As a result, not only is the creature very much alive, but the individuals in the camp may no longer be human. Trapped in a remote location with an advancing winter storm, suspicions and paranoia go through the roof as the survivors are pitted against one another, unsure of who is still human. What follows is a high-octane adventure awash in action and grizzly special-effects as the two species are locked in the ultimate battle for survival. The film has a good supporting cast and Joel Edgerton does solid supporting work as an American helicopter pilot assigned to the camp. Eric Christian Olsen provides a steadying presence as a research assistant but his character is not as developed as it could be. It is known that he and Kate know each other but their past history is undefined which makes their relationship a bit puzzling in the film especially when the survivors begin to pick sides. While the movie is not going to make fans forget the original, it is a very worthy companion piece. As the film was winding down I found myself checking off a couple of inconsistencies with the original film, but was very pleasantly surprised when this was all explained during the end credits which perfectly synced the end of this film with the opening of John Carpenterâ",

The Thing isLet me just start off this review by laying something down: It is impossible to talk about this film without mentioning John Carpenter's version. This movie is a prequel and it must be compared to what was on the table in 1982. The Thing is something I was excited to see a prequel to. I saw John Carpenter's version of The Thing for the first time last August and instantly fell in love with it. Since then, I have seen the original and this prequel four times each. I have also written a short story based off of John Carpenter's version. Least to say, I'm a huge fan of the concept of \"The Thing.\" I went into the theater expecting nothing besides amazingly horrific monsters and that is almost what I got. It was good to see The Thing have a modern prequel, but I think that the director should have stuck with what John Carpenter had done in his time. I wanted this prequel to revolutionize modern horror like John Carpenter's did back in 1982. I didn't want to see the predictable jump scares when everything gets real quiet, I didn't want to have a large cast of characters so that they could all die off. I wanted a small cast so as to understand who the characters are and to feel their fear. I wanted slow horror where the sight and sound of the Thing is so terrifying that I almost close my eyes. However, to my disappointment, I received none of these. And I don't like having to say \"The Thing 2011\" whenever I talk about this film. I wanted the director to come up with a new name or at least a name that included \"The Thing\" in it. When I wrote my short story based off of Carpenter's version, I came up with a satisfactory name in under five minutes: \"The Thing Under the Ice.\"  The director, whose name I cannot pronounce, blamed the title on \"not being able to come up with one that fit.\" That's just ridiculous. But, I digress. Another thing I didn't like about the movie was that the Thing itself relied on stupidity. In the original, it was intelligent and knew when the best time was to transform into a horrific clawed monster. In this it did so whenever it got the chance so there could be a quick, dis-satisfactory chase scene. In fact, I didn't like the design of most of the monsters. In Carpenter's version, many of the monsters were wild looking an alien, such as the one that came out of Norris' chest in the defibrillator scene. It looked like a mini version of him and it had many spider like legs and such. No Thing in The Thing 2011 looks remotely similar to the terrifying creatures that Carpenter had. Instead it focused on the meat, claws, and teeth. The one legitimately scary Thing in this prequel is the Split Face monster. The reason this one was so scary? Its design is actually from the John Carpenter film! Its corpse is seen in the original! This speaks for itself and shows that the original had much scarier designs for its monsters, like the dog thing that still unsettles me to this day. Anyhow, there were things I enjoyed about the movie. The transformations were detailed and unnerving, and I think the use of CGI in such scenes was a good decision. No animatronics could do the kind of realistic tearing and moving around of flesh that CGI can do. I also liked how they used a combination of animatronics and CGI in certain scenes. The severed hand things are actually puppets, the Split Face thing is a combination of animatronics (the body and head) and CGI. By the way, the Split Face Thing is the creature with two faces if you didn't understand what I meant when I called it that. The scene with the Thing in the helicopter is also mostly animatronics. The special effects crew just went over everything with a fine (yet slightly unrealistic) layer of CGI. To all who complain about the CGI: We're living in a modern era and the way things are done change. Don't get me wrong, I think the puppets and animatronics in the Carpenter version are amazing and better than CGI, but even compared to today, those robots are very advanced and very expensive. Anyhow, I also liked the main female role. I think that it was a nice spin compared to the all male cast in the original. I think the actors all did their jobs very well. I especially like Joel Edgerton's acting in the scene in which he is hiding in a kitchen with a knife. He seems legitimately frightened half to death and acts it out with such finesse that I felt his fear. Overall the movie was entertaining and it's fun to watch with friends when you don't really care for too much intense involvement with the film. It lacks the extreme paranoia of the original and this film is only frightening in certain scenes. Like I said, it's fun to watch, but don't expect much.",

The prequel to the cult classic feels like almost to much of a homage to the original and that its only real purpose is to be a prequel, and show some things to the audience who have seen the original that will make the go 'Oh, thats why thats there.' Dont get me wrong, these are one of the best parts of the movie, seeing how objects got there and knowing where things may go next. But you constantly fet a feeling of knowing whats going to happen next, simplycause its a rehash of the original. Yes, the action pieces are entertaining and if you haven't seen the original will be very entertained and suprised at how the dreams play out. But unlike the original there is no character build, the main character will give you slight sympathy, but the rest, you do not really care what happens to them. The last 1/4 set in the spaceship feels different to the original, but it'd could've been so much more. Overall, as said this film could have been a great prequel to a great film and done so much more, but it feels wasted, as if they just decided the original 'The Thing' worked so they're gonna do it again. It's just average, but it could literally have been great.",

While the outcome was always predetermined, the filmmakers behind this new chapter missed the opportunity to put their own unique spin on how these events played into that ending. Even the end credit sequence  which directly connects this film to the opening scene of Carpenter’s  feels like a heavy-handed contrivance meant to remind us (in case we forgot) that this was a prequel, and not a remake. But again, like The Thing itself, it’s hard to make that distinction just by looking. Luckily for the filmmakers, the imitation of a good movie still results in a fairly suitable (if flawed) copy.",

Thankfully they didn't go the remake route here and instead opted for a prequel that depicted the events that happened in the Norwegian camp prior to the '82 version. In that regard, this movie does an impressive job at tying some knots like showing how the two-faced thing came to be, as well as the origin of the dog from the start of Carpenter's Thing. Sadly, that's where most of the praise ends.\r The Thing suffers from what plagues many horror movies these days - underwritten characters and overwhelming CGI. One of the scariest things of Carpenter's version is the practical effects of the \"thing\". They were horrifying. Here, all subtlety is thrown out the window in favor of huge CGI monsters. It's effectively used in a couple scenes, but the monsters lose their scariness after a while and it just becomes gratuitous. The characters themselves are paper thin. What helped make the '82 version so fantastic is that we got to know the characters, their quirks, their personalities, and we were able to empathize with their situations. In this movie, half of the characters are interchangeable. I didn't even know most of their names. And worse yet, I didn't care about any of them. There's one particular scene that calls back to Carpenter's infamous blood test scene where I realized that most of these people are all dumb and I don't care if any of them die. That's not good in a horror movie. By that point it was just a waiting game for them to get picked off one by one.\r The lead performances are strong. For the material they were given, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Joel Edgerton do a fine job. But that simply isn't enough to carry a movie like this. The Thing is supposed to be scary, and for the most part, it isn't. That's a failure by horror standards. There's some face-value entertainment to be had here, but if you're looking for a substantial prequel to Carpenter's masterpiece, you'll be sorely disappointed.",

In this film on 3 or 4 occasions the thing actually attacks in plain sight of other people which goes against the original (JC remake).

First off, I am glad they decided to go with actual Scandinavian actors for a lot of the roles. And I like that they actually speak the language in many scenes - it helps the movie distinguish itself from Carpenters 1982 adaption.The first half of the film grabbed me and kept me interested. This is mainly where the character development takes place and they are doing a great job of setting the scene of the movie. And I love the first scene with The Thing, where it has escaped the block of ice and hides outside, waiting. I also liked their teeth filling test. It somehow seemed more believable to me than the 1982 blood boil test, which I've always found a bit odd. I mean, why would the blood react so explosively, when it doesn't when they fire a flamethrower at it? No matter, the point of the tests make sense either way.The movie does start to drag a lot when the action starts taking place. It's basically one big game of hide and seek, with no real interesting stuff going on than just quickly trying to figure out where the creature went, and who it copies next. Then fire that flamethrower and repeat the loop. It also become very confusing and it looses control over who is likely to have been infected and who isn't. It almost seems like it just always picks the least likely and suddenly that person IS the one infected. And those that it should / is most likely to be, it isn't.The characters also make some immensely stupid decisions from time to time which made me cringe a bit. For instance, Kate at some point says something about not leaving in the vehicles, because you could be trapped in the vehicle with it. Then she proceeds outside with Lars, just the two of them, to disable the vehicles. So she immediately puts herself in the situation she just warned the others about...All in all, I actually quite liked the movie, but mostly because of the first half or two thirds or so. When it all just became a looped hide n' seek, I kind of just wanted to fast-forward to the end. And the end (after the space ship part) is pretty cool, but also very expected.",
