    "summary": "Based on Michael Lewis' nonfiction bestseller \"Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game,\" the book's subject is Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane, who assembled a contending baseball club on a shoestring budget by employing a sophisticated computer-based analysis to draft players. (Sony Pictures)",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Like a cold beer under a bluebird sky; like a flawless line drive on a warm summer's day; like a long, languorous seventh-inning stretch - Moneyball satisfies.",
        "Never before, though, have statistics added up to such electrifying entertainment. After the mostly minor-league productions of recent months, this movie, which was directed by Bennett Miller, renews your belief in the power of movies.",
        "It's hard to imagine anyone but Mr. Pitt in the role. He's relaxed yet edgy and sometimes unsettling.",
        "Funny, furious, and full of front-office drama.",
        "The real protagonist of Moneyball, however, is Beane himself, played with great charisma by Brad Pitt. (With this movie and \"The Tree of Life\" competing against each other, Pitt could wind up cheating himself out of an Oscar this year.)",
        "Moneyball is the perfect sports movie for these cash-strapped times of efficiency maximization.",
        "The movie is an absolute triumph of culturally relevant filmmaking \u2013 a film that will thrill and fascinate sport junkies and non-fans alike. If you like baseball, you will love this movie. If you hate baseball, you will still love this movie.",
        "A smart, intense and moving film that isn't so much about sports as about the war between intuition and statistics. I walked in knowing what the movie was about, but unprepared for its intelligence and depth.",
        "While a hopelessly awkward-looking Hill provides fish-out-of-water laughs, Pitt gives a genuinely soul-searching performance.",
        "The supersmart and rousing Moneyball, which may be the best baseball movie since \"Bull Durham,\" is also about talk, but in a coolly heady and original inside-the-front-office way.",
        "Starring Brad Pitt in top movie star form, it's a film that's impressive and surprising.",
        "His performance is a canny portrait of leadership - part genius, part crazy guts, part dumb luck - and worthy of moving Pitt up to the playoff round of Oscar finalists for Best Actor. We'd put money on it.",
        "Now that Pitt no longer has brash youth on his side, he's digging deeper and doing more with less. It's the kind of acting - understated but woven with golden threads of movie-star style - that gives us more to look at rather than less.",
        "It really happened, it's really corny, and it's really great.",
        "The surprisingly effective Moneyball has a smart script, solid direction and great performances.",
        "A crowd-pleasing baseball movie for people - like me - who don't like baseball movies...Probably the finest baseball movie since \"Bull Durham\".",
        "The supporting cast is strong, as is the deft, sharply witty script. Miller directs elegantly, letting the narrative unfold at a deliberate, artful pace.",
        "Moneyball is a hilarious and provocative change-up, entertaining without feeling the need to swing for the fences.",
        "Although you don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy it, Moneyball is one of the best baseball movies imaginable.",
        "It's tense, strangely funny in a lot of spots and \u2013 if you grew up loving old-fashioned, seat-of-the-pants baseball, as I did \u2013 the most depressing movie of the year.",
        "Moneyball is one of the best and most viscerally exciting films of the year.",
        "This is a subtle, elegant and altogether triumphant film about a subject I thought I was tired of, told with an artistry and freshness that is positively thrilling.",
        "Moneyball is a thinking person's baseball movie, and a baseball fan's thinking movie.",
        "It's a sports story, yes, because without baseball there's no Beane.  But it's far more a tale of a man's triumph over himself and his doubters.  And you don't need math to make sense of that.",
        "Miller directs with intelligence, though not flair, but the script makes up for any flagging energy with crackling Sorkin dialogue and performances that sing with revolutionary fervor.",
        "Director Bennett Miller has produced a warm and generally agreeable character study about the pratfalls of athletic institutions and the willingness to think outside the box.",
        "You don't need to understand anything of baseball to get behind this, a chest-swelling story about second chances and flipping a finger up (even a giant foam one) to The Man.",
        "Statistics and their alleged true meaning are at the heart of Moneyball, but it's also one of the most soulful of baseball movies - it confronts the anguish of a tough game.",
        "It's to the director's credit, and Pitt's, that Moneyball is anything but bloodless - in its own quiet, unspectacular way, this movie courses with life.",
        "A richly detailed and enjoyable American yarn.",
        "This extraordinary hybrid of a movie lives and breathes the game, yet its achievement is bigger than that. There's a touch of old-fashioned romanticism here, but more crucially there's strategy going on inside Bennett Miller's movie that turns it into something cool and special.",
        "On some level Moneyball is about loyalty: loyalty to an idea, loyalty to a partnership forged by desperation, loyalty to the values you believe in. Whether that was Lewis' intention in the book, or Beane's intention in taking the risk, doesn't matter. It's the formula Miller came up with for the film, and with the team of Pitt and Hill, it's a winning one.",
        "Best of all, filmmaker Bennett Miller (Capote) uses this brainiac sports movie to remind viewers that money is neither the measure of a man nor the ultimate assessment of quality; it's a myopic metric based on past accomplishments rather than future potential. After all, success isn't always about the home runs so much as just getting on base - again, and again, and again.",
        "Moneyball is a smart, funny, and thoughtful baseball movie.",
        "Moneyball presents a misleading story line in order to prop up Billy Beane as some kind of would-be miracle worker antihero. In truth, he's just another tobacco-chewing go-getter trying to make sense of a game that, thankfully, has never quite made sense.",
        "Turning the stately game into something few can resist \u2013 a smart and lively comedy of manners.",
        "Pitt and Hill are fantastic individually, and hilarious when together -- and on a surprisingly engaging script by Aaron Sorkin (\"Social Network\") and Steve Zaillian (\"Schindler's List\").",
        "Moneyball comes to life when elaborating on Beane's unique system of player selection, and the on-field baseball action is at times electrifying, but it trends toward the generic when tailing him away from the stadium.",
        "The movie doesn't quite come together, but it's full of smart, cynical talk, and it's very entertaining.",
        "The movie does achieve something nearly impossible: Someone who doesn't even like the sport may care about Billy Beane and the 2002 Oakland Athletics.",
        "Naysayers have been claiming for years that the \"Moneyball\" book wouldn't work as a movie. But ultimately, it's the cinematic touches that keep this film version from becoming something exceptional.",
        "True to Hollywood's tireless efforts to fit square-peg material into roundish genre niches, this wavering, intermittently smart story of daring to think differently flattens its narrative into formula."

Right in the heart. A key line in the film is, \"It's hard not to be romantic about baseball.\" Being a die-hard baseball fan, it's hard not only to not get romantic about baseball, but it's also hard not to be romantic about stories like this. While based on a true story, written by Michael Lewis to explain the sabermatic approach that Billy began taking with his previous GM (when he was an assistant), and continued on with Paul, the movie never mentioned the previous GM and began the story of using the sabermatic method after meeting the fictional Peter Brand, played by Jonah Hill. The acting is the best I've seen Brad Pitt do. He was a great fit for this role and I can see why he produced it. He must have thought the same thing. I've heard Oscar buzz about it, but I don't see it carrying that far. He certainly deserves it more than for the Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Jonah Hill plays seemingly the same character he does in every movie, and does it well. And Philip Seymour Hoffman is perfect as a generic portrayal of uncooperative manager, Art Howe, a portrayal in the film and book that the real Art Howe has heavily criticized and blames Beane's disregard for him. Aaron Sorkin brings his skills as a co-writer of the screenplay to dramatize the story very well and make it palatable for non-sports fans, but for those die-hards like me, Moneyball hits all the right places.",

This film shows how two men face their ideals and their fear of change, so as to pull out the baseball team of the loser chart. They resort to math and statistics.This team represents the whole life of manager, the players are his family and when he notice that, he decides to forget about the politic of not get involved, because is easier to let them go; and start doing the opposite. Is predictable what comes of that, the team improved.The performance of Brad Pitt is one the best I have seen in years and Johan Hill surprised me, the only problem of the movie is that it is a little bit slow, but when the plot is as original as this one, the speed of the film is not important.",

What a performance, Jonah Hill and Brad Pitt, you literally couldn\u2019t take your eyes off of them, and not because they take up most of the screen time. Brad Pitt delivers his usual sensational performance, and completely deserves his Oscar nomination for this role. Jonah Hill lived up to my expectation, which pleasantly surprised me as I honestly thought he would just suddenly become the kid from Superbad, (don\u2019t get me wrong I loved Superbad but just it obviously wouldn\u2019t suit this film) Hill really pulled out all the stops for this role and I would of given him the Oscar.\r The simple story of Billy Beane and the trust he puts into Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) and their story of seeking out this baseball \u2018outcasts\u2019, and putting together an extraordinary team, is surprising rich and easy to grasp. Supported with a strong screenplay really adds to the intensity of the film.\r I really enjoyed the use of archive footage in the film which when put together with the shots of the actors worked really well, and gave the story that extra ump-ff to remind you that this is a true story and this actually happened. Also the attention to detail in this film was superb, the costumes were made to preciously resemble all of the uniforms of the baseball teams which the Oakland A\u2019s took on during the  2002 baseball season.\r I thoroughly enjoyed the experience I felt by watching this film.\r In hindsight I will admit this is not a film which will grab you unless your in the mood for it, it\u2019s not a film that will grab you by the throat and scream at you to enjoy it, it\u2019s not Die Hard. It\u2019s a beautifully crafted masterpiece which creates an emotional connection with you (if you\u2019re in the right mood) and really sticks with you your feelings towards the characters after the film has finished.  This is definitely a film I would watch again and would recommend to anybody.",

It was okay but curiously, for effect no doubt, devoid of any passion or emotion except when Brad threw things around the clubhouse or at home. Everyone spoke very mannerly and low key, very consciously, except for the coach Billy Beane fired who showed a little genuine passion. Perhaps the fact that all was connected to objective, detached statistics on baseball players they decided to play the movie that way, devoid of passion. Personally, I had more passion in teaching one class than was evident in that whole movie. However, having said that, it was an okay rendering of the information on using stats like on-base percentage to determine a players inherent worth to a team. Still, it is very over-rated!",

Some pop in the bat doesn't hurt either. The Bears, a motley group of little-league castoffs whom no other team in their division would ever pick, only start to win after their beer-guzzling manager Morris Buttermaker recruits Amanda Wurlitzer, a gender-breaking pitcher with a dominant curve(she's pre-Chelsea Baker, the knuckleball phenom) that the ex-professional ballplayer had decided two years ago was all washed-up as a daughter. On-base percentage doesn't win you games, it's the sound of the ball hitting the catcher's mitt, and the umpire calling the batter out on strikes, swinging or otherwise. In contrast to their former starter Rudi Stein, Amanda is Peppermint Patty to his Charlie Brown; she's unhittable; she keeps her clothes on, but the Bears still lose 1-0, because Lupus, f*****' Lupus, that \"booger-eating moron,\" can't hit the cut-off man from left-field, and lets the game-winning run score. It's not all his fault, though. The Bears can't hit. Never mind the homerun, three games into the season, and the team is still searching for their first baserunner. Coach Buttermaker sees his team's offensive deficiencies, and practically invents Moneyball. So embarrassed was Ahmad by his opening game errors to the Yankees that he hid out in a tree(after a half-inning forfeit), still can't get on base, but the coach knows that the black kid is fast, so the drunkard promises to teach him how to bunt. Ahmad's hero should be Malcolm X, not Hank Aaron, because sabermetrics preaches the theory of \"by any means necessary\". In \"Moneyball\", you half-expect to hear a reprise of Bizet's \"Carmen\", when Oakland A's free-agent pickup Scott Hatteberg, previously the catcher for the Boston Red Sox(damaged goods due to a bum shoulder), makes error upon error, as if the converted first baseman was in communion with Toby Whitewood. To manager Art Howe, he's bad news. But GM Billy Beane, acting on advice from his assistant Peter Brand, a sabermetrics guru, thinks Hatteberg can still play the game. Despite not having Ahmad's wheels, Beane's pet project has the ability to get on base. Hatteberg walks. It's a talent which makes him proportionately more valuable than Mariners' leadoff hitter Ichiro Suzuki, because despite his annual 200 hits, the ten-time all-star swings at a lot of first pitches, resulting in a relatively low on-base percentage, the stat that trumps batting average as the real barometer of worth to the new school, founded by Brand's hero Bill James. Hatteberg, therefore, is worth the trouble, so like Buttermaker teaching Tanner the fundamentals of shortstop, it's Ron Washington's job to make people forget about Giambi by turning the ruined catcher into a functional first baseman. (Washington had his own demon: cocaine.) History shows that Beane's gambit paid off(Hatteberg batted .280, and had a fielding percentage of .994), but it's somewhat misleading and downright downright dishonest, narrative-wise, that \"Moneyball\" should cast this role player as the lynchpin to this financially-strapped team's miracle on the field(the A's sported a payroll three times less than the Yankees: $41M to $126M). Contrary to the sabermetrics propaganda of the film, the 2002 Oakland A's did not win a MLB-high 103 games because Beane traded Carlos Pena to Detroit, which, in effect, forced Howe's hand into playing Hatteberg. It was the pitching, stupid. Oakland had three Amandas: Tim Hudson, Barry Zito, and Mark Mulder. Heck, even the last man in the rotation, Cory Lidle, was more relevant than the pitchers \"Moneyball\" makes mention of: Chad Bradford, a submarine middle reliever, and late-season addition Ricardo Rincon, whose acquisition from the Indians inspires such elation in Brand, you would think that Hudson just threw another shutout. Unlike \"The Bad News Bears\", where the Bears face the Yankees, the A's never did get the chance to square off with the fat cats, losing somewhat ignominiously in the ALDS to the Twins(payroll $40M), who are, perhaps, every bit the underdog that Beane's team was, in five games. The real climax to \"Moneyball\", judging by the postscript, occurs in \"Fever Pitch\", when Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore run onto the field in Yankee Stadium after the Sox clinch the pennant(en route to their World Series win over the Cards), since the film gives Beane's methods all the credit. Does Moneyball work? Well, in the 1976 Michael Ritchie film, while the walks and hit batters keep the Bears alive in that final game with the Yanks, it's Kelly Leak's moonshot that nearly wins it all for the overachievers. Some pop in the bat doesn't hurt. Exhibit A: Miguel Tejada, with his 34 HRs and 131 RBIs. Lucky for the A's, he just swung away, walking only 38 times in 162 games. Then again, Leak doesn't accept the free pass and ends up getting thrown out at home plate.",

But he went onto have a very nice career as a GM for the Oakland A's having to play with the big boys {big market clubs} working with about 20% of their capital.  He had a chance to become GM of the Red Sox and turned it down to stay with the A's.  All it proves is that he likes to beat his head against the wall because longterm he can never win.  I would have liked to see more character development because he is in a no win situation.  No questioning his passion for the job but the truth is baseball without a hardcap is a flawed product in which 99% of the times only the big markets can win!  Nice acting but otherwise the movie is going nowhere.  It is never explained why he is such a troubled soul?  I would have loved to see his life unfold.  What is the definition of insanity?  To do the same thing over and over and to expect a different result.  Billy can find talent but has no chance of ever keeping it the way the current state of affairs is managed under Bud Selig.  I live in NYC but feel the small markets have been shut out of competing.  How can you continually root for IBM but that is what Yankee fans do every year as they must buy every new toy on the free agent market.  Very sad commentary on true sportsman who love the game on a level playing field.  If Billy had the same tools to work with he is one of the best in the business.  No one doubts that!  Just another movie going nowhere.",

What emerges, is a film about life, laden with its struggles, challenges, losses, and triumphants, with baseball, inconsequentially as its backdrop. For the ardent sports enthusiast, much of the \"art\" of the game is captured, however, it is presented in a manner that is near the fringes of condescension and whose suspension of disbelief and disregard can become offensive to witness. Moreover, the story (albeit \"true\") is deliberately told in fallacy in order to dramatize the truth (can't forget it's Hollywood). This is specifically true in the ball club's roster, of which wasn't as aggregated with misfits as the film suggests. Nevertheless, \"Moneyball\" is a tale that is told with passion, diligence, and finesse, (Zaillian and Sorkin) thanks largely in part to Pitt's amiable character and delivery. While the errors in the film will be hardly noticeable to most, it is certain that the film will leave many thoroughly entertained and ready to dust off the old mitt and get the shoulders warm for throwing. It's bound to earn one's admiration far past the seventh-inning stretch; no stops to concessions for this one.",

The problem I have with the movie is I have the disadvantage of actually knowing something about the 2002 Oakland A's.  The film is dishonest because it willfully overstates the impact of a few baseball scrubs and completely ignores the great players the A's already had.  Not only that it willfully misrepresents the fact that Jeremy Giambi (Jason Giambi's brother) played in 124 games for the A's the year before in 2001!  He wasn't a new discovery.  How could the filmmaker not even mention that the A's had one of the best pitching staffs in baseball in 2001 and they were back for 2002:  Barry Zito won 23 games in 2001 and won the Cy Young Award as the league's best pitcher, Mark Mulder won 19 games, Tim Hudson won 15 games.  They are literally never mentioned in the film!  Miguel Tejada is barely mentioned and he was the League MVP batting over .300 with 34 home runs and 131 runs batted in.  Eric Chavez is never mentioned and he hit 34 homers and drove in 109 runs.  David Justice, meanwhile, was kind of a wash out and Scott Hatteberg was important to the team--but, certainly there was already a key group of players in place.  Also, the concept of on base percentage was not new...and the previous A's general manager Sandy Alderson was instrumental in using statistical analysis before Billy Beane arrived.  And, Johnny Damon had had a terrible 2001 season, so letting him go was not without reason anyway.   Also, the Minnesota Twins, who beat the A's in the playoffs, had virtually an identical small payroll and continued to be a more competitive team than the A's over the next decade.  So, my main problem with the film is not to say that the \"moneyball\" approach didn't do anything for the A's--it did.  But, it didn't do everything and they were not alone in using statistical analysis to discover value.  But, that's Hollywood--overstating and making things black and white is their specialty.   Brad Pitt is really getting to be a much better actor as he ages though--he's excellent in the movie.",

Professional baseball is different than any other sport, in the sense that some big market teams truly outspend the small market teams.  The movie does a nice job in making this point.  However, it grossly oversimplifies what Moneyball really is, it is not only looking at OBP (on base percentage), as the movie implies.  It is also a movie; it is not historically accurate in a number of ways.  But neither of those flaws detract from the movie being enjoyable.  Brad Pitt is fine playing a good looking ex-jock and Jonah Hill does a nice job playing a made up character (as the person who really was Beane's assistant refused to let his name be used, which led to Paul DePodesta's \"role\" being played as an overweight nerd).  Phillip Seymour-Hoffman is perfect as manager Art Howe, who the movie vilifies (as it also does to scouts).  Perhaps that dichotomy is the biggest weakness of an entertaining film:  creating tension by making the good guys really good and their enemies seemingly (and at the same time) stupid, vicious and mean.  But that's movies for you.  Still an enjoyable film that is worth seeing.",

I'm glad that they showed situations between the general manager and the players about drafting and trading. There were also emotional parts, which was perfect. I just want to specified that the movie did one mistake. In one scene, Casey Beane (played by Kerris Dorsey) sang a song to her dad (Billy Beane, played by Brad Pitt). The song was called '' The show '', by Lenka. It was released in 2008, but in the movie, the story takes place in 2002. So it's impossible for the girl to sing it.

Moneyball is no exception.  While it didn't have that extreme wow factor, it was still very inspiring, especially being a true story.  I am a fan of history and learning about things; it was nice to learn more about the Oakland A's.What a spectacular message this movie delivers.  There are a lot of nay sayers in life.  It is important to be flexible, but generally we as people are creatures of habit.  We say we embrace change but we don't really mean it.  You really have to put your mind to it to genuinely be open to change.  We see that true and true in the characters that Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill play.  And, as we learn in movies like Blindside and Pursuit of Happyness, don't ever give up, don't ever let anyone tell you that you can't.I love the plot.  The dichotomy between flashbacks and present time.  And family struggles, like Brad's character being divorced but still wearing his wedding ring.  And having to talk to his wife's husband.  And trying to raise his 12 year old daughter.The only thing that I can think of that this movie needed to improve on is the airport scene, which, mind you, is very very very minor.  Just that this occurred in late 2001 and 2002 and beyond, which is post 9/11.  Meaning that you wouldn't be able to greet or say goodbye to your loved ones right at the plane gate.  What with the advent of the TSA.I am delighted that this movie introduced me to Mrs. Lenka Kripac.  And her lovely song The Show, which I can definitely relate to at this time in my life.  I think it is very cool that she is half Australian and Czech.  And she shares the same birthday as a friend of mine.I do not like Brad, but I respect his success and I enjoyed him in this movie.  I love Jonah - he is a big reason why I saw this movie in the first place.

Through a combination of great acting, a clever script and sheer energy, Moneyball is certainly up there with the top sports movies. It questions the very foundations of, and morality behind big-money US sports, and how shallow and mercenary they have become over the years. Brad Pitt is simply spellbinding as the ambitious but troubled and volatile baseball team manager Billy Beane, and Jonah Hill leaves his Superbad days long behind him with a mature and effortlessly natural performance as Peter Brand, an economics graduate who impresses Beane with his knowledge of baseball statistics and is hired to be the brains behind the Oakland Athletics. As the most memorable sport films tend to be, Moneyball is a good old-fashioned underdog story based on a series of truly remarkable real events. The only thing I question about the film is the need to fall back on tried and tested sports movie cliches for the finale - slow-motion, muffled sound, you name it it's in there, and it somewhat undermines the whole show. Some aspects of the film's plot can also be difficult to follow if you're unfamiliar with baseball, but it would be unfair to mark a film down harshly for a lack of viewer knowledge. These are very minor gripes in the grand scheme of things, and Moneyball is still a compelling viewing experience, and for the most part, a refreshingly different take on a sports movie.",

This movie overall was just plain great. Its amazing how good of a movie they made out of such a flat subject. Moneyball is a movie for the ages, definitely my pick for best movie of 2011. Brad Pitt was hilarious, and he did a award deserving performance in showing us who Billy Beane truly is, a great guy whose struggled through some big hardships, just trying to win some baseball games the right way. Whether you have a major love for the game of baseball or if you absolutely hate it, you will love this movie. Its not focusing on the game of baseball specifically, its focusing mostly on Billy Beanes story which is inspiring, and also about the tough world of business. Brad Pitt will definitely be nominated for an academy award, either for this or the tree of life, and Moneyball is more than deserving of a best picture nomination and potentially a win. Go see this movie now, youll love it, and youll learn to love and earn much respect for Billy Beane. A film for the ages, 10/10 definitely.",

The contentious issues of how to divide the revenue in an equitable manner led to the cancellation of the playoffs and World Series in 1994 and is still largely unresolved today. While smaller market teams are given funds from a luxury tax imposed on larger payroll teams, it still fails to provide an even competitive playing field when large market teams, such as the New York Yankees, can field teams with a $225 million-plus payroll while the smaller market teams have to make do with budgets often under $40 million. Naturally, this has put many teams at a competitive disadvantage and most feel that they have no chance to win long-term, even as they develop cheap homegrown talent in their minor-league systems. They lose said talent to the larger market clubs once players become eligible for free agency. It is against this backdrop that the new film \u00e2",

Brad Pitt (I'm not one of his fans) gives a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. His portrayal of Billy Beane, the now famous General Manager of the Oakland A's gives life to a character than I found to be rather flat in the book of the same title. The supporting actors (except for Jonah Hill) are excellent and surprisingly the best of the bunch is Phillip Seymour Hoffman playing manager Art Howe.The divorced father-daughter relationship is played just right and I thought the \"flashbacks\" to Beane's youth and professional playing days were well done. More importantly, live action scenes were blended seamlessly with archive footage of actual events during the 2001 and 2002 baseball seasons. I'd rank this film in my top ten sports movies and in a flat footed tie with \"The Natural\" as my all time favorite baseball movie.",

Moneyball manages to surpass that and turns itself into the rarest kind of drama: a true story that manages to drum up more tension, suspense, emotion, and power than one can get from pure fiction.  The pacing is perfect, the plot incredible dramatic for a true story, and though it's a story of statistics and sabermetrics, Moneyball is incredibly passionate about the game at its core.  Brat Pitt is excellent as Billy Beane, giving at times a beautifully reserved and nuanced performance while at others blasting out raw emotion by throwing chairs, desks, and Gatorade coolers across a room.  And Jonah Hill, a name mostly unheard outside of comedies, showed his dramatic abilities while still managing to expertly pull out laughs whenever he could.  And the final ten minutes of the film, after the climax had passed, the action had ended, and the Athletics had lost, are probably some of the most underscored yet emotionally forceful moments of the film.  I don't go to the theater much anymore; the prices are just too high.  I only really go when I'm sure what I'm about to see is worth the money.  And Moneyball did not disappoint.",

The story is well-adapted and benefits from the constraints of a real-life situation, hence the lack of hollywood ending (which I appreciated.)  However, I think that Brad Pitt wasn't the best choice for the lead role.  He isn't bad per se, but is a bit too much like the Brad we see in other movies.  I left the theatre thinking that the pace and content of this show made it more like a TV movie, if that makes sense to anyone.  It just lacked that 'wow' factor on some level.
