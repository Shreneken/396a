  "critic_reviews": [
    "Drive works as a great demonstration of how, when there's true talent behind the camera, entertainment and art are not enemies but allies.",
    "Low-key, sleek and sophisticated, Drive provides the visceral pleasures of pulp without sacrificing art. It's cool and smart. Some critics might even call it European.",
    "Few actors working today could make emotional sense of such a protean character, but Ryan Gosling does so with calm authority. He's a formidable presence in a film that grabs your gaze and won't let go except for moments when you can't help but look away.",
    "A brilliant piece of nasty business that races on a B-movie track until it switches to the dizzying fuel of undiluted creativity. Damn, it's good. You can get buzzed just from the fumes coming off this wild thing.",
    "The film is little more than an exercise in style, but it's dazzling and mythic, a testament to the fundamental appeal of fast cars, dangerous men, and tension that squeezes like a hand to the throat.",
    "Drive feels like some kind of masterpiece - it's as pure a version of the essentials as you're likely to see.",
    "Drive not only met my hopes; it charged way over the speed limit, partly because it's an unapologetically commercial picture that defies all the current trends in mainstream action filmmaking.",
    "Ultra-violent and ultra-stylish, Drive stands out in this year's Cannes competition for its calculated, hard-edged brilliance.",
    "I can't remember the last time I felt so seduced by a film.",
    "The look is artfully stylized, influenced by classic film noir; the mood is dark; the performances nuanced; and the story unnervingly exciting.",
    "The movie has you from its nearly wordless opening sequence.",
    "The entire film, in fact, seems much more real than the usual action-crime-chase concoctions we've grown tired of. Here is a movie with respect for writing, acting and craft. It has respect for knowledgable moviegoers.",
    "What ultimately makes Drive so compelling is its characters - sketches given dimension and heft by a superb cast.",
    "From the beginning, it's clear this is not a standard-order action film. It takes its characters as seriously as its chases, shootouts, and fights.",
    "Tense car chases, action scenes handled with crisp panache and Canadian actor Ryan Gosling channelling Steve McQueen as an existential wheel man add up to make Drive one of the best arty-action films since Steven Soderbergh's \"The Limey.\"",
    "Combing a memorably gritty Ryan Gosling performance with the breakneck tempo of the getaway cars his character handles for hire, Refn churns out a hyperactive love letter to road rage with unapologetic glee. It's a total blast.",
    "As the film accrues intensity and awakes the demon lurking inside its protagonist, you can see it as something more than a retro-cool crime story.  Rather, it's a parable of good and evil and the nature of man.",
    "Among Gosling's many star-making qualities is his nuanced mastery, since \"The Believer,\" of a facial expression of infinitely adaptable, imperturbable, sustained calm that can read as chilling or ardent, hard or soft, as the role demands.",
    "Buckle up; it's quite a ride.",
    "For all the movement in Drive, the quiet, deathly still moments are the ones that count.",
    "Though both highly stylized and highly stylish, Drive isn't hurting for substance. It has rich, complex characters and a storyline that's both emotionally engaging and almost sickeningly suspenseful.",
    "So it's a fun, if not exhilarating, ride, one sped along with the help of a wonderfully assembled cast.",
    "Think of Drive as the cinematic equivalent of riding in a car that projects a fashionably stylish image. Sure, the gas mileage may be terrible and the engine unreliable, but it's such a smooth, good-looking ride that you'll put up with the annoyances.",
    "Oh alright, it ain't \"Shane.\" But it is about as much shamelessly disreputable, stylish, ultra-violent fun you're going to have at the movies this year.",
    "Drive dynamically merges a terrific film noir plot with a cool retro look, evoking '60s classics like \"Point Blank\" and \"Bullitt.\"",
    "Starring Ryan Gosling as a Hollywood stuntman/getaway driver, Drive takes the tired heist-gone-bad genre out for a spin, delivering fresh guilty-pleasure thrills in the process.",
    "With its emphasis on relationships and character, Drive can best be described as a thinking man's action film -- or at least, it could if it didn't ultimately feel so oddly slight. As it is, for all of its positives, it functions mostly as a guilty pleasure rather than as a movie that resonates the way, say, \"Blue Valentine\" does.",
    "It's fun, but the script, credited to Hossein Amini (\"The Wings of the Dove\"), is short on characterization and long on plot twists and wisecracks.",
    "Mainstream audiences will probably be confounded by Drive, while lovers of gritty filmmaking will defend every exaggerated shotgun wound as art. Know which camp you're in before you enter the theater.",
    "As Refn is riffing on thriller cliches, he gets solid support from the ensemble. Brooks, a comedic standout since the '70s, makes a sympathetic villain, and Gosling stokes the young-Brando comparisons - instead of settling for Richard Gere.",
    "Plays like an exalted episode of \"Miami Vice\" or a stealth version of \"Shane.\"",
    "Nobody puts the \"angst\" in \"gangster\" like a European director. When the director's a Dane, you can count on gloomy, chilly visuals and deliberate pacing. And when the director is Nicolas Winding Refn, who made the \"Pusher\" series in his native country and \"Bronson\" in England, you can expect intense, often brutal spurts of violence.",
    "Buckle up for a bumpy ride but one that a road warrior like McQueen would hitch in a heartbeat.",
    "They (Refn and Gosling) have collaborated on a car picture that unnerves us with its idling quiet, and then pins our ears back when they stomp the accelerator.",
    "A lot of critics will talk about how the movie is a stripped-down, \"pure\" genre\r\npiece, and there's a lot of truth to that. What may not get as much press is the\r\nway stripped-down-ness is an affectation, and always has been.",
    "Refn's mix of grindhouse horror with sweetie-pie sentiment is a recipe mastered by Takeshi Kitano (and, in his own way, David Lynch), but this director's brew is simpler, more direct, less cerebral and less heartfelt. To invest oneself emotionally in the central relationship, or the movie itself, would be akin to investing oneself emotionally in one's car. But when the car looks this good and drives this fast, why not?",
    "Basically, Drive is a song of courtly love and devotion among the automatons. It's a machine, but it works.",
    "Drive begins extremely well and ends in a muddle of ultraviolence, hypocrisy and stylistic preening, which won't be any sort of deterrent for those who like its looks.",
    "Drive is a Los Angeles neo-noir, a neon-lit crime story made with lots of visual style. It's a film in love with both traditional noir mythology and ultra-modern violence, a combination that is not ideal.",
    "Though it easily surpasses most American action flicks, it suffers from the old commercial imperative of making the protagonist a nice guy, something Refn has seldom bothered with in Europe.",
    "Having delighted in the doominess of Drive, as its journey began, I ended much less joyful than repelled.",
    "The virtuosity on display is also the director's, of course, and that, for better and for worse, is pretty much the point of Drive, the coolest movie around and therefore the latest proof that cool is never cool enough.",
    "Every bit as dumb as August's \"Conan the Barbarian\" but awash in neon-lit nightscapes and existential dread, with killings so graphic that you can't entirely believe what you're gagging at."

If you aren't instantly drawn in by the opening chaseEasily one of the best films of 2011. The opening 5 minutes of Drive are simply extraordinary: zero music and virtually no dialogue, just the Driver outrunning the cops after a burglary. If you aren't instantly drawn in by the opening chase sequence, your favorite movie is most likely Transformers and you do not deserve to see the greatness this film beholds. This raw and realistic film is falsely advertised by its trailers; they make it seem like a hardcore action flick, but it turns out to be an intensely character driven story with very minimal, but effective, dialogue that progresses the story at a continuously entertaining pace. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen in years: it seems effortlessly smooth and endlessly creative. The plot is simple, but Refn's execution is, in part, what makes the film ultimately stand out. Another crucial part to what makes this film so enticing is its ruthless depiction of violence. I KNOW that some (actually, a lot of) people are turned away, or dislike, Drive solely because of its graphic violence. These people are dumb; IT'S A MOVIE (not real). The violence is as realistic as it gets, without being over-exaggerated to the point of blood spraying 10 feet into the air in all directions when someone gets stabbed. There ARE some very graphic scenes, but I feel that it's a reflection of the characters (especially Albert Brook's and Ryan Gosling's characters). Most of the film is actually absent of action/violence, in which i was pleasantly surprised by. It's probably a 75/25 split. Overall, if you have any appreciation of good film, you definitely need to see this film. It's amazing and should win a handful of Oscars.",

Drive is a beautiful, thematically rich and powerful film. The whole castAt its most basic level, Drive could be described as \"The Transporter with a brain\". If you yourself possess even half a brain, you'll realise that it is so much more. Drive is a beautiful, thematically rich and powerful film. The whole cast are superb, with Ryan Gosling imbuing The Driver with a deep, brooding emotion, and making him a very engaging protagonist despite him being a character of very few words. It's a true testament to Gosling's skill as an actor that he can communicate to the viewer so much about what his character is thinking through a single facial expression, or physical act. The Driver is also the epitome of cool, from his scorpion-emblazoned white jacket, sunglasses and Clint Eastwood-esque toothpick, to the leather driving gloves he dons and the unassuming analogue watch he fastens to his steering wheel when on a job. Carey Mulligan is also extremely believable as single mother Irene, and has great chemistry with Gosling. It is because this central relationship, this unlikely romance works that The Driver gains much of its emotional leverage, and with the addition of a surprisingly effective soundtrack of soppy electro-pop love songs, the few moments of intimacy that The Driver and Irene share, and the ultimate tragedy of their story, is all the more affecting. Bryan Cranston is brilliant as always as the crippled garage owner and low-level mob dealer Shannon, Ron Perlman is entertaining as Jewish mob heavy Nino and Albert Brooks is simply terrifying as Bernie Rose, the psychotic razor-wielding mob boss who serves as the film's primary antagonist. The film is about fractured identity, and about redemption through good deeds. This never more clear than through the characterisation of The Driver. He remains nameless throughout the film, only referred to in relation to his profession - he is a functional tool before he is a person. It is only through his steadily growing love for Irene and her young son Benicio, and through his quest for justice in punishing the Los Angeles criminal underworld that he finds his humanity, and symbolically saves his soul, proving himself to be a real person. Building on these philosophically heavy themes, Hossein Amini's script is deceptively simple, but effective - he gives his characters enough to say to communicate their feelings and map their growth over the course of the film, but pleasingly he doesn't fall into the trap of convoluted, inherently unrealistic dialogue purely designed to show audiences how clever the film is. These are real people, speaking (or not, in The Driver's case) as real people do, and the film's heady themes speak for themselves, and Amini knows this, and smartly doesn't resort to highlighting them in his dialogue, which would have made it heavy and laborious, rather than honest and minimalistic as it is. Drive is not just an achievement for clever writing, but also a visual triumph. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel uses his experience working frequently with Bryan Singer extremely effectively here - like in X-Men or Valkyrie, he is demanded in Drive to adapt his filming style to a number of visually and tonally different sequences - whether it's an expansive aerial shot of the glittering L.A. skyline, or a frantic car chase, or a more mellow and intimate moment in Irene's apartment, Sigel always rises to the challenge and creates something visually striking. The cinematography, married with Matthew Newman's masterful editing and the effectively moody film noir lighting used throughout the film, Driver becomes a real thing of beauty. Nicholas Winding Refn continues to prove his talent as an extremely creative, intelligent director that isn't afraid to challenge his audience. He's also extremely adept at handling action, without reducing himself to mainstream drudgery - the car chases and shootouts are all entertaining, but aren't dumb and obvious, and have more in common with the work of Martin Scorsese than Michael Bay. Refn clearly knows that less is more, and is prepared to make you wait, to really rack up the tension before giving you a blood-soaked or tyre-smoke clouded payoff, and the set-pieces are far more powerful as a result. Drive is many things - a religious allegory, an intense psychodrama, a tender love story, a gangster-thriller, a film noir, and it even has much of the iconography and themes of a classic Western. It looks great, sounds great, is well-scripted, clever without being pretentious, packs a real emotional punch and is extremely well-acted, particularly by the mesmerising Gosling. Simply put, Drive is stunning.",

I recall watching this film with a buddy of mine and reaching the credits only for both of us to look over at eachother with our mouths open wide in shock.  \"What the heck was that?

He was totally outraged at how bizzarely boring the whole film had been and I was utterly blown away by the fact that it was obvious someone had found a short story at some point before the first script was written and had tried to adapt it to a screenplay without realizing it was a total DOA mess.  The characters are dull, lifeless.  Ryan Goslings performance is lukewarm at best.  The soundtrack wasn't even memorable outside of one decent credit roller song at the end.  Though the action scenes are shot well, the rest of the film outside of those scenes just falls flat in terms of emotional conveyance.  The romance between the two main characters is unbelievable and creepy.  All of their scenes together are terribly awkward as well.  The main antagonists end up just being some old italian mob guys who just happen to be involved.

The driver in this film is just as picky and OCD as Jason Statham's character in the Transporter, but that's where the similarities end. After a nice opening, this film quickly turns into some noir love story, that really focuses more on the conflicted driver, than on anything else, making this one boring film.

It's extremetlyIt's been a long time since I saw a movie that I fell in love with like this.  The movie grabbed a hold of me immediately; the opening sequence in this movie is one of the greatest beginnings to any movie I've ever seen.  It's extremetly suspenseful, and you can feel the tension through the entire 15 minute scene.  This is the way a \"driving\" movie should be, not that cornball Fast Five bulls***.  Once this scene ends, the real story gets underway.  Ryan Gosling plays the \"Driver\".  As his character puts it, (and I'm paraphrasing), \"You have me for 5 minutes.  If anything happens in that 5 minutes I'm yours.  After that, I'm gone.  I don't carry a gun, I drive.\"  He's a VERY quiet character, and I have no doubt that the biggest reason people may not like this movie is because of this.  There are some long scenes with no action and very little dialogue.  It sounds odd on paper, but it works beautifully.  The director (Nicolas Winding Refn) does a terrific job of creating an atmosphere, or a mood to convey the emotion of the characters.  The actors do a great job of backing up his vision as well, as they can covery their emotions very well despite having limited lines to work with.  Most of these scenes happen immediately following the opening sequence, and helps introduce and develop the characters.  Gosling starts to fall for the girl next door and her young son.  He learns that her husband is in prison, but when he unexpectedly is released early, Gosling is silently devastated.  This may sound like a love movie, but s*** hits the fan when Gosling finds the husband bloodied and beaten by gangsters looking to collect protection money from him while he was in prison.  The husband confides that he won't do the job they want him to do, but is considering it because the gangsters have threatened that they'll come for his wife and son next time.  Gosling decides he will step in to be the getaway driver on the job, and from there on out the movie turns into a high octane thriller.  There is an insane amount of violence in the 2nd half of the movie, so this movie isn't for the squeamish.  I won't say much more, because it may ruin the experience.  That's essentially what this movie is.... an experience like nothing I've seen before.  When's the last time you've seen a suspense/drama/thriller/love/crime/driving movie with a bad a$$ 80's synth pop soundtrack?  That's right... never.  This movie is completely original, and I'll even go as far as to call it a classic.  This movie will hold up VERY well over time.

Better yet is that I wasn't expecting it... at all. With a title like Drive, and a pretty-boy star like Ryan Gosling (whom I had greatly underestimated until this film - poor judgment on my part), one would expect this to be a Hollywood blockbuster action movie with lots of cool chase scenes. Well it's not. In fact, there are only two chase scenes in the film, and while one is rather exciting and fits the standard bill, the other is a masterpiece. This chase opens the film, and it's not at all what you're expecting. It is slow, deliberate, and suspenseful; a driver attempts to avoid the police, on the moonlit streets of LA, not with speed and skill (though he does possess them), but with cunning. This scene sets the tone for the rest of the film: a cool, calculated, character-driven story, which doesn't say as much as it does - much like its protagonist.\r Lack of a name and lack of words make the driver a very mysterious character. We get absolutely no sense of who he was, or how he arrived at his current situation - no time lost to an over-complicated backstory. In a way, we are offered more of a description of his character than most movies would provide, but only through his actions. Stanley Kubrick was a huge believer in the importance of watching a film. It is evident in 2001: A Space Odyssey (10/10 in my book) that he urges his audience to watch rather than listen. In case you haven't seen it, the very first dialogue occurs about 25 minutes into the film, and the rest is sparse to say the least. Drive director Nicolas Winding Refn does the same, telling most of his story through body language, facial expressions, and brilliant camera work.\r Let me stop here and say that the cinematography in this film is among my favorite ever. This is possibly the most masterful aspect of the story: it unfolds so beautifully on screen.\r Refn also displays some brilliant qualities of another director, and this claim may be a bit unexpected: it's Quentin Tarantino. I'll have to clarify what I mean here. The great majority of a Tarantino film like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, or Inglourious Basterds is character development. Tarantino accomplishes this with very long and seemingly inconsequential dialogues. The rest of the movie is generally violent; by this I mean sudden, shocking, sometimes appalling violence. This effectively makes a Tarantino film very gritty, when in fact a huge portion of it is friendly dialogue about Big Macs in France, for example. The character development in Drive is very different, because it is so visual. But the rest of the movie is, like Tarantino's, extremely gritty. Folks, this is some of the most disturbing violence out there, because the realism is so great, and because the camera does not shy away. I'm not trying to say it's a gore fest. It's nothing like that, in fact. It's just so real that it hurts. I happen to think it is superb, but it definitely makes me cringe. I'm warning you right now that some of it may not be pleasant - but that's the point.\r For a much more lengthy and in-depth review, see my blog at kofdrops.blogspot.com.",

I just finished watching this movie for the second time, after almost a year in between.  I purposely delayed a second viewing, thinking there was no way it could stand up to the sheer exhilaration I felt the first time I watched it, but I was wrong.\rThis movie is unlike anything else I have ever seen.  The opening sequence of Driver performing his job, has a perfect musical score, and the way that the entire sequence follows the plays of the baseball game on the radio, up to and including the first of many beautiful and unexpected moments mini-climaxes are the first indications of this movies graceful, almost shy, but still intense perfection.  Many have called Driver (the unnamed protagonist) emotionless, but they clearly lack any understanding of the subtle shyness and think first speak later mentality that comes from being a lonely hermit.  Driver is a true hero, as the beautiful musical score states.  He is an archetype sorely missing in today's era of morally relative anti-heroes.  Not that I don't love the typical anti-hero, but despite the multiple grisly murders that Driver performs throughout the second half of the film, there is never any doubting his purity and heroic nature.  In the end, this is a film of contradiction.  A gritty violent crime drama mixed with a subtle, shy, and tender love story.  Brief but explosive action mixed into moments of pure serenity.  Slow detail oriented drama building to a climax of murder, mayhem, and old school cowboy heroics.  I simply don't understand how anyone could find this masterpiece of modern cinema to be anything short of perfection.  Drive is the closest thing to perfection you are likely to find on Netflix or Blu-Ray any time soon, so just go watch it.  You won't regret it.",

There is an incredible amount of love that he has for his films, just as we do. To be honest, I didn't get the film at first. Neither do I now. I still find it upsetting. Unstable, to be precise. There's a lot that I don't get. There's a lot that I love. The most I love about the film is the space. Never has any filmmaker understood the space between the characters. And not just with other characters, but us too. The car too.And what better way to shoot an action film then respecting that space, drawing a sound and clear boundary, not pushing but marking it. And remember it is not a punch in or punch out or car chase action, it is in its pure physical action form. It could be a realization that makes you turn, change your path or open your way or move past someone without saying. These charismatic and yet intimate sequences that spirals the most heartwarming friendship between a boy and a girl, is the biggest win for me.And for a minute there, I thought it is Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan slow dancing in their livelihood. But it is Gosling and anyone for that matter. Even someone shady as Oscar Issac is given a second chance and Bryan Cranston a statutory warning. So it is Gosling both charging this electrifying Hollywood night and a warm sunny morning. The balance is in his hands. And his hands on the wheel. Drive is a much more controlled ride then it is out of control. And still it doesn't remains to be a safe, recommended one. I find myself wearing two seat belts, for the questionable structure that bounces up and down.",

This movie was not too wierd or \"arts-y\" for me. The reason for the low score is that it is genuinely awful. I would have given it a 0, but the opening scene is very good, and I liked one other scene.  Apart from that, I see absolutely nothing redeeming about Drive.  The protagonist is an antisocial personality-vacuum.  The love interest and her son are cute but ornamental.  The two mob villains are ham-fisted and cliched to a point beyond parody.  The audience is given no reason to emotionally invest in the well-being of any characters.  There is not a germ of realism in the tacky, tv-movie script.  All of which could serve to reinforce the mythology, if that's what this movie is after, but the archetypes aren't strong enough, and the story arc not epic enough to sustain a myth.  And, to top it all off, amid all the clumsy writing and un-reality of the script, the filmmakers practically beg to be taken seriously with overlong dramatic pauses and hyper-graphic depictions of violence.  It is a superficial, nihilistic, cynical exercise in vanity that seems to want to be taken as deep.  It's terrible.",

Ryan plays an emotionally detached character, Driver, who has a simple 5 minute rule.  You hire him, and he's there for you completely for 5 minutes.  Anything a minute either side of that, and you are on your own.  What a setup!  There's not a lot of dialogue from Driver, but what there is is acted out so well and glues you to your seat.  The perfectly tuned soundtrack serves as another character in the film, helping to steer the action and heighten the emotion of the film.  I can't say that I've ever seen a movie quite like Drive before.  Sure, there are some similarities to other movies.  The soundtrack alone reminds me of something out of Michael Mann's earlier works.  But there's more here than even the pieces of homages to other times could possibly add up to make.  There's been discussion about the very 80's lipstick font chosen for the titles of the film.  I think this was done purposely, to evoke memories of another time.  Drive will transport you away from the everyday into a taut and tense emotional vehicle that will leave you wanting more by the time it all inevitably ends.  Highly recommended and not to be missed!

I think of this as one of the most intense action films made in a good long time, but most can't seem to get past the meditative exposition at all, so much the relatively simple plot structure (which, again, completely baffles me: action movies have no dire need to be as needlessly convoluted as \"Transformers\" or the \"Star Wars\" prequels; everyone needs a little \"Die Hard\" sometimes). It's at the point where I think there's a mutual hatred of the movie based off of its unique direction and popularity with critics. To put it bluntly: if you believe that anyone whose review score is lower than three, you are sadly mistaken. The movie is directed extremely well -- it is a very clean, very tight action film that contrasts the quiet nature of the movie's dialogue with the EXTREME violence (and I do mean extreme -- this is Peckinpah violent). Basically, if you want an action movie that is a little bit different from run-of-the-mill stuff, watch Drive.",

The first scene is good, and might even be great if it weren't followed by 90 minutes of frustrating, boring (and, occasionally, nauseating) cinema. The acting feels like it tries to be minimalistic, pensive, and mysterious; it come off as dull, wooden, and self-important. The movie doesn't go anywhere and doesn't say anything, and remains a \"style over substance\" effort. Unfortunately, even the style is confusing at best: the pink lipstick credits, the Casio synth sound, the cheesy \"Thunderdome\"-style power ballad... if this movie had been made in the 80s, it might have some B-movie credibility. As a movie made 20 years after the 80s ended, Drive feels bewildering and artificial. And that's not even to say anything about the degrading, absurd violence; you don't have to be \"faint of heart\" to be disgusted with the blood spillage in Drive.I rarely have such a visceral reaction to a movie as I did with Drive. I could not for the life of me understand why such a movie is even made, as it is an exercise in empty style... and a D effort at that.",

It was all so glossy and manicured with catchy techno music, but no scene felt like it could ever happen the way it did- from start to finish.

It's a modern western with extremely violent death scenes. It reminded me of Sergio Leone's westerns with the nameless hero at center, cleaning up the mess left behind by very bad people.While Eastwood's Blondie was a silent type without expression, but still likeable, Gosling's nameless hero is pretty silent, but impressively expressive at the same time. He goes through all the motions with real emotion, and even though none of his back story appears, we know that he has a dark past that has driven him into the underworld, into hiding from something terrible, something that always comes back to haunt him. Albert Brooks is surprisingly effective as a cold, cold bastard. I admit getting a little tired of Carey Mulligan, that sweet wife with the sweet kid, and an unfortunate husband. However, I understood why she was important. The characters seemed emotionally invested in each other, which added context to the action. And what an action. The driving was not disappointing, nor the heavy brutality of the killings, which were just as ugly as brutal as killings must be. Nothing attractive about the violence in this film.When watching Ryan Gosling, I feel there is finally an actor comparable with the great Jimmy Stewart. He can both act sweet and cruel, desperate and calm, and at every moment believable. Without Gosling, this would have been just another action movie about a loner seeking justice in an unjust world.",

The biggest flaw is certainly not the acting or cinematography, both are terrific- they make the movie almost bearable. The movie may lack plot, pace and believability. But no- the biggest flaw is far greater than the sum of its parts. It is the desperation. The immense attempt that a young director makes to lure the audience.  Pulsing techno, old school pauses that exist for their own sake, slow motion music-video-esk shots that occur at random moments. They are all meaningless. A movie without a plot cannot be saved by artsy fillers.

A subterfuge of aesthetics covering up a dull pastiche of cliches.    I went in ready to fall in love; neo-noir-ish elements? The Gos? A stylish looking thriller? I figured it couldn't miss. And yes, the first five minutes showed promise. But, for starters, I actually think Gosling did not work in this role; he's very charming and I think this is why people seem to have liked his character. But in reality, all we are given is a mono-syllabic killer; a dull, violent creep. Which is  FINE, that could work. Except, it's far from \"hero/lover/surrogate dad\" mantle that the film is also struggling to hoist on him. A very confused follow-through of what I assume was a pretty great book/initial idea for the film    What part did fans like best? The abandoned race car driver subplot that no seemed interested in anyway? The way that Gosling dons a mask for no practical reason to carry out one of his killings? When that other car shows up mid-robbery for no purpose? (oh, they were going to pull the double-cross on the side of the highway? Smart thinking). That Hendrick's role consists solely of getting slapped by our \"hero\" and then getting her head blown off? Did you like the gritty realism of Carey Mulligan's  90s-emo-pixie-girl-who-also-works-at-Denny's-and-has-a-husband-in-prison aesthetic?  It was so beautiful when the Gos turned that guy's head into mush in front of her, wasn't it?  Did you like how the characters (besides Gosling who, ooh! has a trademark toothpick! Cool!) explained who they were in tight, little speeches so we all knew where we stood? Albert Brooks's hands are \"dirty\" too! From all the violence he carries out as a mobster. Get it?! Oh wait, maybe you liked the soundtrack. Ah yes, you know when the chilled out blissful tune plays and the singer says: \"A real human being and a real hero,\". I just love stuff you don't have to think too much about, you know? (It would be like if in Top Gun, while \"Highway to the Danger Zone\" was playing,  Maverick and Goose were on an actual highway passing a sign that said \"Danger Zone, 20 miles away\") To like this movie is to be easily fooled or just playing it safe to stay on the right side of the prevailing critical response. And, don't worry, you are not alone if you read these response and started to feel like \"Maybe I didn't get it?\" But there is nothing to get. I do love that beautiful Gosling, but you know, sometimes the ones we love...",

Anyone who enjoys this film clearly has an extremely limited knowledge of films. True 'arty' films such as Requiem for a Dream and A Scanner Darkly show what can be achieved with cinematography and a different approach to the formulaic construction of most Hollywood films. Drive merely shows how poorly a film can turn out when the director loses sight of the plot and focuses too much on being different. The result is a film where you feel nothing for the good-as-mute characters, lackluster driving scenes, gratuitously violent, yet brief, action scenes, a nonsensical plot as well as around 20 minutes of unnecessary silence.

I cannot understand what it is about Drive that people enjoyed. At all. I am baffled by the overwhelmingly positive reviews and praise for its \"suspense\" and \"tension\". Not once did I feel even a slight interest or attachment to any character, which I realized about ten minutes in, and hoped would change. Nope. I had gone to see this with another person, at a little independent theater, and at one point thought about walking out. Based on the gasps and chuckles and jolts of the surrounding move-goers, I think I was the only one in that little independent theater who hated what she saw.

The title is misleading because there is very little actual street driving, people should know that.
