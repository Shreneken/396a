  "critic_reviews": [
    "After multiple \"Saw\" franchise releases, writer-director Darren Lynn Bousman goes it alone for 11-11-11, with at best tepid results elaborating an unconvincing premise.",
    "One and one (and one and one and one and one) never quite add up to two in Darren Lynn Bousman's 11-11-11, a rather anemic entry in the biblical-prophecy horror subgenre.",
    "The film has the feel of something conceived and whipped together in very little time, perhaps to make its own built-in deadline.",
    "If only 11-11-11 had arrived a little closer to Thanksgiving - the turkey connection would have been entirely appropriate.",
    "A veteran of the Saw franchise, Darren Lynn Bousman trades torture-porn antics for an old-fashioned Euro-horror vibe, complete with old dark houses and creepy maids; he then wastes what little suspense he generates with endless dorm-room philosophical debates about faith versus atheism and religio-conspiracy theories so far-fetched they'd embarrass Dan Brown."

But if not, watch this. Surprising and with an unpredictable ending (at least  for me, and I'm great in predict endings of films), this film is the kind that makes you need to watch again. Perfect acting, perfect direction, perfect plot. Watch if you sure wants to get surprised. It really looks like \"The Others\", with Nicole Kidman.",

It's hard to pin down exactly what's wrong with this movie because pretty much everything is, from the graphics to the acting, the ahh...\"plot\"...(you'll have it all figured out from the title and the first three minutes of video) to the completely and utterly inept characters, to the mind-blowlingly ridiculous action scenes. If you watch it at all, I suggest watching with friends, having a good laugh, and then shutting it off well shy of the 40 minute mark.",
