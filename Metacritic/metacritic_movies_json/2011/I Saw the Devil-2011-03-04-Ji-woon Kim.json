  "critic_reviews": [
    "Director Kim Jee-woon's astonishing story of a serial killer who picks the wrong man's fiancée to murder, is so extreme and intense that it had to be trimmed down in its native country before it was released to theaters. We lucky westerners get to see it in all its hair-raising, stomach-churning glory, and that's a wonderful thing.",
    "A terrific but uncompromising film that's definitely not for everyone.",
    "If you've got the stomach for it, it's a treat.",
    "A mesmerizing study of the nature of evil itself.",
    "Eventually, Soo-hyun's relentless pursuit-and-release approach outlives the director's skill and the premise starts to feel redundant.",
    "Plenty of people die in I Saw the Devil, but it is that first attack on Ju-yeon in the movie's opening minutes that reverberates through the epic 141-minute running time.",
    "Repugnant content, grislier than the ugliest torture porn, ought to have made the film unwatchable, but it doesn't, simply because Kim's picture is so beautifully filmed, carefully structured and viscerally engaging.",
    "You won't soon forget it -- if you have the guts to see it.",
    "Somewhere in all the blood (sickening realism is a selling point), a question is posed: When does the one fighting a monster become a monster himself?",
    "A droll Nietzschean fable that's fully aware of its lapses into absurdity.",
    "There is all the violent mayhem, for certain, but the thing that sets I Saw the Devil apart is its undercurrent of real emotion and how unrelentingly sad it can be.",
    "Although the sequences grow somewhat repetitive in spite of their vicious escalation, and some of the details challenge believability, I Saw the Devil is a spectacle of substantial merit.",
    "A typical mixture of the artful and the repellent.",
    "A thriller that makes you wish you knew how to scream \"O.M.G.\" in Korean.",
    "Ultimately, the returns of the film's premise can't justify a nearly two-and-a-half-hour squirm. The savagery is honest, raw and hardly entertainment.",
    "But that ending is a whopper all the same: a heartless blast of tragedy, exploitation, amusement, and general flagrance.",
    "An artfully depraved piece of South Korean torture porn directed by Kim Ji-woon, is a skillful serial-killer thriller in keeping with the likes of \"Saw.\"",
    "Never good with nuance, Kim is a beast with disarming imagery but has few resonating ideas, leaving the domino-tumble of brutality to become its own tiresome spectacle.",
    "On any number of levels, \"Devil\" is troublesome at best, offensive at worst."

The violence levelI challenge you how many times do you have to cover your eyes with your hand during thiz film? The movie is so fertile, it makes THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (2009) and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (2010) look like plastic trees. The violence level will shock you to the edge of your seat. A secret agent found his fiancee brutally murdered by the hand of a serial psychopath killer. With all the power he has, the agent hunts down the killer and avenge him through the mercilessly pains he could possibly do. The power of thiz movie is not coming from its story which is predictable but still it leaves you a little twist in the ending, but how The Director describes it so well  and brilliant gritty. The fact is Korea Media Rating Board has forced The Director (Jee-Woon Kim) to cut and edit of violent contents in thiz film. Although after the re-editing, in some scenes still will mark something in your mind, especially the killing scenes and violence against women. It is not a recommended for viewers with the weak of heart. Kim is known for his previous works, such as: A TALE OF TWO SISTERS (2003) and THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE WEIRD (2008). In thiz revenge-thriller, the image is colorful with precise lighting and stunning cinematography. The throbbing score works along harmoniously through every scene. However, the focus of this movie undoubtedly is on two main characters. Both bring a depth of emotion in their character development. As NIS agent, Byung-Hun Lee (who is known as Storm Shadow in G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA (2009)) gives a resolute and complex character, on one side he performs the vengeance without platitude, and on the other side we could see his brittle emotion. As the killer, Min-Sik Choi (who is known as OLDBOY (2003)) provides a convincing crazy psychopath character that is not afraid of anything. It is a perfect role for Choi. Nothing will prepare you for some atrocious scenes. In the end, after seeing thiz film entirely, something will make you realize, who the real Devil is? Is it the killer? Or is it the man who takes revenge to him? Since both of them bring unmerciful heat to their actions. Although they come from different direction and motive, finally they met in the middle anyway, they are the same. It is a good contemplation. Every person has The Devil inside them, the difference is: how far we can tame it?\r Visit My Blog on JONNY MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",

The film Hostel broke new ground but this film ranks high above it but still cares over Hostel's tendencies. This is not for the weak of heart and if you even think that you might be able to bare it, don't because this film will at some point make you cringe. It's pretty much a requirement to close your eyes. Where films like hostel fail horribly this film succeeds. Brilliant action and writing will have you laughing one moment, cheering the next and possibly crying by the end. A mixture of emotions this is a roller-coaster ride for any fan of artistic cinematography, mind blowing action or horror in general. It might be a foreign film but please don't miss out on this amazing overall experience. This film right now is on Netflix Instant so please check it out!!!",

They write a lot of things about the violence and obscure scenes and they totally miss the point of the movie. You cant summarize this movie with what you see, it needs to take a count for what it makes you feel.Yes the movie is very violent, very bloody. It will make you cover your eyes of obscenity. Those scenes set up the movie to the emotions you the viewer needs to be in to understand the point of the movie. I think the writer wants to make your mind go to dark places, very dark places. It want's you to scream \"REVENGE\" and \"MAKE HIM SUFFER\" and the beauty of the movie is that it does this, perfectly. When the movie comes closer to a conclusion the main point of the movie is revealing it self. You can't get revenge, all you have done to try to get revenge has made you loose even more. All the suffering you inflicted to the villain wont make him regret what he did or ever fear what you will do to him. \"You lost already\" is the line that says it all.The movie is a breath of fresh air, one of the best movies i have ever seen. It takes you through a journey to dark places and at the end makes you regret all the dark thoughts the movie made you think.",

One man sets out to try after losing his fiancé to a demented serial killer and rapist. What he begins to find out is that his quest for revenge could change him forever. Turning him into the very thing he seeks to destroy. It's a moral quandary we've seen before, but rarely at this level of unflinching brutality. Make no mistake, you will most definitely see the devil because this movie is a trip through hell.Kim Jee-woon shows us the darkest, most unsafe side of the world. Secluded areas where a seemingly endless array of psychopaths own the night and collect as many victims as possible. The content is incredibly graphic and I'm not just talking about the violence. Torture and gore are certainly the foremost vices the sick predators of this film like to engage in, but they have a tendency to explore other disturbing perversions as well. Such as sexual assault, cannibalism, and even pedophilia.It's a dark and grotesque movie for sure, but there's a certain absurdity to it. While never an easy watch, a pitch black sense of humor keeps the harsh content from ever becoming too much to handle. At least for the more seasoned viewer. I did notice where it went too far with the joke on one occasion. The almost cartoonish mishandling of a severed head by a member of a forensics team that causes it to come spilling out for all to see was in bad taste. For the most part though these more comedic moments do a lot to a touch of lightness to what could have otherwise been an overbearingly revolting experience.The two lead performances are incredible. Lee Byung-hun is a sympathetic lead even at his lowest point because of the emotion he brings to the character. Choi Min-sik is hands down one of the most terrifying serial killers in all of cinema. He's menacing, dangerous, and creepy. They're the perfect rivals. Both fundamentally broken in different ways with unrelenting natures destined to the downfall of them both. Their battle to ruin the other person is an action-packed and tense ride right up until the unforgettable conclusion. No one wins in this exploration of depravity and vengeance. No one but the audience that is. 9.2/10",

Okay guys, its maybe another revenge movie... If you haven't seen I Saw the Devil, you might think this will be yet another typical movie of the genre, BUT its not, its unique, and I think its one of the best movies of its genre. The director of I Saw the Devil was the guy who also directed A Bittersweet Life (which I also give a 10/10) and also The Good, The Bad, The Weird. The movie is packed full of solid acting with my favourite Korean actor Byung-hun Lee as the main character who plays as a tragic secret agent who seeks for revenge at all costs.The antagonist is brilliantly acted by Min-sik Choi who plays as a psycho killer in the movie, he played the main role of the famous Old Boy in the past.The movie has an original but intense story which shows you how cruel humans can be, it has a meaning to it at the end of the day.I don't wanna say much about the story because I don't wanna spoil it for you, but it has a very tragic, intense and sadistic story. The movie has quite a few action scenes which are perfectly presented, and shows how much the main character hungers for vengeance. The scenes all have amazing Choreography in them and has one of the most entertaining scenes I've seen in a while.Don't think about watching it if you can't bare blood and gore. It is one of the grimmest movies I have seen, this is not a bad thing. It is not mindless gore as the violence and killings was created so that the audience sees really how sadistic the villian is.10/10",

Of course, in the last 20 minutes the movie perfectly shifts gears into a suspenseful thrill ride, and the conclusion will leave you horrified like any good thriller should. I absolutely loved this movie. It was violent, twisted, and thrilling as hell. I don't remember a time where I've been shocked so many times during a movie. \"I Saw the Devil\" keeps you horrified, and when it doesn't do that, it holds you in suspense. Besides delivering the typical revenge message of \"Vengeance doesn't solve anything,\" it also delivers a more subtle message. Don't mess with South Koreans.",

It happens in most Hollywood horror movies were they try to show how brutal and dark they can get, put it just comes off torture porn. I think it's best for movies to have a reason for the use of gore and not make it mindless. The Human Centipede movies are a perfect example of what not to do with mixing gore and story. Until I sawed the 2010 film I Saw the Devil in which it has it's gory parts but it never felt like it's over doing it, and that's what I wanted for dark movies like this.\r The director of the movie Ji-woon Kim who directed such movies like: The Good, The Bad and the Weird and The Last Stand. I only seen two of he's films and that's this movie and The Last Stand, but I haven't seen The Good, The Bad and the Weird yet. But anywhere Ji-woon Kim directed this movie with that sense of cold revenge which set up the tone perfectly for a film like this. Every shot in this movie is shot excellently and it's sometimes beauty and sometimes ugly, I mean this movie dose have a serial killer killing dozen of people and of course it's going to be ugly unless your Hannibal the TV show that you can make that ugliness into art, but it can be beauty with the open shot view of Korean even if it takes place in a environment of snow falling which is beauty to see or just outside. Ji-woon Kim directed the action scenes really well and smoothly and I got to say it's much better than most action movies are filmed today and I always love fight scenes from Korean or different kind of countries, because they fight scenes are quick, well performed, it get's you glued to the screen because it's that good and it's just awesome, and Ji-woon Kim did a excellent job directing at matching the tone and the action scene together perfectly.\r Byung-hun Lee who I have seen before but not in such good movies like: The G.I Joe movies and Red 2. But in this movie I actually sawed him delivered a solid and heart breaking performance that Byung-hun Lee really humanist he's character that I can feel he's pain and fury against this killer who ruined his life. But without spoiling anything Byung-hun Lee crying at the end was hard not to laugh I mean he looked like he was smile or something, if you seen the movie then you know what I mean. Everything else was good but that cry at the end which made me laugh a little. Besides that Byung-hun Lee gave a strong performance that even I forget that cry at the end.\r Choi Min Sik the main serial killer of the movie delivered both treating and a uncomfortable performance that at times made me think that he wasn't acting at all he was that good. He played the devil like serial killer so well that I can picture him in real life doing all these crimes. Choi Min Sik did a excellent performance in the movie that's chilling and unforgettable.\r Now this movie does have a strong hold of blood and little bit of gore that some viewers may be turned off by. This movie isn't for everyone and I understand it may not be they type of movie to watch. I would only recommend this movie to people who love a dark gritty revenge film.\r Now for the problems: What really took me out of the movie is how many times the serial killer get's smashed in the head by a metal object or by anything that can knock your teeth out or kill you. I'm not kidding you this guy is evil but still human and some many times he get's tortured a little bit and get's brutally injured in the head which starts bleeding, but somehow he's okay after that. I know it's a small little problem but to me it's big enough for me to talk about it.\r Overall I Saw the Devil is a gritty crime drama that it's sometimes hard to watch and hard to take in with the level of grittiness that's in the movie, and that's what made this movie both great and brilliant.",

In a way, this film is a Korean adaptation of The Silence of the Lambs in the sense that it revolves around a detective’s interactions with a cannibalistic serial killer. However, if you couldn’t stomach The Silence of the Lambs then this is certainly not the film for you as it jumps right into it with graphically grizzly scenes. Min-Sik’s character lures a young woman into his van and knocks her unconscious. She wakes, fettered in an impromptu shelter located in a sewer, to her assailant looming over her. He makes quick work of her, chopping her up, but not before her hand, with her engagement ring on it, is carried away into the sewer system. We find out that she had been engaged to a high-ranking detective, as played by Byung-Hun. What follows is a vindictive game of cat and mouse between the detective and killer, ending in the killer’s associate’s lair, wherein the associate keeps a store of young women for his and his dogs’ later consumption. The detective is successful in his capture of the killer; however, the tables soon turn as the killer escapes and seeks to get even for the pain the detective has inflicted upon him. As the battle of brains and brawns draws to a close, the detective eventually gets vengeance, but at a cost. The film’s cinematography is unique and well-composed. However, the most notable elements of the film are the fight scenes and grotesquely real effects. This film manages to accomplish what many Hollywood films fail to do: provide a constantly engaging narrative and good choreography in a horror or horror adjacent film.",

It delivers on a whole other level, talk about pain and suffering manifested in the most horrific and gutwrenching way, I've seen my share of revenge films, and many of them lose focus on what's important, which is the emotions, this film highlights that in a significant way, to a point where you find yourself invested in the story, you expect a certain feeling, you crave it, the need for satisfaction is overwhelming, what it essentially does is awaken this deep-rooted primal need for revenge that I'm sure that every one of us possess, it is absolutely amazing to see a film provoke such a reaction from its viewers.Let's talk a little bit about the characters. This film has fantastic performances across the board, from the minor characters to the leads, you can tell that the director invested a lot towards the cast and it pays off, but what stands out the most here is the depiction of a psychopath, Choi Min-Sik who plays the antagonist performs flawlessly as he dives in his diabolical persona, this by far one of the best showcases of a psychopath in recent years.This film left me in a state of awe. Everything about seems to fit perfectly with its theme, exceptional movie.",

This film is a brutal revenge film, and there isn't much else to it. \"I Saw The Devil\" comes off as very cheesy, the dialogue unfortunately has a lot of exposition, and the script is filled with confusing story hiccups. There is some emotion, and there is notable scene elements. The movies tone is dark, but the violence seemed to serve no purpose other then pointless gore. There is no real character depth, and the visuals are bland and uninspired.",

I do wish the agent wouldn't have let him go to murder and hurt more people. That made absolutely no sense. But... It is the point of the movie, catch and release. Great gore, great acting, just a unique horrific film. Highly recommended. That being said I doubt I'll re-watch. Just a good one time watch.",
