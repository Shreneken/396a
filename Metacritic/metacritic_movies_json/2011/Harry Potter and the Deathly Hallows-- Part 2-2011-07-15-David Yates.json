  "critic_reviews": [
    "The epic and impassioned close that the saga deserves, a sweeping Wagnerian finish that's taut with suspense and wet with emotion.",
    "A dazzling, stirring capper to a once-in-a-generation movie franchise.",
    "This outing not only doesn't disappoint; it surpasses high expectations. This is a terrific, smartly designed adolescent adventure, visually rich, narratively satisfying, and bound to resonate for years to come.",
    "Writer Steve Kloves, who adapted all of J.K. Rowling's novels except \"Order of the Phoenix\" over the last 11 years, neither wastes a word nor leaves out any essentials.",
    "Considering Parts 1 and 2 of Deathly Hallows as a single enterprise, as they should be, this is a rare franchise that just kept getting better.",
    "The final Harry Potter movie, above all others, supplies Radcliffe with the gravitas of not just an epic story come to completion, but some real dramatic heft. Not so bad for a Hogwarts dropout.",
    "Part II gets everything right to send off Harry on a cinematic high.",
    "It's a climax of truly epic proportions.",
    "Everything a summer blockbuster should be but rarely is - a whip-smart, slam-bang piece of entertainment where we deeply care about the fate of the central characters.",
    "Fully justifying the decision, once thought purely mercenary, of splitting J.K. Rowling's final book into two parts, this is an exciting and, to put it mildly, massively eventful finale that will grip and greatly please anyone who has been at all a fan of the series up to now.",
    "The thrilling conclusion to a phenomenal cinematic story 10 years in the telling, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 is proof that authentic movie excitement is its own form of magic.",
    "Childhood ends, this time forever, with tears and howls, swirls of smoke, the shock of mortality and bittersweet smiles in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, the grave, deeply satisfying final movie in the series.",
    "The movie's final moments are the equivalent of the half-jubilant, half-mournful thrill you get when you close the cover of a book you've savored.",
    "Cinematographer Eduardo Serra underscores the sense of dread with a rich charcoal palette, and the outstanding CGI and 3D effects make the otherworldly threats more corporeal.",
    "It is indeed impressive; and we mean not just this solid, satisfying final film - in which the Potter saga reaches its climax, if not quite its emotional apex - but the entirety of producer David Heyman's blockbuster franchise.",
    "Like the previous seven movies, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 obliviates the line between art and craft, but the witchcraft conjured for this satisfying finale is uniquely generous.",
    "The ideal culmination of a fantasy series that has artfully blended excitement, adventure and terror with humor, kinship and love.",
    "This movie is impressively staged, the dialogue is given proper weight and not hurried through, there are surprises which, in hindsight, seem fair enough, and \"Harry Potter\" now possesses an end that befits the most profitable series in movie history.",
    "It's virtually non-stop action, though director David Yates, who has taken good care of these final four, ever-meaner Potter adventures, does a very crafty thing, following adapter Steve Kloves' screenplay.",
    "What an exhilarating gift to watch Harry and Company go out in a blaze of glory and amazing grace.",
    "Overall, Part 2 tells a more compelling and emotionally fulfilling tale than the one related in Part 1, although that could be a result of this movie having a conclusion - something its predecessor notably lacked.",
    "Although not blessed with a cinematic eye, Yates, a sensitive director of actors, structures his movie like the final movement of a symphony. He reprises themes and characters from the previous films that swell in the epochal siege of Hogwarts and ends his films with an almost wordless coda that will wring tears even from Harry haters.",
    "The fact that Yates marshals a mile-long grocery list of business with the grace and poise of an orchestra conductor, and makes it look easy, isn't just flattery, it's an indication of his method.",
    "A fitting, expertly made final chapter, freighted with hard-won emotions, shot through with a sense of farewell, and fully aware of the epic stakes involved.",
    "And so the saga of Harry Potter comes to an end - not with a whimper but with a rousing thunderclap of incident, emotion, suspense and old-fashioned movie magic.",
    "The excellent news is that Yates and company took their time adding visual depth to the film -- they shot it as 3-D -- and the result feels immediate and real and not at all slathered-on.",
    "When the movie was over, a young boy sitting behind me said, \"That was great!\" He was satisfied, and rightly so.",
    "Part 2 of The Deathly Hallows, is the best possible end for the series that began a decade ago.",
    "Part 2 turns out to be more than the last of its kind. Almost magically, it ends up being one of the best of the series as well.",
    "It's always hard to predict how a work of art will age over time, but I have the feeling that, like its three young leads, the Harry Potter series will turn out just fine.",
    "It's wonderful. Epic and heartbreaking and just as grand as it needs to be.",
    "With shifting loyalties, unlikely heroes, truths revealed and a little help from friends, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 winds the series up in a most-satisfying fashion.",
    "HPATDH 2 works like a charm. A funereal charm, to be sure, but then, there's no time left for larks.",
    "A worthy farewell that packs in as much action as its seven predecessors combined and manages not to stint on the emotional beats. Harry Potter leaves us as a quiet, bespectacled, corduroy-wearing hero for the ages.",
    "With its accelerated rhythm, relentless flow of incident and wizard-war endgame, \"Part 2\" will strike many viewers as a much more exciting, involving picture than the slower, more atmospheric \"Part 1.\"",
    "Part 2 is something else altogether. Such digital effects as the marauding giants that squash baby wizards like bugs or the inky terror that is the Death Eaters – acolytes to the mad, bad wizard Voldemort (Fiennes) – are magnificent and experienced in one long, clutched breath. But what's missing is what has been the chief pleasure of the series: the chemistry between its young leads.",
    "With its heartening final note of hope and renewal, Deathly Hallows -- Part 2 provides an altogether fitting finale to a series that has prized the fans above all.",
    "The awesome effects take over where the plot used to be, and although this is the end, my guess is that it will fire the imagination for years to come. What fun to feel like a kid again. I had a marvelous time.",
    "The finale to the Harry Potter saga is, like most of the films in the series, a bit of a slog. But it's a generally satisfying slog.",
    "So ends this enormously important, and enormously extended, chapter of pop culture, with a combination of bang and whimper."

However, I have watched every film so I've managed to keep up with the series.  As a result, I will rate this AS A FILM rather than a book adaptation.  As a film, this is fantastic on every front.  Splitting the film into two parts was the best thing they could've done.  I felt the first part had a couple of pacing issues, but was still pretty great.  This one is perfectly paced.  I was gripped constantly.  A fantastic balance of story and action.  Every character was excellent portrayed and I really felt that each one of them had a good level of depth. The script was also fantastic.  It never felt clichÃ©, the amount of humour was just right and it's just overall very well written.  The action, the story, the character development, the romance, the humour.  It's all so perfectly balanced.  Nothing ever felt forced.  Overall this is a phenomenal film.  Every Harry Potter fan should see this, and even if you aren't a fan, watch it because it's a GOOD film (though I would recommend at least watching a couple of the previous films beforehand to have some sort of an idea of what's going on).",

The HogwartsI am convinced that the critics who have raved about this movie and have given it such positive reviews haven't actually read the books. This movie diverges from the actual book way more than I could appreciate as a HP fan. The Hogwarts battle scenes seem to be the director's own version of the events rather than a recreation of the book (if you've seen the trailers, you would have suspected as much). Unfortunately, while the first four movies brilliantly followed the books (given the time constraints of a movie), ever since director David Yates got involved, the movies have moved away from the books (Half Blood Prince being a great example of Yates doing his own thing). Deathly Hallows 2 in my view does an even poorer job of visually recreating the book than Half Blood Prince did. In summary a most disappointing end to the Harry Potter years",

Without reading the books I can't say how much was left out.  But what I can say is that, while the books are incredible (from what I hear), most movies are not true screen adaptations that capture everything that might be important or wonderful from the text.  Yates did a wonderful job wrapping up the series.  Deathly Hallows Part 2 comes off as more engaging and more fun than Part 1 as a movie, given that there is a lot more going on, and ultimately ends up being one of the most enjoyable Harry Potter films of the whole series.  I would have gladly given another 20 minutes for Yates & crew to explain and appropriately tie up the entire story as many fans (both those who enjoyed and were disappointed) have commented on.  But what's done is done.  It's not quite perfect, but it's a wonderful and successful ending to what has been one of the most important adaptations ever.  I'll certainly miss seeing the world and characters of Harry Potter in new ways, but at least there were so many films to give breath visually to a series JK Rowling created... and in the scope of a childrens novel.  The movie is great, and it leaves you wanting more as it makes an exit in \"styyyle\".",

This isn't perfectly judged but the vast majority of it has been and it is an exceptionally well made blockbuster with enough soul to match the heavy effects that feature this time. However what is really testament to the success of not just this film but also of the whole series, is that the quieter and more character drive moments really outshine the action and spectacle. Exceptional performances from the whole cast and it has a rousing and satisfying conclusion. It's a shame not all the secondary characters get the send off most would have liked but it is a minor quibble. A powerful end to a mighty series.",

The best part of the movie for me were the performances of Alan Rickman as Snape (especially during the scene in the Pensive) and Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort which were both perfect.

Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is back, along with his best friends; Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), after escaping the Malfoy's house and moving on from the tragic death of Dobby in the hands of Bellatrix (Helena Bonham Carter), the search for the remaining horcruxes continue.As their search for the last few horcruxes continue, Harry discovers that Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is closer to him than he thinks, when they need to get back to Hogwarts to find the remaining horcruxes, they meet a mysterious man who goes by the name Aberforth Dumbledore (Ciaran Hinds), Albus' brother. Aberforth, as it seems, was not very close to his late brother, and raises the suspicion that Albus (Michael Gambon) was not to be trusted as he has kept many secret things from Harry. But Harry claims that he trusted the man he knew. On their way back to Hogwarts, Neville (Matthew Lewis) leads them back, and it seems that the school has become a war zone. Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) has become the headmaster since he killed Dumbledore, and informs the students that if they know Harry's whereabouts and even attempts to help him, they will be punished. Then the war begins, Harry destroys as many of the last remaining horcruxes that he could find, he discovers the truth about one particular Hogwarts professor, and he finally comes face to face with his nemesis, Voldemort. 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2' is a worthy finale to a long running franchise. Director, David Yates has crafted the most exciting movie in the chapter, the most exciting since 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' (2005), and the events unfold in a clean and fast-paced fashion. Fans of the franchise will love what they see. No finale has truly felt more dramatic and emotionally satisfying at the same time... this is the winner of all finales.",

Now to the parts that I didn't really like. Fred Weasley and Lupin's death.They died in a very anticlimactic way. It wasn't as sad as it was supposed to be. These two are important characters. They just showed their dead bodies and that's it. Another thing is that Malfoy, Hagrid and other supporting characters didn't appear that much. The epilogue is something that I have mixed feelings about. It was in the book and I think it gave the film makers a hard time. The cool thing about the epilogue is seeing how the characters grew and seeing their children going to their same school. The not-so-good thing is that the actors looked silly. The boys (Harry, Ron and Malfoy) looked like normal adults but the girls looked almost the same. Hermione looks like she didn't even age. But the epilogue and other minor bad things didn't ruin the film for me. Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows Part 2 is great film and a good and satisfying conclusion to the series.",

The main reason being that, given the movie was split into two films for the purpose of staying true to the book, there was still many variations to Rowling's text in Hallows Part 2. These variations however, proved to make the movie more action orientated, cinematic and easy to understand for fans of the movies and not the books. I am only disappointed at the fact that because of past movies, Hallows Part 2 needed to tie loose ends in accordance with what was seen on screen and not in the books. As an adaptation, I feel somewhat cheated, due to the fact that the text was so rich with detail that went unseen in the film. As an action film however, Hallows Part 2 does extremely well. The main plot-line is still there, and I am pleased that Yates really delivered in the final battle. (In the book, the final battle is not as tense nor engaging and I commend Yates for his work). Soundtrack was magnificent, which really added to certain scenes in the film, especially 'Snapes Memories' and the scene where Harry  knew he was going to die. These amendments all add to the missing scenes from the text, which makes this film a fitting finale.",

There was incredible hype for The Deathly Hallows Part 2 ever since the final scenes of the DH 1, and itIt all has to end, every single minute of the 18 hour-long Harry Potter movies preceding this one have been leading up to this moment. There was incredible hype for The Deathly Hallows Part 2 ever since the final scenes of the DH 1, and it has the impossible task of meeting the expectations that it has set for itself which is incredibly high. This is the perfect way to end the best movie franchise ever made. It's amazing to actually take a step back and look at all of the 8 movies, it never drops in quality and the shifts in the tone of the movies is just bloody awesome from the Sorcerer's Stone's light, funny, cheerful tone to the very dark and serious tone of the Half-Blood Prince, and Deathly Hallows 1 and 2. As always Mr Yates gets into the thick of the action and assumes that the audience knows everything and literally picks up where DH1 ended. Hogwarts surrounded by hovering Dementors and a despondent-looking new headmaster Severus Snape, cue the title sequence. You know you're in good hands. For the fans who did not like the DH1 citing a lack of action sequences and a slow dragging story (I really enjoyed DH1) will be satisfied with this one. Almost immediately it starts with a break-in into Gringotts bank with Harry and a creepy looking goblin on his back under the invisibility cloak, Ron wearing a goatee and Hermione taking the form of Bellatrix Lestrange via the polyjuice potion. Helena Bonham Carter was absolutely amusing impersonating Emma Watson's character impersonating her. Searching for a horcrux, followed swiftly by an abrupt escape plan with the trio holding on for dear life on a dragon. Action sequence junkies you'll love this movie. The special effects in this one is great, amazing looking wand duels, knights, trolls and everything in between as Hogwarts is turned into a battlefield not dissimilar to the Lord of the Rings' movies. The calm before the storm is very similar to The Two Towers when they're preparing for the arrival of Voldermort and his posse, everything is so well-paced and the story just flows effortlessly. But even with all that in abundance, the heart of the movie will always be in the close intimate scenes, the CGI effects will never upstage the emotional core of the movie, two life-long friends finally share a tender moment, a boy circled by his deceased family and his reunion with the man he so much admired and so much more. There are a lot of deaths and I'm quite surprised that a fair amount of them occurs off screen, probably it's supposed to give a much stronger impact but I really wanted to see the demise of some of them. All in all the story was very solid and so unbelievably satisfying. Desplat's score, hauntingly magnificent. Truly beautiful and laced with bits from John Williams' and Nicholas Hooper's pieces, reminding us of much simpler and happy times and when everything came crashing down respectively. Eduardo Serra's cinematography is phenomenal, really capturing the look and feel of the movie as he did in part 1, you really feel that death is coming for Hogwarts. The stand-out performance for DH 1 was Emma Watson, DH 2 is where Daniel Radcliffe really shines. Harry Potter is no longer just the boy who lived, he's grown into a man on a mission, now equipped with a sense of authority and no one really questions him anymore, it's best to let him do what needs to be done. The negotiation scene with the goblin and with Mr. Ollivander was just so intense and delicately captured on screen showcasing a different side to Mr. Radcliffe. He was given a lot of dramatic and emotionally-heavy scenes and he really delivered, this was his movie along with Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, who have been in their roles for 10 years now, their casting really made the movie what it is. And let's not forget the most impressive supporting cast ever assembled with a slew of great British actors, you know who they are. Ralph Fiennes is menacing as the immortal Lord Voldermort but every time a Horcrux is destroyed he gets progressively weaker and Mr Fiennes' performance is very delicate showing the Dark Lord's vulnerability. Then there was the half-blood prince's revelatory piece which almost reduced me to tears. That was a heart-breaking montage of Snape's agendas and his sacrifices. Alan Rickman was outstanding showing the deeper, more emotional side of Severus Snape, give the man an Oscar already. For those that have been following ever since the first movie, the reward here is extremely gratifying. The epilogue of the movie which was set 19 years later was very bittersweet, did'tt want it to end. The final few moments before the screen faded to black, and before the sun sets on the best franchise ever made I also felt that the sun was setting on my childhood, saw the first movie when I was 10 years old, and it ended with the end of my teen years. I grew up with the movies. What a ride it has been, goodbye Harry Potter..",

Along the way, he met Ron Weasley and Hermonie Granger, who became his party companions as he quested to learn more about himself and come closer to his ultimate destiny; to kill Lord Voldemort.This one was a very emotional, but beautiful ending to a series that a majority of people my age grew up with, and it added more to its grand power by great direction, an excellent scrript, and powerful acting (especially from Alan Rickman, who really impressed me with his performance in both parts. I actually began to sympathize with Professor Snape when they showed his backstory from his last tear, as it almost made me cry), along with top-notch visual effects and a grand score.I can easily call this the best movie of the year, and I hope that people don't miss their last chance to see the boy wizard (unless they decide to reboot the series 20 years from now, which will anger a lot of people, including myself).So, in total, if I give this one 5 stars and the first part a 4-star rating, that would make the 2 parts together a 4.5 out of 5, which is solid for a Harry Potter film considering all the others except the 4th (never watched Azkaban) were not all that great.Harry had a good run, quite an impressive one at that.Part 1: B+Part 2: ATogether: A-",

I also thought that Part 2 was overall a very good and enjoyable movie with some phenomenal effects and several outstanding performances. That said, I am in utter shock at the overwhelmingly positive reviews here and particularly at Rotten Tomatoes. The movie was quite good, but it nonetheless had some glaring flaws. The pacing was off throughout the movie, the attempts at humor were mostly complete failures, and some of the changes made from the books were poorly considered. ***SPOILER ALERT***Positives: Helena Botham Carter as Hermione - best performance of the movie, with the right type of humor; the dragon escape from Gringots - brilliant effects and understated emotional and thematic elements; Alan Rickman - no more need be said; Warwick Davis - his biggest role in the movies yet, and he's great. The stone knights of Hogwarts, and all of the other visual effects.Negatives: Gringots was rushed, sense of danger too understated. How/why did Luna end up back at Hogwarts? Attempts at humor that distracted from the tone of the movie. Humor in a movie like this needs to shake one slightly out of their funk, laugh inside, and slingshot back into the dark mood with a reminder of the lightness that might yet be, not make a crowd laugh out loud or giggle (for examples, see almost anything done by Joss Whedon, or in the HP books themselves). Molly Weasley first being timid when approaching Bellatrix, then smiling after killing her just for a crowd-pleasing \"yay\" moment - not in character or tone. Finally, the last battle was too scattered and not nearly as good as in the book. Why not take advantage of a brilliantly written scene in which Neville is being burned under the sorting hat, with the rapid and dramatic change when he takes it off in defiance and removes the sword unexpectedly? Why send Ron and Hermione to try to kill Nagini when the surprise and shock of Neville killing her right in front of Voldemort would have been wonderful? This scene was drawn out by being stuffed with action, when it could have been paced properly to stress the emotions of the characters and the stakes instead. Instead of honest moments of triumph, we get false and contrived feeling moments.Final positive: The epilogue - recaptured the spirit of innocence and magic, bringing the story full-circle. This was the one part of the story I felt was delivered better in the movie than in the book.",

To all the fans who are upset about the ways the film divulges from the book, these changes were made with enormous respect to the source material and with the intention of making it a better MOVIE - more fast-paced, and with a more satisfying, suspenseful climax. The last book was one of my favorites, largely for the dense plot and character nuance that was (not entirely, but somewhat) absent from the film, but I can say that this is one of those rare cases where the changes made were almost entirely for the better. The parts that felt awkward, overly-complex, or overly-convenient in the book are reworked in a way that flows organically, without sacrificing the emotional impact. Almost every character has their moment to shine, and the most heartbreaking scenes from the book are played to perfection (Alan Rickman is outstanding) - it's intense, scary, funny, sad, and above all, satisfying to the people who have spent their childhoods with Harry.

WithIt All Ends Here! Sadly, it does all come to an end but the Harry Potter franchise surpasses every expectation and delivers a grandstand finale of epic proportion in what is an unmissable and unforgettable film experiences of all time. With all the high expectations heading into The Deathly Hallows Part 2 it seemed impossible that this film could end up doing what does. Picking up from the tragic ending of Part 1 the film with Harry, Ron and Hermione searching for the remaining Horcruxes to destory Voldemort and Yates sets the tone very early on with an all out action raid on Gringotts bank. The only minor issue that I had with Part 1 was the pacing but this film runs at a very smooth and fast pace. One of the elements Yates displays very convincingly is the transformation in the atmosphere and feeling for the film. Long gone are the happy times of Quidditch, instead you now have the dark, gloomy skies, dragons, death-eaters and the Dark Lord himself. This works a treat because it not only emphasizes that this is the finale to this spectacular series but it makes it much more serious. There light-hearted moments but their timed to perfection and the focus is purely on the the final battle. And that is were this film excels overwhelmingly! The battle scenes were just extraordinary. Visually its encapsulating and mezmerising and once again gets across the epicness of this film. Its been compared to the LotR battle and rightly so its simply oustanding. The story was very well written, Yates manages to combine the story, the pace, the action and the acting incredibly well. One standout, as per usual, is Alan Rickman arguably the greatest performance of the Potter franchise as Severus Snape, he is magic as Snape as his true motives are revealed in what has to be some of the most emotional and poignant scenes of the movie but Daniel Radcliffe has his moment and delivers his best performance saving his best for last, he takes centre stage in the final third and is actually magestic. And there is plenty of emotion as expected after all this is it, the final Potter outing! There are sacrifices, deaths of much loved and maligned faces who we have come to love as well as the romance as Ron and Hermione share that much anticapted kiss. All this leading to the epic showdown between Harry Potter, the boy wonder, and Lord Voldemort. The epilogue in closing the film is very bittersweet seeing each character 19 years down the line was very moving as they sent their kids to Hogwarts but it brought this amazing series of films to a fantastic finish. In closing, I urge any film fan to see this movie. It is utterly essential to see the ending to this epic series. They have certainly saved the best for last and ensure that the greatest film franchise of all time ends in spectular and spell binding style! This film has everything a finale should have and will be remembered for years to come. Having grown up with the series since I was a little kid its sad to bid Harry and co farewell but Im left fully fulfilled and admiring the achievement they have delivered in this epic franchise.

IWell it is finally over, what a ride it has been. I cannot say I have grown up with Harry Potter as when it was first released (Chamber of secrets) I had little interest in what I thought was going to be a kids movie, oh how I was wrong. I think the problem with the Harry Potter series is just how a lot of people overlook the sometimes subtle, sometimes painfully obvious undertones and hidden meanings of the scenes and characters. The dementors sucking life out of people like depression for example. I do genuinely believe JK Rowling to be an incredible writer with such an amazing imagination, anyway back to DH2. From the start scene to the end you will be gripped by a fast but well paced action/realistic depiction of war. Even more realistic than most war films out there. The number of casualties, the damage, the destruction and the bravery and terror. If you want to go and watch a film where you will find yourself upset one moment followed closely by a sense of joy then this is definitely the movie for you. How many times I must have been on the verge of crying followed shortly by a one liner that simply picked me up. I do not want to give anything away for those of you out there who do not know how this ends. All I can say is ignore any negative reviews go out and see it for yourself, you will be left amazed. After 10 years of waiting and 18 hours of watching Harry and friends grow up I think its time we owed it to ourselves to say our goodbyes and DH2 does this in style. A brilliant movie with fantastic cast, visuals and pace. Do yourself a favour book tickets now as I have a feeling this one will be around in cinemas across the UK for a while to come :). Enjoy.",

Adding more to the (excuse the clichÃ©) cauldron each year, and this movie was no exception. It is fair to admit that part one was a little bit of a lackluster, and needed a lot more conviction and vitality. It only really had you on the edge of your comfy cinema seat toward the penultimate scene where Dobby tragically dies. However part 2 had a lot more to it, chucking you right in the deep end from the get go, which is to expect when the movie starts half way through a book, nonetheless it still gripped the audience a lot better than the first.Similarly to the first though, it does drag on a bit a quarter of the way through, with the only thing keeping you interested is the concept, the objective, what you know is coming (which is explained to you at the beginning) the mission to Gringots was a fantastic way for David Yates to grab the audienceâ",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nOf course this movie was going to be brilliant, the final instalment of a world famous series of a boy wizard saw the good finally overcome the bad. Seeing the actors growing up onscreen and how their characters evolve over the 7 years at Hogwarts, the series has been a world wide success. And rightly so. Deathly Hallows part 2 certainly lives up to expectations. Fast-paced, funny/emotional/action-packed, visually stunning and the acting seemed better than in previous instalments as well. But it's not without it's problems. The sound seemed to be unusually quiet for an action film, like the Foley artists were taking a long break. The scene with the dragon escaping Gringott's is the best example. There was no urgency to the chaos the dragon was causing. This scene also was over-played. The suspense was over-drawn resulting in knowing when the dragon would burst through the floor of the bank. That would have been a perfect moment to make the audience jump but sadly that did not happen. The music playing over the big fighting scenes also seemed out of place, the sound and the visuals  just didn't match. I was expecting something like with the orchestral power and bravery as heard from LOTR but ended up feeling like the power struggle really wasn't that much of a struggle. Some big opportunities were missed during these big battle moments too. Whereas in the books the reader could feel emotion and loss for the characters that inevitably die (Fred, Lupin, Tonks), here the emotional range was contained to a mere side-effect. Viewers who haven't read the books are surely to be confused too. Horcruxes and wand law are explained in a hurried fashion, leaving the viewer feeling a few steps behind on the action. It's not to say the film hasn't got it's good points (I gave it 9/10 after all!). The audience clapped when Mrs Weasley called Bellatrix Lestrange a **** laughed at Filch earnestly sweeping away the ruinous remains of the castle, and cheered for Dame Maggie Smith who finally gets some decent screen time and a little bit of the action as a Professor who gets to unleash her power \"I've always wanted to do that!\"\r However, it is the delectable Alan Rickman who takes the film to a whole new level as Professor Snape. Taking us through his painful back story, how he struggled to hide his feelings for Harry's mother and his turmoil over doing what he had to do to gain the Dark Lord's trust. Real sympathy is earned for this character, the portrayal making Snape more than just a villain but 3D and actually human.\r Lastly, not forgetting the kid actors. Sorry young adults....well actually old adults as well - that final scene is quite unnerving. Daniel, Emma and Rupert portray a new maturity whilst also retaining the original essences of their characters. They play off each other really well, both in the light-hearted scenes as well as the dark ones. They make all the wand-waving and running/duck-and-cover scenes look natural and fun and convey the struggles, both emotional and physical, with depth and poignancy, like when Harry meets and talks with all the dead people he has known.\r Visually the film is effects laden and stunning, as expected, and in 3D you get to feel even closer to the action. Dialogue is witty, touching, and keeps pace with the action sequences well. The set pieces, particularly Gringott's Bank and Hogwarts, and fighting scenes are awe-inspiring. Harry Potter is one of the franchises made for the big screen and it surely doesn't let you down.\r It's during one of the final scenes, after Voldemort is vanquished, Harry, Ron and Hermione stand on a ruined bridge of the castle looking out towards their future, their friendship never looking so tight and content. We can feel relief with them. And that's what the whole of the series has been about. The three of them standing together no matter what, weathering the trials and trubulations of school, teenage years and pure evil. That's hard to come by, even in a world of fantasy. I'm going to miss Hogwarts....it's the end of the Potter era, and what a great ending it was.",

It's become a series that has magically bounded itself to our hearts through the masterful and brilliant directing of Chris Columbus (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets), Alfonso CuarÃ³n (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), Mike Newell (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), and David Yates whose far-fetched brilliance has distanced himself far beyond the other directors, producing the best and biggest grossing films in the series. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Yates manages to perfectly balance action with wit, a balance lacked in all of the previous films. A large credit to Steve Kloves who wrote a perfect screenplay to J.K. Rowling's novel. Kloves followed the novel's original creativity while adding his own creativity to the bundle of brilliance. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint are at their best in this final installment. Their performance perfectly depicts J.K. Rowling's original portrayal of Harry, Hermione, and Ron. It's been obvious that a performance like this had been progressing within these three actors ever since 2001 and I'm so glad that it finally came out in the conclusion of Harry Potter, a story about a boy and his scar that will forever live in the hearts of those millions of fans who witnessed a phenomenal story about love, bravery, and the importance of friendship.",

David Yates proved himself, once again, as the best adapter of the Harry Potter series into film, even more so than Alfonso Cuaron, who was rather good at it, too. What surprised me a lot was the emotional impact that the film had on me. Many of the scenes had quite convincing settings and emotional depth that is unprecedented in the Potter series. The storytelling was rather slick and the visuals are simply stunning. The special effects have by far been one of the best, with the exception of the Half-Blood Prince possibly. Overall, the finale of the series was done as good as it could have been done. I'm rather happy that they decided to split the last book into two films, since it allowed for a fuller, more complex understanding and presentation of the story in the film. It is by far the best of the Harry Potter films and it is a worthy and spectacular ending for a series that has helped shape a whole generation.",

Everyone who hasn't seen the movie yet still awaits an awe-inspiring finale, in three dimensions even. It's hard to imagine the sheer magnitude that the series has been. 8 movies that all feature a place in the top 25 most succesfull movies. 7 books that have only been outsold by The Holy Bible. Theme parks. Billions of toys, games, candy, action figures, playing cards, all devoured by an army of fans big enough to occupy a continent or two.

But after the fact, I couldn't be happier with their decision. Rather than making one movie approximately 2.5 hours long with skimpy details and a rushed plot line, they decided to split it up, keeping the slower and more somber first half with all the necessary plot points for a cinematic interpretation. The same goes for the fast and furious second part. //Minor spoilersPart 2 of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows starts off where the Part 1 finished, Harry and company had just escaped the Malfoy Manor with a murdered Dobby the house elf. With 3 horcruxes destroyed, they set out to find and destroy the last 4.  Although there are parts that are slightly altered/ omitted, the movie keeps all the important plot points from the books and acknowledges that the omitted parts exist. The nonstop fighting of the battle at Hogwarts is a perfect fit for cinematography. Literally every hero/character that had been introduced in previous films (and still living) come back to have a small portion of the movie to have the spotlight. All the story lines are shown including the bank robbery, the horcrux searches, Dumbledore's ancestry explained, Snape's ties to Harry, and even Neville's becoming of a hero in his own right. It does a fantastic job of showing everything that everyone wanted out of the books in the movie.Final word:This is a fantastic finish to the phenomenal Harry Potter franchise.

While somehow maintaining the feel of the other films, Deathly Hallows 2 separates itself by knowing that it's the end and therefore bringing with it more emotion, conflict, and symbolism than the others.  Harry's willingness to give his life makes him not foolish for being the hero for once, but rather his maturity is shown to have grown where he can accept circumstance and face it, though with obvious hesitation.  I must say that I particularly enjoyed the way that Snape was performed, since we finally got to see into his past with acting that couldn't have been more perfect.

Soaring far beyond expectations, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 was a home run hit. Possibly the best part was the perfect ending to the movie, as well as the series. It is my guess that no other series will ever match the \"grabbing\" effect Harry Potter had - not soon at least. Through ten long years the audience was introduced to Harry and his gang, toured the great Hogwarts facility, and studied the world of magic from the most noble of wizards and witches - all while being kept on the edges of their seats by thrilling action scenes. After so long of watching the gang's adventures one might have felt a desire to visit the magical school themselves, but the routine journeys to Hogwarts are finally over with Voldemort defeated and our favorite friends settling into the long-awaited couples. While the story has come to conclusion, the imagination has not. Hogwarts was a fun and desirable academy to dream about, so next time you find yourself looking for a great date idea, something to do with the guys, or just a good movie, pop in one of 8 Harry Potter discs and mash the play button!

The Potter finale is not bad, by any means. Nor am I concerned that it takes liberties with the books. The problem is that, as a rousing finale, it is lacking, chiefly because the pace is all wrong. We've been set up for 11 years for the momentum that must carry this film, and it's all stops and starts.  Not good. Then, and also irrespective of Rowling's story, I was deeply disturbed by Voldemort's weak agenda. Haven't we been led to anticipate that, in full power, he is going to consume the world? So - why is he so triumphant at the Hogwarts scene, as though the school were his ultimate goal? The Voldemort I've been expecting would not bother making a recruitment speech to the kids. They join or die, period, and he's too flimsy here to be truly scary. On the plus side: Rickman is fabulous. Radcliffe is better than he ever was. AT LAST, Maggie Smith gets to strut her stuff.  That makes it worth it. But...this was not a truly successful film conclusion to the saga.  And, to be rather **** I so wanted a bit more oomph when Mrs. Weasley takes out Bellatrix. PS All the reviews indicate lots of casualties from adult and young characters. Hmm. A few, none terribly shocking.",

The imaginative worlds of the moviesRegarding the relationship between the books and movies:  Novel \"purists\" should stop pretending the relationship is or should be one-sided, in which movies serve as visual allegiances to Rowling's words.  The imaginative worlds of the movies and books are both distinct and mutually influential.  It seems clear that Rowling started writing with a movie consciousness (altering her themes and action in preparation for the big screen) in Goblet of Fire, or at least Order of the Phoenix.  So not only do the movies deserve their own agency, they push back on Rowling and shape the novels.About the movie:  It's at once a celebration of the first seven films and their fireworks grand finale.  Have fun recognizing all the homages.  Note the score, which incorporates themes from much of John Williams' original visions, as well as mood pieces from Yates' earlier contributions. Although some character cameos from the previous films are obvious, others take a bit of crowd analysis.  Also check the room of requirement for a few trips down memory lane.  The movie is a time capsule of the films' collective culture.But it's also a fluid and marvelous piece of entertainment on its own (as like 200 professional critics have noted with enough words).  Is it perfect?  Well, it has Ginny Weasley.  But Neville Longbottom's geek awesomeness more than baptizes those moments.  If you enjoy the idea of Neville Longbottom being awesome, you'll fall for the movie as naturally as Luna falls for--all assortment of geeky things.",

As it happens, this last offering was the most disappointing.

The overwhelmingly positive reviews baffle me. The acting wasn't all that bad,  don't get me wrong, but the problem at the end of the day  was that in the rush to get through the vast plot, we barely got to see the best of any of these talented young actors. There was a distinct lack of speech from any of the characters, and although seven films had preceded it, I did not feel that there was even a tenth of the character development that had made the book so enlightening.
