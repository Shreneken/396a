    "Incendies is no one’s idea of a joyful ride, but it’s a remarkable work, and its complex story etches itself on the memory.",
    "Incendies is a gallery of nightly news atrocities - a bus massacre, rape, children with guns - yet it's made intensely personal under the director's steady hand.",
    "It knocks you off your feet and leaves you shaken.",
    "Incendies is no mere riff on a Greek mainstay. It is its own entity, delicate and fierce. Already I've risked making it sound like homework. It's not; it's an enthralling drama of survival.",
    "The storytelling in Incendies strikes me as primal the way Greek tragedy is primal. Shattering. Cathartic. It is a breathtaking film.",
    "Denis Villeneuve's screen adaptation of a play by the Lebanese-Canadian playwright Wajdi Mouawad tells a story-masterfully-of courage, cruelty, family mysteries and a chain of anger that can only be broken by love.",
    "A staggering political drama that could put you in mind of the intimate sweep of Bernardo Bertolucci, Incendies feels like a mighty movie in our midst.",
    "The movie is a bumpy road of twists that leads to a revelation that has the shock and force of Greek tragedy.",
    "Villeneuve's telling of her story - and of her children's - is painful, searing and something close to brilliant.",
    "The movie doesn't quite jell, but you'll feel its sting for hours.",
    "Although the film runs more than two hours, the story is so compelling and the production so beautifully controlled that we are gripped by the characters' quest right up to the shocking end of the story.",
    "A story of hope amid the ruins -- one that everybody can appreciate, no matter their politics.",
    "Reverberates with the power and passion of Greek tragedy.",
    "The movie, engrossing as it is intentionally horrifying, is capped by a last-minute revelation that brings the story to a haunting, powerful close.",
    "A mystery, a melodrama, a prison film, and a love story, Incendies is foremost a scream of rage at a society destroyed by religion and by men.",
    "Most people do not choose their religions but have them forced upon themselves by birth, and the lesson of Incendies is that an accident of birth is not a reason for hatred.",
    "A devastating mystery thriller from Quebec filmmaker Denis Villeneuve that grabs you hard and won't let go.",
    "The climax is a little too clever and far-fetched-an unnecessarily neat finale for a movie that works fine when dealing in broad strokes, some of which are nothing short of masterful.",
    "Expertly shifting between present and past , writer-director Denis Villeneuve displays an impressive command of his material, patiently building up to an emotionally explosive climax.",
    "A thriller that twists and turns with an understated power that will have you gripping the arm of your seat. Terrific stuff.",
    "By the end theyve acquired a measure of self-knowledge at a cost dearer than they expected, which reminds us that what we think we know can be just the beginning of an existential journey.",
    "Filled with striking images and the ghosts of lives lived in hardship and war, Incendies is tough but impactful.",
    "Mr. Villeneuve tells Nawal's story in a way that is both subtle and emphatic, and Ms. Azabal, portraying Nawal from hopeful youth to despairing middle age, gives a performance that is all the more powerful for the restrained, unshakeable sense of dignity she brings to it.",
    "Azabal is superb, conveying Nawal's fiery presence, determination and mounting bitterness. The impressive cast includes non-professionals from Jordan, where Incendies was filmed.",
    "Incendies vaults Denis Villeneuve to the status of serious director.",
    "It would be difficult not to be swept away by the dramatic intensity of Incendies.",
    "With Incendies, Villeneuve attempts to balance moment-by-moment authenticity and operatic emotional impact. Much of the time, he succeeds.",
    "A deeply resonant literary quality gives what might otherwise seem like a dubious series of coincidences a profound sense of plausibility.",
    "The story might have worked as well without that stick-in-the-craw coincidence, which was inserted to maximize the horrors of Nawal's past.",
    "Incendies is occasionally compelling, but also overlong and vexing in the ways it draws out a \"shocking\" conclusion that we unravel long before the characters do.",
    "The film's moral lesson – that violence begets violence – isn't exactly a showstopper, and the balm that is laid on Nawal and her riven family can't quite compensate for the poison that preceded it.",
    "The past is where all the intrigue of the movie lies, and that is where the film is at its most compelling, with the present sometimes wilting in the desert heat.",
    "Incendies was likely a crackling thing to read, but it's not quite so vivid as a finished film.",
    "While the film will likely stick with viewers, it's ultimately a tossup what they'll remember most: the stunning buildup, or the massive letdown.",
    "An enormously effective piece of filmmaking, Incdendies unfolds as a series of eye-opening disclosures which Villeneuve plays as much for (admittedly enthralling) sensation as for any kind of wider-ranging inquiry, a questionable approach given the thorny nature of the material.",
    "Canadian director Denis Villaneuve knows how to stoke a hot debate about the legacy of violence. But in this case, where there's smoke, there's not enough air.",
    "While the characters lack credibility, the social backdrop and texture of the performances certainly don’t, and Villeneuve manages to say more about the sorry state of the Middle East (Lebanon is suggested but never mentioned) through the bold, crisp way he shoots faces, buildings and parched, beige-brown landscapes. So let’s call it’s a strong film based on a weak story.",
    "It's an intriguing movie, in some ways, but its contrived and even bizarre final revelation depends on coincidences of almost Hardyesque proportions. It is not really believable, and yet if it is not taken literally, but as a cinematic prose-poem, it has undoubted force.",
    "The film, directed by Denis Villeneuve, delves into the moral fiber and traumatic tree rings of war more than most films have or most likely ever will, but without one clear vantage point or emotional anchor.",
    "Skillfully made and offering moments of great power, the French Canadian drama Incendies nevertheless overplays its hand, piling tragedy on tragedy until we feel browbeaten with misery.",
    "A kind name for this attitude is false moral equivalence, or perhaps post-imperial cringe. A less kind one is Western self-hatred, or an urgent plea to tolerate the intolerant.",
    "Nawal's travails are more in the vein of a Latin American soap opera than Greek tragedy, and Jeanne and Simon's climactic, genuinely god-awful discovery plays like artistic sleight-of-hand rather than the profoundly tautological revelation it aspires to be."

If his film ticks for more than two hours, heCold As A Viscous Flame.IncendiesVilleneuve is a gentleman when it comes to respect the genre he plays in. In fact, he respects the whole system, even the hefty hectic part of the film. If his film ticks for more than two hours, he definitely has edited at least half an hour from it. He isn't ashamed, afraid or lazy on going deep in to the tunnels and get his hands dirty. He foliates the darker side of the human as a compelling arc for the storytelling. Take the imprisoned part of Nawal's (Lubna Azabal) life, even something so informative and dry part of the script as such, Denis Villeneuve, the director, has crafted out a nail biting drama where the emotion is installed in it by introducing a song in it.Now, this song isn't something he just throws out randomly, he first teases us by formulating a title to that very act as \"The Woman Who Sings\", so incredible is that name, that every time it is referenced for advancing the storyline, there is a pathos in its vocab that he armors in for this long, long battle. There are plenty of scenarios in the film and often the filmmaker loses the tone of the film and there is an uneven pace that itches the viewers, but Villeneuve's experience is mostly the saviour of it.While the rest of it, is left upon the actors like Lubna and Melissa, where despite of going back and forth in timeline there is an equal force resisting the dogmatic postulates of the world. There is a poetic bridge connecting these parallel worlds and the answer is the performance so magnificent that it deconstructs all the semantics of the script. Incendies is the fire that will not spark the charge but will burn the whole forest down unapologetically.",

I do think the film could have had a prologue explaining the political situation in which we the viewer were about to be injected.  One of the things I admire about foreign films is they are less likely to glamorize or gloss over the brutality that exists. I went and looked up the history of the conflict and found it to be as complicated as this film portrayed. The scenes that really struck me were he cold blooded killing of the little child on the bus and the sniper killings in Beirut.

Telling the story of Jeanne (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin) and Simon Marwan (Maxim Gaudette) on their journey to find their father and brother in the aftermath of the death of their mother, Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal). A thoroughly heartwrenching journey through a religiously and war torn Middle Eastern nation that is part self-discovery and part war story, Incendies feels influenced by classic Greek and Shakespearean tragedies (namely one that I will mention later on since it is a major spoiler) and also feels incredibly important for today. Yet, Incendies' greatest power is its emotional impact and the way in which it leaves you absolutely stunned at what you just witnessed.\r An incredibly crafted mystery film from director Denis Villeneuve, the ending of Incendies is not one you see coming. In fact, when the reveal occurs, you are left stunned as it is most certainly not what was anticipated. Rather, through shocking twists and turns throughout its story, Incendies is a haunting story of civil war in an unnamed Middle Eastern nation. Telling the story of Christian nationalists who reject refugees against Muslims who accept the refugees, the film breaks your heart from the very first shot of Nawal's involvement in this classic tale. Given the political goings on in the United States today, it is not hard to draw comparisons between Incendies and current events. The fact that Nawal is a Christian who loves a refugee makes this film almost have a Romeo & Juliet feel to it in the very beginning, except this time Romeo actually dies and Juliet brings shame on her entire family, almost being killed as a result. The rest, when told from the perspective of Nawal, details her journey to find the son she and her now deceased lover had together. This journey brings her face-to-face with the Christian nationalists before she winds up in political prison. Nawal's journey is particularly harrowing and incredibly well told. As a character, her motivation is clear: to find her son. The path she takes is solely towards that goal, in spite of her being caught up in the civil war.\r Yet, the greatest influence on the story of Incendies has to be Oedipus. Mirroring the tale as Nawal is forced to give up her son, Nihad (Abdelghafour Elaaziz), for adoption, only to wind up being raped and impregnated by him in prison (unbeknownst to both of them at the time), Incendies gives the viewer the same sickening feeling as Oedipus does. Yet, it takes Oedipus one step further by having their children find out the truth as well. The reactions of the characters is just painful and thoroughly messed up to watch  unfold. Though it lacks the free-will and Oracle elements of Oedipus, it does feel as thought the film's story does bear marks of influence.\r In terms of Incendies itself, it is incredibly well shot to go along with its tremendous emotional power. There is one shot in particular of Nawal crying beside a burning bus she was once on. After Christian nationalists slaughtered everyone on the bus for being Muslims, but sparing Nawal as she is a Christian, the bus burns in the background. The spiraling black smoke and orange flames are gorgeously captured alongside Nawal's pain-filled cries.\r Before the ending is revealed, the mystery is thoroughly well-developed. Always leaving you on edge as Jeanne and Simon discover more-and-more about their mother's previously unknown past, the film really spins a terrific yarn and brings you throughout the region. In the process, it not only explores this deeply destroyed family, but also explores this deeply destroyed region. With many Middle Eastern countries going through this process, the emotional impact of seeing this nation blown to bits is incredible. Upon revealing the mystery, the final letters left by Nawal for Jeanne and Simon, as well as the two for Nihad are absolutely heartwrenching. Filled with emotion, forgiveness, and power, the film reveals its true heart here as it is not just a story about a mother searching for her son, but also a story of forgiving that son for all the pain and suffering he had caused her. Truly powerful in this regard, Incendies leaves an indelible mark on all who view it for this very reason.\r The only foreign-language film from Villeneuve that I have seen, Incendies reveals that I have far more to watch. Having seen all of his English-language works and eagerly anticipating Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, Villeneuve has to be one of the best filmmakers working currently.",

I now know that it is based on a play by Wajdi Mouawad. Mouawad is a Canadien writer, and to my delight, Incendies is part of a series of four plays. This means I have three more Incendies-like plays still to read.\r I won’t go through a run-down of the plot, talk in abstractions about arch, characters symbiosis or lack-there-of…. there are tons of proper film reviews out there already dealing with these topics. I thought I’d just talk about two things, the two things that I thought make this an outstanding film: Photography, and the remarkable unfolding of a dramatic story; better film critics than me, which is to say any real film critic, have said that this film pulls off tragedy better than the Greeks.\rThe photography… was just as good the second time as it was the first time I saw it. The film opens in a village that could be mistaken for Greece of Israel. At thought maybe this was set and shot in Palestine, but I think most of the film as actually shot in Jordan. Theses shots are actually set to portray a fictional Lebanon, both past and modern day. The history intertwined with the movie seems to be loosely fictional; I can’t find any information on any of the places that appear in film. My Lebanese civil war history is a little rusty. Anyone else?\r There are two shots in particular that stand out. Both are shot at a distance to reveal the vastness of the landscape, unmistakably Mediterranean. Rocky, and the trees, not that I’m a tree expert, but they must be olive or fig trees, they are almost overused as prototypical symbols of the Med, but they work great.\rThe first shot I like is actually two shots, meaning one type of shot that is used twice, almost identically. It’s of a bus traveling on a skinny, mountainside road. At first, the camera is in close then pans way out to show the whole panoramic view, massive landscape, and tiny bus,  a common technique in World films that are shot in exotic landscapes. The other shot is similar. It is later in the film. One of the characters is driving to a modern day Deressa Refugee camp and there is a shot taken from the sky of the winding roads leading up the side of a mountain. This shot is amazing, and whatever effects of filters the photographer added to make it fit the film’s tone so well, I can’t think of a better word to use to describe them, and the shot as ‘cinematic.’ I know that’s a terrible term to use when describing Cinema, I really do, but a shot like this is so expressive and well-placed in the film, there is nothing going in the film here excepts visuals, the shot on it’s own stands out as an artistic, filmmaking achievement.\rThe storyline…unfolds with the precision of a textbook tragedy. It sets up the conflict right off the top--- find missing brother and father. As the drama unfolds the story becomes more and more complex, adding twists and turns to the plot that we never even thought possible. In the end we are left with remains that challenge Oedipus the King in magnitude of ruination, yet still manage to exit the scene with a sparkle of hope. Forgiveness lets the audience breath a little easier as the film closes, a catharsis, but even then the story, the film, will haunt your subconscious for a good while after.",

TalkingAn okay movie, but extremely overrated by critics.The story is basically a two-hour intellectual torture porn, piling tragedy upon tragedy so inflationarily that after one hour, I lost all emotional connection to the protagonist. Talking about protagonists, the three main characters lack depth and development and feel like they are just there to enable the (admittedly rather skillful) telling of the plot. As has been criticised by a lot of other reviewers, the plot twists become more and more contrived to the point of absurdity - which is not a big problem if you accept the movie as an illustration about the effect that war has on the fate of the individual. What's a lot more unfortunate is that exactly this illustration is ill-executed because we get so little insight into the world of the characters. The movie doesn't make a firm commitment to telling either the story of a society torn by war or that of individuals broken by war and, as a result, fails at convincingly telling either of the two.I guess the good reviews are a result of the many - and not very elaborate - references the story makes to topics which are usually well-received by critics, regardless of the quality in which they are presented: cultural oppression of women, sexual violence, child soldiers, perversion of religion for the purpose of war, etc.On a more positive note, it has some very well-crafted and intense scenes and well-picked scenery.In the end, neither Incendies' plot nor its message warrant sitting through two hours of headshots, bombs, rape, child murder, torture and screaming women, so I wouldn't recommend it.",

It has some plot twists and it felt quite powerful as the meaning of things became clear towards the end. Its a bit of a tough watch and it won't appeal to everyone but its a reasonably good film overall. I wouldn't especially recommend it as such because its so bleak.",

This film yet talks about families being separated in parts of tragedies long lost in time for how mothers can be able to see their children again for another time when they are long gone, imprisoned, or dead but there's more to this film I wanted to see in the end. To be real Denis Villeneuve's screen adaptation of a play by the Lebanese Canadian playwright Wajdi Mouawad tells a story-masterfully-of courage, cruelty, family mysteries and a chain of anger that can only be broken by love. To me I say this film was far too amazing.",
