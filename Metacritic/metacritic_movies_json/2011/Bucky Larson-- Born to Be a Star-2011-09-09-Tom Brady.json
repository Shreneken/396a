  "title": "Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star",
  "rating": 1.9,
  "release_date": "2011-09-09",
  "genre": [
    "Comedy"
  ],
  "summary": "Bucky is a small town grocery bagger, going nowhere in life – until he discovers that his conservative parents were once adult film stars!  Armed with the belief that he has found his destiny, Bucky packs up and heads out to LA, hoping to follow in his parents’ footsteps.(Columbia Pictures)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "That Bucky Larson's humor is stuck at a toilet-centric grade school level is less damning than how little of that or any humor it contains - the film, directed by Tom Brady (The Hot Chick), sets up scene after scene that wanders around in the general vicinity of a joke idea without ever approaching anything like a punchline.",
    "Never thought we'd say this about a movie, but Bucky Larson probably doesn't wring as much out of recurring bodily-fluid gags as it could.",
    "It's an ugly movie to look at and a faintly nauseating one to sit through, truth be told.",
    "Bucky Larson is a one-note joke played over and over and over.",
    "This movie is dire, soul-crushing stuff.",
    "Of course, Bucky Larson isn't one of the year's worst films because its laughs are poisoned and problematic - rather, it's one of the year's worst films because there aren't any laughs at all.",
    "The scenario makes for an inept, lazy R-rated movie whose sole purpose is as a glossary of euphemisms for genitalia and sexual acts.",
    "Apparently no one told Ricci she was acting in a comedy, not a touching drama about a young woman overcoming a formative trauma to achieve her dreams.",
    "One of the most astonishingly unfunny films of this or any other year.",
    "This god-awful, unfunny, stinkingly putrid sketch-comic movie has exactly one snicker-worthy moment, involving Kevin Nealon and a stolen grape. But watching the rest of it will make you whine.",
    "This may be the worst movie Pauly Shore has ever been in. Think about that.",
    "Unfortunately, the R rating will prohibit the target audience -- namely teenage boys who find penis jokes endlessly hilarious - from seeing this relentlessly unfunny and vulgar effort until it shows up on video and cable.",
    "What does startle is how tiresome it all is."

I'm not about to tell you that this is a good movie. It isn't. It's awful as far as movies go, but if stupidly offensive material is what makes you laugh in a morbid so wrong its funny kind of way, then this is the kind of movie you could sit through once and enjoy. As a side note, I think it's kind of weird that the dude they have in the trailers (-five of him on screen at once- \"RATED Awrrrr!\") is in only one scene in the entire movie. Something tells me this movie was originally going to be longer cause there are a lot of plot holes. One of the big ones, if I'm not mistaken and just wasn't paying attention, is that suddenly right after being told that Bucky's porn movies would never be successful, they somehow go into production anyway. Like it literally jumps from the scene where all the potential investors decline being any part of it as they laugh their way out of the room right to the movies being an instant success. Whatever, I put way more thought into this than was ever necessary. It's a dumb movie, but if you like stupid comedies rent it. It's not really worth going to a theater to see.",

He truly sold the greasiness of his character, and his eyes bored through each line with drill-like charisma, at least until the rushed-climax/resolution.  Dorff somewhat dialed it in, but was passable as the antago-douche.  Ricci didn't have too much to work with, the way it was scripted, but she definitely played it cute enough to get by.  Nealon was an unexpected hoot.  Mosseri was pretty funny for a background.  Sandler's standard roster of players could definitely have used waaaaaay much more screen time.  The casting of the hotties was done well, and there were a few shots that were cinematographically attractive, to my surprise.  Swardson immersed himself in a role which had to have been tough to sell, so he did what he could.  Raunchily bad overall?  Yes.  On-purpose?  Totally.  Take this movie for what it is.  I mean, look at the premise... what do you expect, Godfather?  A few giggles here and there, some writing holes, but eh.  The music selections and score were pretty good though, surprisingly enough.  I'll watch it again next time I'm sh!t-faced drunk with my friends and want to have some stupid guilt-free laughs.  I mean, what did you think you were going in here to see, the Godfather for chrissakes?
