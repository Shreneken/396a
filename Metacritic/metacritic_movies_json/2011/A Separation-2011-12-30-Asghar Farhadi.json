  "critic_reviews": [
    "It's a mystery wrapped inside an enigmatic nation, flawlessly acted and difficult to predict. I'm always impressed when a movie informs about a foreign culture while it entertains, and this one is powerful art in that regard.",
    "The story winds its way over the material, forcing the characters and the viewers to constantly reassess everything they have seen and heard.",
    "The movie has such a profound and compassionate understanding of human behavior, family ties and the way ordinary people respond when they're forced into a moral quandary, I can't imagine anyone not being transfixed by it.",
    "A great movie, a look inside a world so foreign that it might as well be another planet, yet so universal that its observations are painfully familiar to anyone, anywhere.",
    "This is a trenchant emotional thriller that you watch in dread, awe, and amazing aggravation. It's entirely predicated upon the outcome of bad decisions - and it is not a comedy. The situation that unfolds approaches the absurdity of farce but denies the relief and release of humor. It's a tragic farce. No option or choice is to be envied.",
    "The movie is hugely compelling on a moral and emotional level - I was completely hooked - yet it also revealed to me in numerous small and concrete ways what it's like to live in a contemporary theocracy.",
    "The film is a singular achievement, a piece of realist cinema with the pull of a suspense thriller.",
    "The actors, as sometimes happens, create those miracles that can endow a film with conviction. Moadi and Hatami, as husband and wife, succeed in convincing us their characters are acting from genuine motives.",
    "Moaadi is the standout here, subtly evoking filial worry and fatherly pride in one scene, popping off with rage in another: He's believably decent, believably flawed. A Separation touches on religious strictures and the role of women in Iran, but it does so with a light hand and not a twitch of condemnation.",
    "Farhadi is no mere formalist. His film is a spiritual investigation into the rise of women and the descent of male privilege in Iran, and a look at the toll that has taken. In a movie of flawless acting, it is Moadi - terse, proud, angry, haunted - who shows us that rare thing: a soul in transition.",
    "Asghar Farhadi's A Separation serves as a quiet reminder of how good it's possible for movies to be.",
    "However ripe A Separation might seem for being adapted into a smart American film, Hollywood shouldn't bother. Farhadi's movie is just about perfect as it is.",
    "Something close to a contemporary masterwork, and maybe the best foreign-language film of the year, right at the tail end.",
    "A Separation is not the work of a constrained artist. It's a great movie in which the full range of human interaction seems to play itself out before our eyes.",
    "A film that captures the drama and suspense of real life as urgently as any picture released this year.",
    "A Separation is totally foreign and achingly familiar. It's a thrilling domestic drama that offers acute insights into human motivations and behavior as well as a compelling look at what goes on behind a particular curtain that almost never gets raised.",
    "The members of the cast represent ensemble, naturalistic acting at its finest.",
    "Sophisticated and universal yet deeply intimate, A Separation is an exquisitely conceived family drama that has the coiled power of a top-notch thriller.",
    "Beyond the impeccable performances and direction, it's foremost an exceptional piece of screenwriting, so finely wrought that the drama seems guided by an invisible hand.",
    "It's a frantic microcosm of life itself.",
    "The drama it might remind you most of, oddly enough, is \"Six Degrees of Separation,\" also about the snowballing connections between unlikely people. And as in that urban clash, the bedrock of it all is social responsibility, ever crumbling and rebuilding. A total triumph.",
    "It happens to be splendidly acted and to be poised, as a narrative, on a knife's edge (the final shot, at a great moment of indecision, is utterly haunting).  But, chiefly, it's a portrait of an essential and sympathetic human dilemma, and in that it's both real and timeless in ways that transcend borders, cultures and languages.",
    "What makes it so good is that no one is bad. These humans, desperate to do right, are caught up in a perfect storm of inhumanity. The evil is in the ecosystem.",
    "As in all the director's work, the cast is given top consideration and their realistic acting results in unusual depth of characterization.",
    "Tense and narratively complex, formally dense and morally challenging.",
    "The writer and director, Asghar Farhadi, has thus created the perfect antithesis of a crunching disaster flick, such as \"2012,\" which was all boom and no ripple.",
    "Every time it starts to feel like something we have known, we realize how unlike us these Iranian characters are.",
    "Although it's slow to unfold, this courtroom drama is so timelessly humane and even-handed it feels like it came from the dockets of Solomon - by way of Sidney Lumet.",
    "It's small. It's real. And it's deeply moving.",
    "It is a mystery and a courtroom drama. Above all, however, it is a tale of love and sacrifice.",
    "Much like Robert Altman during his forays into the genre, writer/director Asghar Farhadi isn't really interested in the answers. Instead, he keeps expanding the questions, until that singular title comes to seem a misnomer.",
    "A Separation is a landmark film. No way will you be able to get it out of your head.",
    "Barriers both transparent and persistently present encase the characters of A Separation, constricting them in ways social, cultural, religious, familial, and emotional.",
    "A Separation doesn't try to make easy sense of that world, or of this family's suffering. It's simply a quiet cry of anguish.",
    "It's the little moments in Farhadi's film that are its most important, speaking every bit as loudly as its big, narrative-driving moments.",
    "Meticulously thoughtful and economical in its execution, from its camerawork to its editing, Farhadi's carefully wrought narrative and the ways it handles the fragile emotions of its characters truly sets it apart, not only from contemporary Iranian cinema but world cinema in general.",
    "Powerful art cinema that challenges political and social unity in Iran.",
    "It is a rigorously honest movie about the difficulties of being honest, a film that tries to be truthful about the slipperiness of truth.",
    "Together and apart, Hatami and Maadi are magnetic. Hatami, a star in Iranian cinema, lets us see Simin's intelligence and defiant sense of self-worth often with nothing more than a gesture.",
    "What's fascinating is how the various issues - religious or practical - are played out in these two quite different families, yet always come down to irreconcilable differences between rebellious women and their stiff-necked, controlling men.",
    "In the compelling but slow-moving Iranian film A Separation, a downbeat family drama of no particular distinction gradually turns into a mystery that raises painful moral questions. There may be several guilty parties."

The drifting apart of a married couple and their daughter, as tensions build up and small lies spin out of control. Everyone has good reasons for what they do and their own truth which looks like lies and distortions to others. This does not add up to a harmonious life. That it all this place in contemporary Iran with its strictures and deprivations only adds to the drama as social classes and degrees of religious observance collide and clash. The characters are flawlessly acted and their imperfections completely authentic. The camera work is brilliant with frequent closeups of actors who seem completely real. There is no preaching or taking sides, the film is humanistic in its sympathy for all  the characters even when they transgress. This is movie-making at its best, reminiscent of the films that came from central and eastern Europe during the communist era and its immediate aftermath.",

Only the children see the reality and offer some hope. The little girl plays with the oxygen levels.The choice of Termeh in the final scene is the choice the youth in Iran stands for:leave the country or stay and revolt, again.Shirin Yazdi",

The acting is uniformly excellent - it presents such interesting windows into the lives of each character. The glimpse into the Iranian legal system is incredibly interesting. What I initially considered to be organized chaos actually started to make some sense by the end, as I loosed up on my western notions of how these disputes should be resolved.  It puts an incredible amount of power into a single magistrate's hands, but it sure does cut down on the red tape!  Though trusting the suspect in a murder case not to talk to a key witness as he summons her from the hallway of the courtroom seemed a bridge too far.  Then again, the judge seemed to know how to deal with the possibility of corruption in that process.  The notion of honor, as reflected in honesty - from citizen to society, and from father to daughter - transcends the legal process. At least in this case, among this group of peole. I would have liked to have known a bit more about the mother's motivation to leave the country, but it's not something that detracted from the film. This is an easy recommendation.",

The story is not only about men and women, children and parents, justice and religion in today's Iran, but that raises complex and globally relevant questions of responsibility, of the subjectivity and contingency of 'TELLING THE TRUTH', and of how thin the line can be between inflexibility and pride  especially of the male variety  and selfishness and tyranny.

I was fooled into believing this would be a dull, family drama, but 'A Separation\" is extremely engaging. Its serious, intelligent and simply a very satisfying viewing experience. The deterioration of a marriage and ripple effects it has on the family and individuals outside the family is wonderfully evoked through assured film making and a string of wonderful performances from the foreign cast. The movie flows and unfolds with good timing and closes with one of the finest conclusions of the year. This is simply a very good movie.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nAmazing. At the film's core lies the conflict between Nader and Simin, a married couple seeking a separation. Simin wants to leave Iran for a better life abroad, while Nader wants to stay and care for his Alzheimers-ridden father. Caught in the middle of their bickering is their daughter, Termeh. In many ways, the core struggle is symbolic of the struggle many Iranians feel every day. Should they stay and fight to protect the country they love or leave when times get tough? Termeh's decision to live with one parent or another can be interpreted as a judgement on the director's end, regarding which parent is most justified. No such judgement is made. Many other deep moral dilemas are presented to the audience, who are then left to make up their own minds about each character's rightness or wrongness. The movie is beautifully acted, every performance feels organic and real, although that might just be the language and cultural barrier playing tricks on my judgement. At the end of the day, you really could do worse than this movie. It's one of those films that resonates in your brain days after you see it.",

The drifting apart of a married couple and their daughter, as tensions build up and small lies spin out of control. Everyone has good reasons for what they do and their own truth which looks like lies and distortions to others. This does not add up to a harmonious life. That it all this place in contemporary Iran with its strictures and deprivations only adds to the drama as social classes and degrees of religious observance collide and clash. The characters are flawlessly acted and their imperfections completely authentic. The camera work is brilliant with frequent closeups of actors who seem completely real. There is no preaching or taking sides, the film is humanistic in its sympathy for all the characters even when they transgress. This is movie-making at its best, reminiscent of the films that came from central and eastern Europe during the communist era and its immediate aftermath",

The dialogue is smart and ambiguous. The shot is framed so that all your attention is focused on the two characters, you are hanging on every word. Invested in what emotion they are conveying and thus invested in them as characters right from the beginning. So it goes with A Separation a dialogue, character driven Iranian film that will have you invested throughout.\r The driving force behind this film is conflict. Nearly every character that comes in contact with each other has some sort of conflict at some point. How they react to the conflict engages us and drives the narrative forward. A Separation also makes nearly every character both sympathetic and unsympathetic at the same time. At any given time we are mostly unaware of who is lying and whether their motives are pure.\r As an American viewer I was also quite intrigued at some of the cultural conflict in this film. There is a married couple who are devout Muslims and this informs many of the decisions they make throughout the film. Their conflict as a result of their beliefs is not something that most of us can relate to. Even the religious devout in our culture would not allow these things to become a point of contention. For an outsider this definitely added to my intrigue within the film.\r A Separation is a well made intriguing drama. The writing is superb. The acting is very good, especially Maadi. While the visuals are not particularly note worthy, the scenes are framed very well, in a way that engages the viewer. A Separation is a must view for any film lover.",

Americans are not often treated to such subtle portrayals of the region- in fact, this is the first Iranian film I (and probably many others) have ever seen. For that, I am glad to have seen A Separation. Accurate representations of other cultures are always fascinating. And yet, I did not enjoy this movie. Almost everything about it- the acting, the direction, the editing, the dialogue- was superb. Technically, it is a masterpiece; a tightly wound, densely layered film made with a degree of finesse rivaling the best efforts of Hollywood's elite. And for all that, it fails, as do most films of the cinema verite style of filmmaking, for one simple reason: nothing good happens. It starts bad and goes downhill from there. There is nary a single ray of hope, optimism, or humor to lighten the relentlessly grim, depressing atmosphere that pervades A Separation from beginning to end. By the halfway point, it is apparent the film has been written in such a way so as to prevent a happy ending. The characters have gotten themselves so entrenched in their problems that redemption is out of the question. I am of the belief that the \"life sucks\" attitude so common in modern filmmaking is merely an excuse for lazy storytelling. It is easy to make things hard on your characters. It is even easier to make them harder. To resolve these issues in a believable and compelling manner- and to avoid sentimentality and predictability in the process- is a real challenge, and one that that many filmmakers, unfortunately, choose to avoid altogether. The consequence of this artistic lethargy is a hopeless, unresolved feeling in the viewer's gut that persists for hours, days even, after the credits roll. That is not why I- and many, many others- go to the movies. If I want to feel like crap, I'll read the news, thank you very much.",

Even the title is misleading, because only the first and last scene have something to do with the actual separation. We see Simin (the wife) and Nader (the husband) in front of a judge debating the reasons why they want to split. Actually, Simin wants to split, Nader seems not to care one way or the other – which certainly does not give much motivation to continue a marriage.\r I am sure such a story based in Europe or the US would not have won an Oscar, but it is not the first time – nor will be the last – that a movie wins a prize for obscure reasons that have nothing to do with cinematography.",

That is great as we usually get bullets and bombs and superheros. However, the movie is boring and painful to sit through. I could not watch it twice if you paid me. I was glad to see that Islam is as negative a force as other religions and I was glad to see that Iran is backwards. However, I already knew that and this story did not have enough drama to keep my interest. Sorry but it may have needed a bomb or explosion in it.",

If you read on, please do these thought experiments: imagine you only can experience The King's Speech with its central character a stuttering future king being presented with sub-titles. Or the film Shakespeare in Love with its poetic language exhibited in situation where non-English sub-titles are needed. Please refer me to any critic who commented on any aspect of the quality of A Separation's sub-titles from the font selection to the fidelity to the nuances of the dialogue. Sub-titles are a huge filter to appreciating or even understanding a movie. Isn't it a form being aesthetically correct or having intellectual pretensions to ignore the fact you do not understand the language of the dialogue? RANT OVER. I did like the movie for depicting Iranians neither as death-to-America chanters nor green displaying social networking revolutionaries, but as middle class or poor people who were struggling with family health or financial problems.",

On the positive side, it did provide an interesting window into contemporary Iranian life. It did present some very challenging dilemmas and some interesting character studies. It was interesting to see how men and women navigated the problems in an ostensibly male-dominated culture. It did stimulate good conversation after it was over. In it's positive qualities, it shared with The Descendants all of the things I've mentioned so far except the \"male-dominated culture.\" On the negative side, it was a half-hour too long. None of the four main adult characters (the two couples) were easy to relate to and none of them demonstrated much growth as individuals across the length of the film. I'd contrast it very much with The Descendants in which difficult problems were presented but there WAS clear character development--the characters in The Descendants evolved and grew. In The Descendants, both characters and plot developed. In A Separation, IMHO, the plot develops but the characters do not. My advice having seen the film last evening? Discount the rave reviews about 40%. Ask yourself the question--do I like movies set in interesting places and presenting difficult dilemmas experienced by interesting characters who don't seem to learn or grow much from the events in the film? If the answer is yes, and clearly for many reviewers and users it was, go see the film.",

About the actors , that is the second experience of Peyman Moaadi who had seen before in last Farhadi's film (About Eli 2009), but he acted more professional than he is , as an intolerant person and doesn't let his family to go to abroad. About actresses , Leila Hatami & Sareh Bayat performed unconventionally great and I think that was the most important movie that they have ever acted in. I hope it will win the Best Foreign Language Film title in 84th Academy Awards. Good Luck for Iranian Movies , Directors , Actors & Actresses and .....",

My only question is how on earth did it take so long for me to do so? I can only put it down to being behind with my film watching because of uni, because A Separation is a fantastic film and deserves all ounces of praise it gets and some. That is my opinion though, because I know people will find that it is not their cup of tea and have no problem with that. What was it I loved about A Separation? A lot of things actually. It was a very well made film. The scenery is striking and authentic, and the cinematography is intrusive and relentlessly, but this adds to the impact of the story rather than detracts from it. Asghar Farhadi's direction similarly is supremely controlled. A Separation is remarkably written as well. The writing is intelligent and insightful, avoiding any kind of melodrama or moralising. Not just that but it succeeds also in exploring the characters without any kind of prejudice, and that is including Hodjat. The story is quite a complicated set-up, but compelling and moving. It gives the audience time to breathe, but with the tension and drama that fuels what is happening in the storytelling I found myself never being able to look away. The characters are sensitively explored, and while I've not seen About Elly in a while I do remember that I didn't relate as much to the characters there than I did here. The acting is wonderful, Leila Hatami(especially good), Peyman Moadi, Shahab Hosseini and Sareh Bayat give performances that wholly justified the sharing of the Silver Berlin Bear. One mustn't forget Sarina Farhadi, whose increasing intensity in her acting is what makes A Separation's storytelling and the case it depicts even more engrossing. In conclusion, one of the best of 2011, considering how hit and miss that year was for films that's saying a bit. 10/10 Bethany Cox",
