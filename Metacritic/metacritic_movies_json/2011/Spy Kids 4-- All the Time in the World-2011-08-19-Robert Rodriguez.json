But in reality, trying to mother Rebecca and Cecil, who clearly don\u2019t want her around, is her toughest challenge yet.  Also, her husband, Wilbur, wouldn\u2019t know a spy if he lived with one which is exactly the case - Marissa\u2019s a retired secret agent. Marissa\u2019s world is turned upside down when the maniacal Timekeeper threatens to take over the planet and she\u2019s called back into action by the head of OSS, home of the greatest spies and where the now-defunct Spy Kids division was created.  With Armageddon quickly approaching, Rebecca and Cecil are thrust into action when they learn their boring stepmom was once a top agent and now the world\u2019s most competitive ten year olds are forced to put their bickering aside and rely on their wits.  With a little help from a couple of very familiar Spy Kids, Carmen and Juni Cortez, and some mind-blowing gadgets, they just may be able to save the world and possibly bring their family together while they\u2019re at it.(The Weinstein Company)\r \u2026 Expand",
