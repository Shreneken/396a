  "critic_reviews": [
    "It goes down like a canned but genial '80s comedy: Without fanfare or much nutrition; part of your balanced breakfast.",
    "Kind of a drag when it resorts to frantic slapstick and tired action-comedy tropes, but modestly engaging during stretches that suggest the project would have worked better as an exuberant musical.",
    "Hilariously horrible when it isn't just plain awful.",
    "John Whitesell's extraordinarily witless movie operates as a checklist for cultural and racial clichés.",
    "Won't likely disappoint fans of men-in-drag comedy but doesn't offer much that's original or funny.",
    "Lawrence's gender-bending jokes are played out, and his slapstick is wooden and slow.",
    "About the only honestly funny thing in the movie is Faizon Love's uncredited performance in the Joe E. Brown role, as the school maintenance man who's immediately smitten with Big Momma.",
    "Star Martin Lawrence, now the sole remaining element from the original \"Big Momma's House\" 11 years ago, looks pretty tired both in and out of makeup here.",
    "Fresh or not, creatively merited or not, here it comes: the third installment of Martin Lawrence's big, dopey franchise.",
    "A humorless mashup of \"White Chicks\" and \"Glee.\"",
    "Whoever demanded a third installment of Lawrence's mirthless mash-up of weak gags and cross-dressing horrors should be imprisoned and forced to watch it on repeat until they repent. Avoid.",
    "The comic, his career now apparently in total free fall, tackles the (dual) role(s) so broadly (no pun intended) that it's just plain annoying.",
    "A film so drained of entertainment or simple humanity it is difficult to relate to as anything other than industrial artifact.",
    "Starved of humor and energy, the interminable Big Mommas: Life Father, Like Son could force Lawrence and co-star Brandon T. Jackson undercover for real."

OMG, Boy was this thee worse movie Ive ever went to the movies to see!! For the first time, I actually couldn't wait for it to be over. This was a total waste of Money. I cant believe people actually have the nerve to give this a 10. For once I actually agree with the critics on this one(rare). The other two 'Big Mommas' was really really good(great) & funny so I thought this one might be worth a watch but boy was I wrong, most movies fail with sequels & this is one of them. I should have trusted my instincts after watching the trailer. I did get approximately 3 laughs but that's nothing compared to the others, not much of a compliment here. This was quite utterly a Tasteless Comedy all the way through, It starts off slow, you hope it gets better but it hardly does, It wasnt even pieced together right. This was not good at all. Dont listen to the good reviews. It was actually Cringe Worthy & thats thee worse thing that can be said about any film, I was Embarrassed for the makers. Everything about it was wrong, it was awful, take it from me. Not Recommended.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nFollowing in his father's footsteps, Trent(Brandon T. Jackson) falls for, in the immortal words of the late Rick James, \"a very kinky girl,\" just like his dear old sweet mama. Like father, like son, indeed, or maybe it's just sloppy writing. A decade ago, in Raja Gosnell's \"Big Momma's House\", FBI agent Malcolm Turner(Martin Lawrence), a master of disguise, first put on his fat suit and wig as part of a federal investigation against Sherry Pierce(Nia Long), Trent's mother, whom the bureau had suspected of laundering money stolen by her thuggish boyfriend(Terrence Howard) during a holdup in the bank where she worked as a teller. Disguised as the person of interest's aunt, try as he might, Malcolm simply could not relate to his target as a 400-pound(by conservative estimates) mammy. His attention for Sherry would prove to be problematic, especially in the scene where the supposed niece crawls into bed with the undercover agent, and nearly blows his cover when their immediate closeness triggers a physiological change in the cross-dresser's anatomy. Although a flashlight explains away the first initial concentration of blood(obviously reallocated from his brain), Malcolm's state of sexual arousal persists, so when Sherry gets no answer to her inquiry about a possible second flashlight, as it's edited(the filmmaker cuts away to the next set-up), the moviegoer wonders if she eventually vacates herself from the highly-charged bed, because from her perspective, Hattie May Pierce must either be a man, or a hermaphrodite. In \"Big Momma's: Like Father, Like Son\", Trent(formerly played by Jascha Washington in the series' first two entries), an aspiring rap star, pays homage to his mother of indeterminate sexual orientation by dating a girl whose taste in potential partners are simpatico. Oblivious to his feminine environs, a school of the arts for girls, Trent pees standing up, just as Haley(Jessica Lewis), a talented pianist, sets foot into the dorm room, and similar to Sherry, the singer-songwriter seems unfazed by the implied organ-related anomaly at hand, since the force of the outgoing liquid in concert with the abiding urinal, would suggest a sex-based discomfiture of startling proportions. And yet, Trent goes unquestioned, despite being an obvious drag queen(Lawrence is marginably more successful as a woman), and continues to be accepted as being woman-like, which conveys an ambivalence in Haley about the second, more radical possibility. As his alter-ego Charmaine, the self-proclaimed \"Prodigy\" is ever mindful of staying in character as it relates to sexual boundaries, unlike his father who, after learning that Sherry had committed no crime, forgets his put-upon identity and kisses her, not particularly chaste-like, a beat too long, full, on the lips. Instead of reacting in outright horror and disbelief, Sherry gives Big Momma a look that intimates the opposite. Yes, \"Big Momma's House\" establishes the future Mrs. Turner as straight, but still, as a result of some slipshod writing, there's these gaps that preside over her ostensible heterosexuality. Likewise, in \"Big Momma's: Like Father, Like Son\", Haley falls for a man, the rapper(also a nascent Duke student), but perhaps she concurrently falls for the perceived hermaphrodite, as well. When Haley first lays eyes on \"Charmaine\" in the cafeteria from \"Fame\", she looks thunderstruck, giving the homely a frank appraisal of \"her\" loveliness(it must be love) with her twinkling eyes and outstretched mouth. At the year-end showcase(in other words, talent show), because Trent needs to remain incognito from his gun-totin' pursuers, he replaces himself with his doppleganger femme, who performs the hip-hop-tinged love ballad that he collaborated with Haley, a song in which the girl tells the hermaphrodite \"you're the air that I breathe\".",
