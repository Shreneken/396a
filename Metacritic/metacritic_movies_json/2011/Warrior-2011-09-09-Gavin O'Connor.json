As Tommy blazes a violent path towards the title prize, his brother, Brendan, a former MMA fighter unable to make ends meet as a public school teacher, returns to the amateur ring to provide for his family. Even though years have passed, recriminations and past betrayals keep Brendan bitterly estranged from both Tommy and his father. But when Brendan's unlikely rise as an underdog sets him on a collision course with Tommy, the two brothers must finally confront the forces that tore them apart, all the while waging the most intense, winner-takes-all battle of their lives.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "It hardly rewrites the rulebook, but Warrior is a powerful, moving and brilliant sports-pic-cum-family drama. Like \"The Fighter,\" but with kicking.",
    "For all its titular bravado, Warrior never lets the audience forget the economic and spiritual desperation driving its two main characters, who bleed for the screaming arena crowd in exchange for their shots at redemption, and offer a rare glimpse of soul in a type of film that usually isn't obliged to provide one.",
    "Warrior is a surprising gut punch, a modern-day \"Rocky\" saga with two mixed martial arts pugs trying to beat, choke and kick the system.",
    "One of the most heart-wrenching and deeply felt films of the year.",
    "It is appropriately blunt, powerful and relentless, a study of male bodies in sweaty motion and masculine emotions in teary turmoil.",
    "It's a long movie that feels short: It grabs you in early scenes, intense though low-key before all hell breaks loose, then keeps you riveted to its mostly male characters.",
    "Starts out so promisingly that it's a huge disappointment when it ultimately becomes way too predictable - and unbelievable. It's as if \"Raging Bull\" suddenly morphed into \"Rocky.\"",
    "O'Connor gives the film a dark, moody look, which is the best choice for so many roiling emotions. This is not a traditional stand-up-and-cheer fight movie; the undercurrents are too strong and deep.",
    "This high-powered sports melodrama benefits from its strong male leads, a sinewy narrative, and the maverick attitude of MMA. But for all the contemporary references, it's essentially a spin on the story of Cain and Abel, which may be the reason it feels timeless.",
    "It's a surprisingly moving film. While the fight scenes are unquestionably thrilling, the movie's best bits are not about winning and losing but about pain and, ultimately, forgiveness.",
    "Old line-gargler Nolte remains an effortlessly moving presence, while Hardy and Edgerton embody their archetypes and handle the physical demands.",
    "Though Warrior excels at the big stuff-fighting sequences and rousing crowds and victories that all but force audiences to stand up and cheer - the film is at its very best in the small moments, the little looks.",
    "An improbably effective and affecting mix of raw emotions and exciting smackdowns.",
    "Warrior is a weirdly affecting hybrid, a 100-proof melodrama that's two-thirds Sylvester Stallone and one-third Eugene O'Neill. Think Rocky's \"Long Day's Journey into Night.\"",
    "This is brutish, visceral stuff - a type of raw-meat violence that's undeniably cinematic but seems, to this worried parent, ill-fitted for PG-13.",
    "Warrior is a relentless, emotionally engaging family drama and underdog saga with touches of \"Rocky\" mixed with \"The Fighter.\"",
    "The catharsis Warrior offers in the end is hard won, and it will take a steely viewer not to find it gratifying, however over-the-top it may be.",
    "Warrior aspires to myth. It's Cain and Abel battling it out in the face of a decidedly ungodly father before humanity goes down for the count. Strong stuff.",
    "The two leads, Edgerton and Hardy, pull off their respective roles - rising above the cliches and the melodrama - with ferocity and focus.",
    "The film is a brutally effective, insanely rousing piece of drama, with enough new wrinkles and ferocious acting to sweep you into its clutches.",
    "This is a rare fight movie in which we don't want to see either fighter lose. That brings such complexity to the final showdown that hardly anything could top it - but something does, and Warrior earns it.",
    "It overcomes inescapable boxing and martial arts clichés and leaves you thoroughly sated, energized and wanting more.",
    "Warrior is a straight genre picture, a fight movie of the old school. But it's a mixed martial arts tale, and as such, it's the best MMA movie ever.",
    "O'Conner continues to exhibit a deft knack for melding interpersonal drama with\r\nathletic competition in ways that, despite his tales' clichés, earn their\r\nmelodramatic manipulations through genuine empathy for characters' plights.",
    "Mostly, Warrior is a showcase for its up-and-coming stars. Edgerton, from last year's \"Animal Kingdom,\" and Hardy, who stole scenes as the identity forger in \"Inception.\"",
    "Warrior becomes increasingly shameless until, by the end, with the big fights fought, we are clearly meant to rise as one and applaud the indomitability of the human spirit. But the only indomitable thing about Warrior are its clichés.",
    "Warrior resists many opportunities to seal an easy resolution, and for this you remain with it until the final punch.",
    "This is bench-press melodrama, and it's as manipulative as anything Bette Davis or Jane Wyman ever starred in. You can't abide the shamelessness of any of it.",
    "Every time you start resisting, somehow the film makes the sale, again.",
    "Has moments of power that push through a fake-out script.",
    "It shows promise but finally hits things so hard, both literally and metaphorically, that it's hard not to feel pummeled yourself by the time it's over.",
    "Yet it still works like gangbusters - tears will be stifled by the end of the sibling vs. sibling finale - and most of the credit should go to Hardy, Nolte and Edgerton.",
    "Warrior's three principle characterizations are compelling - Nolte in particular gives a tempered performance as the shambling, sad-eyed wreck of a dad - but not enough to mask the film's lesser elements.",
    "O'Connor chucks away everything that was interesting or dark or subtle in Warrior and replaces it with a pseudo-individualist, sub-Freudian, Tea Party-friendly fantasy.",
    "A cheap exploitation picture wrapped in miles and miles of stale would-be Oscar scenes."

Yes, it goes a little overboard with the extreme close-ups, and the scenes involving Nolte over the last half hour of the film could have been reworked, but Hardy & Edgerton are fantastic.  I'm amazed that the fighting looks as real as it does - the days of the \"Rocky\" pulled punches which look mega-fake are over.  No, you don't see everything, but you don't get lost in the closeness of the action.  Yes, the movie is a touch long, but it's absolutely worth seeing.  I'm a little mystified that it didn't do better than $5mil on opening weekend.",

I saw te good reviews on here and from working at my local regal theater and seeing everyone come out of this movie pleased and raving about how good it was, i figured hey, why not. So i just saw it and wow! Was i blown away. I loved this movie, it started off a little slow but dont get me wrong, every scene played a big part in the overrall feel of the movie. Their was so much drama and heart packed into this film. You must go see this. You will love it. I wanted to cry, and i wanted to cheer, their were so many different emotions in thks one movie. Dont shy away from the long running time, it is so worth it, its one of those movies where you hate it because of the way you feel for the characters but then you love it at the same time. This is the best movie of september hands down, doesnt matter what else is coming out, Warrior is here now and it is damn good. On another note im really glad to see Tom Hardy fit for his role as Bane in Christopher Nolans final entry into his highly successful Batman trilogy. Anyways, Tom Hardy was excellemt, Joel Edgerton was excellent, and not familiar with the actor of the fathers name is but he did an academy award nodded performance. I will be upset if this movie doesn't get any Oscar nominations, it deserves ateast one. Go see this movie, you'll love it....and hate it, haha. Definitely 10/10 stars for sure.",

I felt the same way about The Fighter last year and ended up loving it. Let me tell you, I was so shocked how great this movie was. It has the genres usual clichÃ©s but the movie used them so well and to its advantage that it felt fresh. Sure it's predictable in the end, but sometimes, in this case, it's not about the destination(the ending), it's the journey to get to the destination. Even though this movie was 2 hours and 20 minutes it felt like 20 minutes, pretty fast journey I know, and that's a shame because I never wanted this movie to end. The characters are so great and well-developed that I felt for them throughout the movie, I cared about them, I felt their pain, and the amazing performances from the cast helped contribute to that. Especially Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, and Nick Nolte who give outstanding performances. I will be so shocked if not one of them are nominated. Everything else about this movie is just fantastic and hell I even cried twice during the last act of the movie. The action was gripping, the script was great, it was nicely shot especially during the fighting scenes, which I must warn you the camera does get a bit shaky but it's for a reason at least, and the score was just great it really added that extra dept to the scenes. I am not a big sports movie fan but I loved this movie, so even if you don't like sports movie I can guarantee that most of you will love.",

You're rooting for all of them each with their own promises to fulfill. Tom Hardy's Tommy is just outstanding, the level of intensity showcased is unbelievably scary. Joel Edgerton's Brendan who is trying to make ends meet as a school teacher moonlights as a fighter in parking lots after hours to provide for his family and Nick Nolte's heart-breaking performance as the willing-to-do-anything-to-make-it-right-again estranged father of his two distant sons. And that barely scratched the surface of their story, the depth of the characters is amazingly rich. The first half of the movie builds the foundation for the brothers, their present lives, their rough childhood and their own motivations to get back in the cage, it's as exciting and entertaining as the fighting scenes itself. There's about 4-5 climaxes in Warrior it's outstanding. Unlike a lot of sports/boxing movies we've seen you feel the high-octane scenes. You're really immersed in the fighting sequences, you feel every punch, every kick, every takedown and every headlock because you care about the characters, you know the journey of how they got where they are and you know all too well their hopes and promises to the people they care for.",

I also hated the fact that 2 unknown, unranked fighters got into a tournament with the best middleweights in the world. Brendan was barely a .500 fighter in his prime (that means barely kept his wins and losses even) and Tommy is an unknown fighter with no professional experiance who only got in because he KOed a top ranked guy during sparring and he was a war hero. Again really unrealistic.\r The plot does take away greatly from the movie but it is still a satisfying movie that is well worth the watch.",

Its an extremly real and extremely touching story that transcends the sport the movie revolves around.

The emotional moments are gripping and you feel for the characters, even if their situations are as predictable as they can get (e.g. man fighting to get his family out of financial straits). The story is actually incredibly predictable, and I knew who was going to triumph at the end of it all. The action is fast-paced, and often brutal but enjoyably so. I actually felt my muscles tense up at specific points during the film, even after I had a firm grasp of how everything was going to turn out. I still had to tell myself to relax, because of the intensity of the fights as well as the intensity seem in emotions of the main characters. This movie makes me excited to see more of Hardy in the near future (Dark Knight Rises, anyone?). I have been recommending this film to anyone who is willing to listen to me.

My first glance, I thought it's gonna be like The Fighter since this film is about fighting sports and there's a brother relationship. But here, the brothers are against to each other. The film doesn't really spend so much time dealing with their relationship. It mostly goes to the father of the main leads. Tom Hardy (Tommy Conlon) delivers a moving and emotional performance of a man who has suffered greatly from the ones he loves, and from the field of battle, an all to real reality for people of today. While the younger Tommy suffered the loss of his mother firsthand, his older brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton)has put together a life that a man dreams of, yet is still haunted daily by his past. Only to have it threatened to be destroyed by the bank. Nick Nolte the alcoholic father of the two, has suffered years of remorse and regret from the abuse of alcohol and the neglect of his wife and children is trying to forge a bond but is meeting a stone wall with both of his sons. The fighting, though it is very well acted and shot, is not about fighting. It is the physical representation of the struggle between the three men, the struggle to forget and forgive and to move on. The demons that possess all three of these men are of such great proportion, the only way they can be relinquished is for them to come together. Definitely a must see movie this year!",

The actors in this movie played there roles brilliantly, Tom Hardy probably played his role the best. Tom Hardy played a serious, aggressive character \"Tommy\" who's in it to win it, and won't stop until he gets what he wants. Joel Edgerton plays as \"Brendan\" who is Tommy's brother in the movie, who is a school teacher trying to provide money and food for his family, then he decides he wants to fight in a parking lot because he can earn a lot of money. Nick Nolte another brilliant actor, played as the father of the two sons. Who is trying to get the family back together but is on drugs and struggles. The fighting in this movie is Excellent, especially with the addition of former Olympic Gold Medalist, Kurt Angle played his role as a dangerous Russian fighting who doesn't get the chance to talk in the movie, but lets his fighting do the talking for him. Overall, this movie is AMAZING. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Sports/ MMA/Fighting movies obviously, and anyone who enjoys very dramatic & Inspiring stories. So even if your not the \"biggest\" MMA Fan i guarantee you will still love this movie.",

It does not try to give great big background stories, or hugely emotional 'have it all out' redemption.  It let you see the pain each character feels, let you guess at some of the experiences these characters had gone through.  Words DONT solve everything, and they certainly dont always help.  Much of our lives and relationships are subconciously built around things Unspoken, and this movie recognises this and therefore makes its interactions more honest becuase of it.Also, the fight scenes were spot on.  Honestly brutal, while not being overly bloodthirsty.  If your fighting at that level, you need focus.  Without it, your just brawling.  The overwhelming intensity of Tommy (Tom Hardy) is almost shocking.  Made more so becuase there is no boasting, no glorification, no real menace to him, he is just that strong, just that physically powerful.  This contrasts with his brother who has little actual physical presence, but a focus and a drive that makes it possible for him to challenge at this level.  i.e. Tommy knocks you out, Brenden taps you out etc.Part of the power of the enstrangement in this film is that Brenden is just as eager for forgiveness and reconcilliation from his younger brother as their father is, even while he struggles with unreconcilled jelousy from the attention 'Tommy' got from their father (who was training Tommy in junior wrestling).  While Tommy is just a huge powerderkeg of continued PTS, Survivors guilt and emotional abandonment.To be honest, I think it might have been a bit too suble and unspoken on occasion, so many people who have not had any similar expeciences, or known anyone who had, may not have grasped the true ramifications of what was left unspoken.  In particular the Surviors guilt for Tommy and Brenden's first true understanding of the regret that unresolved guilt brings.  I thought it was a brilliant movie.  Entertaining, powerful, interesting and quality. It was not shown at a lot of cinema's in America (prob becuase of the whole 'friendly fire' issue) so it wont make the money it normally would, but I expect it will do a brisk trade on DVD.  And to be honest it was not really advertised as the emotional sucker punch it actually was.  The fighting, while entertaining, wasnt the focal point of the movie at all.  Becuase of this its viewing base may be mislead.  A lot of people who would truly enjoy this movie may be scared off by the apparent physical violence of it.  If you are one of those people, go watch it.  It is seriously worth it.",

Back stories and history of the two and what role their father plays is brought in gradually and in an interesting manner.Yes, the first part of the film may be quite long, and may be boring in the minds of people who adore action, but once the film enters the second part, pure adrenaline-pumping suspense kicks its way onto the big screen. I've watched tons of movies, from nearly all genres, but never have I watched a film that captures true and gritty combat in such a realistic way. The fight choreography is superb. Add to that the fact that the fight scenes are captured using a wobbly camera, making the fights all the more realistic. Many may dislike this realistic touch, but I loved it, because it helps you to integrate your mindset with that of the characters, that is, it aids in reflecting the emotions and desires of the two characters. During some moments, I sincerely felt like I was the one taking hits. The camera angles, the shakiness, and the excellent fight choreography make this film a masterpiece in the realistic aspect of it all.To top it all off, the two brothers are both \"heroes\", but it ultimately depends on personal preference when it comes to differentiating good from bad.The best film of 2011?

There is far too little focus on the relationship between the two brothers and many questions are left unanswered as to their falling out and whether the relationship between both brothers are reconciled with the father. Then the fact that the film seemed at times a commercial for Tapout with all of the not so subtle advertisements also downgrades the overall quality of the film.

A movie that really left me feeling bad ass afterwards. My definition of a good movie is when after watching it, if you're laying in your bed unable to fall asleep, you place yourself in the movie and re-enact it. That's the case with warrior. Watching Tom Hardy clothesline an overconfident made me want to jump out of my chair cheering. I loved the story, i thought the acting was fantastic and i recommend this to anyone over 15. It isn't a family movie, and it certainly isn't a movie for hardcore MMA fans looking for accurate fights. It's one of those movies where you hate it or love it. And i ABSOLUTELY LOVED it.

They outdid themselves; they performed with the skills of veterans, not overreaching and maintaining their respective character's persona. Nolte was obviously perfect for the part; Hardy, of who I am now a fan, is far more versatile than you may think (I've seen several films in which he was supporting actor). Edgerton did hold his own, not weakening the top tier cast (I'm not yet a fan, so am slightly reserved in my praise). The supporting cast, talented and hot looking Jennifer Morrison in particular, did as fine a job with her role as Amy Adam did in 'Fighter', and the rest helped make this movie as good as it is.\r The script was very well done, going by the result on screen; I'm sure writer/director Gavin O'Connor was investing all of himself in this project and he has every reason to be proud. This is drama as gripping as the first 'Rocky' and last year's 'The Fighter', better even, given it's not based on a real life story. I think the lack of budget for marketing and publicity may be the reason it did not fare as well as it should have at the theater box office; so buy it, or rent it and have your friends do the same. They won't be disappointed one bit.",

The movie presents dynamic, strained relationships and the bond of family, coupled with the challenging choices we must make throughout life.\r The narrative focuses on three men: estranged brothers Tom and Brendan Conlon (Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton) and their father, Paddy (Nick Nolte). Tom, a withdrawn marine, has come home to Pittsburgh to train for a spot in \"Sparta,\" a winner-takes-all MMA tournament held in Atlantic City. He is willing to put aside his abusive upbringing in return for his assistance in training. Paddy, a recovering alcoholic, embraces the opportunity to reconnect with his son, even though Tom makes is clear that their relationship will consist strictly as one of trainer and fighter.\r Meanwhile, across the state in Philadelphia, former UFC fighter and current high school teacher Brendan finds himself in need of cash in order to save his home from foreclosure. Against the wishes of Brendan's wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison), Brendan becomes involved in low-level MMA contests, and suspended by the school board once word spreads. One would need be hopelessly naïve not to recognize that this is all going to come down to a match between Tom and Brendan, with a torn father on the sidelines. The first half of the film is mostly devoted to the dramatic setup and character development, before it launches into the Atlantic City bouts that take up the majority of the second half of the film.\r \"Warrior\" offers strong performances across the board, two of which are standouts. Tom Hardy, who redefined his career with his screen-searing work in \"Bronson,\" (2008) is simply tremendous. The word \"volcanic\" was often used to describe Hardy's work in \"Bronson,\" and it applies here as well. Nick Nolte, who has received his share of accolades over a long and prosperous career, provides a terrific performance as a remorseful father who is desperate to reconnect with his sons.\r This real battle here is outside of the cage, involving redemption, reconciliation, and putting demons to rest. O'Connor's filming has a gritty, grainy, sensibility that is only enhanced by utilizing locations around  the Pittsburgh area. Putting aside the fighting in the cage, it's the emotional tussle they must contend with that is far more daunting than any opponent in the cage. \"Warrior\" has the heart of a champion that keeps this film alive and pumping to the bloody end.",

It seems like an ordinary action/fighting but one must not be deceived by the looks of this film, there's 'Extra' delight in it. warrior features a less-popular cast which includes Joel Edgerton, Tom Hardy, Nick Nolte and Jeniffer Morisson.\r Perhaps the biggest letdown of Warrior is the clichés which it possesses. It follows the route of many mediocre films, a character is equipped with insufficient talent or experience, faces a problem, joins a competition or goes for a fight and ultimately achieves victory, and you will see that in Warrior.\r Despite being clichéd, it is still well-occupied with a properly written screenplay. Fine dialogue throughout the movie and what makes Warrior a worthy experience is the moving elements that it contains. A fiercely moving motion picture is what Warrior is.\r The fighting scenes of the film, which takes up the majority of the movie's moments, are choreographed wonderfully. Having established a fine direction for it's action scenes during the movie's final hours, is like witnessing a real MMA matches in high definition, rather than watching a film, and I think that is an utmost quality of movie-making and I could conclude that Gavin O'Connor is a promising, talented and 'far above the level of mediocrity' filmmaker.\r The acting performances in this film are spectacular. Tom hardy plays Tommy Conlon whose character is disturbed by past events which made him 'harder'. Hardy's performance in this film is so good that I would say 'It could have knocked me out for a second' and I think Tom Hardy is one of the most consistent actors working in Hollywood today. On the other side of the note, there is Joel Edgerton, a completely unknown Australian actor to me, who plays Brendan Conlon and too gives a delightful performance. The element which makes Edgerton's delivery is good is the naturalistic materials which he possessed, and he's well composed too. But, in my opinion, the actor which stands out from the rest is Nick Nolte. His portrayal of a father filled with mistakes moved me much. In addition, Nolte's perfect navigation on his body movement, facial expression and verbal communication is perfect and that will lead to a conclusion that Nick Nolte is a very skilled actor.\r Yes, Warrior is very much clichéd, but I guess those clichés are neutralized by fine performances and impeccable moving moments. A great film, but not a masterpiece for sure.\r (http://www.rottentomatoes.com/member/AlexDesmall) (http://facebook.com/alex.desmall) Twitter (Alex_DeSmall)",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nSports films are hard to make these days. They’ve fallen into the same trap as romantic comedies and horror movies, in that almost every variation of their plotlines has been done. The ragtag group of underdogs came together and won! Or they lost, but learned a valuable lesson in the process! It’s a problem that all films have to face, but it becomes magnified when it comes to sports films. So how do does a film combat this problem? Well, Warrior’s strategy is to steep its film in realism, get top notch performances from the actors, and above all, understand the sport that the film is about.\r Director Gavin O’Connor is no stranger to sports films, having previously directed the film Miracle, about the 1980 upset of the US hockey team over the Soviet Union. Both of his films express a wealth of knowledge for each sport, from how they’re filmed and commentated upon, to the actual strategy and action on screen. The main characters, Tommy (Tom Hardy) and Brendan (Joel Edgerton), are brothers and mixed martial arts fighters who compete in a high profile tournament put together by a rich MMA fan. Both Tommy and Brendan are in it for the money more than anything else, as both have families that they need to support. Nick Nolte and Jennifer Morrison also star as their father and Brendan’s wife respectively.\r As I said before, O’Connor seems to have a firm grasp of MMA, as the fight scenes in Warrior are incredibly realistic. This not only helps raise the tension for the viewer, but also allows them to believe that they are investing in a live sporting event. Outside the ring however, is the true greatness of the film.\r Working with relatable characters, the actors are able to craft fantastic performances. Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte (who was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar) are the true standouts. Hardy, a veteran with a fierce exterior but a complex interior, is able to both convincingly destroy opponents in the ring and deliver an emotional gut punch to the audience. Meanwhile, Nolte is incredible to watch as a former alcoholic trying to make amends with his family.\r While I’ve praised the film for being realistic, there are some elements that are a little hard to believe. For\rinstance, Tommy is shown to possess almost superhuman fighting ability and strength, at one point even ripping a door off of a tank.\r Just toning him down wouldn’t have hurt, and maybe even improved his storyline. Another minor quibble is how easily the two amateur fighters are able to enter into a tournament with other world famous fighters. Finally, like most films centered on sports, the film’s ending is fairly predictable.\r Overall, Warrior is a refreshing take on a genre infamously known for its limitations. Taking the feel good, underdog aspect of Rocky and combining it with elements of a family drama like The Fighter (also about brothers who fight) makes this film stand out on its own. For both MMA and film fans, this one is a winner.",

While I am biased, and therefore tempted to say the sport is \"better\",  I realize such statements about unquantifiables is silly and hard to justify. I can say that mma is more impressive than any other sport for relatively obvious reasons. A fight is scarier and more demanding than hours of any team sport. The danger is greater. The sport itself transcends our cultural, temporal preferences in games...fighting is inherent to humanity unlike any other athletic text, along with maybe running. Great acting and a well crafted, if standard, plot. Well done emotional moments without the overt manipulation of \"average\" conceptual intelligence most films use.

I felt genuinely moved the first time I saw this and after watching simply just listened to the ending credits music. Moreover, a long and arduous training scheme was set out for both Edgerton and Hardy as they prepared to shoot realistic scenes for the film, which turned out brilliantly, and accompanied by raw and ultimately very human performances, made the action and acting scenes believable, relate-able, and moving. A masterpiece of character design and intuitive dialogue this film is a must watch for any movie fans of any sort.",

From the start, the family members are depicted as very much being quite distant from one another, with one being clearly a lot more down and out than the other. With quite dour and solemn music playing in the background, its also clear that their both relatively tired (physically, mentally and quite possibly emotionally speaking) as well. There is a certain atmosphere present from this first initial scene, although it sets the tone as being quite bleak, understandably so but I suppose I should say that it isn't the best of films to see if your looking for a constantly wonderfully happy film, put it that way!.The camerawork is a bit jerky at times - the scenes featuring said martial arts being practiced or during competitions/tournaments are quite frenetic, with many camera angles used. It has quite a gritty, urban feel to it. At times a split screen is used to show one of the brothers training, in the ring, while another is out running. The chronology of the film appears to be quite wide, with it quickly depicting many days or weeks worth of time, hence the pace is relatively quick.Its fair to say that the plot isn't exactly greatly original - there are some cliches present, with it being a sports related drama film with a heavy emphasis on family and the toll that being a sportsperson can have on you but it is a fairly tense and watchable film regardless. There are clearly unanswered questions from relatively early on but, somewhat frustratingly, as a viewer we're not really made aware of the full background of the brothers and what may have entirely driven such a big wedge between them. Having said that, it did make me feel a bit intrigued and curious to see what we might learn as the plot developed. The characterisation is fairly good but I found myself feeling that it was perhaps a little over 'Hollywood-ised', in that it didn't come across as entirely realistic and believable. There seemed to be an air of exaggerated melodrama somehow, although I'm not sure I can entirely put my finger on it.Cast wise, Joel Edgerton plays Brendan Conlon, while his brother Tommy is played by Tom Hardy and the father, Paddy Conlon, is played by Nick Nolte. They do certainly look the part of gritty, hard done by street fighters trying to get by but I felt I somehow didn't quite buy in to the full picture. Other cast members include Jennifer Morrison, as Tess Conlon and Frank Grillo, as Frank Campana. Nolte's performance was probably the most noteable for me overall.I found myself confused by the plot and not able to keep track of precisely what was going on, during pivotal scenes. At times the plot pace is quite fast and slick, while at other times it seemed a little slow. I feel the script wasn't the best overall. There is definitely a depressing bleakness to it but in a way I suppose thats a good thing, as I imagine thats what the filmmakers were trying to convey. I also found myself noticing a role reversal element which was interesting for a while but I won't give any spoilers. The basic concept is nothing new, although in this day and age (politically/culturally/economically speaking) its maybe more relevant than ever, the whole 'people trying to make a name for themselves, to rise above their circumstances' etc. but with various scenes taking place in Las Vegas and there being aerial camera shots used, panning across the many Vegas casinos and other establishments at night, with their lights shining bright, there was a definite tacky-ness to it. There is something sadly profoundly depressing about aspects of this but its not as if it hasn't been done before, numerous times. Content wise, the film contains one or two brief sex references and very brief/partial nudity, plus obviously violence in terms of the martial arts tournaments. There is also strong language and a character is depicted as being an alcoholic, with heavy drink use depicted, although its not really glamorised as such.No, I wouldn't particualrly recommend this film. There are plenty of other, similar films around - I just didn't think this one was especially memorable.",
