  "critic_reviews": [
    "It's hard to imagine now just how astonishing it was to interrupt the action with a sun-lit frolic on a new-fangled bicycle as the whimsical Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head burbles away in the background.",
    "It is a great film and will be an exceptionally popular and profitable one.",
    "Note-perfect performances, a screenplay steeped in both nostalgia and a timely sense of insight, and anti-heroes you can't help but love.",
    "Though Hall's stunning vistas and gorgeous exploration of wide-open spaces hearken back to John Ford, Butch Cassidy otherwise radiates the youthful energy, manic pop playfulness, and antic clowning of the French New Wave.",
    "It is much better and funnier than the \"The Sting\" precisely because it allows the two stars to play off each other.",
    "The movie is jovial without being silly; it retains the sense of adventure that characterizes the Western, but replaces the often somber mood with one that is airy and, at times, almost comedic.",
    "Butch Cassidy's winking awareness of its own cinematic nature (from the opening \"silent movie\" train robbery to the famous closing freeze frame) and witty banter give the story a degree of charm and exuberance.",
    "Action dwells upon the misadventures of the pair as they pursue the outlaw trail, but more importantly, packs the type of fast movement the title indicates.",
    "The over-all production is very handsome, and the performances fine, especially Newman, Redford, and Miss Ross, who must be broadly funny and straight, almost simultaneously.",
    "This good movie is buried beneath millions of dollars that were spent on \"production values\" that wreck the show.",
    "George Roy Hill's 1969 film moves with steady, stupid grace from oozy sentimentality to nihilistic violence.",
    "Every character, every scene, is marred by the film's double view, which oscillates between sympathy and farce."

The chemistry between Paul Newman and Robert Redford is infectious as one picks up right where the other left off the entire film. It was also unexpectedly quite funny, as the one liners were just priceless and show why the screenplay has received so much praise and why it deserves all of that praise. As with most of these classic westerns, the cinematography and set pieces were phenomenal and in this one, the action sequences were great and incredibly intense. The chase sequences were also great and I love how we are kept in the dark as to who is following them, just as they do not know. While I loved this, there were some definite negatives. First of all, there was no real plot, other than focusing on the exploits of Butch and Sundance, though it does not really go anywhere. Not a major complaint, but a complaint nonetheless. Another small complaint would be the pacing, as at times it got a tad too slow, but throughout much of the film, the slow pace was never that much of a problem. My main complaint would be Katharine Ross. Her acting here, in my opinion, was just flat out bad. I never really bought into her character and she was severely outclassed by her two legendary castmates.",

And one of the best I've ever seen. The characters are what really sell this movie the most, Newman and Redford play their roles so well that without them I wonder if the movie would work at all. It's too bad that so many of the \"film experts\" seemed to entirely miss the point of the movie-but the audiences love it, and the film is regarded by many to be among the greatest Western films made-for a good reason. I don't want to start rambling on and on about how amazing it is, so I'll stop-you go see it yourself, and nothing else will need to be said. Great stuff.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \n\"Gorge Cassidy\" (Paul Newman), a.k.a. \"Butch Cassidy\", and \"Lonny Longbaugh\" (Robert Redoford), a.k.a. \"The Sundance Kid, are two of the greatest robbers in the history of the Old West. They pulled jobs on banks and trains with an expertise that made them famous from coast to coast.\r Now, years after being out of the business for about two decades, they decide to pull one last bank heist in Bolivia, with the help of a school teacher (Katharine Ross) with romantic ties to both men.\r I have to say that I am pretty disappointed in this film. I found it to be slow, with not enough action considering the topic of the movie. It dragged so much that I noticed spending more attention to my computer than watching the movie itself on cable television.\r One thing that stood out was the on-screen relationship between Newman and Redford. This is what carries the movie I believe, and most likely why this movie is called a classic now. You feel as if the two are not just partners in crime, but friends with the ribbing that they give one another.\r Another problem with this movie is the soundtrack. The only piece of music that is memorable is Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head by BJ Thomas, and that was a weird tune for a Western set in the Old West. If you ask me, the song was just an odd choice.\r I also barely enjoyed Ross as \"Etta Place\". Her character was barely developed if you asked me. It appeared that she was there as a romantic interest, and to help teach \"Butch\" and \"Sundance\" Spanish for their attempt at robbing the Bolivian bank.\r If you expect a lot of gunfights, you are mistaken on this one. Of what there is in the movie, they are short and well placed.\r The cinematography is hard for me to judge since Encore Westerns used a pan-and-scan format. I had to deal with only half of a scene when two people were talking to one another. But, from wide shots, I could see some spectacular scenery, including the famous scene when the title characters jump from a cliff into the water.\r Because it was declared a classic, I've been wanting to see this movie. I am highly disappointed in it.",

The cinematography is fabulous, doing perfect justice to the beautiful scenery.

The script is witty and infectious, not to mention memorable, and the direction and pace I had no problem with either. Robert Redford and especially Paul Newman are perfect as the charismatic outlaws and their chemistry is simply unforgettable. All in all, just a great movie and one of my favourites of the genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

This isn't a western film, like I maybe accidentally assumed it to be, although it does have a western feel to it. Its not full of action, though there is plenty of that at times. Its a good character driven drama, with some very witty dialogue and some quite amusing scenes, plus some reasonably tense moments too. I could have done without the montage mid way through shot in old fashioned brown  - with music playing over still shots but I guess it helps tell the story of what isn't being shown on screen, namely the two criminals travelling to Bolivia. I found the incidental music played in the background a short while later quite amusing too. I was surprised how entertaining and amusing this was really. Also I can't not compliment it on the great wide landscape shots. The cinematography certainly isn't bad. Given this film dates from 1969, it stands up quite well and I'd certainly recommend this.",
