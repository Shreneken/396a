  "critic_reviews": [
    "To see The Thin Man is to watch him (Powell) embodying a personal style that could have been honored, but could never be imitated.",
    "A murder story with a brilliant cast, a brilliant script, brilliant direction, and photography that tells the story in no mean terms.",
    "What really makes The Thin Man an enduring classic, though, is the interplay between Powell and Loy, one of the greatest happily married couples ever to flicker on a screen.",
    "Tense and slick, this early thriller remains a true masterpiece.",
    "What enchants, really, is the relationship between Nick and Nora as they live an eternal cocktail hour, bewailing hangovers that only another little drink will cure, in a marvellous blend of marital familiarity and constant courtship, pixillated fantasy and childlike wonder.",
    "Nick and Nora Charles are one of the screen's great couples.",
    "Powell and Loy's light, witty, unflappable characterizations became the unwavering backbone of a terrific series.",
    "An excellent combination of comedy and excitement.",
    "Director W.S. Van Dyke and married co-writers Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich leavened the novel's hard-boiled tone and grim wit. The result is less a detective story with occasional flashes of humor than a light comedy set against a backdrop of murder.",
    "As Nick and Nora Charles, William Powell and Myrna Loy function as the most sophisticated, insolent, and healthy married couple on-screen.",
    "The Thin Man was an entertaining novel, and now it's an entertaining picture."
