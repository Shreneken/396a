    "critic_reviews": [
        "Today, nearly fifty years after it was made, Rashomon has lost none of its fascination or power. It's still a marvelous piece of cinema that asks unanswerable questions of great import.",
        "The wonder of Rashomon is that while the shadowplay of truth and memory is going on, we are absorbed by what we trust is an unfolding story.",
        "It was the film that introduced the world at large to master director Akira Kurosawa and his frequent, infinitely watchable star Toshiro Mifune.",
        "One of the most brilliantly constructed films of all time, RASHOMON is a monument to Akira Kurosawa's greatness, combining his well-known humanism with an experimental narrative style that has become a hallmark of film history.",
        "Every element in the film, from the dense thicket of forest branches to master cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa's deceptive framing and lighting design, is precisely calibrated to make the facts more difficult to discern.",
        "Kurosawa is always worth a look but this is a particular classic that has influenced so much to come, it's almost essential.",
        "Akira Kurosawa's 1950 masterwork is a chilling, utterly memorable dissection of the nature of human communication.",
        "Unveiled at the Venice film fest [in August 1951], this caused a flurry in critical circles for its brilliance of conception, technique, acting and its theme of passion.",
        "Much of the power of the picture\u2014and it unquestionably has hypnotic power\u2014derives from the brilliance with which the camera of Director Akira Kurosawa has been used. The photography is excellent and the flow of images is expressive beyond words.",
        "Rashomon has had such a profound cultural influence that there is even a psychosociological phenomenon named after it.",
        "A penetrating study of the subjectivity of truth and perception, changed cinema forever and inspired the phrase \"the Rashomon effect.\"",
        "Kurosawa's international breakthrough is a masterstroke in unreliable narration.",
        "Film is still an impressive piece of work, visually and rhythmically masterful.",
        "The film is still one of the most glorious testaments to the frustrations and exhilarations of chasing an unvarnished truth.",
        "Rashomon is a movie of ideas first and foremost. There is little room for subtext here. Matters of truth and human nature are debated in an anguished, grandiose acting style that can be jarring to contemporary, Western eyes.",
        "This level of mastery is timeless, and although the movie is overly deliberate at times, when it takes off, it really flies."

No Kurasawa film is the sameWhile not my favourite Akira Kurasawa(for not only Japan's greatest director, but one of the finest directors there was) film, like Seven Samurai closely followed by Ran, Rashomon is still a fantastic film. No Kurasawa film is the same without great scenery and cinematography, and Rashomon is no disappointment in that regard. The camera is always moving but never feels like too much due to how subtly composed they (and the editing) are, and the scenery especially the beautifully lit jungle is just as striking, not as epic as Seven Samurai but still making its mark. The music, though I may prefer Ran's score when it comes to scores for Kurasawa's films, is always fitting with the mood and atmosphere of the film, and with its exploration of the relativity of truth the four accounts of the woodland encounter between a bandit and a wealthy couple is written in a compelling and completely credible manner. Kurasawa's direction as ever is superb, as are the performances of Machiko Kyo and Toshiru Mifune. Overall, a truly remarkable film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",
