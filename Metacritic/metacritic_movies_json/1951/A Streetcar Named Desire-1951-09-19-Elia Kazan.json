  "title": "A Streetcar Named Desire",
  "rating": 8.2,
  "release_date": "1951-09-19",
  "summary": "Disturbed Blanche DuBois (Vivien Leigh) moves in with her sister in New Orleans and is tormented by her brutish brother-in-law (Marlon Brando) while her reality crumbles around her.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "You could make a good case that no performance had more influence on modern film acting styles than Brando's work as Stanley Kowalski, Tennessee Williams' rough, smelly, sexually charged hero.",
    "Epic performances in a movie that seethes with atmosphere.",
    "Elia Kazan’s direction is often stagy, and the sets and the arrangement of actors are frequently too transparently “worked out,” but who cares when you’re looking at two of the greatest performances ever put on film and listening to some of the finest dialogue ever written by an American?",
    "The movie Streetcar still seethes with lust, and retains so much of Williams’ florid dialogue and insinuation that it often feels like Kazan and his cast are getting away with something.",
    "Streetcar is always a wonderful screen drama and now, also, a study in film archeology. [Director's Cut]",
    "Elia Kazan and a simply superlative cast have fashioned a motion picture that throbs with passion and poignancy.",
    "Tennessee Williams' exciting Broadway stage play - winner of the Pulitzer Prize and New York Drama Critics award during the 1947-48 season - has been screenplayed into an even more absorbing drama of frustration and stark tragedy.",
    "Brando's performance as Stanley is one of those rare screen legends that are all they're cracked up to be: poetic, fearsome, so deeply felt you can barely take it in. In the hands of other actors, Stanley is like some nightmare feminist critique of maleness: brutish and infantile. Brando is brutish, infantile and full of a pain he can hardly comprehend or express. The monster suffers like a man. [Restored version]",
    "They are also great performances, and Hawks could have taken heart from Kim Hunter's work, which provides superb, understated balance to the famous fireworks of Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh. Kazan's direction is often questionably, distractingly baroque, swelling up the considerable subtlety of the Tennessee Williams play, but if the hothouse style was ever justified, this is the occasion.",
    "A Streetcar Named Desire works itself up into a hurricane of emotional chaos, yet ironically, as these final scenes give in to hysteria, Brando starts dialing down. Depending on your reading, that makes Stanley either remorseful or sinister. Either way, he’s riveting. If Brando is calm at the end of Streetcar, that’s because he’s the center of the storm.",
    "A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE features some of the finest ensemble acting ever offered on the screen, speaking some Williams's most vivid dialogue. Kazan's direction, however, sometimes verges on the pedestrian, as though he's struggling to recreate his Broadway staging in a much more visually demanding medium.",
    "Brando tends to upstage and upend the whole picture in his way.",
    "It is a tale of phenomenal creatives from Williams to Kazan and Brando and Leigh.",
    "Kazan’s direction simmers when it needs to boil, placing all its chips on the battered decor and ethereal lighting, leaving you to wonder what fun Hitchcock or Preminger would have with the sexually pulsating, pressure-cooker backdrop gifted to them in the source material."

A Streetcar Named Desire is a superb film, elevated especially by superb writing and performances. The film does look beautiful, the photography is very skillful especially. Alex North's music is nice and authentic, while the story is always gripping and the direction very good. As I have said already, the script and the acting drive A Streetcar Named Desire. Like with Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, the homosexual references are cut/not as prevalent, but I still cannot deny that the script was superb, dark, witty and tense. The acting is excellent too. Karl Malden is indeed great, but Marlon Brando gives one of his finest performances ever as the brutal Stanley, while Vivian Leigh also excels in a difficult role as Blanche and the pair while together sizzle with sexual tension. All in all, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox",
