  "critic_reviews": [
    "Hepburn doesn’t know whom to trust and neither does the audience, which is what makes this Hitchcock-lite thriller so much fun. The chemistry between the two leads — something surprisingly missing between Depp and Jolie — is electric.",
    "Charade is a finely crafted thriller that has a lot to offer beyond its clever plot. The radiant Hepburn's romance with the suave Grant is delightfully handled; the Oscar-nominated theme song by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer is superb; the location photography is exquisite and the rooftop fight scene between Grant and Kennedy is truly harrowing.",
    "Firsttime teaming of Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, a natural, gives the sophisticated romantic caper an international appeal, plus the selling points of adventure, suspense and suberb comedy.",
    "For all of its 113 minutes, Charade presents us with a temporary entry into that brighter place, into the possibility of adventure, the vicarious possession of beauty. Acted by two Europeans in a mythic, dangerous, beguiling Paris, it remains a quintessential Hollywood film.",
    "Stanley Donen's classy crime caper has charm, wit -- and Cary Grant.",
    "The sexual chemistry between Hepburn and Grant, when set against Charade's tumultuous backdrop of shifting identities, makes this movie an enduring favorite.",
    "A terrifically entertaining comedy-thriller, perfectly crafted by Stanley Donen from an ingenious screenplay by Peter Stone.",
    "Ahead of the pack must be the winning duo of Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, whose performances in director Stanley Donen’s masterpiece Charade is as intoxicating as a dry martini.",
    "This sounds a bit like Hitchcock, but Charade—written by Peter Stone and directed by Stanley Donen—isn’t nearly interested enough in humanity’s dark side to qualify. The movie just wants to have fun.",
    "Shot by Charles Lang, one of the greatest American cinematographers to ever live, Charade is some sort of miraculous entertainment, self-aware and self-parodying yet never distancing or detached. Hepburn is the audience’s funny and flighty proxy, allowing us the great pleasure of being seduced by Grant’s unpredictable charmer.",
    "While hardly as sturdy or provoking an entertainment as North by Northwest, say, it remains an entertainment.",
    "Perhaps the best Hitchcock film Hitchcock never made.",
    "What's going on is sort of confused. Director Stanley Donen (Indiscreet) apparently started out with a sensible idea: with Grant and Hepburn on the payroll and Paris for a setting, why not tell a love story? But somewhere along the production line, he decided to make a thriller instead. Then he turned the thriller into a sophisticated comedy of murders.",
    "There's a lot to be said for it as a fast-moving, urbane entertainment in the comedy-mystery vein."

You're trying to do Hitchcock and Wilder at the same time? In the same movie? With screwball elements added on top? Get real. Remarkably though, \"Charade\" manages fairly well for itself, juggling murder scenes (some of which are pretty graphic for the time, by the way), snappy dialogue passages, and characters goofing off with a noted amount of skill. And, although the final product may not be entirely even all around, it's an absolutely valid effort from a tonal standpoint. Let's not kid ourselves here, however. You came here for the all-star cast, but you're going to stay for the bendy, twisty, and malleable caper narrative in play. I love it when movies get cute with the plot like this. Sure, some of it is predictable, but I'll always feel better when a writer or director feels they have to escalate what they're doing from scene to scene, whether that's with the action, the visuals, or -- in this case -- the plot elements. No character is who they seem to be and the audience's understandings of these characters are constantly pushed, pulled, and poked at, always giving us something to doubt, consider, or simply think about. It's a damn fun time and I'm glad I finally got around to seeing it.",

Charade is the perfect vehicle to enjoy them. It has a fascinating thriller plot, which is presented quite seriously with convincing bad guys, while the stars keep the romance light and funny. It's the Hitchcock movie that he didn't make, but anyone who loves those movies simply must see Charade. There's a noticeable age difference between these blockbuster stars, and I love how it is handled directly with humor. One of my all-time favorite movies.",

Simplement une petite comédie qui mélange les genres et se fout de nous avec ses rebondissements tout droit sortis d’une blague carambar. Ouais, faudrait pas nous prendre pour des canards sauvages non plus, car au énième retournement de situation, on pourrait bien prendre la mouche !Il n’y a donc pas grand-chose qui tienne debout dans cette pantalonnade et son parterre de stars, à part le sémillant Cary Grant et les James Coburn, George Kennedy et Walter Matthau, excusez du peu… Quant à la cruche anorexique (la cruchette endimanchée) aux yeux de Bambi, elle tape carrément sur les nerfs : tais-toi un peu et va plutôt manger un gâteau, histoire de te remplumer un peu.On a tout de même (aussi) la jolie musique d’Henri Mancini et un passage comique -le seul du film- dans lequel on peut constater un jeu apparemment très prisé à l’époque, le jeu de l’orange. C’est quelque chose !Notons tout de même la duplicité très appréciable (si elle n’était aussi surexploitée, la pauvre) de ce bon vieux Cary qui passe d’un registre à l’autre avec une aisance déconcertante. Cela ne sauve pas le film pour autant, ni ce Paris d’antan dans lequel s’éparpille ce scénario abracadabrantesque… et grotesque !",
