  "summary": "The fairytale rise to superstardom of America's favorite \"Idols\" continues as Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini make the leap to the big screen in this spring's biggest beach party, From Justin to Kelly, a musical romantic comedy.  (20th Century Fox)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Relentlessly inoffensive, innocuous and vacuous, From Justin to Kelly is nowhere near as bad as its pre-release publicity would suggest.",
    "Full of gumption, Clarkson and Guarini soldier on, seemingy unaware that the perfectly adequate singing voices that brought them to the big screen are being drowned out, on a half-dozen same-sounding songs, by an overlayered backup group.",
    "The music is lavishly overproduced pop pablum of the first order, and there's a deeply shallow irony in the fact the film's most memorable tune, KC and the Sunshine Band's 28-year-old \"That's the Way I Like It,\" is easily twice the age of its target audience.",
    "They play cotton candy effigies of themselves named Kelly and Justin, and the best that can be said is that they don't embarrass themselves.",
    "The most resounding thuds in From Justin to Kelly, however, come from the musical numbers.",
    "Bury this in the time capsule: a memento of the Clean South, 2003.",
    "A feather-light musical rushed into production to capitalize on American Idol-frenzy, is nothing more than an excuse to give the two leads several musical numbers, a la those Frankie Avalon-Annette Funicello \"Beach Blanket Bingo\" movies, and with just about the same amount of substance, too.",
    "In this frothy beach movie, they make pop-music lite together but create an utterly unconvincing romantic couple, seeming more like siblings or best friends. From Ruben to Clay might work better.",
    "Arguably the most insipid movie released so far this century.",
    "Aspires to be a \"Beach Blanket Bingo\" redux with a gangbang Grease finale, but it plays like junior high Neil LaBute filmed by an elementary school AV squad.",
    "Just one of those films, a bottomless well of snark fodder that may come and go in theatres but will surely be spun innumerable times on DVD at parties in the years to come.",
    "One of the worst movies you'll ever see -- but it's still not worth seeing.",
    "It's like ''Grease: The Next Generation'' acted out by the food-court staff at SeaWorld.",
    "They have the chemistry of step-siblings, so a movie that has them make out is, as the one of the few girls in the theater exclaimed, \"so gross.\"",
    "More than anything, From Justin To Kelly needs Simon Cowell, the fork-tongued Idol judge who gives the show its only sliver of tension.",
    "More than awful, more than dreadful, and easily the worst beach movie ever made."

      "content": "Bill L., I completely agree with your words. I believe that the majority of viewers have missed out on the amazing experience that is this film. The extremely complex plot leaves you constantly guessing what will happen next, and the amazing Bill L., I completely agree with your words. I believe that the majority of viewers have missed out on the amazing experience that is this film. The extremely complex plot leaves you constantly guessing what will happen next, and the amazing script is somehow executed perfectly by the equally amazing acting. Justin Guarini and Kelly Clarkson, despite being newly introduced to the world of the silver screen, are truly amazing as actors. Guarini, who definitely has a future as a great thespian, wove his craft with the poise of Peter O'Toole, the passion of Robert DeNiro, and the cool yet strangely disconcerting eyes of Chistopher Walken. Kelly Clarkson played her role with the absolute grace of Audrey Hepburn, the towering emotion of Meryl Streep, and her performance could even be compared to Ingrid Bergman's in Casablanca. As Bill L. said, there are subtleties in this film that give it great depth. Each time I viewed this masterpiece, I came across something new that I had missed before, leading to some startling realizations that greatly affected my appreciation of the movie. For example, (*warning: plot-revealing spoiler ahead*) I realized during my fifth viewing that Justin Guarini had longer keratinized filamental cranial protrusions than his costar! The implications this bore with the aspect of the movie concerning the asexuality (or even desexuality) of everyone in it and how that contributed to the controversial PG rating absolutely stunned me. Various aspects such as the breath-taking, eye-catching backgrounds perfectly complemented the epic musical scores. I predict a few Oscar nominations and definite wins for this movie. In closing, it could be said that this movie captured the essence of its time and the spirit of the people the same way that Gone With the Wind has, oh so long ago. If you ever watch this movie, I guarantee that you will sincerely be leaving the theater in tears.",

This movie is not meant to be taken seriously, it's just a fun musical, with some corny teen humor.
