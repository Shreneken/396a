    ],
    "summary": "Based on skin-curdling tales of the real life \"flesh eating virus,\" Cabin Fever blends the elements of classic horror films of the 70's and 80's with modern day medical terror.  (Lions Gate Films)",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Gory, scary, smart and funny, this is definitely one of the best horror films I\u2019ve seen in years.",
        "Completely -- and quite cleverly -- contrived, a cascade of stupid mistakes and miscommunication stirred into a visceral stew of gooey blisters and flaying layers of bloody flesh.",
        "While Cabin Fever takes its horror very seriously, it still shows that it has a sense of humor.",
        "Roth never fully exploits the woods around him, and the homes of the locals are far too middle-class, but because so many clich\u00e9s are discarded amid the flesh rot, even the patented \"Night of the Living Dead\" coda feels sharp-edged and genuine.",
        "Sustains such a palpable mood of foreboding until the end.",
        "It plays on your knowledge of/expectations about generic horror movies and then either delivers the goods from an unexpected angle or pulls the rug out from under you.",
        "First-time director Eli Roth turns this cheapie into a greatest-hits of horror. It's a blast of good gory fun that just won't quit.",
        "If this story has a moral -- though unlike many horror films, it doesn't seem to -- it's that humans are likelier to destroy themselves than help each other.",
        "A ferociously entertaining and mean little horror movie that achieves the kind of outrageous vibe best enjoyed in a crowded, noisy theater.",
        "Roth, who has taken more than a few cues from Raimi, David Lynch (whom Roth worked with), and George Romero (Night of the Living Dead), is working in a horror tradition that goes way back -- and he's working it with nasty glee.",
        "So this is a first-level, unironic fright film, the sort whose tongue is removed from its cheek, coated in gore, and pointed right at the audience.",
        "Cabin Fever may not be a horror classic, but it's definitely an ideal midnight movie.",
        "A refreshingly old-fashioned splatter movie.",
        "Ultimately, Cabin Fever isn't going to win any awards for originality - it's too busy twisting the conventions of the genre back in on themselves for that - but it does provide a jarring battery of scares (often depressing ones at that) that make it severed-head-and-shoulders above the spate of recent shockers.",
        "A disciple of David Lynch's, Roth packs his story with horror, humor, hillbillies and sex. Roth caps his fast-moving story with a joke that's as oddly left-field as it is funny, but truth to tell, it is funny.",
        "Other than a few witty jokes and a game cast, there's nothing particularly special here.",
        "While many films of this kind are undermined by amateurish performances, the main cast is solid and some of the supporting performances (many from non-professionals) are small gems.",
        "Roth puts a sardonic spin on the puritanism of the 80s slasher.",
        "A big, dumb, crude, noisy, goose-the-audience bash and proud of it. It's not nearly as unsettling as ''28 Days Later.''",
        "As a thriller, Cabin Fever falls short, filled with characters so obnoxiously stupid that just watching their skin slowly melt off doesn't seem like enough punishment.",
        "Maybe Roth was too busy paying tribute to all his childhood influences to take the necessary steps, but even in this uneasy era of SARS and other airborne horrors, his flesh-eating virus movie never convincingly gets under the skin.",
        "Hypochondriacs and germ freaks may dig it.",
        "It's so by-the-numbers and clumsy that it will only appeal to that little sect that's managed to wear out their \"Evil Dead,\" \"Friday the 13th,\" \"Halloween\" and \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" DVDs.",
        "Doesn't have the gonzo wit of ''Re-Animator'' or ''Evil Dead 2,'' nor is it flat-out terrifying like ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' or even a zombie-come-lately like this year's ''28 Days Later.''",
        "The result is something neither scary nor funny.",
        "The movie adds up to a few good ideas and a lot of bad ones, wandering around in search of an organizing principle.",
        "Uncertain whether to go for straight suspense or gross-out effects, genre in-joking or schlock cinema-of-parodic-excess, Eli Roth's backwoods horror opus Cabin Fever seldom sticks with any one tactic.",
        "Rather than steep his story in dread, ideas or something, anything, fresh and different, first-time director Eli Roth just pours on the blood, along with some recycled surrealism and plenty of giddy movie allusions.",
        "This movie may appeal to the youthful, midnight-madness crowd, but there isn't enough in it to bestow it with classic B-movie glory.",
        "It's just a loud, derivative grade-Z horror film of no particular distinction.",
        "It's just a watery, undeservedly smug update of the low-budget, kids-stranded-in-the-sticks bloodfests of the 1970s and '80s."

I would like to be an atmospheric horror film, but its too cheesy and has too poor acting to pull it off. It degenerates into an uncomfortably funny horror romp, in the vein of Dead Alive/Braindead or Feast.

Imperfect, leaning towards stupid, but still an entertaining entry onto the fringe of Horror.",

If you take this not as a scary movie rather a infection/survival story you will probably be able to enjoy it a bit more. The human lack of compassion element is not even close to believable which really makes the films selling point hard to buy. One of Cabin Fevers saving graces however is one of the funniest ending in recent memory (and I don't mean unintentionally funny). I guess if you like special effects the blood usage in this movie is pretty good but I had a hard time with the movie as I was expecting something completely different than killer tap-water.",

That all kind of got started with this movie. A body-horror about a flesh eating virus infecting a bunch of dumb college kids partying in a cabin in the woods, Cabin Fever slowly ups the dangers that are keeping the characters from getting help. They may have to contend with a savage dog, isolation, and even some gun-toting rednecks, but what really keeps them from getting help for their deadly new skin condition is just their own stupidity. It's hard to take the movie seriously in any regard as the numbskulls manage to muck up every opportunity to save themselves. Luckily, it's clear Roth doesn't really want us to. The movie has a lot of humor to go along with the blood. Some of it dark, most of it dumb.The tongue in cheek style is appreciated as too much gloom and doom to go alongside the gore would have just made for a monotonously dark movie. One I don't think Roth would have been capable of pulling off. No, it was better that he stuck to gross fun and callbacks to some of his favorite horror classics. The influences are clear and the nods are appreciated. Especially since it's a fairly original concept holding it all together instead of just straight up copying. As a result, Cabin Fever is pretty good. A solid, original, and ultimately brainless horror movie. Worth a watch for genre fans even if it's just to see where one of it's more prominent names in modern horror got his start.",

It even manages to be better than many similar films, and we've seen many! Here, the enemy can be everywhere and, ultimately it turns out to be isolation itself. In fact, the title of the film indicates that, given that \"cabin fever\", from the point of view of psychology, is a kind of psychosis that arises in groups of isolated individuals in the same place for too long.The story is simple: five friends go to a forest hut to enjoy themselves after the end of the school year. However, they find there a very sick man with marked red skin. Frightened and fearing that it would be contagious, they try to drive him away but end up killing him. From there, isolated in the middle of nowhere, fear overwhelms them as, one after another, they begin to show signs of the same disease.Although the script is rather weak and predictable, tension and suspense are skillfully built and, ultimately, this makes the film effective in its task. Unfortunately, I agree with the opinion of many expert critics who pointed the finger at the director, Eli Roth, and said that he sometimes did not know if he was trying to scare us or make us laugh. In fact, the film is both scary and cynical and there are some scenes, particularly closer to the end, where the film seems to accentuate its sarcastic streak. For me, the final part was very weak and showed that Roth (who is also partly responsible for the script) did not know how to end his story. The climax is predictable and conventional and the way all characters behave prevents us from wanting anything other than to see them die, and quickly.The cast is sufficiently capable for the characters, which are the usual clich\u00e9s of teen films and do not require effort from the actors. Rider Strong and James DeBello receive two of the strongest and most interesting characters, but the remaining cast hardly deserves a positive note. Joey Kern is highly irritating with so much hypochondria and individualism; Jordan Ladd and Cerina Vincent are there for being sexy at the sex scenes; Giuseppe Andrews is the stupidest cop I've seen in years. The rest is forgettable and does only what it really needs to do.Technically, it is a film that has not particularly caught my attention. Cinematography is good and uses forest scenes and filming locations skillfully. The special effects are limited to corpses, blood and signs of illness in the cast's bodies, but they work well and are truly frightening.",

The movie was creepy and it gave me feelings of Evil Dead.For a debut movie, director did good work. Performance by the cast was okay, not effective. You are unable to connect with them and don't even feel sad for them. The movie was also lacking some good background music that could have helped movie to become more spooky and creepy.Overall, you can give it a try. You may enjoy it especially if you are fan of low budget B grade horror-dark comedy movies.",
