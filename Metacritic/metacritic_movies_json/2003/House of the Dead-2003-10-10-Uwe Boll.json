  "title": "House of the Dead",
  "rating": 1.5,
  "release_date": "2003-10-10",
  "summary": "Based on the best selling video game from Sega, House of the Dead tells the story of a group of college students who go to a rave on a mysterious island and get more than they bargained for when they find themselves stalked by killer zombies and terrifying creatures intent on feasting on the flesh of the living.  (Artisan Entertainment)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Whether this is a good or bad thing depends on just how much 14-year-old boy you've got in ya.",
    "There's scarcely a whiff of originality in the zombie horror picture House of the Dead, but Uwe Boll has directed it with enough energy and style that it adds up to passably mindless if grisly fun.",
    "Director Uwe Boll wholeheartedly embraces the film's concept, and with some fancy editing and a pulsing soundtrack, the effect really is like watching a video game.",
    "Dull and unimaginative.",
    "Unimaginatively recycles all the teens-in-the-woods gorefest conventions.",
    "Somewhere between cartoonishly bad for comic effect and bad because the filmmakers didn't really give a damn, The House of the Dead is, at least, unpretentiously dumb.",
    "House of the Dead, sadly, is so bad it's bad.",
    "Does little more than add another title to the very long list of movies influenced by George Romero's 1968 horror classic, \"Night of the Living Dead.\"",
    "Much poorly choreographed gunplay, many lovingly rendered head explosions, and some half-assed exposition about centuries-old, immortality-seeking pirates follow, with nothing to recommend House Of The Dead to anyone but the most undiscriminating zombie-movie fans.",
    "Here’s a would-be horror film that contains not one ounce of professional pride in its making, not one shred of technical competence. This is one of the worst films of recent times.",
    "Laughable performances.",
    "Prochnow rocks; nothing else does.",
    "Based on a video game, far exceeds expectations -- in negative ways that inspire thoughts of less than zero stars.",
    "To properly convey the jaw-dropping shoddiness of this videogame-based ''horror'' ''movie,'' one must approach what scientists call Absolute Stupid, a state previously thought to exist only under highly controlled laboratory conditions or at the highest levels of government.",
    "It’s cheese of the purest stripe, bafflingly bad to the point of being oddly charming in its brain dead naïveté."

I watched how they shot the undead and how the blood splattered and how numerous body parts were severed which, by the way, was annoyingly unrealistic. The sense of horror a horror-survival movie should inflict on the viewer should be that of horror-survival. The survival element was there, but dilluted, and there was a very vague sense of horror in that the zombies acted like a bunch of mindless morons. An interesting thing that was incorporated into the movie were scenes from the actual House of the Dead video game. This novelty, though a good idea, failed to be the movie's saving grace. In the end we have a complete waste of time and money, and unless you are a die-hard (no pun intended) fan of House of the Dead, and I mean die-hard fan, you should stay as far away as you can from this movie.",

Wow...my opening joke here sucks.Acting/characters: Shallow, generic, and underdeveloped that's all I can say about them. I kept hoping that there would be someone in the whole film who I would think \"maybe this one will be different and kinda likable\" out of the whole cast, no one fit that bill. I can't even remember their names without looking them up with the exception of Kirk. Even as I write this, their names and faces slip from my mind. That is for the best I feel. I just do not care about them whatsoever. Who could? Maybe the 3 or 4 people out there who like this film say 'the characters are so incidental because this is a cheesy action flick and nothing more.' To those 3 or 4 people (including Uwe Boll) I say, if I want this many faceless characters, I'll go play the video game itself. It's a movie so it should have at least one character worth anything. This doesn't. Plus, the character who narrates the film is so dumb. Well, not just him, the whole concept of the character. A narrator is our protagonist. We are seeing the film from his or her eyes. This guy wasn't in the film for the first third of it. Once he was you never got to really know him at all. It's like he was just there and was narrating it in passing later. I dunno maybe the script did have a likable character, well if so, the actors killed it. They all absolutely sucked. I think one of them went on to do something worthwhile after this...how? They were monotonous, blank, and uninteresting. 0/10Plot: I've read the plot to the original game. This one is supposed to be a prequel to that game in a sense...no matter what angle you look at it from the two are not connected plot-wise at all. This would be fine I suppose but Uwe Boll decided to use a plot that has been circulating on the Slasher Genre for decades: Teenagers at a party in an abandoned location are being killed off. So, not only did he not even try to tie it into the actual source material itself, he decided to use an old, over-used plot to do it. Way to go Uwe! You've sunk to a new low. At least I haven't seen the plot to Alone in the dark 50 times in 50 different movies like this one. You didn't even try. You didn't even try. 0/10Screenplay: If I asked Uwe Boll what he thought about the script for this film he would give me a blank stare and say 'the what for my film?' an exaggeration to be sure, but not that much of one. Some lines in there just had my head ringing. Which ones?...all of them...yeah, all of them. I don't know who wrote this screenplay or why but they should be banned from ever making a screenplay again. This comes off like some kid wrote it. No offense to kids. Come on people this is a movie1 You get paid to do this! Now I'm not saying it has to be Casablanca but can you please not try to outdo Troll 2 in terms of stupidity? 0/10Likableness: I add Uwe Boll to my list of directors who love slow-mo too much (move over Michael Bay and Zack Snyder). And he's just friggin' lazy too. There is one shot that he reuses 4 DIFFERENT TIMES!!! I mean come on! Twice is pushing it but 4!?!?! I highly disliked this film and I will probably never watch it again. I would advise everyone who has not seen this to go and watch something better. Like the Garfield movie (oh snap) and leave this alone. It was terrible. I give this one a solid 0/10.Final Score: 0/40Tomatometer rating: 4%Tomatometer rating if my review was added: 4%TRIVIA TIME: 1. The fisherman with the hook (gaff) at the beginning of the movie is a reference to the killer in I Know What You Did Last Summer.2. At the beginning of the movie, Greg says, \"Who's the U-boat captain?\" when he sees Capt. Viktor Kirk. Prochnow was the captain in Das Boot.3. Jonathan Cherry burned 30% of his hand on the second day of shooting. The scene on the bridge, where he hurts his hand, was shot later, to explain the bandage he had to wear.4. Reviews were so bad that Danish cinemas refused to buy it.5. House of the Dead is the last film to use the turn-table technique for 360Â° shots. The risk of actors being hurt or killed by the fast-moving camera was too much.",

This movie is a monument, no doubt of it. Where did it go wrong? Oh yes, adapting a rail-shooter game as a movie. Why did no one instantly react to this idea? Anyway the worst is done. Now let's review it.Overall acting is terrible. Dialogues are one of the dumbest of the whole history of cinema. Women (excepted the cop one) are all here to showcase their breasts (and their bodies in some extent). Scenario is dreadful, unoriginal and predictable. Jokes are unfunny, dull and vulgar. Some scenes are plagiarized from 'Jaws'. Special effects, costumes and make-up are horrible. Overall lighting is a mess. Characters are over-stereotyped. It is impossible to develop any empathy for any of them. Scenes are awfully shot, with way too many cuts and inappropriate flashes of the original game. Sega company takes its enormous bundles of bills in the beginning of the movie when they accepted to show their brand during that truly indecent party. Music and original score are agressive and also inappropriate. I found pace was quite good excepted during fights which all were way too long.Don't get me wrong, despite the 2/10 it is clearly a movie that I will rewatch with pleasure because I certainly missed a lot of its flaw on the first view. I am quite fascinated by this.",
