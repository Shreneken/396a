  "summary": "From master storyteller Jim Sheridan comes a deeply personal and emotionally raw tale of a family finding its soul In America.  Through the wide-open eyes of two young heroines, Sheridan transforms a devastating human tragedy into a riveting, humor-tinged story about memory, secrets, love, loss, coming together and starting over.  (Fox Searchlight)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "It's a wistful yet penetrating film, shot through with magic realism and life-affirming humor, that gets you deep down where you live.",
    "In America is not unsentimental about its new arrivals (the movie has a warm heart and frankly wants to move us), but it is perceptive about the countless ways in which it is hard to be poor and a stranger in a new land.",
    "Has a warmth that’s utterly enchanting, and a tenderness that’s genuinely touching. This is a real gem.",
    "Jim Sheridan's miraculous In America, a generous but never sentimental fable of Irish immigrants in '80s New York, may be the great movie of 2003.",
    "In America is the most unexpected and personal triumph yet from Jim Sheridan.",
    "The miracle of the movie is the Bolger sisters, who are so direct and matter-of-fact that they hardly seem to be acting. But their simplicity is radiant.",
    "The movie's slight, anecdotal structure is deceptive; you wouldn't guess how big an emotional wallop it packs.",
    "It is that rare find: a film that is as emotionally truthful as it is satisfying.",
    "These people and the tale of their migration and reintegration into life’s ebb and flow will remain with the viewer long after Johnny's and Sarah’s green cards expire.",
    "Family life rarely is portrayed with such warmth, clarity and vibrancy as in In America.",
    "Touching, but not cloying, uplifting and hopeful but never sappy and also just plain funny. There is not a false note among the five core performances, nor a false word in Sheridan's script.",
    "Wondrously emotional film, one that sneakily dismantles your defenses and purges grief you didn't realize you had.",
    "It's a fresh-hearted film that only frustrates when you sense how close it is to being exceptional.",
    "It is kept watchable and empathetic by the energy of the superb performances and the sense of complete freshness.",
    "In Sheridan's warm and glowing treatment, the moral of the story feels less like a reheated fable than like something utterly, indescribably original.",
    "The result is a blend of kitchen-sink and magical realism: sentimental, but well acted and freshly observed.",
    "Layered with elements that are both amusing and touching but never threatening to collapse into a big heap of sentimental mush.",
    "The acting is uniformly superb.",
    "Has moments of biting tenderness, yet the movie made me wish that Sheridan had let in more of America.",
    "If you're looking for a bit of an uplift, you could do worse among the gloom of so many holiday dramas.",
    "An emotional wipeout.",
    "When you see a director going for that lump-in-the-throat mood, instinct takes over and you want to dig in your heels. Sometimes it's best just to let yourself be swept away.",
    "In the end, is In America slight in its sentimentality and manipulative in its moral? Sure, but that's the job of any fable or myth.",
    "The script expertly captures kids' behavior.",
    "But there are so many beautiful, tender moments in In America -- that it's easy to forgive Sheridan's manipulative ploys.",
    "Warm and borderline sentimental...also brimming with true and privileged moments, as well as an optimism in the face of tough circumstances that serves as a corrective to some of the more fashionably grim modern accounts of similar stories.",
    "Emma Bolger is -- no other word for it -- magical in the role...In her way she encapsulates In America's virtues. It's a realistic movie, but one that's always aware that transformative hope may be just around the corner.",
    "While In America doesn't convince as an immigrants-in-the-U.S. story, it resonates powerfully as a portrait of grief and reconciliation.",
    "Like a kid playing make-believe, In America is blithely confident of its own contrivances; it only benefits from a certain unselfconscious naïveté. And as with a misjudged Christmas gift or a mawkish sympathy card from a kindly relative, one can hardly doubt its uplifting intentions.",
    "A recklessly emotional film that is so committed to feelings it occasionally overflows its banks. Which may be a little messy, but it's a lot more welcome than the drought-stricken alternatives.",
    "Thanks to Jim Sheridan's graceful, scrupulously sincere direction and the dry intelligence of his cast, In America is likely to pierce the defenses of all but the most dogmatically cynical viewers.",
    "The film is not emotionally subtle, but it is beautifully shot, by cinematographer Declan Quinn, with a grainy, impressionistic eye that mimics a perpetual dance of shards of remembered experience.",
    "Contains enough magic and sincerity to cover the proverbial multitude of cinematic sins. And, better yet, for all the Irishness, it contains not a single alcoholic and not one barroom brawl!",
    "It's hard to dislike a film that wants to say that the bereft have to move on with their lives, that death is part of living, and that poverty is a state of mind. But it's not impossible.",
    "Definitely designed to tug on its audience's heartstrings, a task at which it completely succeeds, In America is ultimately a solid, if unspectacular family film.",
    "Fortunately, there are more than enough moments when the heavy-handedness gives way to the sheer bliss of ordinary magic.",
    "The film is marvelously acted -- the Bolger sisters are a delight -- and Sheridan captures New York City's crazy energy as only an newcomer can.",
    "The story has too many trite moments, but strong acting and a goodhearted attitude keep it afloat.",
    "It has its charms, but fails to strike a similar emotional chord."

Perhaps it was just me, as I have alot on my mind at the moment but I did find that the story was a bit confusing, when the character of MateoI quite enjoyed the movie, although I did feel that, personally, it suffered a bit from confusion. Perhaps it was just me, as I have alot on my mind at the moment but I did find that the story was a bit confusing, when the character of Mateo gives a rather surprising outburst and some of what the daughters said, trying to keep track of who their referring to (the character of Frankie, thats often mentioned during the narration, I found I got confused as to who exactly they meant, though after having checked this after seeing all of the movie, im more clear on this now and it makes a bit more sense).I think that for some, it'll seem a bit slow and probably rather more sad than they might like or expect, possibly, as well as giving slightly confusing messages, as I say. It would have been classified by myself as a rather negative movie, in terms of being full of sadness from whats learnt about the families past but actually it is pretty uplifting too, especially when the character of Mateo is shown his real colours beneath the different surface and this in a way saves the movie, I feel. It would be too depressing, had the ending not been what it was and I suppose for others, maybe they would feel that the ending makes it a bit too Hollywood-ised but I don't, I think, to me, it all happened in a believable way that made me left feeling hopeful and yet still sad but in a reminiscent way for the family. I suppose this won't make a great deal of sense until you watch the movie but perhaps it helps you decide if this is of interest to you(?).All in all, I felt that the movie was somewhat different to what I was expecting, there isn't a great deal of mention about how the family feel about the country and it isn't any kind of a roadtrip movie or exploration of the American culture really either. Its alot more insular and it doesn't have so much of an obvious 'goal' that we wait for the end to see the outcome of, its a movie that plods along and instead as the movie continues, we're given more insights into the family and their background instead. In that way, its not really that fast paced and its not got any real romance elements, though there is a sexual scene, which I also mention under classification.This is a good general movie that is heartwarming and touching, if not rather confusing as well. Its a shame, if it had been done possibly in a different way, it would have got a better rating from me but I do feel like I did still enjoy it, hence my 7 out of 10 rating.",
