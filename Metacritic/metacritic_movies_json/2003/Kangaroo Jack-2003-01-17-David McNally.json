  "title": "Kangaroo Jack",
  "rating": 4.6,
  "release_date": "2003-01-17",
  "summary": "Two friends from Brooklyn are forced to deliver mob money to Australia.  Their misadventures begin when a kangaroo hops off with the cash.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Jumps at chance to be silly.",
    "Highbrow entertainment this isn't.",
    "This salt-and-pepper buddy movie set in the scenic environs of downtown Brooklyn and the Australian bush is a crowd-pleaser -- for the elementary-school set.",
    "Will parents be able to sit through Kangaroo Jack without plunging sharp sticks into their eyes? The short answer? Yes. Barely.",
    "Likable but negligible.",
    "A dumb, by-the-numbers children's movie.",
    "The film's crude humor and violence -- cartoonish, but still violent -- should offend parents of younger kids. Yet its ultra-broad, pratfall-filled comedy will satisfy only the most indiscriminate teens.",
    "This fish-out-of-water buddy/action comedy is aimed squarely at undiscriminating 10-year-olds, and that demographic may well enjoy it.",
    "Run -- don’t walk -- from this film or you might end up watching a bad CGI character do a painful Dr. Evil impression.",
    "The 'roo doesn't talk, except in a dream sequence…I'm dying here.",
    "In the life-is-too-short category, file Kangaroo Jack as a sub-Farrelly Brothers, dumb-plus-dumber buddy picture.",
    "A desert of shrill juvenile jokes and clanging chase sequences.",
    "Lame comedy.",
    "The kangaroo is devoid of charm, as are the actors, who have the chemistry of fingernails on a blackboard.",
    "Hop away from this one fast!",
    "Bruckheimer shifts from high-concept historical romance \"Pearl Harbor\" and high-concept T&A \"Coyote Ugly\" to a first attempt at high-concept light comedy, yet only his fondness for dragging acting talent down with him carries over.",
    "For auds unwilling or unable to grapple with the subtle nuances of \"Scooby Doo,\" Warners now gives us Kangaroo Jack, a shrill and silly farce.",
    "Indeed, the largely computer-generated Jack acts the pants off his co-stars, which can and should be taken with a whole trough full of salt.",
    "Straight from the fiery, churning bowels of high-concept hell comes Kangaroo Jack, Bruckheimer's idea of kid-friendly fare, and some of the longest 90 minutes ever committed to film.",
    "What better to do with such a quiet, majestic landscape than to liven it up with the noise and vulgarity of lowest-common-denominator American pop culture?",
    "Were it not for the involvement of producer Bruckheimer, who has made billions by conning millions into believing they can't live without his celluloid crack, it's doubtful Kangaroo Jack would even exist. As it stands now, the \"movie\" barely exists anyway.",
    "There are two distinctive features to the movie: the mind-numbingly banal plot as one chases another who chases another, and all the offensive material.",
    "88 minutes of desperate gyrations intended to simulate humor.",
    "It's fitting that the kangaroo gives the most lifelike performance.",
    "Virtually every shot of the kangaroo was digitally created, and perhaps that was an insurance policy masterstroke. Forcing a real live one to act opposite these co-stars could have easily constituted animal cruelty."
