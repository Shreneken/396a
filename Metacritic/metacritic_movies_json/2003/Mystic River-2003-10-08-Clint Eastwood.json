  "summary": "As the investigation of the death of a young woman tightens around three old friends, and ominous story unfolds that revolves around friendship, family and innocence lost too soon.  (Warner Bros.)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "To see strong acting like this is exhilarating. In a time of flashy directors who slice and dice their films in a dizzy editing rhythm, it is important to remember that films can look and listen and attentively sympathize with their characters. Directors grow great by subtracting, not adding, and Eastwood does nothing for show, everything for effect.",
    "Mystic River is classic Eastwood, classic noir. If there is still some doubt about whether this one-time macho star is actually a world-class moviemaker, Mystic River should end the argument for good. One of the best American movies of the year, crisply well-crafted and beautifully acted.",
    "A major American motion picture, an overpowering piece of work that involves some of the most basic human emotions: love, hate, fear, revenge, despair. Directed by Clint Eastwood with absolute confidence and remarkable control.",
    "Chilling, superbly acted.",
    "Moves along its course and overflows at its climax with that indefinable but unmistakable assurance of a master filmmaker who knows just what he wants to say, is in total command of his medium and is in no mood to make any compromises.",
    "This kind of quiet ambiguity, avoiding easy answers to complex human conflicts, is all too rare in American movies.",
    "Eastwood's elegantly directed Mystic River, a deeply textured drama in which the sins (or perceived sins) of the past weigh heavily on the present.",
    "Perhaps the greatest, most affecting articulation of the theme Eastwood has been exploring since 1990's \"White Hunter Black Heart\": how violence--real violence, not movie violence--perpetrated and experienced, can erode and/or obliterate the human soul.",
    "The performances are uniformly remarkable.",
    "Eastwood has crafted one of the most powerful American dramas in years.",
    "Eastwood directs Mystic River with an invigorated grace and gravitas. This is a true American beauty of a movie, a tale of men and their bonds told by and for adults who value the old-fashioned Hollywood-studio notion of narrative.",
    "Mystic River is the rare American movie that aspires to -- and achieves -- the full weight and darkness of tragedy.",
    "Clint Eastwood pours everything he knows about directing into Mystic River. His film sneaks up, messes with your head and then floors you. You can't shake it. It's that haunting, that hypnotic.",
    "A haunted thriller of disturbing power.",
    "Mystic River is hard-boiled beyond toughness: It's so tender the skin falls away from the bone. It's Eastwood's most soulful, and most organic, movie.",
    "If Mystic River is just a bit overplayed, a tad too highly pitched, it still resonates with grief and fury and feeling.",
    "This full-bodied adaptation of Dennis Lehane's involved and involving 2001 bestselling crime novel about old friends in Boston's working-class Irish neighborhood finds Clint Eastwood near the top of his directorial game with a cast of first-rate actors.",
    "Sean Penn is so frighteningly good in this movie that he outdoes even the best of his earlier work.",
    "In his best film since \"Unforgiven,\" Eastwood ultimately lets observations on character, community, and the tidal patterns of tragedy shoulder a burden an ordinary murder mystery never could.",
    "Mystic River asks plenty of questions but rarely if ever offers any answers, and certainly no easy ones. If this fine and sorrowful film is what can be expected from our aging cinema icons, here’s to the golden years, dark though they may be.",
    "So incrementally does Eastwood's film build toward what seems like an inevitable resolution that when it concludes, you're sucker-punched. You haven't been watching a police procedural, but a Greek tragedy. You haven't been watching a drama about the catharsis of vigilantism, but sitting vigil for a community diminished, and permanently damaged, by violence.",
    "Deals with themes Eastwood has often explored before, but never so delicately or with as much sad wisdom: The way in which our past haunts our present, the lasting repercussions of violence and the cruel inexorability of fate.",
    "The white-knuckle center of the movie is Sean Penn, who gives an utterly raw performance as Jimmy, father of the dead girl. It's one of the few times that a parent's grief has felt real on the screen through all its ugly permutations.",
    "River ranks with the best movies Eastwood has directed: \"The Outlaw Josey Wales,\"  \"Unforgiven\" and \"The Bridges of Madison County.\" But this time, the work is strong without his own on-screen presence -- a significant achievement.",
    "This is a powerful tale of crime, guilt, and punishment -- a drama that incorporates elements of whodunit mystery/thrillers and police procedurals with a richly textured three-character play.",
    "For all its missteps, Mystic River gets the big things right: It turns you inside out with grief, and it builds to an act of vigilante murder that is nearly impossible to endure.",
    "Echoes Eastwood’s previous exploration of true-life violence, “Unforgiven,” by tracing how death and depravity stain one’s life for generations, leaving seeds to take root in each branch of a tainted family tree.",
    "Two things make Eastwood's task easier for him: a superb cast and a cracking source novel. Dennis Lehane's book is one of the very best thrillers of recent years, richer in Boston detail and closer in character study than anything Eastwood manages to bring to the screen.",
    "This is at bottom a pulp thriller that strains -- sometimes pretentiously, at other times with gutter magnificence -- to reach the level of basic human truths.",
    "The acting throughout is exceptional, rooted in observed realism, but suggestive of more mythical agents at work through the lives of human beings.",
    "The grandest presence here is Eastwood. His directing, like his acting, is minimal: unhurried, spare, unforced, rather somber.",
    "One of those rare recent films whose emotional power resonates long after you've left the theater.",
    "Where Lehane's novel seethes with emotionally charged subtext, Eastwood's workmanlike direction feels static -- fatally tasteful, embalmed in gravitas -- while his sporadic efforts at dramatic heightening come off as vulgar cliché.",
    "If he were a more subtle director, it would be a great film; as it is, it's an extremely good one, anchored by the subtly devastating performances of Penn, Robbins and Bacon. The supporting cast is equally good, and blue collar Boston's mean streets take on a beaten-down life of their own.",
    "Arguably Eastwood's most ambitious film since his multi-Oscar winner, \"Unforgiven.\" But it lacks the power and depth of that film's dynamic script by David Webb Peoples.",
    "An urban crime thriller of considerable gravitas.",
    "Little more than the distended first half of a twisty, dark \"Law & Order\" script.",
    "The performances, especially of Penn and Robbins, are so powerful and detailed (down to the Boston accents) that they often persuade one to overlook the narrative contrivances (particularly the incessant crosscutting), the arty trimmings (including Eastwood's own score), and the dubious social philosophy.",
    "Mystic River wants to be a Bruce Springsteen-like anthem of life and death in blue-collar America. It's no more than a doggerel rendition of poetic injustice.",
    "The new bad movie from Clint Eastwood which takes Dennis Lehane's best-selling thriller and turns it into an inert mess that clocks in at 137 minutes but feels like 137 hours."

You're always interested about what's going to happen next, and that's mostly because of the excellent characters and how the film makes us really care for them, which is made easier by the fact that everyone in the cast is incredible.Tim Robbins in particular is absolutely increible.

Can anyone explain to me how this film did any of the above? A trailer that seemed to hint that Tim Robbins's character would track down his molesters with the aid of friends he hadn't seen in years, a plot that my wife and I figured out at the halfway point, and enough dead-end/pointless plot devices to fill Boston Harbor.

And don't blather to me about the \"powerful acting.\" The best performances in this movie--the fine, quiet work done by Kevin Bacon, Laura Linney, and Laurence Fishburne--were, of course, the least acclaimed. All the praise and Oscars went to the overdone hamming of Penn, Robbins, and Marcia Gay Harden (who, to be fair, was given nothing to play but scaredy-cat.) It was embarrassing seeing the great Ms. Linney trying to make that bogus Lady Macbeth scene at the end believable. One of those movies that's trying to impress you rather than tell a story, which you're supposed to learn a lesson from. \"Life sucks\" is not an original message, nor one that will come as a great surprise to many people, but overpraised hack directors always seem to think they're doing something daring by trotting it out.",

Terrible events always seem to bring these three friends together and I felt like I had been punched in the face when it had finished. Sean Penn brings this energy that feels like the most powerful energy a man can emit. Tim Robbins made me feel so bad for the character of Dave. He did a great job of portraying the mentally deteriorated rape victim. Dave was the character that made me feel so sad. He is like the ultimate hero and ultimate victim of this whole movie. Jimmy's daughter may have been the one that was killed, but Dave was raped as a child, kills a pedophile in the act of molestation, is blamed for the murder of the daughter and is then killed by one of his childhood friends in an act of vengeance. I don't care how big of a stupid loose cannon Jimmy is. I felt like the death of his daughter was almost an excuse to get back into his old ways. I wish that Jimmy could get what was coming to him. Losing a loved one is painful, but this character has no excuse for murder. His accusations were purely based on blinding vengeance. I'm sure that several fathers would kill their daughters murderer which makes me feel like my incredible dislike for Jimmy is a little harsh. Look at this ramble! Eastwood just made me feel for his characters and got me emotionally indulged in his film. Such an accomplishment of acting by every character involved in this movie. Acted to perfection, directed to perfection and written to perfection, Mystic River touches on several issues of lost childhoods, loss and our relationships with others. I can't even think of better things to say about this movie, it was so good. Absolutely incredible film.",

What this one did really well is instill the dark mood as loss in many different ways acts like a fog that covers the entire film. Overall, the story is really interesting. On the surface, it is simply a crime thriller where they try to find out who did it and what not, but it is also a representation of human suffering and tragedy. In many ways, it shows how these three troubled boys are not unscathed by the things that have happened to them and how all of them have suffered and will suffer profound losses that consume them entirely. I think the script by Brian Helgeland was fantastic and the direction from Clint Eastwood was really good as well. However, the real star is Sean Penn. I thought Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon were pretty good in their roles here, but Sean Penn stole the entire show. His performance was absolutely marvelous and he really drew you into him, which makes his role in the film all the more believable. It is not surprise that he won for Best Actor.\r In terms of complaints, I see a lot of user reviews calling this one boring and slow, ham-handed, pretentious, and predictable. The only one I can sort of agree with is predictable, though I did not figure it out until the people in the film did (well, part of it, I figured out one part of it early on, but I think we were supposed to). Plus, I do not have a problem with predictability. In addition, this one was anything but boring. It is slow, yes, but it was a perfect showcase of acting and script-driven film. The intensity and sadness of this one were also top-notch and really helped quell any boredom that may set in. As for it being ham-handed or pretentious, no. I honestly do not understand that criticism at all. At no point did I ever find it to be either of those things. It tries to tackle bigger purposes, yes, but that does not mean it is pretentious, especially when it covers it well.",

All of the characters, in their own way, do bad things. Some are worse than others, yes, but there is no one who you want to \"win,\" because this is a movie where no one wins. The ending is terribly sad, and you walk out of the movie so shocked and dismayed at what happened, because even if you don't root for anyone, you still care so deeply about the characters. You still want the best for them, even if you can't root for them, if you can't stand beside them and say \"I stand for the same ideals that this person stand for.\" You want to know who killed Katie, and you don't want it to be Dave, but do you root for Dave to win? Do you root against whoever you think killed Katie? No. This is an incredibly difficult film to watch, and it will not make you smile. It will make your heart sink, and your eyes tear up. It is so very powerful, and delivers such a strong message, it remains impossible not to watch. The acting is phenomenal, and while both Penn and Robbins won Oscars, the show is stolen by Robbins, who turns in one of the best supporting performances I've ever seen (on par with something out of the Godfather). From the opening scene, with those 3 boys playing hockey in the street, until the closing credits, it is relentless. But it is phenomenal.",

Clint Eastwood; as expected, has brilliantly executed the script and holds on to his part of the work with the help of amazing cinematography and fine editing. Sean Penn is achingly good in his portrayal of a troubled parent and is supported by a great cast like Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon and Lawrence Fishburne.

The truth, unfortunately, is that it seems difficult to maintain these friendships for so many years. As we change, asThere are childhood friends who are inseparable and whose friendship lasts a lifetime, but I think they are exceptions. The truth, unfortunately, is that it seems difficult to maintain these friendships for so many years. As we change, as life changes us, we create and build facets of our personality that may, or may not, match well with our friends. Thus, the friends end up moving away because they don't understand each other like they used to. In addition, each one's own life course moves people away and closer, and the friends that childhood brought us will probably follow their lives away from us. I myself, thinking about my childhood, remember nostalgically the faces of those friends that I never saw again, and who followed their lives along paths that separated us. I can only hope, and wish, that they are well, wherever life has taken them.The story follows the lives of three Boston kids named Dave, Jimmy and Sean. Their lives are marked by a day when Dave is kidnapped and subjected to horrific sexual abuses. Years later, Jimmy's eldest daughter turns up dead, after a few hours missing. The investigation, led by Sean, who became a policeman, will focus precisely on Dave, who maintains a suspicious attitude and seems to have something to hide. But Sean must hurry to find out the truth, as Jimmy is determined to take matters into his own hands.This film talks about how life separates friendships, about how small moments can be decisive. Simple things, like getting into a car we never should have, or waiting a day before taking action. Clint Eastwood's meticulous direction combines perfectly with Helgeland and Lehane's impeccable script for a film that is truly memorable. It is a film with difficult themes, which make us think. The theme of friendship, of the way life shapes and changes us, is for me the center of the film, although it passes discreetly under another theme, which is that of sexual abuse perpetrated by pedophiles. It's a film made during the pedophilia scandal that shook Boston and its Catholic community, so it was a very current topic at the time (still is, let's face it).The film has a luxury cast, which is fully committed to work. Sean Penn does an impeccable job, perhaps one of his best works, having rightly deserved the Oscar for Best Actor, which he got with this performance. Equally impressive, Tim Robbins could hardly have done better, also earning the highest award in the film industry. Kevin Bacon presents himself in a much more restrained and discreet register, but equally powerful and effective. Also noteworthy is the impeccable work of Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney, and the excellent help of Lawrence Fishburne.Personally, I think Eastwood's films aren't the most remarkable in the most technical aspects. He is a director who knows how to privilege the story told, the work of the actors, the building of atmosphere, suspense and tension. However, being meticulous as he is, we must be aware of the effective way he uses cinematography and camera work to create tension: that scene where Dave is taken away and sees his friends left behind is simply anthology-worthy, and we don't need more words to understand what will follow in the life of that innocent character. Also the editing and mixing was done impeccably. Finally, a word for the soundtrack, which does not stand out or stay in the ear, but is perfect in the effort to create and work on suspense and dramatic tension.",
