  "critic_reviews": [
    "The Last Samurai is much more fun than a mere history lesson.",
    "A movie that demands our surrender -- to its energy, to its bold-stroke moviemaking, to its acting (particularly by Cruise and Watanabe, who blend musing and graceful muscularity) and, above all, to its romantic vision of a lost world.",
    "Beautifully designed, intelligently written, acted with conviction, it's an uncommonly thoughtful epic. Its power is compromised only by an ending that sheepishly backs away from what the film is really about.",
    "A rousing tale that combines high adventure with emotional effectiveness. This movie works because it never loses sight of the characters no matter how epic the scope becomes.",
    "In his first role since turning 40, Cruise displays a likable new maturity, and an unexpected willingness to look weak and foolish.",
    "Hugely satisfying entertainment that will attract a broad spectrum of audiences around the world. Zwick fully exploits the star power at his disposal, pairing off Cruise and Japanese star Ken Watanabe as two larger-than-life warriors.",
    "Even if you think Cruise has never had a moment of doubt in his life, he makes Nathan's self-loathing palpable, and the character's regeneration has a hoarse, cautious purposefulness that's striking.",
    "A handsome epic, a brave-hearted 19th-century man-saga from the director who made the period piece man-sagas ''Glory'' and ''Legends of the Fall.''",
    "May fall short of its great model, \"Seven Samurai\" (almost all action movies do), but it's miles ahead of most of the gadget-ridden adventure epics around now.",
    "An almost perfect example of mainstream Hollywood filmmaking at its most expensive, well-calculated and safe: opulent production values, solid acting from its name star, distinguished performances from people surrounding him, Big Themes concerning sacrifice and honor, and a ridiculous finale full of superhuman achievements.",
    "Cruise's undeniable star voltage makes it all palatable, and the film is gorgeous to behold and even to listen to, from the rolling green hills to the galloping horses to the \"Lohengrin\"-like theme music on the sound track.",
    "Cruise holds the center of the film with a sharply focused performance, though his bonding with the wise samurai chieftain (Ken Watanabe) is noticeably more ardent than his soggy romance with the stoic wife of a man he killed in combat.",
    "Taken on the level of spectacle rather than of sense, The Last Samurai affords the sort of fizzy enjoyment that can come with epic movie endeavors, including a meticulously detailed world unlike our own, an excellent supporting cast and some pulse-pounding fights.",
    "Though serious, well-crafted and handsome, lacks most of the pungency of the epitome of the genre, \"Lawrence of Arabia.\"",
    "What is not debatable, however, is that Cruise is an actor of limited emotional resources, one who lacks the presence required for the film’s protagonist, a character intended to inhabit more than one dimension.",
    "Grandly overblown and deeply cornball.",
    "Depends on how you're feeling about Tom Cruise--as opposed to the character he's putatively playing.",
    "It's not just Hollywood convention that gets in the way of the story, it's the lack of depth, heft and heart at its core.",
    "Cruise isn't horribly miscast, a la Tony Curtis in \"The Son of Ali Baba\" or John Wayne as Genghis Khan in \"The Conqueror,\" but he doesn't miss by far.",
    "Director Edward Zwick has an ace up his sleeve, in addition to all the glorious scenery and pulse-pounding battles, and that’s Ken Watanabe.",
    "All its themes are laid out like index cards on a screenwriter's bulletin board, and each plot turn seems so inevitable that you'll think you saw this movie in a previous life. (You did.)",
    "The Last Samurai is an idyll in which the savageries of existence are transcended by spiritual devotion. That’s a beautiful dream, and it gives the film a deep pleasingness, but the fullness of life and its blackest ambiguities are sacrificed.",
    "The only history that bears a real influence on The Last Samurai is the history of Hollywood moviemaking, and the unfortunate way it has of turning extraordinary stories into hopelessly ordinary ones.",
    "Most watchable during the majestic brutality of the battle sequences. This is not only because of the handsome staging, but also because the keywords sacrifice and honor are evoked with verve and simplicity, more so than in the \"exchange of idea\" chats between Algren and Katsumoto, which sound like statements being read into the Congressional Record by Nathaniel Hawthorne.",
    "Unwilling to offend, Zwick whitewashes a culture in which brutality and contemplative beauty were inextricably intertwined and, afraid to alienate audiences, he shies away from the story's logical downbeat conclusion, replacing it with an \"ambiguous\" ending that recalls, of all things, \"The Road Warrior.\"",
    "In The Last Samurai, the body count is almost as high as the dead-brain-cell count.",
    "There are pleasures to be had in the handsome, heroic The Last Samurai.  But they' all on the surface.",
    "When the script, by Zwick, Marshall Herskovitz and John Logan, doesn't sabotage the images, and the great cinematographer John Toll turns action into poetry, The Last Samurai emerges as a haunting silent movie.",
    "Patently intended to be a serious exploration of a cultural encounter, but this intent withers through a lack of writers' gravity and a mass of action clichés.",
    "As rich in period and historical background as it is deficient in fresh dramatic and thematic ideas.",
    "What it lacks is artistry, those small touches of personality that might have distinguished its lugubrious history lesson from a bunch of pretty pictures with captions telling the story.",
    "This is a Tom Cruise vehicle, pure and simple, and that means it's destined to be the biggest chunk of guilty white-boy wish fulfillment since Kevin Costner got down with the Sioux in \"Dances With Wolves.\"  In fact, the parallels are all but plagiaristic.",
    "Worst of all, nothing happens that we don't see coming. Nothing. If, as Nathan seems to believe, surprise is a crucial element in any campaign, then The Last Samurai might win a battle or two for your attention but is doomed to lose the Oscar war.",
    "Less a heart-stirring historical study than a nostalgic fantasy, built on a foundation no firmer than Cruise's superstar persona.",
    "Never recovers from its failure to grip or engage in the early going.",
    "A crock - a pandering epic that's as phony as it is condescending.",
    "Watanabe's charismatic performance and a couple of colorful minor characters aside, The Last Samurai has little to recommend it.",
    "There's some cool sword-fighting. But still, it's junk.",
    "The least one can say for this costume action flick is that it hits bottom immediately.",
    "Despite its intelligent agenda, swollen heart and fabulously epic surface, amounts to a didactic banality: a white guy's politically correct lesson abroad.",
    "Cruise pedals hard through The Last Samurai, and the exertion shows. In fact, the whole picture is belabored and lumbering."

It had the ability to be both profound and silly, uplifting and devestating and it could affect me in the way it toyed with my emotions. TheThe Last Samurai reminds me of the kind of poetry I used to read in school, well the good poetry. It had the ability to be both profound and silly, uplifting and devestating and it could affect me in the way it toyed with my emotions. The Last Samurai does exactly that as it juxtaposes the blissful serenity of  pre industrial Japan with the horror and devestation brought by the more technologically advanced Americans. The fact that the film follows the viewpoint of an American as he learns the customs of not just the Japanese but the Samurai allows the film to slowly convince the viewer of the beauty of a simple yet disciplined life. The film follows Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) an American captain charged with training the Japanese army to fight like the more advanced (at least tactically) American forces he belongs to. However Algren is a conflicted character as he is serving a master he loathes (the US army) and because he cannot bring himself to leave, that loathing is only aimed at himself. He has deep regret for his actions as a soldier but also extreme hatred of his superiors and almost everyone around him. Cruise provides one of his best performances as he manages to provide subtle nuances to a character that is already richly written. The film follows Algren though his training of the Japanese army but also his capture and imprisonment by the Samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Watanabe is the perfect foil for Cruise whose performance is energetic but emotional in comparison to Watanabe who is subdued yet engrossing. Their interaction make the movie as they are written in a way that doesn't preach about why the the Samurai way is much more respectable than that of the ever changing Japan but meerly implies it. The slow establishment of a deep and meaningful friendship (Bromance?) between the two is where the heart and soul of the film lies. Director Edward Zwick sets the right pace for the film as it takes the time to display the beauty of Japan and what the Samurai are trying to hold onto but it also progresses the story at an acceptable tempo so that the viewer doesn't lose interest. The film has a great supporting cast although Billy Connolly seemed a little out of place. Overall the film has a power and emotion unlike many films as it takes its inspiration not just from history but also from nature and the beauty in it. It's a film entirely about redemption and I can think of no better place to do it than the Japanese mountains. Nathan Algren is a lucky man.",

I thought the performances were pretty decent and indeed I was somewhat surprised to discover Tim Spall playing Simon Graham and also Billy Connolly as Zebulon Gant - an eclectic cast for for a film set in such a foreign land, I imagine you'd agree?.There are some cheesy/cliched aspects to it, no doubt. A number of times Cruise is shown with the typical pensive/deep in thought type look on his face, that or/and the determined expression shows up a lot, which I felt to be a little cliched, or certainly cheesy to say the least.Also, a young child is shown talking to Nathan a number of times - I imagine many a girl/woman/lady thinking they look cute together but I question the credibility/feasibility, of him being able to speak the local mother tongue/dialect fluently for one thing. I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise, I think its fair to say! still, that and the issues I've raised aside, I will say that the fight sequences are well filmed, with some good martial arts based fighting shown, good choreography and well shot battle scenes. I liked that there is a context shown for these fights/battles, rather than it being one long war/battle film and little else. It did feel somewhat more substantial than, I suppose, I'd expected it to be. Overall it is quite good I'd say, even if your not especially keen on Tom Cruise.",

I didn't start from the beginning but I got hooked when I watched it further. The battles in the movie are a gem to watch especially with Hans Zimmer's talents mixed in with them. The last battle with the machine guns almost made my eyes water it was that powerful. Even though it's not historically correct (in other words this is historical fiction) the characters are compelling to watch and the development between Nathan(Cruise) and Katsumoto(Watanabe) are interesting to watch in some ways, and usually when it comes down to movies involving prejudice it does get really old and repetitive pretty quickly but what I haven't seen in movies is the prejudice of beliefs. The conflict to save the old ways of the samurai from the rise of the next century is something we don't usually see in films now a days. It's actually a pretty descent type of prejudice we should see more in movies, battles for beliefs. This movie is also fun to watch because of the samurai culture it shows, made me feel more intrigued to learn more about Japanese culture now.\rBut I digress. So how does the movie turn out? Well I can see why its not the most well known movie (I blame the trailer for that much) but to me this movie is on my favorites list when it comes down to good story telling, an interesting look on old fashioned Japan, the music is beautiful even though at times I do here some of the Pirates of the Caribbean score a little bit, and gives some solid performances and exciting battle scenes. What else can I say but good movie.\rThe final verdict for this movie to me is 4 katanas/5 and for the site I give it an 8.",

I do not understand how critics could give this film such a bad review, the movie is clearly story driven with the plot not being entirely historically accurate. Most critics probably see the box with Cruise as a samurai and just pass it off as him being some random samurai American and tossing it to one side.\r The Last Samurai is very much focused on Katsumoto, one of the last great rebels against the newly modernized ways of Japan, intent on fighting for the emperor and protecting him from such change. Zwick delivers a brilliant story which is paced well across the duration of the film giving the audience a chance to view the conflict from both sides.\r Personally this is one of my favourite films of all time and I say that without really needing to doubt it, any film that sucks you in from the start and provokes and emotional response surely must be doing it's job correctly.",

If you hear that this is an epic action film about samurais with Tom Cruise, you could probably take a very solid guess about what will happen and how it will happen. However, in spite of that, The Last Samurai never fails to entertain for many reasons. For one, director Edward Zwick is underappreciated massively by critics, as he honestly has a ton of talent, especially when it comes to directing films of this type that revolve around their battle sequences. The battle sequences are brilliantly directed, filmed, and choreographed. In addition, the costume design is great and entirely authentic. The interactions between the Emperor, Cruise, and the Samurai, are also all entirely endearing and moving. Tom Cruise and, especially, Ken Watanabe are also fantastic here and truly command the screen. They have great chemistry and really work well together when they share the screen. Finally, it never overdoes it with the action. While this is an action-packed film, it is just as much as about the characters it portrays and the historical elements it tries to factor in as it is about the action. Overall, The Last Samurai is an entertaining love letter to the days where the Samurai reigned supreme in Japan and is a winner in my books.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nA clash of changing cultures.This film is set in the late nineteenth century and tells the journey of Nathan Algren, a veteran of the wars against the Native American Indians, to Japan, where he will collaborate in the training of the armies of the Emperor who want to modernize his army in Western patterns. But he will eventually know his opponent, the samurai leader Katsumoto, whom Algren begins to wonder.The opening of the Eastern countries to the West was not easy. China and Japan were two imperial countries with ancient cultures and a special attachment to their traditions, so regarded Westerners with some disdain. What they haven't: advanced military technology. Using the \"diplomacy of the cannon\" and the Opium Wars, the two countries were coerced to trade with western countries (curiously, they already did it, with Portuguese and Dutch, since the seventeenth century, but they refused to open totally to the outside world). When they did it there was a great clash of cultures: if some were displeased, other loved the westerners. This was the case of Emperor Meiji of Japan and this is the historical context in which the film is set.Directed by Edward Zwick (who got here one of the biggest hits of his career to date), the movie features Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe in lead roles (Algren and Katsumoto, respectively). The two main actors, like the rest of the cast, we can only speak well. Cruise and Watanabe got on well and this was reflected in the way they interact each other. The way both embody the characters was also excellent and we must notice that we're talking about characters with a strong psychological and dramatic load. Katsumoto is an embittered man, considered a traitor by those who only wish to serve in the best way and aware that day will come that he will die without knowing if will be understood. Algren is a man who lives haunted by his own military past, feeling that made mistakes and helped an unjust war against innocent people. Only in Japan he will recover from this depressed state thanks to the bravery and nobility of the samurai. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is iconic. The visual and special effects, particularly in combat scenes, are beyond reproach. The costumes were made with all the details and the traditional samurai armor are worthy of special note.For all these positive aspects this film was acclaimed by critics and a successful box office, receiving four nominations for the Oscar (supporting actor, art direction, costume design and sound mixing) and three for the Golden Globes (best dramatic actor, best dramatic supporting actor, best original soundtrack). Its a film that deserves to be seen by all who appreciate the oriental culture, the history or just want to see a good movie.",

The Last Samurai is exquisitely shot, with stunning locations, wonderful cinematography and well designed costumes. The music by the ever reliable Hans Zimmer is gorgeous, dramatic in the battle sequences, and poignant in the slower scenes. Speaking of the battle sequences they were extremely well staged and came across as spine tingling. The story is strong, and the performances and direction are too. I have never really liked Tom Cruise, but here he gives one of his better performances ever in this film, sometimes I forgot that it was him acting. Billy Connelly also handles his role well, though I usually associate him with comedy. However, it is indeed Ken Watanabe who captivates, and easily walks away with the acting honours. The script is well crafted, and while the Last Samurai is sometimes overly idealistic and a tad stereotypical, me and my brother cannot help deny this is a superbly shot and well performed film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

This film does have very captivating scenery and the movie is beautifully shot in many places.The polite poetic words of the Japanese characters is very much contrasted with things like a leader guting himself in shame before decapitation,oof. Or the execution of the fallen and defeated on the battlefield, because living in defeat is a big no, no for the Saumria, ouch.Just thinking about it for one minute this is brutal film about the extremes of duty, honor and respect. In an outmoded and dated way of life and on and off the battlefield. This film is an interesting watch which I revisted many times, but I am not rooting for any of the sides. Where this movie feel hits me in the feels is the folly of the human condition to be led to war by the weak, the greedy, the zealots.Where this movie did not really work for me was that family relationship that the Captain had. It was just really plain odd considering what did to whom, but the explaination of it all is that each man did his duty, Again a viewpoint which would be very much of it's time, but kind of creepy for this day and age.

I have never liked sword fighting. Maybe, I don't get it. But I certainly do not agree to the rhythm of it. To a degree that I might even be hostile to the idea. To me, it is baffling to even suggest it. BUT. Then comes the director Edward Zwick. His picturization of that side (I am saying \"that\" for I never connected with the sword fighting) of the action with a perspective from our version of the war, the one we know, which could be the key to understand the romance between two sword fighters. And I am not saying that every decision in the film is correct.And I am not even remotely touching to the storyline or the emotions that is claimed as the influence to all the \"cling-clang!\" noises. Let's just stick to the action itself. The only weak point that I think was the slow motion shots. I didn't find it necessary to slow down these brilliantly choreographed, dangerously performed and sharply edited action scenes. Its rapid and short nature is what made its threats and promises and myths to be supremely fearful.With a zap an arrow hits and a swoosh the sword swings by, and in no time your perception changes about the film. What kind of a film? How its nature is going to be? And where will this bloodshed of a war going to end? Another advantage and my brother would argue the only advantage is Tom Cruise. He brings in authenticity, practical filmmaking and entirely new experience of thrill in your head when you keep the fact in mind, that he learned all those things, he did all those things and they pulled it off in this big a scale.

As a documentary, so to speak; you can see what they have been telling us all along. You see the globalist parasite bankers that control the government trying to do what they do best - destroy the way of life of the Japanese people. They've been doing this for AT LEAST 3 centuries, but I'm sure it's much longer. The oppression, the demonizing of the old ways. It seems like this has been going on much longer than anyone cares about because it's been happening right in front of our eyes the last....70 years since WW2. They infiltrated the Japanese government to the point that the emporer couldn't even stand up to them until he was shown that he needed to be courageous. Our government has been infiltrated for a LONG time... I've never been a huge Tom Cruise fan & I'm definitely not a fan of anyone in Hollywood these days with their communist political garbage and the vaccine BS their controllers FORCE them to push as well as the things they all seem to be involved in; another topic for another time.Anyone who knows what's really going on in the world; I highly recommend watching this movie again because you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. This movie has alot of a very important messages that we ALL need to learn from.",

It's terrifying when his military commander approaches him and Cruise offers to assassinate him for free. Freaky moment when Cruise demonstrates how to scalp someone to the translator. However, these are only a few scenes. Cruise isn't horrible during the rest of the film; it's just that outside of those three scenes, he doesn't have many lines that are really noteworthy. In addition, around the halfway point, you're probably thinking, \"Oh no, not another dull Hollywood plot,\" which is of course the case.",
