  "critic_reviews": [
    "The film's unhurried pace will target it for discerning audiences only, but its wry humor and coolly amused observation of contemporary Japan should score with smart urbanites.",
    "Their (Murray/Johansson) brief, wondrous encounter is the soul of this subtle, funny, melancholy film.",
    "What's astonishing about Sofia Coppola's enthralling new movie is the precision, maturity, and originality with which the confident young writer-director communicates so clearly in a cinematic language all her own.",
    "Fraught with a deep sadness and sense of yearning. Yet, it is also an enormously -- at times, even uproariously -- comedic film, not because it feels any obligation to be \"funny\" in some contrived, screenwriterly sort of way, but because Coppola has set out to make a movie set to the rhythms of real (rather than reel) life.",
    "The fact that this kind of serious material ends up playing puckishly funny as well as poignant is a tribute both to Coppola and to her do-or-die decision to cast Murray in the lead role.",
    "Simply put, Sofia Copolla's Lost in Translation is an amazing motion picture.",
    "This is one of the year's most subtly moving films, and a strong affirmation of Coppola's substantial talent.",
    "Isn't about a May-December romance or a brief encounter in a faraway place. It's about being alone in a crowd and the power of unexpected friendships.",
    "I loved this movie. I loved the way Coppola and her actors negotiated the hazards of romance and comedy, taking what little they needed and depending for the rest on the truth of the characters.",
    "Thanks to two delightful performers, you're drawn powerfully to the outcome.",
    "It's impossible to conceive of this ruefully funny entertainment without Bill Murray, who is nothing less than brilliant.",
    "Here he (Murray) supplies the kind of performance that seems so fully realized and effortless that it can easily be mistaken for not acting at all.",
    "The connection between Bob and Charlotte, as Coppola shows it to us at the end of Lost in Translation, is a moment of intimate magnificence. I have never seen anything quite like it, in any movie.",
    "Longer on atmosphere and observation than on story, but you don't mind: Coppola maintains her quietly charged tone with a certainty that would be unbelievable in a second film if you didn't suspect genetics had a hand.",
    "A delicate, beautifully observed study of impossible romance, Lost in Translation is one of the best films this year.",
    "This year's must-see film.",
    "It's a bento box of shifts, feints, hints and small, sharp insights, built around a surprisingly deep core of feeling. And it confirms Coppola as an artist to watch and relish.",
    "Smart, funny, and splendidly acted.",
    "With cinemas dominated by underwhelming blockbusters and formulaic rom-coms, it’s easy to become disillusioned with the state of the movies. Thank the almighty, then, for Lost In Translation, which in 102 wondrous minutes will restore your faith in the power of the medium.",
    "Sofia Coppola's second movie as a director is more than a breakthrough: it's an insouciant triumph. She conjures a terrifically funny, heartbreakingly sad and swooningly romantic movie from almost nowhere and just makes it look very easy - as well as very modern and very sexy. It is a funky little Brief Encounter for the new century.",
    "Coppola both wrote and directed, and there’s a pleasing shapelessness to her scenes. She accomplishes the difficult feat of showing people being bored out of their skulls in such a way that we are never bored watching them.",
    "Watch Murray's eyes in the climactic scene in the hotel lobby: while hardly moving, they express the collapsing of all hopes, the return to a sleepwalking status quo. You won't find a subtler, funnier or more poignant performance this year than this quietly astonishing turn.",
    "Gorgeously shot by Lance Acord, who makes Toyko a gaudy dreamscape that's both seductive and frightening, Lost In Translation washes away memories of \"Godfather III,\" establishing Coppola as a major filmmaker in her own right, and reconfirming Johansson and Murray as actors of startling depth and power.",
    "As bittersweet a brief encounter as any in American movies since Richard Linklater's equally romantic \"Before Sunrise.\"",
    "This is the Bill Murray performance we've been waiting for: Saturday Night Live meets Chekhov.",
    "It gets at something exquisitely human, so human that even movie stars feel it.",
    "The movie contains priceless slapstick from Bill Murray, finely tuned performances by Murray and the beautiful Scarlett Johansson and a visual and aural design that cultivates a romantic though melancholy mood.",
    "Coppola handles her film with very pleasant economy, with a kind of warm precision. Her father, who was one of this picture's producers, can be as proud of her as we are grateful.",
    "A lovely, quietly thrilling thing.",
    "Don't stall about seeing Sofia Coppola's altogether remarkable Lost in Translation. It's a class-act liftoff for the fall movie season. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give performances that will be talked about for years.",
    "Dislocated from their native country and former lives, Bob and Charlotte come to establish a language of their own. Coppola has done the same, proving she boasts one of today's truly distinct filmmaking voices.",
    "A smartly written, confidently directed film that delivers big laughs while developing two of the year's most earnest characters and some of its most rewarding sentiments.",
    "Romantic comedies with two low-key leads can be asking for trouble, but one senses that the actors must have clicked on some fundamental level.",
    "It's a sign of just how much Coppola respects her characters that she doesn't make us privy to that final line: It is only meant for them to share. But like the rest of the ethereal Lost in Translation, you don't need to have it spelled out in order to feel it.",
    "By the time the film was half over, I was ready to catch the next flight to Japan. Until travel arrangements can be made, though, I'll just watch Lost in Translation again.",
    "There isn't another American screen actor who could have given this performance, not one who so deftly could have navigated the razor's edge separating the wiseacre and the wise.",
    "Arguably, Lost in Translation is the American answer to Wong Kar-wai's masterpiece, \"In the Mood for Love,\" though less about history, more about infatuation.",
    "Coppola does a fair job of capturing the fish-tank ambience of nocturnal, upscale Tokyo and showing how it feels to be a stranger in that world, and an excellent job of getting the most from her lead actors. Unfortunately, I'm not sure she accomplishes anything else.",
    "This movie registers like a pop song that enters the mind only in fragments because, as a whole, it lacks the style or substance to be memorable.",
    "Coppola lacks a firm grip on this material, and it starts to get away from her midway through.",
    "It can be funny, but the humor is too often based in stereotypical perceptions of Asians (they're short, they're laughably polite, they eat weird food), and Coppola shamelessly invites us to laugh along with Murray's character, who, believe it or not, thinks it's hilarious when his hosts get their \"r\"s and \"l\"s switched.",
    "Coppola hasn't delivered a turkey--it's a cute little movie, if not as rich as her brother Roman's similarly themed \"CQ\"--but when work this potentially satisfying remains flatly obvious, it's almost worse than being flat-out bad."

Our protagonists are a naive stuck-up girl right out of college and an equally stuck-up cynical actor. Neither show any real interest in Japanese culture (he's even quite disrespectful) and neither makes any really attempt to connect with the Japanese (even though they both get the chance to connect). Even though she seems to have a degree in philosophy and he seems to be somewhat of an intellectual type, their interactions remain mostly superficial. And still, their interaction with one another is pretty much everything we get to see for this entire film. I guess this film appeals to people just as pretentious and shallow as the main protagonist (which is the only reason I can think of to explain its popularity), but I personally found it hard to connect with either of them AT ALL.\r Further, I wonder how much sense it makes for their relationship to have remained purely platonic. Both seem to be estranged from their respective spouses, his wife is on the other side of the ocean, her husband is on a photo shoot for several days, both act like they haven't had sex in a long time, she's a beautiful impressionable young girl, he's a famous actor, they both don't shun alcohol and at one point they become close enough to lie together on a bed while he touches her feet. Maybe it's just me, but I personally find it hard to believe they didn't end up having sex together considering the aforementioned conditions. Anyway, the shame and confusion arising from such a situation (after both realise they made a mistake cheating their respective spouse) would at least have made a far more interesting film to watch Maybe this film appeals to people who never spent more than a few days in a foreign country, but having spent about 3 months in Poland I couldn't see anything I haven't experienced myself AT A FAR GREATER INTENSITY. For me, this makes \"Lost In Translation\" as exciting to watch as two people sitting at a bus stop waiting for the bus to arrive. Actually the latter would probably be more interesting, because the bus doesn't take THAT long to arrive.",

This film, with constant ramblings about loneliness, the meaning of love and the feeling of being lost (in life, in a city, in a marriage...) is certainly one of those films, unsuitable for those without the proper intellectual and philosophical disposition. Everything revolves around an actor and a young woman who, in the midst of their own frustrations, find themselves in the same hotel in Tokyo. They don't speak Japanese, they don't understand culture and mentality of that people (at the same time, innovative and traditionalist) and, after some talks, they understand that they're feeling the same yearnings for \"something more\", missing in their own lives. Chemistry between both characters is evident, it makes the public think that they will be lovingly involved at any moment, but not. It is an intellectual and sentimental chemistry that does not involve sensuality or romance. The biggest problem of the film is that it does not have much more to offer us and it has a very slow pace, lined by a slow soundtrack, to the taste of the director, Sofia Coppola. This will surely drive away the commercial audience, who usually wants entertainment and not a movie that makes them think.",

(NO SPOILERS AHEAD....) the ending is much different from the rest of the film and just for a second the audience gets a little piece of emotion. and you really see the characters for who they are. problem is the entire rest of the movie never set us up for such an ending. nobody wants a romantic happy ending garbage heap, but this movie was just so fixated on trying to be real that it just ended up being boring. as a viewer i felt that i was finally given the ending only because the director knew its what i wanted to see, and NoT because it was the actual direction the movie was meant to take. life doesnt always have a clear cut road and there arent always yes or no answers. this movie tries so hard to convey that message, but from actor to audience, somewhere in between the message seems to have been Lost in Translation.",

Japan and the Japanese are portrayed in a poor (and stereotyping) fashion, (video games, karaoke, gadgets, and the misprounciations of \"Ls\" as \"Rs\").There is borderline racism in this movie, as the way these two lead roles act, as if lost, estranged, abandoned, or stranded on the moon surrounded by Aliens. I've been to Japan (I'm a western European) and found no such culture shock. That is really the premise that this movie is built on - culture shock of White Western people finding themselves in Japan. And that is where it fell down for me. In terms of comedy, it was billed as \"Bill Murray - comedy genius - at his best.\" Far from it. I like Murray (Quick Change, Stripes, Caddyshack, etc.) This was just not funny, and I do not think there is any attempt for him to be funny.Scarlett.

I'll concede that it's beautifully filmed, that Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give great performances and that theLost in Translation is thoroughly disappointing. It appears to be pretty much universally praised, yet it's a flawed film. I'll concede that it's beautifully filmed, that Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give great performances and that the relationship between their two characters is sweet and endearing, as a tale of two lost souls finding a connection is always compelling. Despite these positives, the film puts forward an extremely patronising, stereotypical and borderline racist view of Japanese culture. By depicting a steady procession of carefully cherry-picked Japanese \"oddities\", it's almost like the film's main objective is to say \"hey, come laugh at the silly Japanese, they're not like Americans at all\". A recurring joke in the film is the mockery of Japanese speech pattern of the replacement of the letter r with the letter l. This gag is barely funny the first time it is used, but it is reprised four or five times throughout the film. In one of the key \"comedy\" scenes, Murray's character struggles to understand a heavily accented Japanese director during a photo shoot, and his mimicry of the poor man's voice to decipher each instruction isn't funny, just embarrassing, akin to the lack of logic behind an English-speaking tourist abroad raising his voice to make themselves understood to non-English speakers. To make matters even worse, the film is all-too-often slow or just plain boring. Beyond great chemistry between Murray and Johansson and striking aesthetics, the appeal of Lost in Translation is, well, lost in translation chiefly thanks to some criminal cultural insensitivity that really shouldn't be applauded in the modern world.",

Lost in Translation is a brilliant film, but also a film youI had been well aware of this film's reputation as a masterpiece for some time, and when I finally saw it I was so glad I did. I have seen it three times now, it improves each time. Lost in Translation is a brilliant film, but also a film you need to see more than once to appreciate it.Lost in Translation for example is a brilliantly written film. The script is wonderful, with a healthy balance of energetic humour and bittersweet soul-searching. The story, driven by its characters, is slowly-paced but purposefully so, any faster it would have detracted from any magic and poignancy and also would have made the title irrelevant. And I love the ambiguous but very meaningful ending. Lost in Translation manages to be both sad and funny, but it is also in its tone a magical and irresistibly moving film.I can't say I am a fan of Sophia Coppola. I can say though Lost in Translation is her best written and best directed film, and probably the only one I would consider a masterpiece. And speaking of Coppola, she makes some risky but wise decisions such as the balance of the humour and the bittersweet poignancy and altogether it is a rock-solid directing job.Lost in Translation looks absolutely beautiful too, with its skillful lighting, beguiling location work and stunning cinematography. The Japan-pop soundtrack creates a big emotional impact, and just adds to the authenticity Lost in Translation has.The acting is marvellous. Bill Murray gives a delicate, restrained and masterful performance in the lead role, and from his performance here you would never guess he is the same Bill Murray who starred in broader films like GhostBusters. Scarlett Johanssen also gives one of her best performances as the younger woman trapped in a loveless marriage, not to mention she looks lovely here and shares a believable chemistry with Murray.In conclusion, a masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

After all, After the first viewing, I thought it was racist, offensive and Bill Murray's performance was disgustingly arrogant. Scarlett Johanson is the director's alter ego, who may have felt alienated during her stay in Japan. After all, Sophia Coppola was probably a spoiled American brat with a huge ego. I really enjoyed this movie, it was very well designed, well filmed and the on-location sceneries were gorgeous and fascinating. Bill Murray destroyed all that. He was downright rude and thoughtless. And Scarlett has this innocent angel in a strange world attitude that is very annoying. Typical White American better-than-thou-over-other-inferior-race mentality. However, after the second viewing, it suddenly changed. We see Bill Murray as a typical unhappy American, unfaithful to his wife. We see his wife (through the fax machine) as a typical materialistic housewife. We see some Americans at the hotel as being very shallow and dumb. It seems like Sophia Coppola was in fact poking fun at both races. These two protagonists, however, were beginning to discover themselves while they have become alienated with Japan, their own lives as well as their very own people. Also, when Sophia Coppola received her Oscar at the ceremony, she cited Wong Kar Wai as one of her inspirations. All is forgiven! This is a good movie. It is one of those movies that are easily misunderstood (remember Natural Born Killers?).",

Despite all the positive reviews, people in the general public have either loved it or hated it. I, for one, loved this movie... and I believe there is a very simple explanation for why I fall into this catagory: I watched LIT in the theaters before all of the hype. I'd say 90% of the people who watched it under those circumstances (and with an open mind) enjoyed the movie. On the other hand, I would guess that 90% of the people who hate this movie only watched it (probably on DVD) after hearing the hype and falling for the misleading commercials that tried to pass this rather subtle movie off as \"hilarious\" and \"a laugh riot.\" Don't let the idiots in Universal's marketing department ruin this experience for you. LIT is a great movie for the intelligent movie fan. The rest of you should just go back to watching \"Alien vs. Predator.\"",

Definitely deserves best Drama. Hell, maybe even best picture. The thing is is that it portrays everything so realistically that you can relate to it. And now to comment on V.D.'s review. Boring? Yes I once heard that the average American Attention span was about 7 seconds. Thats the thing, if you don't have explosions every 3 seconds, you lose the crowd. That is the way it is with a lot of movies. Hell, I recently jusst watched the Leonardo Dicaprio version of Romeo and Juliet in school and tons of people found the ending extremely boring. My question is, WHY DON\"T YOU PEOPLE STOP SEEING MOVIES theN? If you can't enjoy a good movie, then don't see movies. I would be find if it were their opinion and had a bit more to say than just boring. Like, why it was boring. (Note: yes this is a bit late but I'm not calling Romeo and Juliet a good or bad movie, that is for another review so just lay off). Overall, Lost in Translation may be the best movie all year. You would do yourself injustice not to at least give this a try.",

Her takes in writing and directing movies within movies isn't new, but there's something new in this, maybe it is in a foreign setting. Movie star Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is going through a mid-life crisis. He went to Tokyo, Japan to promote a liquor drink that was going nowhere. Staying at a hotel and drinking at the bar downstairs everyday, he started seeing a newlywed who's also having a complication in her relationship, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). Perhaps the movie's main element isn't the top-notch award-winning script that shaped the movie in every way, or the stylish directing from Sofia Cappola, perhaps it's the unbelievable chemistry between Johansson and Murray (nominated for an Oscar). Lost In Translation really changed Hollywood's perspectives in some ways and Bill Murray/Scarlet Johansson is the best on-screen couple I've seen in years.",
