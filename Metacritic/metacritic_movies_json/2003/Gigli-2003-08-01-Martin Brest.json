  "title": "Gigli",
  "rating": 4.8,
  "release_date": "2003-08-01",
  "summary": "In this unconventional romantic comedy, low-level hood Larry Gigli (Affleck) is given an assignment that gets him in way over his head and Ricki (Lopez), a gorgeous free spirited female enforcer is sent in to assist him.  (Sony)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Lopez and Affleck are sweet and appealing in their performances; the buzz said they didn't have chemistry, but the buzz was wrong. What they don't have is conviction.",
    "A watchable bad movie, but it's far from your typical cookie-cutter blockbuster. There are no shoot-outs or car chases, and there isn't much romantic suspense, either.",
    "Some of the dialogue is astonishingly awful. Sex and relationships are constantly likened to animal interaction.",
    "For the most part I was able to accept this thesis and enjoy Lopez in her usual superwoman role, but the script does get awfully preachy in spots.",
    "Arrives carrying more baggage than a Greyhound bus, which may distract moviegoers from what is a silly but still an enjoyably written and performed romantic comedy.",
    "Writer-director Martin Brest lends the film a professional sheen, and his stars (who some rumors suggest may have become romantically involved) have charisma to spare, but the film has all the charge and momentum of a Paxil ad.",
    "Turns out to be merely bad -- not a train wreck, not the crime against humanity it's been rumored to be.",
    "After five minutes, Christopher Walken  vanishes. We wait vainly for the next 90 minutes for someone, anyone to bring that kind of danger, unpredictability and vitality to a story as drab as army fatigues.",
    "Has a curious train-wreck quality to it that keeps you watching and thinking. (Even if you are thinking things like, Why were these lines ever written? When you hear the \"turkey\" line, your jaw will drop.)",
    "So how bad, in the final analysis, is Gigli? The best that can be said is that it doesn't beat out \"The Ladies Man\" as the most abrasively awful film of the past five years, nor does it top \"Battlefield Earth\" for sheer misguided lunacy.",
    "Gigli berates, insults, dismisses, throttles, and bellows at Bartha's meticulously aped retard, and then turns sensitive and warm—it's hard to decide which attitude is more insulting.",
    "The problem with Gigli is that it is an inept attempt to do Elmore Leonard by Martin Brest, a filmmaker whose coarse sensibility makes him catastrophically unqualified to the task.",
    "Excruciating...The movie proves to be singularly unfunny and static almost from the non-get-go. Virtually nothing happens; the movie is all premise.",
    "Gigli is a disaster.",
    "A hypnotic, black hole of a movie that sucks reputations, careers and goodwill down its vortex. Rarely has a movie that doesn't star Madonna achieved such a skin-crawling mixture of deluded preening and bungled humour.",
    "The only people likely to get a kick out of Gigli -- the first screen teaming of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez -- are Madonna and her director hubby Guy Ritchie. Finally there's a movie as jaw-droppingly awful as their \"Swept Away.\"",
    "Gigli's awfulness is of a rarer, more precious variety. It's the sort of bizarre, ill-conceived picture you can't believe exists, but are secretly glad it does.",
    "There is no histrionic excess or crackpot camp, only hoary sentiment, the puppy-dog cuteness of the mentally handicapped, and the proposition that the \"cure\" for lesbianism is one good man brave enough to get in touch with his inner cow.",
    "Put together enough pointless, random details, and you get Gigli, a movie that's less incompetent than bewildering.",
    "An embarrassing debacle...the rare movie that never seems to take off, but also never seems to end. It tries hard to titillate, but ends up making audiences want to avert their eyes.",
    "Affleck, for his part, behaves as if a Zero from \"Pearl Harbor\" dropped one too close to his noggin. He looks permanently shell-shocked.",
    "The spectacle of the near-naked Ricki (Lopez) striking sexually provocative yoga poses while floridly extolling the virtues of female genitalia is particularly mortifying, but it's only one of many horribly miscalculated scenes.",
    "Buried in the slow, talky, inanities that the two stars exchange are some potentially interesting ideas about female sexual self-assertion and male surrender, but neither the actors nor the filmmakers have any notion about how to explore them.",
    "Nearly as unwatchable as it is unpronounceable.",
    "Guys, I'm telling you: Don't go to this movie! It's \"Chasing Amy\" with guns! You're walking into a trap! This is for fans of the holy couple, but they already know that.",
    "How fortunate that the J. Lo bod, majestic butt and all, finds itself in excellent working order in Gigli: There is precious little other consolation in this formless windbag of a romantic comedy.",
    "Has no story, no redeeming characters that anyone could care about, and the actors are all on autopilot, completely soaked with their own vanity.",
    "The movie is bafflingly boring and ridiculous. Its loginess is exacerbated by the pacing of the writer-director, Martin Brest.",
    "The film lacks a controlling point of view to guide an audience through so improbable a tale. Nothing in the movie is funny -- aside from giggles provoked by misfired jokes -- or romantic or dramatic.",
    "Wretched. And while the dirtiest, low-rottenest part of me wouldn’t mind watching the institution of Ben/Jen get reamed, the heft of the blame should be shouldered by Hollywood vet Martin Brest, who wrote an incoherent, incompetent script and further mangled it with his direction.",
    "After the schadenfreudian thrill of watching beautiful people humiliate themselves wears off, it has the same annihilating effect on your will to live.",
    "It’s just a mess.",
    "The most thoroughly joyless and inept film of the year, and one of the worst of the decade. We're talking about a disaster, and not of the fun \"Showgirls\" variety, either.",
    "An overlong, joyless, and inconsequential affair, full of dead air, and possessing only a few moments of jaw-dropping bad taste. It's a dull disaster.",
    "Uncomfortable, offensive, and boring.",
    "Enervated, torpid, slack, dreary and, oh yes, nasty, brutish and long."

Lopez matches him in the outstanding department, with great scenes on giant couch and with balloon simulators. The storyline is very much clever and filled with twists and turns that would make M. Night Shamylan blush. How Martino Breaszt failed to win the Academy Oscar Award for this film is beyond me, it is reminding me of the fellow Rob Reiner's best film movies. Also Pacino gives excellent performance, almost as good as his Corleone character but darker and with more conviction. Genius film. Big 10/10.",

That's the full extent of the entertainment value I got from 'Gigli'. I don't know why \"Your name is Bob\" made me laugh, but it did … pity none of the other jokes in this lame excuse for a movie was better than mediocre. Nearly all its plot elements are culled in near-carbon copy form from films that used them much more effectively, the music is bland, the production values are bland, none of the characters is interesting, and to top it off, it's unduly offensive to intellectually disabled people. (Having spent significant amounts of time around some of them, I know how intellectually disabled people act. They're not nearly as perverted as their representative in this movie, Brian--if anything, they run from that attitude.) Furthermore, it's a borderline-momentous occasion when 'Gigli's' plot does move forward. Otherwise it's all bickering. This is not a movie about petty legislators. This is a movie about mobsters. What happens in 'Gigli' goes thoroughly against the mobster-film ethos. All involved should be ashamed of themselves for this awful excuse for entertainment.",
