  "critic_reviews": [
    "Big Fish really is a big delight.",
    "A tale that's so enriching, so heartwarming, so funny, so touching and so breathtaking, you'll wonder why the king of wackiness didn't branch out sooner.",
    "Director Tim Burton finally hooks the one that got away: a script that challenges and deepens his visionary talent.",
    "Even with Burton's imagination turning its trademark cartwheels, the film's big beating heart holds the whimsical offshoots steady.",
    "Has enough tasty bait to satisfy an array of moviegoers: Burton fans, Albert Finney fans, fans of tall tales well spun by experts and fans of movies that don't look like any other.",
    "A word of warning. Big Fish is so strange and so literary that audiences seeking conventional fare may get impatient with it. But it always takes effort to catch the big ones. This one is worth it.",
    "This picture boasts a story about a yarn-spinning Southern father (Albert Finney) and a sober-sided son (Billy Crudup) that gives it ballast and staying power beyond anything in previous, precious Burton fables like \"Edward Scissorhands\" or \"Ed Wood.\"",
    "When it catches fire, this great-looking movie offers hilarious diversions.",
    "Burton rebounds in a big way with Big Fish, a Daniel Wallace adaptation and visual feast that recaptures the fairy-tale simplicity and wrenching emotional power of \"Edward Scissorhands.\"",
    "An achievement of this magnitude is a stunning and extremely pleasant surprise.",
    "In anchoring the whimsy to something more heartfelt, Burton is greatly aided by Billy Crudup, who underplays potentially cringeworthy bedside scenes with his dying dad.",
    "The movie is a gently overstuffed cinematic piñata, crammed with tall tales -- with giants and circuses and fairy-tale woods, plus a huge squirmy catfish, all served up with a literal matter-of-fact fancy that is very pleasing.",
    "Big Fish is a clever, smart fantasy that targets the child inside every adult, without insulting the intelligence of either.",
    "Burton's film is an American version of the Odyssey.",
    "Too well-made and well-acted to be entirely cute -- but the result is fairly tepid in comparison to the overheated highlights of Burton's career.",
    "Like virtually all fish stories, it's discursive, funny, full of boasting, a suspect mix of truth and lies with an emphasis on the latter.",
    "Such astringent details as a banjo player plucking a few ominous notes from \"Dueling Banjos\" when Ed first lays eyes on the Norman Rockwellian beauty of Spectre ensure that the story's fundamental sweetness never becomes cloying.",
    "There's delight to be had from watching Burton conjure up one fantastical Edward-inspired scenario after another.",
    "An engagingly whimsical, sporadically charming, frequently very funny Southern Gothic fantasy that somehow doesn't quite come together to be as magical or meaningful as it's intended to be.",
    "The problem is, there's just not enough Burton in Big Fish.",
    "But Burton and August have added ­anger to the mix, and it sours much of the otherwise wondrous tone.",
    "Big Fish of course is a great-looking film, with a fantastical visual style that could be called Felliniesque if Burton had not by now earned the right to the adjective Burtonesque.",
    "This is a theme tailor-made for Burton, although there are times in the movie when it feels like he's not taking enough advantage of it.",
    "The actor's job here is the hardest to pull off, since practical skepticism in a Tim Burton picture is next to villainy. Yet Crudup suggests complex grown-up feelings that makes the rest of Big Fish feel like an earnest collection of magic tricks.",
    "For the first time, Burton seems comfortable walking around the real world.",
    "The imaginatively illustrated but precariously precious film offers up a string of minor pleasures but never becomes more than moderately amusing or involving.",
    "Has moments of genuine emotion...but overall, the film feels like it issues from a place Burton doesn't inhabit.",
    "The most curious thing about this magical-realist fable...is how thin and soft it is, how unpersuasive and ultimately forgettable even its most strenuous inventions turn out to be.",
    "It's nicely made, well shot, and reasonably well acted, yet it's enough to filet the life force right out of you. We need stories in order to dream, and to live. But that doesn't mean we have to buy every crappy one that comes down the pike.",
    "What a waste of a fine cast.",
    "The Alabama setting is as phony as the one in Forrest Gump, and for all of Finney's effectiveness as a yarn-spinning geezer, his whoppers seem disconnected from his character and each other--a weakness Burton fails to resolve with an awkward Felliniesque finale.",
    "A misfire. The film that wants to be lighter than air instead crashes to earth with the swiftness of a concrete parachute.",
    "The film fairly groans from all the narrative gamesmanship and lavish romantic gestures...The unbewitched viewer may groan as well.",
    "An abundance of dull exposition building up to the son's attempt to cap his father's whoppers climaxes with a tedious flurry of Fellini-esque endings and Spielbergian fillips. The magic doesn't work twice -- or even once.",
    "The whole seems disjointed, incoherent and lacking in the startling originality of the other two Edwards (Scissorhands and Wood) who, half a career back, poured from Burton's distended outsider imagination.",
    "The most fluid, lyrical, and even-toned work of his (Burton's) career. It's also the most boring by a factor of 10.",
    "Tim Burton is all grown up and getting serious with this wildly scattershot tale.",
    "Big Fish stinks from the head.",
    "A disappointingly dull thud of a fantasy.",
    "A long-winded indulgence in tear-and-a-smile whimsy, elevated above the merely irritating and saccharine by compelling art direction."

It is about the life of a man whose father loves to tells stories from the time he was young, but the problem is that the anecdotes are hard to believe, because there are extremely rare and unlikely to happen; for example the story of the eye of a witch that can tell you when you are going to die, the one of a giant who is convinced to leave and stop terrifying a town, the circus that is managed by a werewolf or the scape from a war with two Siamese. All this produce constant fights between Edward and his son; and this is one of the topics that Tim Burton treats on his films. Although the other topics from this great director are less developed they are also noticeable: the gothic and expressionist characters (the witch, the giant and the circus manager) and environments (the forest and the witch house); and the contrast between two worlds represented graphically, the present in which Edward tells his stories (darker or opaque colors) and the past in which the stories take place (bright and attractive colors).\rThe thing is that does not matter if the anecdotes were real or not, you decide what you want to believe, you can live a boring life and had nothing interesting to tell, no dreams, no hope, no goals; or you can live an amazing life, with endless stories to tell and enjoy being a Big Fish.",

Big Fish is I think one of Burton's better movies in my personal opinion, maybe not his very best, but it isI will admit I like Tim Burton, and have enjoyed a vast majority of his films, Edward Scissorhands, Beetle Juice, Batman and Ed Wood. Big Fish is I think one of Burton's better movies in my personal opinion, maybe not his very best, but it is a very sweet, imaginative and moving film. Here Burton delves into familiar territory, a strange place between reality and fantasy, dream and nightmare. The story is really sweet, and while slow at times, does have a poignant ending. The visuals as pretty much always in a Tim Burton film are gorgeous, not Gothic here like in Sleepy Hollow and Edward Scissorhands but evergreen and picturesque. The scenery was beautiful and so was the cinematography, and Danny Elfman's score is stunning. His score for Edward Scissorhands blew me away, but the lyrical, sensitive and hypnotic themes used here make it a score that is truly special. The screenplay is well crafted, and has a bittersweet feel to it. Sentimental yes, but also bittersweet. The acting is remarkably good, with Ewan McGregor making for a handsome yet somewhat charming young Edward Bloom, and the wonderful Albert Finney a revelation as his older self. Billy Crudup is excellent as the son who is intent on exposing his father, and sets out to learn the truth, and Danny DeVito is great as the shape-changing circus ringmaster. Jessica Lange is beautiful and alluring as Sandra and Helena Bonham Carter is almost unrecognisable as the Witch. Then there is Alison Lohman, Marion Cottilard, Robert Guillaume and Matthew McGory(as Karl the Giant) and they are very good as well. Overall, I loved this film, it is moving and very imaginative. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",

Wallace's novel has enough room for the tale to be both practical and fictional, his characters can fly and still be grounded. And frankly August's adaptation doesn't have that. And it itches the picture throughout the course and is why Burton keeps leaning on to practicality, he somehow feels obliged to keep it true and on track. As far as all the tactics that paints the fantasy world on screen, it is Burton's home ground.That half of the tale is not only intriguing but exhilarating to encounter, it is also emotionally fueled. The emotions, in fact are real, the giant, the red car, the daffodils and the witch, these are the facts. And Burton never feels short handed in such genre. Ticking for two hours, the overkill sets in early. And that somehow fortunately follows up to be McGregor's strength. He gets enough time and range on screen for us to fall in love with him, when he does, and laugh at him when he is having fun. But personally, I prefer, Ed Bloom when Finney plays it.He is more mature and overprotective as much as stubborn he is. His last act with his son is what the entire movie thrives on. The supporting cast like Cotillard, Crudup and Carter fails to live up to the lead ones. Burton emerges the emotions aptly on screen, it's the mechanism that it follows needs some polishing. Merely as a concept wise, it can be an intriguing discussion for a dinner table conversation but as far as major motion picture is concerned, Big Fish is frankly a stretch of an undercooked script that should have broken up a long time ago.",

But the strongest emotions are found between the broken relationship of a dying father and his doubtful son. After years of no communication, they are reunited when human age reaches its fragile state. The son sits on a chair as he observes his weak father, who lies in what could be his deathbed.\r Old Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is a devoted storyteller who believes that true stories could use a little fiction for entertainment purposes. On the day his only son, Will, was born, he was out of town selling home appliances. Not a very exciting story for such a very momentous event. When Will is set to be married, his father shares with everyone the false account of how he caught a really big fish with his wedding ring the same day Will was born. This draws smiles from his listeners, but not from Will, who has heard the same lie repeatedly throughout his life. He walks away. And he doesn't return until old Edward becomes confined to his bedroom/\r Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/big-fish/",

I hated it initially, but this time, it was marvelous. Maybe my tastes have simply just changed in that time, but wow, this was awesome. Billy Crudup is stellar, as are Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Marion Cotillard, and Jessica Lange. A fantastical adventure through the stories told to a man by his now dying father, Big Fish is a touching film that should strike a chord with every man in some way, in terms of his relationship with his father. This film is very much imperfect. The story could have told better for sure and the film can be a bit distant at times, but none of that matters because Big Fish touches you in a way that many films cannot. An imaginative film that is very much about the men it concerns more so than the stories told here, Big Fish is a winner because of the heart at its core, more so than the stories it told that may not make much sense and could have been told better. After a while, the tall tales told here become entirely endearing, which is just too darn appropriate.",

The narration is done in aThis is a fantasy drama, covering themes including parental love and reconciliation. It starts off with narration that comes across as very matter-of-fact - that was one of the first things I noticed about it. The narration is done in a somewhat heavy Southern American accent, so if you struggle to understand Southern American dialects then this may put you off it. I found myself wondering how likely it would be for Ewan McGregor to be American - his American accent is reasonable but I suppose he just looks particularly British to my eyes, that I found it a bit of a strech to believe he could have been the character he plays (Edward Bloom).I found the film to be relatively diverting, quite quirky in some of the plot twists, the imaginative nature of the sub-plots and there were some funny moments. I think it'd be fair to say that this film is quite charming, although more critical people who aren't keen on family friendly fantasy style films may think of this, alternatively, as quite cheesy and boring possibly, although the main word to come to my mind was silly rather than boring but silly in an eye-roll and walk away kind of a way. I definitely did enjoy watching it, so I'm not in the more negative camp (if you know what I mean). I felt the film was somehow quite immersive - there's a good use of musical score, along with a nice use of visual effects including characters being seen to grow substantially taller in a very short space of time, plus some mythical creatures which appear to be brought to life, presumably via CGI and also there are scenes which accentuate the colours present in a strong way, where grass appears to be almost neon green. That all adds to the fantastical sense of it. I'd say that this film does quite well at creating a sort of magical atmosphere - something which isn't always present in such family films. Some scenes feature quite soft lighting, making it look almost as if we're watching the film through a very thin film of smoke . It gives a kind of dreamy feel to it, I suppose.I noticed when the film started that it was directed by Tim Burton, which surprised me, given that its a family film and thus doesn't have an element of horror or gothic presence. Having said that, I can certainly say that his quirks come across in the content of the film. His films do tend to be quite immersive in general, as is this film, if you can get over Ewan McGregor being a 'yank' with his southern drawl.Cast wise, apart from Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney and Billy Crudup both appear, giving good, solid performances. Steve Buscemi also appears, as does Danny DeVito - the various characters are, of course, quite quirky and interesting, although some are more memorable than others, including Buscemi's character, entitled 'Norther Winslow' and DeVito's, 'Amos Calloway' a circus manager. Female actors include Jessica Lange, Alison Loman, Marian Cotillard and (of course, given its directed by Tim Burton) Helena Bonham Carter.The music is quite dreamy, fairly upbeat, not thumping dance tracks but light pieces, some sounding quite Southern American (not south American, more sort of hillbilly-ish, though I honestly don't mean that in a derrogatory sense), think along the lines of banjos and acoustic guitars.Content wise, this film contains a few mild obscenities, some potentially frightening scenes for particularly young viewers (such as one where a character realises that someone has turned in to a wolf which attempts to attack them), although no extreme, or graphic, detail is shown and next to no graphic injuries are depicted. There are one or two mild sex references, with mentions of affairs being made. This film is unlikely to greatly scare children over the age of about maybe 10 or so, I'd have thought. It carries a PG rating to reflect this.The families depicted in this film seem quite Hollywood, in that the individual people seem to get along really well and there's definitely this feeling of idealism present, which may unnerve some people, thats ignoring the main character, who (obviously) has his strained relationship with his dad to contend with. I did feel that this film was trying to be quite sort of moralistic and im not sure im especially keen on family films that perhaps attempt to, in a sense, preach to kids as such but I'm not sure its meant (or, alternatively, ought) to be taken entirely seriously. I admit I don't tend to watch a great deal of family fantasy style films but something about this one did definitely appeal to me and I did enjoy watching it. Its very much quirky, imaginative and perhaps eccentric (what do you expect from Tim Burton?!). I can think of worse ways to while away a couple of hours (as is this films running time).Yes I'd recommend this film as an entertaining family fantasy film for children of about 10 years plus. Its got good visual effects, memorable characters, a good musical score and I found it both quirky and charming.",
