    "In our wistful estimation, the most delightful comedy-romance in years.",
    "A charming, if often-seen, tale, paced with alacrity by Wilder from the adaptation of Taylor's hit play. [Review of re-release]",
    "A slick blend of heart and chuckles makes Sabrina a sock romantic comedy.",
    "Sabrina is playfully seductive, and will leave almost all viewers, even those as cold as Linus, with a smile on their lips and a warm glow in their hearts. [Review of re-release]",
    "Gold, in a word, is guaranteed at the boxoffice, and this is never less than glittering entertainment, but somehow a certain measure of lead has found its way into the formula.",
    "Billy Wilder's 1954 version of the Samuel Taylor staple was a perfect vehicle for Audrey Hepburn, though the cut is too tight for her costars, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden. [Review of re-release]"

Again Hepburn proves that she was the princess of the silver screen and the film is a depressing reminder of just how far the industry has fallen in 50 years. The story is a masterpiece of simplicity and proves that complexity is not synonymous with effectiveness. The only way this film loses marks is because it is unoriginal but original films very rarely feel so rousing. 91/100",

      "content": "Long before Mike Nichols' released his masterpiece The Graduate in 1967, Humphrey Bogart's Linus Larrabee and writer/director Billy Wilder knew what the future held: plastics. That guy in The Graduate was a day late and a dollar short, evenLong before Mike Nichols' released his masterpiece The Graduate in 1967, Humphrey Bogart's Linus Larrabee and writer/director Billy Wilder knew what the future held: plastics. That guy in The Graduate was a day late and a dollar short, even though he pretended to be ahead of the curve on plastics. Ha!Telling the story of a chauffeur's daughter who falls for one of the sons of the family he father works for, only to wind up being shipped off to France to lose this affection, only to return and fall in love with both him and his brother, Sabrina is an incredibly fun film. Starring Audrey Hepburn as the titular character, she may be much younger than either David (William Holden), her first love, or his brother Linus (Bogart), but still sells the romance incredibly well. Tremendously written and directed by Wilder, Sabrina is a light on its feet romantic comedy that consistently delivers laughs, charm, and wit, as this woman struggles with love only to find it in a place that she never expected.Always radiant in her roles, Hepburn's naturally bubbly demeanor makes her a perfect match for the role of Sabrina. A Manic Pixie Dream Girl through and through, she exists to make Linus and David find themselves and embrace new possibilities in life to improve their happiness. Shipped off to France for two years to learn how to cook and get over David, she returns only to fall in love with both David and Linus again and then head off to Paris once more, except she will possibly not be alone. While the role is one that largely exists to open the eyes of her male counterparts, Hepburn makes Sabrina her own and really injects life into the role. Nominated for Best Actress for the role, it is immediately apparent why and it has nothing to do with her natural charisma and charm. While the comedic lines zip and the romance swoons, Hepburn's greatest characteristic is her eyes. She knew how to work her eyes and have them communicate an entire scene simply by emoting through her face and eyes. As she dances with David and Linus, you can practically read her thoughts through her frequent usage of non-verbal cues. While her natural bounce and radiance are certainly quite appealing and Hepburn makes great use of both in this dreamy role, she finds her best success in these non-verbal cues that communicate more than words ever could.As one of her potential mates, Bogart plays the rough and tough-nosed Linus incredibly well. As is typical of Bogart roles, he has an incredibly hard exterior to the point that one begins to wonder if there is a beating hard inside or not. Running his father's company with his brother David more interested in chasing a new dame each week, Linus is business focused. Dating is not for him and he never even considered marriage. Instead, he is married to his job and would not want a woman to get involved in that, for fear of her getting hurt. Yet, as he shows with Sabrina, there is a heart inside after all. No matter how tough he appears to be and how career-focused he professes to be, he longs to have that connection with a woman, but is simply afraid to take that leap without being pushed. Once pushed, however, he falls hard and becomes a hopeless romantic. As the main recipient of Sabrina's dream girl powers, Linus finally embraces life's pleasures and is able to leave his office and find a love for experience and romantic indulgence.His brother David similarly grows, even if the film does not really focus on him. From playboy to settled in engaged man, David learns to embrace the business side of his family and not always actively revolt against adulthood. Though forced into a marriage of convenience, he finds that everything is not so bad after all and he does actually love the girl he is marrying. Instead, similar to his brother, he was afraid to jump in and settle down, for fear of becoming an adult. Yet, through his encounters with Sabrina, he finally finds what he always wanted and was afraid to grab: a life that is not just bed hopping.While its characters are admittedly a bit cliche by today's standards, they are all impeccably interesting and fun to watch grow throughout. Plus, while Sabrina may be a Manic Pixie Dream Girl, she does have a mind of her own and is not just some helpless girl. Instead, she desperately wants romance and will take whatever is given to her. When she cannot get this, she is entirely satisfied with running off to Paris and finding the romance she craves in the Parisian aesthetic that she so loves. That said, while the film's characters are a great credit to it, the film's comedy is really where it stands out. As a romantic comedy, the comedy is always crucial and the film's comedic wit and whip smart moments are really what makes this one so endearing and charming. Hepburn, Bogart, and Holden, certainly all contribute to this charm and speak to how well-cast the film was, but a lot of this charm is also found in the writing as the film just flies by",

Still, I can't **** on the film considering I had a great laugh while watching it, despite a lot of that laughter coming from how amazingly horrible every decision that every character in this film makes. Far from my favorite offering from Billy Wilder, but if you feel you may enjoy this film then I wholeheartedly encourage you to watch it.",
