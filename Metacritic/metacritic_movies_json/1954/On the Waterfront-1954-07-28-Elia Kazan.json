  "summary": "Marlon Brando gives one of the screen's most electrifying performances as Best Actor in this 1954 Academy Award winning Best Film as Ex-fighter Terry Malloy, who could have been a contender but now toils for boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) on the gang-ridden waterfront.  [Sony]",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The acting and the best dialogue passages have an impact that has not dimmed; it is still possible to feel the power of the film and of Brando and Kazan, who changed American movie acting forever.",
    "A draining experience from beginning to end, relentless in its portrayal of inhumanity.",
    "Outstanding performances are turned in by Karl Malden in the role of a priest who makes the waterfront characters his particular charge, by Lee J. Cobb, as the big bully who bosses the boys, by Rod Steiger, John Hamilton and a couple of well-known pugilists, Tony Galento and Tami Mauriello.",
    "The chance to watch a four-star classic the way it was meant to be seen -- fresh print, big screen -- is so rare as to be worth the trip.",
    "As unspoiled in its key elements as the day it was made, \"On the Waterfront\" is indisputably one of the great American films, its power undiminished. Even more today than half a century ago, it demands to be seen.",
    "Politics apart, though, it's pretty electrifying.",
    "This brutal, violently realistic drama, set against the sordid background of the New York waterfront, packs a terrific wallop that results in topflight entertainment.",
    "Kazan succeeds in producing a shrewd piece of screen journalism, a melodrama in the grand manner of Public Enemy and Little Caesar. But he fails to do anything more serious—largely because he tries too hard. In searching for the general meaning in little lives, Director Kazan has trained his lens down fine on small events; he has too often watched his characters through the magnifying glass of special prejudice—the old sentimental prejudice that ordinary people are wonderful no matter what they do.",
    "On the Waterfront may have baggage, but that doesn't prevent it from being one of the great American productions of the mid-20th century.",
    "It's hard to deny that Marlon Brando's performance as a dock worker and ex-fighter who finally decides to rat on his gangster brother (Rod Steiger) is pretty terrific.",
    "Moviemaking of a rare and high order.  (Review of Original Release)",
    "Under Elia Kazan's direction, Marlon Brando puts on a spectacular show, giving a fascinating, multi-faceted performance.",
    "Like many cult films, it is also less than the sum of its parts.",
    "We must salute screenwriter Budd Schulberg (his speech for priest Karl Malden in the loading bay is still stirring). Add the acting/writing heroics a restrained score by Leonard Bernstein and a striking, charcoal look by cinematographer Boris Kaufman, and you have an elegiac portrait of labour relations that feels like a kick in the slats.",
    "Brando made one of his most indelible impressions in this relentlessly dramatic, ever-controversial tale of loyalty and betrayal in the world of working-class unions."

Based on a series of articles that appeared a New York newspaper at the time it tells the gripping story of union violence and corruption amongst longshoremen on the docks of Hoboken, New Jersey.\r For a film that is now close to sixty years old On the Waterfront has aged remarkably, largely thanks to Brando in what must still be amongst the greatest ever screen performances. There are a few signs of the films era, such as the slightly intrusive music, and as with many early Hollywood movies it is a little slow in places. None of this can detract from the overall quality of the film however and it remains an example of 50's Hollywood cinema at its best.",

      "content": "Arguably director Elia Kazan's best known work, On the Waterfront features a career-high for both its director and its star Marlon Brando in this dramatic depiction of corruption, intimidation, and ambition. Set on the docks of New Jersey,Arguably director Elia Kazan's best known work, On the Waterfront features a career-high for both its director and its star Marlon Brando in this dramatic depiction of corruption, intimidation, and ambition. Set on the docks of New Jersey, the film shows the level of control possessed by mob boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb). A terrifying presence, his shadow looms over inch of the waterfront, with him and his henchmen deciding who can actually work that day and who must go home. Corrupt and deeply involved in the criminal underworld, Friendly and his men seek to silence any possible \"cheese eaters\" by any means necessary. Part of the peripheral of their crew is former boxer Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando). Working as a longshoremen, he is the young brother of Friendly's right hand man, Charley the Gent (Rod Steiger). This gives him ample opportunity at the docks, but also puts him in the crosshairs of the criminal case and, as such, finds himself getting squeezed by the cops. Starting a romance with pure girl Edie (Eva Marie Saint), Terry must decide whether he wants to remain loyal to Johnny or to himself.Opening with one of the best first acts I have seen, in which Terry visits his friend Joey Doyle (Ben Wagner), On the Waterfront's opening sets the tone. Giving Joey a pigeon that he believes belongs to him, Terry is merely there to setup Joey. Professing later on that he thought that Johnny Friendly's men were just going to rough him up a bit and not kill him, this opening scene not only shows the vicious nature of the Friendly gang, but also sets up the conflict that will consume Terry's being. Feeling great remorse for getting his friend killed and then being unable to face Edie, Joey's sister, with the truth even when the two begin going together, Terry realizes his only way out is to rat. However, in doing so, everybody he loves will be put in danger. But, to not do so would be to become complicit in the continued exploitation of the longshoremen by the ruthless mobsters that run the union.Through this tale of corruption and intimidation, On the Waterfront paints a frightening picture of blue collar America and how easily it can transform into lawlessness if a ruthless criminal gets their hands on it. Easily crushing all opposing forces due to the desperation in the area, Johnny Friendly is the gatekeeper  between being broke and being able to work for a living. In essence, he is the man capable of ruining you or helping you. His brutal killings and beatings of those that step out of line only further establishes him as the head honcho in the area and not a man to be toyed with. Leaning on a local priest, Father Barry (Karl Maiden), for help and strength, Terry must overcome his own issues and fears to be able to stand up to this powerful man and tell the truth to the courts. Through this, the film becomes not just scary portrayal of crime and its influence on the poor, but also on the strength and courage it takes to stand up in the face of absolute adversity.One of the more apparent themes at play in On the Waterfront is ambition and life goals. Having become hardened over time due to his exposure to the crime underworld, Terry has largely given up on his dreams. Once a promising boxer, he had to throw away his career to allow the mob to win its bet on the fight. Now, he opts to avoid having dreams to avoid future pain. As a result, he never reached his potential in life and is left wallowing as a longshoreman that is considered a bum by everyone around him, even Edie's father and often times, Edie herself. Having passed on every opportunity before him and throwing away his life in the name of supporting his brother and Johnny, Terry must finally work towards his own goals. No longer can he put everybody else ahead of himself. Being selfish is a quality he desperately needs to learn, as without it, he is being trampled on by all the men on the docks. He is a man who feels he has failed in life and by ratting on the crime bosses, he can finally live up to his own expectations for himself and not be such a disappointment. He can be more than a bum and not have to worry about becoming a beggar on the streets. He can live in the comfort of the knowledge that he did what was right and lifted the control of the docks away from criminals.Featuring a career-best performance from Marlon Brando, On the Waterfront may be a bit too melodramatic at times with a poor-to-mediocre romance given too much screentime, but on the back of excellent direction from Kazan and Brando's bravado, it lives up to its classic billing. Brando's authenticity as an actor and his committed performance as Terry really bring the film to life and make it feel akin to something out of the Italian neo-realism due to its intense focus on the harsh reality of life. Now, a lot of this is due to Kazan to be sure, but Brando brings truth to this representation of life. He is Terry Malloy. Terry Malloy is him.",

The prestige of this monochromic magnum opus is merelyThis Kazan-Brando collaboration (after A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, 1951 9/10) finally granted both an Oscar along with a sweeping 8 wins including BEST PICTURE out of 12 nominations. The prestige of this monochromic magnum opus is merely indisputable so as to my sheer expectation could not be more intrigued.\r It is a forthright story, a bum longshoreman’s awakening to his conscience and takes on a venal union boss and his heavy minions. There are several incentives for his self-morphing into a better person, his love to a girl who in turn elicits his true grit, the demise of his brother (a pretty slow-witted move to put the final nail in the coffin to urge a man at his wits’ end to go to the opposite of the line), and a religious influence from a virtuous priest, whose righteous homily is spirit-lifting but cannot deliver the huddled mass from numb apathy. Against the grain, it is also an indictment of the repressed workers who is suffer from crowd conformity psychology and cowardice, the most abhorrent thing is one of the sidekick child massacres all the pigeons just to demonstrate an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth when Brando finally musters his courage to be a key witness in a murder case against the boss, it feels blatantly inexplicable and rather far-fetched. The same can be referred to the ending, a battered-up Brando (with horrible bloodstain make-up) struggles to stand up and walk towards the gate so rest of the longshoremen can be convinced that they should follow suit and disregard whatever reasons hold them back. It is a too-well calculated victory.\r Bad-mouthing about some uneasiness while watching this picture aside, Brando emanates a tremendous air of competence as the young loafer stranded in the underbelly of the dock, his two-hander with Eva Marie Saint comes well-handled, alternately romantic and endangered, and Saint’s film debut is also a fortuitous triumph for her, a borderline leading part nabbed BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS trophy. Wondrously, the film also holds the record of securing three slots as BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR nominees (but no win), Kazan’s longtime workmate Malden emotes a paragon crime-defender as the priest, J. Cobb is the pure evil as the ringleader while his henchmen are completely imbecile and a young Steiger is the in-between as the ill-fated brother, an ambiguous image betrays great empathy in the illustrious conversing scenes inside the taxi with Brando.\r ON THE WATERFRONT also manifests Kazan’s top-notch deployment of the camera, with DP Boris Kaufman, the close-ups and fixated angle shots run fluently without tampering the rhythm of its grim reality. Leonard Bernstein’s accompanying score adheres firmly to the vascular impulse of the predictable diegesis. Thus, it is a fine piece of filmmaking and reminisces of the Golden Age with a touch of working-class bashing which may leave a small number of its modern audience nonplussed.",

It defines cinema at its finest. All the genres, from drama to thriller and from romance to politics, the tone fluctuates like never before and still remains persistent like always before. The conversations between Brando and Marie Saint does spark romance. The anticipated qualifications for the equations to move forward as the story enfolds ought to be convincing and is delivered thoroughly in here with gripping screenplay. One of the primary strength of the feature is its ferocious pace, leaping from one sequence to another, each moment is a pure delight.Blending it all in, the huge cast, high pitched dramatic sequences, complex relationship, morality conflicts and a vital message, all wrapped up in an envelope, this is as cinematic as the cinema can be. And since it fiddles with multiple characters, it has to and does offer each of them a moment to stand alone and factor in effectively. The priest, the antagonist and the protagonist, each of them has something to say and Kazan gives them the stage an actor always aspires for. Brando as a troubled complex guy seeking his voice fabricates his performance with power and vulnerability to appear more human and welcoming host to its audience.It is definitely one of the best performance of his life and supporting him all the way is a great cast like Malden as a bratty king with the crown and Marie Saint as the love affair and the inner voice of Brando. Kazan's neat and clean vision of street gangster's is more lethal than Scorsese's in here. On The Waterfront is clearly a film ahead of its time and it has managed to keep us busy and electrified even after decades.",

The way the film explores the dialogues and interpretive skills of the cast is the best it has: the actors have excellent material and were brilliantly directed by Elia Kazan. The result is evident: a film that is a work of art and a piece of culture and memory, which won eight Oscars at that time (Best Film, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Black-and-White Cinematography, Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Editing), which is always an achievement.The story is very interesting and revolves around the control that a small group of criminals have over a New York dockers' union: after the murder of a docker, young ex-boxer Terry Malloy begins to distance himself from the mob boss Johnny Friendly and, greatly encouraged by Father Barry, chooses to denounce what is happening to the authorities, aware that he will pay the consequences.The strongest point of the film is its excellent story, and the eloquent and excellent way in which the cast worked and performed, reinforced by memorable and extremely high quality dialogues. The film is full of quotes worth mentioning and anthological moments, such as the great and tense dialogue between Terry and Friendly in the back of the taxi or Terry's suffering and pain-filled walk, even in the final part of the film. I have always said that a good story and capable actors are the key to making a great film, and \"On The Waterfront\" is proof of my idea: without artifices, effects and decorations, it focus on the essential things and get everything it want.The great cast is excellently directed by Kazan, who achieved with this film one of the most impressive and remarkable works of his career as a director. Marlon Brando is a good actor and achieves stardom with this film, where he was still far from the roles of the sunset of his career. Lee J. Cobb is very good in the role of mobster: discreet, he gave the character a personality that swings dangerously and quickly between sympathy and brutality. Eva Marie Saint is extremely effective in her role, although the film is poorly tailored for female characters and she appears only to be the love interest of Brando and the sister of the dead docker. Karl Malden brings to life the most human and most influential character in the entire film: a Catholic priest who does not shy away from using the pulpit to fight what he believes to be evil and wicked, even if he eventually has to suffer.Technically, it is an extremely discreet film. There are no visual or special effects that go far beyond the most basic. The cinematography, in black and white, is very good and is loaded with a very welcome elegance. The sets and costumes are equally good and are in accordance with the period, the environment and the social context. The soundtrack is not particularly impressive, but bets on elegant and pleasant enough jazz themes.",

Schulberg’s writings covered a curious variety of topicsBud Schulberg’s hard-hitting story and screenplay were destined to become an instant hit and in the directorial hands of craftsman, Elia Kazan was turned into a worldwide phenomenon. Schulberg’s writings covered a curious variety of topics from corruption within the fight game ‘The Harder They Fall’  to the plunder of bird plumage in ‘Wind Across the Everglades’ - even taking a serious shot at Media and the promotion of corrupt charlatans as ‘hero’s’ with ‘A face In The Crowd’.  In his early war years, Schulberg also gathered evidence for the Nuremberg trials - not one to hold back on the trail of inhuman activities.  Adding immeasurably to the power of ‘Waterfront’ were the towering talents of Composer Leonard Bernstein - creating a haunting musical soundscape that gave life to the settings and soul-searching torment of its characters. Performances, guided by Kazan, were career cementing for Brando, Eva Marie Saint (introducing), and Karl Malden, along with a hand-picked cast of powerhouse support players all destined for solid careers.  The violence portrayed within this picture was not simply sensationalistic, as it was for many that tried to copy ‘waterfront’ but rather to make a statement against violence, in an effort to bring justice into a corrupt institution.  It still packs a wallop today as it did 70yrs ago. Boris Kaufman’s striking B/W cinematography (‘Patterns’ 56) adds considerable visual power. The Columbia DVD features a good image and sound transfer and I see it has since been remastered in HD.",
