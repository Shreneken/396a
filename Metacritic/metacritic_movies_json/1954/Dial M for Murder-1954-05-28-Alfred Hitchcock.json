  "critic_reviews": [
    "The thrills come in following a succession of dawnings in people's minds.But Mr. Hitchcock has presented this mental material on the screen with remarkable visual definition of developing intrigue and mood.",
    "If the things here are homelier and less loved than, say, Marnie's neon yellow purse or Cary Grant's glowing glass of milk, and the film itself no one's idea of major Hitch, it remains a fascinating investigation of a stillborn process from one of cinema's most dedicated inquisitors of structure.",
    "The result is a rather stagey film whose back projections look quaint, with 3D apparently used to foreground items of furniture, such as table-lamps, giving rise to some eccentric camera-angles. But the set-up is ingenious and the \"kill\" scene genuinely thrilling. [2013 3D Release]",
    "Dial M is starred with fine scenes and good performances. Though played as contemporary melodrama, it somehow manages to reflect the gaslight magic of turn-of-the-century London.",
    "Its trick is to generate considerable suspense while withholding nothing from the audience. Its pleasures are not profound ones, but there’s enough dimensionality up on the screen to compensate. [2013 3D Release]",
    "What tends to make even lesser Hitchcock films shine is his innate gift for directing performers, and this accounts for many of the pleasures of this ditty.",
    "Lower case Hitch, but diverting and sleek, with the climax early on.  [review of original release]",
    "The screenplay tends to constrain rather than liberate Hitchcock's thematic thrust, but there is much of technical value in his geometric survey of the scene and the elaborate strategies employed to transfer audience sympathy among the four main characters.",
    "Despite Hitchcock's own reservations this is definitely worth a look. Interesting to his aficionados and darkly funny and depressing in turns.",
    "There are a number of basic weaknesses in the setup that keep the picture from being a good suspense show for any but the most gullible. Via the performances and several suspense tricks expected of Hitchcock, the weaknesses are glossed over but not enough to rate the film a cinch winner."

While not his best, Dial M For Murder has so much to recommend it. First of all, is the breathtaking cinematography, which is nearly always the best thing in a Hitchcock film. The script is a gem, showing that you are capable of anything, and most of the time, it is very tense and rarely slips. That said, my only complaint, is that one or two scenes such as the ending do fall flat, compared to the rest of the film. However, the film also has a wonderful music score, and fantastic performances from the entire cast. Ray Milland, an actor I really want to get more familiar with, is excellent as Tony Wendice, the husband planning to murder his wife, and make it a perfect murder. As Margot, the beautiful Grace Kelly is the picture of beauty and vulnerability in a wonderful understated performance, perhaps outshining her co-star. Everyone else acquitted themselves well too, even Robert Cummings as Mark Halliday and John Williams as Inspector Hubbard. Overall, an excellent film, not Hitchcock's best, but well looking out for. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",

And maybe, only because he never lets it loseWhat is told repetitively, what is romanticized, what is pure, is the final trick.Dial M For MurderAlfred Hitchcock is a great adapter. From books to plays, his adaptation is simply ingenious. And maybe, only because he never lets it lose the essence of where it comes from. What the source is. Which then of course can be argued as both an advantage or a disastrous disadvantage. And Dial M For Murder suffers the same consequences that Rope does. The play is written with very few scenes in mind. Scenes with long conversations in mind and long conversation that swoops in every behind the stage activity occurring both before and after the sequence. It can be a bit cheesy, fortunately it is not here.And this is how Hitchcock dodges all the social rigmarole that a structure of this film comes with. More than 90% of the film is staged in one set piece only. The hall, the main room, the entrance room of this murderous apartment. So why do we despite knowing all these issues that are about to come, still fall for its topsy turvy script. Only because, Hitchcock frames exactly what the audience is going through. That is why he is still loved. Even decades later, his films are satisfying.Walking in on the murder mystery film, every audience member appoints itself to be the detective of the case, the film. And what all it, the audience, wants to do is analyse every last detail of that crime scene. And Hitchcock gives them exactly what they want. Split into three acts, the first act is the planning of that crime scene. The second is the crime scene going wrong just as it was planned and was to be narrated to the executioners. And the third is justifying the wrong doers deed. And it is a finale in the sense that we aren't told how this will go down unlike the previous acts.",

She's married, but ends up having an affair with Mark Halliday, an American writer of detective novels. Therefore, and to avoid giving up her fortune, Tom decides to murder her but his plan goes wrong and Margo kills, in self-defense, the man who would kill her. Tom, to avoid the risk of being discovered, quickly creates a plan to take his wife to be sentenced to death.Directed by the great Alfred Hitchcock (one of the most brilliant directors of all time), this film, like others he directed (\"Rear Window,\" \"Psycho\", \"The Rope\" etc.), is based on a police investigation, and the dramatic tension of the plot resides in its development, putting the audience in expectation, waiting to see when the killer will be unmasked in their eagerness to try to save himself. That's a formula that Hitchcock used so often in his movies that it's difficult today to see this movie and don't feel that disappointment of those who expected something more, or something different. Nevertheless, this movie is good, is very well done and has a great cast (headed by Grace Kelly, Ray Milland and Robert Cummings, respectively in the role of Margot, Tony and Mark Halliday) toasting the audience with great interpretations. The technical aspects (photography, soundtrack etc.) also seems faultless.\"Dial M for Murder\" is a film that already has a few years, and probably we've already seen it on the small screen. Despite this, and despite not being one of the best films of this director and being totally unable to cause us astonishment or surprise, it's a nice movie to see, or review.",

It takes time to figure out what is happening. Second, the conclusion part was little bit confusing to understand.
