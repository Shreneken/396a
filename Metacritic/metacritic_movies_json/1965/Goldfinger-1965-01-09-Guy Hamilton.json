    "critic_reviews": [
        "Of all the Bonds, Goldfinger is the best, and can stand as a surrogate for the others. If it is not a great film, it is a great entertainment, and contains all the elements of the Bond formula that would work again and again.",
        "Not just my favourite Bond movie, but the standard by which all other Bond movies must be judged. It has Sean Connery, of course, and the best theme song, incorporating Shirley Bassey and lashings of John Barry brass...And it has the best villain.",
        "Larger than life, faintly ridiculous, completely cool, Goldfinger is the quintessential James Bond movie.",
        "It's phenomenal! A rare case in film history that a series projecting the same character, with the same star, improves as it goes along. The James Bond movies do. The first, \"Dr. No,\" was good; the second, \"From Russia With Love,\" was better; the best and the wildest is Goldfinger, a fun galore thriller that is one of the brightest lights of the holiday offerings on screens of De Mille and Coronet Theatres.",
        "Goldfinger contains more crowd-pleasing moments than any other Bond film, including Oddjob's flying bowler, a laser beam that almost emasculates Bond, the lavishly accessorized Aston Martin DB5, and the bizarre murder of Goldfinger's secretary (Shirley Eaton): she's gilded to death. It also features Shirley Bassey's terrific rendition of the Leslie Bricusse-Anthony Newley title song.",
        "There's not the least sign of staleness in this third sample of the Bond 007 formula. Some liberties have been taken with Ian Fleming's original novel but without diluting its flavor.",
        "This 1964 entry is the most enjoyable of the James Bond thrillers starring Sean Connery\u2014perhaps because it's the most comic and cartoony in look as well as conception. Still, it's every bit as imperialist and misogynistic as the other screen adventures based on Ian Fleming's books.",
        "A bit much? Yes, but it's meant to be. Like Doctor No and From Russia with Love, the two previous Bond bombshells, this picture is a thriller exuberantly travestied. No doubt Goldfinger's formula for box-office gold contains entirely too much brass, but who cares? In scene after scene Director Guy Hamilton has contrived some hilariously horrible sight gags.",
        "Goldfinger is studded with moments that have since become deeply embedded in the Bond mythos. John Barry's opening song (sung by Shirley Bassey) is among the series' best. Snippets of dialogue have attained an almost-legendary status, such as the exchange when Goldfinger is about to emasculate 007 with a laser. \"Do you expect me to talk?\" asks Bond. The response is succinct: \"No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!\"",
        "It holds the attention of the audience from brazen start to fantastic finish \u2013 well, not quite to the silly end, perhaps, but then we can\u2019t have everything.",
        "Any kid growing up in the early \u201960s will remember this one for several reasons: Birley Shassey\u2019s screamer of a theme; Bond\u2019s shocking use of a beautiful girl as a human shield; bullion-obsessed baddie Auric Goldfinger\u2019s top hat-wielding henchman, Oddjob; Honor Blackman\u2019s risquely monikered Pussy Galore; and, above all, Bond\u2019s stupendous, gadget-infested silver Aston Martin DB5, the car that spurred a thousand Corgi purchases.",
        "What they give us in Goldfinger is an excess of  science-fiction fun, a mess of mechanical melodrama, and a minimum of bedroom farce...It is good fun, all right, fast and furious, racing hither and yon about the world as Double-Oh Seven pursues the intrigues of a mysterious financier named Goldfinger."

I watched these 25 movies with a friend, spent dozens of hours of watching and discussingHaving watched 25 Bonds from Dr.No to Spectre, and having posted a review on each and every one of these movies, I can finally place Goldfinger at N\u00b01. I watched these 25 movies with a friend, spent dozens of hours of watching and discussing all of them with him, and took so many hours putting down my thoughts on Metacritic to free my brain from all the Bonds.And I still, since my childhood where I first saw it, do not change my opinion one tiny bit: Goldfinger is the peak, the masterpiece, the absolute and ultimate expression of what James Bond was all about.Goldfinger is a masterpiece of Bond in so many ways, that words sort of fail me. By today's expectations of what a movie should be, lots of people would call it a bad movie, in the sense that Bond movies are self-indulgent, escapist fantasies about a man with some life experience but before middle-age (Sean Connery was 34 when he shot this movie), who travels the world, smacks girls' butts, has sex with ease, humiliates other (evil) men, kills other men but never gets hurt badly himself, and says cheesy lines every other sentence. By today's standards, many would just call it camp and move on.But it is also an absolutely glorious movie, where the banter and mind games are incredibly memorable, the lines are glorious, the villain is so memorable and grows on you, from a fat, balding, ridiculous man to a mastermind of evil, the fights are just as much made in one's mind, as in fists, guns, and cars, gadgets and techno-madness, and victory is gained as much through all of those as it is gained through Bond's magic c*ck which wins him the villain's main girl over to the good guys. It's a movie that epitomises the term FUN, without muddling it with obscene amounts of action or comic relief. It shines at being made by and for adults, while being just as fun as a kids cartoon. Goldfinger embodies the Bond style so much, it hasn't been equaled as a Bond movie, as an adults fun movie, even 50 years later. It may never be equaled.It's an entirely and thoroughly Bond movie, with all the good and the bad to its paroxysm. It's to the point that I can only say this: if you have never watched a classic James Bond, watch Goldfinger. Nothing else matters. Like it or hate it, there is no Bond more Bond.Bond movies often shine, or do not, due to their main villain. Goldfinger cements that by giving what is still today the best Bond villain by far.Bond movies often delve into more or less good taste action & romance, that nonetheless are fun at the end of the day. Goldfinger gives us the most, good or bad, but the strongest taste.Bond movies can and should be this unique mix of fun, action, banter, mind games, sex, death, natural virility and suave charm. Goldfinger gives us the most of that.It's simply THE Bond movie. It's simply a masterpiece. Even outside of being a Bond fan, it's a gloriously enjoyable, charming, and memorable movie, full of so many great lines, scenes, and moments, that there is no way to forget it. It's a movie of an era, a movie that crowns itself the highest of a very long series, and a movie that influenced cinema perhaps more than any of the movies that will end up on a \"100 best movies of all time\" lists. Watch it for leisure, watch it for Bond, watch it for its historical value.",

It was a huge success, became the blueprint and benchmark for all following movies while also having some of the most memorable scenes in the franchise. For me the strength are the characters and the story that compliment each other. Story: After destroying a drug laboratory James Bond is on a mission to investigate Auric Goldfinger. He is one of the richest man in the world with countless talents and an obsession for gold. As you can imagine there is more to him as his official persona will tell you (It would not be a James Bond movie otherwise ;-). More I wont spoil. The story is great with good ideas and twists. It is also a case were the bad guy has a remarkable well thought out plan. There is the book \u201cShaken, not Stirred! James Bond in the Spotlight of Physics\u201d from Metin Tolan and Joachim Stolze. In it they analyze various ideas and scenes from many James Bond movies. The conclusion for the final plan in Goldfinger is that it is doable and mostly scientifically accurate (There are other problems however that will make it hard to do). Another scene was even analyzed by the Mythbusters as it became pop-culture knowledge. It has so many remarkable scenes that transcended the movie. Each fan knows what I mean (Painting, laser, hat, timer etc.). Then there are the actors. Lets start with Gert Fr\u00f6be as Auric Goldfinger. He set the benchmark for a James Bond villains. He is clever, a good schemer and a diabolical gentleman who enjoys what he does. With Harold Sakata as Oddjob we have a remarkable lieutenant. He is not a man of many words but absolute dangerous. There is a remarkable man behind the actor. He was a weightlifter (silver medal at Olympics!), successful wrestler and actor. Of cause we have Sean Connery as James Bond and many said this is his best performance. Shirley Eaton has only a shorter role but a golden one that is unforgotten even today ;-). The rest of the cast also delivers a good performance. They also started the friendly unfriendliness between Q and James Bond (Both like each other and would put their life on the line to save the other). We got here the interesting homing beacon and the legendary Aston Martin DB5. Then there are the good sets and soundtrack. Shirley Bassey made the title song and had a hit with it. She was chosen to made two other title songs for other James Bond movies. The rest is also pretty good but less remembered. Overall this was the movie that made James Bond a hit. In today's currency the movie would have made over 900 million dollars. It has great actors and an enjoyable story with great moments. Rarely it is not in the top 3 for the favorite James Bond movies and it deserves it. For me a highlight of the series and the best James Bond movie.",

As much as I love Dr.No and From Russia with Love, I think Goldfinger is a serious contender for the best Bond film ever.For me Goldfinger is the slickest of the Bond films in terms of how the stunts are performed and how the story is told. The story mayn't be the most exciting of all the Bonds, but it is still very gripping. The direction is sly, the cinematography is stylish, the locations are stunning and I can never get enough of the theme song sung by Shirley Bassey.The script is sophisticated and humorous, while James Bond is still his suave and charismatic self, **** Galore is fabulously sexy and Auric Goldfinger himself ties with Blofeld as the best Bond villain, and a deliciously bizarre one he is too, being obsessed with gold and everything.Other than the theme song and Goldfinger, the action is what makes this film. I love the gadget designs which are wonderfully over-the-top, while my favourite scenes include Shirley Eaton's legendary gold-plated death, the duel with the bowler-hatted sidekick Oddjob and the midair showdown between Bond and Goldfinger.The acting is superb. Sean Connery gives his best performance as the character of Bond, although Connery is the master of suavity and charisma he is even more suave and charismatic here. Honor Blackman is sexy and enthusiastic as **** Galore, while Gert Frobe is amazing as Goldfinger. Overall, a golden treasure and a serious contender for the best ever Bond. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

He sees what this character is and how to portray it on screen to its best. And with finesse like his, the content subverts the flaws or inadequacies of the plotline and embraces the super-ness of the characters in this sketchy world. Finally, after two long chapters, the finest quality of this franchise, i.e. its antagonist, is magnified to an almost parallel role in this chapter. And carrying the title and the fear of his name, the snidy villain to Connery is perpetually playing a long tennis game with him.An ace for an ace and a set for a set, if Sean Connery has gadgets in his pocket, Gert Frobe has a contingency plan in his mind, to every reply he has a counter argument that desimmates Connery's view for a whole act. Even in its last act, he never, mind you, never for a split second accepts his lose, at its most vulnerable point, he throws an equally challenging punch to our Martini-consumer host. One of the primary reason how the sense of urgency is kept alive throughout this two hours of journey, is the bluffs of Connery and Frobe's that are called out up front.And with almost an entire film, Connery spending under Frobe's shade, his cloaking or more accurately stripping of the revisited character has made to be \"out of touch\", in fact, he doesn't even get to say his name, \"Bond, James..\". The director Guy Hamilton brings less verbal sparrings in the script this time, which to be frankly seems like of barely twenty pages. Relying completely upon complex and witty physical sequences like an escape from a prison to stalling while shaving, these quiet moments on screen haunts us for the rest of the film, with not a monsterous face but a Goldfinger.",

This was written before the show devolved into a hideous mockery of itself, so Ian Fleming would have recognised it. Well, Sean Connery is Sean Connery. There isn't really anything left to say that hasn't been stated. Honor Blackman, who plays **** Galore, and the whole of the supporting cast deserve praise. (I merely needed a reason to type that!) Both Shirley Eaton and Tania Mallet, who played the Masterson sisters, and Lois Maxwell, who played Miss Moneypenny, were exceptionally attractive. Gert Frobe's portrayal of Goldfinger was appropriately sinister. The Oddjob character was a little startling and superfluous, as well as a sign of the destruction to come in the following movies.",
