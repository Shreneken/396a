    "critic_reviews": [
        "A harrowing, gruesome, morbid tale of war, so compelling in its realism, bigness and repulsiveness that Universal\u2019s Western Front becomes at once a money picture.",
        "Anti-war statements of the cinema in the subsequent 80 years have occasionally surpassed Lewis Milestone\u2019s technically and artistically groundbreaking film, but few can match it for relentless despair or elemental fury\u2014both on and off the battlefield.",
        "Perhaps the greatest antiwar film ever made, holding considerable power even now due to Lewis Milestone's inventive direction.",
        "Despite a little dating around the edges this is a truly superb example of its genre and a cinema classic.",
        "All Quiet on the Western Front remains an essential piece of social history and a heart-wrenching film.",
        "Milestone\u2019s visual style lacks the flourish of Wellman\u2019s Wings, but it\u2019s no less explicit, as the camera pans across battlefields where dismembered body parts hang from barbed wire.",
        "It is the most thoroughgoing expos\u00e9 of the absurdity of war, and the most explicitly pacifist movie ever made.",
        "Often the scenes are of such excellence that if they were not audible one might believe that they were actual motion pictures of activities behind the lines, in the trenches and in No Man's Land.",
        "Lewis Milestone's powerful 1930 adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's antiwar novel, starring Lew Ayres and Louis Wolheim, deserves its reputation as a classic.",
        "All Quiet on the Western Front is the definitive World War I motion picture, the best of a surprisingly small class of movies.",
        "Lewis Milestone's unsparing direction of the senseless slaughter more than makes up for the soft spots and does justice to Erich Maria Remarque's novel of a generation destroyed by war.",
        "The film's strength now derives less from its admittedly powerful but highly simplistic utterances about war as waste, than from a generally excellent set of performances (Ayres especially) and an almost total reluctance to follow normal plot structure.",
        "An ambitious epic of tremendous sweep and scope, with trench-warfare battle scenes comparable to Kubrick's Paths of Glory."

Honestly, though, the mature, ahead-of-its-time thematic statement was one of the only reasons I ended up liking this movie as much as I did. I understand that, in the 30's, this was still a blossoming medium, with a lot of filmmaking techniques still in their prototypical phases. But damn it, man. Some of the acting in this is just so hammy, overly thespian, and plain bad. I can't help but dock points for it. Especially when other pre-Code films that I happen to really enjoy (\"Scarface,\" \"The Champ,\" etc.) appear to excel in this regard. Still though, the ideas are clear, concise, and almost anachronistically potent, featuring a series of narrative events that really help to sell an overall sense of meaningful sadness. I just wish those events were staged and performed with a bit more consistency.",

Both media are true classics and were banned back then in GermanyA magnificent movie that captures the grim reality of war. It is based on the book of the same name from German author Erich Maria Remarque who actually served in World War 1. Both media are true classics and were banned back then in Germany as Hitler and the Nazi party were on the rise to power. Remarque had to leave Germany, his citizenship nullified and he would be executed if the Nazis got him. By the way: As an enteral shame for Germany no one in the government after World War 2 attempted to reinstall his citizenship. The movie is well crafted and delivers a timeless message. The story is set in World War 1. At school Professor Kantorek gives his near graduation class a passionate speech about the glory, honor and bravery to serve the fatherland in the army. Impressed by this the whole class led by Paul B\u00e4umer enlist in the army. They become members of the second company and are sent to the battlefields of the war. The cruel and grim reality of war will catch up to them. The story is absolutely great. It completely destroys the illusions and fairy tales about war. For those who do not know or did no research: World War 1 was a nightmare. The war was stagnant as no side could overwhelm the enemy. It became a meat grinder and trench warfare that wasted so many lives. Hundreds of thousands were send to their dead by ignorant leaders. Sabaton made a great song with \u201cThe Price of a Mile\u201d that also captures this waste of lives. Back to the review. It shows ruthless the suffering of the boys. It is dirty, grim, merciless and futility. The emotions and imagery are praiseworthy. In addition the great cast adds a lot to this. Lew Ayres as Paul B\u00e4umer is mayor impressive. He delivers the full emotional impact of the role. Arnold Lucy as Professor Kantorek has just a smaller role but was so good I remember him today. Also remarkable are William Bakewell as Albert Kropp, Ben Alexander as Franz Kemmerich and Louis Wolheim as Stanislaus (Kat) Katczinsky. A truly great cast that improves the movie. I already praised the visuals and repeat that all sets look amazing. It enhances the atmosphere and seem real. The rest is history. It received the Oscar for the best movie and was forbidden in Germany by the Nazis. The latter is an indicator how good and truthful it was. The movie became a timeless classic and is still often in the best movie list of all times. Not in the top 10 but near always in the top 100. In Germany where I live it is standard to watch this movie in school. Overall this is a timeless classic and a must see for everyone. I recommend this movie for education alone.",
