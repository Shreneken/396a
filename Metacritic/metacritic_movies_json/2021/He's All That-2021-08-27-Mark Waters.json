  "summary": "He's All That reimagines the original plot of the 1999 teen classic She’s All That. The contemporary story follows an influencer (Addison Rae) who accepts a challenge to turn the school’s biggest loser (Tanner Buchanan) into prom king.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Helmed by Mark Waters (Mean Girls, 2003’s Freaky Friday) and with a script from R. Lee Fleming Jr., the screenwriter behind the original movie, He’s All That is one of the best high-school romantic comedies in recent history. It uses the old movie’s makeover template to carve out a romantic story that hits all the satisfying beats, turning turns them into something refreshing… and actually better than the original movie.",
    "It is a sweet little end of summer sorbet with appealing young performers and a script that refreshes the original without overdoing it.",
    "Addison Rae and Tanner Buchanan are magnetic leads in this reboot that pays homage to the first film, but fully stands on its own. It manages to cut through modern high school b.s. while transforming two posers into presentable, likable people.",
    "You’ll be pleased to discover the entertaining remake has its charms; it actually is all that, for the most part.",
    "He’s All That may be a flattened reflection of its predecessor, but both films are charming enough to get away with about one anal sex innuendo joke apiece.",
    "Directed by Mark Waters, cast members seem to operate on the belief that they can best deal with the plot’s improbabilities by grimacing their way through and not giving anyone time to react to them. Pesky details brushed aside, the film can play to its strength, which is the charm of its leads.",
    "This movie is pure cotton candy — sweet and brightly colored and a bit of a guilty pleasure, but it’s not intended to be something you can sink your teeth into, and five minutes after consuming it, it’s like it never happened.",
    "While it’s possible to make the formulaic and familiar resound fantastically, that concept has evaded these filmmakers here. Neither bland regurgitation nor innovative retelling, the remake falls somewhere in between, suffering greatly by not establishing a more distinctive identity.",
    "Hot people pretending to be homely is par for the course in makeover movies; the real thrill lies in watching opposites attract. But the catfights, confessions, and dance-offs in He’s All That lack the sting of real romantic conflict, and there’s nary a spark between Rae and Buchanan.",
    "The intentions were probably noble, but the execution not so much.",
    "It’s the same feeling, really, as watching a bunch of straight TikToks. While Rae offers flashes of promise, especially when she pops her genuinely winning smile, she doesn’t make the case for TikTok-to-film-stardom here. The chemistry between her and Buchanan is stilted, at best.",
    "Undemanding movie-goers on the lookout for a movie featuring pretty people in a vapid rom-com that might find this movie to their liking. For everyone else, this is decidedly not “all that.”",
    "But the charm is thin and the laughs hard to find in this iteration. Aside from a little nostalgia for the middling film this is based on, He’s All That just isn’t all that.",
    "Despite some clever, winking nods to the original, including appearances by Cook herself and Matthew Lillard, He’s All That fails to deliver on what She’s All That did so well: a sweet, lighthearted romance that hinges on the chemistry between its two leads.",
    "Manufactured for the ‘Kissing Booth’ crowd, this gender-swapped, TikTok-friendly update of the 1999 teen hit sounds awful and it often is, but enough charm pokes through the cracks  to sucker anyone who ever fell for a makeover fable.",
    "He's All That is a hollow Gen Z recreation of She's All That, lacking in charm and seemingly engineered as a vehicle to promote its stars' other work.",
    "Water’s film is merely bland, a boring hodgepodge of Gen-Z references and a workmanlike script that never seems to understand what it’s trying to say.",
    "Despite the efforts of a bright young cast, this is a hollow and depressing Gen Z romantic comedy. What’s even scarier is that this film comes from Mark Waters, the director of “Mean Girls,” a way savvier teen satire that doesn’t pander to its audience.",
    "There’s nothing inherently wrong with the idea of a teen rom-com centered on social media popularity and influencer culture—even one that doesn’t necessarily see those things as evil. But He’s All That offers nothing beyond buzzwords, empty platitudes, and sponcon.",
    "It might be just as well that Padgett is not given a real emotional arc, nor anything resembling an internal life. Even when little is asked of her, Rae's acting is not up to the challenge.",
    "In the end, He’s All That is not all that — not even a little bit of that.",
    "He’s All That is, yes, a nightmarish, joyless commentary on influencer-beholden adolescence told through the crutch of nostalgia and starring a charisma-less TikTok star, but it’s hard to know if one is merely an example of “Old Man Yells at Cloud” or if the teenagers of today are truly living in a Hell on Earth"

It's supposed to be an \"upgrade\" to the original 1999 movie \"she's all that\" but i watched the trailer of the movie and it looks much better than this movie. If you like romcoms you shouldn't watch this movie and just try finding another one or just watch \"she's all that\" instad of this movie. I found so many issues with this movie while watching it and it felt like i was watching for 3h when i only was half way through the movie (around 50 min). Please save your time by not watching this movie. It's like watching a bunch of tiktok's one after another one and if they want to make a movie based on social media and romcoms including that they could do it better, and i think it could even be a good idea, but honestly this movie is just straight up garbage (and i'm a 16 year old thinking this)",

This time an Insta influencer (Addison Rae) takes on the project of turning one of her high school’s apparent losers (Tanner Buchanan) into a hottie. Since this is essentially based on Pygmalion, you know how it’ll go down, so the challenge is getting there. Rae seems slightly artificial (but that may be the character), but Buchanan makes a charming, sexy romantic interest. Actors in the original, Rachael Leigh Cook and Matthew Lillard make appearances (his turn is one of the comic highlights). Otherwise, there aren’t any especially kooky or fun supporting characters and nothing about it is anything but expected. An upbeat but very teen romance.",
