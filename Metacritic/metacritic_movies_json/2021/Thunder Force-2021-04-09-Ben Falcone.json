    "critic_reviews": [
        "Thunder Force is another of McCarthy\u2019s collaborations with her partner, Ben Falcone (who has a small role), and bears all the effortless likability of a well-oiled machine, which cannot help but feel like a real limit on what McCarthy et. al. are capable of while also making a great case for how watchable these actors are when they lean in to being a little washed, a little lo-fi.",
        "Thunder Force drags until roughly its last third, and then something remarkable happens: its gonzo spirit kicks in. From that point on, Thunder Force feels crazily, joltingly alive, as if it were realizing, a little too late, that it ought to have been a different movie altogether.",
        "This shaggy superhero spoof doesn\u2019t consistently live up to its best moments, but at least those moments are there, with most of them stemming from the hilarious interplay between McCarthy and Octavia Spencer.",
        "Good-natured, soft-hearted, a little lazy, and propelledby the relentless charisma of Melissa McCarthy when all else fails, this Netflix production makes for cozy pandemic at-home viewing with scant thrills but a couple of genuinely funny moments.",
        "Better than My Super-Ex Girlfriend, sloppier than Hancock, it\u2019s nothing dynamic but fun all the same. And frankly, not every superhero flick or comedy needs to be the Super-person of its domain. Likability is sometimes an underrated super-power, and Thunder Force is bursting with it.",
        "It\u2019s hard to tell what this movie is trying to be, and end the end just kind of becomes just another superhero movie, despite Jason Bateman\u2019s best attempts at preventing that. I swear, someday, someone will nail one of these premises.",
        "The likability of Lydia and Emily helps, but writer-director Ben Falcone\u2019s tendency to milk emotion that isn\u2019t there drags down the movie and some of the comic bits feel obvious and pushed.",
        "The movie comes to life any time the actors are given space to mess around. It's just not enough to hold the whole thing together.",
        "With such powerhouses as McCarthy and Spencer at the helm, it's a surprise that so much of the film is inert, rote, conventional.",
        "In general le cin\u00e9ma de Falcone is not a pretty (or hilarious) thing. Thunder Force is, at best, more a light chuckler than a laugher.",
        "While McCarthy and Spencer do their damndest to make the family-friendly feature work \u2014 McCarthy in particular brings real texture to her charming slacker with a heart of gold, a role she\u2019s played so many times before \u2014 Thunder Force isn\u2019t clever enough to break new ground in the superhero milieu, nor is it silly enough to mine its material for the kind of jokes that would make it distinctive.",
        "Thunder Force is only occasionally insightful, and almost never surprising. It\u2019s arriving in a world where people generally expect more from its genre than light, enjoyable performances and a handful of overstretched gags, and that\u2019s all it has to offer.",
        "Overall, the comedy in Thunder Force is apathetic and airless, no matter how hard McCarthy tries.",
        "Thunder Force has too good of a core idea to be left so unexplored. Melissa McCarty can\u2019t be stopped, but she continues to be content making films that leave her talent frustratingly untapped.",
        "With its bland positivity (regular people can be superheroes!), flimsy-bordering-on-indifferent plotting and Post-it-note-deep characters, that leaves the bits and shtick to buoy Falcone's screenplay. They're hit-and-miss, but it's definitely the off-track digressions where the film sparks to life.",
        "With a super-spoof that\u2019s occasionally funny but always forgettable, the Melissa McCarthy-verse falls flat at Phase One.",
        "Spencer and McCarthy are the superheroes we deserve, but are capable of so much more than bowel-movement jokes in this tepid and formulaic buddy romp.",
        "Its leading ladies are in fine form, as always, and they're backed by some lively performers. It's the story that struggles to come through, along with a reluctance to just let loose in every way possible.",
        "Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer have sparkling screen presence, but can\u2019t thrive under Ben Falcone\u2019s utter lack of vision. Thunder Force doesn\u2019t work as a superhero movie or a buddy comedy, as it refuses to revel in the big moments of either.",
        "This is by-the-numbers stuff, not quite funny enough for comedy or having enough of the crazed seriousness that marks out a successful superhero franchise.",
        "But there\u2019s so much done wrong as the film tries to be funny that when it is funny, the funniness goes down like a bitter pill: Why can\u2019t it be good all the time?",
        "It\u2019s always a shame when a group of talented humans get together and deliver something that comes across as a halfhearted effort, even if they poured their blood, sweat and tears into it.",
        "Watching Thunder Force, it\u2019s baffling to remember that this is Falcone\u2019s fifth film as a director. There\u2019s a convenience store fight so ineptly staged I had to watch it three times to decipher what was happening, and running gags that aren\u2019t funny the first time and grow worse with every repetition.",
        "Despite the best efforts of McCarthy, and a winsome Spencer as her sidekick, Thunder Force is more like Shazam! Lite. It wants us to laugh at genre tropes, but this crude and unoriginal dreck is just comedy Kryptonite.",
        "With the exception of a few demented scenes teleported over from a stranger, better comedy . . . Thunder Force is as sloppy and disappointing as the label \u201cA Ben Falcone Film\u201d previously suggested.",
        "Belly-flopping into the superhero movie pool, Thunder Force illustrates what happens when filmmakers take a moderately interesting premise and surround it with witless writing, cringe-inducing acting, stagnant action, humor-deprived comedy, and feckless drama.",
        "Bad characters? Check! Well-worn, uninventive plot? Check! Forced physical comedy? Check! A big-budget and no oversight? Check! Put all of that together, and what do you get? Another bad Netflix comedy from the makers of other bad comedies. Sorry, McCarthy and Spencer, but you\u2019re better than this.",
        "This comedy misfire starring  McCarthy and Spencer as unlikely superheroes is hardly a crime against cinema. It just a bumpy road to blah in which the actors  look to be having a way better time than you will. That\u2019s messed up.",
        "Thunder Force is at least an equal-opportunities bummer: It doesn\u2019t work as a superhero adventure or a midlife reclamation movie or a mismatched buddy comedy or a family entertainment unless your aim is to disappoint all members of the family equally.",
        "Thunder Force doesn\u2019t work as a comedy, but that\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t really work as a movie. There\u2019s so little chemistry between McCarthy and Spencer, longtime real-life friends, that, rather than buddies, their characters often just come across as mildly surprised to find themselves in the same room.",
        "A comedic dud that's aptly titled, since it makes loud noises without really needing to be seen. The one thing unlikely to be heard during this Netflix superhero spoof is a whole lot of laughter.",
        "Thunder Force, the latest in a string of dismal comic collaborations between Melissa McCarthy and her husband, Ben Falcone, does nothing to improve upon its predecessors.",
        "Thunder Force is at least an equal-opportunities bummer: It doesn\u2019t work as a superhero adventure or a midlife reclamation movie or a mismatched buddy comedy or a family entertainment unless your aim is to disappoint all members of the family equally.",
        "It\u2019s a tedious mess to endure and seemed like way more fun making than watching."

Give it a try, you might like it, but probably won't.McCarthy and Spencer have no chemistry. That may be in large part do to Octavia absolutely phoning in this performance. She's a FAR better actor than she is in this. 1/3 in and still no fights or laughs, which as an \"action comedy\" you'd kind of expect. McCarthy does her best, but her FAT-LADY-FALL-DOWN running gag stopped being funny a long time ago. The film also has a serious issue with logic too. The \"miscreants\" that get powers activated are also violent psychopaths... okay, but that doesn't really explain why they're a problem? Like, they have powers sure, but it's not like they're bulletproof. Why can't the police just, you know, shoot them. The movie is full of logical inconsistencies like this.The costume design is also, let's be real, is just terrible.A lot of people in these reviews are very much coming from dishonest people who straight up do not want movies staring plus size women and women of colour. The reality is though... it's just bad. It's just really, REALLY bad.",

This film was all I needed to determine that McCarthy's career may very well take a nose dive if she doesn't start dipping her feet into some untried waters! She's getting older, and we can see her aging in this film. She's gotta try something new.",

He\u2019s helmed most of the recent films starring his wife Melissa McCarthy and they\u2019ve all been mediocre. This one co-stars Octavia Spencer, who plays McCarthy\u2019s best friend since elementary school. They end up with super powers. In addition to McCarthy playing her usual bumbling loser, there\u2019s lots of potential for physical humor. Sadly, neither of these opportunities is especially realized.  There are some mildly amusing moments for McCarthy, but no situations or lines are especially funny. Spencer just plays the straight woman without any potential for comedy. The action revolves around encounters with villains, but it\u2019s mostly just bodies flying thru the air. McCarthy needs to break out of her husband\u2019s mediocre abilities if she ever wants her movies to get better.",

Yes, I watched Thunder Force starring Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer, which was released on NetflixOkay, Streamers, I accidentally watched another female-led superhero flick this weekend instead of that anticipated one from the MCU. Yes, I watched Thunder Force starring Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer, which was released on Netflix back in April. It's a nice, family-oriented action-comedy set in a world where supervillains called Miscreants run rampant. McCarthy and Spencer play estranged best friends, who reconnect in the midst of Spencer's character developing a treatment that provides superpowers to counter the evil Miscreants in order to avenger her parents' deaths.A new movie starring Melissa McCarthy and directed by Ben Falcone seems to come out every six months (Superintelligence was released on HBOMax in November 2020). She typically plays the main protagonist, who is an unhinged mess with a heart of gold. Usually, there is a more grounded foil to McCarthy's character, who puts up with her antics and builds a friendship despite all of the mess. Thunder Force follows that formula to the letter except there is the superhero twist this time. In that sense, there's really nothing to see here - the only additional development is that there are two middle aged women kicking butt, which is nice. They have some fun with that, but it's not something that's acknowledged much. Octavia Spencer does her best to keep up with McCarthy's high-wire comedy. Sandra Bullock was a better match to McCarthy in The Heat. I did like seeing Spencer in this mode even though it is not a natural fit - Ma was a better departure for her. I'll also mention that Jason Bateman has some very funny moments throughout.Meh.If you've seen one McCarthy/Falcone movie, you've seen them all and if you like them, then you may like this. Thunder Force is nice, inoffensive and has some funny moments, but there isn't anything special here. I'd say play it in the background if you are bored with just a handful of popcorn.",
