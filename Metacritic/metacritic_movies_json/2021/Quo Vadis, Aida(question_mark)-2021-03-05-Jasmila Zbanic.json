  "critic_reviews": [
    "Bosnian director Jasmila Žbanić succeeds where many filmmakers fail in conveying the dimensions of a mass atrocity in a film that matches clear-eyed personal experience to history in a lightly fictionalized story.",
    "Quo Vadis, Aida? has the narrative beats and the intensity of a classic thriller: a cornered protagonist, an implacable villain, a breathless pace, hair’s-breadth escapes.",
    "Superbly executed, Quo Vadis, Aida? is a masterful high wire act of tension and devastating humanism.",
    "The rigorous honesty of Quo Vadis, Aida? is harrowing, partly because it subverts many of the expectations that quietly attach themselves to movies about historical trauma. We often watch them not to be confronted with the cruelty of history, but to be comforted with redemptive tales of resistance, resilience and heroism.",
    "Quo Vadis, Aida? re-creates history in the present tense, with a gut-clutching immediacy that Žbanić makes bearable through sheer formal restraint.",
    "This is not historical revisionism, if anything, Quo Vadis, Aida? works to un-revise history, re-centering the victims’ plight as the eye of a storm of evils — not only the massacre itself, but the broader evils of institutional failure and international indifference.",
    "There’s a real tragic power in this almost unbearably brutal and shocking movie from writer-director Jasmila Žbanić.",
    "As a fictionalised account of what was once described as the worst European genocide in the post-war period, Quo Vadis, Aida? is wrenching and vital in its bitter grief. As a study of political and diplomatic inertia in the face of contemporary global human tragedies, it could not be more urgent.",
    "Zbanic expertly wades through the scenario so that we aren’t taken for granted. Rather than show us what we know is happening, she includes foreshadowing, rumors, and expressions to put a chill in our spine instead. What’s more is her ability to weave in the reality that this fight concerns divisions on the lines of religion and race rather than pure geography.",
    "In Quo Vaids, Aida?, Žbanic lays bare the deeply human toll of violence and war.",
    "The energy and passion of Zbanic’s fresh, new, direct gaze at the conflict comes through in every frame.",
    "The subject is horrifying but the screen is hard to look away from, as the situation becomes a powder keg of tension.",
    "It’s all too common for history to remember victims as numbers, but Quo Vadis, Aida? counters this, offering instead an eye-opening and deeply felt personal portrait of tragedy.",
    "Jasmila Zbanic’s Quo Vadis, Aida? is a razor-sharp incrimination of failed foreign policies from around the world embedded in a deeply humanist and moving character study of the kind of person that these policies leave behind.",
    "This study in chaos and calculation not only makes for harrowingly compelling viewing, but it also exposes the apathy of an international community that simply turned the other way.",
    "Like the unblinking closeup that concludes the deeply moving (and ultimately redemptive?) epilogue to Quo Vadis, Aida?, Žbanić’s powerful and personal film keeps its eyes wide open."

I lay there motionless witnessing the horrors of war. Why did the atrocity represented here happen? The film clearly points to the inefficiency of the UN; it's just frustrating seeing them as mere spectators of the whole crisis.Jasna Djuricic's role as Aida is so powerful, and it really deserved more recognition. The way she translates the concern of a mother in the most difficult of situations is very convincing. It took me a while to finally see this film, and I just have to thank Zbanic for exploring a very painful chapter of the history of her country and the whole world.",

The need for this movie is demonstrated by the 0 star reviews you see on this website. What do I mean by that? Well, the Srebrenica Genocide, which this movie is based upon, is denied by much of the Serb population despite the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the nearly 5,000 witnesses, over 2.5 million pages of transcripts, the DNA identification of the victims, and countless other pieces of evidence. The denialism and the failure to accept reality will continue (and take many different forms). One reason for that is that a large number of the perpetrators of this genocide, especially low-level ones, were never prosecuted and so they live and walk among the general population. Among these communities, convicted war criminals, like Ratko Mladic, are glorified and viewed as heroes. So when you see a 0 star review, what you are looking at is not a review of the movie on its merits and faults but the widespread--among nationalist Serbs--genocide denial.",

Ethnic strife between three different groups of Bosnia's population (Serbs, Croatians and Bosnian Muslims), whose animosity goes back for centuries. Were they good neighbors who got swept by the conflict, or eternal enemies, prevented by a strong state from belligerence is hard to say. What becomes obvious is how thin is the veneer of civilization and how easy is to become both a victim and a perpetrator. It all depends whether one is on a winning or a losing side.   Great directing and impressive acting.This is one of the best movies of this year. Must see.",

ToldThe Srebenica Massacre of 1995 was one of the most horrific incidents of the Bosnian War, and the chilling events that led up to it as it played out are presented in unsettling detail in this superb, if troubling, historical account. Told from the perspective of a UN interpreter who struggles to find safety for her family during the crisis, the film follows the ordeals of Muslim refugees fleeing the onslaught of merciless Serb militants and the United Nations' inability and ineptitude in providing the protection promised them. Director Jasmila Zbanic's latest puts viewers in the middle of the unfolding genocide, re-creating the horror and anguish experienced by those caught up in it without ever becoming graphic or gratuitous but nevertheless palpably unnerving. The excellent ensemble cast, led by the award-worthy performance of Jasna Djuricic as the desperate protagonist, sell this story so effectively that one can't help but feel what they and their peers are going through. \"Quo Vadis, Aida?\" will undoubtedly leave audiences uncomfortable and heartbroken, but it brings to light the unspeakable atrocities that occurred during this conflict in hopes that we never experience it again.",
