  "critic_reviews": [
    "It’s one of the director’s more mainstream efforts. What could easily devolve into a Crank-like exercise in hyperactivity is conducted with a steady hand and an appreciation for the details. Sono wants his audience to luxuriate in the brutal beauty of Boutella wielding a gatling gun.",
    "Sion Sono’s Prisoners of the Ghostland throws so much extreme weirdness and violence at us that we might overlook the fact that there’s method to its madness: Beneath the craziness and cacophony lies a tender, tragic tale of emotional paralysis and a civilization eating away at itself.",
    "I think that Prisoners of the Ghostland belongs in the category that was previously only really reserved for Jodorowsky’s El Topo, and that is the Acid Western. It embodies and revives that category of movie. If you like Westerns, martial arts, Japanese cinema, Nicolas Cage, or anything weird AF, then this is certainly for you.",
    "Ghostland is a movie and place borne from nuclear disaster, populated with the denizens of countless B-movies and the spectres of whiplash Hollywood careers.",
    "It’s not very good except sometimes when it’s fantastic.",
    "Prisoners of the Ghostland isn't going to be for everyone, but if you're on board with one of the craziest movies you'll see this year, then strap in and prepare for Nicolas Cage at his most unhinged.",
    "The film is held captive by its myriad influences, but Cage is so high-spirited that you won’t mind being its prisoner.",
    "You know exactly what brand of “weird” to expect from Nicolas Cage and Sion Sono, but what you might not expect is how much the film feels like a death dream about movies.",
    "Even when nothing else in the film makes sense, the unhinged ethos of its own creation leaves a clue behind with the clarity of a body-chalk outline.",
    "Prisoners of the Ghostland is equal parts visual delight and narrative head-scratcher. Most of all, it’s a hefty dose of Nicolas Cage set to full-tilt gonzo.",
    "Prisoners Of The Ghostland is by turns brilliant and rubbish. Cage is in his element, it has visual invention to spare, and the fight scenes are fun, but it’s a shame such imagination is tethered to equally all-over-the-place storytelling.",
    "The result is predictably excessive, noisy and more than a little exhausting. But mostly in a fun way, as long as you’re not bothered by gratuitous violence, incoherence and a deep streak of silly.",
    "Prisoners of the Ghostland is less a movie than an environment — not always hospitable but distinctly bizarre.",
    "Hate it or love it, Prisoners of the Ghostland is as unforgettable as it is expressive and provocative, and isn't that the fundamental purpose of art?",
    "Sono throws everything at the screen – samurai battles, shootouts, Cage shouting and threatening to karate chops the locals – but it rarely provides anything but the sense you’re watching bizarre performance art in place of a good film.",
    "As envisioned by Japanese director Sion Sono, the brains behind blood-drenched show Tokyo Vampire Hotel and flushed turtle-turned kaiju film Love & Peace, it’s a hoot. But Sono fans expecting the combo with Cage to go properly off may be somewhat surprised by a slightly sedate pace.",
    "Prisoners of the Ghostland exists entirely outside the norms and conventions of moviemaking. Really there’s only one word to describe it: nuts.",
    "It is an overstuffed, manic, exhausting piece of instant movie-meme catnip – likely impenetrable to all but the hardest of hardcore genre devotees.",
    "What keeps Ghostland from flatlining is Sono’s gift for delirious spectacle, along with the movie’s tacit acknowledgment that it’s utterly ridiculous.",
    "The question is whether its lol-random approach will appeal to you, or whether its giddy need to throw everything at the wall just flattens into an obnoxious desire to please. Prisoners of the Ghostland knows exactly what it is, but that may not necessarily be a good thing.",
    "The actual experience of watching this gonzo dystopian samurai western is far from the shock-a-minute journey that one would expect, but even in its more banal sequences, Sono’s imaginative eye peeks through.",
    "No movie with Nicolas Cage, directed by the wonderfully weird Japanese director Sion Sono, should be this taxing, drawn out, and plainly boring.",
    "Sono’s visuals, sizzlingly realized by the cinematographer Sohei Tanikawa, lack neither brio nor imagination. But the ludicrousness of the plot severs any emotional connection to a story whose apocalyptic stylings (the Ghostland of the title is a nuclear wasteland) gesture toward Japan and America’s painful history.",
    "And no, it doesn’t make much sense. Surely this is the strangest movie Cage has ever been in, and that’s saying something.  But arresting image follows arresting image in Sono’s fevered vision.",
    "An “Escape From New York”-meets-“Mad Max” ripoff that desperately wants to be a bonkers, midnight drive-in cult classic but doesn’t have the camp value or the memorably off-the-wall storyline to make the cut.",
    "A maniacal whirlwind of cinematic insanity, it feels equally likely that Prisoners of the Ghostland could become a cult classic or disappear into the fog. Whether its overall inscrutability is a bug or a feature remains to be seen.",
    "Somehow, it doesn’t actually seem surprising that Cage would partner with Sono. But the creative choices they make together, from an exploding gumball machine to endangered testicles — well, they must be seen to be believed.",
    "While the film far outshines most of Cage’s recent efforts (he was direct-to-VOD when direct-to-VOD wasn’t cool) in terms of art direction and fearlessly madcap storytelling, the results are nonetheless muddled and messy.",
    "It’s almost worth watching just for the way that Cage delivers the word “testicle”: it sounds as though all the syllables got caught in a combine harvester and then had to be reassembled, with the accents and emphases in the wrong places. It is, like much of the film, utterly barmy.",
    "Any film that hands Sofia Boutella a katana can’t be dismissed as an entirely fruitless exercise. It’s the Algerian actress and dancer, rather than Cage, who proves to be Ghostland’s greatest asset. And when your damsel is evidently capable of dealing with her own distress, thank you very much, the rescue mission can’t help but feel a touch redundant.",
    "Ultimately, Prisoners of the Ghostland is an OK film by a great filmmaker who has made truly great films, most memorable for its cast and the fact Sono finally made an English-language movie. Yet, when what's noteworthy about a film is just that it exists, it's more a vapor than an actual phantom.",
    "It alternates between too simplistic and incomprehensible, spending much of its time in between those poles in the \"I understand, but I don't care\" zone.",
    "The film is a profound disappointment in part because it feels so overdetermined to live up to Sion Sono and Nicholas Cage’s respective brands."

Playing out like a live-action oddball anime, this samurai western black comedy can certainly be delightfully strange at times. Yet, what keeps it from reaching the same heights as other of the Matchstick Men star's wackier outings like, say, Willy's Wonderland is that its peculiarity is really all it has to offer.Sion Sono was intent on packing every scene with as many eccentric sights as possible, so there's always something interestingly bizarre to look at and I was left consistently impressed by his ability to direct such elaborate clutters of madness. The vast majority of it though occurs without meaning. An enticingly goofy opening gives way to a lengthy middle portion where the plotting hits a brick wall and only a few noteworthy moments can be found (all of which involve the lead's ballsack), before eventually picking up again in the action-packed finale. This causes the curious flourishes and outlandish visuals to often feel like filler content designed to pad out the length rather than anything of actual significance. Particularly inspired filler, but filler nonetheless.If you're like me and check out Cage's work just to see whatever kind of ridiculous crap he's getting up to next, you'll get a sense of satisfaction out of knowing you watched what may very well be the weirdest release of his career thus far. It's weirdness without substance however so its staying power compared to his modern successes such as Color Out of Space is limited. Perhaps even being one of the more forgettable entries in his catalog overall, outside of the one or two instances where it delivers some of the most memorable Cage-isms to date.6.6/10",

This was one of the most laborious things I’ve ever watched. I don’t mind the setting, visuals, the FX or the acting, but it needed to be filmed significantly better, and have a less “video” aesthetic, for it to earn how pompous it was coming off. It’s not horrible and at many times it was entertaining and different. However, it was trying way too hard to be different for the sake of being different. It has a story, but it’s more stream of consciousness how it gets from place to place as the plot moves forward. There might be higher meaning in a lot of the dialogue that is spoken, but it’s lost in the silly chanting and antics that are happening in every other scene. I swear it was like a cast of people try to out “Nicolas Cage” the actual Nicolas Cage.",

It relishes in the weird and the movie is that much better for it. Easily the weirdest movie of 2021. Cage delivers another delirious performance.",
