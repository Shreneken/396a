It’s Tunes versus Goons in the highest-stakes challenge of his life, that will redefine LeBron’s bond with his son and shine a light on the power of being yourself. The ready-for-action Tunes destroy convention, supercharge their unique talents and surprise even “King” James by playing the game their own way.… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "This newest “Space Jam” installment is a good time and boasts real heart. LeBron’s steady work as the lead and a narrative undercurrent built on a believable father-son relationship makes for a breezy 115 minutes and improves on the harmless, yet admittedly stiff original. And while LeBron might not be in the Finals right now, he has definitely scored a win here.",
    "There may be a big, corporate, algorithm-like formula deciding that a quarter-century later it's time for another Space Jam, but it's good to see that the insouciant anarchy of Termite Terrace is still pure, unrepentant id.",
    "Space Jam: A New Legacy enters the 21st century with LeBron James, impressive visuals, more personal stakes, and a fantastic villain in Don Cheadle. Unfortunately, the movie is too concerned with showcasing Warner Bros.’ biggest franchises that Bugs Bunny and Friends get sidelined in their own movie.",
    "The fast pace is attention-span theatre for the young’uns, and the adult-aimed quips are entertaining for a while.",
    "Space Jam: A New Legacy is a fun family movie bolstered by a good heart and strong visuals that make up for a lack in originality.",
    "LeBron has charm to burn, even if his performance is unlikely to keep Denzel awake at night. It’s a shame this messy film can’t keep pace with his likability or mad skills.",
    "Space Jam: A New Legacy is chaotic, rainbow sprinkle-colored nonsense that, unlike the original, manages to hold together as a movie.",
    "Though Space Jam: A New Legacy fails, woefully, as an aesthetic object and as a viewing experience, it somehow nonetheless succeeds as a conceptual representation of a Hollywood studio’s terror in the face of streaming domination, of the movie industry at large that, like Warner Bros., is in the process of being swallowed up in one Serververse or another.",
    "A New Legacy is much slicker and more appealing than the original Space Jam, in no small part because James is approximately 50 times the actor Jordan is. But it’s also because corporations handing a bag of unrelated IP and ordering screenwriters to come up with a story around them is the template for most studio filmmaking now, if not all of contemporary existence.",
    "An exercise anchored to a likable LeBron charmfest, melding multiple forms of animation, recycled cartoon jokes, and the basic plot of the original Space Jam, but with a twist that updates the original for our new, streaming content century.",
    "Although A New Legacy runs at least a half hour too long and generates zero tension with the central “basketball” game, it’s not without its share of small pleasures.",
    "If this is corporate synergy fired up to a terrifying new level, there’s still enough heart at the movie’s center to keep it from becoming all business.",
    "The original Space Jam was an out-of-nowhere delight, and Jordan gave space to his fellow live action co-stars, such as Bill Murray, Larry Bird and Wayne Knight. It was also in and out in 87 minutes; Space Jam: A New Legacy, directed by a good filmmaker, Malcolm D. Lee (Girls Trip, The Best Man), is a bloated 115 minutes, its mayhem and madness wearing pretty thin as it goes along.",
    "A New Legacy fails to deliver on Who Framed Roger Rabbit-type spectacle, despite its exciting formal conceit of being able to weave between live-action and flat or CG animation. What felt like the twentieth sighting of Pennywise and the Penguin as extras cheering court-side during the climactic game exemplifies this film’s lack of imagination in visualizing basketball, or rather its digital universe.",
    "The new edition is comparatively an air ball: It’s less a family-friendly film with a hoops legend and more a crassly referential love letter to all things Warner Bros.",
    "Aside from cast changes and some plot tweaks, there’s not much new to see here. James is an engaging presence, but as this season with the Lakers proved, he alone just isn’t enough.",
    "On the whole, I’d go with the 2018 basketball comedy “Uncle Drew” over either “Jams.” One-joke movies, all three. But it helps when the gags don’t stop at the reference point and dribble in place while the clock runs out.",
    "Director Malcolm D. Lee (“Girls Trip,” “The Best Man”) and the credited screenwriters try to wring a little fun out of all this, and miss as often as they hit. But younger kids will eat up the eye candy and get a tiny taste of what The Looney Tunes were all about, even if this big budget monstrosity never comes close to the anarchy created by Chuck Jones, Tex Avery and the team at Warner Brothers’ “Termite Terrace.”",
    "The corporate-synergy-ness of it all is both deeply distressing and unintentionally fascinating.",
    "Maybe the rabbit and his studio both took a wrong turn at Albuquerque. Space Jam: A New Legacy takes almost nothing but wrong turns, all leading to a glittering CGI trash heap of cameos, pat life lessons, and stale internet catchphrases. Its first misstep: keeping Bugs, Daffy, and the rest of the gang on the bench for about as long as it would take the audience to watch three and a half Merrie Melodies.",
    "The concept is ripe for biting satire at how super-serving content can often by detrimental to art and creativity, but instead Space Jam: A New Legacy is a briefly and all-too-infrequently enjoyable hybrid of sports comedy and family drama that doubles as egregious product placement on the largest possible scale.",
    "James’s natural charisma should allow the film to soar but he’s bogged down by an avalanche of distracting cameos, from Gremlins to Game of Thrones.",
    "Critics will pick on this overstuffed sequel to the 1996 animated-live-action hoops hit. It’s what we do when an alleged creative enterprise turns into a corporate ad campaign.  Expect no grumbles from the under-13 crowd eager to eyeball  LeBron James jamming in cyberspace with cartoon royalty.",
    "Like most corporate cinematic endeavors, Space Jam: A New Legacy tries to have it both ways, proclaiming to be on the side of the angels while doing the work of the Devil. It criticizes shameless, money-grubbing attempts to synergize and update beloved classics (as LeBron himself puts it, “This idea is just straight-up bad”) … all the while shamelessly synergizing and updating beloved classics.",
    "Despite some dazzling animation, this is a mess of celebrity and corporate cameos that fails to capture the weird spirit of the ’90s original, or the ’40s heyday — more ‘suffering’ than ‘succotash’.",
    "It’s no slam dunk for King James in a reprise that shows you can only spread Space Jam so far.",
    "There’s a nearly astute satire of the app-driven life bubbling under the meta high jinks. And the movie throws so many gags at the screen that several jokes actually stick. But the purposeful sensory overload mostly yields head-spinning stupefaction, leaving a viewer feeling like Wile E. Coyote after hitting a mesa wall.",
    "Space Jam 2's desire to tap into the nostalgia associated with its predecessor leaves the sequel feeling unoriginal and predictable.",
    "It wants to comment on the algorithms that rule our lives, spewing constantly recycled content at us seemingly at random, but it is exactly the thing that it points to: an upcycled Frankenstein’s monster of intellectual property spraying a stew of Easter eggs and Halloween costumes at the viewer, praying that something sticks.",
    "Throughout the game, during the action sequences and especially during the timeouts and strategy sessions, the “celebrity” fans are a huge distraction — and making things even more bizarre, their numbers include Pennywise the Clown from “It” and the murderous, rapist gang known as the Droogs from “A Clockwork Orange.” Who in the name of Bugs Bunny thought this was a good idea?",
    "Debates over LeBron James' greatness compared to Michael Jordan on a basketball court will continue in perpetuity, but \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\" won't fuel much chatter about who's the better actor. Putting James in Jordan's shoes, as it were, isn't a bad idea in theory, but despite the odd moment of inspired Looney Tune-acy, this reboot shoots a very loud and thudding airball.",
    "Algorithmically speaking, it's no slam dunk.",
    "Space Jam: A New Legacy is as relentlessly odd as its predecessor, but its even giddier interest in corporate synergy turns it into a far more cynical outing. It will sell so many plush toys.",
    "A few laughs accrued from Bugs Bunny, but mostly a depressing slog",
    "To be fair, it’s not all unpleasant. The joyride through the Warner Bros. IP universe is not quite as soul-busting as the trailer led me to believe it would be, though I suspect it benefited only in comparison to my expectations.",
    "Space Jam: A New Legacy is so overwhelmingly suffused with corporate propaganda that it seems like the filmmakers are seeking exactly that sort of praise: not satisfying cinema, not a worthwhile story, not a fun time at the movies, but “a great product.”",
    "The animation, consisting of both traditional 2D and CGI, is impressive, and there’s certainly a lot of it. But it never feels as joyful as you’d hope, too often coming across like corporate machination than inspired imagination.",
    "So what if this movie essentially forgets to have a coherent plot or any real stakes; look at all of the exciting crossovers!",
    "The story isn’t necessarily awful, but it’s mostly boring, stretching itself out to an unwieldy 115 minutes.",
    "Over its interminable, nearly two-hour runtime, the film repeatedly mocks its very existence.",
    "Viewers who, for whatever reason, love the first “Space Jam” may well find themselves delighted all over again, but as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to plunge a beloved sports figure into a century’s worth of pop culture iconography, “A New Legacy” is a big fat airball.",
    "As soon as LeBron and Dom are sucked into computer space, A New Legacy largely abandons its underlying criticism of soulless corporate regurgitation of art-as-product and instead becomes an exhausting tour through the Warner Bros. catalog.",
    "By halftime of this two hour piece of dreck, you’ll wonder why you weren’t more appreciative that the first one only wasted 80 minutes of your life.",
    "Space Jam: A New Legacy, both in its cravenly cynical development and release, is not a surprising film. The marketing didn’t lie. This movie is exactly what it looks like. And it’s a grim glimpse at a potential future of mainstream filmmaking. No thanks",
    "The movie is just a big, empty declaration of corporate dominance, a whirling CGI tornado that — like a much stupider Tasmanian Devil — ingests, barely processes and then promptly regurgitates everything in its path. It’s Upchuck Jones.",
    "The core issues of the film – its numbing swirls of rainbow light popping out every which way, the excruciating pop-culture catchphrases passed off as humor, LeBron’s stilted, if game, acting, the half-assedness with which it delivers the dusty moral to be yourself, the fact that it is unaccountably one half-hour longer than its predecessor – all seem minor in comparison with the insidious ulterior intentions that power this fandom dynamo."

That many different voices can’t be a good sign of a unified creative approach. Sadly, this lives down to those expectations. LeBron James is as stiff as his predecessor Michael Jordan in this reboot of the 1996 film. He and his young son (played by an actor) get trapped in a digital world where they’re pitted against each other by AI (Don Cheadle, desperately trying to bring the funny). James enlists the classic Looney Tunes characters for his team, which should be where the comedy comes, but alas, their wisecracks never land…they just play to their physical gag stereotypes. Not only is the movie never funny, but in an attempt to add a family friendly heart, there’s too much time wasted on the father/son relationship. Young’uns will be able to enjoy the animated whimsy, but anyone with any standards will just yawn or stop playback early.",

Taking out a character because weak reason that even a child can destroy, changing the already corny plot, making this movie more diverse ( by that they meant putting a ton of black actors and barely anything else that's diversity right?) And finally putting Le James and knowing people don't like the guy was the biggest blow they could've done. Hire anyone besides a person who isn't a actor it's like hiring a lawyer who isn't a lawyer or a plumber who isn't a plumber because it'll go well right? What people forget is the damage they do to the characters and everyone involved.They lost money no way are they using the loony toons again in something. James will get dunked on by everyone for failing to act and making a decent movie. Black actors will look bad and say \"it's because something something racism\" No that doesn't work that way. Just because you bombed doesn't mean it's a race problem just make a freaking good movie. The real problem with this movie is how it does everything wrong and doesn't get a cancel mob on it. Media in general is killing off every single thing that was good and now we get this \"diversity\" woke trash (again hiring 80% or more black cast isn't diversity its the same problem but the other way around) hope you like Anime andKorean webtoons because thank God they know what sells!",

A current world where sexualization is exposed everywhere: fluid gender, non-binary, homosexuality, women showing off on the internet naked, girls cosplaying in tiny clothes to gain a following on social media, women showing off intimate parts on Tik Tok to earn likes and money... But the look of a 1996 cartoon is not good. 1996 was better than 2021. Do you know why? The minority had access to the internet. Today, with globalization, everyone can communicate: those who think and those who have the brains to decorate.They sealed Pepe le Pew accusing it of being a harassment cartoon, instead of the fabulous geniuses of the WB board putting Pepe le Pew just romantic but without grabbing Penelope.They almost sealed the Ligeirinho, accused of racism and prejudice against the Mexicans. But building a wall to separate the United States from Mexico and killing anyone trying to cross the border is very ethical.Society is preventing society itself from living. It will get to the point where everyone is lying vegetating on top of a bed. If you try to walk, you're going to be bothering someone.",

Not only that with all that’s going on I wanted to be right there to make sure they weren’t trying to push some ideas onto my kids. With that being said this movie was terrible. I gave it a chance I really did. Don Cheadle carried the movie which says a lot since Lebron was the main character. I cringed the whole time they referred to him as a king. My kids actually thought he was a king and I of course had to explain to them that he in fact wasn’t. The voices of the Looney Tunes sounded like cheap knock offs. Zendaya being “a great actress” couldn’t even pull off a cartoon voice as always because she can’t act. The only funny parts about the movie was when they referenced GOT “Winter is coming” and when Daffy thought Michael B. Jordan was Michael Jordan. Other than that my kids got bored and we put on the Space Jam with Michael Jordan. They ended up having more laughs with that one. They’ve been watching that one on repeat ever since.

The original is simple. This one just throws constant references at you at every angle at all times and its distracting. Also Lebron hyping his team up after they're down? Thats out of character for him. He loves to quit on teams midgame and leave them. If this movie were any accurate, he would have joined the Goon Squad at halftime. I'm not blinded by nostalgia.

The story, the acting, the CGI, the references, the script. All of it feels terrible compared to the first film. The first film isn’t that great either but at least it was self aware. This isn’t. The film doesn’t understand when it is making fun of itself and it shows. I enjoyed the references in the first film as they felt natural but this was Ready Player One on steroids and if you don’t like Ready Player One like me, then this will be a nightmare. Sometimes there are cool Easter eggs in the background but some of it feels weird. I love A Clockwork Orange but it still feels weird to see a bunch of characters from that movie watching a Basketball Game. The humor is unintentionally funny. I never laughed at a joke they were trying to make but I laughed at almost everything else because it was so bad that it’s funny. I enjoyed watching this movie but that was probably because I was with friends. I feel like watching this on your own is a painful experience. I did find myself being painfully bored during points but the jokes my friends were making and their reactions helped keep my interest. All of the performances are AWFUL. Lebron James did an awful job. Michael Jordan wasn’t great in the first film either but his performance felt intentionally funny but this was just painful to watch. Don Cheadle was really weird as well. The only reason I kind of enjoyed his performance was because I was joking about him the whole time. The script is the most predictable boring story ever. The first film’s script was predictable as well but the journey to get there was fun and this wasn’t fun. The visual effects look kind of decent at times except Live Action Lola Bunny. Her eyes look really really weird for some reason. I would really only recommend this if you watch it with friends. It’s a lot funnier to watch this with other people than on your own.",

The villain is generic as hell and has a pretty stupid motivation. The soundtrack is a bunch of random songs that should serve as a reference to other movies/shows, but it ends up terrible and annoying, very, very bad. Characters are stupid and forgettable.
