  "critic_reviews": [
    "Beyond the strength of the visuals, there’s promise in the young cast that you see glimpses of here. ... However, it’s never enough to make “Gully” worth watching. Its raw, gritty approach feels like an effort from the filmmakers, but it’s mostly work for the audience to endure.",
    "It’s a film filled with half-hearted ideas and thin characters, all in the service of a story that wallows in its trauma in a manner that gives it little purpose."

I feel that the direction of the movie was poor, withouth spoiler i have to say that the overall pace of the movie was its biggest defect. It is very sad to see this kind of product when the cinemas are struggling to secure its deserved place in the entertainment culture.
