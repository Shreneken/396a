  "summary": "For the first time in the cinematic history of Spider-Man, our friendly neighborhood hero is unmasked and no longer able to separate his normal life from the high-stakes of being a Super Hero. When he asks for help from Doctor Strange the stakes become even more dangerous, forcing him to discover what it truly means to be Spider-Man.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The film's real superpowers are its endearing performances, and a screenplay by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers that interweaves teen-angst soap opera and cosmic calamity with all the goofy logic and tonal nimbleness that make the best superhero comics so appealing.",
    "This is how superhero movies are supposed to be: thrilling and funny and moving and full of popcorn-fueled joy.",
    "A monumentally successful Spider-instalment which pulls off a tricky and ambitious narrative trick with all the grace of a balcony-top backflip. At the risk of getting cheesy, it won't just make you cheer, it'll make you want to hug your friends, too.",
    "So often in these big multi-villain events, the hero gets swallowed up, but here he defines the film. If this really is Holland’s last outing, then he leaves having kept true to the spirit of his Spidey.",
    "For more casual consumers of the costumed comic-book superhero’s exploits, mileage may vary. But there’s a whole lot to like here.",
    "It’s the gargantuan and deeply satisfying Spider-Man: No Way Home in which the former Billy Elliot proves he’s more than a teen idol with a perfect American accent. This time, his Peter’s got gravitas, emotional oomph, brutality, believable love, an anguished scene in the rain! The movie is the actor’s best performance yet, in anything, Spandex or no.",
    "Director Jon Watts’ third Spidey film is a rousing entry that doubles as a love letter to the comic-book character, a film very much about second chances and a cleverly crafted reminder of that famous adage: “With great power comes great responsibility.”",
    "The way that the movie eventually manages to bridge all those multiplicities and pull them into focus feels both obvious and ingenious.",
    "What I can say, without angering (almost) anyone, is that Spider-Man: No Way Home is both a gigantic act of franchise-mad hubris, and a ridiculous amount of fun.",
    "Separated from the most exciting/controversial/unexpected moments in play, and without the element of surprise, does No Way Home hold up as a good story well told? The answer is yes to a degree…but it could have gone further.",
    "It’s all very meta and self-referential; screenwriters Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers hoover up memorable lines from past movies and serve them with a flourish and an exaggerated wink to the audience. It’s also a good deal of fun.",
    "No Way Home feels like a full and complete film in a way that earlier MCU entries failed to. No Way Home takes a cynical corporate elevator pitch and uses it to examine what it means to be Spider-Man in a world where Holland’s Peter isn’t the only hero.",
    "Spider-Man: No Way Home occasionally creaks under the weight of its own ambition, but it's a monumentally entertaining installment of MCU multiversal madness that fans are going to adore.",
    "Peter Parker’s second Spider-verse adventure suggests that the concept just works – brilliantly.",
    "What makes the thing really fly – and it does still fly – is the witty energy of Jon Watts’s direction and the fizzy chemistry between the core actors.",
    "And if you're not intimately acquainted with two decades of previous Spider-Man films? If you're here for simply a well-oiled and entertaining Marvel (and Sony) flick, you won't be disappointed.",
    "Returning director Jon Watts — whose bright, slightly dorky touch lends a kind of continuity to this latest trilogy — wrangles this unwieldy premise into a consistently entertaining superhero entry, tying up two decades’ of loose ends in the process.",
    "Once No Way Home finds its rhythm, the picture builds to a thoughtful, touching final act that does justice to the heroism and self-sacrifice that has always been central to Spider-Man’s appeal.",
    "Briskly balancing a dizzying assortment of parts, Marvel's latest (by way of Sony) looks destined to do what only a spider can -- namely, lure vast numbers of fans into its web.",
    "Spider-Man: No Way Home bounces from hilarious to hurt with ease as both the darkest and funniest MCU Spider-Man entry to date.",
    "The pace is always zippy but rarely hyper, and there is just enough space for the film’s many emotional beats to resonate.",
    "It’s nowhere near the intimacy of Homecoming and Far from Home. Still, considering the heavy lifting it’s required to perform, it makes for a fitting grand finale for one of Marvel’s (and Sony’s) most enduring heroes.",
    "Tom Holland is better than ever in his surprise-packed, third solo outing as a teen hero in a onesie who’s out to save the world and a faltering pandemic box office. But this time the generic thrills are tempered with genuine emotion. Good one, Spidey.",
    "The supercharged CGI effects are fine and the battles are eye-popping, but the character interactions make No Way Home work.",
    "Holland provides the glue and the webbing for the latest Spidey outing Spider-Man: No Way Home. He’s physically nimble — he’s soon to play Fred Astaire in a biopic — quick-witted with his darting comic timing and an all-around easygoing presence. When the movie treats the mayhem and brutality for real, he’s there with the right degree of anguish.",
    "The filmmakers put their faith in a character, not fireworks, and the result is big blockbuster that feels more like a sweet little movie.",
    "Spider-Man: No Way Home is a comfort-food present to long-time fans, like a cross-over episode of one or more beloved TV series, with winks, call-backs, trivia, cameos, super-villains and copious destruction.",
    "No Way Home is overlong and its various temporal loop-the-loops start to wear out their welcome...All that said, there’s an imaginativeness to No Way Home, along with a ton of energy, that makes the viewer cut it a lot of slack.",
    "Yes, of course, “No Way Home” is incredibly calculated, a way to make more headlines after killing off so many of its event characters in Phase 3, but it’s also a film that’s often bursting with creative joy.",
    "Suffice to say, No Way Home hits its hoot-and-holler beats about as skillfully as Endgame did. There are moments here that will probably inspire comparable choruses of applause; by opening a wormhole into the multiverse of past Spider-Man movies, Marvel and Sony have made something like an all-purpose Spider-Man sequel, shrewdly designed to hit a whole range of nostalgia centers.",
    "It’s the giving season, so, sure, give us some fan service. But the story is still there (though the second act does start to feel a bit long) and I felt some actual emotion, even with all this chaos swirling around. And in the end Spider-Man: No Way Home somehow finds a way to keep it all together.",
    "There’s nothing new or particularly memorable about the serviceable CGI and practical effects, but we remain invested in the outcome in large part because Holland remains the best of the cinematic Spider-Men, while Zendaya lends heart and smarts and warmth to every moment she’s onscreen.",
    "The movie’s best surprise in the end isn’t so much that lifelong fans got the chance to see such an unprecedented crossover take place: It’s that it managed to give not just a character, but an actor another chance to make a great mark on one of the best roles in superhero stories.",
    "Mr. Holland carries the day with unaffected charm, the good stuff is really good and improbably joyous, and the writers have found a plausible way of pushing the reset button for a new round of high-flying web-slinging. The possibilities are nothing less than multifarious.",
    "Her casting as MJ and her expanded role in the series continue to pay off, and Zendaya’s charisma and gift for selling emotions (and silly dialogue) helps give the new movie a soft, steady glow that centers it like a heartbeat as the story takes off in different directions.",
    "The film is 148 minutes long. Many of those minutes are good, some not so good. \r\nBut one of them is great. Unreservedly so. Redemption and catharsis arrive in a single fleeting moment that wonderfully and succinctly ties up everything Watts is attempting. Truly one of my favorite scenes in a movie this year.",
    "Spider-Man: No Way Home brings Peter to his biggest screw-up yet, making for a fascinatingly messy film that tries to juggle fan service with a finale for Peter’s high school years.",
    "For all “No Way Home’s” vertiginous heights and precipitous drops, few things here shake you more fully than the anguished closeups of Holland, in which Peter’s genetically modified strength — and his all-too-human vulnerability — are on tear-soaked, grime-smudged display.",
    "If you poke too many holes in the narrative, Spider-Man: No Way Home starts to become undone. But if you take it at face value, it's a sweet, moving swing of a \"Spider-Man\" film that (mostly) manages to land.",
    "No Way Home is a perfectly fine superhero movie.",
    "This is the least fun of the Watts/Holland pictures by a wide margin (intentionally so, to some extent), but it’s a hell of a lot better than the last Spidey threequel, Sam Raimi’s overstuffed and ill-conceived Spider-Man 3.",
    "But that’s Spider-Man in a nutshell. He’s the guy who perpetually breaks stuff, then has to patch it all back together. (Good thing he’s got those webs.) No Way Home, with its use of the old characters from previous Spider-Man movies, really gets that idea. Power and responsibility are important. Seeing something through after you mess it up? That’s the mark of a genuine hero.",
    "The most superheroic feat on display might be the film’s ability to keep human-sized emotions and relationships front and center even as the very fabric of time and space twists itself into knots.",
    "No Way Home is Spider-Man’s most intriguing & fun story yet. Though the multiverse looms large, the film's thoughtful in its focus on Peter's journey.",
    "After so long playing with the legacy and impact of Spider-Man, No Way Home finds its way back.",
    "This is a movie engineered to resemble a thrill ride, a greatest-hits carousel powered by fan service and corporate recycling. It practically embraces Marty’s designation—and that’s OK. Despite their noted limitations, theme parks like this still offer plenty of fun.",
    "Spider-Man: No Way Home is maximalist, chock full of familiar characters and callbacks, and sometimes all that greatest-hits reminiscing is diverting and and entertaining. But it’s also not very necessary, making for a very regressive, fan-service-y ‘Spider-Man’ legacy-sequel that’s overly nostalgic for its heydays.",
    "The road to the closing moments of “No Way Home” — both warm-hearted and heartbreaking — might have hit a few bumps, but the darkness is worth it. After all, when was the last time the third film in a franchise got audiences truly thrilled for what comes next?",
    "The effects are off-the-chart dazzling, and if nothing else, the picture jumps out of the gate and sprints until one and all get good and winded entirely too quickly.",
    "If Spider-verse was about how anyone can be Spider-Man, No Way Home is a more authorized Spider-Man compendium; its tone leans more operatic than antic. Still, Watts has a human touch that can be lacking in superhero films, and nearly all of the actors who appear in No Way Home come across as individuals despite the high-concept narrative.",
    "Most of the callbacks are played for light humour, not self-importance. Yes, it’s easy to tell you’re being manipulated. But it’s just as easy to respond with: so what?",
    "It is what these films always are – source material for its own advertising campaign – but in this instance, it’s little more, which might have been a problem if said campaign hadn’t already proven such a roaring success.",
    "Though delightful in places, the third entry in Sony’s third Spider-Man cycle feels both overstocked and underwhelming.",
    "What I will say is that director Jon Watts handles this grand convergence of properties old and current with enough verve to almost sustain the long run of the film. But there’s so much brand Frankensteining to be done that there’s really no time for quirk and texture; much of the bounce and sparkle of the past two Holland films is lost.",
    "It’s flawed for sure but still moves with more deftness than most (arriving after Eternals is a blessing for any Marvel film) and there’s an ending that suggests an awareness of its roots (post-credits scene aside), hinting at a promising way forward rather than back. Consider the curse of sorts sort of broken.",
    "Spider-Man: No Way Home unfolds as though it were written by a room full of children who had just eaten a whole bag of sugar; it’s a hectic series of plot twists and deus ex machinas that overturns an entire bucket of action figures and smashes them all together with delight. The film might be a new nadir of cinema—but it’s also an undeniably watchable good time.",
    "The result is a laboriously convoluted narrative (Benedict Cumberbatch’s Doctor Strange plays a significant role) that only grows exponentially as the story unfolds, to diminishing returns.",
    "No Way Home feels like a greatest hits package specifically designed to hit every fan service button. It doesn’t give us any indication of where this story is going, or why we should care.",
    "There’s no attempt to hide that the film is pure fan service, a greatest-hits mashup of Spider-Man’s cinematic legacy.",
    "It’s not just the action and the magic that flop. Even the film’s more intimate moments fall flat."

      "content": "I made a decision not to see any more Spider-Man movies after Spider-Man: Homecoming. The adaptations were clearly not aimed at me, they felt very kiddy and I was done. Well I think we all know why I’m back now to see this particularI made a decision not to see any more Spider-Man movies after Spider-Man: Homecoming. The adaptations were clearly not aimed at me, they felt very kiddy and I was done. Well I think we all know why I’m back now to see this particular adaptation, I finally caved and went to see the new Spider-Man. No spoilers but if you’ve made it this far without knowing any major plot points then you must be living off the grid because by now the spoilers are everywhere you look.Picking up immediately after Spider-Man: Far From Home with Spider-Man’s identity now revealed to the entire world, Peter (Tom Holland) looks to Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help undoing this situation. Well the spell doesn’t exactly go according to plan and soon dangerous enemies from other worlds start showing up and causing havoc. Peter must then embark upon a journey to discover what it really means to be Spider-Man, “with great power comes great responsibility” and all that. It’s not a Spider-Man movie if you don’t have the responsibility quote.Look my main issue with the Holland Spider-Man movies was that they never actually felt like Spider-Man movies but more like an Iron Man movie featuring Spider-Man or in this case a Doctor Strange movie featuring Spider-Man. At this rate Spider-Man is getting overshadowed in his own movies. I missed the more focused Spider-Man films in the Tobey Maguire era (not you Spider-Man 3). I liked the simple costume, one main villain and enough room to develop the characters. With each new adaptation of Spider-Man they became more overblown with mediocre villains. Well there’s plenty of villains to go around this time with one in particular stealing the show. Also it’s worth mentioning that J.K. Simmons played a character so well in the Sam Raimi movies that not only did they not even try to recast him for The Amazing Spider-Man movies but for No Way Home they just got him back as the iconic J. Jonah Jameson. He is one of the few on-screen characters that looks like he was 100% lifted straight from the comic book pages and onto the big screen.It’s very cheesy and it had some great moments that I thoroughly enjoyed but let’s not pretend that Spider-Man: No Way Home didn’t just look at the success of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and copy that format. One scene set in the woods particularly stands out and almost looks like a complete remake. There is a strong sense of paying fan service here and attempting to keep everyone happy. But as we all know, you can’t keep every group of fans happy but No Way Home was probably the best attempt so far. As I’ve said before, nostalgia sells and the opportunity here to get every single Spider-Man fan into the cinema to see No Way Home was too great to miss. At least it tried to fix some of the issues that the other films messed up on, I enjoyed it but nothing will ever come close to the first two Sam Raimi Spider-Man films.

In this one, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) finds his life spiraling out of control after his identity as Spider-Man is revealed to the world following the events of 'Far From Home, and he soon seeks out Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help in order to try and undo the events from occurring, which inadvertently opens up the multiverse and unleashes several familiar villains, including the likes of Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina), The Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), Electro (Jamie Foxx), and many more. Now I know what some of you may be here for, and some of you (or at least those of you who don't mind spoilers) more than likely want me to tell you whether past Spidermen Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield are in fact in the film, which of course has been the biggest rumor swirling around this film. And to that I say to simply just do what I did prior to walking into this film, and just go in expecting this to be a great film regardless of what that outcome may or may not be, because this film delivered in so many other fantastic ways! The action is incredible, the emotions run surprisingly high, and there's plenty of winks and nods and Easter eggs galore that call back to several past 'Spider-Man' films. For those of you worried about excessive fan service, you needn't worry, as it's only ever used to serve and progress the story further without being too overbearing. As for the performances, while you usually wouldn't expect much from a superhero film, Tom Holland delivers what I'd easily call his best performance to date. Furthermore, his  chemistry with Zendaya remains one of the most charming and endearing aspects of these films. Another one of my favorite things were the villains and seeing all their familiar faces, cause trust me when I say that the nostalgia factor here is going to run VERY high with almost any audience member who grew up watching both the Sam Raimi trilogy and the two 'Amazing Spider-Man' films, and the villains all undoubtedly play a great and huge part in that. Really if there's any issue I have at all with this film, it's that it maybe even gets a little too overly sentimental a time or two, but most people probably won't even mind that, and this film is already near perfect as is! So overall, I'd say that this is EASILY the best Spider-Man film to date, and even one of the best superhero films of recent memory! Quite simply put, it's the ultimate love letter to Spider-Man, and I really don't think anybody's gonna to be disappointed with this one, trust me on that!",

In addition to being a snooze festival, it was so cornyBefore all the hype, I wanted to see Spider-Man in the movies, and the hype only made me want to see more. I didn't know what to expect, but I certainly expected better than what I saw. In addition to being a snooze festival, it was so corny and saccharine that I made an appointment to visit the dentist during the film.The film began to deteriorate the moment Peter Parker (Tom Holland) went to Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for a spell to make everyone forget about him. It wasn't a bad idea for Peter to go to Doctor Strange to fix his little revealed identity problem, it was just weirdly dumb of Doctor Strange to actually accommodate Peter. Dr. Strange really tried to make everyone in the world forget who Peter Parker was. It was a massive spell that felt too excessive just to fix a man's problems. The movie went into silly mode as Parker kept interrupting Doctor Strange as he did the spell. The result was a multitude of old enemies from different universes converging on this universe to find Parker. If it was explained, it was poorly explained.At this point, the film was on shaky ground, but it didn't budge. \"No Way Home\" would suffer another setback when Parker fought Strange to stop him from sending all these villains back to their respective universes. See, if they came back, they would meet death at the hands of, or because of, this universe's Spider-Man, and this universe's Spider-Man was too moralistic to allow that to happen. No, Parker would fix this so everyone could go home and live happily ever after.Everything after that part of the movie was immaterial to me in the grand scheme. To me, when a plot is based on a flawed or just plain bad premise, everything that follows is equally wrong and pointless. Not that the things that follow can't be aesthetically cool; they are just empty.Parker was acting on the fair advice of his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei). By his wisdom, Parker had an obligation to help these poor misguided men, no matter what the exponentially more experienced Doctor Strange said. Doctor Strange wanted to do the most logical thing which was to send each villain back to their own universe and let fate take over from there. Parker, with his oversized heart and undersized common sense, wanted to keep them in his own universe as pet projects until he could fix them and then send them back. Forget that he would actively tamper with the course of events from another universe, massively altering their timelines with incalculable consequences, he simply wasn't old enough, wisdom, or experience enough to know what the best thing to do was. Also, it was a slap in the face to the other Spider-Men. As if to say, \"You guys are screwed, I'm going to find a better, healthier solution because I'm a better Spider-Man.\"I was so disturbed by this new Spider-Man mission to save these villains that everything after that started to bother me. The attempts at comedy were awkward and grossly bland. The emotional moments were very frequent and long. The last nail in the coffin of this was execution time. Man, they dragged this. I could tolerate a didactic and flawed plot if you explained it to us in a quick and exciting way, but in their attempts to send this great spider-man, we had to suffer through an ocean of tears, an abyss of emotions and an abundance of silence with slow music. Everything was set up for them to restart Spider-Man if necessary, but at this point I could use a break and no more Spider-Men about \"home\".",

This movie had no business being this good. All it needed to be was a quirky introduction to the multiverse slathered with fan-service. Tom Holland could have just joked around with his buds and the movie would have made billions, and it would have accomplished what it set out to do. But instead, what we got was a slugger to the gut. One of the finest casts I've ever seen in a film with each one bringing their A game would have been enough as well (and we got just that), but NO. The writers decided to ALSO hit us with a death blow to Aunt May, fulfilled character arcs for several characters--in this universe and others--and the perfect conclusion to Tom Holland's Peter Parker trilogy wrapped in gut-wrenching depression with a tinge of bittersweet satisfaction. The MCU Spider-Man saga could have ended here and I'd have been blown away ultimately, but they still intend to do more with this character going forward: this poor, distraught, heroic, broken, courageous boy who sacrificed literally everything to be the hero the world needed in that moment. He carries the burdens of his failures into a world where no one else will have to face the ramifications of them but himself. I am still feeling pain for Peter, and I did not go into this calling myself a Spider-Man fan. This film has made me one, and I love it to my core.What I liked most were the acting performances, most notably from Andrew Garfield, Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, and Tom Holland (who has his career performance to date in this film). Andrew's Peter got a wonderful completion to his forgotten saga and Tobey's Peter is clearly arced during this film, and he plays the role of the elder Spider-Man excellently. I also loved the execution of Aunt May's death. They made her relevant in a believable way and gave her the end that would propel this Spider-Man into a league of his own. The thematic conclusion for Tom's Peter was the cherry on top of a bombastic, yet darker blockbuster epic.The elements I was not a fan of, however, were the way in which the Spider-Mans were introduced, some of the villains having questionable motives, and the fact that I'm still nervous about what this does to the MCU as a whole, but probably only because I have no real idea where they go from here with Peter, and I have my concerns about what they might be gearing up to do, but I'll hold my breath until the next one. There were also some sloppy editing moments, especially in the final one-on-one fight with the Green Goblin. But ultimately I can look past a lot of the heavy CGI and excessive action-sequence cuts because there were far more strong suits, such as the CGI fight with Doctor Strange that had little to no cuts at all and was a beautiful sequence.All in all, this was a spectacular film for what I went in expecting. Not a perfect one, but if you're expecting the Godfather, you're in the wrong theater. This is a fun, colorful, exciting, eventful, emotional flick that should have any moviegoer pleased with the result. Marvel still deeply cares about its work some thirteen years later, and that does put a smile on my cynical face. For me, it gets a 9.2/10.FULL SCORE:Production: 22/30--Acting: 8/10--Direction: 7/10--Crew/Effects: 7/10Story: 26/30--Plot: 9/10--Characters: 9/10--Theme: 8/10Immersion: 24/30--Soundtrack: 7/10--Visuals: 8/10--Style/Vibe: 9/10Personal Enjoyment: 9.2/10Analytical Score: 81.2% B(S: 96-100A: 87-94B: 75-84C: 65-74D: 55-64F: 0-54)",

Its like they saw how people reacted to the end of End Game and thought \"hells yeah lets PUMP this movie FULL of it\". The jokes and gags were funny as always.

The story is quite bad; no multiverse film has managed to create a good, interesting story so I am not surprised that this film failed too. The first hour is incredibly dull and uninspiring; it does nothing unique or interesting. The returning villains are somehow swept aside as if they are just playthings. They take no longer than 5-10 minutes to defeat which is crazy considering there was once a whole film dedicated completely to them. Tom Holland's Spiderman isn't this powerful, its just a bit ridiculous. The film gets better in the the second half when the other spidermen come into the film. They really transform the film and create the best moments. Andrew Garfield's and Tobey Maguire's spidermen have amazing chemistry and really improved the film. Tom Holland's spiderman is, simply put, dull compared to the other actors' adaptations. Aunt May's death means nothing; we barely know her so why would we care so it wasn't sad at all. The only part of the film that was sad was when Andrew Garfield's spiderman saved MJ as he was finally strong enough to save someone spiderman loved. Despite these criticisms the film isn't bad; the other spidermen turn the film from mediocre (rating of 5) to quite good (rating of 6). There were some really good moments but the film suffered from a bad story and a poor portrayal of spiderman from Tom Holland. I'm not saying he is a bad spiderman because he's not but his story just doesn't appeal to me, its nothing that hasn't already been seen and is just boring.Overall, the films ok with some good moments sprinkled towards the end of the film.",

Also, you need to ignore that Spider-man (at least one of them) gets innocent people killed yet just shrugs it off.  Nice to see that heroes do not blame themselves for reckless behavior.  The excuse of many defenders of this movie is that they had \"good intentions\" and this just shines a light on modern society and it's failure to understand that is not acceptable, especially for a hero.",

I've seen the character in so many different formsIt's likely not too much of a stretch to say that Spider-Man could be the most widely marketed superhero of all time, with only maybe Batman giving him a run for his money in that department. I've seen the character in so many different forms and incarnations over the years that after Far From Home I honestly thought I was getting Spider-Man'd out. Upon finishing this however, I'm now wondering if instead I'm just not that much of a fan of the MCU's take. Seeing all the bits and pieces pulled from the previous silver screen adaptations of Peter Parker made me realize exactly how much I'd be down for a fourth Raimi movie or even a third Amazing. Another Tom Holland standalone though? Despite loving Homecoming and there being nothing inherently wrong with this or its other direct sequel, I'd pass in favor of seeing his story continue in one the universe's shared outings for a few reasons.The first might simply be Jon Watts. It's no secret that when you sit down to watch a Marvel flick you're in for lengthy ride. Their very best releases however are able to somewhat prevent you from realizing this in the moment by how well they keep you engaged with the studio's established mix of humor, heart, and action. Watts is using the exact same formula, but has been unable since his first entry to apply it a manner that's kept me from feeling every excruciatingly long second of the 2 hour+ running-times in either of his two Home (Far From and now No Way) follow-ups. Then there's the supporting cast. I don't care about the likes of Ned Leeds or \"Happy\" Hogan the way I have the Harry Osborns and Gwen Stacys of the past, while the original interpretations of returning staples such as Aunt May and MJ are nowhere near as endearing. An unfortunate fact given what a large role they all play in these films and probably the best example of how not every aspect of the MCU's unique vision for Spider-Man has been for the better.None of that is to say this isn't worth watching. It's just what kept the biggest MCU event since Endgame from hitting home with me personally. When it's delivering on all of its wildest rumors however, even I was elated. Not every of promise gets fulfilled as it turns out stuff like the mid-credits scene in Let There Be Carnage was a complete waste of everyone's time, but there's enough here to make for a longtime Spidey fan's ultimate wet dream. I particularly loved how it gave me the slightest bit of insight into what the lives of certain characters were like after where they ended up the last time I got to see them onscreen. The whole thing also serves as a soft reboot of the titular hero that takes him back to his roots so the future is as always open to a wide range of interesting possibilities. Whether one of those potential directions it can go in will cause me to finally embrace Holland the way I did Tobey and, yes, even Garfield is another matter, but at least my curiosity as to what may come next has cautiously been piqued following a period when it had waned almost entirely.",

And now that the movie came out I can sadly say that it did not deliver.Some aspects of the movie like the acting are very good. Dafoe is easily the best actor here able to portray Norman Osborne in a way very similar to a dementia patient lost in the world. Tobey is able to accurately portray an older wiser Spiderman, and Garfield is able to pull off the pain of losing Gwen well still nearly a decade later. Other aspects like the narrative are not as good. The story is jumbled and kind of stupid. we need to fix all the villains? This is a mind numbingly dumb idea. Furthermore the overarching reveal that the entire MCU Spiderman trilogy is an origin story was a bad choice. There was no reason to essentially yeet MJ and Ned. The movie now seems in retrospect to be a bizzaro soft reboot of the MCU Spiderman series more inline with being an MCU Tobey than its own thing. We also did not need another \"with great power comes great responsibility\" scene. This was a misstep. Part of why the first MCU Spiderman movie was good was due to that overplayed cliché scene not being in that movie. I don't care for the saying, I have known about this for over 2 decades, lets move on. Something that again the first MCU Spiderman did well, I just assumed Peter in that movie already heard the speech because the audience already has. The fan service while being fun was also overplayed. Felt like an episode of full house with my theater clapping every 3 seconds because of some random reference. Overall I did like it, but it is the worst of the 3 MCU Spiderman movies. If you turn your brain off and get happy at 1000 references then you'll like the movie. I would give it a 3/5 (6.5/10)Side note:Aunt May's death was one of the funniest things about the movie. She gets suplexed by the glider, blown up, and then walks around for a few minutes and then dies after the cliché \"great power\" spiel. I was laughing the entire time. Less is more guys, she could have just been stabbed or something we didn't need an entire production for her death",

As a result, the silly scenes feel awkward, and the drama heavy scenes fall completely flat. The entire plot is pulled along by a string of increasingly convoluted deus ex machinas, all under the pseudo-scientific guises of \"string theory\", \"the multiverse\", \"magic\", and \"making/repairing something powerful in the lab\".  The sheer number of these absurd devices makes the entire plot and all of the character motivations mostly incomprehensible by the halfway point.By the end of the movie I was left feeling like Spider-Man was an annoying, egocentric, and self-righteous little jerk, and that I really didn't care at all about any of the other characters.  The movie boils down to a 2-hour-long slog of flimsy fan service and nostalgia baiting for the Spider-Man franchise.  But hey, it's a perfectly valid, focus-group-tested recipe for butts in seats that all but guarantees a profit.",

The story makes no sense. Spiderman has to get together all of the anomalies from other dimensions so Dr. Strange can make a spell to send them back? So, he gets together all of these villains who are from other dimensions, and he makes this spell, and he's about to hit it and Spiderman decides he doesn't want to because he kills them in other universes. Ok. Understandable. He's a hero. But wait. We find out he didn't get all of them together. There were 2 spidermans who were also from another dimension in this dimension. Wait. Why weren't they needed for Dr. Strange to make that spell? Wait. They don't all have to be in the same place at all for this spell to work either? Then why did we round them up in cells? I'm so confused. Okay, let's ignore all of that. If you saw this movie, remember when Aunt May dies, Spiderman very clearly gets shot in the shoulder. Somehow he instantly heals from that and we hear nothing of it again. He just chills on a rooftop, logistically bleeding out. But the movie just kind of forgot they made him get shot in the shoulder.Dr. Strange gets defeated in his own mirror world, where he controls everything and is invincible. Tobey survives being stabbed & surviving like it's nothing ruining a high stakes, tragic, heartfelt death scene that could only have logically been stopped because they need him for a future multiverse movie one would presume. (Dr Strange and the MoM anyone?) Electro makes previous Spiderman go unconscious with a single zap, and moves at the speed of light so he can only dodge him with his Spidey sense. This electro is even stronger due to Tony Stark's technology, but cannot kill a Spiderman or even make them unconscious with a solid minute of screen time zapping him.Let's talk about how out of character the news guy became. He went from needing to literally show up and use helicopters to aggressively film spidermans every move, to suddenly upon hearing spiderman taunt death onto his opponents at the statue of liberty being completely absent. What the heck happened? The writers didn't want a character they made to inconvenience your climactic end fight so they had to make the character act in ways he normally wouldn't. That's just garbage writing.I'm not even going to touch on how illogical this spell is when people remember spiderman, but don't remember peter parker. It's just confusing as to how the story would have gotten to where it is without that memory when it comes to people like Happy, Aunt May, his friends, etc. and the more you think about it the more you'll want to rip your hair out so let's skip that garbage fire.The entire movie was designed to give fan service at the cost of a great story like we had in the previous movie Far from Home.The redeeming qualities are the great fight scenes, seeing 3 spidermans we're familiar with interact and share the screen together, and Willem Dafoe's amazing oscar level acting in this movie. I give it 3 or 4 stars out of 10.",

He goes to Doctor Strange to cast a spell to make everyone forget he's Spider-Man. Strange casts the spell but it is tampered with by Peter so that other unwanted characters come through. Alfred Molina returns as Doctor Octopus and Willem Dafoe comes back as Green Goblin. The best part of the movie was having all these characters from previous franchises come back. Sandman, Lizard, and Electro were re-introduced, and they were all portrayed by their former cast members. It was also cool seeing Tobey's Spider-Man again and Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man and I liked how they are given a real role in the film. The movie ends bittersweet with Peter and MJ going off to college, having had her memory of Spider-Man being Peter erased. There are potential routes the series could go from here, one is a symbiote storyline which is winked at after the credits. Kraven the Hunter, Hydroman, Shocker and Black Cat could be introduced.

We've waited a long time for this movie to come out, and it's finally here. Judging by the ticket sales and packed theaters, you may have already seen this movie. Let's see what Tom Holland and crew have for us on this record-breaking weekend.No Way Home is a continuation from where Far From Home left off. This review may contain some spoilers about the previous movies, but it's nothing that you couldn't get from the trailer. Check out the trailer below. Also, what's wrong with you?! Why haven't you seen the new iterations of your friendly neighborhood Spider-man? Shame on you! Anyway, you're here now and it's not too late to catch up on the MCU but, particularly, the Spider-Man trilogy with Tom Holland.This third episode of Spider-Man just continues the hope that Disney and Sony can figure out these rights so that the MCU can have all of its necessary parts. Here, the viewer of this movie, whether fan or general audience member, can enjoy it. This movie has a nice but interesting mix of nostalgia and forward thinking. We get blasts from the past but also a story that mixes the current with the prospective future. This is clearly what Kevin Feige has been really good at with the phases of the MCU. No Way Home, strangely, had a similar Infinity War feel to it as well. There's a culmination of the years of Spider-Man made into one cohesive story. The story as a whole isn't that great but the execution was excellent. It takes you from the high of highs to the low of lows back up and down like a yo-yo. Plus, there are moments of legit comedy. For those that care, I can absolutely see you catching that thug tear in your eye at multiple moments throughout the movie. Ultimately, the end product just feels good and gives those who want to stay truer to the Spider-Man character hope and relief. This may sound very vague but it's hard to not spoil this movie when it has so much excitement to it.Now, the cast as a whole is huge. Disney has sooo much money to spend, it's unreal. You have Jamie Foxx, Alfred Molina, Willem Dafoe, and J. K. Simmons, in the cast and they aren't even the main characters. This cast definitely has enough cash to find a way home. As a whole, there are many poignant and heartfelt moments led by Tom Holland and Zendaya. There are also a couple weird moments where you'll feel awkward, but strangely enough, Spider-Man is supposed to be a bit awkward and offbeat; so, even when things aren't working, IT STRANGELY WORKS. This movie just works. It's Spider-Man to the multiverse max. Full of fanfare with the cast and the storyline and I'm sure there is more to come.Long story short, this is no Miles Morales Spiderverse but for a live action sequel this is exactly what we deserve. Spider-Man: No Way Home while it somehow found a way to get a bit slow in the middle, the stakes in a single hero movie have never been bigger. The cast is huge. The stakes are huge. The impact on the MCU will be huge as well. Overall, Spider-Man: No Way Home is just a blockbuster you must see with a big box of fresh popcorn.",

First off the tone is dark and most of the comedy in this movie is done much better then most of the childish MCU movies. 2nd the tone is very dark at times and it really gives Tom Holland Peter Parker depth. Also the villains especially Green Goblin were all fantastic as they have understandable motivations and are developed decently. The story and plot, as well as the pacing are all pretty decent. The soundtrack in this movie was great way better then the two Tom Holland movies. The action is all breathtaking and the fan service in this movie is very well done, much better then Endgame imo.",
