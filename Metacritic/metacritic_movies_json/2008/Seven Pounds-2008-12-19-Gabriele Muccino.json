    "summary": "Ben Thomas is an IRS agent with a fateful secret who embarks on an extraordinary journey of redemption by forever changing the lives of seven strangers. (Sony Pictures)",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "A movie that plays better if you know nothing about it going in.",
        "Now, with Seven Pounds, the transformation of Will Smith is complete: Gone is any trace of love-me impishness, replaced by one of the sourest pusses Hollywood has seen since Joaquin Phoenix got his Screen Actors Guild card.",
        "Gripping but gap-filled Seven Pounds will have half your brain asking \"How could this be?\" and the other half saying, \"Shut up and go along for the ride!\" Listen to the latter voice.",
        "Some people will find it emotionally manipulative. Some people like to be emotionally manipulated. I do, when it's done well.",
        "A spiritual successor to \"The Pursuit of Happyness,\" but darker and more oblique.",
        "Seven Pounds works better the more the viewer feels and the less he/she thinks. On an emotional level, one could decree that the movie is satisfying. On an intellectual level, it's disappointingly shallow.",
        "While it doesn't break any new ground or provide any revelations, Seven Pounds is unabashedly emotional and cautiously hopeful. It's the feel-good movie for these feel-bad times.",
        "The film's Italian director does achieve in his second American outing a pleasing blend of Hollywood professional sheen and European sensitivity to character details and nuances.",
        "The movie is pretty unabashed about the all-but-corny sentiment: Each of us has something to give.",
        "This is what lifts Seven Pounds above other Smith dramas -- he does tentatively allow another adult onto his solitary planet.",
        "Seven Pounds is the very definition of a 'noble failure.'",
        "It's a con job that feels like a precisely attenuated work of art, elegantly weaving flashbacks and ellipses into the story in an effort to conceal how shamelessly manipulative it is in the end. And as always, Smith comes out a winner.",
        "Seven Pounds is one part jigsaw puzzle, one part \"The Giving Tree\" and both parts marinated in melancholy.",
        "The movie gets just enough right that the things it doesn't get right (beyond its overdependence on a not-so-surprising story puzzle) smack you cold in the face.",
        "As written, Seven Pounds would have always been a melancholy experience, but a lighter touch would have helped to keep you from noticing the implausibility of its plot.",
        "I'd like to make a 911 call myself: Lord, please stop this increasingly fine actor (Smith) from climbing onto another cross.",
        "Dawson is lovely to watch, and when Smith isn't furrowing his brow and looking concerned, he's not so bad himself.",
        "There's a head-pounding, gob-smacking literalness to this flick, extending from the title right through to the recurring imagery.",
        "Seven Pounds, coming after \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" and \"I Am Legend,\" seems like the third in a trilogy of inspirational bummers.",
        "Saintliness is a heavy burden to carry, and Smith can't help but buckle a bit. He's always interesting to watch, but crafting a real person out of his cardboard character proves an impossible task.",
        "A collage of strong scenes, dull bits, good filmmaking and a dissatisfying emotional payoff. A laudable attempt to tackle heavyweight subject-matter that ends up just being heavy weather.",
        "Seven Pounds has a heart as big as all outdoors. Unfortunately it's made out of high-fructose bull.",
        "Preposterous romantic melodrama, which uses a fractured narrative to cloud an absurd plot that would probably be laughed off the screen if it were presented in a straightforward manner.",
        "Contrived hunk of feel-good.",
        "An unintentionally ludicrous drama of repentance.",
        "An insult to the intelligence of most moviegoers.",
        "The whole narrative is too hollow and rickety as well as gimmicky for Muccino to breathe much life into it.",
        "An endlessly sentimental fable about sacrifice and redemption that aims only at the heart at the expense of the head. Intricately constructed so as to infuriate anyone predominantly guided by rationality and intellect.",
        "The rest of Seven Pounds feels like a half-hour \"Twilight Zone\" script that has been pressed onto a gob of Silly Putty and stretched to the sinking point.",
        "Mr. Smith's latest film is about nothing less than life and death, sin and atonement, and it takes the soggy cake for multiple layers of sentimentality topped by indigestible grandiosity.",
        "Overall Seven Pounds is too heavy-handed and maudlin to be comprehensible, let alone moving. The real shocker is that not even Smith can rescue it.",
        "Dispiritingly obvious and phony from top to bottom.",
        "The most transcendently, eye-poppingly, call-your-friend-ranting-in-the-middle-of-the-night-just-to-go-over-it-one-more-time crazily awful motion pictures ever made."

The film is a one-trick pony that is simply frustrating after the trick is figured out-- which, honestly, is about 30 seconds into the film. Will Smith is great actor to watch, but he and this threadbare concept movie are simply trying too hard to be \"significant.\" Maybe its time to attack a story with meat on its bones or do an outright comedy to exhibit your ample charm again, Mr. Smith. Leave the over-emotional melodrama to the daytime TV guys and gals.",

The writers could have made him a really good character but in the end they just made him hateful and bitter, meaning that we don't care about his problems. I understand that he has to be depressing to a certain level but this was unbearable.

I am very cinical when it comes to movies and I hate bla bla love bla bla romance. BUT... this is not about it. This is WAY beyound our idea of a movie about love and romance. Maybe that's why there are these terrible reviews - in a world full of copied.past scripts and never-ending possibilities with new technology, thus creating virtual (alternative) realities, I think people are losing the real sense of A movie. I can relate so much about it... It is NOT a film without grip of reality - I LIVE a reality very near to this one and it really blew my mind. Of course the movie is \"elongated\". You have to feel it - unlike other common movies about an alien adventure where you except frames to fly around like crazy. The critics MUST take a break from this technology-based imagery we're living in so that we can appreciate, again, the beauty of thinking and living - experiencing. One of my favorite movies ever - and I don't remember a single one I like with feelings of courage or redemption or whatever. The casting is great and Oh Boy Will Smith gives it all. WELL DONE",

He recites the names after berating a beef salesman, a blind beef salesman; he recites the names as a preventive measure against tears. Surely, this is a flashback, back when Ben was an ass**** who worked for an astronautical company. We're not sure because \"Seven Pounds\" tells its story non-linearly; it's a good thing, too, that the movie throws a little heavy lifting our way, because a straightforward rendering would have yielded this fundamental question from the audience a lot sooner: \"Why doesn't Ben help the families of the victims instead of these complete strangers?\" No. Ben's berating of the blind beef salesman is not a flashback. He's the subject of a George Harrison-penned \"Revolver\" track now. The slumming MIT grad likes to test people whom the IRS red-flagged as potential tax-cheats, then the depressed and self-righteous civil servant decides to go ahead with the audit, or deems them worthy of a six-month pardon. The accident transformed Ben. While his best friend hits golf balls, the taxman opts for a loftier hobby: philanthropy. He's a pushover for tax cheats with physical abonomalies and ailments. Emily(Rosario Dawson) has a heart defect, which leads \"Seven Pounds\" to a literal interpretation of the old stand-by lyric about love and beneficience. In one extended scene, where \"Seven Pounds\" won me over, Ben eats Emily's eggplant parmesan, then hums the melody to Minnie Ripperton's \"Loving You\". The taxman knows the music, but he doesn't know the words. After they make love, the words come to Ben. And suddenly he knows what to do with his heart. Despite the inanity of the story's basic premise, this tearjerker gets one thing right, and it has nothing to do with box jellyfish.",
