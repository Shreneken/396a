    "critic_reviews": [
        "The captain narrates in a punchy, journalistic style that gives Elite Squad an air of sociological realism--it bears a resemblance to viscerally exciting seventies urban thrillers like \"The French Connection.\"",
        "This latest pounding slice-of-thug-life thriller from Brazil packs the same cinematic firepower as \"City of God,\" only on the other side of the law.",
        "A one-note celebration of violence-for-good that plays like a recruitment film for fascist thugs.",
        "Poorly structured and at times incoherent.",
        "It boggles the mind to think that Elite Squad won the top prize at the prestigious Berlin Film Festival in February.",
        "Pokes and prods the viewer to watch the brutal, indiscriminate methods of Rio's SWAT-like cops and then demands only one conclusion: That cops in Rio's drug-infested slums must do what they do and if that means rampant point-blank executions, so be it.",
        "A relentlessly ugly, unpleasant, often incoherent assault on the senses from Brazil."

It is an espectacular thriller with both extraordinary history and action (the action scenes done by the same guy of \"BlackHawk Down\") - the relation between the caracters resembles \"Training Day\", but the movie is mainly a portrait of real life in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro. It does not reflect any opinion about violence, but describes the enviroment by the point of view of one the characters, cap. Nascimento. The movie leaves to the audience to analyse and make his own conclusions. To call it \"fascist propaganda\" is an absurd, paranoid mistake. It's just ignorance.",

From the 7 critics reviews, gave it a rating below 30 (out of 100) and the consensus of the bad reviews seems to be because the movie is too violent? or ugly? This is a crime action thriller, you should expect it to be violent. But different from most nowadays hollywood action thrillers (ahhh, how I mourn the day of movies like Goodfellas), this movie tries to be realistic and does have a very engaging story (although mr. Bennet from the Hollywood Reporter thought it was poorly structured and incoherent...... I wonder if he was watching the same movie as me, I found the story to be clear and well told. Then again he gave 100 score to Mamma Mia). This is a fantastic and unique movie, and to me among the best of the last decades. Forget this critics, from what I can see, they simply are not used to movies that out of the hollywood patterns. Whenever you have the chance, pick up this one and watch it, preferentially with portuguese audio and english subtitles.",

The real intention of the film is to reveal 'institutionalised' economic protection of the rich by denigrating the poor, brutalising them and their living conditions and for Brazlians to dig a little deeper into why that is so. The disparity over education and self-interest in the film was palpable. For every 'tourist' who has stood in the evening in downtown historic Rio and watched in disbelief as the flares of high velocity weapons streak across the sky from one hillside This is a real 'civil war', but it is on a class basis as much as the competative efforts of the 'feral children' being given a choice between 'charity' from the feckless rich or a very 'capitalist' way to earn their living.",

You're both. . .just awful.\" Let me start off by saying that, I completely and totally recognize my fortune in hailing from a country that has nowhere near the amount of troubles as the one depicted here, but when it comes to the role of the police in society, it's not as if that concept's never come up out here in The States. And though I'll almost always root for the guys on the right side of the law in a movie, it was genuinely difficult to like -- or let alone get to know -- any of the characters in this. When it's not busy being downright ugly and brutal, \"Elite Squad\" is sowing the seeds of an eventual scene that's ugly and brutal. Yes, it helps that we have characters admitting they regret doing the things we see them do. Yes, I understand the juxtaposition of the BOPE's actions vs. the cartel's. Did that all add up to an enjoyable, enthralling watch? Not really.",

If you are a non latin american millenial with a closed mind, I would not recommend this to you. It is a thriller movie that happens in the 90's and it's not about the police abuse or the senseless war against the drugs, but how the state uses them and the effects it has on captain's mind, who wants out no matter what. It's a harsh movie that shows the other side of a battle where everyone is a victim, but the rich. The way the story is told is really good, like a journalistic documentary, and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next.",
