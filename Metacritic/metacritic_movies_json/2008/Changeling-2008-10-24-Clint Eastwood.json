  "summary": "Los Angeles, 1928: On a Saturday morning in a working-class suburb, Christine said goodbye to her son, Walter, and left for work. When she came home, she discovered he had vanished. A fruitless search ensues, and months later, a boy claiming to be the nine-year-old is returned. Dazed by the swirl of cops, reporters and her conflictedLos Angeles, 1928: On a Saturday morning in a working-class suburb, Christine said goodbye to her son, Walter, and left for work. When she came home, she discovered he had vanished. A fruitless search ensues, and months later, a boy claiming to be the nine-year-old is returned. Dazed by the swirl of cops, reporters and her conflicted emotions, Christine allows him to stay overnight. But in her heart, she knows he is not Walter. As she pushes authorities to keep looking, she learns that in Prohibition-era L.A., women don't challenge the system and live to tell their story. Slandered as delusional and unfit, Christine finds an ally in activist Reverend Briegleb, who helps her fight the city to look for her missing boy. Based on the actual incident that rocked California's legal system, Changeling tells the shocking tale of a mother's quest to find her son, and those who won't stop until they silence her.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "Emotionally powerful and stylistically sure-handed, this true story-inspired drama begins small with the disappearance of a young boy, only to gradually fan out to become a comprehensive critique of the entire power structure of Los Angeles, circa 1928.",
    "A disturbing film about grim subject matter, but the overall experience is more exhilarating than saddening. There's just something satisfying about seeing a movie so well made.",
    "A compelling, adult period thriller, with an Oscar-assured performance from Angelina Jolie.",
    "Changeling doesn't care if you love it or hate it, it makes no compromises to fashion and it's charged with that unmistakable assurance of a master filmmaker at his creative peak.",
    "In Changeling Eastwood continues to probe uncomfortable subjects to depict the individual and even existential struggle to do what is right.",
    "Eastwood tells his haunting, sorrowful saga with such a sure, steady hand, only a very hardened cynic could fail to be moved.",
    "This incredible but true story marks the first time Eastwood's signature themes have found expression in a woman's experience, and the absence of any distracting machismo only heightens his sense of helpless rage at the perpetual anguish of victims' families.",
    "Jolie, Malkovich and Geoff Pierson, as a lawyer who takes Collins' case before the Police Board, are very good at what they do very well. The film's most riveting performance is by Jason Butler Harner as the murderous Gordon Northcott.",
    "Jolie is inspired casting. She plays the role like a gathering storm, moving from terror to a fierce resolve. And Eastwood, at the peak of his artful powers, tightens the screws of suspense without ever forgetting where the heart of his film lies.",
    "Another remarkable addition to Eastwood's directorial canon.",
    "In other hands, these clashes of good and evil might have seemed ordinary, but Eastwood makes Changeling a hard story to shake off. To see this film is to understand both how fragile and how essential our hopes for decency and truth are in a world that must be made to care about either one.",
    "Changeling is an almost universally impressive all-around effort, and is the best \"dirty underbelly of Los Angeles\" movie since \"L.A. Confidential.\"",
    "Changeling fundamentally works; it holds you. But these  issues of texture and detail matter  too, and they hold clues as to why Eastwood's latest is a good, solid achievement rather than a great, grieving one.",
    "Eastwood creates a tone that's at once stately and unsettling, allowing a lot of breathing room for Jolie's sad, unyielding performance. She anchors a film that needs an anchor the further it goes along.",
    "The movie has an epic sweep but an intimate, personal feel. If Changeling lacks the knockout power of, say, \"Million Dollar Baby,\" it proves that Eastwood continues to seek out stories that take him places he hasn't been before -- and the audience along with him.",
    "Changeling is beautifully wrought, but it has the abiding fault of righteously indignant filmmaking: it congratulates us for feeling what we already feel.",
    "In its purposeful accumulation of depravities, both individual and institutional, the director's non-style has an honorable payoff that's rare in modern Hollywood cinema: the story's weight could come close to burying you in despair.",
    "Eastwood gets all noirish for us but, like Jolie's performance, there's a rote quality to it all. Even the mournful little ditties that Eastwood composed for the soundtrack seem canned.",
    "While the neo-Gothic tale is inherently intriguing, the film should inspire strong emotion, but deliberate pacing and a contained sense of melodrama make it a surprisingly passive experience.",
    "No matter how strange it gets, or how distorted for political gain or refined for religious purposes, its essence is hard to pin down, even after a 2 1/2 -hour search.",
    "While components of Eastwood's film are excellent, in particular Kelly's quietly tenacious performance and the evocative period details, Changeling is a film of parts, not a unified whole.",
    "While Straczynski should be commended for remaining reasonably true to the historical record, this results in an open-ended conclusion that isn't entirely satisfying.",
    "Perhaps with a few more drafts, the filmmakers could have found a means of maintaining the quiet momentum displayed early on, but as it stands, Changeling is little more than a frustrating missed opportunity that's dressed to the nines, but a day late for the party.",
    "All of Eastwood's rigorous craftsmanship seems wasted on a movie whose message never rises above the bumper-sticker admonition that \"mean people suck.\"",
    "The script is compelling, the direction confident, the production values professional. But it does not, in the end, feel real.",
    "Burdened by a convoluted script and an ensemble-proof leading lady, the director fails to illuminate a particular corrupt system.",
    "The trouble with Changeling is that it plays less like reality than like a bare-bones, moralistic rehash of other, better movies, such as \"L.A. Confidential\" or \"Frances.\"",
    "Biblically classical, tastefully vintage with aerial shots of wet umbrellas and Homburg hats and not a little staid considering its sensational source material, Changeling isn't so much dull as it is an open book.",
    "Despite a mysterious title, Changeling isn't a mystery. It is, occasionally, agony.",
    "The truth about the case of Christine Collins is so shocking and dramatic that embellishment must have seemed pointless, but in sticking so close to the historical record, Mr. Straczynski and Mr. Eastwood have produced a distended, awkward narrative whose strongest themes are lost in the murky pomp of period detail.",
    "As Changeling strains toward its mawkishly optimistic conclusion, the old-fashioned moviemaking that Eastwood settled into doesn't suit either him or his star. It feels like a corny joke.",
    "Eastwood's grim handling of even grimmer subject matter could have used some paring down toward its histrionic ending, but Changeling is still one of the director's most assured and engaging historical horror shows.",
    "An extremely weird and frustrating viewing experience. I think it's that way because Eastwood, 78, can't be bothered to wrangle the vast material into a tighter shape.",
    "The result is a film that plays like a creaking melodrama, with good guys and bad guys and precious little in between.",
    "A glum, listless affair that springs to life now and then, only to sag back into its saggy, depressive cushion.",
    "A brazen title card declares this \" true story.\" (Wow, not even \"based on.\") However many facts may be accurate, the movie feels contrived, with climax piled upon climax.",
    "It would be a horrific story even if underplayed, but Eastwood shoots it like a horror movie.",
    "J. Michael Straczynski's disjointed script manages to ring false at almost every significant turn (Collins' psychiatric-hospital stay has grown into a latter-day version of \"The Snake Pit\") and Clint Eastwood's ponderous direction -- a disheartening departure from his sure touch in \"Letters From Iwo Jima\" and \"The Bridges of Madison County\" -- magnifies the flaws."

And every one of these horribly cheesy lines is delivered by a walking piece of cardboard character. Jolie, cue the tears, nominated for best actress? Please, maybe a nomination for best weight-loss not required by a role. The only engaging character of the movie was the killer himself, who imbued his part with the appropriate creepiness that this movie fully deserved.

The boy is not her son, she takes him home anyway...Â¤Â¤ Really?

Why family members, neighbors, school chums, the family physician, the baby sitter and E.T. the Extraterrestrial weren't asked to help resolve the obvious misconception on the part of the police, was conveniently left out of the tale completely. No, in stead of taking the boy into custody and resuming the search for the real son, the police keep pushing her into believing it actually is her son after which the woman finds herself in a poorly copied tale by Kafka. From this point on the movie reveals itself for what it was intended to be. An endless string of manipulative scenes drenched in an Oscar vinaigrette in both the melodramatic writing and the obnoxiously polished cinematography with a fetish-like attention to props.

SkillfullyI confess that I was not expecting this film to be so interesting. It's truly awesome. Partly based on a true case that took place about a hundred years ago, the film is loaded with feelings that are difficult to digest and absorb. Skillfully directed by Clint Eastwood, who once again presents us with a piece of great technical quality and good dramatic sense, the film is absolutely memorable.The script is the main strength of the film, and it's really worth highlighting. I think it is really difficult to remain indifferent to a story so fraught with suffering and where the police are so deserving of censorship. The whole story revolves around the disappearance of a child and the incessant search for its mother, against all expectations and against the will of the authorities themselves, who presented a child to her as their child and never took it seriously when the mother said not to be the right child. It is a well-written and skillfully developed script.Another aspect that deserves positive mention is the colossal and talented work of Angelina Jolie in the main role. She has, on several occasions, already shown us her talent, this is nothing new, but it is always pleasant to see a great actress giving us another excellent performance. Here, the actress was perfectly able to clearly express that mother's mental anguish and psychological torture. In addition, the film also has an excellent contribution from John Malkovich, in the role of a religious pastor who is determined to help that mother by seeing her as a victim of arrogant and cruel police, and Colm Feore, in the role of the Police commander, ultimately responsible for their mistakes and negligence.Technically, it's a film that has excellent production values. The film is not long and the pace is excellent, allowing each point of the plot to get its best development. Being a period film, the sets and costumes take on greater relevance, and were excellent in the task of contextualizing the audience and the story in time and space. Finally, a word of appreciation for the great soundtrack.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nAngelina Jolie gives a good performance in this movie as the rightfully upset and very frustrated Christine Collins, who is determined to find her son and highlight how crooked the LAPD is/was. This movie is apparently based on a true story set in the late 1920s and it certainly puts a chill down your spine to see the sorts of things that went on, with the LAPDs treatment of women. Its a reflection of the times in terms of sexism in a more general way as well, I feel, not just in relation to the LAPD specifically but obviously back then women had less rights and men would probably think less of them than now, things weren't as equal for the sexes as they are now. Its quite disturbing to see the scenes set in the psych ward and to learn what we learn - certainly the term abuse of power is valid and indeed its the main theme present in this movie. I think Christine is, in a way, a hero figure, certainly to other women, who will likely be able to identify with her, especially mothers and single mothers - to go through the trauma of losing your only child is clearly a very upsetting and worrying ordeal but to be presented, months after the disappearance, with a child who your sure isn't your own flesh and blood, although the authorities won't take this and do everything in their power to persuade you otherwise - well, you can only imagine what that must be like - very troubling and frustrating. I found myself quite engrossed in this movie, sharing many of Christine's emotions, willing her to get to the bottom of what happened to her beloved son Walter while also learning with her about whats going on behind the scenes, so to speak and it was quite satisfying to see how some members of the community reacted to her plight, agreeing to help her on her mission to prove the child she'd been assured is hers, is in no way related to her. This is no mean feat and as the plot unravels, is quite shocking, disturbing even to see how far those in authority go to prove to Christine that she's wrong and given the fact that this movie claims to be based on a true story, its sad to think that such things may have happened. This is, of course, quite a dark movie and there are some scenes which make for uncomfortable viewing, including one of a person being hanged which was quite disturbing (I always thought that death was immediate from hanging but apparently not - yes, its not nice to watch) and one or two sudden flashback scenes as well. To be honest, the themes present are probably more disturbing than said scenes but I thought its worth mentioning all the same.The movie is quite long, at around about 2 hours and 20 minutes and I think it was perhaps a bit long drawn out, although on the other hand if it were cut back more than by perhaps 15 minutes or so, it may seem a bit convenient and rushed - still the story moves fairly slowly and if you rely on action and visual effects to keep you from being distracted then this might be an issue for you, not that you should expect such things from a movie like this but again, its perhaps worth mentioning. I also felt that the story was a bit unclear in one or two parts, though things became clearer later on, however I should probably admit that I had an issue with the DVD being scratched and a few times it would refuse to play and I'd have to skip the affected part on the disk so that was probably part to blame, I missed probably 10 mins max. of the movie but then in a way it was good for me as the movie ended a bit earlier than I expected overall - I still saw the majority of it and I feel I can still review it well enough. I haven't mentioned the ending yet, so I'll mention it now. I imagine that the ending divided opinon - I suppose its not dreadfully bleak yet its not fully a Hollywood ending either, in that the viewer is left with unanswered questions - even though there's an update of sorts written across the scene just before the credits roll. Ultimately, its up to you as the viewer to come to your own conclusions about certain aspects but I thought it was nice that the ending mentions what became of some characters (I suppose thats the more 'Hollywood' aspect of it).I'd recommend this movie, as I found myself quite engrossed in the story and I thought that the main character, Christine, was well portrayed and the fact that it is, apparently, based on a true story, in a way the themes present are really quite important, the messages at play are ones that people should be aware of even in the present day and for other women, it definitely makes you think about how women were perhaps perceived in the past, almost 100 years ago and the progress thats been made - although Christine was perhaps doing well as a successful businesswomen in the late 1920s which was quite possibly not often the case for women back then, the way that her actions were downplayed and perceived, it is disturbing.",
