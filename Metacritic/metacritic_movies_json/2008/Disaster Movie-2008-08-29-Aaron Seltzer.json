  "critic_reviews": [
    "The movie is merciless sending up \"Juno's\" self-satisfied hipster gobbledygook, and it's quite funny to see Hannah Montana still promoting her tie-in products as she lies crushed and dying under a meteor.",
    "The product's not 100% giggle-free: Several songs have amusing lyrics, especially parodies of \"Juno\" and \"High School Musical.\"",
    "Lazy, superficially au courant and utterly forgettable.",
    "Seldom has a pic been more appropriately titled than Disaster Movie, yet another frantically unfunny free-form farce.",
    "Real disaster movies have more laughs than this spoof.",
    "Why would you watch a bad movie about better movies, when you could just rent the originals instead?",
    "Does little more than congratulate its audience on recognizing the source of its riffs. \"High School Musical\" -- ha ha ha!",
    "A horrific waste of time, money and oxygen.",
    "It's too easy to say Disaster Movie deserves its title, but why put more effort into trashing it than the filmmakers did into writing it?",
    "The filmmakers are idiots.",
    "This carpet-fouling mongrel of a movie no more deserves release than do anthrax spores.",
    "There's no nice way to say this, so I'll just say it: Writer/directors Friedberg and Seltzer are a scourge."

No way am I paying for this crap again. I saw an ad in the paper for this film and there was a group shot of 20 characters. Not a single one of them was from a disaster film, which automatically tells me that this film sucks. How are Hellboy, Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Juno, High School Musical, Kung Fu Panda etc. disaster films? Shouldn't a film called Disaster Movie involve, oh I don't know, some kind of disaster movie parodies? You'd have to be stupid to not see how ripe that genre is for parody... well, I guess this is Frienderg and Setzer we are talking about. Also, the fact that these no-talent hacks would try to rip off films such as Hellboy, Iron Man and Kung Fu Panda, ie. REAL films made by TALENTED people, is like spitting in the face of anyone who has ever made or watched an enjoyable movie. I think the Razzies should be renamed the Friedberg/Setzer Awards, because they are clearly the people/things who personify the worst aspects of the film industry better than anyone else.",

By the hour mark, I honestly thought of running hard and far away. Hell Epic Movie was brilliant compared to this **** storm.

They could easily market this as a horror movie by putting a disclaimer saying \"Some People Actually Think This is Funny\" on the bottom of the screen as the movie plays. I know I'm being redundant but this movie is the anti-goodness. Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg have reached a level of incompetence I thought only attainable by Uwe Boll. They are hacks that have no business making movies. There isn't a single funny or redeeming \"joke\" in this movie I use the word joke loosely as i don't think anything here qualifies as a joke. Their idea of humor is to recreate that annoying AT&T cell phone commercial and replace one of the words with fuck or to make D-list celebrity jokes that have been stale for years and aren't even relevant. There is one point where a guy who is supposed to be Michael Jackson but doesn't look anything like him appears out of the trunk of Speed Racer's car with Spridel and the monkey. Genius satire right?
