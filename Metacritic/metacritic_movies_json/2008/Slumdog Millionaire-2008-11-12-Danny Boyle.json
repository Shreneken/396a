Each chapter of his story reveals the key to the answer to one of the game show\u2019s questions.

    "critic_reviews": [
        "Four stars simply aren't enough for Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire, which just may be the most entertaining movie I've ever labeled a masterpiece in these pages.",
        "This is a breathless, exciting story, heartbreaking and exhilarating at the same time.",
        "Director Danny Boyle's riveting and kaleidoscopic tale, based on Vikas Swarup's debut novel \"Q and A,\" is exquisitely adapted to the screen by Simon Beaufoy.",
        "Slumdog Millionaire is the film world's first globalized masterpiece.",
        "The story may stretch credibility until it's ready to pop its seams, but Patel conveys the simple confidence of a prodigy who has learned everything important in life, except how to lie.",
        "It doesn't happen often, but when it does, look out: a movie that rocks and rolls, that transports, startles, delights, shocks, seduces. A movie that is, quite simply, great.",
        "You may even feel like dancing in the aisles yourself. Sure, the real world doesn't always work this way. Have you forgotten that this is one of the reasons why we go to movies in the first place?",
        "Slumdog Millionaire dives headfirst into something greater than a subculture - the enormous unchronicled culture of India's mega-slums - and achieves even more sweeping impact.",
        "A terrific yarn, one so engrossing and surprising that the nature of the story's structure -- each question Jamal gets asked on the show corresponds with a traumatic or momentous moment from his childhood -- never feels like a contrived framing device.",
        "Danny Boyle's finest since \"Trainspotting.\" In fact, it's the best British/Indian gameshow-based romance of the millennium.",
        "Romantic, action-packed and always held together by an intriguing social conscience, Slumdog Millionaire is a rapturous crowd pleaser.",
        "Slumdog Millionaire features the simplest story Boyle has ever told, which may explain why its many pleasures are so pure.",
        "This is Boyle's fullest, most satisfying work and an audience-pleaser that deserves to be a big hit.",
        "An almost ridiculously ebullient Bollywood-meets-Hollywood concoction--and one of the rare \"feel-good\" movies that actually makes you feel good, as opposed to merely jerked around.",
        "Boyle has been nothing if not bold with this film. He's dared to use so many venerable movie elements it's dizzying, dared us to say we won't be moved or involved, dared us to say we're too hip to fall for tricks that are older than we are.",
        "Like all good fairy tales, this outsize celebration of perseverance and moral triumph contains within it a deeper idea -- in this case, the relative nature of what we think we know, and what's worth knowing at all. No doubt Dickens himself would approve.",
        "The whole thing is irresistibly preposterous.",
        "Like Mumbai, Slumdog pulses and throbs with raw, unadulterated life and the hope for a better Bombay, today. It's brilliant.",
        "The result is magical and life affirming, and will enrapture those who are not scared away by the mention of \"subtitles.\"",
        "Brimming with humor and heartbreak, Slumdog Millionaire meets at the border of art and commerce and lets one flow into the other as if that were the natural order of things.",
        "A great movie is something more than the sum total of all its parts, and here, the elements all come together to form a feature that speaks a universal form of optimism that isn't likely to get lost in translation, no matter where it screens, or who is watching.",
        "Boyle, one of the premier stylists in the world fills \"Slumdog\" with ebullient energy and ceaseless invention.",
        "Absolutely perfect family entertainment for anyone over the age of ten. It is a celebration of not just the usual triumph of the human spirit, but a celebration of the human experience.",
        "Despite its elements of brutality, this is a buoyant hymn to life, and a movie to celebrate.",
        "It's a stunner.",
        "Slumdog Millionaire is nothing if not an enjoyably far-fetched piece of rags-to-riches wish fulfillment.",
        "After last year's black-hearted \"No Country for Old Men,\" the Oscars may well be in the mood to embrace a fairy tale sampling every imaginable genre, with a note of triumph accompanying even the worst suffering, capped by the snazziest ending money can buy.",
        "What's perhaps most fascinating about the film is Boyle's relentless focus on the realities of present-day India as a vehicle for his spectacle and laughs.",
        "Driven by fantastic energy and a torrent of vivid images of India old and new, Slumdog Millionaire is a blast.",
        "In the end, what gives me reluctant pause about this bright, cheery, hard-to-resist movie is that its joyfulness feels more like a filmmaker's calculation than an honest cry from the heart about the human spirit (or, better yet, a moral tale).",
        "A stylish, ingeniously constructed bit of hokum, a sparkling trinket of a movie that's as implausible as it is irresistible.",
        "The movie brushes against some of India's worst social ills, but it's essentially a fairy tale.",
        "What IS surprising is the unembarrassed energy that Boyle devotes to his pursuit of the obvious; there\u2019s nothing wrong with the formulaic, it would appear, so long as you bring the formula to the boil.",
        "The entire film has the glibness of a music video. Boyle has managed to make dire poverty seem glossy.",
        "The real star of the film is not a person but a city, the vertiginous, exciting, massively overcrowded \"maximum city\" of Mumbai. On one hand, this environment of Dickensian, almost hallucinatory contrasts between rich and poor, good and evil feels perfect for Danny Boyle.",
        "Doesn't hit its stride until the last 30 minutes, and by then, it's just a little too late."

There wouldn't be a mortal on the planet called earth who could jump into **** for getting an autograph of Amitabh Bachan. And as if AB will give it as well!And I hated the dialogue when Jamal says: \"This is the real India,\" when a police constable was beating him up barbarically, and then an American interrupts and gallantly produces some dollars from his purse, saying \"Let us show him the real America.\" or something like that. That made me shut my television off. Of course the movie didn't instill any excitement when Jamal was about to answer a question on the game show. You know that it is gonna be right. But the cinematography and the background music was great. And following Jamal through his journey is not all that bad, though. It is exciting sometimes. The love story which runs parallel is somewhat fascinating.This is a movie worth watching, but don't overestimate it as an award winner. Certainly if you are a non- Indian, it would be a new experience.",

It's one ofSlumdog Millionaire is Danny Boyle's worst film so far. Boyle tried to ambitiously replicate Fernando Meirelles' City of God - a true modern masterpiece about life on the outskirts of Rio De Janeiro - but he failed miserably. It's one of those terribly cliched and predictable movies where the lovable loser wins at the end and gets the girl and the money. The acting is weak and there's a glaring lack of substance. There's not a single transformation portrayed, no character arc just an overflow of sappy moments. It doesn't resemble a shred of reality and it completely skips the true horrors of being born in poverty. I have lived in England all my life but even someone as unaware as me could point out that kids who serve tea in India with no parents don't speak in English, certainly not with hints of a British accent. The film says that the only hope to escape poverty is by fortuity and for that people flourish it with awards? Danny Boyle's crowd pleasing \"art\" film is the very definition of mediocrity. It's manipulative trash simply made for the sole purposes of winning awards.",

I SINCERELY HOPE NOT! jamal and saleem had a terrible childhood which is revealed through flashbacks as terrible\ras the things they depict, it is from these flashbacks that jamal knows all the answers to\rthe questions presented in an indian \"who wants to be a millionaire\" (which is impossble to\rcheat in, because only the host knows the questions/answers, and every variation of the show\ronly uses LANDLINES to prevent connection failure, which renders two major plot points in the film completely invalid), but the most gaping plot holes arise when two of these flashbacks DO NOT EVEN GIVE JAMAL THE ANSWER, OR THE CHANCE FOR JAMAL TO FIGURE OUT THE\rANSWER!!!\r oh, and they don't show jamal completing the general knowledge questions REQUIRED to appear\ron every variation of the show, which he would have failed at, because he is unaware that\rghandi is on every piece of indian currency (even though he clearly earns indian money\rthroughout the movie), if he doesn't know that, how much more does he not know? this alone\rrenders the ENTIRE PLOT invalid...\r jamal went on the show because latika loves the show, and he loves latika, which is oh so\rIMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE BECAUSE JAMAL AND LATIKA HAVE NO CHEMISTRY, THEY HAVE NO COMMON\rINTERESTS, THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE AN IN-DEPTH CONVERSATION IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE, this is what i meant when i said 'no logical motivation' jamal and latika are in love solely because the plot needs them to be, and dear god does it show.\r oh, and then there's the ending, now, all throughout the movie, there is a consistent theme: money is evil, so what happens...

This was one of my favorite movies of all time. It showed you just how violent and poverty-stricken the slums of India are, it showed you the fierce hatred between Hindus and Muslims, it even showed you the lives of children living in India. Apart from nerve-tingling violence (a boy getting his eyes cut out, a girl getting a knife slashed across her face, a young boy killing a man with a revolver, a young boy getting beaten harshly by a guard, people setting a man on fire, a boy getting electrocuted) there was a very strong and great message to this movie. There was also slight sexual refrences, but they were very mild (a boy leading a girl into a room, girls dancing scandaly, boys walking through an alley of prostitutes, but not giving them money, although they walk in on a couple but it does not show anything). I thought the acting in it was spectacular. The children playing young Jamal, Salim, and Latika were outstanding, convincing you they truly lived in the slums of India, as well as the older versions convincing you their lives had slowly panned out and changed them into very different people by a sequence of events. There was slight cussing as well (the b-word, d-word, and s-word said only a couple times). But the themes of the movie, you could not help but feel heartbroken at how the children were living in such a poor, violent situation. Being beaten for hardly no reason, having to search through trash heaps, live in such a polluted area...it was incredibly heart-wrenching. There are a few disturbing events, such as a boy jumping into a waste mound, a boy getting his eyes scooped out with acid, a girl dressed up as a hindu god with several disgusting piercings, a boy getting hot chili peppers stuck down his pants, and many others. But apart from the violence and slight sexual references this movie taught me how truly lucky I am to live in such a free country, where people can't take me away to try to force me into gangs to shoot people, or to work as a prostitute. It also showed that just from your experiences, even if you are a \"slumdog\" from India, if you have traveled places or learned things from your experiences, you can know just as much as a rich gameshow host. :)",

It wasn't a horrible film, but I really didn't enjoy it as much as most people do. Regarding the credibility issue, I do agree that the film needed to \"follow its own rules\" as others have said. As I understand it, the movie tries to show fantastic things happening in a gritty, realistic world. But the world itself is not realistic. Apart from minor errors in terminology, (eg. talking in terms of millions rather than crores, calling the quiz show its US/UK name rather than the Indian name, etc.), the fact that all these practically illiterate people can speak perfect English is extremely unrealistic, which foreign viewers may not realise. A lot of the plot hinges on this ability. Also, as everyone should know, the 'phone-a-friend' thing doesn't happen live with everyone watching! The person on the other end would just look up the answer online before the call is even made! The quiz show is obviously always prerecorded. I also felt that, since Jamal's love for Latika drives all his actions, it was very unconvincingly portrayed. I understand the guilt he feels for leaving her behind as a child. But guilt is not the same as love. Why does he love her as an adult after having such a flimsy friendship with her as a child? I am willing to believe it's possible, but surely the director might have fleshed it out more convincingly. Lastly, the brother's suicide was extremely unjustified, and again the director could have helped us understand it better.",

Not to mention that the point of the story completely escapes me...unless the point is depicting all the worst horrors of Indian poverty just to elicit the shock and pity of the white, Western viewer comfortably seated in a cinema chair with lots popcorn in his hand. I am forced to conclude that this is one of the main reasons why this movie got so many awards- to appease social consciousness. It seems that by patching graphic scenes of poverty and violence onto a pointless, confusing plot and a set of faceless characters, we come to what is, today, considered a highly acclaimed movie.",

Honestly I was uninterested, had no desire to see this movie and figured I would hate it. But I really started to get into it and in the end thought it was a great movie. The flashbacks made it a little confusing at times, but it was necessary for the storyline. I found this to be an intriguing love story, along with a success story proving that no matter where we come from or how bad our life has been, there is always hope for a great outcome. And that even if you come from the \"slums\" you do not have to fit a certain stereotype as Jamal's brother did. I think it's worth watching, even if you're skeptical. The only reason I gave it an 8 is because it was a bit slow to get into the meat of the story and in the beginning it was a bit choppy.",

Danny Boyle has been on a real run lately. His last 2 films, \"Millions\" and \"Sunshine\" are underrated gems that have dedicated followings but little critical recognition. \"Slumdog Millionaire\" in my opinion is probably one of the two or three best things that Boyle has ever done. The real hero of the film though is Anthony Dod Mantle. Those \"in the know\" know that Mantle is one of the best living cinematographers alive and the photography in this movie is a big part of what makes it great. The camerawork makes this film really come alive and Mantle should've been recognized more. By the Academy and the Golden Globes.",

Instead of trying to shape the thought of your nations via ignorance and the glossing Americans, Indians and their high fibre diet.... I stake my house that this movie and Benjamin Button (aka Forrest Gump Two) sweep the oscars.... Why!!?? Instead of trying to shape the thought of your nations via ignorance and the glossing over of serious issues and complex situations with superficial and insulting generalisations and inaccuarcies to suit said 'high-fibre diet' i.e., show them what makes them feel good and works, not what is true and makes one truly think and self-examine - good AND THE UGLY (and in all it's glory, not manipulated and summarised for easier consumption, you pussies).... remember when america gave all those awards to Forrest Gump? It is a silly robert zemekis fantasy movie of such incredible historical inaccuracies and crass ignorance that it is regarded by some nowadays as the worst film of all time - certainly one of the most intellectually-insulting cinematic experiences of all time.... but, oh, America the brave and the free and all things that are good.... and good 'ol india, represented by a handsome young man with good luck on his side, rising above his situation to manage to win a million dollars in an hour and have the woman of his dreams while the cities and country rot in a cess pool of rubbish, filth, human excrement and real, honest BROKEN dreams in their tens upon tens of millions..... wake up!! Danny Boyle even udnerpaid the indian mumbai orphans used int he film etc... touche. The Oscars handed about two oscars to 'No Country FOM' last year and even one critic above in reviewing 'Slumdog M' (a stupid, stupid reworking of the title \"Q and A\", but a reworking that reveals the uncomfortable contradictions inherent in the minds of the filmmakers and indeed their hearts too.... as they must manipulate, which disrespects the audience) refers to how 'after last years black-hearted NCFOM' etc etc----..WTF!!??? NCFOM is one of the greatest films ever made - indisputebly. Great art doesn't always put a smile on your face but that doesn't make it worse..... If I recall rightly, Romeo and Juliet is the greatest romance of all time and the most enduring... Tell me, how did that one turn out? Happiness is what you actually DO with your life..... art is about growing and being taken to places unexpected, being tested emotionally, intlelectually and intestinally and not giving in brainlessly to the slap and tickle you fantasized about in la-la land and then giving the piece of trash 11 oscars. Put it this way, as a NZer, Return of the King deserved about 4...... but you crazy americans get all caught up and sucked into the hype and you LOVE your high-fibre diet..... I knew when return of the king dragged on an hour too long with sentimental BS that it would sweep the oscars... SAD. Reward the best film, not the film that makes you happy - you bloody knobs.",
