Ray, still haunted by the bloodshed in London, hates the place, while Ken, even as he keeps a fatherly eye on Ray's often profanely funny exploits, finds his mind and soul being expanded by the beauty and serenity of the city. But the longer they stay waiting for Harry's call, the more surreal their experience becomes, as they find themselves in weird encounters with locals, tourists, violent medieval art, a dwarf American actor shooting a European art film, Dutch prostitutes, and a potential romance for Ray in the form of Chloe, who may have some dark secrets of her own.  And when the call from Harry does finally come, Ken and Ray's vacation becomes a life-and-death struggle of darkly comic proportions and surprisingly emotional consequences.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "An endlessly surprising, very dark, human comedy, with a plot that cannot be foreseen but only relished.",
    "The movie gradually deepens from odd-couple comedy into Catholic-themed drama, but it remains marvelously funny throughout. Instead of hitting the easy notes of black humor, McDonagh skillfully modulates between broad character laughs and the men's piercing anguish as the story nears its bloody conclusion.",
    "When it's funny, it's hilarious; when it's serious, it's powerful; and either way, it's an endless pleasant surprise.",
    "Sharply written, superbly acted, funny and even occasionally touching.",
    "Tightly scripted and intricately plotted, the buddy film manages the neat two-step of being simultaneously profane and engaging.",
    "Those who know McDonagh's work know a vein of darkness will run deeply through the comedy. It has seldom been darker. Or funnier. He has made a hit-man movie in which you don't know what will happen and can't wait to find out. Every movie should be so cliched.",
    "The heroes are two hit men, and the tone is often absurdist. But the film is also very funny and surprisingly affecting.",
    "Dark, hilarious and oddly moving.",
    "In a film full of great performances, Ralph Feinnes steals the show as Harry, the boss.",
    "With In Bruges, the British gangster movie gets a Croydon facelift. It may not be new, but it’s a wonderfully fresh take on a familiar genre: fucked-up, far-out and very, very funny.",
    "This finale, which piles one bloody absurd epiphany on top of another almost ad infinitum, is where McDonagh lays all his cards on the table -- and his characters are the ones who have to pay up.",
    "After playing one too many sullen poseurs it’s clear Colin Farrell and Ralph Fiennes had a ball making an inky black comedy seething with grandiose invective.",
    "A perfectly titled and thoroughly engaging -- if at times gleefully violent -- black comedy.",
    "A haunting and hypnotic movie, just the thing to get lost in.",
    "Witty and lively, with a soul to it, as well.",
    "Little more than a shaggy-dog tale about two hit men killing time in the picturesque, medieval Belgian city of the title, goosed with crackling dialogue and generous dollops of gore.",
    "In Bruges, at its best, works like \"Pulp Fiction\" with Irish (and Belgian) accents, digressing into weird discourse and giving a bunch of actors the occasion to shine in small, peculiar roles.",
    "Dry humor keeps In Bruges fresh and lively and makes it a whole lot of fun to watch.",
    "Chock full of wonderful lines delivered by a splendid cast, the film toys with the conventions and mostly transcends the limitations.",
    "Closer to pics like “The Hit” and “Miller’s Crossing” than to McDonagh’s bristling, funny plays, this half-comic, half-serious account of two Irish hitmen who are sent to the titular Belgian burg to cool their heels after a job is moderately fair as a nutty character study, but overly far-fetched once the action kicks in.",
    "A dark comedy with a melancholy streak and punchy sense of humor.",
    "A jolly mess of a movie. Overplotted, choppy, and contrived, it nonetheless has a curious vitality that makes you wonder where McDonagh will go next.",
    "The acting is top-notch. Colin Farrell, who seems to be gravitating increasingly toward smaller films, effectively channels his manic energy. He and Brendan Gleeson display chemistry in the Odd Couple vein, occasionally giving rise to instances of humor. Ralph Fiennes plays one of the most twisted roles of his career.",
    "The setting is unique, the cast is terrific, the dialogue crackles and, if only there were a plot worth believing, In Bruges might have been a fine film.",
    "The banter between these unlikely partners seems inspired by Quentin Tarantino's ingeniously insipid dialogue, delivered with indelible deadpan sincerity by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in \"Pulp Fiction.\" Neither the dialogue nor the characters are as interesting here.",
    "Fiennes's energy gets the film over the finish line.",
    "Mr. Gleeson, Mr. Farrell and especially the late-arriving and welcome Mr. Fiennes have great fun rummaging around inside Mr. McDonagh’s modest bag of tricks.",
    "Neither star is sloppy, but both are loose and mellow -- a couple of pros who know they're the whole show.",
    "It's a showpiece for that Belgian city's medieval splendor. You may want to book vacation reservations upon leaving the theater, although the memory of this underwhelming movie may tarnish the sightseeing.",
    "Bruges may be the movie's rather too-long-running joke, but Farrell's shaggy brow is easily the most entertaining thing in Irish playwright Martin McDonagh's first foray into the crime caper.",
    "The film's light comedy and dark morality make for an unsettling mix.",
    "As formulaic in its own way as anything mainstream Hollywood turns out, In Bruges is also a fish-out-of-water comedy.",
    "For In Bruges to click, McDonagh needed either to get more real or more fake.",
    "No one wants a movie that tiptoes in step with political correctness, yet the willful opposite can be equally noxious, and, as In Bruges barges and blusters its way through dwarf jokes, child-abuse jokes, jokes about fat black women, and moldy old jokes about Americans, it runs the risk of pleasing itself more than its paying viewers."

Farrell's caterpillar eyebrows provide the most action this movie has to offer. The running gag of making fun of Bruges (often by simply saying, \"We're in Bruges!\") was old at 10 minutes in, but dragged on for what felt like much longer than its running time. The movie draws a line through the middleground of \"dark comedy\" and leaps gracelessly back and forth across it, never managing an inspired balance between them like Pulp Fiction.

The film turns most of these on their head and offers this perhaps generational approach, like how grown up films should perhaps become.\rBrendan Gleeson is quite the calm and relaxed gentle giant of the show, is demeanour counteracts the energetic one of Farrell, whose character continuously spits out his distaste for being in Bruges and how he finds and sees everyrhing in a homosexual manner, the politest way to say it.\rIn terms of the tone, it never settles for second best, when it wants to tell a very funny joke are put across a hilarious situation, it does so without holding and punches, but when it wants to put a message of despair and emotion, it again delivers the goods without fail, showing the capabilities that Martin McDonagh possesses in story-telling but also reaching out to the audience. Many moment this film will indeed make you laugh in hysterics, but the quieter and closer moments will bring back down to reality.\rAn excellent and varied film with a taste for all sorts of genres, giving different nods to previous films and also promoting a witty script and some powerful performances.",

For example in the mediocre 2013 film The Family all of the jokes that I laughed out loud at were reasonably upbeat or dark but not black. This can be found in many other black  (I might start renaming them bleak just for literal accuracy) comedies like Thank You For Smoking, The Men Who Stare At Goats and Fargo.\rIn Bruges is an exception it has a mix of black and upbeat jokes and all of them are hilarious. Whether there about dwarves, elephants, gay beers or cupboards. Every second is hysterical. But every second is also very exciting, somehow I was even interested when Ray and Ken were discussing who's allowed to shoot themselves. Even classics like The Naked Gun and Office Space get a bit slow moving in places, this doesn't.\rThat was a great achievement and surprised me, but the most amazing thing about the writing and direction of In Bruges is that somehow Martin McDonagh makes the viewer care about the characters. Colin Farrell is a child murderer and should be one of the least likable little  in movie history. Yet somehow I was constantly rooting for him in the last 30 minutes and almost cried when he was talking to his dying partner in crime. Ralph Fiennes character Harry is even worse! And I was almost crying for him too! Hell I was almost crying at the death of a cocaine snorting, prostitute client  midget. Never would you expect to find a black comedy about murder and Belgium more emotional than The Green Mile and Marley and Me put together. It totally took me by surprise.\rIn Bruges is definitely one of my favorite movies of the last decade and extremely entertaining, I strongly recommend it as long as you are prepared for the amazing overuse of the word ",

There was no way to take this seriously but just to enjoy the ride to the somewhat over-the-top ending which was a bit much for me but the preceding scenes were worth it. Colin Farrell played ",

The Story: Two hitmen are sent to Bruges in order to hide out... An expected call from the boss though, results in unexpected orders, for an otherwise expected outcome. It's kind of a character study in that there's a significant amount of time learning what makes these characters tick, the problem is, that (on first viewing at least) there's not much too the characters... Ray feels guilty for his past and spends most of the film trying to figure out if he deserves to live. Ken, mesmerized by the wonderland that is Bruges, finds himself worried about his friend, taking it upon himself to save his partners soul. Conflicted by the moral issues that surround his current situation and job... And than there's Harry. The boss. He's a villain that you know deep down inside you can't hate because he makes a valid point, one must pay for their own actions, accidental or not. He's not evil, though he's not nice either, he's not good but he's not bad, and you're not going to be rooting for him. The Cast: Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Ralph Fiennes... Colin Farrell is Ray, guilt stricken by a hit gone terribly awry. He gives a good performance as he's eternally conflicted, he's not a man, but he feels deeply ashamed of himself for his past actions, so doesn't that mean that he should be forgiven? Or is he hopeless because he's done the unthinkable? Solid performance from start to finish. Brendan Gleeson is Ken, stuck between a rock and a hard place hit his partner or save his soul, giving him a second chance? Arguably the best performance in the film. Ralph Fiennes is Harry, a firm believer that some actions deserve certain consequences no matter what the circumstance. You know he has a heart and you know that on some level he is in fact right, but you're wishing he's wrong the entire time. Great performance, but not his best. Probably the first time that a trailer has truly influenced my score... There's no disagreeing that the trailer is about as misleading as you can possibly get. The trailer has you believing that Guy Ritchie has some competition. It's fast, it's clever, it's stylish, it's funny, and it's full of quirky or offbeat characters... The film itself is slowpaced, sometimes predictable and nowhere near as complex as you're expecting, as the quirky characters often add little to nothing to the story... I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt, I only watched it once expecting a fast paced Snatch type film, really hoping to see another Guy Ritchie on the horizon... The second time around I'm sure it will be immensely better.",

The film portrays two hit men hiding out in the historical Belgian city of Bruges after carrying out a gruesomely sloppy hit back home in England. It's hard to believe that a flick about such an event could possibly turn out to be charming (as well as a number of other things), but McDonagh and an excellent cast pull it off. The result is black comedy as its absolute best. My only problem was some difficulty with the thick British accents (Cockney?) that denied me even further laughs and enjoyment of the extraordinary dialogue.

Congenial or not, Ken(Brendan Gleeson) is a sociopath. The company he keeps are other hitmen, like Ray(Colin Farrell), Ken's charge, who just recently shot a Catholic preist. But there was an accident. There was collateral damage. For all the un-PC humor in \"In Bruges\", perhaps the funniest thing about this lively film is the tacit agreement between filmmaker and audience that the dead clergyman be forgotten. We're judging Ray solely on how he reacts to the second body. \"In Bruges\" cons the audience into feeling sorry for a man who had recently shot a man of God in cold blood. If there is such a thing as honor among hitmen, Ray is no hitman(as Ken pointed out), because he has no honor, which precludes his occupation and the occupational hazards that go with it. Ken was wrong about Ray. He withholds a key tidbit of information from Harry(Ralph Fiennes) at the end of \"In Bruges\" which would've brought honor to his mentor(Ken). Like samurai, Harry lives and dies by the code. Earlier, when Ray points the gun to his own head, he was probably only bluffing.",

Colin Farrell'In Bruges' is a deliberately paced, slow-burning, and at times, uninteresting comedy. Filled with characters that I did not seem to care for, and a plot that made the film feel at least two times longer than it should have. Colin Farrell plays an Irish hitman named Ray, whose order was to originally kill a priest, but he accidentally killed a young boy while during his task.  He, and his mentor, Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are sent to Bruges to wait for their next task and instructions. Ken seems to love the city and plans to go sightseeing, but Ray feels indifferent, and at times, is very cynical about the whole thing. Their employer, Harry (Ralph Fiennes) is furious and wants Ken to kill Ray, after coming to the conclusion that Ray killing a child is unforgivable. The movie, directed by Martin McDonagh, has its fair share of some well-thought out scenes, and is crafted the best that it can. However, I found myself to be uninterested in any of the characters and/or events that occur throughout this film. It got very little laughs from me. Colin Farrell is excellent as the sometimes nervous character, Ray, and he shares some excellent screen-time with his co-star, Brendan Gleeson, but ultimately, these great performances weren't enough to keep me invested. It's a mechanical and manufactured comedy, filled with some uplift, but the run-time drags and things escalate towards the third act, but it was too late for me, as whatever interest I had in the movie, was already gone. An admirable effort, but it could have been better.",
