    "critic_reviews": [
        "A second-rate regurgitation of \"The Lord of the Rings.\" Everything about it, down to the set and costume design, apes Peter Jackson's epic trilogy. However, while \"The Lord of the Rings\" was a grand story of scope and power, In the Name of the King feels small in more ways than one.",
        "Its convictionless competence is merely dull, denying the pleasures of an outright howler without providing much else.",
        "Is this movie so god-awful bad that it's hilariously good? Can't be bothered deciding. Figure that's an answer in itself.",
        "This is the sort of movie where men stand blankly over dead loved ones, then start digging. Masculine stoicism or emotional botox? You decide.",
        "Cultists will be happy to discover that In The Name Of The King bears all the so-bad-it's-good hallmarks of a classic Boll production.",
        "Director Uwe Boll sticks with what he knows -- how to turn video games into dull, cheap-looking movies.",
        "An awkward \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d knockoff, it features both elaborate battles and bumbling humor, though it\u2019s never quite clear when you should be laughing.",
        "As numbing and depressing to watch as suits hammering out a film-packaging deal one venal clause at a time.",
        "Who among us can explain the enigma wrapped in a riddle surrounded by fierce, ravening, razor-toothed conundrums that is German director Uwe Boll?",
        "It's completely undone by its terrible screenplay, inept direction, oppressive musical score and muddy visual palette.",
        "A plodding patchwork of derivative fantasy-adventure, medieval production design, risible dialogue, unimpressive CGI trickery and haphazardly edited action sequences."

It suffers the same problems than most of Bolls movies. Most into the eye popping was the much too close up clumsy camerawork that made even the best action sequences of the movie look like some crappy TV-series. The Sets and the costumes are almost great. ok, the plot stinks and is predictable to the bone, but that was clear form the beginning. Over all i would call it Bolls best work till now ( waiting for Far cry... xD )... You can even call it a real movie ^^ He would have done himself a favour not to go with the Dungon siege licence though... The movie would have been picked up a lot better if it had stayed of the videogame stuff and just been another fanasy-movie... Whatever",
