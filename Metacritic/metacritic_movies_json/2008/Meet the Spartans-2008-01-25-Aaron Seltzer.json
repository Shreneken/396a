  "title": "Meet the Spartans",
  "rating": 2.8,
  "release_date": "2008-01-25",
  "summary": "The heroic Leonidas, armed with nothing by leather underwear and a cape, leads a ragtag group of 13 - count 'em, 13! -- Spartans to defend their homeland against the invading Persians (whose ranks include Ghost Rider, Rocky Balboa, the Transformers, and a hunchbacked Paris Hilton). (20th Century Fox)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Less classic Mel Brooks than middling \"Best Week Ever.\"",
    "The best thing in Meet the Spartans is the swift kick in the bombast it delivers to the oh-no-not-us homoeroticism of \"300.\"",
    "The musical number that runs during the closing credits funnier than anything that precedes it, which isn't saying much.",
    "Writer-directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer basically reprise the tired formula from their earlier efforts, which is to throw in as many pop culture references as possible to cover up the lack of any real wit.",
    "Overkill is what Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer do best: as the uncontested titans of the parody genre (with fingers in everything from the “Scary Movie” franchise to the more recent “Epic Movie”) they continue to prove that ridiculing other movies is much easier than making your own.",
    "Meet the Spartans is a mild improvement over their \"Epic Movie,\" which is like saying that a debilitating fever is more fun than appendicitis, but what’s shocking is how lazy it is, which is a shame for former UK child star/pop singer Sean Maguire, whose Gerard Butler impersonation is spot-on.",
    "Lazy, lame and painfully unfunny, Meet the Spartans is yet another scrambled-genre parody.",
    "Meet The Spartans gamely alternates between unfunny gay jokes and violent pratfalls for a good 80 minutes, finding time for not one, but two musical dance numbers set to \"I Will Survive.\"",
    "Witless, tasteless, formless spoof.",
    "Hey, guys, when you repurpose a disco hit to poke fun at gay men, not only do you look like assholes, you look like assholes who rip their jokes off of YouTube.",
    "It’s rare that a movie makes me ill these days, and it’s rare that I can see a movie and hate the people behind it with such abhorrence, but Meet the Spartans rises to the challenge."

It's no wonder I liked this movie, really, as I've seen every Family Guy As much as I understand why people love artsy movies like Schindler's List, which is in fact a good movie, what I do enjoy the most is a good comedy. It's no wonder I liked this movie, really, as I've seen every Family Guy episode to date, and Scary Movie 1-4, and I loved them all. It seems some people are under the impression that pop-culture references are not jokes. But the point of a joke is to make you laugh, and that's also the point of pop-culture references. With that out of the way, on to the actual review. Meet the Spartans is a sea of pop-culture references, that doesn't border on being overkill, it throws itself headlong into overkill. To truly enjoy this movie, you may need a strong knowledge of American culture, so if you live in the USA, you are all set. But if you live in Europe, you would benefit from studying up on general USA life. I am a European myself, and I can say this, watching Family Guy and South Park really helps. If you enjoy these series, or Scary Movie, you are much more likely to enjoy this movie. It's overflowing with hilarious pop-culture references and, while short on original jokes, it works fine anyway. So, go see it, unless you're hooked on The Godfather. And to all the people who think the ones who like this movie are idiots, I am 14 years old, and English is not my native language. Yet, here I am, writing this elaborate review, proving that you don't need to be stupid to see this movie. In fact, it's the complete opposite. You need to be intelligent to enjoy this movie. Perhaps you will see the movie, perhaps not. If not, you are definately missing out on something great. And with that, I leave you all to your thoughts.",

We knew this before the movie came out, we knew this during its theatrical run and, six years after its release, we still know this. As a comedy, this film fails on all counts, because it's brutally unfunny. This film represents the very worst of American comedy. This is comedy that's gone through liposuction, and is suffering the immediate after-effect. It's painfully boring, painfully unfunny and painfully painful.\r And what makes this even worse is the fact that Seltzer and Friedberg could actually be... talented. Bear with me for a moment, let me explain. Look at this film. While the humour and the parody (i.e. the reason we're watching the movie) fail, this film is competently made. The camerawork's quite good, as is the lighting, and I think, if it wasn't a comedy movie, the writing could be acceptable. If Seltzer and Friedberg were to sit down and try to write a decent story with decent dialogue that relied in no way on humour or wit, it would be decent.\r It wouldn't be astounding, but it'd be decent. If they pushed the actors far enough, they could deliver good performances, I'm sure of that. I seriously doubt that all of the guys in this film are actually bad actors. Greg Sestero isn't a bad actor, as much as The Room will make you think otherwise. And I think a lot of the cast of this film could give decent performances. Not great, mind you, but decent. I think, if this movie were different, not a parody film but an actual movie, it would be decent. Certainly not great, probably not good, and maybe not even average, but it wouldn't be as absolutely god awful as this was. This film is a failure on almost all counts, and shouldn't exist.",

I think that Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer realized their movies suck so bad, since they can not climb the \"I'm original or funny\" ladder, they must go in the opposite direction as fast as possible. Yes it was like YouTube clips put together by a 9th grade Audio/Video Club. But look at the sheer brilliance of how they picked the most boring material that can be gathered at the time. Happy Feet with a black gansta attitude? American Idol and Dancing with the Stars reviewers? I mean truly think they said to themselves \"what can we add now? Quick turn on the TV. Hey American Idol - put that in there. Hey Miami:CSI put that..no wait dont put that in there, it's funny. Ok look at youtube for an idea. Wait how about a transformer with a youtube video on it? Hurry up, this script needs to be done by tomorrow morning\". So I give it a 10 for being the ultimate unfunny, boring rehash of unfunny, boring pop culture references that will definitely leave anyone between 11-70 wondering \"didnt the actors who read the script realized this is lame?\"",

The pop-culture references are well overdone, almost all the jokes drag on and all of them are unfunny. The fact that this has received reviews of 10 by people who honestly believe this is how a good parody movie is made, just shows me how MTV has dumb down this generation.",

I thought the Scary Movies were good for a laugh, but it is really obvious now that Friedberg and Setzer are utterly devoid of talent and were simply relying on the Wayans Brothers to cover for them.",

But wait, Aaron Seltzer is a pseudonym, so the film gets a zero. But, in all seriousness, I'm half convinced I was going to give this film a 1 out of sheer awe of the filmmaker who is willing to attach his name to this pile of garbage. But wait, Aaron Seltzer is a pseudonym, so the film gets a zero. But, in all seriousness, I'm half convinced that the writers/directors are out to intentionally insult the intelligence of their audience. Rather than being an engaging pastiche of homage, allusion, and playful parody, the film is a repulsive Kindergarten's collage of non-sequitor, lowbrow humor that panders to an audience group even lower than the fanboys. The movie caters to those who would rather laugh for one second than think for even three, as evidenced by the frantic pacing of the mostly slapstick jokes. I doubt that the filmmakers could execute a simple pratfall without having whatever character trip through three or four unfunny pop culture allusions on his way down. The simple solution to this spreading problem of low moviemaking standards is not to see this film. The studios clearly don't care about how well-reviewed their movies are, so the only way to stop them from putting out another awful spoof movie is to avoid seeing the ones that they are producing right now. It will be by the grace of God if this movie makes less than 2 or 3 million, because awful profit margins are the only way to cut off Friedberg and Seltzer's funding.",
