But before he could try and snuggle up to her at nap time, or maybe send her a valentine, his family moved away.  In the intervening years there have been other women in Nate's life, but none who could measure up to Cristabel.  Convinced she's the only girl for him, Nate decides to move back to L.A. and track her down.  The good news: she's still single and stunning.  The bad news: there's a reason she's still single.  Cristabel's still best friends with the same ugly little girl Nate remembers from first grade, June Phigg. The two are inseparable.  They live together.  They go to yoga together.  They would even go on double dates together...if only June could get a date.  And Cristabel simply refuses to leave dear June home alone. Determined to spend as much time as possible with Cristabel, Nate sets out to find a boyfriend for June.  But even when he pays them, guys all flee at the sight of her.  And then it hits him: June needs a makeover.  But as Nate and June become friends and she emerges from her cocoon, Nate slowly realizes that the girl of his dreams isn't the hottie at all.  It's the nottie -- who turns out to be something of a hottie herself. (Regent Releasing)â€¦ Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The Farrelly brothers could burp out a movie funnier than The Hottie & the Nottie, a farce of corrupt stereotypes that's never more grotesque than when it pretends to be more than skin-deep.",
    "Like Nate, we are mere Notties. And we are supposed to feel oh-so privileged for getting to watch Paris through the glass.",
    "Ultimately best suited for the confines of late-night cable.",
    "Though Hilton may be a model, if her work in Hottie is any indication, she is no actress.",
    "Great actors make the craft look easy. In the Paris Hilton comedy The Hottie and the Nottie, acting looks very, very difficult.",
    "You've got to admire Hilton's complete conviction in herself as the center of all that is beautiful and good. And maybe such unwavering self-regard is actually kind of hot. Or not.",
    "You've seen dozens of movies like this on cable in the wee hours.",
    "Ugly in more ways than one.",
    "Verdict: not so hot",
    "A cinematic excursion so horrific that it's an insult to bad movies to call it a bad movie.",
    "That generous half star rating I tacked onto  this comedy abomination is all for Paris Hilton. Come on, it takes guts (or gross dim-wittedness) to appear on screen again after \"House of Wax.\"",
    "Crass, shrill, disingenuous, tawdry, mean-spirited, vulgar, idiotic, boring, slapdash, half-assed, and very, very unfunny.",
    "Paris Hilton has already ushered a remarkable three features into the Internet Movie Database's \"Bottom 100.\" The Hottie and the Nottie will make it an even four.",
    "How is Paris Hilton in her first starring role to receive a national release? Pretty bad, actually. She's limited to a single, all-too-familiar expression of smug self-satisfaction, and she delivers her lines in a tone somewhere between \"seductive\" and \"dish-soap commercial.\"",
    "Preposterous, disingenuous, remarkably unfunny and genuinely distasteful.",
    "Custom designed for its smirking star (who is also an executive producer), this tasteless train wreck asks only that she preen and prance on cue.",
    "It's not like Paris Hilton to rise above her material, but The Hottie and the Nottie sinks so low that all she has to do is stand upright.",
    "The most astounding thing about this abysmal comedy -- aside from the fact the studio actually allowed critics within a mile of it -- is that it's so ghastly it is beneath even the meager dignity of Paris Hilton."

It is undoubtedly almost, if not literally, vomit-inducing. But then, it is also true that she is a star because the American culture is obsessed with celebrity and celebrity-worshipping, and the tendancy is also, unfortunately, to equate celebrity with talent.... (look at the popularity of reality tv covering metaphorical train-wrecks with unabashed glee) ...thus her being in this film and its existence is, in fact, YOUR fault. You all said, \"we like stupid. We'll pay for stupid. It represents us, our hopes, our aspirations, our level of self-respect.\" You quite clearly have a 'high-fibre' entertainment diet that sees you rarely test yourself or aspire to create 'art' in any authentic sense consistently. Bums on seats is the only ethos. Especially to blame is the gullibility of young girls, their parents and equally of course the media that happily dupe them all for cash. Cos at the end of the day that's all this is about.... that's why I imagine she is probably a producer on the film itself or something similar. That's all it is ever about - and the quality reflects this. The people who actually saw it and complain about it - YOU are to blame. You are financing the sequel: The Whore and the Snore with your own money. A large gathering of retarded primates is furiously at work on the type-writers as we speak, assembling this masterpiece in earnest. But the funniest aspect is the criticism itself.... so born out of the dumbed-down culture that Paris and her ilk have inspired..... that, well, none of you can use the english language properly either. Every remark is quick to shoot from the hip but equally to use words that are completely out of context. It's too late to lauch an attack on Paris - she already won. With every word against her I can't help but think that you're all right.... she is a complete dick. And you're the dicks who have the same problems with your own language (the tool by which we articulate our very being to others and therefore the most powerful tool we have at our disposal), the same poor taste, but less money. I guess that makes the hating amount to jealousy. Cos she's the same....... but better. Tragic really.",
