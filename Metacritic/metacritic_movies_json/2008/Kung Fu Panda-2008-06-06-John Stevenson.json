Unexpectedly chosen to fulfill an ancient prophecy, Po’s dreams become reality when he joins the world of Kung Fu and studies alongside his idols—the legendary fighters Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey—under the leadership of their guru, Master Shifu.  But before they know it, the vengeful and treacherous snow leopard Tai Lung is headed their way, and it’s up to Po to defend everyone from the oncoming threat. Can he turn his dreams of becoming a Kung Fu master into reality? Po puts his heart-and his girth-into the task, and the unlikely hero ultimately finds that his greatest weaknesses turn out to be his greatest strengths. [Dreamworks]… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Light and goofy, yet the fight scenes, which are the heart of the film, are lickety-split mad fun.",
    "Yet another celebrity-voiced animal adventure, but it stands out from the crowd of similar films with its lightning wit and whirlwind brio.",
    "The stroke of genius is, of course, the film's hero -- the big, lovable bear that is the Chinese panda.",
    "Infectious and inspiring, despite one's best efforts to resist its charms.",
    "At once fuzzy-wuzzy and industrial strength, the tacky-sounding Kung Fu Panda is high concept with a heart.",
    "The new picture provides a master coursed in cunning visual art and ultra-satisfying entertainment.",
    "Everything about Kung Fu Panda is a little better, a little sharper, a little funnier than the animated run of the mill.",
    "The voice cast includes Angelina Jolie as a tigress, omnipresent Seth Rogen as an acupuncturist who's a praying mantis, David Cross as a nasal crane and Lucy Liu as a cheerful viper.",
    "The stunning set pieces take full advantage of animation’s unique mastery over time and space, so that we don’t just watch the characters’ daredevil exploits – we’re spinning and whirling right along with them. It’s as if we’ve mastered space and time ourselves.",
    "It's not an instant classic, but it's imaginatively drawn, full of charming characters, alive with action sequences and blissfully free of the snickering scatology and endless pop-culture references.",
    "The animation is consistently sporty and there are some choice comic riffs on martial arts movies.",
    "Rudimentary plot and merely decent gags aside, this is the finest DreamWorks Animation effort since the first Shrek, chiefly because of its astonishing visuals and kinetic kung fu sequences.",
    "The animation is first-rate, and the settings and background are appropriately exotic. The fights are a lot more exciting than you would think.  And if the story is somewhat predictable (and the final blow somewhat difficult to fathom), one could find lesser heroes to root for than Po, although none more unlikely.",
    "If you're a martial arts/action movie fan in particular, much of the action in the film will leave you very satisfied. There's a prison escape sequence that is jaw-droppingly cool.",
    "This is a solid family film material, although one suspects the children will get a little more out of it than their parents.",
    "Not one of the great recent animated films. The story is way too predictable, and truth to tell, Po himself didn't overwhelm me with his charisma. But it's elegantly drawn, the action sequences are packed with energy, and it's short enough that older viewers will be forgiving.",
    "Thanks to a witty script and the recognizably goofy but absolutely earnest delivery of Black, Kung Fu Panda has a human soul, too.",
    "It was definitely a great idea to give Kung Fu Panda the IMAX treatment. The fight scenes, quivering whiskers and moist noses, foggy mountaintops, and fluttering peach blossoms are equally impressive on the huge, curved screen.",
    "Beautifully animated, the celebrity voice performances are terrific, and the action sequences negotiate the fine line between being physically convincing and becoming too intense for the young children.",
    "I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that this is probably the best movie so far this year about a kung-fu fighting panda.",
    "This movie leaves 'em laughing - and gasping.",
    "It's the overriding spirit of the movie that forms its greatest appeal: Here's a movie that isn't intent on conquering the world but simply entertaining you for a breezy 90 minutes.",
    "Po speaks loudly and carries big shtick. Let the rest of the world cringe at our hyperconfidence, our charisma, our pure awesomeness.",
    "The result is a genuinely pleasing kung fu movie that kids and grown-ups can enjoy.",
    "Perfectly pleasant, very good-looking, modestly funny, dispiritingly unoriginal variant on the nerd-with-a-dream recipe that's been clobbered to death in animated films for at least a decade now.",
    "The action, heavily influenced by Hong Kong martial arts films, is beautifully choreographed.",
    "The essence of the film is slapsticky, chopsocky action, rendered with great verve and accompanied by bromides having to do with the need to believe.",
    "Tongue-in-cheek dialogue, inventive slapstick and fight sequences, and luminous production design make this a treat.",
    "Po (Black) may be an animated panda bear, but make no mistake: Deep down he's really just a nerd with a pop-culture obsession.",
    "The film lacks the comic ingenuity of the best in CGI critter movies. It's not fun-for-the-whole-family, like \"Shrek.\" Still, it's a howl and amazement for anyone under 12.",
    "Kung Fu Panda goes nowhere surprising even as its images unscroll handsomely before our eyes. The sound could go out in the theater, and you wouldn't ask for your money back.",
    "Though the film's simple story is squarely aimed at tots, DreamWorks' digitizers have referenced Eastern visual styles -- everything from delicate Chinese screens to flashy Japanese anime -- to enliven the look of the film.",
    "This is an unashamedly old-fashioned children's movie, and a predictable message is part of the mission. But that's okay; what the movie lacks in surprises, it makes up for in whimsical fun.",
    "A nice looking but heavily formulaic DreamWorks animation entry.",
    "Though occasionally visually inventive, Kung Fu Panda is a disappointment when it comes to matters of simple black and white: the script.",
    "It's impressive enough to look at, and the voice talent – especially Black and Hoffman - doesn't disappoint, but all the CGI wankery and high-end talent only barely allows Kung Fu Panda to rise above cliché."

It was short and had a very simply laid out beginning, middle, and end. Certain parts were dragged out a bit more than necessary and others were over quicker than they should have been, like the solution to the mystery of the Dragon Scroll. It was just completely unprompted and almost awkwardly shoved into a scene in the movie where it didn't really fit. Jack Black (beside the animation itself)is really the only phenomenal part of film. His personality really adds to the character and makes him likable, relatable, and ultimately enjoyable. I'd recommend it for viewers with younger children. Other than that, I'd rent when it comes out on video.",

It had some very emotional moments with gave this movie a heart to the original story.The cinematography was magnificent when it comes to make a wonderful cast to play their rightful voices for the characters. Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman made an awesome mix of Po and Master Shifu because of their own personalities, different expositions, and their only chances of becoming friends to one another near the end of the movie. Ian Mcshane's performance as Tai Lung was amazing and his frightening presence gave me the shivers. James Hong as Po's father (who obviously played Chi Fu in Disney's Mulan) was very entertaining. The cast of the Furious Five were very good and they were given a little bit of screen time and were developed near the end of the movie which makes Angelina Jolie, David Cross, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, and Jackie Chan very memorable in this animated feature film.The CGI animation is very amazing and somehow beautiful in most animated feature films, The characters were very likable and memorable that even ex-Disney animators would find them entertaining, the comedy was hilarious with Po's moments and the sets stayed very true to the Chinese culture. The action scenes were very intense and very unique which makes this movie the first CGI cartoon to have action sequences.The music score by Hans Zimmer (The Lion King, The Road to El Dorado) and John Powell (in other Dreamworks Animation features) was very memorable and a lot of emotion to it to describe the characters feelings and the academy awards proved it.The only problem that I do have with this movie was the clunky plot/script and not only that. It was too predictable.Kung Fu Panda may not be a masterpiece, but it's a surprisingly good animated kung fu flick. It made $631 million dollars at the box office and it was as epic as Disney's The Lion King.9/10",

In a film with Jackie Chan, the closest thing we have to the late Lee, it's interesting to mention that the Anglo-American actor gets to read the ancient prophecy, and not somebody of actual Asian descent.",

The special effects were amazing, with the fire looking very lively while the dirt and dust merged perfectly with the environment it was put in, Dreamworks outdid themselves, and perhaps Pixar on this one, at least until Wall-E comes out next week.",

Kung Fu Panda is the best Dreamworks film, one made on their own, since Shrek 2. This film trades in excessive pop culture humor, which was getting a tad annoying in such films as Bee Movie and replaces it with heart, a good message (along with a clever way of explaining it), and occasional slapstic. Also, the film has likeable characters and excellent animation. It is very clear that the filmmakers really cared about turning around a great product and they did. This film is definitely worth checking out. Kids will love it immediately and older kids and adults will enjoy it as well for the reasons I just stated above. This film may seem like a generic Dreamworks film but it is miles ahead of most of their stuff by actually being entertaining. For so long Dreamworks has failed to turn out something highly entertaining relying heavily on gimics and Aardman, who they chose to let go, to keep their movies afloat. This movie is a breaf of fresh air and a major turnaround for a company that had lost some steam critically following the Shrek movies. Again this film is definitely worth checking out. To Dreamworks all I have to say is this keep it up I look forward to seeing more good products from you especially the team involved on this film.

Jack Black, along with the rest of the voice cast, does an incredible job of making us believe that these animals are actually part of a kung fu team. I loved this movie from beginning to end. The witty humor, the hidden adult humor, the fight sequences, the visuals, and the storytelling, are all small parts that come together to make this movie one to remember. Dreamworks has definitely hit it's mark in super-stardom. Common sense has just been kicked into me and I am ready for so much more. This movie is just not enough. Kung Fu Panda is incredible!!!",

Apart from Po and Shifu(and possibly the film's villain, splendidly voiced by Ian McShane) the film is lacking in its character development, while the story while well constructed, original and fresh has its predictable parts and the message is a little over-familiar. However, when it comes to the visuals, there is nothing to fault, the whole film with its gorgeous colours and backgrounds looks wonderful. The score is excellent as well, and I can see that there was care to make it sound authentic. The script is witty, funny and smart, the pace is bright and breezy and the voice acting is solid across the board- Dustin Hoffmann is perfectly cast while Jack Black does a great job voicing one of his more likable characters. In conclusion, very entertaining film, but it didn't wow me completely. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

Jack Black stars as the lovable Po, a big fat bumbling goof of a panda. His passion for Kung Fu caused him to \"accidentally\" stumble into the role of the Dragon Warrior, and now it was up to him to fulfill the duties that come with it.The animation is spectacular. The character designs are unique and their movements are quite fluid. The settings and landscapes are vibrant and reflect perfectly where the movie takes place. The action scenes are exciting and creative as the characters use the environment and the object in it to their advantage.The humor is top-notch as everyone fits their roles perfectly. Jack Black delivers his lines in the most Jack Black-ish way he possibly can, really making Po come to life on screen. The way this movie spoofs various martial arts movie tropes while also taking itself seriously is outrageously funny. You definitely won't be leaving without busting a gut at least once.Everything in this movie was done amazingly, and it was a fantastic start to one of DreamWorks' most beloved series.",

The other reviewers, I dont believe are grateful to the amount detail the people at DreamWorks have put into this film. Looking back on this in 2017, this film is Truly beautiful and faithfull to Chinese Culture, Architecture and Music. I find this story to be very heartwarming and executed in a really, really funny way. The Panda of course, is a huggable, funny, character who I feel I somehow connect with. The other characters are extremely interesting and always convey a sense of mystery which really made me want to know more about this universe. The music is stunning which isn't suprising considering it was created by Hans Zimmer and John Powel. The main theme, known as 'Oogway Ascends' is absolutly beautiful and is in my opinion one of the greatest. The Story is fun and exhilarating with a deep meaning. And Overall find this Brilliant film one of my all time favourites.This Film, in my opinion, is one of DreamWorks most spectacular creations and I feel this film is underrated. And should rightfully acheive more attention.After watching this film, mark my words, you will be thinking of it for at least 3 days. It is one of my favourites.",
