Though the messages can be deleted, their number is up. Beth Raymond is traumatized when she witnesses the gruesome deaths of two friends just days apart. Even more disturbing, she knows that both of them had received chilling cell phone messages--actual recordings of their own horrifying last moments. Impossibly, the calls were received days before they died, but each death occurred precisely when and how the messages foretold. The police think Beth is delusional--except for Detective Jack Andrews whose own sister was killed in a freak accident that bears a strange similarity to the deaths of Beth's friends. Together, Jack and Beth work feverishly to unravel the mystery behind the ominous calls. But even as they get closer to the truth, Beth's cell phone begins to ring with an eerie tune and her phone reads \"One Missed Call...\"(Warner Bros.)… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The result is yet another tired, ultimately incoherent horror movie that undoes the promise of its pretty good premise and potentially interesting story structure with dull scares, sloppy ending and a pair of unconvincing, leaden lead performances.",
    "On the shortlist for least essential movie of the decade, a copy of a copy of a copy that's so worn down, it's about as fresh and vital as a fifth-generation dub of \"The Star Wars Holiday Special.\"",
    "This decent if derivative scare machine should benefit from a lack of genre competition.",
    "Uninspired and painfully familiar.",
    "While director Eric Valette provides the occasional chill, the disturbing spooks aren't enough to make this boat float. Burns sleepwalks through One Missed Call totally devoid of charisma, and Sossamon muddles along, going through the motions.",
    "Give this call a miss.",
    "A poker-faced puzzle whose biggest shock is the absence of Sarah Michelle Gellar.",
    "The direction is uninspired, acting is lifeless, and the script borders on the inept.",
    "If your cell phone vibrates while you’re watching One Missed Call, go ahead and answer, because even a wrong number will be more exciting than what’s happening onscreen.",
    "This garbled American remake of Takashi Miike's already staticky 2004 exercise in J-horror is a wrong number.",
    "With his preferences for static, colorless visuals and exposition-laden dialogue over conversation, director Valette has now set the bar for the worst film of 2008.",
    "One Missed Call was originally a so-so Takashi Miike freak-out. Now it's a worse-worse American eyesore.",
    "Do yourself a favor and go rent any Miike film other than this one.",
    "The original movie One Missed Call is based on was pretty tame, at least by Miike standards. And since it appears studios have no intention of halting this flood of abysmal rehashes, allow me to suggest that they at least have the stones not to pussyfoot around and give us a remake worthy of Hollywood, of America, and of an audience that lacks the willpower to stop buying tickets to half-assed crap."

This is without a doubt the worst horror movie I've ever seen, and one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There are countless plot holes and inconsistencies, and it borrows heavily from The Ring; the protagonist has a certain amount of time to solve the mystery behind an urban legend before she is killed. The explanations for what was going on in the movie were so lame. Some stuff wasn't explained at all. There is also an extremely high amount of jump scares, all of which make you roll your eyes. One was so bad that the loud noise didn't match up with the \"scary image\". You'd think there'd at least be a little bit of tension to compensate for the lame jump scares, but there's a shortage on that too. You don't care about any of the characters because they're introduced, then killed of in about 5 minutes. You definitely want to miss this call.",

There is absolutely nothing to like about this. It replaces all of the suspense from the original film with lousy jump scares and a completely nonsensical plot. And the ring tone they use in the film isn't even scary. Not in the slightest. If you heard the ring tone in the original film, chills would definitely crawl up your spine. But not in this film. When you hear the ring tone in this film, you know that something DUMB is about to happen.This movie completely missed the point of the original. The dude who directed it didn't even see the original before making this. I wish I could rate this movie lower but since I can't, I'll just have to settle for a 0. Movie directors who are planning to make a remake of a fantastic horror movie should take some notes from this film on how NOT to do that. Or just simply don't make the remake in general. Out of all American remakes of great Japanese horror movies, I think the only one that was any good was The Ring. The rest, such as this one... complete trash. Skip this and just watch the original.
