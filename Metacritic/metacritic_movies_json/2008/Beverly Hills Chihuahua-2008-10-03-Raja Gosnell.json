  "critic_reviews": [
    "Graced with unusually expressive and seamless voice work by Drew Barrymore and George Lopez, the best of its kind since \"Babe.\"",
    "Depending on your tolerance for talking Chihuahuas, this could make for a fun family night out.",
    "The picture might not be as fresh and clever as it could have been, but its spirited voice cast delivers the whole enchilada.",
    "This being Disney, wholesome character-building messages abound, but for once they're freshly spun as cautions against stereotyping both ethnic and canine.",
    "Okay, the concept for the movie is admittedly lame, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with watching a passel of adorable pooches wrinkle their brows and bark while human voices come out of their mouths.",
    "Alpo is served with a burrito chaser in Beverly Hills Chihuahua, Disney's fish-out-of-water comedy in which the fish is … well, read the title.",
    "A filthy-rich fantasy for these cash-strapped times, Beverly Hills Chihuahua features the voices of Drew Barrymore and much of the industry's top Latino talent in a live-action talking-dog lark that should please young pups.",
    "It's very slick and small children will enjoy it, but it has little of its model's special magic.",
    "As multimillion-dollar frivolities about the pets of the ruling class go, Chihuahua is reasonably diverting. As one that happens to be opening in the middle of an economic meltdown, its mere existence feels utterly insane.",
    "Barrymore's charm helps make Beverly Hills Chihuahua a congenial family outing.",
    "Performances are rather beside the point in a movie where dogs carry the acting burden, but Perabo is especially bland.",
    "This is not a movie for anyone who's aged past the \"Oh! Cute!\" phase of moviegoing. It's paced for little minds with short attention spans.",
    "Coasting on lazy stereotypes, the script basically ends where it started, teaching young viewers that it's really not so bad to be a spoiled bitchy puppy.",
    "This time the dog wags the tale and proves, at least to Papi, that love really is a bitch.",
    "The film is Beverly Hills Chihuahua. The audience is the fire hydrant.",
    "It's hard to go wrong with a movie full of talking dogs. But the makers of Beverly Hills Chihuahua sure try.",
    "Despite its superficial lip-service to self-actualization/realization, there has to be more to life than what Beverly Hills Chihuahua is putting out there, which is fit for neither man nor beast.",
    "Isn't nearly as offensive to the senses as I originally thought it would be when first presented with the trailer.",
    "Isn't terrible. OK, it's kind of terrible, but it's a talking-dog movie, and anyone who goes to a talking-dog movie without being prepared to step in poop deserves to ruin his shoes.",
    "While George Lopez, Cheech Marin, and Paul Rodriguez are funny men, it's amazing how boring these Latin-shtick cutups can be when none of them gets a single good line.",
    "Even a film as shabby and humdrum as Beverly Hills Chihuahua, which never musters up the wit and beauty of a single frame of \"Lady and the Tramp,\" is not without its pleasures.",
    "Forget the metaphors, why not just make a movie about poor, exploited Mexicans?"

      "content": "Had this children's movie the ambition to take its theme of class-consciousness with just a modicum of gravity and levity, \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\" might have challenged Chris Noonan's \"Babe\" for best of breed: the talking animal Had this children's movie the ambition to take its theme of class-consciousness with just a modicum of gravity and levity, \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\" might have challenged Chris Noonan's \"Babe\" for best of breed: the talking animal movie division. If the high society lady's fully-grown children in Douglas Sirk's \"All That Heaven Allows\" bought their lonely mother a chihuahua instead of a television, the lapdog and the gardener's hunting dog might have suggested to Cary Scott(Jane Wyman) that she belongs with Ron Kirby(Rock Hudson). \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\" stands on the periphery of the 1956 melodrama that inspired Todd Haynes' \"Far From Heaven\", as Papi(George Lopez) the landscaper's dog, falls for Chloe(Drew Barrymore) the high-maintenance chihuahua, but the film is too timid to take that extra step. Chloe's poolside friends drool over the hunky utilitarian canine because he's the forbidden fruit(the dog you don't take home to meet your master), but what would these pampered pooches say if the queen bee-otch(remember: a female dog is a bitch) declared her love for Papi. Ostracization from dog society? Even more daunting: Imagine Chloe's dilemma if she had to choose between Papi and her owner Viv(Jamie Lee Curtis). One suspects that madame wouldn't want Chloe to birth puppies with an unregistered dog. Although \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\" is mostly informed by girly films such as \"Clueless\" and \"Totally Legal\", it does manage to smuggle in a reference to Rainier Werner Fassbinder's \"Ali: Fear Eats the Soul\"(German title: \"Angst essen Seele auf\") when Viv explains to Rachel(Piper Perabo) that Chloe doesn't like Berlin. In the German reimagining of the Douglas Sirk sudser, it's not just class warfare, but also a divergence in race(she's German; he's Moroccoan), that keeps the lovers apart. Chloe, quite pointedly, is identified as a \"gringo\" by one of the stray dogs down Mexico way, while Papi unmistakably sounds Hispanic in nature. Predictably, being around mutts, a rat, and inexplicably, an iguana, Chloe learns how the other half lives, and loses her elitist mentality. But how does one explain Viv's transformation? While Delgado(a German shephard voiced by Andy Garcia) regains his sense of smell which allows him to rejoin the police dog force, Viv's nose suggests a more tolerant worldview when she smiles and voices her approval about Chloe's new \"earthy\" smell. Unless Viv is some sort of dog medium, and relives Chloe's adventures in Tijuana, the privileged woman's newfound well-roundedness seems largely unearned; completely out of the blue. Do you know what's Pixar's secret? They make children's films that go a little too far. That's why they achieve transcendence. \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\", on the other hand, plays out like \"Far From Heaven\" with a happy ending, sans the Brechtian distanciation.",
