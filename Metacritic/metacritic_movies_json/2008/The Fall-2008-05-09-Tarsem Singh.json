    "critic_reviews": [
        "A movie that you might want to see for no other reason than because it exists. There will never be another like it.",
        "It's the most glorious, wonderful mess put onscreen since Terry Gilliam's \"Brazil.\"",
        "A deliciously vivid adventure fantasy.",
        "The Fall is a movie whose every frame pulsates with the desire to be a transportive, transcendent work of cinema. And each one of said frames is full of visual bedazzlement and wonder. So full that one is loathe to sum up with the phrase \"Close, but no cigar.\" But there is something, finally, kind of pushy about the film's desire to be a masterpiece.",
        "Dazzling and delirious, The Fall is a celebration of cinema, of old-fashioned storytelling and globe-hopping spectacle.",
        "The Fall is often an affectionate caricature itself, but one of astonishing beauty, featuring two heartfelt performances from Untaru and the tender, often mordantly funny Pace. They're perfect foils for Tarsem's gorgeous tone poem to cinema as a medium of magic and miracles, stories and lies.",
        "The Fall lives and dies on the strength of Pace and Untaru's remarkable performances. It's there that the pulsing heart of this magical-real film beats most true.",
        "Although the film revolves around a child, it's not a children's movie: A cruel and bitter undertone runs through the fanciful adventures, and Walker's depression is no mere plot contrivance to be cured by Alexandria's childish enthusiasm.",
        "The Fall is aptly named not only because it pertains to a tragic descent but because viewers will feel as if they have plunged headlong into an alternate universe with this dazzling adult fairy tale.",
        "It's an achingly beautiful movie and a triumph of location scouting, with more cosmopolitan spectacle than the past three Indiana Jones and James Bond movies combined.",
        "Director Tarsem (The Cell) reworks the 1981 Bulgarian film \"Yo Ho Ho\" for this stylish fantasy.",
        "Some of the set pieces are ravishing, more often they're ravishingly clunky.",
        "The Fall is what you'd get if you told a fiendishly gifted graphic illustrator the plot of \"The Princess Bride\" and sent him off to come up with his own version.",
        "If the human details are often problematic, the IMAX-grade bombast, ceremonial camera, and Jodorowsky-esque eclecticism still combine for a singular spectacle.",
        "There's no doubt that Tarsem's a visionary director. Now he needs to envision a worthwhile script for himself.",
        "Tarsem and his screenwriting collaborators aren't able to come up with enough interesting justifications for their sudden shifts, and soon the shape-shifting yarn just feels like lazy storytelling.",
        "This convoluted, arbitrary, overlong whimsy will strike most grown-ups as childish, and is far too violent and pretentious for kids.",
        "It's basically a Middle Eastern version of \"The Princess Bride\" with an assisted-suicide subplot.",
        "It has a rich premise and no lack of amazements. What it lacks in any sort of dramatic shape.",
        "It's the kind of movie for which the phrase ''you've never seen anything like it before'' was invented. The question is whether anyone would want to.",
        "Pretty pictures - thats what The Fall has to offer.",
        "A genuine labor of love -- and a real bore.",
        "There is never a sense that The Fall exists for any reason besides simply being something nice to look at. Yet no matter how good-looking a film may be, if it's as sleep-inducing as this, there's simply no point."

Critics giving this film low scores do not appreciate charismatic cinematography, especially when its not filled with gallons of blood, nudity and vulgar language. In modern day cinema, it was refreshing to see a film so original. This is a must-see for all movie-goers. A+",

The only reason I did not give it a 10 is that it was more like watching a world class art installation than a dramatic film. The story is simple in its construction (although there are some not so obvious underlying meanings). In general, I think the negative reviews are related to the small mindedness of the general American movie going crowd. The most amazing part of this movie is that no computers were used to enhance any scene. In an age where we take the amazing for granted because everything is altered - this movie is truly amazing!

I have never been that fond of Tarsem's work, like The Cell, which was okay but the standout was the awesome Immortals. The Fall is a beautiful looking film, it surpasses all technical aspects and creates a living breathing world inside. Lee Pace is good in the lead, but I have seen better from him. You see, The Fall is low on violence and is more about the immersion of the viewer. The story is convoluted and hollow at times, with kiddish dialogues and screenplay that is all over the place. But this is a different movie, one that has the ultimate power to entertain the viewer and at the same time dazzle them.

There are two ways to watch this movie, one is just to watch it, in which case you might as well just make a slideshow of stills and set those as your screensaver. Wait, there are three ways, because you could also take mushrooms and put it on a projector, which will be a \u201ctrip\u201d\u2014as they are fond of saying. The third way is to watch it while mentally projecting the invisible character of Tarsem Singh pacing like an angry tiger on the periphery of every scene. In case you are unfamiliar, here\u2019s the new synopsis: inexperienced director sinks fortune and years of his and others\u2019 lives into passion/vanity project that is supposed to be the ultimate ode to old school film making. See Tarsem pouring over a script for too long to keep it straight. See Tarsem yelling at his adorable actors until they start to breakdown for real. But also, see Tarsem searching the world over for the most beautiful places you have never seen, and lovingly recreating the greatest non-CG effects with such audacious aplomb that you simply can\u2019t understand how the **** he pulled off some of those shots, and see someone obsessed with dead filmmaking make a film about dying filmmaking in a confused and beautiful hurricane of love and futility. Do that and you\u2019ll be glad you got something more than a screensaver and a trip to the hospital like your other two friends.",

A feast of vivid colors and showy costumes. Incredible acting from the little girl supplemented by decent acting from Lee Pace. Unfortunately, the story is difficult to comprehend when formatted as a 100-minute feature film. By forcing you to focus on understanding what is going on, you start to miss the impact of the story being told. I get what the film is trying to do - the fractured, nonsensical plot reflects the state of the characters in weaving a combined narrative, highlighting a difference in language and mindset. Yet, one could argue that the content of the dream sequences doesn't matter all that much to the take home message, in which case the director should be a better shepherd of the viewer's time. Roy's motivation could be improved as well. We are shown the heavy impact of love lost, without context for why it was such a powerful motivator.
