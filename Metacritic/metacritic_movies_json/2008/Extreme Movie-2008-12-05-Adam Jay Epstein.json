Oh, the writers of 'Not Another Teen Movie.  In that case...\r The film is not only unfunny and badly made, but the actors are given a terrible script which ruins their performances and the film-makers mistake  humour with offending people.  To sum up the film, I'll tell you the funniest joke-  Michael Cera tries to rape an old lady.  Yeah, hilarious.\r Hit anyone who wants to watch this movie, burn every single copy and assassinate the Adam Jay Epstein and Andrew Jacobson!",
