The lonely boy's wish for a friend seems to come true when he meets Eli, also 12, who moves in next door to him with her father. A pale, serious young girl, she only comes out at night and doesn't seem affected by the freezing temperatures. Coinciding with Eli's arrival is a series of inexplicable disappearances and murders. One man is found tied to a tree, another frozen in the lake, a woman bitten in the neck. Blood seems to be the common denominator. But by now a subtle romance has blossomed between Oskar and Eli, and she gives him the strength to fight back against his aggressors. (Magnolia Pictures)â€¦ Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "In the basest of terms, a horror flick. But it's also a spectacularly moving and elegant movie, and to dismiss it into genre-hood, to mentally stuff it into the horror pigeonhole, is to overlook a remarkable film.",
    "This is one of the real finds of 2008.",
    "At once a devastating, curiously uplifting inhuman drama and a superbly crafted genre exercise, Let The Right One In can stand toe-to-toe with Spirit Of The Beehive, Pan's Labyrinth or Orphee. See it.",
    "It's one of the great horror films of recent years -- and a welcome antidote to the in-your-face sonic assaults that all too often pass for genre fare.",
    "The best fairy tales always have so much darkness in them. That's why they resonate so deeply. This is a magnificent film.",
    "Could be summarized as a vampire tween romance, but that cheap and tawdry sum-up does zero justice to the magnificent emotional resonance of this gemlike bloodstone of a film.",
    "Stick your neck out for this Swedish horror show. It's a winner, full of mirth and malice, plus a young romance you'll never see on the Disney Channel.",
    "The young actors are powerful in draining roles. We care for them more than they care for themselves. Alfredson's palette is so drained of warm colors that even fresh blood is black.",
    "Funny, fear-inducing, with periods of voyeuristic gore and an undercurrent of anxiety and dread, Let the Right One In is up there with the bloodsucking classics.",
    "The beauty of Let the Right One In resides in the way the horror remains grounded in a tragic kind of love.",
    "Most contemporary horror films derive shocks from mere torture. Let the Right One In locates most of its fright-power in the needs and confusions of people who are usually overlooked.",
    "The most violent scene is dreamlike, and more direct killings are often seen at an angle or from a distance. The camera placement is thoughtful and effective, never titillating.",
    "It's a sweetly queasy film that suggests the spirit that sustains us, the demons we hide from the world, and the monsters that prey upon us in the dark might all be variations on the same beast.",
    "It's a little long and dissipates some of its power in an unfocused subplot, but the skewed sensibility of the film is both innocent and feral and offers a smart and satisfying reworking to the familiar genre. An American remake is already in the works.",
    "A coolly balanced and utterly compelling examination of alienation and love.",
    "Let the Right One In unfolds with quiet, masterly assurance.",
    "A moody adaptation of the Swedish best-seller about a fateful mortal-vampire romance, Let the Right One In is atypically literate and unexpectedly affecting suspense fare. Complex characters, ominous situations fraught with mortality and the recklessness of youthful ardor create a tense and subtly shaded narrative.",
    "Alfredson makes the most of every detail, carefully crafting an atmosphere of haunting alienation. These two lost souls may come together under unusual circumstances, but their connection feels universally human.",
    "In this sinister but gorgeous and compelling film by director Tomas Alfredson, being human and acting human don't always go together.",
    "There is a remarkable stillness to many of the film's most indelible images, particularly the exteriors, which are so carefully photographed, and without the usual tiresome camera jiggling, as to look almost frozen.",
    "An ingenious mixture of satire, dead-end suburban realism and gory vampire fantasy.",
    "It's a genuine genre vampire picture; and it's Swedish, winter-lit, Bergmanesque.",
    "A remarkably fine and genuinely frightening movie about a teenage vampire.",
    "Despite having no previous film experience, Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson give evocative performances as Oskar and Eli, respectively.",
    "Let the Right One In is a children's film, but you wouldn't want your child to see it. It's a horror film, but the gruesome splatter is the least of its scares. And it's a love story, but the prepubescent kind where sex is a distant idea and loneliness a shared reality. A wicked trick, a cinematic treat, this is some Halloween offering.",
    "Strikes a surprising array of notes: scary, sad and hopeful. The director, Tomas Alfredson, does a great job of presenting peril in the film.",
    "Some will classify Let the Right One In as a horror movie, and I suppose that's technically accurate. To me, however, this is much more of a coming-of-age/friendship movie.",
    "Calling to mind the work of Anne Rice and Stephen King, atmospheric adaptation of Swedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist's bestseller is well directed by his countryman Tomas Alfredson (\"Four Shades of Brown\") and should click with cult and arthouse auds.",
    "The Scandinavian moodiness of the first half gives way to a series of jolting set pieces in the second.",
    "If random arty blood thrills are your cup of fear, perhaps you'll enjoy Let the Right One In, a Swedish head-scratcher that has a few creepy images but very little holding them together."

The child actors act like real kids instead of 20 somethings pretending to be teenagers.

But the Swedish production thatGory thrillers are basically all that Scandinavian movies are famous for worldwide and Tomas Alfredson doesnâ€™t want to share away from this with his vampire flick Let the Right One In (LÃ¥t den rÃ¤tte komma in). But the Swedish production that has been showed at pretty much any film festival imaginable still isnâ€™t what youâ€™d call mainstream. The main characters are a twelve-year-old bullying victim and a vampiress of the same age  just that sheâ€™s been twelve for a longer time. Now does that sound odd to you? Well, it is. Damn right it is.\rTo spice up the somberly snowed landscape of the northernmost part of Europe with some blood is a great idea stylistically and the Dutch cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema knows exactly how can he make the murder scenes rememberable. However, heâ€™s quite a singularity with this in the cast of Let the Right One In. One could pick on the fact that the child actors donâ€™t feel genuine, the director has a way too austere approach to an unbelievable story, or that there isnâ€™t any suspense at all, but eventually, all boils down to the mixture of horror, drama, romance, and coming-of-age story that just doesnâ€™t work. For example, one scene shows a man brutally slaughtering another man, and the next shows the flirtation of two kids. But that alone wouldnâ€™t have ruined the movie for me  itâ€™s a handful of plainly ridiculous scenes that made it impossible for me to take Let the Right One In seriously. In one, a woman gets attacked by a dozen cats in a Scary Movie manner, in another one, the same woman ignites herself in a hospital bed, and what we also get to see are the bare nether regions of a twelve-year-old girl  a scene that confirms her previous comment, she isnâ€™t a girl. Oh, and the best is yet to come: a close-up shot of a man whoâ€™s burned his face with acid! Think of it like The Dar Knightâ€™s Two-Face with worse prosthetics.\rIf there arenâ€™t any of such idiotic moments, time is bypassed with boring dialogs, which accumulate to a sheerly unendurable sum over the course of almost two hours running time. All of this is disappointing, considering the potential some rare scenes show  as in the one, in which protagonist Oskar visits his divorced father and the lovely father-son-ambiance suddenly leaves as a buddy of his father stops by and leads him away from the offspring and to alcohol. This particular scene is short and mostly silent, but still probably the best of the film because it for once manages to emotionally affect the audience.\rThe overall product though, is really disappointing. You canâ€™t accuse Let the Right One In of using clichÃ©s, but that alone doesnâ€™t make a film original  in this case, it only makes it to an unfrightening horror film, an unmoving romance, and a drama too ridiculous to take seriously.",

First, the grim aesthetics made me squirm: everything is unremittingly ugly, faded, and bleak, and the characters show a typical Scandinavian lack of affect or animation (I do realize this is deliberate, but I've never liked the whole Lars von Trier masochism-as-art idea). Second, while the premise was admittedly original (a vampire story told from the perspective of children, without flinching on the violence and gore) the story is actually quite weak, replete with stock characters (the Inattentive Parents, the Bully, the Mysterious Girl Next Door), clumsily engineered twists (the guy brings a jar of acid to splash on his face so the police won't be able to identify him if he gets caught? What century does he think this is?), and a great deal of disturbing and improbable child-on-child violence, even when the vampire girl isn't around. Lastly, while I get that the movie is trying to make a point about how children can be both touchingly innocent and shockingly bloodthirsty (as when the protagonist fantasizes about stabbing the bullies with a hunting knife), I guess I'm just past the point where I think that kind of thing is cool and edgy. I like a nice cathartic bloodbath in a movie as much as anyone (heck, so did Shakespeare), but watching a roomful of scared kids get turned into chum by a creepy little girl left me no wiser about how violence begets violence or what-have-you; It was just disgusting and gratuitous, doubly so when you realize that she \"did it out of love\" or some such nonsense. Overall, an unsatisfying and pretentious film. I suspect the only reason it's received such good word-of-mouth is that the only people who bother to watch it are the ones who think doing so makes them seem sophisticated and clever.",

When I was telling a fellow filmophile about it, this morning, I had to acknowledge its debt to Bergmann, in that it is so minimalistic in its plot, dialogue, scenes, and cinematography. The children are pretty and I won't quibble with their acting. But my impression of the movie is that in its attempt at minimalism, it has achieved, instead, shallowness--a very different thing There is no depth to the characters or to the story. In Bergmann films, very often the characters are iconoclastic, representing ideas, principles, psychological states, classic conflicts, etc. It is apparent that this movie aspires to that import, but instead of archetypes, the characters are little more than caricatures. There is just not enough depth and substance to warrant the praise this movie has received--not in my humble opinion, anyway.",

I went in expecting a slight horror/thriller--and instead got a rather touching romance and allegory on the horror of childhood. What a brilliant surprise. As others have pointed out, the level of craft involved here is stellar in just about every aspect: direction, acting, cinematography, score, screenplay etc. It is in Swedish, but there's not a lot of dialog to begin with. I was a bit shocked to find there might be an american remake in the works as it seems unnesessary given how great this one is (& likely to turn out worse). If you can't find this in theaters, rent it as soon as you can. Just a great little film.",

The film was quite realistic, at least for a 12 year old vampire living in Sweden. Actually all kidding aside Let the Right One In was superbly acted. The two main child actors were real gems. Let the Right One In was also immensely rich with emotional depth. If this film did have a fault is that it was that it was persistently morose. [***WARNING POTENTIAL SPOILER***] What the director interprets (or tried to project) as a happy ending really was horrifying. Either that or Swedes are more depressive than I thought. OK it could be interpreted that Oskar was not Eli's butt monkey Renfield in that he did not eat bugs and probably wasn't simply being used by her to fulfill a need as her feeling for him seemed genuine. But still he did run away from home to help a serial killer, granted vampire by necessity. Yet vampires need love too, right? I guess the crux of the film was about the powerful mutual connection that evolved be-tween these two even in the mist of the most darkest of contexts, pure unadulterated (another pun) violence. Also that Eli nor Oskar's violent fantasies weren't simply portrayed as evil. There was a certain isness about the film in general that avoided moralistic dualities. In this sense was the strong existential and stoic undercurrents. In short Let the Right One In is the thinking man's/woman's film. Personally I prefer Buffy & Angel which are also highly philosophical yet gave the viewers a much needed breaks using comedy and social drama. However for what it was Let the Right One In was right on the money. If Ingrid Bergman made a film about vampire's this would be pretty darn close to the end product he might create. This is a compliment. But at the same time it's not always easy to stick with a Bergman film. They are the type of films you work at and hopefully come away with something more than just the taste of eye candy. In this case mission accomplished.",

And it is one of those movies that I spent a lot of time trying to convince myself that I was enjoying it. But at some point, (past the midway point), I finally gave up, and admitted this movie wasn't really working for me. From a narrative point of view, this story is a little too meandering. It definatively could have been tighter. I also left the theater thinking this story had been told from the wrong p.o.v. I would have preferred the story had been told from the girl's/vampire's point of view, than from the young boy's. It would have given us a better feel for her character. As it was I think her character was really kind of underwritten, and she almost comes off more as a plot devise, than as a real character. I understand the desire in a movie like tjhis is to have the vampire comes off as \"mysterious\", but you should be able to capture that with good, nuanced writing, rather than short-changing the character with the writing. I also keep reading that this is a great horror movie. But this isn't the least bit scary, nor suspenseful. What it really is, is an offbeat love story between 12 year-old children, dressed-up as a vampire story. And there is nothing wrong with that idea. All-in-all, this isn't a bad movie. It just isn't nearly as good as it has been made out to be.",

I had read so many incredible reviews for this film and the trailer had me wanting so much more.

I applaud the original take on the vampire genre and the subtle acting (especially from Lina Leandersson as Eli) but it's not the be-all, end-all.",

Don't mean to lose anyone there. This is quite a bizarre film but one that I would highly recommend, as somebody once recommended to me. The film was stunningly bleak to look at and its slow pace went down well with me. The two twelve year-old actors, playing twelve year-old characters, were incredible and it was crucial that this was the case because child actors can be pretty banal sometimes. I hear Hollywood are doing a remake but plan to call it \"Let me in\" because that is more catchy. Sounds like a tragedy already.",

It is more about these two young kids and their inevitable relationship. They relate on the fact that they are lonely in this world. The vampire myths are played to full, dramatic effect here, yet some how render more realistic than they would in say, Buffy. Also, the side-plots about his parents are interesting and sad. His mom hardly ever talks to him unless he's being yelled at, and his father gets his hopes up on togetherness but just throws it all away for a few shots.

If you are sick and tired of the sexy and sleak vampire stories of recent times like Twilight or True Blood (and I certainly am) give this movie a watch; I can't see how you could possibly be disappointed. For the story/plot I give the movie 8 out of 10. The story has the best of both worlds when it comes to American vs Foreign cinema. While it progresses at a pace that doesn't allow for drowsiness it still unfolds calmly and with a good amount of mystery; and things are not always explicitly explained, which I love. Aesthically/visually I give the movie 8/10. The cinematography is beautiful and there are sometimes some really interesting and creative shots. This movie definitely utilizes the power of visual storytelling. I would also like to point out in this section that the music is awesome! It's a really ambient orchestral score that fits totally well in the context of the movie and also stands on its own at times. Overall this film was top notch and one of the best movies in general I've seen in a while. I was completely engrossed from start to finish and I plan on watching it a second and third time very soon (if that's not a positive review of a movie I don't know what is). I took away 2 points out of 10 from my score because of a certain very silly scene involving some cats (you'll know when you see it) and because while it is freakin' awesome (seriously, see it) it is not so big a revelation as to warrant a 9 or 10 score reserved for the truly best pictures out there. There's no reason to be hesitant or timid about seeing this. It has such a high user AND critical score for a reason. Stop reading reviews and rent or stream this on a night when you can be engaged in a good movie. Don't sacrifice this beauty to that \"I'm pretty tired so I'll just throw on this movie until I fall asleep and finish it tomorrow\" kind of night.",
