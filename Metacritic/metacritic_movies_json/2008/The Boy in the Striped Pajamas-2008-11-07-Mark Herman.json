Through the eyes of an eight-year-old boy largely shielded from the reality of World War II, we witness a forbidden friendship that forms between Bruno, the son of Nazi commandant, and Shmuel, a Jewish boy held captive in a concentration camp. Though the two are separated physically by a barbed wire fence, their lives become inescapably intertwined. The imagined story of Bruno and Shmuel sheds light on the brutality, senselessness and devastating consequences of war from an unusual point of view. Together, their tragic journey helps recall the millions of innocent victims of the Holocaust. (Miramax Films)… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "And yet the great conundrum of the Holocaust is that it was perpetrated by human beings, not monsters. Few movies have rendered this puzzle so powerfully.",
    "The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is not only about Germany during the war, although the story it tells is heartbreaking in more than one way. It is about a value system that survives like a virus.",
    "Viewers should know that the film's resolution, though admirably restrained and unsentimental, is devastatingly sad. Parents should take this into account. This beautifully rendered family film is told in a classic and old-fashioned style, in the best sense, providing poignant and powerful teachable moments.",
    "Even though it unfolds almost entirely through a child's eyes, and contains no onscreen violence, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas packs as devastating a punch as an adult-oriented drama about the subject. Its concluding five minutes are almost impossible to watch.",
    "The film has any number of chances to exploit the setting and Butterfield's wide-eyed innocence, but instead, it mines a vast, eerie tension by keeping both boys in the dark.",
    "Turns out this is a thoughtful, well-acted film that manages to view this most inconceivable of travesties through the eyes of child without being childish itself.",
    "Boyne's tale is starkly cautionary, and writer-director Herman handles a difficult topic with great sensitivity, drawing splendid performances from his young actors with David Thewlis and Vera Farmiga and the other grown-ups reliably efficient.",
    "Opening half-hour has some of the best stuff in the movie, walking a precarious line between black irony and showing the war from a totally German viewpoint, without tipping over into gallows humor or parody.",
    "In adapting Irishman John Boyne's acclaimed young-adult novel, writer-director Mark Herman (Little Voice) draws beautifully modulated performances from his two child actors, who navigate a full range of emotions from wonder to betrayal to guilt.",
    "In key ways, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is like Guillermo del Toro's \"Pan's Labyrinth\": a child, caught in the waking nightmare of one of history's ugliest times, confronting the horrors of a grown-up world, and dealing with them as best he, or she, can.",
    "The power of this Holocaust tale sneaks up and floors you.",
    "Told from a different angle than any other Holocaust film I've seen.",
    "The result isn't meant to be an historical document transmuted into fiction; instead, it's fiction turned into a fable, a dark fable.",
    "Because its gaze is so level and so unyielding, it stands as one of the better dramatic films made on this subject (although it's not nearly as fine as Louis Malle's \"Au Revoir les Enfants.\"",
    "The film's two levels -- metaphoric and nitty-gritty -- don't mesh until the devastation of the closing sequence, which both indulges in and transcends melodrama.",
    "The Boy in the Striped Pajamas should be heartbreaking, but it isn't. The muted quality of its impact is the result of narrative shortcuts and a desire to keep the images from being too startling.",
    "Herman's intentions are admirable, but his results are unsettling in the worst ways.",
    "The film succeeds to the degree that it does -- partially, but honorably and sometimes affectingly -- because it was made as well as it was.",
    "The bulk of the movie consists of scene after scene coyly setting up the same ironic juxtaposition, in the exact same way, about innocence vs. Nazism.",
    "Although it's a far less objectionable Holocaust revision than, say, Roberto Benigni's \"Life Is Beautiful,\" Herman's The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is yet another attempt to revisit a sorrowful event in history that should never be forgotten or used for entertainment.",
    "True artists will risk sacrificing audience goodwill for truth and sentimentality for cold historical reality, but Herman doesn't want your respect; he just wants your tears.",
    "I found the movie impossibly basic and sanitized as a \"never again\" parable of the Final Solution - and simply wrongheaded as a story about children.",
    "The faux-naive point of view probably worked better in the novel; the literalness of film renders certain of the story's conceits overly precious.",
    "Herman fails to journey beyond the surface-level realities of his central perspective, which makes his film feel half-developed and poorly conceived, and drives it into sensationalism.",
    "Watching The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, it struck me that weaving a touching little tale about a death-camp friendship is actually a pretty bad way to teach kids about the Holocaust.",
    "An appalling, jaw-dropping movie that will cause serious nightmares.",
    "See the Holocaust trivialized, glossed over, kitsched up, commercially exploited and hijacked for a tragedy about a Nazi family. Better yet and in all sincerity: don't.",
    "This might have had some potential as a German exercise in self-examination, but as a tony BBC Films production, with the actors all speaking British-accented English (including Jersey girl Farmiga), it reeks of self-righteousness."

Actually, only for the fact of making films about fictional events in 2nd War became something cult. Even up to quite tiring. But what to say about this production in particular, among many others of the genre? First, it's curious that a film based on a book has only 90 minutes long. But this is not something that points the lack of content or material. On the contrary. There are movies that can perfectly flush this out and just The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas achieves that success. The film primarily deals with the innocence of a child, and this can be modeled as negatively in the wrong hands. And the narrative axis has support precisely in fraternal relationship between the boys, both in extremely opposite but at the same time demonstrating profound ignorance of everything that is happening. And of course, not unworthy of the supporting cast, which is a rather considerable, as can be seen with the judel Pavel, showing fear and constant insecurity. We have one final daring by today's standards, but that is precisely what generates all the impact on the viewer (yes, all), so that a passing sensation of pain, both physical and mental. Even though it is fictional, it does point out all the humiliation and brutality that millions of Jews suffered.",

This movie makes the atrocities very gritty as we see the son of an SS Commandant (David Thewlis) in charge of one of these camps befriend a young boy within the confinements, dressed in what the soldiers son Bruno (Asa Butterfield) believes to be striped pyjamas, completely oblivious as to what is really going on.\rThe more humanly and realistic tone comes from this soldier and his family, a very comfortable family with a wife and two children, a girl aged 12 who is simply doing what she is told and who falls even more deeply for the Third Reich as each day passes. There is also the Commandant's wife, who is unaware exactly what her husband's work consists of. She tries unsuccessfully for Bruno to enjoy their new home, but of course unbeknownst to her he is spending his time quite recklessly at the barbed wire fence of the camp and bringing food to this boy the same age as him, similar in curiosity, but these two have led very different lives, a pecking order if you will.\rDavid Thewlis playing the SS Commandant is quite the predicament indeed in terms of explaining what he is like in the role. When we become aware of his job and what his intentions are, there is shock to be had because of his humanity, which is either shedding light on these soldiers simply following orders or a poorly placed character, because at the end of the day, these people are murderers.\rThis is exactly where the film is at its best, it never necessarily cares about the political motivation of any of the characters, but showing the point of view of these two innocent and caught in the middle children, they don't quite know why they are where they are, but they soon add up that not everything is right.\rAn historically questionable but ultimately powerful film of friendship and humanity, that never fails to break the heart.",

Second it is the relationship between Bruno’s parents; this is special because the father hides info about his work to the mother, so when she discovers want the Germans are truly doing, the mother sinks into depression.

Nevertheless son Bruno happily goes out exploring and meets this other boy near a barb wired fence. Bruno at one side, in his typical little boys outfit, and Shmuel at the other side, in his striped pyjamas. Lucky for the story there is just one fence, and not three as at Auschwitz and, as the script will have it, there are no guards intervening in the broad daylight meetings. A relation develops. One eight year old boy belonging to the master race, and the other eight year old boy from the subhuman race, bonding, just like normal boys do everywhere..\rOf course it had to end bad. Bruno digs a hole under the fence and joins Shmuel at the other side(why not the other way around?), and then together they are marched of to the showers. Father is too late to intervene. A stack of clothes is all that is left of little Bruno.\rI wonder what would have happened if Father had made it in time? Get Bruno out, spank him for being disobedient and then send him to bed without dinner? Would he have ordered Shmuel released or have him beaten to death for luring his Arian son into a lethal situation?\rAnd then what happens?\rDoes father quit his job now he realizes what horrible things he does? Does mamma divorce him or curse him for the rest of his life?\rHas he all the Jews released?\rDoes he kill himself?\rDoes he kill Himmler?\rWhat impact has this?\r It is hard to judge a movie that means well, but is it really necessary to make up an unlikely story because you want to get the point across that killing people in extermination camps is bad? What is exactly the point of this particular story? Why does it exist? Is it made because it is more horrid that eight year old boys get gassed? Is it made because sweet little Arian Bruno get's gassed by accident?\rAnd why have the boys killed at all?\rCause that is better?\rPerhaps it would have been better if father had intervened in time or a guard:. \"Hey, aren't you the camp commandant's son?\" And Bruno gets pulled away from Shmuel, survives and now knows what a horrible man his father is and what is even more: his father knows he knows. Each look into Bruno's eyes will be a mirror to his own abject debasement. Too late Hoess(Auschwitz commander) to confess at your trial that what you did is bad after you killed a million people or so people. Far too late: they shouldn't have allowed you to confess at all.\rBut perhaps even more eyeopening would have been: Bruno totally indoctrinated by the Nazi lifestyle does not realize at all what is going on. Why should he? He is eight, he has been part of the Nazi culture all his life: he knows no other world: \"Just spare Shmuel, dad. He is my friend, not like the rest of them.\"  or \"Son, it has to be done.. it is better for the world. Sometimes we have to do things we don't like for the good of the whole..\"\rAnd then the cute Jewish boy gets gassed anyway.\rAnd it makes Bruno an emotional timebomb. Everyday his father looks at his son and wonders..at what age will he realize that what I did is horrible?\rAnd if you were making fantasy stories anyway.. why not make a perfect Arian family? Just like their propaganda wanted you to belief? The contrast between this perfect well functioning beautiful totally Nazi family and the situation in the death camps would have been bigger. And once Bruno knows.. then have the troubles start.\rOr not.\rWhy not have Bruno forget about Shmuel and have the happy Nazi family go on with their perfect life deliberately oblivious to what is happening some hundred meters away from them, because they do not want to know. Like was typical in Germany?\rAnd perhaps they have Shmuel for their pet Jewish houseboy? The only Jew to survive because he is the friend of Bruno and once Bruno has enough of him...\rNow that would have been a chilling movie.",

The boy in striped pajamas offers us a movie drama where the power of a young boy's feelings can over comes those who try to brain wash him into thinking jews are bad. Never have I been so moved by a movie before. This movie does not end happily so bring tissues if you tend to cry in movies. Asa butterfild does a fantastic job as the boy of a rich family who creates a bond with a Jewish boy who is in a Nazi concentration camp who also plays his role fabulously. Now don't get me wrong this movie has not been getting panned by critics and audiences alike butt 69% on rotten tomato's a 55 on metacritic come on guys really. Check this movie out but bring tissues it's fabulous.",

I like that you see the perspective of the Nazi's and that they were ordinary families (even though they had English accents). The problem with this movie is that Bruno, the main character, is so naive and never has any idea what the camps are despite living next to one for months. It's very unrealistic as he sneaks away from his home every day to visit another 8-year-old boy inside the concentration camp, who would never be able to sit next to the fence all day. The over-protective mother would have realized at least once her child was not in the backyard. The two boys sitting on either side of the fence stick their hands through several times and even dig underneath at one point. They certainly would have been shocked to death. The fact that neither one understands that people are killed, though when we enter it's plainly obvious, is hard to believe. It's so unrealistic neither children have any clue what's going on. It's unrealistic the mother doesn't realize her child leaves the house every day. While I really wanted to like this movie, things just don't add up.",

The film was directed by Mark Herman. It stars Asa Butterfield as a young German boy Bruno, David Thewlis as Bruno's father, a high-ranking Nazi officer, Ralf and Jack Scanlon as Jewish boy.   The film is set in Budapest during the Second World War.   It is essentially about the Holocoust through the eyes of a 9-year-old boy. At first a young boy Bruno lives with his family in Berlin in Nazi Germany but then they have to relocate to the countryside home that is walled off from a \"farm\" in the far distance. In fact, this farm is a concentration camp and the Bruno's father is a commmandant of the camp. Bruno's mother is kept in the dark for a long time about her husband's murderous duties. One day, Bruno goes beyond the wall, eventually arriving at an electric barbed wire surrounding the camp. There he befriends a Jewish boy, Shmuel. But their friendship is fatal...   I strongly recommend this unforgettable and poignant film, not only for pleasure but also for educational purposes. People and especially children should know the unspeakable truth about crucial historical events. Moreover, because of the little boy this film makes you feel the whole horror of that time and understand that we can not allow the same terrifying things to happen.",

      "content": "World War II and Nazism are themes that cinema has explored abundantly, and the list of good films grows every decade. The particularity that makes this film remarkable is that it takes us to see everything through the innocent eyes of aWorld War II and Nazism are themes that cinema has explored abundantly, and the list of good films grows every decade. The particularity that makes this film remarkable is that it takes us to see everything through the innocent eyes of a child, who cannot understand what is really happening, and to what extent his own family is involved in the atrocities that we know happened.Bruno is a child who lives a sheltered and carefree childhood. He is the son of a German army officer, and the family is wealthy. He knows that his country is at war and that his father is important, and he is helping his country to win the war. But this is basically all he knows or understands about what goes on in the Germany of his time. When his father is ordered to go to the countryside, Bruno is very sad to leave his house and his friends, but he meets a strange child, who wears striped pajamas and lives inside a fenced enclosure, which his mother does not wanted him to see. She's the only one in the family who really understands what her husband is there to do, and the only one to protest it all.The film is based on a novel written by John Boyne, but despite the source material and the film's fidelity to it, I wonder how immune a ten-year-old could really be to the avalanches of Nazi propaganda, considering that his father was a high-ranking official and the family had natural political connections to the Hitler regime. I don't mean to say that I disagree with Bruno's innocence and the way he doesn't know what's really going on, but it just seems hard to believe, since the Nazis used all means, including youth organizations and public education, to convey their ideology to younger people.The cast does a truly remarkable job. The spotlight naturally goes to Asa Butterfield and Jack Scanlon. The two young actors knew how to work perfectly and created a very good working relationship, which gives credibility to the friendship of their characters. It's their effort that makes the film particularly touching and human. David Thewlis also did an extraordinary job, incarnating in his character the contradiction of a loving and caring family man who is responsible for the planned and meticulous slaughter of a huge number of people. Is he a monster? Was he turned into a monster? In clear contrast, Vera Farmiga gives life to a courageous mother and wife, who finds herself in the need to protect her children from a reality she cannot agree with, and in which her husband is totally immersed. She is, like Bruno, able to see the human and innocent side of the people her husband says aren't \"really people\", even though she eventually has to silence what she really thinks about German politics in order not to suffer. Its consequences. Amber Beattie, on the other hand, shows us what happened to many German children and young people, victims of massive Nazi propaganda from an early age. Nevertheless, she is human, and her love interest in a young SS man reveals it, though it sends her further into the Nazi frenzy. The film also has the very relevant participation of Rupert Friend and David Hayman.Shot mostly in locations around Budapest, the film has a very beautiful, vivid, colorful and luminous cinematography, which fades and shadows as the film moves towards the end. There is a remarkable contrast between Bruno's house in the city (warmer colors, more light) and the gloomy house he goes to later (washed out colors, shadows, less light and a much heavier and more tense environment). The sets, costumes and props are good and in keeping with the time and context. I didn't see any anachronism errors. The soundtrack, signed by James Horner, is memorable and stays in the ear.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThis movie is an excellent example of emotional manipulation. It manipulates the audience into feeling sympathy for the family of Nazis based on two impossible conditions. It is based on the idea that the son of a SS Commandant would be completely oblivious to Nazi racial politics, and that a young Jewish boy would be left alive at Auschwitz or allowed to go anywhere near the fence. Both of these ideas are complete falsehoods and utterly impossible. During the period Auschwitz was killing Jews and other people deemed undesirable, enrollment in the Hitler youth would have been mandatory. It is impossible for the main character, Bruno, to escape indoctrination in that circumstance. He would have hated the Jews and never would have considered fraternizing with one of them. The Jewish child would have been immediately gassed as he is too young to work at the camp. If not that, he would have been shot or electrocuted for going anywhere near the fence. When the German child is killed in the end of the film, many reviews claim having felt sympathy and sorrow for his Nazi family. Need I remind anyone that these people are responsible for this genocide and are, at the very least, complicit!? This film is incredibly dangerous as it is either a clever masterstroke of emotional manipulation showing how easily a viewing audience can be seduced or a pathetic and horrendous cash-grab and misrepresentation of history. This film should be shunned or viewed with enormous prior historical context and as much annotation as Mein Kampf.",

Instead, it shows true evil from the eyes of the innocent. It is evil because it is evil. There is no bias through the eyes of a child, only a need to understand and to learn.

This film is meant to show us the consequences of committing truly evil acts. Lying to your child to protect them doesn't work, and lying to yourself that people aren't human because they're different doesn't work either. A human being is a human being, regardless of age, sex, or beliefs. Too often now, I believe viewers watch films that end \"happily ever after.\" The reality is: not everything ends happily. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas forces viewers to think in a realistic way, which clearly has some critics upset. We all seek understanding and comfort from our brethren, and I believe that this film shows us what we, as the human race, need more than anything else on Earth: companionship. It shows us that we'll do anything to find and keep those who mean the most to us.",

I remember being quite frustrated with how much we were taught aboutI liked that this film came from the childs angle, or view, showing how parents shielded kids from the reality of war, or more specifically of course concentration camps. I remember being quite frustrated with how much we were taught about the camps, the holocaust and the tragedy that was World War II in general, while in secondary school. In it being shown from a German childs point of view, it certainly tackles a very disturbing time, in a slightly different way to which im used to watching, which is why it interested me, also (admittedly) knowing its a 12 rate I presumed it wouldn't be too graphic, as ive seen enough graphic footage from that time, or depictions of such, for my liking. I liked seeing the boys inquisitiveness and the awkward reactions from relatives when quizzed about what went on in 'the farm'. The plot moves pretty slowly I suppose but I liked how it unfolded, with him slowly realising that things aren't what they first appear, becoming more unsettled and curious, even openly challenging the biased nationalistic teachings he's given from a presumed private tutor.On a basic level, I liked the innocence of the boy and the way he quickly and easily bonded with the Jewish boy, Schmuel - there's obviously a great sense of innocence and humanity conveyed. Of course this could come across as very sugary sweet and even over bearingly melodramatic but I felt it was handled well, with some hard hitting dialogue, Bruno being told the usual anti-Jewish propaganda, that 'the Jew' aka the entire race(!) are 'evil vermin', which he clearly knows is nonsense from his short but poignant conversations from the other side of the electrified camp fence - he even challenges this by asking/saying basically but there are nice Jews too, aren't there?. There is music used at key points but its quite subtle and not as over the top as it certainly could have been overall. It is, however, still very much an emotional movie, as you can probably imagine. At one point Bruno feels intimidated when confronted by a solider in his own home - one of his own people, who seems so authoritarian and cold to him, that he doesn't want to anger and so says what he believes is expected of him at that time, to 'toe the line' - I didn't feel such scenes were ruined by a ridiculous over use of musical score, although it does feature at times but as I say its quite subtle for the most part. The movie runs for approximately an hour and a half long, so its certainly pretty short, especially for a war based movie.  There are some scenes that may make you flinch but there isn't the graphic violence that there could be, or that features in other war movies of course - thankfully so, as far as I'm concerned. I found it interesting the way the plot developed, there are some interesting twists, which would potentially spoil the movie to go into detail about but ill put it this way, some adults are more aware of the full truth than others. I found it interesting the difference between Bruno and his sister, she being more aware and accepting, or embracing, of the then political standpoint. Overall, I'd say the men came off worse than the women though, with Bruno being the exception.I thought this was a very watchable movie, of course elements of it are grim but I found myself curious to see how events played out, to see Bruno's take on it and how others treated him and handled the situation. I liked that there did seem to be a sense of hope present, from the way that Bruno so basically and without qualms became friends with the prisoner and his drive to help him as the film continued, which I felt really gave a good sense of empathy, the fact that kids look at things and basically see people on such a basic, human level, if that makes sense?.",
