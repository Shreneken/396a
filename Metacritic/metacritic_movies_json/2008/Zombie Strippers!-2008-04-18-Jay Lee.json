    "critic_reviews": [
        "Director Jay Lee (The Slaughter) delivers absolutely everything you could possibly hope for in a film called Zombie Strippers, with a consistently hilarious, brutal, and titillating mash-up of \"Return of the Living Dead\" and \"Showgirls\" that actually beats out Mark Pirro's \"Nudist Colony of the Dead\" for the unofficial title of best naked zombie movie ever.",
        "Zombie Strippers is a B-movie whose ideas and wit set it well above the great unwashed of the genre.",
        "Whatever planet these dance sequences are happening on, their cuckoo surrealism is the movie's saving grace.",
        "On its own low-bar terms, it delivers the goods: pole-dancing, gut-chomping and Jenna J.",
        "Shouting the title never quite prepared me for either how stripping zombies aren't as hot or as funny as I thought they would be or how quickly the movie's eager intelligence collapses on itself.",
        "In spite of the horrific dialogue, and even worse acting, there\u2019s actually something to be said for Zombie Strippers!",
        "Shot on ugly digital video with Troma-grade special effects, campy humor and frighteningly bad acting, Zombie Strippers should provide many laughs for stoners watching it on video.",
        "Strewn with some surprisingly decent effects, this unevenly paced film delivers, if nothing else, on the promise of its title: lots of surgically enhanced nude dead women strutting their stuff.",
        "Jay Lee's grotesque little horror film makes up for in audacity what it might lack in finesse.",
        "The kind of entertainment perhaps better suited to drinking games than full viewer attention.",
        "The action can be bloody, but is mostly routine. Ultimately, the film\u2019s most eye-catching special effects are reserved for bikini waxes and implants.",
        "A brilliantly high-concept title and some decent gore aside, you're better off watching the version in your head. It will be infinitely more fun and have markedly improved production values.",
        "The movie, as its title suggests, means to be one of those Tarantino-esque in-your-face jobs, amusing on the audacity of its outrageousness. Here's how \"outrageous\" it is: Zzzzzz-zzzz.",
        "Currently stopping by theaters briefly en route to DVD, the film tries to position Jameson as the next Linnea Quigley, the B-movie queen behind such enduring titles as \"Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers\" and \"Sorority Babes In The Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama.\"",
        "Just a crappy flick for the Beavises of the world."

George Bush is dumb... uh huh...uh...\" The first 5 minutes of Zombie Strippers is the freshest, funniest, most biting social commentary I've seen in while, laying waste to the current administration-at-large, Bush, Cheney, Rove, etc, but in a more incisive, intelligent AND FUNNY style. I guess it would take a zombie movie (and/or a hardcore punk song) to really do it right. Now of course it's going to be the zombie-loving (and Jenna Jameson-loving) crowd which is going to want to see this flick, but I'd even recommend it to a wider action/comedy audience looking for some serious belly laughs. Robert Englund is fantastic and hilarious in his role as the strip-bar owner. The military unit in the obligatory medical-lab-experiment-gone-wrong sequence brings something new to the table. The strippers and their dialoge are pitch-perfect, and the writer's send up of ethnic, social, and political stereotypes is refreshing. I figured Jameson and the other strippers would be brain-dead placeholders in this thing, but they are truly fantastic. What made the movie so fun for me is that you're never so worried about the consequences of a massive outbreak beyond the strip club, and you're able to have fun with the petty jealousies between the strippers (who realize that only the zombie strippers are getting the love and $$ from the guys at the bar and, therefore, WANT to make the transformation), the creative zombie lap-dances, and the bar owner's obsession with the money-making potential of his \"evolved\" employees. The scene with the flying ping-pong balls and pool balls just blew the lid off of my theater - I was roaring. And the final face dance.... priceless! I would say next to the remake of \"Dawn of the Dead\", this is one of the best modern zombie flicks I've seen in a long time.",

Working on this movie seemed like a blast and that's enough for me to enjoy it on the right level. Yes it's filled with nudity, but it's also filled with a lot of gore, which is really appreciated for any horror fan out there. This will become a classic, a cult exploitation movie of modern days.
