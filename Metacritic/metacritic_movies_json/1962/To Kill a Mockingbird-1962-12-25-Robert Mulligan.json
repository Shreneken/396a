    "critic_reviews": [
        "To Kill A Mockingbird is a product of American realism, and it is a rare and worthy treasure.",
        "Storytelling doesn't get much better than this.",
        "To Kill a Mockingbird is a major film achievement, a significant, captivating and memorable picture that ranks with the best of recent years.",
        "As Mulligan so deftly demonstrates, the story is in the characters, their failings and fragility, their heroism and nobility of spirit. It's in the depiction of heart-breaking cruelty and heart-warming humanity. It's in the innocence of a child's world overshadowed by the evil that adults do.",
        "One of the year's most fetching and affecting pictures.",
        "To Kill a Mockingbird is a faithful adaptation of one of the 20th century's most important American works of literature. It is also a masterpiece in its own right. This is one of those rare productions where everything is in place - a superior script, a perfect cast, and a director who has a clear vision and achieves what he sets out to do.",
        "There is not only artistry in the development of the story - there is beauty, sympathy and emotional appeal in almost every scene.",
        "The film never slips into cheap melodrama, and ultimately offers a remarkable portrait of humanity at its best and worst, not to mention an ideal to which all people should aspire.",
        "Their charming enactments of a father and his children in that close relationship that can occur at only one brief period are worth all the footage of the film.",
        "Peck's icy remove works for once\u2014as a kid's idea of a parent, he's frighteningly effective.",
        "A hauntingly nostalgic portrayal of childhood mischief set in a racially divided Alabama town in the 1930s. If the film's tone sometimes seems overly righteous, it's offset by a poetic lyricism that is difficult to resist embracing.",
        "The film sits somewhere between the bogus virtue of Kramer's The Defiant Ones and the poetry of Laughton's Night of the Hunter, combining racial intolerance with the nightmares of childhood, born out of Kennedy's stand on civil rights and Martin Luther King's marching.",
        "To Kill a Mockingbird, set in Maycomb, Alabama, in 1932, uses the realities of its time only as a backdrop for the portrait of a brave white liberal.",
        "To Kill a Mockingbird is by no means as irreproachable as our memories would lead us to believe but it\u2019s still a gripping yarn and well worth revisiting."

To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best adaptations of a book, it is not only faithful to the source material but it almost improves on it. Do I haveTo start with, the book is absolutely wonderful with great characters and a moving story. To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best adaptations of a book, it is not only faithful to the source material but it almost improves on it. Do I have any criticisms? Not really, other than to say that the film is a tad overlong for my liking. But it is a brilliant film, with a beautifully crafted story that still maintains the emotional punch of the book about a lawyer in the Deep South and the effect of the rape trial on his children. The film is beautifully shot, the whole film is incredible to watch, and the score is sensitive. The script is effective and sticks closely to the book, and the direction from Robert Mulligan is very impressive. The acting is really good, I have read that Henry Fonda would have been better for Atticus Finch, although Fonda was a great actor, Gregory Peck does give a superb and career-best performance in this film. And he is very well supported by an excellent Robert Duvall as disturbed Boo Radley, while Mary Badham and Phillip Alford are very well-cast as the children. Overall, a wonderful and faithful adaptation and just an excellent film really. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",

I envy those who in 1962 could appreciate this jewel in cinemas, because certainly, it is a film that address different issues, including racism, poverty, justice, morals, transports us to our childhood making us children again in clothes of Jem, Scout and Dill, transporting us to our younger years, and confirming that good triumphs over evil. Undoubtedly, To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), becomes one of my favorite movies.",
