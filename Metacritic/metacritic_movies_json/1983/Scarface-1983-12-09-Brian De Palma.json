    "critic_reviews": [
        "Scarface is one of those special movies, like \"The Godfather,\" that is willing to take a flawed, evil man and allow him to be human.",
        "Perfomances are excellent, and despite its moralistic conclusion, the film has since become de rigueur viewing for crack barons, who know a good shoot-em-up when they see one.",
        "A beautiful, at times poetic exercise in excess from Brian De Palma.",
        "Scarface is the most stylish and provocative - and maybe the most vicious - serious film about the American underworld since Francis Ford Coppola's \"Godfather.\"",
        "It is a serious, often hilarious peek under the rock where nightmares strut in $800 suits and Armageddon lies around the next twist of treason.",
        "Scarface is a grandiose modern morality play, excessive, broad and operatic at times.",
        "Brian De Palma dedicates this 1983 feature to Howard Hawks and Ben Hecht, authors of the 1932 original, though I doubt they would find much honor in his gory inflation of their crisp, 90-minute comic nightmare into a klumbering, self-important, arrhythmic downer of nearly three hours."

That is to a large point understandable depending on your taste. However, Scarface is a very different film. I like that itPerhaps my favorite movie of all-time. Often compared to legendary heavyweight The Godfather, and often as inferior. That is to a large point understandable depending on your taste. However, Scarface is a very different film. I like that it manages to fit in a lot more humor and I find the very human characters the big draw. The Godfather has a much more calculating tone, whereas Scarface is much more volatile.What makes the movie so great is that it doesn't hold your hand and tell you what to think of Tony Montana or anyone else. It lets you take its wide cast of colorful characters. To me, Tony is a manifestation of very human desires - but he has a fascinating drive, passion, and intensity that is unparalleled. While it is a cautionary tale, I find plenty to admire in him. Unlike Michael Corleone in The Godfather, he is not thrown into the dark world of organized crime - he largely throws himself in. (with the help of hard drugs) But, we understand where his lust for the American Dream comes from when we consider his smothered upbringing.I feel that the movie has aged very well and isn't nearly as cheesy as a lot of movies from its era. It did what it set out to do. Sit back and enjoy the ride.",

While I was thinking about this, it went on the whole new level with the violence for the most part because it's directed by Brian De Palma. I know he's not going to make a movie overly violent to get an NC-17. Al Pacino as Tony Montana is what everyone loves, his character is incredible with his Cuban accent and his dialogue. He has his friend, Manny and a younger sister and later takes over Frank Lopez' place and becomes addicted to cocaine. This is the first time that you'll see Steven Bauer and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio in the film. I love the soundtrack in this movie. The soundtrack is awesome and amazing. It actually came before Grand Theft Auto III which is amazing. I love all the songs in this such as \"Rush Rush\", \"Shake It Up\", \"Push It To The Limit\" my personal favourite along with \"She's on Fire\" and \"I'm Hot Tonight\". If you forgot about that Scarface starring Al Pacino is the original version, think again. This is a remake to the B&W film from the 1930's. Scarface is the original film shot in B&W in the 30's and now you're looking at the ultimate gangster and I mean, the ultimate badass! Al Pacino does a great job as Tony Montana. He's unforgettable in this. \"You wanna play rough? Okay. Say hello to my little friend!\" \"You know what I'm talking about, you f**king cockroach.\" And the script is great and it's written by the director Oliver Stone which is a surprising thought. He was Tony Montana. The world will remember him by another name ...Scarface.",

Al Pacino is of course amazing, he's pretty much amazing in everything he does, but as far as the film goes, its centered on this masochistic **** who was never happy with what he had. Tony Montana, was never a hero or someone who was meant to be looked up to as one of the greatest characters of all time. As far as Mob films go, Scarface is so much easier to follow then most, as the timeline makes sense, and you're not introduced to new people every five minutes. While Al Pacino is terrific, the mumbled lines and enormous greed leave something to be desired. Not to mention that when you break things down, isn't the film really just business meeting, gunfight, personal life, repeat? After a while the film feels like it's going around in circles and really is kind of stale. People will always remember this film for it's epic finally, taglines, and the great Al Pacino, but as far as stories go, this one isn't something I would consider a classic or a can't miss film. Scarface has it's moments and has to be at the top of the list for action junkies, but beyond that, I found the story to be just your run of the mill mafia tale, focused on a guy, who was too greedy and too stupid to hold onto everything he worked so hard for.",

Now, it was entirely over the top and insanely violent, which hampered my enjoyment of it a tad. But, this look at a purely evil man that shows all the faults surrounding a man so evil is brilliant. On top of that, the over the top nature of this one is admittedly very fun. While the blood and violence can certainly be excessive, it has the comic feel to it that dulls the blow, thankfully. On top of that, the acting is great, especially Al Pacino. His accent may be a little much, but it really works with every over the top element here. The direction from Brian De Palma is also very strong. I honestly think this was the perfect project for him and he did a great job with it. The writing from Oliver Stone is also great and endlessly quotable. It is not hard to see how this one has such a long-lasting life after its release considering how quotable and enjoyable it is. Luckily, it is also expertly made. Overall, Scarface will likely scare away those with weaker stomachs, but if you can make it, it is entirely worth it. While I did not love it, I can certainly see why it gets so much praise.",

Not to say that this isn't a good movie. Some of the great aspects of this film are that it focuses on a unlikable type a person, a hitman I think. Al Pacino gives an overtop, extreme performances as the main lead, and is enjoyable throughout. I guess I should talk about the story. It's about this man who arrives from Cuba and wishes to fulfill the American dream of getting a ton of money. The simple viewing of watching the uprising of this man is simply fascinating and intriguing. One of the most notorious tales about this movie is that it has a record; almost, for most swear words uttered in a film; until South park. The violence in this is a bit over the top, especially the chainsaw scene, but is \"almost\" over the top, I say that because other than that one scene it's not that graphic. So I say again that the biggest treat this film gives us is the simple joy of watching the life of this person who we'd normally not want to associate with. I would say this is definitely worth a viewing, and despite what some may say of it being a copy of The Godfather, but should be viewed only by mature viewers.",

It's a film I first saw 20 years ago on an ex-rental 'Widescreen' VHS tape, a tape I subsequently bought from the shop for a couple of quid and watched with some of my friends almost religiously ever since.",

Every expectation I had for this movie was exceeded: I wanted to see guns, strong language, and the development of a wild mob boss; Guess what? That\u2019s exactly what Scarface delivers. From Uzi\u2019s to chainsaw\u2019s Scarface has multiple scenes containing these caliber guns\u2019 which were used back in the 80\u2019s, and not to spoil anything, but blood is always spilled after these guns are fired. To fallow up with the guns; Scarface displays loud and disgusting language that gives the viewer a punch to the face. One quote that you will most likely remember after watching this movie is \u201csay hello to my little friend.\u201d Which I will only say leads to a major climax after Tony Montana played by Al Pacino says those words. Talking about Scarface how can I write this review without praising the man himself Mr. Al Pacino; the man is just gold around silver actors. Pacino plays Tony Montana a Cuban gangster with ambition to be big in the world, and that ambition ultimately leads him to become the biggest mobster in Miami. The movie Scarface is just a classic\u2014you have to watch.",

Since it\u2019s release the movie has gone through extensive revaluation, now regarded as one of the best mob movies ever made and has been extensively referenced in pop culture (especially in hip-hop and most visibly in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City).Seeming to take a break from ripping off Hitchcock, De Palma ultra-stylized direction gives way to a lot of memorable sequences such as the infamous \u201cchainsaw\u201d sequence and the climactic assault on Tony\u2019s mansion (SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND!!). Not only that, but the screenplay written by Oliver Stone (which was written while battling his own cocaine addiction) is littered with endless quotable dialogue and elevates the sleazy gangster affair into an almost Greek tragedy level of high-art.Al Pacino\u2019s over-the-top accent can get a little grating at times but even though it clocks in at nearly three hours, it never stops being ferociously entertaining.",

There's no doubt that Oliver Stone is a great screenwriter, but with Brian De Palma behind the cameraScarface is one of the most iconic, and one of the most quotable movies ever for a good reason. Throughout this movie I kept repeating WOW! There's no doubt that Oliver Stone is a great screenwriter, but with Brian De Palma behind the camera Oliver Stone's screenplay became very very entertaining, not just smart. I felt I was watching a movie its script is written by Aaron Sorkin, and is directed by Martin Scorsese! Al Pacino delivered a powerhouse performance as Tony Montana which, in my opinion, is the second best performance in his long career, just right behind his exceptional performance as Michael Corleone in The Godfather II. I don't want to say that Al Pacino's performance elevated the movie, because the movie is already great, but as a matter of fact, Scarface couldn't have become a classic without his iconic performance.Speaking of the Godfather, Scarface also is a movie that takes a bad guy and allow him to be a human. The result is a nasty, and vicious protagonist that you couldn't help but root for. But it doesn't stop here, In this movie I didn't only sympathized with Tony Montana, but I also sympathized with the people Tony Montana care about the most. I cared about his relatives that I was about to shed some tears, in a gangster flick!!!!The pacing is fast, and that was very acceptable. But at the last hour the movie dragged a little bit, but it picked up very quickly, and I found myself very engaged again.Also, I have to mention the De Palma's spectacular representation of the Magic City, Miami. And the movie's electrifying soundtrack. Scarface is one of the best gangster films of all-time that doesn't only entertain, but it also a great character study, and has an underlying moral philosophy. And above all things, it's the most Scorsese-esque film not directed by Martin Scorsese.(9/10)",
