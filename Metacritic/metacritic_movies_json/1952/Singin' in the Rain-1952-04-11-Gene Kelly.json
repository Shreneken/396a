  "summary": "A silent film production company and cast make a difficult transition to sound.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Watching Singin' in the Rain is an exuberant, magical experience – a journey deep into the heart of feel-good territory. Sitting through the film's 102 minutes is like ingesting a mood-altering drug. It's the perfect antidote to the blues and the blahs, and a way to bolster, enhance, and extend a natural high.",
    "In this picture, the screen’s greatest dancer contributes some of his art of choreography for the special pleasure of movie audiences.",
    "Incredible set pieces and songs that have entered the culture forever, this is also extremely well-paced and beautifully played. Truly one of the greatest musicals ever made.",
    "Still the wittiest of all the MGM musicals of the 1940s and '50s.",
    "If you've never seen it and don't, you're bonkers.",
    "Many things reinforce the enduring greatness of Singin’ in the Rain, but its most charming element is the filmmakers’ love for and dedication to the basic tenants of cinema as pure enchantment, and an open indulgence of all the bells and whistles that have been allowed it to grow into something bigger and (arguably) better over the decades.",
    "A wonderful parody of the birth of talkies that has great wit, an intelligent script, terrific music and dancing that can't be beat.",
    "Singin’ in the Rain might have been the last musical of the ’50s to convey irrepressible optimism through what Alan Greenspan would call “irrational exuberance.” But what exuberance! Look at it and try to think of a contemporary picture that has half as much vivacity, fun, joy. When your movie-loving grandpa says, “They don’t make ’em like they used to,” he is surely thinkin’ of Singin’ in the Rain.",
    "Escapism raised to the level of art, Singin' In The Rain inventively satirizes the illusions of the filmmaking process while celebrating their life-affirming joy. Half parody, half homage, the movie became the apex of the splashy MGM musical, while showcasing the collaborative possibilities of the studio system.",
    "Very likely the greatest musical MGM or anyone else ever produced, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN has everything--great songs, great dances, a wonderful, nostalgic story, and a dependable cast, although we're beginning to find Kelly and O'Connor a trifle overanimated in scenes they needn't be (butthen whenever we see the talented yet obsequious Mr. Kelly play modest, we get a strange olfactory sensation--that of ham baking)",
    "One of the shining glories of the American musical, this 1952 feature was fabricated (by screenwriters Betty Comden and Adolph Green) around a collection of old songs written by producer Arthur Freed and brought to bright, brash, and exuberant life by directors Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly. The setting is Hollywood's troubled transition to sound, and there is just enough self-reflexive content (on the eternal battle between illusion and reality in the movies) to structure the film's superb selection of numbers.",
    "Singin' in the Rain is a transcendent experience, and no one who loves movies can afford to miss it.",
    "With so many films dedicated to the agonies of filmmaking, Singin’ overflows with the pleasure of movie creation, stitching together references to Hollywood history with more alacrity than Tarantino. One of the highpoints of hoofin’ history but, more importantly, an unadulterated joy.",
    "With the names and versatile talents of Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds, supported by lilting melodies, wonderful dancing and some very funny comedy, the show just can't miss being another MGM top-grosser.",
    "Concocted by Arthur Freed with showmanship know-how, it glitters with color, talent and tunes, and an infectious air that will click with ticket buyers in all types of situations.",
    "The nonsense is generally good and at times it reaches the level of first-class satiric burlesque. Adolph Green and Betty Comden may have tossed off the script with their left hands, but occasionally they come through with powerful and hilarious round-house rights."

The story is based on a real fact: the rise of sound cinema and the consequences it has brought to an endless number of actors and actresses, whose bad voice or diction wouldn't allow their career to continue. The film stars Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Jean Hagen, who bring to life a love triangle that supports the entire film. The script is extraordinary and doesn't deserve critical, as well as the cast performance. Kelly and Reynolds solidified their stardom with this film, in all fairness, for they are amazing together and excellent when separated. Jean Hagen gives life to some of the film's most hilarious moments. As far as music and songs are concerned, they are truly beautiful and some of them are in the ear. It is not by chance that most of the songs in this film have gone to the history of cinema and have become as immortal as the movie itself.",

The \"Singin' in the Rain\" scene was wonderful, I really liked the Hollywood satire and the depiction of the troubled transition from silent cinema. The psychical performance by O'Connor in the \"Make 'em Laugh\" scene was incredible, and much of the comedy still works very well today and is quite witty. It's filled with charming musical numbers and impressive choreography, and it's such a joy to watch Gene Kelly, Reynolds and O'Connor grace the screen. A timeless film.",

The journey andwhat a night! ladies and gentlemen, what a night..Singin' In The RainAn epitome to a musical genre feature where choreography, production design and background score blends into the perfect combination in a poetic tone. The journey and the transition depicted in here of all the characters; as they aren't palpable to their surrounding anymore, is written explicitly on paper by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. And the rest of it is left to Stanley Done and Gene Kelly; the directors, whose enthusiasm and affection towards the musical acts is crystal clear and they fortunately are able to apply it all in here. Gene Kelly has done a decent work on performance too with Debbie Reynolds and Jena Hagen as a supporting cast but the real game changer is Donald O'Connor who is flat out hilarious in his portrayal. Singin' In The Rain is one of those rare art that just happen to have everything in the right place and if accounted into one big musical opera there lies a genuine soul in it.",

It’s so joyful and energetic, the cast is so charming and entertaining to watch, the music is very well done, and it’s overall just a fun watch. The actors all have great chemistry, and the film never slows down or loses steam; it just... goes. The main reason I don’t like musicals is because I feel like I’m watching two different movies with drastically different styles, but Singin’ in the Rain doesn’t have this problem. It keeps a consistent tone and pace in both dialogue and song.",

There's one, maybe two, good songs that I had already heard, while Gene Kelly (Don) is solid fun in the lead role. The premise, minus the music, is actually very interesting, what with the silent film transition era. Given it's a musical, though, they don't delve as deep into that as I wanted.None of the songs, aside from the previously alluded to \"Singin' in the Rain\", landed well with me, I kinda found them a chore to sit through to be frank. Elsewhere on the cast, aside from Kelly, I found Debbie Reynolds (Kathy) alright but Donald O'Connor (Cosmo) a little irritating - he tries too hard, for my liking. Jean Hagen (Lina) is likewise a tad annoying, though that's intentional with her to be fair.I will acknowledge that the film, aesthetically, looks excellent. I wish I liked it more overall, but I just didn't. Do feel free to ignore me!",
