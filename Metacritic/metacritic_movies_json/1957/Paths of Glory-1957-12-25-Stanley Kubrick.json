  "critic_reviews": [
    "This is the director’s most vivid, most emotional and humane film, and perhaps his best.",
    "Banned in France for 18 years, this masterpiece still packs a wallop, though nothing in it is as simple as it may first appear; audiences are still arguing about the final sequence, which has been characterized as everything from a sentimental cop-out to the ultimate cynical twist.",
    "Paths of Glory was the film by which Stanley Kubrick entered the ranks of great directors, never to leave them.",
    "It is arguably the best film about the first world war, and still has a reasonable claim to being Stanley Kubrick's best film.",
    "One of the greatest war films ever made.",
    "Kubrick’s film vividly depicts the harsh realities of war and remains a great anti-war drama.",
    "This is a harrowing and still very effective antiwar film that ranks with Lewis Milestone's epic All Quiet On The Western Front in its power.",
    "As the anger simmers, Kubrick’s camera remains detached, patrolling the trenches, pacing the courtroom. Terse and remorseless it may be, but the final flourish is perhaps the most fitting gracenote in all of cinema.",
    "Hardly a flattering portrait of the military machine, Paths of Glory suggests a soldier’s best hope often is to survive the chaos that his or her own army causes.",
    "Paths of Glory undoubtedly succeeds in both foreshadowing the bravura auteurism that was to come as well as lampooning the abhorrent bureaucracy that destroyed the lives of so many brave young men in Europe's trenches.",
    "The searing Paths Of Glory continues to impress with its striking blend of formal brilliance, economical storytelling and emotional directness.",
    "The sardonic rhetoric may be laid on a little heavily at times, but the movie is blunt and scornfully brilliant.",
    "Paths of Glory is all about that greatest of all movie subjects: power.",
    "Paths of Glory may be first-rate humanity, but it’s also second-rate art.",
    "Mr. Kubrick has made it look terrific. The execution scene is one of the most craftily directed and emotionally lacerating that we have ever seen. But there are two troubling flaws in this picture, one in the realm of technique and the other in the realm of significance, which determine its larger, lasting worth.",
    "While the subject is well handled and enacted in a series of outstanding characterizations, it seems dated and makes for grim screen fare."

OutI saw this movie for the first time on television today, after being persuaded by the reviews I read beforehand praising it. Also I like Kirk Douglas. Although I am not directly familiar with Kubrick's work, a shameful admission I know. Out of what I have seen so far I loved Dr Strangelove and despite only seeing it once while flicking through channels liked The Shining too. Anyway back on target, Paths of Glory was brilliant in my opinion!Winston Churchill famously claimed that it was this movie that was closest to evoking the atmosphere of WW1 and the military mind. And you know what, he is right. For one thing, Paths of Glory is gorgeously filmed, with relentlessly beautiful cinematography and nice costumes and scenery. The screenplay is sometimes humorous, sometimes moving and sometimes even haunting, either way it was some fine writing. The efficiency of Kubrick's direction is proof of a great man at work.The performances were superb. As the general who orders the hopeless attack on the German position, Adolphe Menjou's character is perceived as a villain not because of being an officer adhering to the letter, but that he is seen as \"the arrogant aristocrat\" because of his fear of the working classes than his hatred of the enemy. Among the cast, Timothy Carey and Kirk Douglas especially were outstanding. And the music? That is one rousing score I can tell you. Great movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox",
