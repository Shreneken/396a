  "critic_reviews": [
    "The movie plays like a textbook for directors interested in how lens choices affect mood.",
    "A penetrating, sensitive, and sometimes shocking dissection of the hearts and minds of men who obviously are something less than gods. It makes for taut, absorbing, and compelling drama that reaches far beyond the close confines of its jury room setting.",
    "What's most interesting about the intense deliberations that ensue, specifically when a piece of seemingly indisputable evidence is brought back into question, is how a fresh angle and perspective, usually born from Juror 8's critical thinking, can permanently alter the tone of the discussion.",
    "Few film directors can resist the urge to \"open out\" a story, to broaden the view and bring in as wide a variety of sets and locations as the narrative - and budget - will allow. The genius of Sidney Lumet's astonishingly powerful 12 Angry Men is that he does exactly the opposite: he takes an already small, claustrophobic space - a jury room - and makes it even more confined.",
    "Too few films take on the art of arguing as a subject; we could certainly use more of them, but until then, Lumet’s window into strained civic duty will continue to serve mightily.",
    "Sidney Lumet's dazzling debut, based on Reginald Rose's teleplay, delivers a masterclass in the pure dynamism of acting, as Henry Fonda's reasonable doubt gradually sways the 11 other jurors from their various prejudices.",
    "Although 12 Angry Men dismays at human weakness, it is fundamentally an optimistic film, celebrating reason and basic human decency in equal measure. In an era when both seem in short supply, Lumet’s film is a reminder that there is never a bad time to stand up for what is right.",
    "Henry Fonda, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, and Jack Warden lead a cast that glues you to the screen and never lets you go till the final verdict.",
    "Rounded out by an incredible cast, Lumet’s realisation of Reginald Rose’s script didn’t require anything too bold or exaggerated. It simply took 12 men in a single room with something important to talk about.",
    "Though the jury in 12 Angry Men reaches a verdict, neither Rose nor Lumet definitively state whether they're \"right.\" The point—as Lumet well knows—is that when it comes to making sense of a picture, a lot depends on the framing.",
    "Perhaps the motivations of each juror are introduced too quickly and are repeated too often before each changes his vote. However, the film leaves a tremendous impact.",
    "What really transforms the piece from a rather talky demonstration that a man is innocent until proven guilty, is the consistently taut, sweltering atmosphere, created largely by Boris Kaufman's excellent camerawork. The result, however devoid of action, is a strangely realistic thriller.",
    "The stakes of those deliberations are so high, the personalities of the jurors so forceful, and the arguments so pregnant with importance that there is no instance in which boredom threatens.",
    "Mechanically written, but within its own middlebrow limitations, it delivers the goods."

I wish I can bring up every single actors name in this cast but I'm not since these 12 of them and it's going to take up the all page and I can't talk about every singe actor and go into detail about them one at a time, but I can say that everyone in the movie did a flawless work of acting that's pure Oscar worthy and the kind of drama acting they should show kids in drama school. Nicely done fellas.Sidney Lumet directed this movie and this has to be some of the best directing I've seen from this guy. He really added a lot to this movie when it came to story and characters and the back and forward they have with each other and it worked by his direction.The characters in the movie (The Twelve Angry Men) don't really like each that much as in every scene they at each other's throat trying to confidence the other men in the room that the man is guilty for murder while that person and the other's bring up some really solid points that this man is guilty or not guilty for murder. As a viewer myself I got really interested in the case and trying to think if he's guilty or not, so this movie does a fantastic job of giving the viewer a opinion on the case and see if you think he did it or not.For problems with the movie: I don't have any.Overall 12 Angry Men is such a classic movie with excellent performances from everyone, the writing outstanding and the directing was some of the best. You haven't seen 12 Angry Men then I say go see it, it's worth your time.",

It gives a lot of food for thought regarding issues of prejudice and is a prime example as to how a negotiation should and should not be done. My main take away from this film would be the importance of keeping an open mind when approaching people and issues. We need to be constantly be aware of our own personal bias and think critically, never taking things at face value. Through this process, we can then be more enlightened and make wiser decisions and opinions.",

Cobb steals every scene (and that is not easy to do in a film like this). Ed Begley, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Jack Klugman, Joseph Sweeney, E.G.

On the surface it is about 12 jurors that are counseling about a verdict in a murder case. On the inside it is as much about the jurors themselves, justice, life philosophies, psychology, group dynamics and responsibility. The whole movie takes place in just one room. There are no distractions and each misstep would hurt this movie badly. This is the ultimate strength of this movie. There are no mistakes, out of character moments, bad dialogues, wasted scenes or other errors. The cast and the acting is so close to perfection as possible. Each juror delivers his role in such a genuine way that I cant find a single flaw in this movie. If I praise the actors I must also praise the director Sidney Lumet. He should definitely have gotten more Oscars in his career (He made many great movies).  I want also to mentioned that I first watched this movie when I was 12 or 13 years old just by zapping trough the channels. This was something that shouldn't work at this age. I stopped zapping and started to watch this movie with fascination. As I got older it got even better as I did understand many things more with my additional life experience. Overall this is a timeless classic that is deservedly highly praised and should be watched by everyone at least once.",

It's like they found a perfect way of making a film, play out like a book.There's one scene, towards the end where one character, whose been stubborn all the way through is starting to be really bigoted and crass. Each character slowly stands up and faces away from him, whilst he's ranting on...he's eventually left on his own, symbolising the whole groups shift in emotion.  powerful.",

Sidney Lumet has certainly directed one of the greatest films in cinema history with the script and screenplay made to perfection by Reginald Rose. A stellar and perfectly picked cast with Henry Fonda leading the line. A film very unlucky not to win best any Oscars but another great film in Bridge on the River Kwai just piping it however, I do think that 12 angry men should have won best writing over Bridge on the River Kwai however it still a complete classic which deserves all the praise in the world. What makes this film so good is that it is so compelling and edge of the seat action of a different sense to an action film. A film that continuously makes you think.

Sidney Lumet's direction is masterly, and although the action takes place on one set(an actual New York drawing room) there are a huge variety of innovative camera angles and visual set-ups. The screenplay is sophisticated and smart, and the story is compelling and intelligent. The film is also brilliantly made, and the acting is superb. Henry Fonda especially dominates the film, with an integrity that makes his character so wonderful, but the other actors are wonderful as well, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, John Fiedler, Lee J Cobb, Rudy Bond et al. are all impeccable support to Fonda. Overall, brilliant courtroom drama. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Il aurait fallu une affaire bien plus ambigüe pour rétablir la balance et partant, le doute.Ici, on a l’impression fort désagréable de s’être fait manipuler pendant une heure et demi : tout était écrit d’avance et les faits s’y sont pliés bien gentiment, ne nous laissant qu’une illusion de rebondissements qui n’en sont pas.

And sure as I presumed it would happen like that but this isn't a mystery. This is not a who dun it,instead it's a philosophical quandary on the the ethics of truth. It's objective is to show just how easily one's idea of the truth can change and what that can be done by which is especially relevant to the time period of the 50's. It effectively through exaggerated characters confronts classism, racism, macarthisim and generational divides without making it's intent glaringly obvious . Overall this classic is a gripping answer as to the power and fallacy of the legal system from the court appointed defense attorney with little care for the case to the nonchalance of life ending decisions by those who won't be affected asking us to extend the empathy we'd want to other's",

This film is not the type of films that I watch in general... But I liked it because it's diversified and represents a lot of different subjects. The good actors that they are, like Henry Fonda, play very well their role. The film shows us that it can be complicated to take an important decision, when we are not the only concerned person. Indeed, throughout the film, with the different points of view of the 12 jurors, we ask us what will be the verdict of the accused, that creates an interesting plot for the spectators ! Also, there are a lot of biblical comparaisons that show us the believer aspect of the american society at this time.  So, this film is interesting, because it stages different themes and aspects of the american society in the late fifties, and especially the fact to know to live in society and take decisions together.

My favorite is the juror number 8, He shows an example that everybody should listen: not to do as others do, but focused on yourself and make the choice that you want without listening other persons’s opinion. I really liked too, the fact that we can see the motivations which make the jurors change their votes. It shows us the thought that people had in this period, and makes us compare with the society where we live now, and see the different that there is, and sometimes they’re exactly the same, which proves that even in more that 60 years nothing change about people’s though.

That's the beauty with this film, it tackles issues that were and still are apart of our society. When watching it, you immidiately make connections with actuality, which can be a little shocking because observing that racism and discrimination still are things in which people believe may be a little depressing.But it also, on a more positive note, shows that there are solutions. Create communication and safe dialogue is one of them.People may not be obliged to be stuck with their values, they can share opinions and become  more aware of what's surrounding them. Henry Fonda incarns with perfection this hope, his character tries to open dialogue and it actually works.This film shows the importance of being open minded and respectful of others, because as we can see in the film social interactions, especially when you are in a disagreement can easily become violent.

It shows us the important art of debating. The scenario is about a young boy who is accused to have killed his father, and 12 jurors who are supposed to decide if he is guilty or not. At first, only juror n°8 votes not guilty and then he succeeds thanks to the power of language to convince the others that they can’t send someone to the death. This film takes us in the United-States during the 1950’s with the Cold War context, and a lot of racism and xenophobia in the society. The different characters, played by famous and talented actors ( like Henry Fonda), show the variety of citizens at this time. We can also find a lot of interesting religious references. So, at first, I had mixed feelings about this old movie, but then, when I saw it, I found it really moving and important because it struggled against death penalty and it shows the power of words. 12 Angry Men is a masterpiece and Sydney Lumet is a genius!",

However, I usually don't watch a lot of movies from the 1950s like this one and I was surprised to see that the topics discussed in 12 angry men are still very relevant today.

So maybe it will help me to lead a debate in the future, and more usually to be sure of myself when I'll have to find a job, to convince people for something, because I would have learned some process, tips to speak easily.

Indeed, even if it was released more than sixty years ago it sounds very current and contemporary. Themes of racism, acceptance of the others and their differences, death penalty, to quote only these ones, are approached by the director, Sydney Lumet, in a very pertinent way : every juror represents one or more aspects of the society or human characteristics, faint or praiseworthy. For example, we can find in the character of the juror #6 a representation of quiet workers who think that they don’t deserve to express their opinions, we can see too in the juror #8 the illustration of the Platonic idea that the debates and considered discussions allow to find the truth or the best thing to do to find a solution to a problem. 12 angry men is very deep because of that, but also because of the many parallels made with the New Testament of the Bible (for example, the jurors are 12 like Jesus’ apostles) and well-made camera angles and movements, which reinforce the multiple feelings that the director conveys by way of his characters’ behavior and speeches. In short, I think it’s not too much to say that 12 angry men is a piece of art of chief importance ; it’s very successful, especially for a first movie.",
