Daigo decides to move back to his old hometown with his wife to look for work and start over. He answers a classified ad entitled “Departures” thinking it is an advertisement for a travel agency only to discover that the job is actually for a \"Nokanshi\" or \"encoffineer,\" a funeral professional who prepares deceased bodies for burial and entry into the next life. While his wife and others despise the job, Daigo takes a certain pride in his work and begins to perfect the art of “Nokanshi,” acting as a gentle gatekeeper between life and death, between the departed and the family of the departed. The film follows his profound and sometimes comical journey with death as he uncovers the wonder, joy and meaning of life and living. (Regent Releasing)\r… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The movie is uncommonly absorbing.",
    "Heart-warming, funny, wise and profound. Not to be missed.",
    "Beautiful moments abound. In Departures, the contemplation of death prepares the way for an appreciation of life.",
    "The film manages to be anything but dark; whimsy and sweet irony are laced throughout, a warmhearted blend that turned it into the surprise winner of 2008's Oscar for foreign-language film.",
    "On its own terms, Departures is a thing of rare and remarkable beauty.",
    "Though events unravel predictably, the film is profoundly affecting, thanks to a well-written story, rich characters and superlative acting.",
    "A surprisingly uplifting examination of life and loss.",
    "Yojiro Takita, who directed enduring commercial hits like \"The Ying Yang Master\" and \"The Yen Family,\" has made a popular gem -- thematically respectable, technically hard to fault, artfully scripted to entertain and touch.",
    "Departures is built for simplicity, and, if nothing else, the appeal to decency and integrity of this sweetly old-fashioned tale make it a must for Bernie Madoff's prison Netflix queue.",
    "It will absolutely delight the art-house crowd. Multiplexes will be crowded with noisy summer films, after all, from which Departures will represent a sophisticated and elegant departure.",
    "Gentle and comedically nuanced exercise in mourning.",
    "The film is far from perfect but has enough going on to compensate for its excessive length and some sentimentality.",
    "Yojiro Takita's movie simultaneously tickles tears of mourning as it wrings laughs about the meaning of life.",
    "The fascination, humor and poignancy of  Departures, this year's winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, rests in the Japanese ceremony of preparing bodies for their caskets.",
    "Sometimes macabre and sometimes manipulative, but the way it speaks to the spirit is miraculous.",
    "TV scribe Kundo Koyama's first bigscreen script peppers the proceedings with rich character detail and near-screwball interludes that shouldn't fit but somehow do.",
    "Director Yojiro Takita uses the changing seasons to echo the characters' moods; the score by Joe Hisaishi (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle) has a suitably majestic sweep.",
    "It is as polished as it is heavy-handed, and it leaves one under a spell.",
    "Departures is tender and, at times, rather squishy. It's sure to squeeze the tear ducts of anyone who has lost a parent.",
    "This is the kind of tastefully poignant drama that asks its audience to confront taboos and then pats them on the back for doing so.",
    "Departures is sappy and wacky – not the best combination.",
    "It will resonate with anyone who has ever buried a loved one and struggled to reconcile the myriad emotions--grief, anger, helplessness. Which is to say, everyone. And yet out of this premise comes glop. Departures needed a little more work in the morgue--like cutting to the bone.",
    "Overlong, predictable in its plotting and utterly banal in its blending of comic whimsy and melodramatic pathos.",
    "The acting is quite deft, if extremely broad, but screenwriter Kundo Koyama seesaws uncertainly between jokes and grief.",
    "Takita could easily trim 30 minutes of flab and oceans of tears from Departures. It still wouldn't merit an Oscar, but it would be a lot more watchable.",
    "Departures is, well … a nice film. It breaks no new ground, offers no audacious insights or rude revelations.",
    "Here's a great way to start savoring life: Don't waste it on pat manipulations like this."

My wife and I rate it 100% on the spot for bringing to light the importance of love, life, death, coming to our senses, forgiveness and respect for others, no matter what their persuasion. We are going back with relatives to watch it 4 more times, and can hardly wait for it to come out on DVD. The Italian film Life Is Beautiful and the Chinese film The Road Home left you with a feeling of the importance of life, relationships, family and love. Departures adds another perspective to these great films. Taken together, you come away a changed person. The film lingers in our minds and will not go away. It is so worth seeing - and multiple times.",

In a country which exalts youth and denies death, DEPARTURES must be a total drag for some viewers. I needn't tell the story, I'm concerned, but not surprised, that the American press gave this monumental film mixed reviews. In a country which exalts youth and denies death, DEPARTURES must be a total drag for some viewers. I needn't tell the story, because it is available in too many forms elsewhere. I will say that I've never seen a film from any filmmaker or culture which displays such reverence and love for the lives and deaths of common people as this extraordinarily beautiful movie. Perhaps it is the contrast between the Eastern way of death and that of our own which made such an impression on me. But on a simpler level, this film tells the story of a young man who -- having lost all identity -- recovers it in the most surprising way. He learns not only to adapt to his new occupation but to honor it. And his work -- casketing -- preparing bodies for cremation -- reveals the ultimate gestures of honor and respect for the dead. Deeply, deeply moving stuff. The venerable Joe Hisaihi has done it again. His cello-focused score is lavishly orchestrated and simply gorgeous. This is his best work since PRINCESS MONONOKE. The ensemble performances are as good as you get. There's not one false peep from the entire bunch. Any decent, intelligent filmgoer who misses this has bypassed more than a movie. The script, the imagery, the values of this great achievement will impact the sensibilities of those who see it. Our lives have more purpose than we, our acquaintances and employers suggest. We would all be better off if we could pay homage to others when they were still alive; but this wonderful work -- funny and moving in turn -- reminds us that we have another chance to do so, and that that it is redeeming and beautiful. Don't miss it.",

There were some lovely comic moments as well as some quite distressing scenes as the families go through all kinds of emotions as the say goodbye to their loved ones. I’ll admit to having found it quite touching at times and even shed a tear or two for my dear departed mum. Of course music plays quite a big part in the film and there are some really touching scenes as Daigo plays his cello out in the fields. I did find, however, that the final act didn’t quite have the emotional punch I had expected. Yes, the emotions were there, but it didn’t quite hit home the way I anticipated. Even so, it’s a film I really enjoyed and one I would happily watch again someday.\r SteelMonster’s verdict: RECOMMENDED\r My score: 8.2/10",

One side of it is very soft and touches our heart but on the other hand it is not as astonishing as we expect it to be. Story and even scenes are very predictable. Ending also could be seen from minutes away from it. Director has worked hard on the interior of Coffining but failed to bring deeper sentiments onto screen. Tsutomu Yamazaki's portrayal of a Boss who teaches the protagonist is the most fabulous quality of the movie. Actor actually work the role around and inside. Masahiro Motoki and Ryōko Hirosue are very convincing although camera sometime focused on Ryōko more then it needed. Her character as a devoted wife is well however it is not explored much. Ritual of coffining are filmed very good. The sub plot of protagonist's relation with his father was good but there could have been more about it. Over all a light hearted sentimental film.",
