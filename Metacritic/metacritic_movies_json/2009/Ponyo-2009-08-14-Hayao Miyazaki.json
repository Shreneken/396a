    "summary": "Ponyo is a story inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale \"The Little Mermaid.\" Already a box-office success in Japan, the story of a young and overeager goldfish named Ponyo and her quest to become human features an outstanding roster of voice talent. (Walt Disney Pictures)",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Don't tell Walt Disney, but Hayao Miyazaki really holds the keys to the magic kingdom.",
        "There is a word to describe Ponyo, and that word is magical. This poetic, visually breathtaking work by the greatest of all animators has such deep charm that adults and children will both be touched.",
        "It is a work of great fantasy and charm that will delight children ages 3 to 100.",
        "Best of all, Ponyo never ceases to be a genuine odyssey in short pants.",
        "It\u2019s essentially a stroll through a fantastically detailed pastel world, in which the plot is little more than an excuse for Miyazaki to dive into a world teeming with colorful (and sometimes prehistoric) life.",
        "You'll be planning to see Ponyo twice before you've finished seeing it once. Five minutes into this magical film you'll be making lists of the individuals of every age you can expose to the very special mixture of fantasy and folklore, adventure and affection.",
        "The latest masterwork from Hayao Miyazaki, places emphasis on the natural world, its tumults and fragility.",
        "One of Miyazaki's most kid-accessible movies, but still an unnerving film.",
        "A marvel.",
        "Though targeted at tots, Ponyo may appeal most to jaded adults thirsty for wondrous beauty and unpackaged innocence",
        "Imagination spills across the screen in a bold, undeniable presence.",
        "If the plot of Ponyo is small as a minnow, its themes--the relationship between parent and child, between the young and the elderly, between friends, between man and nature--are large and fully realized.",
        "Ponyo isn't Hayao Miyazaki's greatest film -- that would be a tall order in a 30-year feature career that includes the Oscar-winning \"Spirited Away\" -- but his beautiful, quirky fable has magic other children's movies can't touch.",
        "Traditional in the best sense.",
        "You watch a Miyazaki film with the pie-eyed, gape-mouthed awe of a child being read the most fantastic story and suddenly transported to places previously beyond the limits of imagination. It's quite a trip.",
        "Miyazaki creates fascinating, fluid and whimsical scenarios.",
        "This environmentally themed, very loose version of Hans Christian Andersen's \"Little Mermaid\" is never going to be mistaken for Disney's musical of the same name.",
        "Miyazaki works marvels. Sit back and behold.",
        "An entertaining and fascinating film.",
        "It's a movie for anyone who, like Miyazaki himself, can still happily commune with his inner five-year-old.",
        "Liam Neeson has gravely splendid pipes as Ponyo\u2019s father, a once-human wizard who lives underwater and despises humankind for polluting the planet.",
        "Ponyo is another conceptually and thrilingly original masterstroke from an animator who long ago left Walt Disney in the dust.",
        "A movie loaded with strange delights.",
        "Even by Miyazaki standards, Ponyo makes less narrative sense than it should, and the pat ending is a bit of a letdown.",
        "In short, it's very much a charming kids' film, created by a master of animation.",
        "My sense is that adults will be more taken with Ponyo than their offspring.",
        "Compared to \"My Neighbor Totoro\" and \"Kiki's Delivery Service,\" this is one of the anime master's weaker efforts.",
        "Trippy in the right way, and wholly enchanting.",
        "His (Miyazaki) stories, and often his character design, just leave me cold. I know I'm supposed to be magically transported by his fanciful tales and his whimsical grandiosity, but they make me listless."

Unbearably cute and sweet, but also deeply beautiful at times. And, interestingly enough, while watching this I stumbled upon some of the most subtle, unexpected and delightfully out-of-place humor that I've ever had the pleasure of encountering in all my years of watching movies. And that factor of surprise makes these slipped in little jokes all the more funny. I would even go so far as to say that there are some moments in Ponyo that are hilarious. Also, one thing I love about Hayao Miyazaki is that, no matter how unrealistic or fantastic his stories get, he never explains any of it. None of the fable-like creatures or enchanted play lands are rationalized or given credibility. They simply exist, and I find that wonderful. I'm glad that he approaches his animation that way, and I'm glad that he made no exception in Ponyo. It's kind. It's warm. And it is a treasure.",

Unfortunately, this was also the stage at which The Disney Company became more involved in Studio Ghibli. Sadly, nothing from Miyazaki has been the same ever since -- not the artistry, characterization, story-lines or philosophy. Luckily Joe Hisaishi still holds up his end with a brilliant score that falters only with the film's horrific end-title music. The song \"Ponyo\" might give a shark heartburn. PONYO is earnest and very pretty, but too predictable in its plot and too random in its attention to detail to satisfy this viewer. Great studios sometimes bring masterworks to Disney. Too often, today's Disney dumbs 'em down, as it did so well with its awful adaptation of clips from PLANET EARTH, titled only -- EARTH. To be fair, Miyazki has the right to craft a film exclusively for children, however, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO did just that --with artistry and reasonable sophistication. A mediocre film from a master makes one feel cheated, for it is the filmmaker who teaches and engages the audience. The market should never, ever drive= a great filmmaker's choices. Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened with PONYO.",

Do NOT go to this movie expecting another Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away! If you are going to see Ponyo, note that this film is firmly targeted to the pre-tween audience. I am an ardent fan of Miyazaki's work, but Ponyo is the weakest film of his that I have ever seen. Yes, the visuals are stunning, but the story lacks the depth we have come to expect from him. Even Miyazaki's earlier works that are mainly targeted towards children (such as My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service) easily best Ponyo in plot and character development. If Pixar has taught us anything, it is that you can have all the beauty and all the technology in the world thrown up on the screen, but in the end, it comes down to the power of the story that makes a film great. The overzealous voice acting by the American actors further tarnishes Ponyo. Before Miyazaki was \"discovered\" by Disney, the less star-powered cast of voice talents used in the US versions of his films did a much better job of avoiding too much verve in favor of subtlety and color. Miyazaki is truly one of the all-time great masters of animation. It is a terrible shame that Ponyo may be his final work.",

This is one of his more gentle fantasies like \"Kiki's Delivery Service\" or \"My Neighbor Tortoro\".  I enjoyed the political incorrectness throughout the film (the mother is a horrible driver, plus she leaves her 5 year old alone at home during a monster storm so she can drive to the senior center to check on their safety).  The real star of the film, however, is the fantastic drawings and color palettes.  This might be his most colorful movie he's made, and when you consider this is drawn and not computer generated some of the scenes are jaw dropping.  When you have a lot of fish in a single scene and each one is doing its own thing it must be a nightmare to animate.  Some of his movies can be a little preachy about the environment and balance of nature, but this one isn't too bad.  I do wish that animators would not use voices that are so distinctive.  Liam Neeson and Betty White have such distinctive voices that as soon as the character starts speaking, you immediately think of the actor.  I'm sure that was a Disney decision, plus actors want to voice in a Miyazaki film much like actors want to be in a Woody Allen Film because they recognize greatness.

Probably more beloved by critics and animation experts, Ponyo only wows you if you have a taste for efforts pushing the boundary of narrative in ways only animation can.  Standout features for me:- A rare positive and explicit evocation of the Divine Feminine in Ponyo's mother,- A fluid childlike art style perfectly suited to animating hundreds of watery scenes,- The creepiness of a fairy enticed to become human thru human blood is neither ignored nor exploited,- The supporting nursing home characters evolve suprisingly. Adroit in multiple ways Ponyo is an animated wonder. Ponyo (also known as Ponyo on the Cliff) (2008) (almost unique portrayals of the Divine Feminine on film. Look for it at your library)",

Nobody wants to dissect this Vivian siren. That's the cliche of most The government isn't after the fish. This almost Henry Darger-like mermaid(because all the fish are curiously female) poses no threat to national security. Nobody wants to dissect this Vivian siren. That's the cliche of most American movies whenever there's a non-human creature on the loose. For instance, Ron Howard's \"Splash\", in which authorities track down the otherworldly entity with the intent to kill. \"Ponyo\" gets around this banality by making the mermaid's pursuer a benevolent one. As a result, the film is lacking in suspense, which may put off a western audience, largely used to shopworn tropes such as FBI agents in black coats and shades, and a chase of some sort. Starting with the mother, the incongruous sight of a fish equipped with a human girl's face, never alarms like it would, or should, in most filmic cases. If the fish-face did, Ponyo's notoriety would eventually get the law's attention with predictable results. Sophisticated as all Pixar films are, the collected works of this filmmaker truly diverges from animation's preordained roots as strictly a children's genre. \"Ponyo\" distinguishes itself through its naturalistic domestic scenes, which are virtually indistinguishable from the human interaction you'd find in a live-action film. A good deal of time is spent on establishing the relationships within a family unit, which may some find boring, as the mother tends to her son and his new playmate with great deliberation. The bar is raised, quietly, as these seemingly uneventful moments that establish character are more exciting than the gorgeous depictions of the girl's underwater world, and the subsequent hurricane above, because such lifelike simulacrum helps make the case for animation as being the equal of your so-called \"serious\" films. (NOTE: Dubbing is a necessary evil to attract larger audiences, but some of the dialogue, notably towards the end, is truly hideous.)",

I would say it is aimed at 7-8 year olds, where as Spirited Away or Howl's Moving Castle were probably more suitable for 12-15 year olds. But, as might be expected from this stellar animation genius, some of the sequences are still absolutely magical in the atmosphere they invoke. The storm sequence where Ponyo rides the waves, and the underwater sequences generally are as good as anything you will see. And the supporting characters in the old folk's home are beautifully realised, and there is a lot of emotional resonance and family sentiment. But it is nevertheless pretty slow, with a simple story, and it is primarily designed to be cute and engaging for little kids. So all credit to Miyazaki, who hasn't fallen into the Pixar/Dreamworks/Disney trap of continually ramping up the scale and graphics and humour to capture every demographic and maximise the financial returns. Definitely worth seeing, but a gentle delight, rather than a blockbuster. Little kids will still be loving this movie in 50 years, long after most of the contemprary cartoons have faded away.",

If they can, then you are a monster because you forced it down thier throats just because you like Miyazaki. All joking aside, this movie is weaker because it doesn't appeal as well to the same group who loved all of Miyazaki's other films (aside from 1% of whom are mouth breathing conformists, who would lick Miyazaki's boots, and say it tastes like a pbj sandwich, who if they have children, are currently trying to contact me for a dollar) and it also doesn't appeal to anyone new very well either.

Visual effects weren't as stunning as Spirited Away or Howl's Moving Castle, especially the opening scenes, in which I felt the jellyfish weren't detailed anough and looked flat. However, a nice and fun enough movie for the family, and will at least leave you feeling good. Funny enough at places, and I guess if you love Miyazaki to bits (like me), you should watch this movie just for the sake of it.",

The movie is a visual wonder, dancing in colors and beautiful artwork that belongs in an art museum. Hayao Miyazaki has truely done it again in this true wonder. The films only shortcoming is the length of some of its scenes. It seems a tad stretched out at moments, but the films childlike charms, beautiful artistry, and lighthearted but surprisingly deep and heartfelt plot make that easy to ignore.

Ponyo was very magical and charming. I did feel though the ending could have had a little more to it, I am not sure whether I'd use the word incomplete but it didn't leave me completely satisfied. Small criticism aside, the animation is exquisite, typical Miyazaki really- Ethereal colours, beautiful backgrounds and interesting character designs make up the animation here. Another delight was the music, melodious, memorable and of sheer beauty. The script is good too, and I also loved the simple yet magical story and the charming characters especially the very sweet protagonist. The voice acting is top notch too, it is quite emotive and never feels bland. In conclusion, really quite charming and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Beautiful animation, as can always expect from Miyazaki. Didn\u2019t get very far into the story. It was very quiet and the sounds indicating motion and emotion were captivating. I rewatched it a year or two later and really enjoyed the story and character development.This was one of those films you\u2019d told me we\u2019d watch, but it took us a while to get to. It was also one of the ones that you found on a night I had other plans. It was the only night of the week I was going to see my own friends, and then you texted and said you\u2019d found the movie and I should come over. When I said I had plans, you got aggressive but more quickly depressed\u2014I didn\u2019t have much choice. I cancelled my plans with my friends and came over to your place. You told me to put on pajamas and get in bed, and I did. I fell asleep a quarter of the way through the movie.\tMovie Rating: 7/10\tViewing Experience: 4/10",
