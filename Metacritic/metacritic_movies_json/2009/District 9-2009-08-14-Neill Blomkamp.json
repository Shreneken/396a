Humans waited for the hostile attack, or the giant advances in technology. Neither came. Instead, the aliens were refugees, the last survivors of their home world. The creatures were set up in a makeshift home in South Africa’s District 9 as the world’s nations argued over what to do with them. Now, patience over the alien situation has run out. The tension between the aliens and the humans comes to a head when a human field operative, Wikus van der Merwe, contracts a mysterious virus that begins changing his DNA. Wikus quickly becomes the most hunted man in the world, as well as the most valuable – he is the key to unlocking the secrets of alien technology. Ostracized and friendless, there is only one place left for him to hide: District 9. [Sony Pictures]… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Every now and then, a film comes along that both defies and compels description. District 9 is one such movie: a science-fiction action vehicle so brilliantly and fully imagined that real life, when it resumes after the credits, arrives with a new sense of dread.",
    "A sci-fi-fueled indictment of man's inhumanity to man -- and the non-human -- District 9 is all horribly familiar, and transfixing.",
    "To his credit, however, the often-playful Blomkamp never bludgeons his audience with any specific message. He's too busy letting 'er rip with his edge-of-your-seat, and unapologetically violent, sci-fi adventure.",
    "No true fan of science fiction -- or, for that matter, cinema -- can help but thrill to the action, high stakes and suspense built around a very original chase movie.",
    "The humanity of District 9 adds another dimension to this multilayered, rewarding work -- one of the best of the summer, and undoubtedly the most inventive from the multiplex this year.",
    "Madly original, cheekily political, altogether exciting District 9.",
    "District 9 is very smart sci-fi, but that's just the beginning; it's also a scathing social satire hidden inside a terrific action thriller teeming with gross aliens and regrettable inter-species conflict. And it's a blast. . . .",
    "District 9 proves that genre films, besides being a hell of a lot of fun, can say things you hadn't considered and show stuff you haven't seen.",
    "This is a delicious premise, and Blomkamp, who first played with it in a 2005 short called \"Alive in Joburg,\" has magnified and improved it with ferocious energy, wit and style.",
    "Grabs you by the eyeballs from the very first frame.",
    "Though compelling throughout, District 9 never becomes outright terrifying, largely because Blomkamp is less interested in exploiting his aliens for cheap scares than in holding up a mirror to our own bloodthirsty, xenophobic species.",
    "District 9 whizzes by with a resourcefulness and mordant wit nearly worthy of its obvious influences: \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\" \"Dawn of the Dead,\" and \"Starship Troopers.\"",
    "Blomkamp and his entire cast and crew have created an instant genre classic that transcends the self-limiting ghetto implied by the term \"science fiction\" and instead, like precursors such as Robert Wise's \"The Day the Earth Stood Still,\" engages not only the mind but the heart as well. It's magnificent.",
    "A great-looking and smart film. It has enough action, wonder, depth, and action to keep any fan of the genre happy. The sociological undertones here are fascinating as well.",
    "The reason District 9 reverberates so loudly is because its moral indignation is cranked to 11.",
    "Anyone who watches District 9 and doesn't think of Apartheid, Nazis, and Josef Mengele needs to spend some time reading a few history books.",
    "South African director Neill Blomkamp set and shot the film around his native Johannesburg, so parallels to apartheid leap to mind. Yet the script he wrote with Terri Tatchell applies to any culture that bluntly excludes another.",
    "Attention all geeks (and geeks at heart): Get ready for two hours of serious awesome.",
    "This baby has the stuff to end the movie summer on a note of dazzle and distinction.",
    "With its clever faux documentary style, this is the most imaginative science-fiction movie to come along in years.",
    "The ad campaign for the sci-fi thriller District 9, with mysterious billboards touting aliens among us, is highly creative and amusing. So, in patches, is the movie, which is a thinking man's, or man-boy's, \"Transformers.\"",
    "District 9 fuses science fiction mayhem and biting social commentary as well as any film since \"Starship Troopers.\" It’s the rare alien invasion story that has the aliens running scared.",
    "A memorable, monstrous fable that's consistently gripping.",
    "Blomkamp’s prawn cocktail has more than enough stylistic chutzpah and originality to make District 9 an essential date.",
    "In the best B-movie tradition, the filmmakers embed their ideas in an ingenious, propulsive and suspenseful genre entertainment, one that respects your intelligence even as it makes your eyes pop (and, once in a while, your stomach turn).",
    "Despite its creativity, the movie remains space opera and avoids the higher realms of science-fiction.",
    "The last time I felt the sort of outrageously kinetic action-movie high District 9 delivers, it was 1981 and George Miller, Mel Gibson, and \"Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior\" had just come roaring out of Australia.",
    "Some movies pack such a terrific central idea, even their flaws can’t stop the train. District 9 is one of them.",
    "There is a lot of shield-your-eyes ickiness in District 9, a lot of violence and gore. What there is not a lot of, however, is humanity - even in the film's depiction of the inhumanity humans are capable of.",
    "As an allegory of racial conflict and mass immigration, District 9 never really goes anywhere: The appealing premise fades into the background before 20 minutes have elapsed.",
    "Unfortunately, as in many such big-screen comic books, the backstory beats the hell out of the present-tense plot.",
    "The movie falls into the same uneasy category as \"Eight Legged Freaks\": too tongue-in-cheek to be thrilling, not funny enough to be a comedy.",
    "It's a bad joke that District 9 will be hailed for its \"originality.\"",
    "Yes, the premise is delightful; no, the delight doesn't last.",
    "There's a wonderfully sly, farcical verve to these early moments, but it dissipates when the script, with its strains of \"E.T.\" and \"The Fly,\" moves into high sci-fi gear."

The so-called \"allegorical social commentary\" was so blatant and poorly done that a 3 year old could have got it. The acting appeared to be off-the-cuff, with f**k thrown in whenever the script faltered, the attempt at amateur doco film making was so bad that it was worse than most amateur docos (and left us both feeling nauseous with the jumping swaying camera angles). The humor was there, sure, but it wasn't worth more than a slight smile to think, for instance, of aliens being addicted to cat food (including the can). The humor was neither subtle nor very funny. The action scenes were typical of all action movies, and the special effects were not anything new in this age of digital special effects offerings. The plot was incohesive and pretty much pointless with zero character development.

The inconsistency of the aliens' abilities, or lack thereof, was frustrating. The only character that was not a cardboard cut-out was the lead, and even he was border-line unsympathetic because he was such an obvious moron. The main mercenary was somehow unkillable, and therefore highly distracting as the film went to such pains to paint a \"real\" picture. And I agree that the film is not very original. Throughout D9 I could not stop thinking about how much better Cronenberg's The Fly and Spielberg's E.T. are, as narratives and cinema. Ultimately, this is another film, in an unfortunately growing number of films, that is not cinema, but rather feature length CGI exercise.

I was really hyped up for this flick, because it felt like it was being made by really creative, really intellectual people who were going to present an allegory in a really new and fresh way. All the promotional material was top-notch, and I spent hours at the website exploring and learning about the premise and the back-story, and just kind of absorbing the whole thing. I showed up at the theatre expecting to be genuinely challenged mentally and maybe even morally, and instead, it was just a popcorn flick. If my expectations hadn't been jacked up so high, I probably could've enjoyed the movie, but it just wasn't what I was hoping for. District 9 was our last chance to rescue 2009 from a summer that included Transformers 2, G.I. Joe, and literally the most boring Harry Potter movie I've ever sat through, which is saying something. Instead, the characters were one-dimensional; the plot ended with the premise, and the ending was a WTF? moment for the ages. The violence wound up being pretty good, but in my head, I was screaming at the good guys, \"WHY AREN'T YOU KILLING THEM!?\" and at the bad guys, \"WHY AREN'T YOU RUNNING AWAY?!\" The special effects and the general presentation were superbly done and visually stunning, but unfortunately, that's where the creativity stopped. Also, I think that if you lived through the 80's, you pretty much got the Apartheid metaphor directly from the trailers. You can almost go into the movie and take it as given. Instead, you sit there and get hammered over the head with it for an hour and a half. It just made me cringe after awhile. And at the same time, it's the elephant in the room. At a certain point, I was waiting for someone, anyone to stand up and say, \"Hey! Remember that one time in South Africa when we used to pretend like blacks weren't real people? This is JUST LIKE THAT. 'Cept with aliens.\" I guess I just found the whole thing insulting, intellectually, which is the exact opposite of what I was expecting, which is why I was so disappointed. And I'm even more disappointed with moviegoers for not calling the moviemakers out on it. Instead, everybody's fawning all over it, hailing it as unique and original and smart, of all things.

Third Why is there a super high tech ship with aliens that are dumber as dumb as a pack of wild dog and acted as such. even if they were just workers and they had a superior race then why would they give them a ship and deadly guns. Forth how did they become stranded when the only thing keeping the ship from leaving was the fact on one was on it. i mean why would he detach that control room from the bigger ship stranding them there. I just think this story line was just haphazardly thrown together for a quick buck after they canceled HALO and based on this movie im am elated Peter Jackson and the other guy did not make HALO they would have messed it up beyond belief Because when it does come out it will be about the prequel book by Eric Nylund like it always should have been.",

The film was not intelligent, insightful, or interesting. The oh-so original message that the pseudo-intellectuals are harping about is the same one we've seen a thousand times: \"Humans are more monstrous than the monsters.\" Are you surprised? Can you wrap your head around that? How about if I repeat myself again... and again? Didn't Peter Jackson already make a movie about this? (King Kong) *Spoiler Alert* Lastly, nothing made sense. Why come to Earth? Why be addicted to cat food? Why be abused by humans if you have crazy-powerful alien weapons and super strength? Why do the humans and aliens understand each others' language? Why not converse in the same language? It takes an alien 20 years to radio the mothership directly overhead to beam him up? Once in the mothership, why fly away? To get help? You could have done that 20 years ago - ya know, instead of landing here and stranding your fellow aliens in a hell-hole. If someone is shooting you - with bullets - from a gun - and you're dying... why not shoot back!? I've saved the best for last: Why does a splash of alien fuel mutate a person into an alien? .Ask yourself that question one more time... then splash yourself with gasoline.

It was stupid. No, really, I get it. I got it. Yes, apartheid, yeah, segregation, yeah humanity is evil and the aliens are the good guys.

So let's clarify what exactly there is to 'get' from this film. 1) Crazily good CGI 2) One good scene of things being blown to pieces, which is kind of just CGI, too. 3) Oh, and, it's a film about discrimination, yeah, like, set in South Africa, which is ironic, isn't it, because it's, like, a really discriminatory place, and stuff, and they're doing the same here only with aliens, which makes it a satire, apparently. nothing else. really. and that third point about its being a satire/allegory was sarcastic (the film goes about as far as to say \"look, the aliens are being discriminated against, like black people\", before then throwing in a bunch of wildly stereotypical, cocaine-addled black characters.) and..the second point was kind of the same as the first.. so essentially there was only one thing to 'get' in this film - that someone's really good with CGI, and should probably be using their talents to make better movies.

Cause i think it would have been a lot easier to just look for it while they were on the ship. Second off there were many things in the movie that was not explained why could the understand each other so well but neither side could speak a single word of the others language. Third Why is there a super high tech ship with aliens that are dumber as dumb as a pack of wild dog and acted as such. even if they were just workers and they had a superior race then why would they give them a ship and deadly guns. Forth how did they become stranded when the only thing keeping the ship from leaving was the fact on one was on it. i mean why would he detach that control room from the bigger ship stranding them there.

It's like seeing Alien with the good guys being crewed by Dunder Mifflin. The lead \"human\" actor comes across as blissfully unaware of anything, and the filming with hand held cameras with graphic gore really does not go well with popcorn.

It has a great plot that makes you think about humanity and what would happen if we were really to encounter Aliens.

E.g., why have the aliens not rebelled in 20 years despite the fact that they have advanced weaponry? Why does the head of the multinational corporation place his son-in-law, a total doofus, in charge of the relocation (and what was the purpose of the relocation anyway)? And would the father-in-law really be so evil that he doesn't stop the grotesque medical experiments on his son-in-law? How come the prawns mysteriously vanish from District 9 only to resurface abruptly at the end? And why are the humans so incredibly stupid and gullible about the corporation's true intentions? Also, why does the film adopt a mockumentary format but repeatedly shift to a more cinematic tone? How do the aliens and the humans communicate, anyway? I could go on, but it was these and other problems that prevented me from taking the film's \"message\" seriously (well, that and that not-quite-convincing CGI, which makes the aliens seems slightly cartoonish). Suffice it to say, it's actually something of a relief when the film becomes another stupid action movie in the final act, if only because the movie drops any pretense of being a deep and profound meditation on prejudice and economic inequality. As an audience, you really just want to see heads explode, which the movie delivers in spades.
