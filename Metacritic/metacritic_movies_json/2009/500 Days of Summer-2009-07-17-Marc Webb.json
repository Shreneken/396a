  "summary": "This is a story of boy meets girl, begins the wry, probing narrator of 500 Days of Summer, and with that the film takes off at breakneck speed into a funny, true to life and unique dissection of the unruly and unpredictable year-and-a-half of one young man’s no-holds-barred love affair.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "You're going to hear a lot about 500 Days of Summer over the next few months. All of the good stuff is true. Any bad stuff you hear is not.",
    "It's a feat of star acting, and it helps make (500) Days not just bitter or sweet but everything in between.",
    "Here is a rare movie that begins by telling us how it will end and is about how the hero has no idea why.",
    "Much like the actual summer (the season, not the character), we never wanted it to end.",
    "Visually witty, flawlessly played romantic comedy.",
    "Something seldom seen: an original romantic comedy.",
    "The casting is perfect. Webb has chosen leads who are familiar but not overexposed, and who are on equal footing (neither overshadows the other).",
    "A different kind of love story: an honest one that takes a piece out of you.",
    "Much like Annie Hall did for a previous generation, (500) Days of Summer may be the movie that best captures a contemporary romantic sensibility.",
    "This is a romantic comedy that makes the concept of romantic comedies appealing again -- that reminds you how resonant and transporting they can be when they're done right.",
    "You know how people say that they don't make romantic comedies like they used to? Turns out they do.  At least, director Marc Webb does -- and has -- with his clever and sweet debut, 500 Days of Summer.",
    "A movie that will be discovered, embraced and shared with friends like a favorite record album.",
    "The film does a lovely job of balancing emotional clarity, formal trickery, pop sweetness, and heartfelt narrative. It is, yes, cute, and it is, yes, quirky. And it is entirely justified, estimable and loveable in being those things.",
    "The writing is often clever and the overall production playful and intelligent.",
    "The film is, finally, a brilliant tap dance over a void: There’s no real drama when the inner life of the female lead is so shrouded, even if that’s the point.",
    "Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel charm the pants off us -- and each other! -- in this irresistible comedy.",
    "A romantic comedy that feels like real life.",
    "Perfectly played, simultaneously serious and light, endlessly inventive, this is a strong contender for the most original date movie of the year. (Terrific) stuff.",
    "A funny, seductive, and surprisingly honest dramatization of the ways we snooker ourselves into incompatible love.",
    "Deschanel does what she does seemingly without effort, managing to convey Summer's mixed-up messed-upness.",
    "The film has an easygoing, inquisitive spirit, heightened by Webb's visual conceits",
    "It's an \"Annie Hall\" for the iPod generation: über-designed, pleasing to the touch, making up in generic sweetness what it lacks in bite.",
    "An irresistible feel-good movie about love gone bad.",
    "It's the oldest bittersweet story in the book, of course, but music-video director Marc Webb approaches his feature debut with great confidence, flair and a minimum of schmaltz.",
    "The whole movie aspires to set an Annie Hall vibe, especially when Tom keeps trying to re-create, first with her and then with someone else.",
    "Boy gets girl and boy loses girl in convoluted, sometimes cloying but ultimately winning fashion in 500 Days of Summer.",
    "It's more like a love story in a blender. What is unexpected is the sincerity beneath the modest conceit that, yup, love hurts.",
    "Slight, charming and refreshingly candid little picture.",
    "It's fun both to watch and to talk about afterward, and it possesses the elusive rom-com sine qua non: two equally appealing leads who bounce wonderfully off each other.",
    "And what makes this autopsy of a love affair funny is Tom's ironic, morose commentary as he revisits what happened.",
    "Because the emotional drama is so one-sided, I just can't love you.",
    "It goes down smoothly, thanks in large part to Joseph Gordon-Levitt's grounded lead performance and Marc Webb's slick direction, but it seems like every other scene coughs up a dispiriting cliché.",
    "Because we know almost from the get-go that things will turn out bad-to-bittersweet for them, the movie is like one long autopsy of what went wrong, starting with Day No. 488.",
    "Ultimately, the best thing about (500) Days of Summer isn't its gimmicky script. It's the constant performance of Gordon-Levitt, who shifts, scene-by-scene, from moments of ebullience to abject dejection.",
    "For all its rhetorical whimsy and hipster dressings, (500) Days of Summer is a thoroughly conservative affair, as culturally and romantically status quo as any Jennifer Aniston vehicle.",
    "An exhaustive and exhausting dissection of a relationship that was never all that promising in the first place."

As to the comedy; this picture is more about drama, which means that the goal is to make the viewer identify with the situation.As this is not a happy ending story, the movie tries to show how foolish we become when being blindly in love; in other words this film makes a satire of love. According to the picture a person in this situation will forgive everything, will remember all the happy moments but not the sad ones and wont listen any warning.The ending is remarkable because both lovers end up believing what the other thought about life in the beginning of the relationship; Tom stopped believing in destiny, happy endings and fairy tale stories; and Summer stopped believing in coincidences, a existence without love and with no possibility of dreaming.500 Days of Summer has an interesting plot, script and performances, but I think that the one of Zooey Deschanel is more suitable for the movie than the one of Joseph Gordon Levitt.

Perhaps, but I am grading the movie in light of the films that it aspires to be like. Actually, aspires is the wrong word. \"Marketed\" would be more appropriate. The film really has no aspirations other than to portray itself as a hip indie romantic comedy that will rope in those susceptible to fawning over anything that references The Smiths, \"The Graduate,\" etc., has a cool indie rock score, has a jaded central character, and contains the insipid indie darling, Zooey Deschanel. There is absolutely nothing new here, and the material that is recycled (I don't think there is anything wrong with retreading tride and true formulas) is done so badly. The venture doesn't even come close to a movie like, \"He's just not that into you,\" which is no classic. But this is no surprise, since the demographic \"500\" aims for want to indulge in the idea of \"indie\" while remaining entirely \"de-pendant\" on the opinions of their peers. People in their twenties and thirties have other concerns, and want to be entertained... at least somewhat.",

Unfortunately, the script writer appears to have not spend enough time researching social philosophy on that topic (f.i. writings of Erich Fromm). Thereafter, the movie misses to make a clear distinction between infatuation and real love/earnest friendship. Furthermore, it completely leaves out the possibility that two people really just might have to work together and have some tolerance for each others flaws. Rather \"(500) Days of Summer\" suggests that love is something totally random and that a relationship either works perfectly or simply not. Because of this, the \"(500) Days of Summer\" contributes to keeping alive the fairy tale idea that there is one - and only one - perfect lover in the world for each single person. Nevertheless, the movie does a good job on one of its other goals, which is to encourage the viewer to not follow the trend of striving for quick money, but to follow one's real passion by bringing it to the center of one's life. Lastly, \"(500) Days of Summer\" is good filmmaking, tastefully combining romance, drama, and short scenes amplifying emotions of the protagonists like a funny musical interlude or beautiful 2-D animation.",

I saw it three times through the Fox Searchlight Advance Screening program, and I still plan to see it a fourth time. I'm calling it now: with the expanded slots at the Oscars and Comedy section in the Golden Globes: don't be surprised if this is the little indie that squares off with all the traditional November films like Nine and Shutter Island.

In some ways it's more about growing up than it is about love. In other ways it's more about how we perceive reality than it is about love or growing up. In other ways it's more about the indefatigable spirit of life and about not ever really growing up but about how one season just flows into the next in a wonderful cycle driven, as Dante pointed out, by the power of love. So in the end, it really is a love story. The story in this film is told in non-chronological order. The structure is more like the structure of memory. In our consciousness, memories from different past time periods pop up next to one another without chronological ordering. Yet despite it being told as a series of memories, the end of the film is more difficult to predict than your typical romantic comedy. The non-chronological story line is only one way that 500 Days of Summer presents life in subjective terms. Our emotions often color our perceptions. In this film, the story is colored by the main character's emotions. When he is happy, he remembers happy things and perceives happiness around him. If you watch the film closely, you will even how the movies tend to mold his perceptions.

Catch it when it runs on cable on a rainy day. It's not worth forking out the money to see in the theater.",

Her performance in her last five movies have been good . . . after an earlier spotty track record. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's work has been fairly consistently strong since leaving sitcom TV. The two 28 year olds are perfectly cast in (500) Days Of Summer. The interaction of their relationship, cleverly written, rang true. In fact I would say it was probably universally true. I bet every one can identify with one or another or both. They seemed so right for each other . . . not to mention both being super cute. But . . . Well. we are warned very early in the film that this is not going to be a successful love story. So I wasn't expecting a \"they live happily ever after\" kind of ending. But the ending, which evoked laughter and applause from the small audience - it was a 10:30 a.m. showing, was most satisfying.",
