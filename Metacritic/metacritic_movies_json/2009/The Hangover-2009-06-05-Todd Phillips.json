But when the three groomsmen wake up the next morning with pounding headaches, they can't remember a thing. Their posh hotel suite is beyond trashed and the groom is nowhere to be found. With no clue of what happened and little time to spare, the trio must attempt to retrace their bad decisions from the night before in order to figure out where things went wrong and hopefully get Doug back to L.A. in time for his wedding. However, the more they begin to uncover, the more they realize just how much trouble they're really in. (Warner Bros.)\u2026 Expand",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "This is a movie where you WANT to stick around for the credits. The beauty is that you are totally set up for it, and you don't mind one bit. That final sequence ties the movie together in an awesome fashion.",
        "A piercingly funny, twisted \"whatever-happens-in-Vegas\" caper.",
        "At once raucously free-wheeling and meticulously contrived, picture satisfies as a boys-gone-wild laff riot that also clicks as a seriocomic beat-the-clock detective story.",
        "The Hangover is a shaggy-dog tale that's actually, when you step back from it, perfectly shaped.",
        "Todd Phillips is no artist, but his lowbrow comedies (Road Trip, Old School) always hit the mark because they're so psychologically true: the superego tries to control the id, but the id gets drunk and barfs all over it. Hilarious.",
        "A funny movie, flat out, all the way through. Its setup is funny. Every situation is funny. Most of the dialogue is funny almost line by line.",
        "The Hangover ain't art, but Phillips has shaped the hardcore hilarity into the summer party movie of all our twisted dreams.",
        "So if you're looking for the next stop on the Shockingly Experimental Comedy train, don't get off here -- this ride is strictly for laughs.",
        "There is a sort of perverse brilliance or brilliant perverseness to be found in this story of a bachelor party gone terribly wrong.",
        "A furiously paced, inventive and flat-out hilarious take on a tried-and-tested formula. An exemplary bromantic comedy that doesn't sacrifice heart in pursuit of laughs, maintaining plenty of the former and a superabundance of the latter.",
        "The Hangover instantly has the feel of one for the ages.",
        "Overall it's more amusing than hilarious.",
        "The Hangover remains unrepentantly irresponsible and hilarious throughout, culminating with what could be the funniest montage ever to grace a picture's end credits. The summer's first sleeper hit has arrived.",
        "It's a worst-case-scenario of bachelor party morning-after, and it is howlingly funny.",
        "Director Todd Phillips (Old School) has a knack for extreme scenarios and outside-the-box casting. He has made a movie that is consistently funny from start to finish.",
        "The Hangover pushes the boundaries of good taste, good sense, and good will toward man. And you'll feel good about it all.",
        "A lot of what happens is gross, puerile and gratuitous, granted, but Helms and Galifianakis are truly funny in offbeat fashion, and the script allows Phillips room for some brilliant slapstick. You will not be ennobled. But you will be entertained.",
        "The funniest movie so far this year.",
        "Raunchy frat comedies are as hard to pull off as any other kind because they have to keep surprising the audience, and The Hangover does with a bizarre series of uproarious situations with explanations that just about stay within the bounds of plausibility.",
        "For a viewer in the mood for something rude, crude, and lewd, it would be difficult to find a more satisfying food.",
        "It is classless, it is tasteless, it is idiotic, it is juvenile and it is something your mother totally wouldn't approve of. But it also is flat-out hilarious, a go-for-broke comedy that not only is the best laugher released so far this summer, but one of the best so far this year.",
        "Phillips can't bring himself to push the material into truly outr\u00e9 territory, or to characterize his growth-impaired guys as degenerate creeps rather than lovable scamps.",
        "But true to its title, The Hangover goes down smoothly enough and then kicks you in the head later on, when you start to examine the sources of your laughter.",
        "This kind of \"one crazy night\" tale relies on drum-tight structure to work. Without it, The Hangover sputters to a sentimental halt. Still, it's worth staying for the closing credits.",
        "Sitting through The Hangover is like watching \"Memento\" featuring the Three Stooges.",
        "It doesn't disappoint. It gets the job done thanks in large part to the breakout performance given by Galifianakis. It's no \"Old School,\" but it will do nicely until that film's anticipated sequel rolls around in 2011.",
        "It's an agreeably unambitious comedy that might be called a romp, if that word didn't imply a little too much energy.",
        "Even Galifianakis's pervy charm, and a deeply weird cameo by Mike Tyson, can't save The Hangover. Whatever the other critics say, this is a bromance so primitive it's practically Bro-Magnon.",
        "Rude, lewd and occasionally in the nude, The Hangover brings a collection of fresh faces to the familiar raucous male-bonding comedy.",
        "Amusing as it is, it never feels real.",
        "The Hangover is like an infernal comedy machine. Surrender your soul to its foul mesh of cheap cleverness and vulgarity. and you howl like a delighted demon. Resist, and you feel all sense and sensibility being crushed in its cogs."

Road Trip, Old Scool, Starsky & Hutch, and the upcoming Due Date starring Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis. I didn't care for most of the previous titles, except Old School. It took me a long time to see Old School, but when I did I was thoroughly satisfied. It wasn's the movie itself that I fell in love with, as much as the genuine feeling of comradery and friendship between Mitch (Luke Wilson), Frank the Tank (Will Ferrell) and Beanie (Vince Vaughn). That is the very same feeling I get when I watch The Hangover. The actors all have a chemistry that makes you believe what's happening to them, no matter how outrageous it is. Zach Galifiankis was the best. What a great way to break onto the movie scene, after a decade of extra roles, and tv spots. The slogan, \"Some guys just can't handle Vegas\" is perfect. Without saying, if you saw the trailer you alreay know that the premise of the story is a bit extreme, but I never got the feeling that events from the film were beyond the realm of reality. Another great thing about this movie was the cameos. I'm always a sucker for good cameos, and The Hangover doesn't disappoint. I loved the appearances of Ken Jeong as the gay Chinese gangster Mr. Chow, Rob Riggle as the over-caffinated cop, and Mike Epps as black Doug. Oh yeah, and that other Mike too. Although, they probally shouldn't have spoiled that one in the preview. With so much going on in the story, this film could have easily had a few unfilled plot holes, but I'm happy to say that it didn't. The only question that went unanswered was how that chicken got in the hotel room. The Hangover was one of my favorite films of the summer. That's saying alot because there were quite a few great movies that came out in the summer of 2009. Todd Phillips may use the same basic buddy comedy palette for each of his movies, but why shouldn't he? It works. I can't wait for Due Date. And if theres any truth to this, we should be expecting a sequal to The Hangover. My fingers are crossed for that one.",

With all the adult content I sometimes wonder whether I can handle an R rated movie. Up until today the only really good R rated movie I saw was Super Bad. However, the Hangover knocks that movie out of the ballpark. The plot of the film is essential these four guys have decided to have a bachelor party in Vegas. So they go out and have a good time. Come next morning though the bachelor is nowhere to be found and three guys can't remember anything from the night before. So begins their hilarious quest to find Doug, the bachelor. Most of the humor in this movie revolves around these guys finding out what it was they did the other night. Without giving anything away all I'm going to say is that these guys did some serious s-word. The core of this comedy is these guys finding out what they did through the consequences of their actions. Throughout a good portion of that part of the film I was laughing my head off. However, the jokes began to dry out after the trunk incident. Nonetheless when this water is boiling it makes the kettle whistle. For any parents reading this let me assure that the Hangover isn't the most adult movie in the world. Most of the R rated content comes in the form of the language used. In fact there was nothing really that disturbing in this movie. Nonetheless, this movie is still for the more mature audience. The Hangover is the comedy. It will make you laugh so hard that you'll either throw your head back clap your hands, or both. However, the humor fails to endure for the entire film . Nonetheless, the movie is hilarious long enough for me to give it an 85/100. However, since Metacritic doesn't do decimals I'm stuck giving my secondary opinion. Bottom line go watch this movie for what it's worth, this movie is a freaking good time.",
