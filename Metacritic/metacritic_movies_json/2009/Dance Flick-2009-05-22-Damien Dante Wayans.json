  "critic_reviews": [
    "Enjoyably dirty-minded sendup of when-ballet-met-hip-hop youth musicals.",
    "Its belly laughs leave you feeling liberated and not guilty; I repeat, not guilty.",
    "The Wayans brothers manage to squeeze it all in to consistently amusing effect and in a way that just barely manages to stay within those PG-13 parameters.",
    "The more pertinent question: Can the audience stick with this flick that showed most of its funny bits in the trailer? For the most part, yeah.",
    "The miss-and-hit parodies score best when focusing on the Julia Stiles-styled girl next door.",
    "Dance Flick occasionally hits its mark with nimble execution. But too often it stumbles clumsily into bad taste.",
    "An entertaining, moderately irreverent comedy that launches the silly movie season on a sure foot.",
    "The best bits in this film fall short of being inspired, but they are outrageous.",
    "It would be hard to imagine a film with less going for it than Dance Flick.",
    "A decent enough spot of silliness.",
    "The gags themselves only marginally work when they stick to silly non sequitur; the random movie references are forced and flat, and the takeoffs of \"Dreamgirls\" and \"Fame\" songs would make \"Weird Al\" groan.",
    "This slapstick and scatological spoof settles for obvious punchlines, delivering just enough laughs to justify its existence without coming anywhere near the bar set by \"Scary Movie.\"",
    "There's an art to making a good spoof, but good luck finding it in Dance Flick, not only because the movie goes for easy toilet humor, but because it often relies on it to stay afloat.",
    "There are two dance-offs, multiple fat jokes and one sight gag using eye boogers, a heretofore ignored bodily fluid. These are the highlights.",
    "It's surprising how dated some of the humor is.",
    "If you thought the world couldn't get enough of bad spoof movies, you thought wrong.",
    "Damonically awful."

In \"Dance Flick\", Mr. Moody(Marlon Wayans) uses the word \"dignity\" a lot as he talks And now Keenan Ivory Wayans has something in common with the late Stanley Kubrick. Both filmmakers make reference to the musical \"Singin' in the Rain\". In \"Dance Flick\", Mr. Moody(Marlon Wayans) uses the word \"dignity\" a lot as he talks about the stereotypical \"Negro\"-specific roles he accepted during Hollywood's unenlightened years to a classroom full of bored students. Half a century ago, Gene Kelly's silent film star stood on the red carpet at a gala premiere for his latest movie and says, \"Dignity. Always dignity,\" to describe his years in vaudeville as a burlesque act. Both proclaimers are being ironical. \"Classy\" is an aesthetic that has never been synonymous with Wayans' filmography(the geyser of semen that pins the \"Scary Movie\" franchise girl to the ceiling in an \"American Beauty\" parody comes immediately to mind), but his treatment of the immortal dance flick is classy, especially when you compare it to Kubrick's \"A Clockwork Orange\", in which Malcolm McDowell sings the titular song while viciously beating an old man and woman during a home invasion. What's not classy, however, is how he takes away Halle Berry's dignity by dredging up her old \"Hit and Run Halle\" public image in an admittedly funny throwaway gag. That's so 2000. That's so antithetical to the significance of Berry's breakthrough Oscar-win for Marc Foster's \"Monsters Ball\". Acceptance speech histrionics aside, Berry shed light on the indignity of her thespian predecessors who were regulated to playing \"colored folks\", such as a cotton-picker(Mr. Moody's biggest role) and other roles of its ilk. \"Dance Flick\" has a sociological disconnect, but it's typical of this filmmaker's no holds barred approach towards his own people(e.g. Regina King as the disruptive movie patron who gets murdered in \"Scary Movie\").",
