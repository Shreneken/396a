    "critic_reviews": [
        "Neither the best nor the worst of movies derived from videogames, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li at least gives action fans plenty to ogle besides the titular heroine (Kristin Kreuk), whose original incarnation, legend has it, was among the first distaff figures controllable by joystick.",
        "Reveling in the vivid Bangkok locations, Geoff Boyle\u2019s photography is crisp and bright, and Dion Lam\u2019s action choreography unusually witty.",
        "Director Andrzej Bartkowiak (\"Romeo Must Die\") works hard to supply the appropriate grittiness, but other than a few reasonably well-staged fight sequences, the proceedings are dull and visually uninspired. Justin Marks' solemn screenplay lacks any trace of wit.",
        "A wholly inept action experience that works at boring us to tears.",
        "There's something special about this underwhelming mess of a Street Fighter reboot that many cinematic cheese-lovers will find very appetizing. The fact is that The Legend of Chun-Li is not at all a good flick, but it's filled with so much cornball ineptitude that one would think some rather broken mad movie genius was behind it.",
        "This is a movie for the overcaffeinated, undereducated teenager in all of us.",
        "Idiot plotting and dialogue are what you'd expect from a genre that typically rewards narrative development with a skip function. But the rote fight scenes are a disappointment.",
        "Even with the low expectations The Legend of Chun Li engenders, it still somehow manages to be a letdown.",
        "Don't be fooled by the low grade: This sequel-in-spirit to Jean-Claude Van Damme's 1994 dud doesn't even succeed in being memorably bad.",
        "The problems with Street Fighter: The Legend Of Chun-Li began with the casting of dead-eyed, sleepy-voiced, charisma-impaired automaton Kristin Kreuk.",
        "It boggles the mind that The Legend of Chun-Li is as vapid and dull as it is."

But honestly, everyone is comparing movies against videogames here. In a game you mash all those buttons, make combo hits, fatalities to take down the enemy. The story is usually ignored and 4 out of 5 people doesn't care about story in a game. In movie i want to know about the characters, their origins. If you put a 90 minute long fighting scene in a movie, there will be no difference between a game and a movie. I think this movie was pretty cool and exciting and the reason that many people disliked this was that they want to see meaningless fighting scenes, 10 punches + 3 kicks per second... I am a nerd too, I like marvel, dc, mortal kombat (not so much of a Street Fighter fan actually i always find that game rather dull) but honestly i want to see a background for characters in movies; not a 90 minute full with brawling and gun shooting. The only reason that i gave 9 instead of 10 was that interpol officers kinda stood outside of movie and couldn't participate that much. They should were either totally removed or used more often in film. I strongly suggest this movie to all of you who are interested\u00e2",

How hard can it be to shoot a concert pianist? Very hard, as it turns out; like in the nightclub scene, where the piano player does a handstand and kicks the guns out of four shooters' hands by virtue of a fluid pirouetting motion. Don't mess with Hong Kong via San Francisco, with a matriculating stint in New York, somewhere in the timeline; don't mess with a Julliard grad. Some of them know Wushu. Rachmaninoff isn't just for girly girls. Concert pianist/martial arts expert: that's a pretty absurd notion of being multi-talented, but for a film like \"Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li\", musicianship serves as shorthand for character development. Unfortunately, the girl's piano career is subordinated as a tangent, in favor of her other, more kinetic pursuit. When Chun-li(Kristin Kreuk) goes underground in Thailand, the concert pianist explains that she has to forget her past, in order to become one with Bangkok. How convenient for the film's cross-purposes. Instead of being one of the common people(like the slumming rich girl in Pulp's \"Common People\": Chun-li's rich, too; she says goodbye to her servants before going \"Bangkok Forgetful\"), Chun-li could have stayed off the streets by playing the piano in some dive(and evoke Francois Truffaut's \"Tirez sur le pianiste\"). But that won't do; after all, \"Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-li\" has no real aspirations of being a proper movie. It's pleased as punch with its essentiality of cheesy and uninspired fight sequences under the adulterated facade of girl power. Having the accomplished girl shed her identity just makes it easier for the film to ply its patriarchial bent. Sure, Chun-li kicks ass, but she's under the tutelage of a man. How do you say \"To Sir With Love\" in Mandarin? So the film takes away her best asset: her fingers. For the film's target audience, a woman who supports herself by playing the piano for tip money may constitute the rumblings of a chick flick.",

Who exactly in their right minds chose a fan-favorite hottie from Smallville and the late \"Big Teddy\" Oscar-nominee Michael Clarke Duncan in the first place? Chris Klein sucked in this piece of trash. He should've taken the page out of the Dane Cook \"I'm a serious comedian\" playbook. But in my retrospect, Ming-Na Wen was the better Chun-li in the original Street Fighter. We laughed on this horrible offensive video game movie before, but I should just cut it some slack.
