Learning that the young man is one of her daughter's classmates, Leigh Anne insists that Michael--wearing shorts and a t-shirt in the dead of winter--come out of the cold. Without a moment's hesitation, she invites him to stay at the Tuohy home for the night. What starts out as a gesture of kindness turns into something more as Michael becomes part of the Tuohy family despite the differences in their backgrounds. (Warner Bros.)\u2026 Expand",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "This may be Bullock's best performance. Ever.",
        "Grounded in the direct, disarming truth of their experience, the movie has a straightforward lack of cheap sentiment that saves it from being either too maudlin or saccharine-sweet.",
        "In a head-to-head comparison, one would be hard-pressed not to declare that \"Precious\" is the better film - it makes fewer compromises and doesn't shy from showing the true ugliness only hinted at in this movie, but The Blind Side is more accessible. It's easier to digest. In the end, both films tell stories of triumph over adversity - a category of drama that uplifts while offering a dollop of social commentary.",
        "What makes The Blind Side a Thanksgiving treat is director Hancock's subtle touch and admirable refusal to yield to sports movie clich\u00e9s, something he did previously with \"The Rookie\" and \"Remember the Titans.\"",
        "One of the reasons it's so effective is because it's based on a real-life, odds-defying story: that of mountainous Baltimore Ravens offensive tackle Michael Oher (played by Quinton Aaron).",
        "Without restraint or subtlety, but with a lot of heart and energy, this movie tells a real-life tall tale.",
        "Best performance, minute for minute, comes from Adriane Lenox, whose cameo as Michael's drug-addled mother is the film's standout.",
        "Bullock is an irrepressible hoot in writer-director John Lee Hancock's otherwise thoroughly conventional take on Michael Lewis' fact-based book \"The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game.\"",
        "Uplifting and entertaining feel-good, fact-based sports drama.",
        "The story is inspiring and involves sports, but to call it an inspirational sports story would be wrong; its real center is Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock in a fine performance), the strong-willed woman whose love and generosity helped turn a mute, hopeless boy with no social or academic skills into a functioning young man with a promising future.",
        "Wisely, Hancock has given the film as much humor as heart.",
        "It\u2019s not an altogether convincing portrait, but it is an entertaining, even moving one, and the forcefulness of Bullock's presence goes a long way in pulling the film back from the brink of cuddliness.",
        "Michael as a character is defined almost solely by his helplessness and gratitude. He's as lovable as a lost puppy, but a more perceptive movie than The Blind Side would have let us see him from another angle.",
        "Bullock\u2019s levelheaded acting frequently saves the movie from emotional garishness.",
        "An engaging if transparent tearjerker of the first water.",
        "Has strong performances and stirring football scenes.",
        "For all The Blind Side's flaws, it's impossible not to get caught up in Michael Oher's life.",
        "Bullock delivers a towering performance that grabs the movie and the Oscar race by the scruff of the neck. You will be moved, but at the price of any nuance or complexity.",
        "Unlike the tale told in \"Precious\", however, The Blind Side's story is contrived, storybook sweet, credulity-straining and ... um, true.",
        "A feel-good movie that never stops feeling good. The film is based on a true story (it was adapted from a nonfiction best-seller by Michael Lewis), but you never feel that Hancock has honestly captured what's true about it.",
        "Veers perilously close to the concept of poverty tourism.",
        "Never dull, but it's rarely more than gently entertaining.",
        "A football story that deserves a penalty flag every other play for piling on the sentiment.",
        "The film, not unsurprisingly for a holiday- (and football-) season release from a major Hollywood studio, plays this story straight down the middle, shedding nuance and complication in favor of maximum uplift.",
        "It's fair to say that Bullock's appealing portrait of a strong-willed Tennessee belle ranks among the best work of her career. It's just too bad the movie around her comes up short.",
        "A facile, feel-good fable that substitutes clich\u00e9 for reality at nearly every turn.",
        "Sports movies have a long, troubled history of well-meaning white paternalism, with poor black athletes finding success through white charity. But The Blind Side, based on Michael Lewis\u2019 non-fiction book, finds a new low.",
        "It\u2019s just blinkered middle-class pandering at its most shameless.",
        "Blind Side the movie peddles the most insidious kind of racism, one in which whiteys are virtuous saviors, coming to the rescue of African-Americans who become superfluous in narratives that are supposed to be about them."

Sandra Bullock is terrific! While her role as a Christian woman doing good is primary and that of Michael Oher, the promising offensive lineman, is diminished from what it was in the book, there is still enough football action to hold the attention of guys who follow the game. (Oher became an All_American at Ole Miss after departing the Tuohy household after his high school graduation and then a first round draft choice and now a starter for the Baltimore Ravens.)

I find little fault with the film. The characters are... true. Notably three New York-based critics gave the movie a failing grade. Why? Because the acting was so poor? Or because they did not connect with the message? This is one of those rare moments where I find that the most condemning critics are in the wrong, because it is not the MOVIE they disagree with per se, but the premise. The mere idea that such a series of events unfolded as such is perceived as de facto racist. But you know what, much of life has racial overtones. And I don't find the too-good-to-be-true story any less valued just because it doesn't live up to certain standards as a story of overcoming the odds in a racially segregated (or rather socially racially segregated society.)

In a funny way, this bit of late-breaking information functions the same as the \"he's dead\" revelation in M. Night Shyamalan's \"The Sixth Sense\", because it forces the moviegoer to reexamine all the preceeding scenes under a new frame of reference. Whereas Shyamalan situated the Bruce Willis character sans conversation among the living, this filmmaker too stages scenes that hide the truth in plain sight, then blindsides the moviegoer with a game-changing moment of epiphany. Here, it's in a surprisingly terse scene between Michael(Quintin Aaron) and a NCAA investigator, in which the Touhys are cast in a surprisingly unfavorable light, complicating the film's emotional uplift ever so slightly. Good samaritans or hell-bent boosters? Although the Touhy's are never labeled as such, the evidence of their vested interest in a good left tackle is right in your face all along. An Ole Miss football game on Thanksgiving Day dominates the Touhy household, in which the family gathers around the television from the sofa with their turkey-stuffed plates. When Leigh-Ann(Sandra Bullock) observes her charge sitting by himself at the dining room table, she shuts off the game, and has them join their permanent guest for a more traditional familial holiday arrangement. This is the moment, perhaps, that Leigh-Ann starts to understand how their football-centric lifestyle might need some toning down. (Even the Touhys' young son is put to work as Michael's trainer.) To what extent is her paternalism motivated by a rabid love for Rebel football? Unfortunately, \"The Blind Side\" bails the University of Mississippi alumnists out, during an exchange where Leigh-Ann and Sean(Tim McGraw) suss out their motivations with a proper amount of self-flaggelation, so we don't have to. But in a telling scene, Miss Sue(Kathy Bates), Michael's tutor, tries to recruit the future NFL star away from hated SEC rival Tennessee with a crazy story about Neyland Stadium(where the Volunteers play its home games), which validates the possibility that a well-to-do couple would feed and clothe an offensive line prospect for their beloved team.",

To see his desire in which he eventually made the Deans List at Mississippi and becomes an All American transcends the football story. Talk about second chances in life this is a true feel good story about an exceptional young man and an exceptional family that we would all like to be part of.",

In \"The Blind Side\" Sandra Sandra Bullock is absolutely fantastic! Why? Because she's so believable in her role; most of the time a big name actor gets in the way of their own character because all the audience recognizes is the face. In \"The Blind Side\" Sandra pretty much disappears into her character of Mrs. Tuohy, which allows the movie itself to have a life of it's own as it's big name actor is replaced by a charismatic southern mom. Yes, Mrs. Tuohy does drive the movie, yet she is not too overpowering to where the other characters are drowned out. Michael and the rest of the Tuohy's act superbly within their roles; the scenes with the smallest Tuohy (SJ) and Michael are very humorous and impactful when they need to be. They really portray a good brother to brother relationship. The movie as a whole is more of a drama than a sports film, about the power of family and what it means to challenge yourself: if that means going out of your way to help another, pushing yourself to achieve what you once thought impossible or looking inwardly to see if you really are the person you want to be. Fantastic performance by Sandra, the story is told wonderfully with enough humor to balance the sometimes dramatic or intense turns. Overall a grand accomplishment for feel good cinama! And a final comment: for all the people that seem to think the movie is about a poor black child helped out by the more privileged white angels, I think you are projecting your own prejudice onto a film that clearly does not have that kind of message in mind. Point in fact: I doubt the Golden Globes would recognize an actress for her role in a obviously racist picture if that were the case at all.

The Bright Side should be a case study for what's wrong with American mainstream filmmaking, an exemplar of dumbed-down writing and directing, wrapped in the transparent gauze of reality. As if this \"true story,\" saccharinated to cancer inducing levels, has any resemblance to actual events. Reality is complex; this movie is not. What's worse, the messages are patently offensive: the glorification of wealth, the inherent goodness of whites over blacks, the retreaded notion that sports are the only ticket out of the ghetto. John Lee Hancock has never met a reaction shot he doesn't like. Every time the big kid opens his mouth, Hancock cuts to one of his white savior's droopy expressions -- now, isn't that just the saddest thang y'all evah heard -- just in case we didn't understand that the black boy's plight is worthy of sympathy. Call it the death of subtlety. If that's your bag of popcorn, if you like your film moments telegraphed, if you think critical thinking and entertainment are mutually exclusive terms, The Blind Side is your movie.",

I can't believe some of the ludicrous comments coming from some reviewers, in particular Melissa Anderson from Village Voice. Does she know this movie is based on a true story? Does she realize that white people are overwhelmingly in the upper class of Memphis? Did she skip the entire scene where Bullock's character is discussing adopting Michael but the other 3 white women seemed outraged and disgusted? Where in the world does she get the idea that this movie is in any way about \"whitey\" being \"virtuous saviors\"? Overall, this film was great. It makes you feel good for the characters and how people coming together can accomplish so much. It speaks volumes about how race relations have progressed during the past decades even though there is still a lot to accomplish. One big complaint I have for this movie is Sandra Bullock. While she overall does a good acting job, it felt as if she overdid her character. The other complaint I have is how the author added into the movie things that simply don't fit reality (like Bullock confronting a crack dealer in the middle of the projects), which takes away from how seriously you can take the movie because it begins to slide into a fantasy tale. Nevertheless, all the other aspects of the movie pick up where it slacks. Good family movie. Good time for all. Watch it!",

Upon viewing the final product, my suspicions were validated. Its heart is entirely in the wrong place. The movie ought to be about Michael Oher and how he achieved success, but this is not the case. The Blind Side centers around the kind Southern white woman who takes in an underprivileged black youth. Her kindness, not his struggle, is what the movie is about. To the actors' credit, everyone does a good job. The leads are mostly great, especially Quinton Aaron, but the direction and writing undercuts the performances. The Blind Side is all uplift and no substance. When the movie isn't trying to win your heart with its blatant emotional pandering, it's trying to warm it with sentiment-heavy and sitcom-lite humor, a rather nauseating combination. Also problematic is the unflattering portrait of African Americans. In the movie's eyes, if black people aren't waiting for kind white folk to lend a helping hand, they are either unable to support their families or are manipulative bullies. I suppose there is one business-professional African American woman, but it's telling that she is introduced as a villain. There are moments in The Blind Side where a better movie shines through, one with both the appropriate seriousness and sweetness for the situation, but this better movie is largely overshadowed by the mediocre one in the foreground. It is sadly telling about the state of film when movies like this are nominated for Best Picture.",

This beautiful and touching story shows the life of Michael Oher, a poor street boy who with the help of Leigh Anne, a wealthy housewife, will be successful in life. As the situation develops the protagonist starts asking questions to himself; this part is very interesting because it represents the typical questioning of adolescence. Some examples are: should you always do what others tell you to do? Or sometimes you do not even know why you are doing something; and honor is the real reason either you do something or you don\u2019t, is who you are or maybe who you want to be. Apart from that is captivating the title of the picture; it is called the blind side because every time something bad happened during his difficult childhood the protagonist closed his eyes. The problems of the movie are that recurs excessively to the sports, when it should be used just as a way to transmit the message; and the final investigation is totally out of placed, seems that this part is just filling space.

Like the film's soft-spoken left tackle protagonist, \"The Blind Side\" is a film that comes in like a lamb and goes out like a lamb - but it sure is a lamb with a big heart.",

When I heard all the buzz about papaya, I decided that I just had to try some. Both decisions left a bad taste in my mouth.\r Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy, a plucky gun-wielding mom with a lot of spunk (remember what Lou Grant said about spunk?) One day, Leigh Anne notices a behemoth named Michael Oher (played well by Quinton Aaron) walking around shivering and homeless. She invites him to stay overnight in her upscale home.\r Now, I don't know about most guys, but if some rich woman that looked like Sandra Bullock invited me to stay overnight in her home, I'd be there faster than a Viagra-laden Superman flying to his date with Lois Lane. However, after a few minutes of listening to Tuohy's junior-high psychology as well as enduring her general all-around annoying personality, I'd be out of there faster than Sarah Palin's ouster from a Mensa meeting.\r Then there's Bullock's performance itself. I don't know if it suffered from the fact that she was portraying such an irritating person. I was hoping some hulk from the football team would mistake her for a blocking sled and... well, not really. But maybe the fact that the character got under my skin so much says something about Bullock's acting.\r I doubt however that this is what was intended by all those involved in making this flick.\r And, by the way, I'm still waiting for the first great football film to be made (the best of the bunch, Jerry McGuire and Heaven Can Wait can only marginally be considered football films).",
