  "critic_reviews": [
    "Terrifying and beautiful, believable and fantastical, this is one of the best children's films in years and Selick's finest -- better even than \"The Nightmare Before Christmas.\"",
    "This thrilling stop-motion animated adventure is a high point in Selick's career of creating handcrafted wonderlands of beauty blended with deep, disconcerting creepiness.",
    "Selick's fantastical adaptation of Neil Gaiman's novel will be too dazzlingly rich for many; it'll be like \"caviare to the general,\" as Hamlet said of a complex play enacted for a public with lazy minds.",
    "A classic fairy tale with a contemporary sensibility and a spooky horror under the candy-house fantasy.",
    "The results are nothing short of magical.",
    "A remarkable feat of imagination, a magical tale with a genuinely sinister edge.",
    "Thankfully, Coraline is appropriately dark, and like its inspiration, is only a children's movie by the thinnest of margins.",
    "What a shrewd achievement for writer-director Henry Selick (\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\"), to have made a movie that everyone will acclaim as beautiful, when perhaps the most beautiful thing about it is the sheer ugliness of it all.",
    "This is a marvelous family story, tapping into all sorts of childhood dreams and nightmares involving Mommy, monsters and heroic youngsters. Selick's imaginative sets and puppets are in perfect pitch with Gaiman's fantasy.",
    "Coraline lingers in an atmosphere that is creepy, wonderfully strange and full of feeling.",
    "This is perhaps the most effective 3-D movie I have ever seen, with a sophisticated, involving story that will appeal to many adults. The only reservation I have is with the PG rating, which seems too lenient for a story that may give very young children - particularly if they are sensitive - nightmares.",
    "The combination of 3-D photography and puppet-animation - centered on actual figures designed by hand and manipulated frame by frame - creates a world that's dense, active and fluid: a sensory Jacuzzi.",
    "The story is creepy fun and 100-percent different than whatever other crap is flooding the February market.",
    "It pulls audiences into a meticulously detailed universe, familiar in many respects, wacked and menacing in many others.",
    "A macabre mystery for children and a cautionary tale for their folks, Coraline is a yarn - twisty, knotty, taut - about a perennially bored girl whose parents are too preoccupied with work to pay her much mind.",
    "Selick puts his real faith not in the gimmickry that Coraline's audiences will think they've shown up for, but in the stronger virtues that they'd likely view as old-fashioned: character, and story, and handmade figures, handmade milkshakes, handmade blades of grass, each one moving utterly persuasively as he and his animators tweak it, frame by frame.",
    "For its sheer visual gusto alone, Coraline is a wonder.",
    "At the finale of this visual delight, every hired hand and technician also deserve acclaim.",
    "Coraline is a beautifully designed, rather scary answered-prayer story.",
    "This eccentric and deliriously inventive fantasy finds stop-motion auteur Henry Selick scaling new heights of ghoulish whimsy, buoyed by a haunting score that works its own macabre magic.",
    "Coraline Jones isn't the pluckiest or most ingratiating sprite ever to take center stage in a children's film, and her (mis)adventures aren't especially novel, but Coraline is still a consistent splendor to behold.",
    "Coraline is essentially faithful to the spirit of its source material. But it's also so visually inventive, and so elaborately tactile, that it stands apart as its own creation.",
    "Stays remarkably true to a kid's-eye perspective and dormant fears.",
    "The film has been crafted with a consideration that the best family movies appeal not only to a young target audience but to the parents who accompany their offspring to theaters.",
    "This is a gloomy film with weird characters doing nasty things. I've heard of eating chocolate-covered insects, but not when they're alive.",
    "OK, sensitive tykes may be scared shitless. But those who tough it out with this twisted, trippy adventure in impure imagination will only be the better for it.",
    "\"The Corpse Bride\" with teeth, Bruno Bettelheim retooled for the multiplex,\r\na nightmare of daft and creative consequence. I really liked it.",
    "Essentially a horror movie for kids, but it is also gentle and funny and whimsical, and even in its darkest moments, Selick never forgets who his target audience is. Still, some young children might have a nightmare or two after seeing it.",
    "Presented the usual way, the film would be enchanting. In 3-D, however, Coraline is completely engrossing. Selick uses the technique brilliantly to enhance the comedy and horror that mingle in his more \"family-friendly\" version of Gaiman's dark story.",
    "An extraordinary achievement that nevertheless falls short of its full potential, Coraline is absolutely worth seeing, for older children and adults alike. But the connection will be entirely through your eyes; if you want it to touch your heart, you'll have to go to the book on which it's based.",
    "This is the animated film as art film. Coraline doesn't try to ingratiate; it just looms, like a cemetery gate, daring curious souls to tiptoe in and fend for themselves.",
    "Moment by moment, the film is a font of pleasures, yet there's something about it that keeps the audience at an aesthetic remove. Like Coraline in the doppelgänger world, we swoon over all the neat stuff without ever making ourselves at home.",
    "It's the first stop-motion feature filmed entirely in stereoscopic 3-D, and the technique makes Selick's artwork even more wondrously creepy. The problem is Gaiman's story, which keeps accumulating otherworldly mythology but doesn't establish a clear line of action in the home stretch.",
    "Director Henry Selick is all too effective at conjuring grody ghastliness. He's less effective at giving that ghastliness a human dimension, a resonance, a reason for being beyond cheap thrills.",
    "Coraline is a plucky heroine, and director Selig's imagination is indisputable. But the story falters in parts, and its dark tone could be off-putting for children.",
    "Selick has a great fantasy filmmaker's artistry, but he lacks that overflowing Geppetto-esque love that brings puppets to life. In Coraline, he's woozy with his own lyricism.",
    "For all its visual delights, however, Coraline remains more an engaging spectacle than a connective drama. That is chiefly because of the writing. Director-writer Henry Selick doesn't reach for the kind of universality that would enrich the movie.",
    "Coraline is distinguished, if you can call it that, by a creepiness so deep as to seem perverse, and the film finally succumbs to terminal deficits in dramatic energy, narrative coherence and plain old heart."

His foray into Neil Gaiman has always been an acquired taste. His visions of twisted reality in all of his works has always been more appealing to me as in book form rather than as a visual entertainment. Coraline is no exception. His foray into children's books with the publication of Coraline was a surprise to many but his quirky story was well written and appealing on paper. On film however, it just seems...well, strange. Not exactly a kid's movie and not exactly a film for adult's either. The skill it took to animate using stop action movement should be appreciated. Some stop motion techniques exhibited in this film were simply astonishing. But technique alone does not make a good film. A great film for film students does not make a great film for the average viewer. Consider the twisted universe of the film's reality and the even more twisted vision of the film's alternate reality. Look at the scenes with the almost nude acrobatic sisters. Listen to the awful vocal music, This is not a film for children. Let your kids read the book instead and let them use their own imagination to fill in the blanks. And a final note: The 3D theatrical version must have been something to watch. DO not fall for the DVD's 3D version. It is simply bad. Using red and green cardboard glasses, the film is colorless, dark, eye-aching awfulness. The producers of the DVD's 3D packaging should be ashamed.",

I’d like to inform you of positive andCoraline will Sewprise You from the BeginningI recently watched the movie Coraline made by Laika Entertainment during English class. It was a very entertaining movie but also had an odd fee9ling to it. I’d like to inform you of positive and some negative points to the movie and why you should watch it. Coraline is about a girl who has to move to a new home, called the Pink Palace. She goes exploring outside her new home and meets a new ‘friend’ named Wybie. He is not aloud to go into the pink palace because his grandmother says it’s “dangerous.” One day while Coraline was exploring her new home, she found a mysterious door. At first it’s locked but she makes her mom find the key to the door. When she opens it up, it’s filled with brick. During the night, when everyone else is sleeping, a mouse lead her to this suspicious door she was so curious in. She opens it up once more but this time there is no brick and it brings her to another dimension. Everything in this universe is considered to be much better than Coraline’s reality. In the normal world her parents avoid her, the mom doesn’t cook dinner, and, they won’t grow a garden. In this opposite universe, everything is more enjoyable. Her other mother and father love Coraline, and spend lots of time with her. Show her amazing shows performed by Bobinsky, and cook amazing dinners. But, is it as great as it seems? Some things I like about this movie is its plot and the voices were very good. There was also lots of things going on in the movie which made it interesting. Some things I didn’t like includes, it’s not age appropriate. The animation made it very dark and mysterious, which could easily scare a 5-7 year old. But, there was many good things about this movie as well. For example, it always kept you at the edge of your seat, and there are many surprises that could be peeking around the corner. Coraline gets to enjoy fancy gardens and nice dinners which is shows a very happy and positive effect on the movie. She gets everything she wants in the world and is offered to stay forever. Overall, Coraline was a entertaining move, but should not be rated PG.The group of people that would like this movie is probably teens and adults. The movie is rated PG but I would only recommend it for the upper elementary kids and older.  I think that because the movie is scary and too mature for young kids. It contains some minor animated nudity. Which, some parents will not find appropriate for their 7 year old children. But, I do understand why it is PG. It is animated and contains dolls and playful young children. But, some things like, the creepy dolls and button eyes could scare younger children more than entertain them. It also contains creepy classical music that could cause chills down your back. It’s a good movie, but I only recommend it for older children, teens, and adults. Scale of 5 Stars: 4 Stars ****",

When I heard that there was going to be a movie version, I was excited. And the movie did not disappoint.\r The story has an Alice in Wonderland vibe since it involves a young girl ending up in topsy turvy word. It reminds me of Corpse Bride in the designs of the two worlds where the real world is grey and drab while the alternate world is colorful and fantastical. I love the design of the Other Mother's world. It's bright and colorful and everything is made to please Coraline. However, as Coraline starts to resist, everything becomes darker and the Other Mother looks less and less human. And I don't know about anyone else, but the climax scared me to death.\r I also enjoyed the characters. Coraline is a believable kid. She's kooky and weird and has strange taste in fashion. She gets on her parents nerves but she just wants them to to pay attention to her. The parents are also believable. There are times when my parents are so wrapped up in their work that they don't have time for me. They aren't bad people. They're just unbelivably stressed. The Other Mother is freaky as hell. She really seems like the kind of mother we all wish we had. She's funny and loving and gives you whatever you want. Too bad she's doing it so that she can ensnare and kill you. The other characters are mostly hit or miss.\r Fans of the book might not like the changes made, but I think there were for the better. The book lacked detailed descriptions about Coraline's appearance. I really liked the blue hair. It fits her character. I also like the addition of Wybie. While he wasn't a HUGE part of the plot, they made his character relevant. And thank god they didn't make him a love interest.\r I can understand why people wouldn't like it as much. It does have a lot of slow moments, but I liked those scenes because they were used to show us what kind of person Coraline is and about her relationship with her parents and Wybie.\r I'm not sure if it will appeal to Tim Burton fans. It doesn't strike the same balance between macabre, comedy, and whimsy, but it's not trying to be The Nightmare Before Christmas. The only things it has in common with it is stopmotion and director Henry Selick. If you like stopmotion, this is a good movie to see.\r And if you liked this movie, watch Laika's other major stopmotion film, ParaNorman.",

He realized the reasons storytelling have been significantly important since the dawn of mankind, and devised, as the Brothers Grimm did, that fairy tales and children's stories had to be haunting and entertaining to be both memorable and timeless. This is a great film depicting the growing sense as a child approaches adolescence that their parents and their world aren't exactly as they seem, and that through their trials and tribulations (the 'rites of passage', if you will) they'll reach the 'happy medium' they need to in order to find true happiness in their lifetimes.\r I definitely hope that all of Gaiman's books and graphic novels are made into movies (I most anticipate the 'Miracleman' graphic novels--both those by him and Alan Moore).

She was forced to move away from all her friends and live in the Pink Palace. From there she faces challenges but meets new friends along the way. Laika is the company that produced  this movie. We thought Henry Selick (the director) and Laika did a great job making this movie happen.    “Coraline” took place in the Pink Palace Apartments where she found a magical doorway that leads to an alternative, better world. In the other world she meets improved versions of the people she knows, such as her parents. Everything in that world is how she wants her life to be. This world ended up being pretty dangerous for Coraline. Coraline struggles to find her way and learns to appreciate what she has and not what she wants. We liked the stop motion animation in this movie and appreciate how long it takes to do it. We also liked all the characters such as Coraline, Wybie, Bobinsky, and the Black Cat. One of our favorite scenes in the middle of the movie was about one of the many wonders, the other father’s garden. The beautiful flowers seem to come to life as she walks through the garden. One of our least favorite scenes from the movie is when she had to throw the black cat to escape one of the many dangers. Overall, we all think that this movie is really good. This movie is PG, but we think that a certain age group should watch it. It could be hard for little kids to understand and it will most likely scare them. We recommend ages 10 and up so they will be understand the actual storyline. We also don’t recommend this movie to adults, but it is still good for all age groups. Overall this movie is pretty good but is hard to understand the plot and the message that goes with it.",

I just watched this movie in my 8th grade English class. “Coraline” gave me the chills throughout the whole movie. The movie has many different opinions, but you either hated it or you liked it. I was more in between. “Coraline” is made with clay animation which in my opinion makes the movie a little bit scarier. It also has many scenes in the movie that were a little sketchy and scary. “Coraline” was made by Laika Entertainment, they specialize in clay animation, just like “Coraline.”\tIn present day Oregon, 11 year old Coraline Jones  (Dakota Fanning) moved to the Pink Palace Apartment. She meets her neighbors Wybie, Mr. Bobinsky, and Ms. F and Ms. S. Coraline feels her life is boring because of the lack of attention from her parents. Out of curiousity Coraline stumbles upon a secret door leading to a new dimension. There she meets her other mother (Teri Hatcher). Her other mother gives her anything she could imagine, new clothes, delicious food, and even made a garden out of the shape of her face. Everything seems to be perfect to Coraline until she wants to go back home, but discovers she may not leave her other mother. Coraline finds out the truth about the new dimension. Coraline must figure out a plan to leave. Coraline uses her strategic ways to escape her other mother. The characters in “Coraline” had great stories about them, but their bodies were out of proportion and not realistic. Mr. Bobinsky was 10 feet tall and his skin color was blue. Coraline’s relationship with her parents didn’t develop as well as I would have liked it. In the beginning they barely talked and it doesn’t get resolved until the last ten minutes of the movie. The movie’s clay animation created a creepier vibe than a kid friendly one because when the characters have eyes for buttons it’s not a pleasant thing to see. Even though some parts I did not like, the movie did have some positive elements about it. I like how it taught a lesson in the story, “ Be happy with what you have.” The movie had a suspenseful plot leading up to the big climax of the story. I also liked that it was playful at times when Coraline had to go find the eyes of the lost ghosts. This movie is PG, a rating that might not be appropriate to younger children, especially from the ages 5-7. I would recommend parents watch the movie first to find out if your child would like it. The movie was awarded a Golden Globe for best animated movie of the year in 2010, a year after it was released. Overall I thought the movie was great. It was entertaining and suspenseful all at the same time, but I would not watch the movie again.Scale of Stars:3 Stars out of 5",

Parents bringing their children along to theSweet “Coraline”We watched “Coraline” recently and thought it deserved a review. “Coraline” was released in 2009 by Laika Entertainment and introduced a surprisingly dark tale told by stop motion. Parents bringing their children along to the movie theater to see “Coraline” had no idea what they were in for. What seemed like a adorable, sugar-sweet movie about a young girl turned out to be a nightmare inducing film. “Coraline” starts out with a family moving into a new home in the Pink Palace Apartments. Viewers will quickly realize that Coraline’s parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) are not very good listeners. While exploring in and around her new home, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) meets a supporting character named Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.), who later gives her a doll that bears a striking resemblance to her. When she explores her living room, she discovers a portal hidden in the wallpaper that leads to a “better” alternate reality where everyone has buttons for eyes. This is where the plot gets dark. Coraline meets her “other mother” who gives her everything she could ever want. Coraline is convinced she wants to stay forever, but at a cost. Her other mother wants to replace Coraline’s eyes with buttons. After realizing this world is not what it seems, Coraline talks to some supporting characters, like the eccentric Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane), and two drama-obsessed ladies. The ladies, Miss Forcible (Dawn French) and Miss Spink (Jennifer Saunders), do perform a rather...interesting dance in the alternate reality that includes both of them nearly nude. Despite that suggestive scene, all these characters come in handy to fix the conflict in the movie. “Coraline” is not as sweet as it seems. That dark plot is meant for older children, but the compelling storyline requires you to pay attentiont to find out what happens. The animation would be perfect if it weren’t for the way the characters were portrayed. Some of them are a bit creepy and could traumatize young minds. We think that the movie wasn’t age appropriate and was given the wrong rating of PG. We believe that “Coraline” should’ve been rated PG-13. For example, children probably wouldn’t enjoy the fact that characters attempt to sew buttons into other characters eyes. However, there were a few lessons to be learned if your child wasn’t running out of the room crying. The animations were one of the movies positives and the characters fit the creepy vibe the movie portrays. This movie does have a creepy vibe to it, so we recommend it to young adults. This movie could scare younger children with its dark nature. We think this movie would better suit 10-14 year olds. Do not show your younger children “Coraline”, unless you want them to wake you up in the middle of the night. Our final rating comes down to the movie not being age appropriate despite the beautiful stop motion and interesting plot line. Be careful what you wish for! Final rating: B-",

Henry Selicks’ “Coraline”, is an interesting,  imaginative and creative movie. While the creepiness of the movie gets to me, it delivers an informational message that not many children will pick up on, but an adult, or 14 year old, could get the message. This movie never seemed to bore me or others at any time keeping all of us entertained or immersed in what's happening.When Coraline moves into Pink Palace apartments, she feels bored and alone because she doesn’t have any friends and her parents are always working. She soon meets a boy about her age named Wybie, and her neighbors Miss. F,  Miss. S, and Mr. Bobinski. Coraline then finds a hidden passageway that leads to an alternate universe where everybody has buttons sewn into their eyes and she gets everything she wants including tons of attention from her ‘other parents’. She goes there everyday for awhile. One day they tell her that if she wants to, she can live with them forever but only on one HUGE condition. That’s when she realizes that everything’s not as perfect as it seems in the alternate universe and learns to accept what she has outside of the alternate universe even if it’s not everything she wants.    While “Coraline” was an interesting film, it had a few flaws and things I strongly disliked. Firstly, it might be kind of hard to explain the moral of the story to a toddler. Second, the animation was slightly off at times. But there were many perfections about this movie too, such as the creativity in the names. It had good twists, and the animation was okay at times and kind of creepy.  “Coraline” is rated PG with some considerable sinister scenes from beginning to end. The movie is aimed for children to get a lesson across that we should not take anything for granted because it could be much worse. Coraline was planned out and told pretty well with the voices and characters being spot on with how you would expect it to be. To really get a grip on the movie and it’s meaning an older audience would be suggested. I would recommend this movie to anybody 10 or older and ready to sink into a great movie. Coraline showing great morals and a great story makes this movie top-notch and a definite must watch again.",

Henry Selick and Neil Gaiman have a great team of animators that have constructed amazing movies such as: The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. This time, the 3D effects are less than impressive and the stop-motion seemed rushed. Dakota Fanning impressively played Coraline but nothing can make up for this trainwreck.We recommend this odd piece of film for children 10+. It was creepy and not suitable for little children as it can easily give them horrific nightmares even though the rating is PG. The MPAA rating system really underestimated how eerie and frightening this film could be for the target audience, therefore it should’ve been rated PG-13. The movie was atrocious and caused drowsiness after the mid-way point in the movie, and it was a waste of time and money.Final Rating: 2 out of 5 Stars",

This movie wasn’t the best movie I’ve seen, and I may be slightly biased  since this isn’t a genre I enjoy that much. “Coraline”, made by LaikaI recently watched this film and thought it wasn’t half bad. In fact, it was better than that. This movie wasn’t the best movie I’ve seen, and I may be slightly biased  since this isn’t a genre I enjoy that much. “Coraline”, made by Laika Entertainment, made a unique, different type of stop motion film with a darker twist to it. The story is far different than any other traditional kid’s movie, and the film must’ve been a major risk considering that no one had made a movie like this for such a young audience.The movie starts with the main character, Coraline, moving into an apartment for the summer. After exploring, she later finds a well, and not too long after she meets Wybie. Then Wybie tells Caroline that that house is haunted, because his grandma's sister went missing in the Pink Palace, the company that owns the apartment complex Coraline's living in. Coralline also finds out that Wybie has a doll that looks exactly like Coraline herself. The night Coraline found the doll, she went to bed, but was a awaken in the middle of the night and led to the secret door by a mouse, that is now open. The door acts as a portal, that leads to another dimension just like her own, yet there are a new set of parents. This dimension is mostly the same, but for one huge difference, they all have buttons for eyes. In this world, there is another version of her mother, and through a series of events she manages to gain Coraline’s trust, but It turns out that her other mother is an evil beldam that wants to be loved, forever. Through vigerous tasks Coraline eventually has to free her parents that the Other Mother has captured and escape the dimension she is trapped in. My favorite part about this film is the stop motion animation, and how unique it is for it’s making in 2009. For me personally, I love and absolutely adore unique art styles and indifferent animation styles, and that also goes for this film as well. There are plenty of stop motion films, but this catches my eye just for it’s unusually dark story. The animation was a little clunky at times, where the movements of the characters were a little choppy rather than smooth. I also like just how bizarre it can be, especially in a scene where the world seems to deteriorate. There are many scenes that are bizarre enough to reach my expectations. I wouldn’t recommend this movie to many younger viewers, most children seven or under should avoid this film. When I was around the age of five, I saw this film for the first time and it absolutely terrified me, and after that experience I never wanted to see it again because it scared me so badly. However, coming back to view the movie nine years later I can appreciate that it’s a good film. I’d highly recommend this to viewers of the age ten or older. Most young children wouldn’t even be able to appreciate the film for what it is anyway. Though the film is rated PG, it should’ve been a little higher or have some age restriction on the film. My view of the film is that it’s one I like, just not my favorite. However I am a slightly biased just since it’s not my favorite genre of film.",

Most of us were really engaged in the plot and it kept us wanting to see the next scene. The story starts off with a doll being made that looks identical to Coraline.

Then, Coraline was looking through her new home when she came across a small door behind the wallpaper. At first, there was only bricks behind it. But, during the night she woke up and there was a mouse that lead her to the door. Behind it was another world where she met her other parents with button eyes. She experiences different things like a performance at Mr. B’s house and amazing feasts made by her other parents. Behind the door, her life is everything she ever wanted. But, everything turns upside down when she finds out what her other mother really wants from her.There were lots of things we liked, and some things we didn’t like as much. Something we particularly liked about the movie was all of the details in the characters and the scenery. The first scene when Wybie and Coraline first met, kept us on the edge of our seats. Another thing we liked was the stop-motion animation. The portal to the other world was really detailed. One of the most liked characters was the cat because it can talk and he helps Coraline in the movie. We found that the buttons for eyes was a really creepy touch to the story, and we didn’t really enjoy it. But, we understood that it was an important touch to the story. Something else that was really creepy was when the mice that showed Coraline the doors turned into rats.Although the movie was really interesting, we wouldn’t recommend the movie for children under the age of eight. The story can be a little frightening to it’s target audience. There are lots of scary characters and scenes that could not be the best for kids under 8. But, we think adults and kids older than eight would really enjoy the movie. The movie’s MPAA rating is PG because it has some scary images. We would say that this movie is great and really interesting. We give this movie 5 out of 5 stars. We gave it this rating because the suspense and action kept us wanting more.",

The animation style  in this movie is amazing it goes it extreme detail. This movie isn’t really appropriate for younger kids but if kid enjoys creepy Tim Burton Movies then they would enjoy this movie. Laika Entertainment once again made a genius movie for people wanting to watch animated movies that are gloomy.In the movie “Coraline”, Coraline moves into here new apartment called the Pink Palace in the middle of nowhere. At first she doesn’t like the Pink Palace because she thinks it is boring and there is nothing to do. She found somebody named Wybie and he gave her a doll that looked just liked her. Her parents always are working and never have time for her. She goes looking around the house and finds the door. She goes into the kitchen and asked her mom for the key, her mom finds the key in a drawer and goes to open the door Coraline was talking about. She opens the door and it's a brick wall.  Then it was time for bed, she went to her room and fell asleep and mice came in her room and woke her up and lead her to the little door. She opened the door and found there was an opening and it lead her to her other mother, who is a creepy and controlling. Watch this movie in order to find out Coraline’s fate. I really enjoyed this movie and the actors and how they put emotion into this movie. One of my favorite parts was when they went into the alternate reality and met the other parents. The animation was so bright and colorful. The garden scene is vibrant and makes you want to be in a garden. Coraline is known for her blue hair an    d daring personality.What i didn’t like was how it had too many plot holes for you to figure out as the movie went on. A plot hole is basically how you have to figure out what happened without the movie directly telling what has happened.I would recommend this movie to the age of 8 and up. An 8 year old may not understand it as well but they would still enjoy it. A 13 year old would understand some of the difficult topics like the alternate reality. This movie might scare little children because there is some parts where it can or may scare them. Its rated PG because of the images  and some of the language. I also think it was a great movie because it explained a perfected story and it explained things really well but some parts did get confusing that's why we gave it a four star rating. 4 out of 5 stars rating",

This movie is like Wallace and Gromit meets Ghostbusters creepy. Laika Entertainment really liked to build up suspense and action whenever something big was about to happen to Coraline. This movie is about a girl named Coraline. She moved to an apartment complex called the Pink Palace. She goes exploring and meets a boy named Wybie with a strange stray cat. She runs into a weird and crazy circus ringleader named Mr. B. Also, she finds a pair of twins that own three dogs and live in the basement and they always argue with each other and can tell her the future. She explores the house and discovers a hidden door. The door at first was blocked by bricks but after she starts to fall asleep. She hears mice in her room goes of to chase them and the mice end up going to the door. She opens it and finds out that the door is a portal to an alternate universe controlled by Other Mother. She did everything to make Coraline’s life happier but just to take her because she “needs love.”I thought the movie “Coraline” was a really good and interesting movie. It was really specific on how old and run-down the place was. The movie started out with Coraline having a rough time living in a new place. It is a really eerie movie because she was living with mysterious neighbors and there was a lot of minor things that helped like the fog and the setting. I just didn’t like the rating for it because it would be a little scary for younger kids. There is also a boy named Wybie with a stray cat that stalks her and she can’t do or have a lot of the things that she wants. I think the people who like scary or creepy movies would like this movie. I recommend not letting the littler kids see this. It’s more meant for kids about 11 and up. It is extremely creepy and would scare little kids. I would rate this movie PG-13 because 13 year olds would like this movie if they don’t get creeped out. I say “Coraline” is an overall good movie. I give it an A or 5 stars.",

ProducedI would describe Coraline as a “kid-friendly horror movie”. A movie for only the children with brave souls that can handle jump scares, characters that not only look a little scary, but possess voices that are anything but soothing. Produced by Laika Entertainment, Coraline creates a very twisted plot which presents the theme of “be careful what you wish for”, but does this movie depict the theme in a way which children will learn from it? I believe it does, if the child isn’t covering their eyes and ears throughout the climax of the movie.\tThe introduction of this movie, will have the audience disturbed right off the bat. Hands, with long fingers of steel, intricately ripping into the seams of a stuffed doll and recreating its fabrics to make it look exactly like the main character, Coraline. Coraline is a spunky child who had just recently moved into ‘The Pink Palace’, a three story townhome located in the middle of the woods. Coraline goes outside one day, to be disturbed by a stray cat, and her new annoying friend Wybie. We don’t know where Wybie lives, but we do know that he is forbidden from going into the Pink Palace by his strict grandmother. Wybie states that his grandmother doesn’t allow him in the Pink Palace because his grandma’s sister was ‘stolen’ while exploring the Pink Palace and never returned. Coraline, being the sassy thing that she is, rolls her eyes at the thought of her home being dangerous and ignores Wybie. She then comes home, and experiences her parents ignoring her, because they are too busy hunched over their computers to play with her and is disappointed because her parents treat her like she doesn’t exist. The next day, Wybie introduces Coraline to Mr. B, an insane acrobat who is disgustingly flexible. Soon after, Wybie gives Coraline a doll that looks almost exactly like her. Coraline takes the doll and sets it near her bed in a position as if it is watching her. I believe she does this to make it feel like someone does care about her parents, because her parents don’t show they care about her at all whatsoever.\tLater, while Coraline’s parents are minding their own business, Coraline finds a small door inside of a wall. She nags her mom for the key to this door, and she does, in exchange for Coraline to leave her alone. Coraline finds that nothing is there but a brick wall, a big disappointment for Coraline. That night she finds jumping mice, that lead her to the small door. When it is opened, she has access to a colorful tunnel, that leads to an entire new world! This new world greets her with an abundant feast and new parents. These parents call themselves the ‘other mother’, and the ‘other father’, and they fill this other world with wonders and superficial love and care for ‘their child’. Coraline soon discovers that this world isn’t what it claims to be, only to learn to “be careful what you wish for”.Coraline, is a movie that in our opinion, has many positives and negatives. For example, we really enjoyed the stop motion animation that most somewhat recent movies don’t have. We also enjoyed the parts of the movie that were more uplifting, such as when the other mother and other father fed her, showed her the garden that looked like an exact replica of Coraline’s face, the circus shown by Mr. B and the circus mice, and the dog theatre, where an exotic play was presented by Ms. Forcible. However, this movie did have multiple negatives. The dark storyline will definitely either scare a young audience away, or bore them to sleep. Overall we would give this movie a 3 star rating, because we all thought the movie was weird and disturbing but at some parts we liked how it all connected throughout the movie. The type of people to watch the movie depends how brave they are. Children ten and older could watch it, but little kids can watch it if they are brave enough. I would recommend this movie to people who like a little jump-scary action with a gloomy atmosphere. Coraline’s MPAA rating is PG. The movie has its good parts and its bad places, but we thought it was okay.",

I would say that I liked the animation style, and the message was great. Although, I don’t know if I would watch it again. “Coraline” takes place at Pink Palace Apartments. Coraline doesn’t really get along with her parents. She is upset about moving, and in her boredom decides to explore her new home. She finds a small, locked door and wonders why it’s there. In the night, a mouse shows her that it’s a magical portal to another dimension. Coraline loves it there and is eager to keep going to her other mom and dad through that door. Her friend Wybie and other people in the apartment building warn her not to go back, but she did anyways because of all the fun she’d have there. Coraline soon realizes that she was wrong, and tries to run away when her Other Mother reveals her true identity.    I don’t know if I can say I liked the plot to “Coraline.” It seemed all over the place at the end, with Coraline making a bet and having to defeat the villain twice, and it kind of lost it’s creepy tone for a while. It also seemed too scary for their target audience. You have to give Laika Entertainment credit for its stop-motion, though. It was smooth for the most part and their character and set designs were great. The movie also had a great message about loving your family so that would be a plus.    While the rating, PG, suggests that this movie might be good for little kids, I think it should be a PG-13 rating. With a woman begging to be loved and stealing the souls of innocent children, “Coraline” can be creepy at times and might be a little scary for young children. The “other” dimension characters come off as almost lifeless towards the end, one even tells Coraline about their suffering. I wouldn’t say this movie was bad, but it wasn’t great either.",

She was forced to move away from all her friends and live in the Pink Palace. From there she faces challenges but meets new friends along the way. Laika is the company that produced  this movie. We thought Henry Selick (the director) and Laika did a great job making this movie happen.    “Coraline” took place in the Pink Palace Apartments where she found a magical doorway that leads to an alternative, better world. In the other world she meets improved versions of the people she knows, such as her parents. Everything in that world is how she wants her life to be. This world ended up being pretty dangerous for Coraline. Coraline struggles to find her way and learns to appreciate what she has and not what she wants. We liked the stop motion animation in this movie and appreciate how long it takes to do it. We also liked all the characters such as Coraline, Wybie, Bobinsky, and the Black Cat. One of our favorite scenes in the middle of the movie was about one of the many wonders, the other father’s garden. The beautiful flowers seem to come to life as she walks through the garden. One of our least favorite scenes from the movie is when she had to throw the black cat to escape one of the many dangers. Overall, we all think that this movie is really good. This movie is PG, but we think that a certain age group should watch it. It could be hard for little kids to understand and it will most likely scare them. We recommend ages 10 and up so they will be understand the actual story line. We also don’t recommend this movie to adults, but it is still good for all age groups. Overall this movie is pretty good but is hard to understand the plot and the message that goes with it.",

We witnessed the horror called “Coraline” unfold before our eyes. It’s a dark fantasy film constructed with bad-quality, stop-motion animation. This movie is rated PG and was produced by Laika Entertainment.“Coraline” starts out with a family moving to the 150 year old “Pink Palace,” out in the middle of Ashland, Oregon. The family begins a series of events that are out of the ordinary. First, they find a doll at the doorstep that looks exactly like Coraline and she hauls it around wherever travels take her. She then discovers a hidden door behind the living room wallpaper and Coraline’s mom unlocks it. It’s blocked with bricks until the darkness of night turns it into a magical tunnel that leads to an alternate dimension with the same house and people the difference is that they have buttons for eyes. To find out what happens in this alternate dimension, You will have to watch the movie yourself.“Coraline” is a creepy gothic movie meant for young children that lacks interest from start to end. Henry Selick and Neil Gaiman have a great team of animators that have constructed amazing movies such as: The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. This time, the 3D effects are less than impressive and the stop-motion seemed rushed. Dakota Fanning impressively played Coraline but nothing can make up for this trainwreck.We recommend this odd piece of film for children 10+. It was creepy and not suitable for little children as it can easily give them horrific nightmares even though the rating is PG. The MPAA rating system really underestimated how eerie and frightening this film could be for the target audience, therefore it should’ve been rated PG-13. The movie was atrocious and caused drowsiness after the mid-way point in the movie, and it was a waste of time and money.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nI recently watched this film and thought it wasn’t half bad. In fact, it was better than that. This movie wasn’t the best movie I’ve seen, and I may be slightly biased  since this isn’t a genre I enjoy that much. “Coraline”, made by Laika Entertainment, made a unique, different type of stop motion film with a darker twist to it. The story is far different than any other traditional kid’s movie, and the film must’ve been a major risk considering that no one had made a movie like this for such a young audience.The movie starts with the main character, Coraline, moving into an apartment for the summer. After exploring, she later finds a well, and not too long after she meets Wybie. Then Wybie tells Caroline that that house is haunted, because his grandma's sister went missing in the Pink Palace, the company that owns the apartment complex Coraline's living in. Coralline also finds out that Wybie has a doll that looks exactly like Coraline herself. The night Coraline found the doll, she went to bed, but was a awaken in the middle of the night and led to the secret door by a mouse, that is now open. The door acts as a portal, that leads to another dimension just like her own, yet there are a new set of parents. This dimension is mostly the same, but for one huge difference, they all have buttons for eyes. In this world, there is another version of her mother, and through a series of events she manages to gain Coraline’s trust, but It turns out that her other mother is an evil beldam that wants to be loved, forever. Through vigerous tasks Coraline eventually has to free her parents that the Other Mother has captured and escape the dimension she is trapped in. My favorite part about this film is the stop motion animation, and how unique it is for it’s making in 2009. For me personally, I love and absolutely adore unique art styles and indifferent animation styles, and that also goes for this film as well. There are plenty of stop motion films, but this catches my eye just for it’s unusually dark story. The animation was a little clunky at times, where the movements of the characters were a little choppy rather than smooth. I also like just how bizarre it can be, especially in a scene where the world seems to deteriorate. There are many scenes that are bizarre enough to reach my expectations. I wouldn’t recommend this movie to many younger viewers, most children seven or under should avoid this film. When I was around the age of five, I saw this film for the first time and it absolutely terrified me, and after that experience I never wanted to see it again because it scared me so badly. However, coming back to view the movie nine years later I can appreciate that it’s a good film. I’d highly recommend this to viewers of the age ten or older. Most young children wouldn’t even be able to appreciate the film for what it is anyway. Though the film is rated PG, it should’ve been a little higher or have some age restriction on the film. My view of the film is that it’s one I like, just not my favorite. However I am a slightly biased just since it’s not my favorite genre of film.",

A movie for only the children with brave souls that can handle jump scares, characters that not only look a little scary, but possess voices that are anything but soothing. ProducedI would describe Coraline as a “kid-friendly horror movie”. A movie for only the children with brave souls that can handle jump scares, characters that not only look a little scary, but possess voices that are anything but soothing. Produced by Laika Entertainment, Coraline creates a very twisted plot which presents the theme of “be careful what you wish for”, but does this movie depict the theme in a way which children will learn from it? I believe it does, if the child isn’t covering their eyes and ears throughout the climax of the movie.\tThe introduction of this movie, will have the audience disturbed right off the bat. Hands, with long fingers of steel, intricately ripping into the seams of a stuffed doll and recreating its fabrics to make it look exactly like the main character, Coraline. Coraline is a spunky child who had just recently moved into ‘The Pink Palace’, a three story townhome located in the middle of the woods. Coraline goes outside one day, to be disturbed by a stray cat, and her new annoying friend Wybie. We don’t know where Wybie lives, but we do know that he is forbidden from going into the Pink Palace by his strict grandmother. Wybie states that his grandmother doesn’t allow him in the Pink Palace because his grandma’s sister was ‘stolen’ while exploring the Pink Palace and never returned. Coraline, being the sassy thing that she is, rolls her eyes at the thought of her home being dangerous and ignores Wybie. She then comes home, and experiences her parents ignoring her, because they are too busy hunched over their computers to play with her and is disappointed because her parents treat her like she doesn’t exist. The next day, Wybie introduces Coraline to Mr. B, an insane acrobat who is disgustingly flexible. Soon after, Wybie gives Coraline a doll that looks almost exactly like her. Coraline takes the doll and sets it near her bed in a position as if it is watching her. I believe she does this to make it feel like someone does care about her parents, because her parents don’t show they care about her at all whatsoever.\tLater, while Coraline’s parents are minding their own business, Coraline finds a small door inside of a wall. She nags her mom for the key to this door, and she does, in exchange for Coraline to leave her alone. Coraline finds that nothing is there but a brick wall, a big disappointment for Coraline. That night she finds jumping mice, that lead her to the small door. When it is opened, she has access to a colorful tunnel, that leads to an entire new world! This new world greets her with an abundant feast and new parents. These parents call themselves the ‘other mother’, and the ‘other father’, and they fill this other world with wonders and superficial love and care for ‘their child’. Coraline soon discovers that this world isn’t what it claims to be, only to learn to “be careful what you wish for”.Coraline, is a movie that in our opinion, has many positives and negatives. For example, we really enjoyed the stop motion animation that most somewhat recent movies don’t have. We also enjoyed the parts of the movie that were more uplifting, such as when the other mother and other father fed her, showed her the garden that looked like an exact replica of Coraline’s face, the circus shown by Mr. B and the circus mice, and the dog theatre, where an exotic play was presented by Ms. Forcible. However, this movie did have multiple negatives. The dark storyline will definitely either scare a young audience away, or bore them to sleep. Overall we would give this movie a 3 star rating, because we all thought the movie was weird and disturbing but at some parts we liked how it all connected throughout the movie. The type of people to watch the movie depends how brave they are. Children ten and older could watch it, but little kids can watch it if they are brave enough. I would recommend this movie to people who like a little jump-scary action with a gloomy atmosphere. Coraline’s MPAA rating is PG. The movie has it good parts and it’s bad places, but we thought it was okay.",

It was well put together and each scene was very whimsical. I like the scene in the garden when all the flowers bloomed and created Coraline’s face. One of my favorite parts is when the piano is playing the Other Father and he says something that he wasn’t suppose to say.\tOverall the movie is rated PG and I agreed with that. But, this movie should be on the older end of PG meant for children who are 8 and older because it involves scenes with suspense and then people or things jumping out at the screen. It also includes people changing into different “things” that might frighten young children. This movie had a good overall feel to it but, I would not recommend this movie to anyone under 2nd grade. I recommend this movie to anyone 4th grade or higher.\tRating out of 5:  * * * * * 5 Stars",

Coraline is an eleven year old girl that has just moved to the Pink Palace Apartments. Her parents write about plants and gardening, but neglect Coraline and just think she is in the way. So, Coraline goes exploring, and what she finds is shocking. Laika Entertainment created a children’s movie based on Neil Gaiman’s short story “Coraline” that was a bit different from all of the other animation pictures. But, it was a little too mature for younger kids. The plot was tough to follow and a little too scary for some children under the age of 9.On her first day at Pink Palace she meets Wybie, the owner of the Pink Palace’s grandson who stalks everyone.He finds this doll in his grandma’s trunk that looks exactly like Coraline. She thinks it is kind of weird that they look so alike, but it doesn’t matter to her. Coraline and her parents don’t get along very well so she goes exploring around the house at all the different things and finds this little door locked with a key that leads to a brick wall, but that night when she is sleeping, she follows hopping mice to the door and find it open and not leading to a brick wall, but to another world where everything is the way Coraline wants it. In the world her parents wait on her hand and foot, the food is good, her neighbors are nice and are good at what they do. Coraline also sees that there is a garden which she has been pestering her real parents about the whole time they have been there at the Pink Palace. The creepy catch is that everything in this world has buttons for eyes. She keeps coming to this world and has a great time. But, will it still seem so great after she learns the truth about it?Some things that I didn’t like about it was that it is way too creepy for a PG movie. There were parts in the movie where things popped out and when some of the other characters mutated into different things. Also, they didn’t elaborate on other characters and their backgrounds. The character development could have been better and clearer, their histories were a little foggy. I wish I could have learned more about the Wybie’s grandma and her background. Some good things about the movie is that the actors did really well playing their parts. You could hear the sarcasm in their voices during the Coraline-Wybie dialogue. For a stop-motion movie, the picture overall was very good. The characters had swift movements and it wasn’t choppy. I think this movie should still be rated PG, but I recommend that it be watched by older kids (around 9-12). The plot may not make sense to the younger children and they won’t understand the theme of the movie. They also will be scared and might have nightmares even when they don’t understand half of the movie. The characters’ appearances started to get more creepy toward the end along with the plot, which made it more bone chilling. We give the movie a 2 out of 5 stars , because it didn’t really elaborate on other characters, and the plot of the movie was really hard to follow. It was too scary for most little kids, and because there was no real meaning to this movie. Even with the theme being “careful what you wish for”, the kids won’t catch on to that meaning they will just be scared out of their pants. That is why I think they should have made a movie that incorporates so scare to it but not so much that 7 year old can’t watch it because it will give them nightmares and you could still make a movie that speaks the same theme but in a better way for all the kids.",

In 2009 the movie Coraline was made by Laika Entertainment. I just watched the movie for a school project. The movie Coraline is based off a book made by Neil Gaiman. Coraline the main character is played by Dakota Fanning. The main character in this movie is Coraline and the supporting characters are Wybie (Wyborn), Bobinsky, Coraline’s other and real mother and father, the cat, and the 2 woman that live in the basement. Coraline, a girl from Michigan, has made the move to the Pink Palace Apartments in Oregon for her parent’s job. While the Jones family believed their life would continue to be bland and routine, Coraline opens the door to secrets and a whole lot of problems.  While Coraline wonders the house counting squeaky doors, leaky windows, and odd paintings she finds a locked, knee high door in the family room. Making a deal with her mom she unlocks the door, to find bricks and the door blocked off. With help from mice she’s welcomed into the alternate world with open arms from her other mother and father. The first visit Coraline realized that while everything was the same, one main difference stood out, the buttons on the eyes of her alternate parents. Coraline, continues to visit the alternate world but begins to get a more eerie vibe with each visit. With Coraline’s other mother trying to love her forever, will Coraline give into the other world’s temptations? Some of the things we liked was the stop motion filming and unique story line. The other mother was a very strong character and the movie centered around her and the world she created. I feel like Wybie was a key character in the movie but never fully developed. I also believe that while the main focus was on Coraline’s other parents, there was not enough screen time of her real parents to get a full feel for Coraline’s home life. The characters were played very well by the actors behind them, and helped really tie the movie together. While there were many positives, I believe the movie was inappropriate for the age group it is advertised in. With scandalous content in the scene with Forcible and Spink’s performance in the alternate world and an alarming plot with characters who change for the worst the movie is not as family friendly as it is portrayed.   I would recommend this movie to people who are into an eerie vibe. Parents may want to view the movie before their children.With the possibility of nightmares from characters who change to be creepy and scenes that include jump scares I don’t recommend this for anyone younger than 7. The MPAA rating of this movie is PG, and despite its rating I would recommend it for ages 8 and up. Rating out of 5 stars:3 Stars ***",

Our class all saw  “Coraline” in English class.  We are here to tell you a little bit about it, and what we thought of the movie. “Coraline” is a movie with a hard concept to grasp for most kids. The stop motion in this movie looked very real and detailed.  Laika Entertainment made the movie and I would say they did an excellent job with this movie. The story was mainly about a girl who had just recently moved to Pink Palace Apartment.Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning) is a 11-year-old girl who has just moved from her hometown in Oregon. She moved to a new home in the Pink Palace Apartment. Coraline is constantly being ignored by her parents and while she was sent to look around the house she finds a secret door.  After opening the door to only find a brick wall Coraline went to sleep disappointed. She woke up to find these weird mice running around in her house so she followed the mice until they ran into the door that was now somehow unblocked. She crawled through the door to find an amazing world where her other parents lived. Everything is amazing and she loves to go to this other world. However signs point to this other world being dangerous such as children going missing in the house. Coraline was a very intriguing movie. It kept our attention throughout the whole movie. The animation looks very detailed and creative. The main character Coraline kept you wondering what would happen next as she crawled through the door in the wall, to emerge into a different world. The pacing in the movie was brilliant so you could understand why the main character Coraline would be angry with her situation in the real world. Audiences get to learn about her life through small details such as the picture of her friends.   Although there were a fair share of negative things about this movie as well. “Coraline” had some scary scenes that may not be appropriate for younger audiences. This movie is rated PG, so young children have gone to see it. Through personal experience, this movie was very scary as a kid. We all agree that this movie made sure nightmares. “Coraline” should not be rated PG-13 but it is definitely not for 5 and 6 year olds. We would say it should stay rated PG but is more appropriate for 10 year olds or older. Rating: 4 out of 5 stars",

It was well put together and each scene was very whimsical. I like the scene in the garden when all the flowers bloomed and created Coraline’s face. One of my favorite parts is when the piano is playing the Other Father and he says something that he wasn’t suppose to say.\tOverall the movie is rated PG and I agreed with that. But, this movie should be on the older end of PG meant for children who are 8 and older because it involves scenes with suspense and then people or things jumping out at the screen. It also includes people changing into different “things” that might frighten young children. This movie had a good overall feel to it but, I would not recommend this movie to anyone under 2nd grade. I recommend this movie to anyone 4th grade or higher.",

Coraline is a PG animated fantasy / thriller movie. The producer of “Coraline” is Laika Entertainment. Some main character's voices include actors such as Dakota Fanning as Coraline, Teri Hatcher as the Mothers, and Ian McShane as Mr. Bobinsky. I enjoyed this film but I still have some critical thoughts.Coraline and her parents move into The Pink Palace Apartments and it seems to be very bland and normal, but she comes to find this mysterious place has big secrets behind a little door. Coraline wishes for a better life. Her parents are caught up in their own business and leave her to make fun for herself. While Coraline explores the house she meets her boring neighbors and a bizarre boy who is the grandson of the owner of the complex. This boy is Wybie, he says his grandmother doesn’t usually rent to people with children. He tells her things that leads her to question her new home. She then unlocks the door to a perfect universe. She meets her other parents and Coraline has everything she has ever wanted. Her other mother just needs one thing in return, to sew buttons into her eyes. But what all does that involve, you say? Watch the movie to see for yourself!One thing I noticed while watching the film was stop motion. Some might think stop motion isn’t very good, but in this movie it’s really effective with the plot. The details in this movie are excellent. All the characters including mice and stuffed animals had buttons for eyes. For Coraline, a child that wants the perfect life, this image sure is maintained, of course until all turns evil. I disliked the creepiness and scenes where you see the true side of the other mother.This movie is rated PG. This movie can be frightening to little ones but it doesn’t contain any content to have it be PG 13. I would recommend not taking your little children of ages 8 and under to this mature animated movie. Your child would likely not understand the concept of this film and would have nightmares for the rest of their lives. Some scandalous scenes with grandmas are best not seen by youngsters. These parts are not inappropriate but not recommended for the button eyes of a child. I would suggest that parents should view this movie before taking their kid to view this. I would not refer to this as a scary/horror movie but it does in fact have a very eerie vibe to it.Scale out of 5 Stars: ***",

The introduction is a bit strange so don’t let that sway you. Warning: this movie is CREEPY to young viewers. The story is about a girl that hates her mom and dad. She finds a secret door in the wall and goes through it into a different world that is the opposite of everything she is used to. She gets very comfortable in that world until something bad happens. The main characters include Coraline, Wybie, Mom, Dad and the other creepy characters in their home. The story takes place in the Pink Palace Apartment located in the middle of nowhere.This movie was definitely not one I would watch again. Honestly, it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Have you had long and confusing homework, then when it was finally finished the confusion remained? That’s basically how I felt watching “Coraline”. By the end I had a basic idea of what happened, but no other understanding of the movie. I had so many questions that required some deep thinking to find out. I didn’t care for that, my preference being able to understand what I’m watching. If you like scary movies you may like “Coraline”. I get scared very easily and was scared for most of the movie. My friends that don’t get scared easily have said they didn’t find it scary at all though, so it’s based on personal preference. This movie is rated PG but I would definitely disagree with that. When I hear PG I think anyone and everyone can watch it. I don't believe young children should watch this movie. Children are innocent and get scared easily. Most children would be very appalled while watching “Coraline”. I think the MPAA should have been more careful when deciding the overall rating of “Coraline”. The goal of this movie was probably to scare kids into appreciating their parents. Overall I wouldn’t watch this film again. This was not a good movie.",

The studio that produced it was Focus. It is an animated adventure movie that has many cool effects but also flaws.The main character of this movie is Coraline (Dakota Fanning). Coraline is an adventurous person that likes to explore around her new home after moving to  Pink Palace Apartments. As Coraline is exploring outside she meets a boy named Wybie(Robert Bailey Jr).That gives her a doll that looks just like her. When she starts to explore the house she finds a secret door in the wall that leads her to a place that is as perfect as can be with the “other parents”. Coraline starts to go back every day. But, she starts to get warnings about a dark secret in the so called perfect world that puts Coraline and her family in danger.One of the good things about the movie are the effects.The way they could make the characters do certain things seemed like it took a lot of time to do. Also the concept of the story and how they executed it was pretty good. Another good thing about this movie was the animation. But, the movie was also very predictable and got a little boring as it went on. It’s likely they started to ran out of ideas on how to keep the movie going so it seemed as if they put in little time as the movie progressed.For this movie I would recommend it to people who like adventure, mystery or a thriller. For the age I would say around 8 or older due to scary jump scares and scary characters at the end of movie, inappropriate scenes like not enough clothing on a few of characters you might not want your kids to see. The MPAA rating is PG. Our overall thought of this movie was that is a pretty average. Scale of 5 stars3 Stars * * *",

One night she finds a path through it and she gets into another world. It was so interesting, but everyone had button eyes. We feel this movie has funny characters with great personalities.  Bobinsky is the best gymnast we’ve ever seen, Wybie had a really dope motorcycle, and Coraline led the movie really well .The movie went from happy to sad to happy and even in some parts it was a little spooky and weird.The best part about the movie was when Coraline was trying to escape from the secret door, trying to save her parents from the other mother. The part I didn’t like about the movie was when Coraline was not listening to her parents.We all agreed that this movie is not for little kids movie. It is more for ages 9 and up because it has some scary parts and scary images, some language and suggestive humor, something little kids won’t understand. The MPAA rating of the movie is PG, kids are allowed to watch it but we wouldn’t advise. I think our final thought on the film is a decent movie with a good plot but it got confusing at times. If we had to give this movie a grade it would be a C with 3 stars.",

The movie was produced by Lakia Pandemonium. The director is Henry Selick, and the characters are Coraline (Dakota Fanning), Other Mother (Teri Hatcher), Miss Spink (Jennifer Saunders), Miss. Forcible (Dawn French), and Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane).The movie “Coraline” follows Coraline Jones, an 11-year-old girl as she moves to the Pink Palace along with her parents. Coraline spends a lot of time outside since her workaholic parents neglect her, and meets a geeky and weird boy named Wybie and his black cat who lives with his grandmother who is the landlady of the Pink Palace Apartments. Coraline also meets Mr. Bobinski, the Russian acrobat, and Miss Spink and Forcible the retired actresses. Wybie gives her a doll that strongly resembles Coraline that she keeps with her. One night, Coraline follows a mouse that leads her to the small door that she found that day while exploring and travels through the hole that leads her to another, parallel world. Her parents in that world love her and do nice things with her, unlike her real parents. These button-eyed characters are called Other Mother and Other Father. As Coraline goes to the other world, she is told not to go through the door, but she doesn’t understand why since that place has everything she ever wanted. But the more time she spends there, the more “creepy” things get and Coraline finally realizes that the other world may not appear as it seems.Some of the pros are that it’s able to be more enjoyable at a higher age, something can pop out of nowhere very unexpectedly, and the animation is stop-motion which is not too often seen in a movie. It also has very unique and diverse characters, like a talking cat or 80-year-old show women. The only real criticism is that it can be very creepy for young children, and the plot can be stagnant at times. I thought that Coraline was a little scary at the part where her other mom and dad had buttons sewed to their eyes in the parallel world. The general feel of the movie, however, like how it’s animated was very pleasing to look at. This movie also has a really interesting and engaging soundtrack that can make you want to move to it, or even be a little creeped out, like when Coraline is laying in bed trying to go to sleep. Another thing that I noticed is that strange customs like stuffing dead dogs so that you would not have to part with them. While “Coraline” may have a PG rating, you may want to consider if you would want your child to see it or not. I would recommend that the age groups that should watch it are around 13 and up. The reason for this recommendation is that kids may be scared of some intense scenes like jump scares and creepy events. Kids might not also understand the storyline, for it is very intricately written. But overall, for most people, this will be a very interesting movie to watch for a delicate story yet filled with action.Final Movie Rating Out of Five Stars:\tFour Stars: * * * *",

The movie was produced by Lakia Pandemonium. The director is Henry Selick, and the characters are Coraline (Dakota Fanning), Other Mother (Teri Hatcher), Miss Spink (Jennifer Saunders), Miss. Forcible (Dawn French), and Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane).The movie “Coraline” follows Coraline Jones, an 11-year-old girl as she moves to the Pink Palace along with her parents. Coraline spends a lot of time outside since her workaholic parents neglect her, and meets a geeky and weird boy named Wybie and his black cat who lives with his grandmother who is the landlady of the Pink Palace Apartments. Coraline also meets Mr. Bobinski, the Russian acrobat, and Miss Spink and Forcible the retired actresses. Wybie gives her a doll that strongly resembles Coraline that she keeps with her.    One night, Coraline follows a mouse that leads her to the small door that she found that day while exploring and travels through the hole that leads her to another, parallel world. Her parents in that world love her and do nice things with her unlike her real parents. These button-eyed characters are called Other Mother and Other Father. As Coraline goes to the other world, she is told not to go through the door, but she doesn’t understand why since that place has everything she ever wanted. But the more time she spends there, the more “creepy” things get and Coraline finally realizes that the other world may not appear as it seems.   Some of the pros are that it’s able to be more enjoyable at a higher age, something can pop out of nowhere very unexpectedly, and the animation is stop-motion which is not too often seen in a movie. It also has very unique and diverse characters, like a talking cat or 80 year old show women. The only real criticism is that it can be very creepy for young children, and the plot can be stagnant at times. I thought that Coraline was a little scary at the part where her other mom and dad had buttons sewed to their eyes in the parallel world. The general feel to the movie however, like how it’s animated was very pleasing to look at. This movie also has a really interesting and engaging soundtrack that can make you want to move to it, or even be a little creeped out, like when Coraline is laying in bed trying to go to sleep. Another thing that I noticed is that strange customs like stuffing dead dogs so that you would not have to part with them.    While “Coraline” may have a PG rating, you may want to consider if you would want your child to see it or not. I would recommend that the age groups that should watch it are around 13 and up. The reason for this recommendation is that kids may be scared of some intense scenes like jump scares and creepy events. Kids might not also understand the storyline, for it is very intricately written. But overall, for most people, this will be a very interesting movie to watch for a delicate story yet filled with action.",

This movie is about a young girl who travels to an alternate universe and then finds her “Other Mother” and becomes in grave danger The production was made by Focus Features, Laika Entertainment, Pandemonium.This story takes place in Pink Palace Apartments where Coraline and her parents move to a new house in Oregon that was old and has lots of mysteries. The main characters in this story are Coraline Jones, Mr. Bobinsky, Wybie, the cat, Miss Spink, Mel Jones, and Miss Forcible. She finds a small little door with bricks behind it. One night she finds a path through it and she gets into another world. It was so interesting, but everyone had button eyes. We feel this movie has funny characters with great personalities.  Bobinsky is the best gymnast we’ve ever seen, Wybie had a really dope motorcycle, and Coraline led the movie really well .The movie went from happy to sad to happy and even in some parts it was a little spooky and weird.The best part about the movie was when Coraline was trying to escape from the secret door, trying to save her parents from the other mother. The part I didn’t like about the movie was when Coraline was not listening to her parents.We all agreed that this movie is not for little kids movie. It is more for ages 9 and up because it has some scary parts and scary images, some language and suggestive humor, something little kids won’t understand. The MPAA rating of the movie is PG, kids are allowed to watch it but we wouldn’t advise. I think our final thought on the film is a decent movie with a good plot but it got confusing at times. If we had to give this movie a grade I it would be a C with 3 stars.",

I thought that this was a movie that isEveryone remembers as a kid wishing for a different life, or different parents. The movie “Coraline” is a very unique movie And you can tell that these producers put a lot of work into this movie. I thought that this was a movie that is different from most other movies that I have seen. “Coraline” has a very eventful storyline, it gives off a sort of dark feeling and leaves you in suspense throughout the whole movie. Laika Entertainment also did a great job in casting as well.“Coraline” is very creative and has some very precise details that I found interesting. For an example, the setting, Ashlynn, Oregon was settled around 150 years ago. Look out for a part in the movie where they mention that in the movie as well, you can tell that these people did some serious research. The movie starts off by Coraline (Dakota Fanning)  moving to a new house called the Pink Palace Apartments and she is not exactly excited about leaving her friends behind. Coralline is quickly introduced to some of her next door neighbors. Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.) , the next door neighbor, is a young boy who lives with his grandmother. Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane) , her other next door neighbor, is a retired acrobat that works with circus mice and helps her along the way. The ladies downstairs to her apartment also play a big role in the story. Coraline’s parents ( John Hodgman and Teri Hatcher) work all day for a flower catalogue and they never spend time with their daughter. All Coraline wants is to have a loving family and some nice friends to play with. Coraline soon realizes throughout this movie that there is no perfect family.This movie has its pros and cons. One thing I disliked about “Coraline” is that I wouldn’t say it is appropriate for little kids. There are a few scenes that would most absolutely be scary for them, such as a few jump scares. Another thing I didn't like about this movie is that the storyline is very confusing and I definitely had to watch this more than once to actually understand what was even going on. One pro I had for this movie is that it had a good theme, which I won’t spoil for you. Another thing I enjoyed about this movie is that it left me at the edge of my seat. I had no idea what was going to happen next! I have one more thing that impressed me. The animation is just wonderful. I cannot believe how seamless it is. This certain type of animation is labor intensive and so hard to do, and this movie had great animation.Even though this movie is rated PG, I would recommend this movie to kids over eight years old. Due to some very scary and inappropriate parts. If you are really wanting to have your child watch this, maybe you should watch it first just to be safe. Overall, I thought that this film was pretty decent, but I do believe that it could’ve been better.",

I thought the movie was very interesting It is not something to show four or five year olds. I would give this movie a R rating. Because it contains some strange and mentally disturbing parts. “Coraline” took place at the Pink Palace in Oregon. The Jones family moved into the area from Michigan to follow their jobs. The family just moved there and Coraline hasn’t found any new friends. She searches throughout the house and finds a small door that leads to the other mother. Coraline keeps going to meet the other mother each night. The mice lead her there through the little door. Coraline meets the cat that tells her to never go back into the other mother’s world. She doesn’t believe the cat, and goes anyway. In the movie “Coraline” I really liked the plot. The plot was really different from all other movies that I’ve seen. I also like that this movie was very unpredictable. Another reason why I liked this movie is, the characters were all unique in their own way. I disliked the clay animation. I also disliked this movie because it was a little cheesy. It was also a little scary and dementedI would recommend this movie to 10 to 12 year olds. I think that kids this age would be able to know what is going on and understand the lesson that is told. It includes a couple of inappropriate scenes, and witchcraft. I would not take young children to this movie. I would rate it *** out of ***** stars. Because it was pretty average. Not something I would see again.",

Like when she fell asleep and she went back to the real world. There was Fantastic voice actors that rally fit the part, and there is good animations, when at times I thought it was real. There was a scene when the characters are very undressed which isn’t PG appropriate.

The main character, a young girl named Coraline is trying to find something fun to do because her parents are strict and ignore her. Coraline’s friend Wybie isn’t allowed into the Pink Palace because his Grandma, the owner, doesn’t want him to go missing like her sister. Wybie gives her a creepy doll that he found in her grandma’s car. This particular doll was made to look just like Coraline.

She receives many warnings from Mr. Bobinsky, her neighbor, not to go back. She doesn’t listen to any of the warnings. Coraline finally understands why she shouldn’t have gone back until it was too late.I liked that it taught kids a good lesson; to appreciate what they have- but they did it by scaring you. It is basically an animated horror movie that is not appropriate for young children. They may get scared by the appearance of the villain. There is also a part in the movie where the two animated elderly ladies’ lack of clothes may make you slightly uncomfortable.I think middle schoolers would like this movie because they will be able to understand it better and it won’t frighten them. I would not recommend this movie to young children because they won’t be able to understand it and it will scare them. A lot of parents complained that their children were having nightmares for weeks after seeing this movie. The rating is PG, which is not a good rating, obviously.",

This movie was an animated movie that came out in 2009. This thriller is  produced by Laika, Coraline goes on many adventures. Coraline and her parents move into the Pink Palace apartments. This is where Coraline finds a small door and is given a doll which is an exact copy of her. After she receives the doll, she goes into the door and finds a strange reality. Then one night she goes down and enters the small door and enters the strange reality that is perfect except this world wasn’t as perfect as she thought, then when she goes to bed she wakes up in her regular room and everything is traditional  again. Throughout the movie, Coraline has many adventures, meets new friends and learns an important lesson about life in this very entertaining movie.  What made some of the movie enjoyable is when Coraline went into the second world and Ms. S and Ms. F put on the singing show and are in mermaid suits, it was a very fun scene because, they were pushing each other out of the spotlight so they have it for themselves and I found this very funny.`But what I didn't really like about the scene is that it's not really age appropriate and shown half naked woman. This scene was inappropriate for the PG rating. One thing I didn’t like was how the stop-motion was so choppy. This made the movie unrealistic and unnatural. The movie might have been able to go for PG-13 but that may be a little high. The movie is more towards the age group of 8 to 10 year olds. I would not recommend this movie for 5 to 6 year old kids because it might be scary for them. This movie was pretty good and entertaining to watch so I recommend people to watch it. If you think you’re too old for this movie you’re not. Anybody could enjoy this film.",

Laika Entertainment was the producer of this fantasy/thriller movie. This movie has a twisted, complex plot with many unexpected surprises. It’s quite interesting, but can get boring at times. But, follow along with Coraline as she unravels the mysteries of the Pink Palace Apartments. The movie “Coraline” took place at the Pink Palace Apartments. The main characters are Coraline, Wybie, Coraline's parents, Other Mother, Other Father, Cat, Ms. S, Mrs. F, Mr.B, and other Wybie. Coraline and her family move to the Pink Palace Apartments for her father’s job. On her first day she’s in her new home, Coraline meets a boy her age named Wybie. She doesn’t really like him at first. Then Wybie finds a doll that  looks just like Coraline.  That same night, she gets woken up by a mouse in her bedroom  doorway. She follows it to the living room and behind the secret door to another world, where everything seems to be perfect. Coraline continues to go back to this “other” world. Little does she know, this “perfect” world is not what it seems.One of the things we liked was the doll that looked like Coraline because it was odd that it looked just like her and it made you think that the doll might just be important. Also we liked the “other” Ms. S and Mrs. F downstairs because they were funny and relatable.  The show Mr.B put on with his dancing mice we thought was cool. It showed how odd Mr. B really was. We liked that the “other”dad created Coraline's face in the garden. It made it seem that her “other” family really cared about her. Some things we didn’t like was parts of the animation because it was different than we were used to. We also disliked the way her real parents are so mean. We really didn’t like the button eyes on the “other”people.  We thought they were odd and frightening.\tPeople who like stop-motion animated, cartoon thrillers, or fantasy films.The MPAA of this film is PG. But we believe that this movie is more geared towards older children closer to the age of 10 and older. Our final word on this film is an okay movie.",

The story is to show to be grateful for what you have.    What I liked about the movie was the animation style was impressive because it was stop motion as well as 3-D. I also liked the plot because it always keeps you on the edge of your seat. I also liked the character development. They introduced the characters at the right time.  What I didn’t like was the music that always played because it was really boring and slow. Another dislike was the parents weren’t as important until the end which I didn’t like as much because In my opinion if the parents were more of a big deal it would have been a little more interesting. If you like intense and happy ending movies then this is the movie for you.This movie was rated PG. I think it wasn’t appropriate for the targeted audience. You should talk to other friends that have seen it and ask them if it would be appropriate for you. If you want to take your kid to watch it, you should make sure they are mature enough and won’t be freaked out for awhile.I thought this was a 3.5 star movie. I would watch it again but no more times after that. All in all it was a good movie with great animations.",

She learns that everything is not how it seems. It is so creepy that you’ll wish your eyes were sewn shut. Even the opening credits, in which a mechanical hand is sewing a doll, are freaky. In “Coraline”, a movie based on the book by Neil Gaiman, and directed by Henry Selick, Coraline learns a this very useful lesson. This film is a stop-motion animated movie from Laika Entertainment. The main character, a young girl named Coraline is trying to find something fun to do because her parents are strict and ignore her. Coraline’s friend Wybie isn’t allowed into the Pink Palace because his Grandma, the owner, doesn’t want him to go missing like her sister. Wybie gives her a creepy doll that he found in her grandma’s car. This particular doll was made to look just like Coraline.  Coraline finds a portal through a small door in her apartment, hidden behind a shelf. Through that portal she shall find an alternate reality. She receives many warnings from Mr. Bobinsky, her neighbor, not to go back. She doesn’t listen to any of the warnings. Coraline finally understands why she shouldn’t have gone back until it was too late.I liked that it taught kids a good lesson; to appreciate what they have- but they did it by scaring you. It is basically an animated horror movie that is not appropriate for young children. They may get scared by the appearance of the villain. There is also a part in the movie where the two animated elderly ladies’ lack of clothes may make you slightly uncomfortable.I think middle schoolers would like this movie because they will be able to understand it better and it won’t frighten them. I would not recommend this movie to young children because they won’t be able to understand it and it will scare them. A lot of parents complained that their children were having nightmares for weeks after seeing this movie. The rating is PG, which is not a good rating, obviously.",

Henry Silick’s great casting and screen play writing along with Neil Gaiman's clever book created the very unique and brilliant plotted movie.Coraline and her family arrive at the “Pink Palace Apartments”. After Coraline, her mother, and her father unpack. She is approached by a neighbor named Wybie and gives her a doll that in which resembles her. As Coraline explores the house the finds what appears to be a cloth door sown into the wall. During the day as she settles in she tries to get her parents attention but they don't listen and she begins to grow a bitter taste in her mouth for them. As she sleeps she is awoken by mice in her door and follows them downstairs and through the door in the wall and discovers the “other world” where everything is better and her “other parents” which are the complete opposite of hers now want her to live with her forever. But she soon finds out she should appreciate what she has and accept that not everything is perfect.“Coraline” is a decent movie. Sure it didn’t really stick with its MPAA rating but still they put a lot of work into plot, however but not as much in the soundtrack. Coraline has one of the best plots I have heard in a long time. In the movie she moves into a new house and gets very interested in a peculiar door made of cloth. Unknown the door holds mysterious secrets and the young girl named Coraline learns to be careful of what she wishes for. Coraline’s plot is pretty complex and mysterious and that’s what I like about it. The theme to Coraline was “to be happy of what you have” but in this movie they took that in different perspective. Something in Coraline that I hate is the repeated soundtrack. It’s like they work so much in the inside of the movie but didn’t do as much work on the outside. People who like interesting plots and spine-chilling animations would definitely take interest in this film. Although the film is rated PG and is an animated film, you should check the most recent reviews because the film has caused some problems with younger kids. “Coraline” the movie is one door to adventure that you don’t want to leave. The total rating on most websites and reviews is 4 out of 5.",
