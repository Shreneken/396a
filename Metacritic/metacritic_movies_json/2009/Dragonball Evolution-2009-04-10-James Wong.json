        "May or may not appeal to fans of the Japanese fantasy franchise it is based on, but aficionados of apocalyptic teenybopper kung fu extravaganzas are in for a real treat.",
        "Far more entertaining than it deserves to be, unless you're a 10-year-old boy, in which case it's only the greatest movie ever made.",
        "A popular Japanese manga series gets a pleasing if paint-by-numbers live-action makeover in Dragonball Evolution, which half-heartedly tries to keep the faith for its pubescent male fanbase.",
        "Marvel at the fact that something this trippy made it to our local multiplex.",
        "Nearly all the actors seem to be having a good time, and the action moves so fast that you don't mind when something nuts happens.",
        "The film is crammed with treats for old-school \"Dragonball\" fans, from the inclusion of all these characters (who don't actually do much) to the moment when spiky-haired Goku dons his orange gi. For everyone else, this amounts to another seen-it-before, probably-willing-to-see-it-again distraction.",
        "Director James Wong (\"Final Destination\") and writer Ben Ramsey are utterly blas\u00e9 in their approach to the series' mythology and structure, cobbling together an 84-minute movie that seems to exist only to rile up fanboys. On that count -- and that count alone -- Dragonball Evolution triumphs.",
        "Bottom line: costumed Goku and Chi Chi cosplayers may argue the finer points of this adaptation, but it is fairly dazzling it its own overextended, futurist-teenpulp fashion, and Chow makes a vastly more entertaining Roshi than he did a King.",
        "Just know there's a whole lot more great stuff out there than just what Evolution has in store for you -- namely, the anime that it was based on.",
        "Completely lacking in visual, narrative or stylistic coherence, the film also suffers from cheap-looking visual effects and poorly staged and edited action sequences that will not exactly please the fanboys."

However, there was no escape when it was played as one of those movies they show on international airplane flights.\r I will tell this right now: This movie is not only the worst adaptation of all time, but it's also one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The plot is a hacking piece of horsecrap. Nothing but stolen cliches, plotholes, and few characters (not to mention that these characters don't even try to be adapted from the original sorce, neither appearance or personality). But the action makes up for it, right? WRONG! The fighting scenes are boring and choreographed, and the \"energy\" effects are nothing more than re-colored wind-effects. They even call it \"airbending\" in order to cover their own incompetence. The acting is also terrible. I would elaborate, but merely writing this review is throwing me into a torrent of rage and hate. To think that something of THIS terrible quality can be released in THIS day and age is a complete insult to humanity, and only proves that 20th Century Fox only dwelves into making money by rehashing icons of previous generations. **** you, Hollywood.

In his travels he constantly overcomes his own limits to defeat any opponent in his way, protect his friends and become the greatest fighter in the world. It was a great anime that had many memorable characters and some of the most impressive action sequences on television. Dragonball Evolution on the other hand is an hour and a half of disappointment, watching as franchise that has such an enormous fan-base be ruined, losing all the charm that made the anime it was based on great to begin with.\r Obviously it's understandable for a film adaptation to make changes from the source material, but there is so little here that even resembles the anime that it's based on. It does keep the basic story the same. Goku and his friends are still trying to collect the dragon balls to prevent them from falling in to the hands of the likes of the evil Lord Piccolo. They also try to incorporate various other mythos from the show like the Kamehameha wave, but they fail at doing it well. All of the explanations of the universe and Goku's powers are rushed over so quickly that people new to the series will be lost and loyalists of the franchise will be annoyed at how poorly these mythos are incorporated in the film.\r Also whilst the characters share the same names as their anime counterparts, this is about as far as their similarities go. Goku's personality is changed from being a light minded fool who cares about only doing good and being the best fighter he can be, to being a typical teenage kid who spends most of the film having a crush on Chi Chi. Roshi's nothing more than a generic master who Goku finds. Bulma is just a Lara Croft type character without any of the attitude that made her character enjoyable. The character closest to their anime counterparts ends up being Lord Piccolo, since at the least he looks like the villain that he's based on. Everyone else suffers from worse miscasting than The Last Airbender movie with all the cast having nothing in common with their respective roles.\r It's also a dreadfully made film on a technical level, with director James Wong taking the epic world destroying fights from the original anime and turning them into amateuristic sequences that seem like they were made by a film student. They use a mixture of awful choreography with the fighters moving slowly and fast paced editing where each shot will last no more than a second at a time. Plus for a film with a 45 million dollar budget, the effects really suck. When the 2D cartoon that the film is based on looks more realistic than the effects do, it's pretty obvious that you screwed up.\r This film fails in every way. It won't appeal well to people unfamiliar to Dragon Ball since the characters and story are so generic, whilst being a terribly made mess of a film. And fans are certain to hate it since it fails to recapture anything that made the franchise great to begin with. It doesn't even feel like a real film. It feels like one of those parody trailers you see in something like The Simpsons that spoof how bad Hollywood is at with adaptations got turned into a real film. If you want to enjoy Dragon Ball just stick with the anime.",

So what do you get with this? No really, what do you honestly get from watching this? Nothing! All this does is make a beloved hero become like any typical kid at high school. Right off the bat your messing things up because Goku doesn't go to school, one of his character traits was that he didn't get an education, and that's why we loved him; one of the many reasons of course. The characters all around don't feel like who they should be; it's been a while since I've seen this, and I prefer to leave it as is. What I do remember is that Piccolo looks really stupid in this, and that's really bad compared to what he is in the show. I know he's an alien here and there, but the way they did it here was so wrong, I don't see martial arts villain, I see a goddamn alien from a bad movie. Finally the ape scene, this was just so pathetic. It might have been better if he was actually the size they were suppose to be, but I doubt that would even save this.

By it's own merit alone, it's just a generic, poorly made action film. BUT, the problem is it's source material. Now, I grew up watching the Dragon Ball franchise, and was a big fan of the show, and I still am. However, I do understand it's not perfect. Some of the writing is stilted, the filler episodes tend to drag, and the action takes forever to start. However, the show still has an underlying charm to it that makes it accessible to this day, and still makes it feel timeless, and has lasted almost three generations.\r However, This \"THING\" has nothing of that.\r This movie captures none of the charm, scale, and creativity of the original series. It is a giant spit in the eye to Akira Toriyama and all fans. This is the absolute worst live action remake of anything I've ever seen. The Plot is a paper thin carbon copy of the series, without the sustenance the original offered. The Characters are all either stereotypes of the characters, boring, dull, or even worse, completely misrepresented. The pacing is insipid, even worse then the filler of the series, and goes nowhere. The setting is awful, completely contradicting the point of the world of the series. The Lore is awful, completely ruining core aspects of the Manga and Anime. The effects are laughable. They wouldn't pass for D-Movie Standards in their fakeness.\r But the Absolute worst part is what it does. this movie destroys and makes a mockery of the original series, something held special in both childhood nostalgia, and in generations of people as a beloved show. This Movie completely trashes on the original, and therefore, is a direct insult to anyone who has ever watched it.\r This is my pick for the Worst Movie of All Time",

The one GOOD thing about Dragonball Evolution is that it's a litmus test for Hollywood, who now see how NOT to adapt anime. This deserves a reboot, or an everlasting death, whichever one I don't care. Much of the plot was just thrown together without any explanation, no character development, cliche after cliche, cheesy special effects, and pre-teen-esque comedy. The plot deviates from the source material on many occasions. It was an epic failure and I honestly can't pick out anything of value that was good about it. I'm glad I watched it online for free instead of paying money. With the depth of characters and plot from the actual manga/anime, a reboot should justifiably be at least as long as Watchmen. They really rushed this film, it is so terrible. Fans and nonfans alike will generally have a deep hatred for this film, please avoid at all costs.

As a fan, I shouldn't have had ANY expectations because I already knew how much Ben Ramsey screwed up the story.As well, it's sad Fox was desperate enough for a movie script during the writer's strike, they pulled this one up. I recall reading what was apparently a leaked script, and this movie follows it pretty closely, except James Wong removed the \"trading card game\" from the movie. Yes, the cast were going to play a card game based on what their adventure would be. Don't ask... Aside from the movie being so inaccurate to the series (and the omission of important character while being substituted for useless ones who appear for a mere 1 to 5 minutes max), the editing and acting was sub-par. The movie was WAY too rushed (in my opiion, it should have been the length of Harry Potter.) The acting was at the point my stomach churned. I did chuckle twice during the entire movie. Yes, I counted. The final fight was too short and anti-climatic. The special effects and Shenlong were so-so. In addition, I wasn't impressed at the randomness of the locations, the poorly paced timing of the script, and the \"convience\" of the Fullum Assassins. Everything seemed to easy and cliche.

In Laurent Cantet's \"Entre les murs\", a Parisian middle school teacher calls two ethnic female students, \"skanks\", without realizing that the term in their culture is slang for \"prostitute\". To him, a \"skank\" means somebody who is talkative. Mr. Marin(Francois Begaudeau) gets the benefit of the doubt. \"Dragonball: Evolution\" gets the benefit of the doubt, too, in the scene where Chi Chi fights a doppleganger. The second Chi Chi transforms her namesake into an anatomical one, because now we see two Chi-Chis(\"chi-chis\" from the Spanish), beautiful, to boot. The fake Chi Chi was trying to steal the dragonballs. There's seven of them, but the film title refers to just the one \"Dragonball\", which to me, suggests a mythical creature who survived a bout of testicular cancer. The other ball collectors have self-defeating names, too. Besides Chi Chi, there's Goku(Justin Chatwin), playing yet another version of the \"Karate Kid\", and then there's Bulma(Emmy Rossum), who to my disappointment, never eats anything. Thankfully, at eighty-plus minutes, there's enough time to physically collect just three of the seven dragonballs. \"Dragonball: Evolution\" also stars Chow-Yun Fat, who slums along happily in a comic performance that shows off an unbeknownst funny side to the usually stoic star of \"Crouching Tiger: Hidden Dragon\". He's a bit of a perv. In one scene, he puts a hand on Bulma's knee while they share a motorcycle. He probably notices her chi-chis.",

I really liked pretty much everything about this movie. I liked the new story and how they changed it up a bit. I really liked the special effects and all the casting (except for yamcha) was great. My one big issue with the movie was that it was so short that i didnt feel really connected to any of these characters, other than Goku. If they would have made it at least another half an hour it wouldve been a perfect movie. I wish they wouldve showed more Picolo. I can't wait for the sequel!!!",

However, thisWith the name Dragonball: Evolution, I can understand the creators trying to make the concept more approachable to modern audiences.  You can see this when they made Goku a 18 year old horn dog and making Yamcha a \u201cdude bro\u201d.  However, this was executed exceptionally poorly.  Not only did it miss all the key elements of the main characters, the movie itself is nonsensical.  The movie is campy, cheesy, and poorly acted.  The voice overs are atrocious and the special effects, well lets just say they\u2019re not very special.  This felt more like a Disney straight to TV movie like Luck of the Irish or Zenon: Girl of the 23rd Century.  You can tell this movie was made with no love from anyone on the production team, including the actors.  It\u2019s actually very sad because Justin Chatwin and Emmy Rossum are excellent in their follow up roles in the show Shameless.  Dragonball is beloved by too many people for someone to barf out a script and having the actors phone in a performance.  It shows courage that the writer apologized for this mess years later, but one writer does not make a movie.  The fact that this was even approved shows that no one in Hollywood cared even the slightest bit about transforming arguably the biggest anime series of all times to a life action movie.  This movie failed on just about every level.  The writing, acting, effects, story, characters, and editing are all just a massive mess.  I can\u2019t imagine one single fan was on the production team, because if their was they would have at least spoken up about how this is nothing like the original and is, in fact, a mockery of it.  Instead, everyone kept their head down and pushed out this pile of cat vomit for a payday.  I don\u2019t have a problem with people making movies for money, it IS a business after all, but when your payday comes at the expense of something beloved by so many people is when you know you\u2019ve made the worst of the worst.  It\u2019s universally hated by Dragonball fans, and is even a terrible movie to watch with zero knowledge of the original series.  Stay far away from this, its not even worth watching to make fun of, as its just a sad abomination of film making.",

The movie even surpasses \u201cAvatar the last Airbender\u201d in the awful adaptation category as there they at least try to use the source material even if it is horrible. If you are a fan thisIt is a bad movie and horrible adaptation of Dragonball. The movie even surpasses \u201cAvatar the last Airbender\u201d in the awful adaptation category as there they at least try to use the source material even if it is horrible. If you are a fan this is unbearable as they slap names, themes and tropes from Dragonball onto a movie that is barley recognizable to the source material. I think it is a mixture from teenage drama, fantasy and martial arts. I picked teenage drama firstly not by accident as they made this clear as starting point. Lets start at the beginning: I heard about the awfulness of the adaptation when it came to the cinema and the criticism did not decrease over the years. I was curious about this and finally watched the movie. Dragonball is based on Akira Toriyamas legendary Manga that was adapted to a successful Anime series which is based loosely on the classic tale \u201cJourney to the West\u201d. It follows the main protagonist Son Goku on his journey to find the Dragonballs which grant a wish if you get all together. This is incredibly simplified as there are tons of adventures, lore, characters, developments and arcs to be told. For the movie: In the introduction that already changes a lot of canon source material we are told that 2000 years the demon Piccolo nearly extincted mankind before he was stopped. The story jumps to current day high school student Goku who is trained by his grandfather Gohan in martial arts. I stop here not only because of spoilers but to not anger fans. While I have to admit that the movie has its good moments it is often hilariously bad and has wooden acting. Like I said if you rename a few things I would not recognize Dragonball except for idea theft. It could probably be in my \u201cSo bad its good\u201d soft spot but I know the source material so it is disqualified. What to say about the cast. I don't blame actors for being trapped in a bad movie / script. I think there are great actors in this as I am a fan of Chow Yun-Fat, Ernie Hudson and James Masters. Sadly that could not save the movie. There are cringe-worthy and wooden scenes. Some are unintentionally funny and I repeat it is a horrible adaptation. Also I do not recognize the characters from the source material in a lot of actors. I don't know about the production but director James Wong is normally far better so I don't blame him either with the benefit of doubt. I think I praise the martial arts scenes as those were entertaining but even there I spotted errors. In the beginning Goku is attacked by 2 people with poles. He evades them so they hit each other but I spotted without looking for errors that they changed the gap to make this happen as they would clearly miss before. By the way the scene / fight itself was awesome. I generally like those fights with a bit of cheesiness and say it saves the movie from a lower rating. Overall this is a bad movie. As adaptation it is hardly a 1/10 and maybe a 0/10 but as movie it has some redeeming qualities but not enough to raise it above a 2/10.",
