He's so good, he makes everyone else look bad.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "The good humor bubbles up from a deep reservoir of affection for Hollywood schlock.",
    "The best, surely the smartest, English-language movie of the year to date.",
    "Everything an action-comedy should be. It achieves through parody what most films in the genre can't accomplish straight.",
    "In addition to the marvelous lead cast, all sorts of funny performers show up in cameo roles, including Steve Coogan, Bill Nighy, and Timothy Dalton.",
    "It's not hard to imagine these characters in a straight-faced Hollywood blockbuster. And that's the source of Hot Fuzz's genius, pointing out the thin line that separates convention from farce when Hollywood starts throwing its special effects around.",
    "For most of its running time, it's an enjoyably unpretentious celebration of the guilty pleasure we can take from a stupid-as-all-get-out car chase or from watching things blow up real good. Then, in its final half hour, Wright and Pegg ratchet up the absurdity tenfold and enter the realm of the sublime.",
    "Wright and Pegg are storytellers who weave their naughty bits into genuine characters and a plot. It's a ridiculous plot, but one that's absolutely in the spirit of the films they're satirizing.",
    "Summer hasn't arrived, but the funniest riff on a summer movie genre has already landed.",
    "If you see Hot Fuzz, you'll never again watch a Michael Bay film without howling with disrespectful laughter.",
    "It's as laceratingly entertaining as its predecessor.",
    "Pegg and Wright are armed with an endlessly impressive arsenal of attention grabbers, from witty editing tricks to a wry soundtrack and a joke-packed script that demands multiple viewings.",
    "In the very funny cop comedy Hot Fuzz, overachieving London police officer Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) commits a very British sin: He's too good.",
    "Hot Fuzz is something all too rare in movie comedies: a story rather than a string of disjointed skits, with hearty characters behind its caricatures.",
    "It's smashing fun, nonetheless, made with razor wit and continual invention and far, far fresher than not only Hollywood buddy-cop movies but also Hollywood's own spoofs of them.",
    "A sustained genre parody that's equally funny but (maybe in deference to the genre) much more pumped up.",
    "A British variation on Hollywood nonsense, and as such it's a little gloomier, a little coarser, and a lot more cerebral--oh, and funnier than all the \"Reno 911!\" boxed sets combined.",
    "Since Mr. Wright and Mr. Pegg are essentially parodying self-parodies, they have also smartly kinked up their conceit by setting most of the film in a sleepy village that might as well be called Ye Old English Towne, thereby wedding one of the most irritating British exports to one of the most absurd American ones. Think of it as \"The Full Monty\" blown to smithereens.",
    "The boys (now in blue) have done it again.",
    "At once deeply affectionate and sharply observed: There's never anything smart-alecky about Wright's approach as a director.",
    "The whole enterprise goes far beyond pastiche, wreathing its characters in a film-intoxicated world.",
    "Really, do we need another dumb action movie to remind us how dumb action movies are?...Yes. We absolutely do.",
    "The thrill of Hot Fuzz is the chemistry between Nicholas and local oaf Danny Butterman, who is an action film aficionado and finds Nicholas' stories utterly engrossing.",
    "The most originally funny movie to hit U.S. screens in a while.",
    "A little too long and suffers from a sagging midsection when the level of exposition becomes laborious, but the spectacularly entertaining final 30 minutes compensates for a lot of flaws.",
    "It's a blast.",
    "The best of it is a riot--a \"Bad Boys II\" fireball hurled with exquisite accuracy at a quaint English town peopled by Agatha Christie archetypes.",
    "With Hot Fuzz, you'll just have to settle for semi-hilarity.",
    "A real actioner, generous with the bullets and blood and chase scenes, that simultaneously mocks shoot-'em-ups.",
    "Plays like two films in one, and succeeds on both levels.",
    "It's to the \"Lethal Weapon\" movies what left-hand driving on a country lane is to a freeway chase: pokey, more than a little daft, but with a bloody surprise around every hedge.",
    "It's bloody carnage - or it's ketchup, or bolognese sauce, at the very least.",
    "Deeply nuts and exhaustingly hilarious.",
    "Hot Fuzz deploys the same mix of genre conventions, slapstick and old-school British humor that made \"Shaun of the Dead\" such a dumb-but-good romp.",
    "Hot Fuzz is fun, and it's nice to see all the English character actors who aren't busy in Harry Potter films, but it lacks its predecessor's freshness.",
    "Basically a one-joke movie, and they take their sweet time -- too much of it, actually -- getting to the good stuff. But what excellent laughs they provide in the end.",
    "Though it's no \"Monty Python,\" Hot Fuzz is a clever, over-the-top marriage of mayhem and merriment.",
    "All the action is staged with energy, but it gets relentless without anything really funny going on."

Once you do that you can much better appreciate how great this movie is. I can easily see why some reviews have Hot Fuzz in the mediocre range. That's because this is a completely different sort of film than we are accustomed to in the US. Comedies are formulaic and you \"feel\" when they try to make you laugh, even when the jokes or gags don't hit. This gives the average person the impression that the movie is funnier than what they actually laugh at. Most of the humor in Hot Fuzz is done subtly. There are laughs to be had every minute of this movie when you understand why it is funny. Much of this subtly is hidden in the main storyline itself. Yes, the plot is believable as is the action. Many will say \"that's impossible\" several times. However, the plot walks a very delicate line between being a far fetched action plot and using considerable satire. It's the way that it mixes little satirical bits and other jokes you have to think about with slapstick and mindless comedy that makes it so funny. It's not just about the comedy, though. The action is always entertaining, especially the incredible last half hour. Entertaining and funny all the way through, the film still manages to craft genuine characters that you actually care about. The end also left me inspired more than the typical cliche Hollywood formula. If you take the time to find all the hidden comedic gems Hot Fuzz has to offer, it just may the best movie you have seen, as it is mine. There is more than enough, though, for those expecting a dumb action comedy to have fun. But either way, we need more movies like this. We need more movies made by people who have a true passion for the art. More movies that are this multidimensional and that get all of them right. We need more movies like Hot Fuzz.",

Overall, this movie was humorous, but I thought it spent way too much time trying to make fun of Michael Bay and other action junky directors like him. It should of just made a good action film with loads of laughs. That's where SOTD succeeded and Hot Fuzz failed. SOTD made a regular zombie movie that was \"laugh out loud\" funny. Also, the supporting cast of this film was annoying and no where close to being funny. The only funny moments came from the two main characters, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.

This isn't Talladega Nights or Dumb and Dumber. The comedy in Hot Fuzz is subtle and subversive. The play on the buddy-cop genre is masterfully executed. The masterful editing the crisp and innovative directorial style give the film a slick look and sometimes gleefully frenzied pacing. For those looking for smart in their funny, this is the comedy movie to watch this year.",

Saw it here in Washington, DC with a whole bunch of Americans. As a middle aged Brit, who was a cop in the 80s close to where this was supposed to be set, I didn't think this would translate. But it does. In large part because the movie isn't a parochial UK comedy, its a play on action movie stereotypes of the last 20 years. Great fun.",

[Ed: you mean disagree?] Nine times out of ten I've thought that the metascore and the user vote were pretty dead on, with this film however I just have to disagree. I saw this film during my trip to New Zealand and I was just very disappointed. The jokes didn't really hit half the time. The never ending action near the end of the film just bored me about half way through. I thought, \"Ohhhh I get what they're trying to do here, making fun of movies like Bad Boys. Cute.\" Past that point I was just tired of it. The plot was just LAME. The ending was just plain bad. Again, I understand that they were making a farce of a genre, but you have to make that farce funny or at least interesting. It was only kinda funny and just completely uninteresting by the last 45 minutes of the movie. On top of that, if you have flashing light induced siezures do NOT see this movie. I felt like a camera bulb was flashing in my eyes through about have the movie. The editing was just BAD. I mean, I understand doing that flash during the scenes where the officer is booking people and taking their pictures with the numbers, but they did it for EVERY little thing. It really just gets to you. So in the end, it had moments that were funny, but overall I just can't recommend it.",
