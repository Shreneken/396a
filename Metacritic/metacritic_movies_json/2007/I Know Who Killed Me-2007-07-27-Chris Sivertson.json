  "critic_reviews": [
    "In short, it’s a gift-wrapped part for Lohan, who plays her good-girl/bad-girl role with wit and an air of sly calculation.",
    "An intensely unpleasant killer-thriller mystery.",
    "Lohan brilliantly brings off her double turn and clearly believes in the picture, as do all who worked on it. These things used to be called B movies in the old days.",
    "The most shocking thing about this ludicrous serial-killer shocker, released the week troubled 21-year-old former child star Lindsay Lohan was arrested on DUI and cocaine-possession charges, is that it's the kind of film actresses generally make when their careers are well and truly on the skids.",
    "The film suggests Lohan probably (allegedly) should've gone after her agent the other night, not the mother of an ex-personal assistant.",
    "Much like the ongoing real-world meltdown of its troubled star, Lindsay Lohan, I Know Who Killed Me is a disaster that exerts a perverse fascination.",
    "The troubled star writhes her way through a red-lit pole dance in the opening credits and shrieks her way through a prolonged torture-porn sequence; after those lurid turns the movie settles into an indifferent mystery plot as the cops pressure the girl to help them find the culprit.",
    "Unless you derive pleasure from watching Lohan being tortured, there's no reason to subject yourself to this movie. Besides, if that's your goal, all you have to do is turn on tabloid TV. There's Lindsay's living hell of a life, being broadcast 24/7.",
    "Having broken free of the Disney machine that molded her, Lohan now seems intent on destroying her career and credibility on her own terms.",
    "The truth is, no review could really do justice to the monumental trashiness of this mess; it really has to be seen to be believed. Although if Lohan is lucky, no one will bother.",
    "Pretentious and inane.",
    "There's a fresh candidate in the running for worst movie of 2007 honors.",
    "Sony dumped this sleazy, inept and worthless piece of torture porn into theaters yesterday.",
    "I can’t say I was too surprised by how risible, grotesque, and incoherent I Know Who Killed Me is. But I can’t say I was prepared for its pretentiousness. If the picture has any use at all, it’s as a case study in what happens when the talentless attempt to emulate the inspired.",
    "A gruesome whodunit that's missing more than a few brain cells.",
    "A grisly piece of torture porn."

Tabloid trainwreck Lyndsay Lohan flamed out in a spectacular fashion last year and among the collateral damage was the reputation of this star vehicle, which made a virtual sweep of the Razzie Awards for 2007. Apparently taking his cues from influences as diverse as Lynch (the black humor and surrealism), DePalma (the emotional pitch and film brat references), Cronenberg (the body horror) and Kieslowski (doppelgangers), Sivertson plunges the surprisingly game Lohan into a deliriously baroque, color-coded world of adoloescent anxiety and virgin/whore hysterics. With appearances by Art Bell, a hairless cat, stigmatic twins, a rechargeable prosthetic limb and Lohan's deliciously scuzzy poledancing, it's all here--including the film's unforgettable catchphrase cum motto \"Everybody gets cut.\" Darkly funny, off-kilter, scary, sometimes poignant, always disreputable and sleazy, I Know Who Killed Me deserves a second look, HFS style.

Holes everywhere and makes zero sense. Shame really, the premise has a lot of promise. Preppy teen gets abducted by serial killer and wakes up in the hospital believing she is a character in one of her own stories. So much potential here, but this movie fails to deliver on every level. It wasn't scary, it wasn't sexy, it wasn't suspenseful, and it wasn't entertaining. Lindsay Lohan has become a bad actor in bad movies. What a waste.",

How did you do that???). It completely destroys any tension. The scenes were strung together with the finesse of a high school student on iMovie. One scene drags along a police station, showing \"MISSING\" flyers and all of the cops in the station, only to pan to the sheriff who makes some smartass comment about bingo night as the scene is fading to black. This was the turning point for me---this was not just any average bad movie, this was a clunker for the ages. I won't get in to the twin stigmata crap, the absurd finale, the awful acting, and the terrible script that brought it all to fruition. For all of those who defend this awful, awful film, perhaps you just need to see what a good film like this looks like: go rent Seven. Everything about it is exponentially better. Seriously.",

Directed by Chris Sivertson, has a script by Jeffrey Hammond and Lindsay Lohan in the lead role.At first glance, the central idea of ​​the script seems worthy of a good thriller or horror movie. And indeed it is. The problem is the way it develops its concept. The script is totally overloaded with plot holes and paradoxes. Many people have criticized the overuse of cliche's but... well, horror film industry has literally lived with it since some years ago. For me, the problem isn't that, but the way these cliche's are framed and articulated. They just don't fit. The characters are also bad, don't have a proper development nor any personality. The central character, having two personalities, ends up not having anyone. The film is not clear about the existence of a twin sister, although its suggested. It tries to bet on bloody graphics but fails, and cinematography, sets and clothes opposes the blue and red colors (as the colors-symbol of the two different personalities of the main character), but that gives to the film a far-fetched and almost sickening visual, worthy of a B movie from the seventies. The soundtrack is bad and Lindsay Lohan gives again profs to be a bad actress and a stripper and pole dancer absolutely mediocre.",
