  "critic_reviews": [
    "It is an intelligently written piece that only falters during the finale.",
    "The intersections between sleep and waking, memory, cinema, and the Internet lead to a spectacular battle of titans who spring from the mind's darkest recesses.",
    "Fantasy leaks into reality.",
    "Despite the jumble, Kon's eye-popping, surreal mastery of the Japanese dream is awakening.",
    "It happens to be one of the most wildly (and disturbingly) inventive animated films I've seen.",
    "The brilliant Paprika, directed by Satoshi Kon--a masterly example of Japanese anime, intended for adults--is partly hand drawn, and features multiple areas of visual activity layered at different distances from the picture plane.",
    "A gorgeous riot of future-shock ideas and brightly animated imagery, the doors of perception never close.",
    "Kon's best work yet.",
    "Paprika ain't no kiddie 'toon, even if its thumpin' techno-pop and bubble-gum thrills have the same splashy palette as an episode of \"Pokémon\" or \"Dragon Ball Z.\"",
    "Whatever it is you're looking for - comedy, horror, parades of singing frogs and dancing kitchen appliances - you'll find it in Satoshi Kon's anime adventure, a jaw-dropping feat of imagination.",
    "Someone walking cold into a movie theater showing Paprika might be excused for thinking the screen was having a Technicolor seizure. Fans of Japanese anime and filmmaker Satoshi Kon will simply feel dazzlingly at home.",
    "While I liked the film's aesthetics and its futurist imaginings, its most important attraction is how it engages. Some movies massage you; others tickle you. This one jacks you into cyberspace, involving you psychically and physically.",
    "A film so joyfully insane that it feels like Kon is overcompensating.",
    "Satoshi Kon, whose previous film was the remarkable \"Tokyo Godfathers,\" uses the complex plot as a pretext for joyous psychedelia.",
    "Schizophrenia never looked so good or so mesmerizing as it does here, and Paprika, while certainly not suitable for kids, manages to capture the childlike, helter-skelter chaos and curiosity of the human mind better than any other animated film.",
    "Fiercely provocative, Paprika shames Hollywood’s use of animation as a kiddie pacifier.",
    "It's a great place to visit, even if you wouldn't want to live there.",
    "I can't claim to have followed the story line of Paprika any better than I did \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" but this mind-blowing, adult animated adventure from Japan is half the length and maybe five times as much fun.",
    "We've gotten perhaps too used to the computerized wizardry of our own cartoon features; Kon, like Miyazaki shows us some older ways that can still transfix us.",
    "It's not a film for children, and it's not even something children would like. It's challenging and disturbing and uncanny in the ways it captures the nature of dreams -- their odd logic, mutability and capacity to hint at deepest terrors.",
    "Paprika is a creatively dizzying and visually dazzling allegory about alternative realities.",
    "With its brainy scientist heroine, and surreal, super-kitsch imagery, above-average Japanese anime sci-fi pic Paprika has a better chance than most Nipponese toons of breaking out of the specialty ghetto by appealing to femme auds as well as the genre's core constituency of fanboys.",
    "Paprika, based on a serialized novel by Yasutaka Tsutsui, isn't a movie that's meant to be understood so much as simply experienced--or maybe dreamed.",
    "One thing is for sure: The über-dream is both gorgeously animated, in Kon's shimmering, hyperreal style, and sickeningly scary.",
    "This loopy anime from director Satoshi Kon (\"Millennium Actress\") isn't a movie that's meant to be understood so much as simply experienced -- or maybe dreamed.",
    "It's best appreciated by assuming something of a dream state ourselves and enjoying the giddy flow."

Like a dream, it jumps from one idea to the next, with a loose thread tying everything together. It has a surreal and stream of conscience technique that is sure to make your head spin more than enough. Paprika masterfully draws you in and never lets go. It's a movie like this that makes me fully realize the extent to which animation can go. The best parts of Paprika however are the subtleties that are not so obvious such as many puns and its plays on visuals. I can't seriously find a flaw in this movie. This is simply a masterpiece that deserves to be experienced. The point of Paprika is to be confused and brought to the point that you no longer pay attention to the plot but rather revel in the beauty of the animation and let the movie itself take over you. Don't be surprised if you end up having a dream about Paprika and dancing appliances after viewing this brilliant piece of animation.",

I love anything that has to do with dreams, and this had plenty of surreal dream imagery to keep me interested. Little has been said in the reviews about the characters themselves. Paprika herself is adorable and her scientist counterpart, Atsuko, is interesting in that she refuses to let her playful side out of her when she is herself. The odd interaction between Atsuko and Paprika makes it hard to know where one begins and the other ends. The old man that she works for is good for a laugh (sorry I can't remember names...been a week or two). The cop character is interesting and a good hero figure that we believe in. The fat scientist who creates the device used to enter people's dreams is funny and endearing, but if there were any flaw with the movie, I'd have to say that it was in not establishing enough of a connection between him and Atsuko in the beginning. It would make more sense for what comes at the end. The villains in the film are wonderfully evil. The mastermind is a megalomaniac and his accomplice is demented in just the right, creepy ways. There were shades of Silence of the Lambs in the scene where he has Atsuko pinned down on the table (or maybe it was just the butterfly imagery that made me think of it). The dreams are so brilliantly insane as well as creepy. I wouldn't even say that it's that difficult to understand as almost everyone else is saying. There were only one or two moments where I was unsure what was going on, and I was willing to forgive that because it added to the surreal nature of the film. This was a great movie. Don't discount it because it's anime, if you're the type, like me, who often does that. One of the best films this year!",

Indeed, Paprika has been cited as an influence on the making of Inception. The two movies share the same theme of losing the ability to distinguish between dream and reality. Due to being an animated movie, Paprika might not suck you into the action as the real human scenery does in Inception. However, regarding surreal dream content and plot complexity, Paprika is far ahead of its American successor. One of the film's major topics is the debate about moral restrictions for science. Some critics are of the opinion that certain technologies are bad. Others claim it is not the technology that is to be judged, but what someone uses it for (f.i. the knife is one of mankind's most helpful tools, but it also can be misused to take someone's life).",

They're areas where the repressed conscious mind escapes.\"Not for children or the faint of heart. 'Paprika' doesn't hesitate when descending into a trippy nightmare with it's untamed imagination. It's like an anime comic book coming to life in a Salvador Dali style of surreal. Even the square frame can't contain the madness of the dreamworld. Once the song 'Susumu Hirasawa - Parade' started playing, I knew that things were gonna get weird, real fast.However, not to say the movie doesn't hold any beauty in it's dreamlike setup. All colors and animation aside, the beauty itself comes from the imagination and the amount of detail Satoshi put into the movie, which was mesmerizing.The soundtrack's great as well. It's so full of energy and joy that it doesn't matter if I didn't know what the lyrics are actually saying.I think director Satoshi Kon said it better himself:\"If you look at a dream overall, it's very difficult to discern the meaning. However, as time goes on, there might be certain meanings in the background. Movies that you can watch once and understand entirely -- that is the type of movie that I don't really like. However, if you are able to understand 70 to 80 percent of what's being relayed, and there's still some percentage left that would allow for your own interpretation . . . that's the type of movie that I do like. There might be a certain part that you don't quite understand, but there is a portion that rests in your heart.\" R.I.P",

ThisPaprika is a kaleidoscopic and phantasmagoric animated thriller, a bewildering ride through dreams mixed with more dreams mixed with waking life. Now for some films, if you do not get what its makers are trying to say, it is lost on you. This is not so with Paprika. This is the kind of film one can watch and find highly entertaining without having much of a clue what it is about. The \"Parade of Everything\" is quite a sight for lovers of whimsy and fantasy, symbols and the surreal. While there are various weak points to the film, but there is not much point to mentioning them. Why? Well, when something goes for it on a grand scale, as Paprika does, it is better to watch and appreciate what it does right. Beyond the vibrant images, the direction does something special with the choreography, the movement on-screen. You get this wonderful feeling of animation, everything brought to life by imagination and the mind. So if you enjoy crazy dreams or the carnivale, definitely give Paprika a view.",

TheThis is a slightly eery and mildly sinister anime film - it made me think of the film Inception, in terms of discussions about being able to enter other peoples dreams and the like, plus the fact that its somewhat multi-layered . The animation is pretty decent, 2D but certainly engrossing never the less. Its not really action packed as such, not at first certainly but the plot and the characters are intriguing enough to keep the viewer watching, as I say. I liked the music played in the background at times - quite atmospheric pieces that help you to feel the relevant emotion as felt by the character on screen - unsure, worried, excited/energetic etc.I liked the way lighting was used within the animation at times, with some scenes being almost, if anything, too bright - with bold, vivid colours depicting the many items on the move, having been made real by the power of the dream (you'll have to watch it to see what I mean) and in other scenes, the dull, or dark, urban settings are clearly shown as just that, dark and dim. There is a certain metaphor element to this, I suppose.I thought it was interesting how the scientist/doctor explained the scenarios, the talk about dreams and films interested me and there are some quite gripping moments, when things came to a head. There is some undoubtedly disturbing imagery present at around about an hour in to the film, which clearly justifies the 15 rating/certificate the film carries here in the UK. There is somewhat sexual imagery present, or what at first appears to be so, so be aware of that. Its certainly a quirky watch - a relatively immersive one at that.I would recommend this film to other fans of Satoshi Kon's work - this isn't your average anime film length show, thats for sure.",
