  "summary": "A wickedly dark comedy about a middle-aged neo-Nazi sentenced to community service at a small, countryside church.  (Outsider Pictures)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "When the most sympathetic character in your comedy is a skinhead, you’re definitely on to something, and Jensen definitely is here.",
    "A funny, politically incorrect and, somewhere deep down, thoughtful black comedy, Adam's Apples is the third and final film in helmer-writer Anders Thomas Jensen's excellent trilogy centered on oddballs and misfits in Denmark.",
    "Peculiar but oddly winsome fable.",
    "Jensen tarnishes the lining of every cloud in one wickedly funny scene after another.",
    "This oddball story, written and directed by Anders Thomas Jen sen, whom Dogme followers might remember from his screenplay for the 1999 hit \"Mifune,\" is more than a one-joke concept. Its characters are sometimes cruel, sometimes sweet, but always recognizably human.",
    "This Danish comedy, like most of that country's dramas, is dark, dark, dark.",
    "The movie is one long pose. But it develops into an idea slightly greater than its flippancy. The steady frenzy is whipped into a roux of two reasonably developed characters.",
    "The melodramas that prolific Anders Thomas Jensen has sculpted over the years have been among the richest works to come out of Scandinavia since Bergman's heyday. But no road is without its pockmarks and Adam's Apples may be the low point of the wunderkind's career.",
    "Smart-aleck comedy and spirituality aren't incompatible, but in Adam's Apples they cancel each other out.",
    "Some will see this as a movie about how we're all God’s children. I saw only the misanthropic fulminations of Jensen's runaway ego.",
    "The movie is all surface, loudly clamoring for attention and then losing its voice.",
    "The characters are too cliched to be funny, and Jensen's script can't stay focused long enough to make an impression. Where is Lars von Trier when we need him?"
