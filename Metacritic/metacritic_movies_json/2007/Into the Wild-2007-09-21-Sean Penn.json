    "critic_reviews": [
        "Spellbinding.",
        "Penn's direction is amazingly sharp and intuitive, full of masterful touches that give an epic dimension and scope to the parable.",
        "A genuine odyssey: a journey to self-knowledge.",
        "The beauty of Into the Wild, which Penn has written and directed with magnificent precision and imaginative grace, is that what Christopher is running from is never as important as what he's running TO.",
        "There's a bittersweet quality to McCandless' story that Penn captures intuitively.",
        "To these eyes, Into the Wild is an unusually soulful and poetic movie that crystallizes McCandless in all his glittering enigma, and allows us to decide for ourselves whether he was the spiritual son of Thoreau, Tolstoy, and John Muir, or the boy most likely to become Theodore Kaczynski.",
        "Sean Penn sings a powerful and poetic hymn to America with Into the Wild, his sweeping, sensitive and deeply affecting adaptation of Jon Krakauer's best-selling book.",
        "If nothing else, Into the Wild is a beautiful film. Penn meticulously shot in the actual locations McCandless visited, and Eric Gautier's cinematography is breathtaking, many scenes are framed in such a way as to almost Hirsch entirely, further emphasizing how solitary his trek actually was.",
        "Into the Wild is a beautifully made motion picture and some of the segments (especially those with Hal Holbrook and those that transpire around \"the magic bus\" in Alaska) are powerful.",
        "Penn, in tandem with the superb cinematographer Eric Gautier (The Motorcycle Diaries), captures the majesty and terror of the wilderness in ways that make you catch your breath.",
        "Captivating and multifaceted.",
        "Flawed but refreshingly intelligent.",
        "They are the only misstep in Penn's otherwise sure-footed journey to what he reveals as the heart of lightness.",
        "Penn, one of Hollywood's most famous iconoclasts, must have felt instinctive sympathy with someone who told the whole world in general to leave him alone.",
        "Feels like a lost film from the '60s in the very best way: unstructured and intrepid and free. As a result, it's sometimes a little indulgent and overlong. But, like its hero, it's never less than sincere in its search for truth and beauty, even as it stares death in the eye.",
        "Though the film\u2019s structure may be tragic, its spirit is anything but.",
        "From seductive start to shattering finish, the film is as stirring, entertaining and steadfastly thrilling as it is beautiful.",
        "Though Penn's fierce identification with the protagonist is a key source for the film's accomplishments, Into the Wild succeeds on screen because Hirsch (\"Alpha Dog,\" \"The Lords of Dogtown\") throws himself into the part without reservation, projecting an appealing openness and life force that brings a special poignancy to his fate.",
        "With the whole of America as his backdrop, Penn pulls off his most ambitious movie yet. The result is a beautiful and thought-provoking road movie.",
        "Penn has a real feeling for the stray moments in life that suddenly rush up and overwhelm us with emotion. He also has an eye for beauty in the wilds, of which this film has many. And he's very good with actors. What he lacks is a sharper eye for the wooziness of romanticism, and that wooziness, despite some truly breathtaking moments, infuses Into the Wild.",
        "Penn has often said that he dislikes acting and would prefer to direct full time. Into the Wild is impressive enough to give him license to do just that.",
        "A gorgeously photographed and less intermittently fascinating 2 1/2-hour film.",
        "A big leap forward for Penn as a director and deserves to be one of the most talked about films of the season.",
        "It\u2019s half-crock and half-sublime, which seems about right for its subject.",
        "One such paradox, which Into the Wild doesn't note, is that those who flee civilization more often than not bring it with them. The bus in which Christopher McCandless died is now a tourist destination.",
        "Sean Penn delivers a compelling, ambitious work that will satisfy most admirers of the book.",
        "The character never really comes alive, and I walked away from Into the Wild feeling that Penn was too in love with the idea of Christopher McCandless the free-spirited hero to excavate the soul of Christopher McCandless the lost man.",
        "Penn is projecting heroic qualities onto a young guy who simply got in over his head.",
        "The result is a road movie with a lofty message that too frequently gets lost in its own thematic barrens.",
        "The movie tries its hardest to celebrate the impetuousness of its hero and the exhilaration of his accomplishments. Mostly, though, it just reminds you of the severity of his mistakes.",
        "Penn opts for epic proportions and clutters his narrative with gimmicks. For the most part, it works. What's missing is the perspective and insight that would illuminated the inner dimensions of a driven young man who is preachy and downright irritating.",
        "If nature -- if life -- is as wild and precious as the movie makes it out to be, Hirsch needs to give us something, someone, to watch on-screen. We need to feel a presence before we can take the measure of an absence.",
        "With all the narration and fits of slow motion,  the movie seems like the work of a nervous chain-smoker. It lacks concentration--and with it, the potential for rapture.",
        "Penn's eye for landscapes is stunning, and his affection for outsider lifestyles is tangible. Hirsch, who carries the film on his increasingly emaciated shoulders, performs heroically, but there's an edge missing. The ideal casting would have been the young Sean Penn.",
        "I think the central mistake of this film derives from its lack of irony, a sense it refuses to impart that the world may not be exactly as the zealous Christopher perceives it to be. The film needs at least to entertain the possibility that its protagonist was driven less by high principle than by lamentable screwiness. And we need to leave it carrying some sense of tragic consequence with us. Instead, we're simply glad to be finished, at last, with this annoying man-child.",
        "It's  hard not to feel that Penn is stacking the deck heavily in his favor and losing out on the chance for a more sober meditation on the ambiguity of McCandless' quest.",
        "A murky screenplay leaves most of the humans ciphers, save for Hal Holbrook in an exquisitely calibrated performance as the avuncular desert retiree whose advice McCandless should have heeded.",
        "Sean Penn\u2019s Into the Wild is certainly visual--it\u2019s entirely too visual, to the point of being cheaply lyrical."

The film is filled with conflicts that everyone deals with. Philosophical ideas and views are filled throughout. Why are people so cold to each other? Human adventure is through travel and meeting new people not simply standing still living in society. You see how cold the world can be. But at the same time you see how good people can be without living in the \"American Dream\" with a house and job. The main character has parents that were not happy even though they were very wealthy. This impacted his life heavily and help cause his adventure. With an outstanding lead performance by Emile Hirsch along with an amazing supporting cast. Beautiful direction by Sean Penn and the enviroment is breathtaking while it takes an older style of film.

Both of the perspectives visible in the user reviews--McCandless as fool AND McCandless as visionary--inform Penn's directorial choices, from the retrospective structure of the film to its dense, emotionally complex episodes, each a gem of casting and ensemble acting. Emile Hirsch so inhabits McCandless that it's almost spooky, and, though the entire cast is strong, Holbrook and Keener give performances of exceptional sweetness and dignity. \"Into the Wild\" is, on one level, about a young man who starves to death amid abundance, and so is the story of an idiot. At the same time, it is the story of a man beginning to see the psychic and social costs of abundance and to yearn for a time when enough was enough, a true idealist who walks his talk. His tragic flaw is not his longing for vanished frontiers but his attempt to recreate them in his own mind, believing individual ignorance a fair approximation of their mysteries. Those who have lived in Alaska (or any extreme environment) may ridicule or condemn him, but McCandless grew up in Virginia, where nature is more pastoral theme park than \"red in tooth and claw.\" Moreover, he is exactly the age at which many of us indulge in foolish, life-threatening behavior, as the cost of auto insurance for 20-somethings attests. What's sad is the waste: though his folly is more principled than the average youth's bender or car crash or fall from a Daytona Beach balcony, he doesn't get the second chance that most of us enjoy, the chance to learn, say, the difference between independence and isolation.  Or--and this is for the users who profess simple amusement at the film--the difference between ignorance accepted as a cognitive stage and ignorance celebrated as a cognitive goal.",

It depicts the real-life events of Christoper McCandless, who disposed of his cash, assets and personal belongings and spent two years hiking around the American Southwest before heading to Alaska in search of a great adventure. This journey of self-discovery is both moving and inspiring on so many levels. Such an endeavour is often of no interest to anyone but the individual themself; however, this is a story that had to be told. In this day and age of motion pictures that overkill with CGI, have mundane plots, and no real heart, this film was a welcome breath of fresh air.\r Director and adapter, Sean Penn, did a great job of transforming Jon Krakauer's words and depicting them onscreen. Yes, that's right, Sean Penn. I would have never thought I'd see him creating a screenplay so moving and heart-wrenching. This work is so far removed from anything I've personally seen him do in the past, but he did an exceptional job. He really focuses hard on the main character, Christoper McCandless, and the people he touches and inspires along his journey.\r The movie can be a little slow-paced at times  that's really the only negative aspect I took away from it  but there's always something around the corner that lifts your spirits.\r Anyway, I truly believe this is a film everyone should see at least once in their lifetime. I implore you to give it a shot.",

It is not an awful film, but it never goes beyond 2nd gear. Ultimately I would I have preferred it if it was filmed like a documentary, which would have made greater impact. As a result I wanted it to end, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\r Full Review\rThe first thing you notice about the film is that is positive, is that the photography and setting as very interesting, and well filmed. Having said that once you begin to appreciate the plot, you realise this isn\u2019t surprise, given the fact that the story is basically a journey across America, so great landmarks, like the Hoover Dam, are not too surprising after the first 30 minutes of the films.\r Surprisingly at points there are decent pieces of acting, in particularly the ending, and sign of suffering of Christopher (main character). Likewise Chris\u2019 parents do predict a decent level of emotion, without being seen as over-acting. However, for me, the best piece of acting was performed by Kristen Stewart. This is not because Kristen is by any means a decent actress, or depicts any sense of believable emotions, but it is simply because she is so bad playing the emotional under-age teenage girl, who wants sex. Such appealing acting by Kristen Stewart for me was one of the only bits of the film I can remember, simply because of how bad her performance is. (I watched the film literally an hour ago from writing this review). As a result for me the acting was substantial, but you know it is bad when the highlight of a film is Kristen Stewart.\r For me the best bit of the film is the ending. I won\u2019t spoil it, but basically it is unexpected, and one that is very well depicted, displaying the innocence of Christopher as a character, just wanting to live life free from the restraints of conventionality.\r However for me this is by no means a good film. The main problem for me was the story. It depicts the story of Christopher, who wants to live life free of society, and ends up in his dream land of Alaska, with flash backs depicting the journey Christopher takes. For me it was such a boring story simply because the fact that you see him make it too Alaska which therefore makes the flashbacks for me pointless, because you know any situation Christopher ends up in, he will be fine. As a result for me the flashbacks, feel more like padding than anything else. In particularly his journey to Mexico, when he wants to go to Alaska seems like a waste of time. While they try and make it more interesting and possibly spiritual by having Christopher justify his life through quotations from books, it ultimately becomes pointless.  As a result I wanted this 2 and a half hour film to end. The point here is that you could reduce the film time till about 1 hour and it wouldn\u2019t make any difference.\rThe second thing you will notice about the characters within the film is that the dialogue is too simplistic. This can be seen by how the characters that Christopher encounters, seem to have really restrictive dialogue meaning no matter how good their performances are, their depictions feel limited at best. Such limited dialogue is made worse by how Christopher seems like someone you admire, but not too likeable, yet nearly every character he meets seem to view him as some kind of god like figure, with one character wanting to adopt him, even though he only knew him for a very limited period of time. The combination of forgettable and unconvincing dialogue, in combination with a dull story that was badly portrayed, for me killed any attempt the film tried to make to make you care about the characters etc.\r Henceforth while I can see the appeal of the film, I certainly don\u2019t think it is worth all the praise it gets. It is not that the film is awful, but the high levels of potential with the film\u2019s story, in combination with the film\u2019s constant mediocrity, make this film ultimately forgettable and a film with almost no charm. Whereas bad films can be interestingly bad, this film, for me, is just boring. As a result I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone.",

The lead character is entirely undeserving of the sympathy, respect and philosophical status he is granted. The Alaskan climax aims to serve as an indication of the freedom he has achieved but in actuality just demonstrates his lack of respect for the wild. Meanwhile the justification for this pilgrimage remains as the void between himself and his parents, a problem he has run away from, a problem his sister has equally endured and yet he, not she, is portrayed as the hero. Accompanied by uninspiring and tedious cinematography and a narrative so forcefully littered with imagery that it constitutes nothing more that a painfully transparent attempt to promote the poetic nature of the lead character, this has to be the worst film I've seen this year.",

The film is based on the true story of Christopher McCandless, a young man in search of true freedom. A recent college graduate, inspired by naturalist literature, McCandless decided to travel to Alaska and live off the land. The film follows his journey, from college graduation and is an amazing story. Emile Hirsch gives an unbelievable performance as McCandless but was snubbed by the Academy. I suspect it was for the same reason I didn't like the film, it is unbelievably slow. The story and cast are amazing, but everything is so sedentary and precise, that you can barely sit through the thing!

It's a 2 hour and 20 minute glorification and romanticization of a guy who wasn't playing with a full deck, mentally speaking, who (perhaps somewhat inadvertently) committed suicide in the wild. He died ONLY because he didn't bother to take basic provisions like a map. Sean Penn admitted on Charlie Rose that if he simply had a map, he easily could have walked out of the area where he died instead of dying. But he was too crazy to take a map or basic survival provisions, or learn basic survival training, and thus wasted his life for no reason. His death was completely senseless, stupid and unnecessary. He was not a hero. He was not an inspiration. Therefore this movie has no reason to exist, because glorifying and romanticizing a guy who committed suicide is bad for society and mankind as a species. If you really are desperate to see a glorification of suicide then it's much cheaper to watch the old clip of Dr. Jack Kevorkian from the news show \"60 Minutes\" instead of buying a ticket to \"Into the Wild\".",

The movie leaves you with a distinctly different impression than the book. The book for me was sort of a cautionary tale about romanticizing the whole high minded spiritual view of Chris. In the movie he was an idealist, living life on his terms, and died tragically when he found the TRUE meaning of life, touching many along the way. The book was a little bit more sort of cynical of these types...Nature is harsh, maybe civilization is not such a bad thing...it exists so we don't starve/freeze to death, so quit your whining about the ills of society and learn to live with those around you...running away is not an answer. Maybe it is this interpretation of his life that was needed to get the cooperation of his family, I don't know. At least for me, I left the book with the \"wanna be hippy dumbass over-estimates himself and under-estimates nature\" and you took a sort of perverse thrill in reading about him getting his due. The main actor was ok, but to me didn't convey the character I read about in the book. He is pretty light in the charisma department, but his gig seems to be walking around with a wide-eyed smile and then losing a bunch of weight..ehh. The character in the book came off more 3-dimensional than was pulled off here. Ok movie, but if you are like a lot of people and have this notion of throwing it all away and living an idyllic life, read the book...it still gives you a lot to think about but filters in a certain grim reality this movie seemed to miss. The Movie itself is entertaining enough..you can enjoy it on it's own merits or you could also choose to read the book, but be warned, you will walk away with two different experiences.",

The book was much more focused on how Chris was a loner, wanted to escape from society, and how ill-prepared he was for nature's elements. The movie really tried to make Chris look like a hero including all the people's lives he touched - a MUCH different story than the book. The movie was also somewhat irresponsible in showing someone like Chris who had no whitewater experience going through some very serious white water which in all likelihood he might not have survived had he tried to go through it. The book showed him as a loner kid who hated his parents for providing him with the best opportunities they could - much more than many of us could ever hope to have been given. The movie was overly harsh on the parents. It lost a lot of credibility when trying to make the parents out to be these uncaring people. The movie was inconsistent in that it portrayed this kid as someone who touched many lives, but yet did not want to be a part of society - also inconsistent was someone who apparently adored nature but disregarded the efforts to try and manage open spaces (as he disregards the lottery system in going down the Colorado). The movie does have some great scenery and I noticed a few wet eyes so it must have 'touched' some people.",

The story of McCandless is not so easily reduced to 'stupidity' as so many continue to believe. By all accounts, McCandless was bright, driven, idealistic, deeply troubled and flawed. But what makes his story compelling is the contrast of a modern human being and primal forces. For McCandless' the most powerful primal forces were inside his mind, not the elements surrounding him. We may never know what happened psychologically to him out there in an intensely unforgiving wilderness, but only 22 miles from help. But Penn doesn't try to know. Instead, he celebrates the messy business of being a human being seeking enlightenment. McCandless was committed to finding it in nature, but along the way he found love, forgiveness and friendship.

Heartbreaking, beautiful, frustrating, and true. How sad that some viewers can't accept that some people march to a different drum--Christopher McCandless is not Jack Kevorkian. There is no comparison. McCandless' story is about a young, hurt, hopeful man's search for something greater than himself. And Sean Penn has turned my favorite book into my favorite film. In anyone else's hands, \"Into The Wild\" might have failed--Penn clearly understands McCandless' struggle. His direction is superb, as is his screenplay. There are so many Oscar-worthy performances--chief among them Hal Holbrook's and Catherine Keener's--it boggles the mind. But it is Emile Hirsch's fearless, doe-eyed McCandless that is the heart and soul of this exceptional film. Don't miss it.",

Like the woman in Pulp's \"Common People\", Christopher, at any time, could've returned to his upper-middle class roots, once came to terms with his crummy childhood. Real poor people, however, if you asked them, would love to have a crummy childhood like Christopher's. But because this young man died, horribly, these projected criticisms about his so-called heroism, fall by the wayside. \"Into the Wild\" demonstrates how literature, not just populist music, can influence young people to make bad choices. What's the difference between Silverchair and Jack London if you're the sort of person who turns to external forces as the culprit each time tragedy strikes somebody down prematurely? Since \"Into the Wild\" uses a lot of flashbacks and voiceovers, the depiction of Christopher's death, albeit somewhat distasteful and exploitative, finally captures the isolation and loneliness that this young man encountered. It's hard to watch.",
