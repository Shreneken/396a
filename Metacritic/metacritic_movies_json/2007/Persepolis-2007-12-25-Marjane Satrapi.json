It is through the eyes of the precocious and outspoken 9-year-old Marjane that we see a people's hopes dashed as fundamentalists take power--forcing the veil on women and imprisoning thousands. Clever and fearless, Marjane outsmarts the \"social guardians\" and discovers punk, ABBA, and Iron Maiden. Yet when her uncle is senselessly executed and as bombs fall around Tehran in the Iran/Iraq war, the daily fear that permeates life in Iran is palpable. [Sony Classics]\u2026 Expand",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "It's not to be missed in any language. In a year that has given us such marvelous animated movies as \"Ratatouille\" and \"Paprika,\" this vibrant, sly and moving personal odyssey takes pride of place.",
        "Cinematic poetry in black and white. It also is a deeply affecting tale of the power of resilience and an unflagging sense of humor through the worst of situations",
        "A completely different kind of animated movie that, even more than \"Ratatouille,\" reimagines what the medium can do.",
        "While avoiding specious bromides about universality, Persepolis insists on communicating with its audience, and insists that communication and empathy are the keys to our survival.",
        "The movie sparkles with witty self-awareness.",
        "If \"Ratatouille\" taught the world that rats have feelings too, Persepolis teaches the same thing about the people of Iran, who in the current political climate are probably in greater danger of being eradicated.",
        "While so many films about coming of age involve manufactured dilemmas, here is one about a woman who indeed does come of age, and magnificently.",
        "Persepolis, the superb film based on Satrapi's graphic memoirs of the same name, is a riveting odyssey in pictures and words. It's unlike any journal you've read or any animated movie you've seen.",
        "Fascinating memoir of coming of age in Iran.",
        "The two main points Persepolis makes are that strife is relative, and all politics are personal.",
        "In a stroke of voice-casting genius, the voices of Marjane and her mother are provided by real-life mother and daughter Chiara Mastroianni and Catherine Deneuve, respectively, both of whom bring heft and measured emotion to the characters.",
        "This autobiographical tour de force is completely accessible and art of a very high order.",
        "Persepolis is a small landmark in feature animation. Not because of technical innovation--though it moves fluidly enough, and its drawings have a handcrafted charm forgotten in the era of the cross-promoted-to-saturation CGI-'toon juggernauts--but because it translates a sensitive, introspective, true-to-life, \"adult\" comic story into moving pictures.",
        "The filmmakers were right to believe that a live-action version of this story would have failed to achieve the universality Persepolis does.",
        "Persepolis, austere as it may look, is full of warmth and surprise, alive with humor and a fierce independence of spirit.",
        "A dazzlingly smart and entertaining animated feature by Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud, looks like a black-and-white graphic novel come to life.",
        "Satrapi\u2019s parents ship her off to a French school in Vienna, but she\u2019s rudderless, ungrounded. She\u2019s drawn back to a devastated Tehran, where she can\u2019t design a life, either. This great film, by Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud, is that life, designed. It freed her mind; it frees ours.",
        "Though you might have a hard time discussing some of the film\u2019s verbal descriptions of torture with young ones, Persepolis will prove a worthwhile movie for thoughtful teens.",
        "The black-and-white animation won't dazzle your eyes, but everything else about Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud's adaptation of Satrapi's graphic comic book series Persepolis will hold you in its thrall.",
        "The French-language voice cast is first-rate, although the film will also be released in the U.S. in an English-language version featuring Sean Penn, Iggy Pop and Gena Rowlands in addition to Deneuve and Mastroianni.",
        "Persepolis is as modern as tomorrow's headlines and as classic as an ancient myth.",
        "They're both tales of growing up in the shadow of Islamic fundamentalism, but Persepolis is everything \"The Kite Runner\" is not. It's a personal memoir rather than fiction, coolly observant instead of melodramatic, female rather than male in sensibility and sense of humor - it has a sense of humor.",
        "Without significantly changing the books\u2019 content, they bring in a wealth of emotional tones--particularly a playful, wry humor.",
        "You can learn about the grand shifts of history from Persepolis, but you learn about a handful of lives as well.",
        "A familiar story set in an unfamiliar context, it's a paean to the universality of human experience, a testament to the endurance of individuality during great political and fanatical upheaval, and a reminder that even the most complex situations, identities and stories are heartbreakingly simple.",
        "The movie, while no fun, faces hard truths and asks hard questions.",
        "The combination of pen, ink and geopolitical strife have yet to yield anything quite like it.",
        "The monochrome animation is stark and beautiful, and Marjane\u2019s an appealing narrator. Often hilarious, sometimes tragic, this may be low-tech, but it\u2019s high-class.",
        "It is a vivid, at times heartbreaking, portrait of a life and a nation in crisis.",
        "It's striking how much emotion Satrapi is able to convey through blocky drawings.",
        "There is no denying the boldness of Persepolis, both in design and in moral complaint, but there must surely be moments, in Marjane\u2019s life as in ours, that cry out for cross-hatching and the grown-up grayness of doubt."

As beautiful as 'Up' and 'Toy Story 3' may be, they do not teach us about the world things we haven't known before. 'Persepolis' gives us a tangible example of the diversity of cultures, ways of thinking and acting and how someone may be found to be living in the wrong place.I do not believe that this is an anti-Iranian film, after all, one of the \"takeaway points\" of the film is to be proud of who you are - which the director/author clearly is, and she makes it a point of pride. However, politics in Iran are definitely under attack here - but why not? Just because it is an animated film does not  mean it cannot contain messages: clearly, what was happening in Iran at the time of the Islamic Revolution was not right, irrelevant of whether one believes it is 'anti-Iranian' to think that way or not. And, I think, most importantly, it shows to world-audiences (and especially US audiences) that Iran has also people who are like themselves, just that one cannot express it openly, and that Iran used to be quite a \"normal\" place before the revolution - not unlike Europe or anywhere else in the 'developed' world.Definitely, it is a highly recommendable film for its artistry and its heart-wrenching story.",

It's main focus of course is the life of a young girl as she grows up from the traumatic experience of the Iranian revolution. As a whole the movie works remarkably well, it doesn't try to preach about how bad/difficult it was to be in Iran during the time, but rather shows how the main character thinks about it. Speaking about the main character, this is such a great character; in fact they fell like real people. She has the aspects of an average everyday person, she's curious, she can be bratty, she has common interest, and goes through problems that others go through to. The main character is probably the best part of the movie, but I would say that the second biggest compliment I would give is the animation. It's definitely a unique style, using black and white as the main visual color. Usually color can express emotions for a scene, but this movie makes to odd decision to show color only in the present day scenes. It isn't a detriment to the film though, so I guess it's okay. I guess that my only problems I have is perhaps the ending, I just don't it. Is it that she now accepts her origin of being Iranian? I don't know. Also the swearing; at times effective, is a bit harsh or just arkward in certain scenes. Like when the grandma keeps talking about balls throughout the film, it's just doesn't seem to fit and isn't really that appropriate. That aside, this is a marvelous film, one of the best animated movies out there; especially one that is overlooked, give it a look.",

It might not be groundbreaking in animation but there was a lot of creativity put into this. Of course, you can't help but get tied into the struggle of Marjame because we are shown such a realistic character. Marjame's interpretation of the world around her is put to the forefront instead of the political struggles in Iran. I would agree that it felt a bit like a series of diary entries but thankfully introspection is kept to a minimum and we are allowed to simply witness the events in her life more. It was a good mix between being on the outside looking in at Marjame's struggles and being on the inside looking out. The moral here is that no one when presented obstacles in life is perfect and there is nothing you can do to make things better. It may have been a typical coming of age story in some aspects but it was also this realization that no matter what, you can never truly identify with a world that can't really identify you. More likely, you will have to fabricate your own identity like Marjane had to. This is not one to miss. It couldn't have been better presented.",

After a while, we feel less sympathetic with the rather self-absorbed main character. The animation is very nice, and perhaps a new and interesting way to tell an elaborate and long historical story without having to go to the trouble and expense to re-enact it all. The graphic style is very evocative of the psychological and cultural territiory in ways that modern 3D computer animation could not. Sadly, the material becomes quite split after awhile, partly personal issues of a pretty mixed up young girl, partly epic family tragedy in a warring country. They don't mix particularly well, and after a while I began to wonder why one or the other was not more emphasized, and why would I want to watch both at the same time? Oddly, the animation seemed more interesting and fitting to the war and historic segments, and a decent young women's movie could've been made in a conventional method. I would want to see the historical movie, and would've skipped the other.",

While \"Shrek\" gorges himself on Bambi and all his forest critter friends, filmmakers like Satoshi Kon(\"Paprika\", \"Tokyo Godfathers\") and Sylvain Chomet(\"Les Triplettes de Belleville\") continue to work in the cel tradition. \"Persepolis\", however, could be said to have precious little, if any, of \"Steamboat Willie['s]\" DNA. Like Jessica Yu's \"In the Realms of the Unreal\"(the 2004 documentary about outsider artist Henry Darger), \"Persepolis\" takes static imagery(in this case; the illustrations from a graphic novel, in the Yu film; Darger's paintings) and transforms them into a meditation on kinesics. The results are truly startling; Iran and France rendered in a phantasmagorical world of black and white. The intermittent use of color is used to differentiate the past from the present, but it's also a commentary on how Marjane's life in her homeland and adopted home covered the full breadth of experiences in both geographical instances. Don't readily assume that Marjane's life in Iran was all bad, and her move to France was all good; only our president sees things in terms of black and white. Our president, our country, in which \"Persepolis\" sneakily characterizes as being the devil, and the devil's lair. Marjane(voiced by Chiara Mastroianni) listens to Iron Maiden, a band from Sheffield, England that purportedly worships the devil(well, they did release an album entitled \"The Number of the Beast\"). In other words, Great Britian is in cahoots with the United States, or, \"the devil\", as we are known to our international neighbors.",
