  "summary": "Requiem is the continuation of the Aliens vs. Predator series based on the graphic novels.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem is a B movie that truly earns its B.",
    "It may not be classic sci-fi like the original “Alien,” which it has in its DNA, but it’s a perfectly respectable next step in the series.",
    "Provides enough cheap thrills and modest suspense to shake a few shekels from genre fans before really blasting off as homevid product.",
    "Chopped down to 40 minutes, this could be a wickedly cool short; as is, it’s a passable slasher that’s still nowhere near the interspecies smackdown we geeks have long imagined.",
    "A dull actioner that looks like a bad video game.",
    "Aliens vs. Predator -- Requiem simply exists, nodding to the continuity of the larger series and opening the door for, yes, another entry in the franchise. In Hollywood as in outer space, spawn begets spawn.",
    "The film's major draws are R-rated gore and some nice physical effects, proof that a man in a top-of-the-line monster suit can still be more effective than CGI.",
    "An orgy of mindless violence, a random collection of bloody bodies, alien misanthropy, and slobbering carnage designed to bore straight into the pleasure centers of 13-year-old boys and leave the rest of us wondering when the movies got so damn loud.",
    "--- \r\nHo, ho, ho - the joke's on anyone who pays to see this.",
    "It's unclear whether any of the actors here have promising political careers since their only purposes are to serve as prey, adversaries and involuntary incubators to their guests.",
    "The camerawork is a smidge too shaky and the lighting/color design too dark for me to relish the Predator-on-Alien butt-kicking.",
    "An early but strong contender for worst movie of 2008.",
    "The problem with the \"Alien vs. Predator\" series is that the humans keep getting in the way.",
    "A tasteless, witless, mindlessly perfunctory bloodbath that has the discourtesy to take itself seriously. Pitting aliens against predators may be the height of frivolity, but God forbid anyone have fun with it."

This movie is actually good and as much as I would like to rag it, I can't because the movie gives no cause to do so. This movie is an action-packed science-fiction thriller in which the humans are completely superfluous except when they get in the way of the humanoids who have made earth their battlefield, and there's nothing the humans can do about it. NOTHING! This may be the first sci-fi movie in which the humans are completely helpless and rendered incapable of fighting back. In other words it's an original story, and it's the humanoids who are the stars.",

I'm probably being a little biased by giving it a 10 but it blew AVP 1 right out of the water. And Yes I too am a huge fan of the first AVP film. OK sure there are moments in the film that seemed unrealistic. However, personally I was still scared out of my wits while watching it.",

The opening was sheer brilliance, i loved looking inside the ship and life of these Predators because we have not seen this in any of the films.The characters are kind of lame but if they aren't brought into the film as soldiers what can you do? Nothing. Just watch them die at the hands of these alien killing machines.The scenes on which each alien/human interaction is shot is awesome, i loved the underground stuff and the above ground action scenes are just as good! This is made possible by the most seamless use of 3D graphics tied into the real-life filming.To conclude, this movie rocks. It incorporates every aspect of the Alien & Predator franchise, as well as introducing many new techniques during action scenes. The action is 100% gut wrenchingly sick and AWESOME.I truly recommend this film to any fans.",

I have waited for this one all year and wow, what a movie. This could be interpreted as a direct rip off of Aliens, with brief moments of Alien3 and Alien resurrection, or paying homage to the classics that came before it. I say Aliens in particular, as you will see when you watch it. It also has the feel of the original Predator, right down the original music. If you want a bad arse predator back, not one that teams up with people!! and relentless, murderous, hard core aliens swarming the town, this is the movie for you. This left me wanting more. Let's hope the studio can see that these classic movies should now be reinstated in their own right. Bring on Predator 3 and Alien 5",

It was every thing I expected it to be and better1! One Predator against millions of Aliens and a PredAlien, which looked awesome by the way! It set itself apart from the first movie when both the father and 8 year old son get face hugged! Plus the killing of newborn babies in the hospital (You don't see it) and how the PredAlien inserted FOUR embryos down the throat of the woman was... It was like every fan across the world got together to make a good Alien Vs Predator movie! I didn't acknowledge the little plot holes; i just turned my brain off and watched the film, and I'd suggest you do the same!!Overall, 10-10! Well done!",

AVPR didn't quite have the actors fans or other movie watchers would of liked but they did a much better job than the actors in AVP in my opinion. Each of the characters were more interesting then the AVP ones, even if the actors in AVPR weren't the greatest. Other than the actors AVPR was filled with great action sequences, Daniel Pearl did a great job, Brian Tyler's score could of been more intense and action based but other than that the movie kept me entertained.So overall I'd say Aliens vs. Predator Requieum was a big success over AVP and all Alien and Predator fans should see this film because I believe it gives the creatures what they deserved from the beginning.",

The mayhem was overwhelming, and just what it would be during an infestation by Aliens. Throw in the Predator for cleanup measure, and it magnifies the Wow factor by ten. As with every movie, I expect license to be taken from prior franchisees. And I don't have to have perfect storyline flow from one source to the next. As long as there are no major screw-ups, we charge ahead like was done here. Full steam, and available for future sequels.

I will admit that some scenes were a little tasteless, especially the 8 year old boy and the maternity ward scenes, but the tie-in to the other Alien films at the end made it worthwhile. Plus, it is the first time since Aliens that I actually felt tension in the rest of the audience, and my brother-in-law told me that in several scenes he thought he was going to rip the armrest off of the chair because he was gripping it so tight.

It was scary, disturbing but somewhat believable too. Hard to describe without spoilers. Long story short. If you enjoyed Alien movies and predator movies. You should like this movie much better than the last one. I was so, disappointed in the 1st AVP so the only reason I went to see this was because my son wanted to see it. I was happily surprised. The only thing though that bothered me was that before in scary movies (even if this doesn't fall under the category of scary) they left out children and pregnant women. This isn't the case in this movie. If this would be something that would disturb you - this may not be the movie for you. Logistics part though - if you think about this on a species level... a species looking to take over wouldn't hesitate for a child or mother-to-be. All together... a great movie. I hope that they leave it alone and end this title on a good note and not ruin it with endless bad additions to the series.",

The actors that played the aliens and predator did it really good and they should play them again if there are future sequels.

This movie makes \"Highlander 3\" look passable. I rate it a 1 merely because a zero might be taken to mean that there was no thought in my rating this movie. The acting was wooden, the action was ridiculous, the story was garbage. Many of the ideas stolen from the previous films are now clichés. AVPR could be aptly named \"Alien Movie\" and promoted in the \"Scary Movie\" franchise. I loved Alien & Aliens, and loved Predator as well. They were great movies by great directors. These directors knew that suspense is better created when you don't show the Aliens/Predator early in the movie. Why not make the audience wonder? Maybe build up the fear? As far as I'm concerned, only two Alien movies have ever been made, and only one Predator. This movie was bad on whole new levels. It didn't only get bad as it went on. One might go so far as to say that it was geometrically bad! It was bad in every direction at once, and every direction spilt into multiple new ways of badness, and so forth, and so forth. The only suspense keeping you in the theater was wondering how they could possibly make it worse! Don't worry! They can... and they did! There's no real way I could possibly convey how bad this is with words. You truly have to see it to understand. In terms of knowing a bad movie when you see one, this movie will destroy your innocence. As much as I love the first two Alien movies, and the first Predator movie, please Hollywood, please let this die now. There will NEVER be another Alien or Predator movie that can not only live up to the first ones, but that can overcome the embarrassment of this one. Please let these die. They have no dignity.",

To me, this movie is like a combination of Aliens and Predator. This movie was jam-packed with action, gore, and plenty of violence! Basically what happens is, that the movie starts where the original AVP left off. The Predalien bursts out of the predator 'Scar' and kills the other predators on their ship, causing it to crash in the Colorado woods. A father and son hunting nearby, come to investigate and end up getting attacked by some face huggers that escaped the wreckage. Back on the Predator home world, a truly bad-ass predator receives a distress signal from the down ship and gears up to go and clean up the mess. The next few scenes are basically getting to know the main characters and their stories. People start to go missing and soon, the predators and aliens and predalien, duke it out in an underground sewer system, take the battle to a power plant, a restaurant, a store (where the few main characters are hold up), a school, a hospital, and finally, the big roof-top battle. My favorite scenes were definitely when the predator stalks the people in the forest, and all the scenes in the hospital. This movie had everything I had hoped an AVP movie would have, and more! There were only two tiny things that i thought were wrong. This movie is very dark, lighting wise, and sometimes I thought that some of the fights were a bit too dark, so that you couldn't really see much of what was going on. It wasn't that big a deal. Another thing, which both AVP movies have in common, is timing. They go by two fast. Or at least the beginning of this one did. One thing they should do to try and fix that is going back to the way that the original films started up. Slow and calm, like Alien. I think that would help with timing and maybe get these movies a little more paced and suspenseful. If you haven't already seen this movie, then I recommend seeing it as soon as possible, because you will love it, whether you are a fan or not!",

After marks set by Alien and Aliens, all movies afterwards including Alien 3 were gradually worse. Alien Resurrection was catastrophe and especially AVP 1 was insult to all us Alien fans. Lacking good story and believable characters, any sense and respect to Alien history and background, too depressive or cartoonish, to me it was just plain waste of time and energy. I thought that it was finished with Alien series. However when I saw that there would be one another movie in series I decided to give it a shot and watch it. As I had so much bad experience before, my enthusiasm was low and I was skeptic and pessimistic about film prospects. When I started watching movie however this has started to gradually positively change and by the end of film I was really pleased by movie experience, for the first time after Aliens movie! Story is interesting, characters are fine, action is furious, and Aliens, Predalien and Predator are tough and believable again. One of the best scenes are in the restaurant and in the hospital, level of horror and lighting is really masterfully planned. I need to mention and military ambush scene and town gathering that also give good atmosphere in film (did anyone wondered how defense would be organized by colonists on LV426?). Ending also leaves us with questions, like did someone in top government already know about xenomorph existence? Bad things: dialogs are sometimes dull and shallow, some action scenes could be executed better by my opinion.

You watch a lone Elder/Master Predator trying to contain an alien infestation in a mountain town. This isn't going to make you think when it ends, it's not going to change your life. It is going to entertain you for an hour and half or so. You people need to understand that every piece of film is made for different purposes. You can't compare something that obviously wasn't made to be complicated to something that was.Some 'spoilers'I've read that these aliens were altered genetically by the predators to have a lightning fast gestation rate; so that's the 'a wizard did it' explanation by the writers. There should have been more scenes on the Predator homeworld showing their culture, women, etc. The predator xenomorph (people are calling it the 'predalien', so I guess they should call the others humaliens) was hard to make out during some scenes because the lighting and the zoom on the camera. What else? The acting was to be expected, same with choice of characters. I would have liked it better if the Predator either recruited the humans or at least have tried to communicate with them.Basically, as I've said, this movie was made to be entertaining, and it is. If you are having a lot of people over who end up talking during movies, this is the one to watch. You're not going to miss anything important to the story and those kinds of people won't have their attentions wandering.

Not a complaint it just doesn't make sense. But the action in this film is tight, when the predator accidentally kills the hot blonde is one of the best scenes in a slasher film. The pool scene is creepy and the hospital scene is so disturbing its great. People complain about it being too dark, but then people also complain about movies when you can see the monster and it's no longer scary. AVP: Requiem is a great film and I'm sad we never got more of these. Anyone who hates this and likes The Predator is an idiot. I'd watch this anyday out of the year instead of the The Predator.",

BTW fellows, if your wife wants to have another child and you ain't thrilled with the prospect, take her to see this movie. Even as a long time fan of the Alien franchise, I found the nursery scene to be a bit unnerving!Touching on the weak points first, aside from the absence of plot, there were a couple of other things that I have to pick on. First off, since when did the gestation for the Aliens get so short? In the last two AvP movies, it looks like minutes instead of hours or even days like in the original Alien movies. Two, other than Alien fodder, why were such useless characters like the Blond girl, the Stoners, and the Careless Guy, put into this movie? It was obvious from the moment they stepped on screen (and from the trailers) that caring in any way for those characters was going to be like getting to know the Red-Shirted Ensigns from Star Trek!But, as I indicated by the rating, there is more to like than to dislike. There are a few \"shadow\" scenes that vaguely reference the other movies in the Alien and Predator franchises: The Predator \"praying\" over a fallen comrade (Predator 2); an Alien \"examining\" a potential victim (Alien 3); the Predalien peering through the medical curtain at it's next victim (Alien 3); an Alien plays fish in the town swimming pool (Alien Ressurrection); the Aliens scream, screech, and move like the ones from Aliens. The action scenes were perfect, and I actually found the tension building and the heartbeat hastening during the earth-shattering final confrontation! Also, the way the Predator showed off his hunting skills, which were far superior to any of the Hunter's we have seen before, made you almost want to cheer for the him.I don't know if there will be another movie in the Alien, Predator, or AvP franchises, or even if we need another movie, but AvP Requiem is a fine addition, worthy of it's name.",

The terror of the alien invasion tactic is amazing to watch, and Predator culture is as badass as ever.The fights are very epic... far better than the first avp movie. The sets showing aliens infesting human territory are excellently done, more like in Aliens. Also, unlike in Transformers, the use of human and military characters doesn't interrupt the real focus we're here to see: aliens and predators causing terror and destruction! That said, a few things are understated and some impacts could've been more brutal, but the action is in many cases easily better than many recent action movies.The real gold under it all was that I was intensely satisfied by the expansion of the epic mythology built up through each Alien and Predator movie so far, as well as in the AVP games and novels. It was epic to see the beginnings of the Wayland-Yutani Corporation taken a step further (it appears in Alien and Aliens, and remember the Weyland corporation that starts the search for the temple in AVP1?) Also there's some internet joke references that are like icing on the cake (admiral ackbar, Schwarzenegger quotes).I was really satisfied overall and hope more movies are like this, it could be the revival of the true Hollywood action blockbuster.",

The human characters may have been 2 dimensional, but who really cares? After all, the title is 'Aliens vs Predator,' not 'Gunnerson, CO, A Love Story.' From reading previous posts, you all know the story and how it goes. The first movie was about the Predator's hunting the Aliens as a right of passage, earning the right to wear shoulder cannons. The addition of the Weyland Corp. discovering the temple in the Antarctic was a good story arc.This time around, there's the Alien/ Predator hybrid to tangle with from the first movie. Before there is any argument over whether or not the alien takes on the characteristics of its host, I'll remind you that the alien did in the 3rd movie - it burst out of a dog, if I recall correctly, and ran after Ripley and the prisoners on all fours, like it's host would. (My inner nerd/ geek coming out, here)Another poster mentioned the showing of the hybrid in the nursery to imply it ate the human babies before shoving little baby aliens down the throats of pregnant women, as being \"too over the top.\" I don't recall the aliens having a soul or regard for human or other life; just being the perfect killing machines that they are. Engineered and bred to kill and they do in spades in this film.I did root for the Predator, and always will, because unlike the aliens, they do have a code. In Predator 2, he was about to kill a woman cop until he discovered she was pregnant. He let her live unlike the aliens in this movie as I mentioned above. Here, we see that he's portrayed much like Harvey Keitel's character of \"The Cleaner\" in 'Point of No Return' (remember when he dissolved the targets in the fountain using acid?) or 'Pulp Fiction.' He doesn't care how the mess got created, he's just there to clean it up as best he can and leave no traces. Like my Drill Instructor always said - \"We were never here.\"Why I gave it a '9' out of 10? First was the lighting - too dark; what's wrong with using dimmer light? Have it take place at dusk or dawn, or something? Another was because this Predator was bad ass from the get go; taking on 5 aliens at once isn't an easy feat, but from the sight of his trophy room it's clear he's accomplished and more than capable of handling his task. However, I was let down by him taking one of his shoulder cannons and turning it into a pistol. That cheapened his image for me, because I felt the Predator to be like a ninja type hunter and not have to resort to something that crude. I suppose as maybe a last resort, but still it didn't sit right with me.The ending I felt was rushed, but it had the same feel as the 'Resident Evil' franchise; giving it a mediocre ending to leave wide enough room for a sequel.IMO, the human characters just got in the way. Perhaps a better installment to appease everyone would be to leave out the human characters, and have us watch a movie with zero dialog set on a desolate planet in the far reaches of space where we can see both species' behavior in action.Then again, people would **** about that, too.",

Now, don't get me wrong, it wasn't 100% spot on and of course, there were flaws with the character selection and storyline, but all in all, the movie delivers everything that one expects from an alien movie - gore, shocks, amazing special effects and plenty of thrills and spills.The movie sort of takes the next step from Alien Resurrection's ending and brings the aliens to earth and explores the massacre that happens when aliens are let loose amongst the general population, and there are plenty of shocks and scares when some unsuspecting homeless person, father and son hunting team or high school jock runs into a facehugger or alien sentry.The characters aren't particularly interesting - there's no Ripley here - but at the end of the day, you want the humans to live and for the aliens not to spread past the town's borders and infest the rest of the world - there were plenty of shocks and gasps when the main characters are killed one by one in a manner of gruesome encounters.The best thing about the movie for me had to be all the nods to the original movies - the opening titles have the sound effect from aliens when Hudson is tracking the aliens and they're coming closer and closer, when the humans get into the army truck and drive off the score is similar to when Ripley commanders the naval soldiers' truck and drives the rescue mission into the aliens nest, when the civil guard attacks the aliens, you have the same screaming, mass chaos and alien screams that you hear when the soldiers get attacked in aliens, and of course, the ending with the mystery lady......All in all, this was the kind of AVP and alien movie that I was looking forward to and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope the ongoing interest in the franchise encourages Cameron or Scott or Weaver to get back to the drawing board and bring us a new Alien movie to continue the alien story - with Ripley!Go see it, shocks and gore galore!",

It isn't as horribly dumb and stupid as some people make it out to be. From what I've read, you either love the movie or you hate it: that's your business. If you don't love aliens and predators, then don't waste $8. Sure, I agree, there were plot holes and the characters weren't developed enough, and perhaps if the movie was longer, their budget was greater or they had some better actors the movie would have been a bigger hit. (Even though the action and the CGI's were awesome!) But they didn't and it wasn't. The great thing about it was that they had some kick-ass action. The soundtracks and some of the scenes were taken from the original alien/predator movies, but overall it is a GOOD movie.SPOILER AHEAD... And yeah, they killed a little boy and some pregnant women, maybe even some newborns...but I mean, come on big deal! Don't completely disown the Strause brothers for going to an area where no one else had enough guts to go. Sure, they killed a kid. It's not like children are completely safe from harm when it comes to killer aliens from outer space. They saved enough children in the first alien and predator movies. It's about time. I'm just saying, it gives it more of a realistic feel. They did save that one kid...I, personally, loved the movie, as for the rest of you, go see it and develop your own opinion, because I can't do that for you. I just simply tried to give the movie some more dignity. It was GOOD, not terrible, unwatchable and so horrendously set up that all you get out of it is a good nap. It is a good idea and I'm sure that there are plenty of people that could have made it better. And I'm sure that a lot of things could have been made better. But it's done and we should just live with what's there. Maybe one day an even better director will revive it and make AvP3, who knows? And maybe people will love it.And by the way, some of the \"major plot holes\" that many of you found could be explained and made logical. All I wish is that the characters were developed more. Other than that, good movie--and that predator kicked ass, even though there was only one.If you hate it, then don't watch it. If you love it, like me, good for you--buy it when it comes out on DVD. But people, remember, it's just a movie, it's not like it's real or something. It is just some good, old-fashioned entertainment.",

When I first saw the Alien skull in the trophy case in \"Predator 2,\" I often held out hope that one day the budgeting, the special-effects wizardry, and a gigantic performance actor (R.I.P. Kevin Peter Hall) would be available to bring my favorite comic book franchise of all time to the silver screen. I got my wish in 2004.The first AvP was a bit of a let-down (PG-13????!!!!!) in some respects, but a valiant effort in others. Paul Anderson did what he could to incorporate many aspects of the AvP mythos into the plot line (the first comic series, the video game, etc.), but it still kind of fizzled out in a lot of ways. The plot holes and crappy acting aside, I was beside myself seeing these iconic monsters battling it out before my eyes. And the emergence of the Predalien at the end literally left me salivating for a sequel.Fast forward 3 years and now we have \"AvP:R.\" I'm not going to lie; when I first saw the trailer on YouTube last August, the thought of waiting four months to see this movie was almost too much to bear. That's how good it looked, even compared to the first AvP. This film picks up directly where the first left off, which spares us the agony of \"plot development\" and instead dives straight into the balls-out extra-terrestrial ultra-violence that we all paid to see. And for those who complain about the \"lack of plot,\" when you view the two parts as a whole, the first movie ended as the plot was still building. Maybe that helps, maybe it doesn't.All in all, most of the criticisms levied against this film are dead-on; two-dimensional characters, phoned-in performances, violence for violence's sake. Big deal. If you're the kind of person who experienced some sort of existential crisis when \"Dumb and Dumber\" didn't provide the answers to all of life's burning questions, then watching this movie is going to be extremely painful for you. The rest of us just want to have fun. Besides, look at the source material: While the premise was great, the comic book series aren't especially well-written (not counting, of course, the very first series from 1991 and Chris Claremont's \"Deadliest of the Species\" series from 1993-1994). Bottom line: This ain't Sundance and it sure as hell ain't Shakespeare in the Park, okay? The deficiency of the human actors notwithstanding, I really enjoyed some of the stuff they did with the Predator character this time around: A glimpse into their homeworld, dual shoulder-cannons, and an overall badassitude delivered in spades as the Aliens are dispatched in the nastiest manner possible. Very, very entertaining to watch and it had the little Predator-nerd in me jumping with glee.My only REAL problem with the film was the ending. The climactic showdown between the Predator and the Predalien was a bit anti-climactic. And the fight doesn't really matter anyway because they both get caught in a fireball after the Army orders a nuclear strike to \"contain the area\" (since when does the Army have the authority to dispatch F-22's?.....Oh, and in case you were wondering, the Colorado National Guard is not based in Colorado Springs. I live in Colorado Springs. I know.). At any rate, the nuke was a chicken$#it way to end the movie. I would have liked to have seen the Predator kill the Predalien and then find a way to stow onto the helicopter (GET TO THE CHOPPA!!) so as to escape the blast. But NOOOOOOOO. That wouldn't be fair to the Alien fans!! Pfft.All in all, this isn't the worst sci-fi movie ever made. I think that title could definitely be reserved for \"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\" or even \"Supernova.\" This movie is fun, it's flashy, and it's gory. Don't read too much into it because you'll only be disappointed.A couple of side notes: Being a Colorado native, I would venture to guess that the decision to make Gunnison the backdrop for this film is quite appropriate being that the town is a major hub for hundreds of elk \"hunters\" from all over the state and the country.Also, if you've ever been to Gunnison, you know that there are worse ways to end a movie than having that town get blown up by a nuclear bomb. :)",

The film was predictable (but what movie isn't these days?). The plot line wasn't as well put together as I hoped, but it didn't rely on a plot twist every twenty minutes to keep the audience awake. And the fact that there was only one predator killing over 50 aliens seemed doubtful. However I knew that this is what the movie was going to be like, in fact I was doubtful if it even was half as good as the flop that was the original. I was shocked that I liked it much more than the first one. Many scenes in the film do seem to take off of some of the alien movies. But so far I've been saying only negative things about it, so here are the positives. If your looking for a movie that you can actually watch the whole way through, this would be it. It is non-stop action, and the plot line doesn't go so far off that you sit there wondering what is going on. The movie moves at a nice pace, not slow (like the bore that was No country for old men) and not to fast (like the mind numbing oceans 13). The aliens look way more menacing than the ones from the first one (they looked funny in the first), and the predator was much more of a hunter than any of the other films made the species look like. There are also many scenes which use the full capability of both the species, using many of the what ifs. And the thing that I liked most about this movie is that it was more real than any of the first avp movie, which went to far out on a tangent. So I have a theory about this movie, if you enter the theater expecting another Citizen Kane or Godfather, I can safely say YES you will be disappointed. But if your there to watch an exciting film that will leave you at the edge of your seat such as Resident Evil 3 or Hit-man, then NO you won't be disappointed. So in the end, It wasn't as good as Alien 1 or 2, it was WAY better than Alien 3&4, it had a more interesting plot than either predator movie, and it wasn't a disgrace like AVP1.",

Every bad comment discussed character development, plot lines, plot holes, etc etc. Every great comment discussed kick assery, sweet gadgets, and lots and lots of mindless violence and destruction. That's how I knew I would love this movie. Now before the nut jobs reading this judge me, I'm not a fan of real life violence. I understand the difference between fantasy and reality. Which is why I can love this movie so damn much. Here it goes...Look at the title people. I think the first three words might be Alien vs. Predator. I don't see anything in that title that would lead me to believe \"Oscar worthy\" or \"in-depth\". So I wonder, when you hear that what does your brain think? If your brain thinks character development, then you have serious problems with the way your brain processes information. If you hear sweet alien death scenes then your brain is working top notch. Just think about it, when you hear WWF Cage Match are you really hoping to see 40 minutes of The Undertaker discussing why he's in the cage match and how if he doesn't win, he won't have the money for his daughter's surgery. Hell no, all you hear is kicking ass. (On a side note I don't watch wrestling, it's just a good metaphor)This movie was everything I wanted it to be. I didn't want to see a movie that sucked me into the characters and made me care about them. I didn't want a movie that spent more than five minutes progressing a plot. I wanted exactly what that title states. I wanted something based solely on straight up sci-fi killing madness. The damn movie is called Alien vs. Predator. That's all I wanted to see and that's exactly what I got. Aliens fighting a predator, a predator fighting aliens. It's in the damn title people.If you went to see this movie and didn't enjoy it... tough luck. Think for a change. So to actually give some advice for the movie going public that is still reading this far, (congrats, you have patience above and beyond the majority of people, which is kinda sad, but $#%& them, they couldn't read this far anyways) if you want an in depth movie that will make you think and care and feel emotions, DO NOT see this movie. You will hate it. Go see Juno or Charlie Wilson's War instead. However, if you want exactly what the title states, you will get it, and you will love every single moment of it. This movie is as bad ass as it is kick ass. Trust me on this one, if watching Alien's fight a Predator ends up in your fantasies as often as hot chick's do (which I honestly hope it doesn't, though I can understand how that could be) you will love everything you see.",

I had already given up on seeing a alien (/predator) movie that would really entertain me.The movie was not without flaws, and im not talking about a weak plot (dude, its aliens vs predator not shindlers list).OK, the teenage drama stuff was kind of unnecessary but it didn't bother me that much.What really annoyed me was the way to close up shots during the action scenes, combined with the fast movement and the plentiful darkness i had a hard time recognizing what was going on at some points.*beep* that bourne legacy camera and cutting style (it totally ruins the action!) I want to see what is happening and don't want to guess who just got what, where.I understand the film makers wanted to avoid showing the creatures too clearly to make them more frightening, that's all right. But It was just too dark at times.All in all a good movie, compared to what we have been fed in the past since aliens (alien3 was OK but NO GUNS WTF?!?)I would happily buy a ticket for avp3 if they decide to continue the story where avp2 ended. As i said, its a action/scifi/monster flick and it does its job good. So please don't look for shindlers list, you wont find it here.I do hope they are going to lend a bit more from the avp comics, that would be so awesome. This part was a nice start.",

There will always be people who don't want the Alien or Predator series to be tarnished by numerous brainless sequels, I for one am one of those people. However I do feel that this film delivers some serious kick ass action and a decent story whilst tying up some ends.The predalien is a new twist to the series which to me is needed whilst the alien and predator are back doing what they do best, the fact that most action with both creatures is shot for real without CGI for the most part brings back some reality into the film series. I find it doesn't matter how 'real' something looks, your mind just tells you that it isn't real. The acting was something that I felt may let the story down as there are no real recognisable big names but they were believable in the roles they played.Being set in modern day Colorado I was fearing from the trailers a bit of a teen slasher flick vibe but it didn't turn into one. I thought too that being set where it's set it would just feel too far removed from its space roots to feel like an alien film (thank god for sewers). Although it is interesting to note, I mean who says Alien films have to be in space? The music was well written as there was recognisable themes running through the score for the predator and alien. The other thing in this film is that it didn't play safe and everyone was fair game quite a few chestbursting scenes that are far gorier than AvP.Now, spoiler or 2 ahead so be warned... The story picks up straight after AvP with the predalien chestburster wreaking havoc onboard the predator ship. I swear the aliens seem to grow faster in each flick however it was hinted that the predators used a juiced up queen in the pyramid in the original. This was so that laying of eggs, facehugger gestation and alien growth time are hastened so the hunt can begin sooner. The predator in the film seems to be the guy who ties up loose ends but ultimately he ends up over his head as the alien spawn gets larger and larger. There are some very cool new gadgets which I won't reveal but you can see a couple in the trailers. You also get a quick glimpse of the Predator homeworld which is awesome. The main predator's seat looks very much like the seat that the 'space jockey' is sitting in in the original Alien.Apart from the creatures, the main human characters in the film seem to be a woman marine very reminiscent of Ripley and to me thats not such a bad thing as I just didn't relate to the main female lead in the original AvP. There is also a main male lead who is trying to escape with his brother. To be honest I found the acting in the first flick to be annoying apart from Lance Henriksen who is an acting god and his demise in that film was totally unconvincing (Thanks Paul Anderson for giving the man such poor material to work with).The ending does tie up some of the Alien movie mythos nicely. In the future in the Alien films \"the company\" was Weyland Yutani, we met Weyland in AvP and in this you see the Yutani side and a suggestion as to how we accelerated our understanding of technology in the future.All in all I was pleasantly surprised, it wasn't a touch on the original films from either of the alien or pred films but it does fit in nicely to the genre and stands on it own feet bringing something new to the series whilst being faithful to its roots.",

Aliens or Alien 2 is still my favorite movie to this day. I am not the type of person who likes just any movie because I am a fan of a series or character. A v P 2 really caught my interest because it reminded me of the Aliens graphic novel where earth is overrun by Aliens and there are only a handful of humans left. After seeing the film I was happily surprised on how well it was made. The movie pulls no punches and is as violent as ever. The Aliens were great and so was the Predator. This is the beginning of the end for earth and hopefully they continue to go into this direction. I also liked the fact that they used basically new, no name actors. Not to say that these actors are no names...I just cant find a better phrase for it. It had th feel of the old Aliens movie with the screams and automatic gunfire, and the ending...boy....if you are a fan, this will be even better for you.

This movie is exactly what Alien and Predator is all about! These species don't care about the fragile minds of conservative Americans, neither do they care if you are 2 years old or 80 years of age. They don't care if you are pregnant and they don't care if you are pretty, blond and have a nice butt! The point is that we don't matter in this fight and neither does all the laws of the big movie-companies and the ratings that makes sure that little kids should be able to watch a movie which is clearly not meant for them.Many have said that this movie is predictable. They are wrong! This movie obeys the laws of the Aliens and the Predators, not the laws of sequels and money-hungry directors. All the people you think will make it so \"the boy can get the girl\" and the big, tough GI-Joe can save the day, dies! They are worthless in this fight and so are the rest of humanity. Let's face it: This is exactly how it would go down if this were to happen in real life.In a \"man to monster\" fight, we are a pathetic species compared to these creatures and that is all this movie is about. This movie is not about movie-stars or \"we are the world\", neither does the \"home of the brave\" save the world as they always do. We are just little ants in they way of a stronger race and they step on us if we get in their path. Finally! This time they stick to the story, not the boastful egos of those who are watching and wait for Captein America to come and save the day.Humans do not matter here, unlike the terrible and ridiculous ending of AVP, where a human is respected by the Predators for being \"brave\". Let's face it, we are very insignificant in the bigger picture, all though many people don't like do admit it. This movie has very few, if not zero, clichés and all the standard BS that these movies usually contain, is taken away, probably just to make a point about the fact that Hollywood need to start taking the Alien/Predator-audience serious. That does not mean that this movie is worthy of an Oscar or should be placed on the same level of film-making as Lord of The Rings and The Godfather. It just means that this sequel is very good as a Sci-fi/Predator/Alien-movie and that the director take the genre and the fans serious when it comes to what the audience want and expect. Movies like this will never be taken serious on an academic level and many people will probably laugh at my attempt to do so, but the fact is that these movies deserves just as much to be in the \"movie-universe\" as any other films and when I decide to see one (since I like these movies), I expect the director to not waist my time.So, I am not comparing AVPR to LOTR, I am comparing AVPR to every other movie in this genre and there are rules to be followed and a limit to how ridiculous even a Sci-fi movie can get. This movie on the other hand, stays within these limits and they simply put Aliens and a Predator on earth in a populated town, let them do their thing and hell breaks loose! Nothing more or nothing less! This movie is made for those who want to watch Alien vs Predator, not those who want to see an educational and romantic movie with a moral and a happy ending that stays within the taboos of our society. Let's face it, people: Aliens and Predators do not care for many peoples frail needs and dependence of government censorship. These monsters do what they do, no matter what you think of it.So... let me tell you, if the fundamentaly raw and violent world of Alien Vs Predator is what you want, then that is exactly what you will get! If you don't like that, stay at home and do something else. Enjoy!",

And enough wasn't explained in the movie which was a nice touch. However it did feel like a TV episode, but the way TV is going there is nothing wrong with that. The three screaming Japanese girls sitting next to me added to the experience as well.I kept expecting Arnie to turn up though when the bongo drums started playing. I thought that was to do with the jungle theme of the first predator movie not the Predators Ipod selection.I think some people are being too harsh on this movie. I think those people should go and make their own version. Its what these guys did when they didn't like the first one.",

It's all instinct of survival for them, nothing personal. The predator has to clean op the mess we humans only can handle with a sturdy space airlock or something with 40 megaton. Furthermore the main characters in this movie are the aliens and the predator, not the humans (Humans are necessary as they speak English, as well as we need some easy victims). The title indicates that the battle is between aliens and predator - not the humans.I think this movie illustrate greatly how civilians as well the government will react to such a threat and how strangers can unite in a stressed situation. I would say that the movie would be very lame if it has a deeper storyline and in-depth character analysis. This will brake the pace or the stress factor of the movie and furthermore add irrelevance to the movie as they mostly will die sometime in this flick.Now there are many ways to be entertained. we have the deeper and emotional(which scores very high among film critics, but usually bores the hell out of me - such as all the European movies and woody Allen flicks)and Then, we have this(not a deep story just visual pleasure)such as porn-flicks, Tarantino movies, gore movies, martial arts movies, all die hards and the most used action story \"I used to work for some government agency, but now i'm framed\". If you like any of these movies then you know what i talk about, and then this movies is you! - remember the Beers, Smokes and Pizzas and watch it with your best friends:) it's time for rock'n'roll!one more thing boys - its sci-fi! don't be too serious :)",

The predator is a real badass here, being a ruthless scavenger taking no prisoners while the aliens look very old school with the closeup shots and noises. The old predator music that was in the first 5 minute trailer was not included here which sucked cause I thought it was a nice touch. The Barack Obama cop gets owned for being naive and Dallas and that Sigourney Weaver chick come off pretty good at the end since they knew better of the army's agenda.Overall, if I skip the non-predator non-alien scenes in the beginning, the buildup to the chaos at the end keeps me stoked, so it's nice to watch once and a while for my Predator fix, but nothing beats the original. I could go for a sequel, but just put some Clive Owens or Tom Berringers or Gary Oldmans (give me your own lists if you disagree) to ensure quality.Ms. Yutani...must be Chinese",

IMHO much better than the first AvP film and more like my favourite original Aliens (2) - lots of action, a minimal but adequate character build-up, and great special effects. If you are a fan of the Alien or Predator films, or indeed the great PC multi-player games AvP & AvP2, I would recommend you ignore the poor reviews and go see it with an open mind. In fact I am struggling to think of anything negative to say about Requiem - the music and sound effects were excellent, the acting good, the storyline nicely fitted into the whole series of films. I guess the only departure from the earlier films is that there is not one single strong character who dominates the story like the Ripley or Dutch or Harrigan characters - but I think that is a good thing and a bit more 'believable'.",
