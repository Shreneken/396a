    "critic_reviews": [
        "This belabored summertime sequel is moderately less vulgar, certainly less expensive and, if possible, even less funny than its forerunning bomb, \"Daddy Day Care.\"",
        "A tired and unnecessary sequel.",
        "This terrible sequel to a bad movie was directed by Fred Savage, the now-grown star of \"The Wonder Years,\" though there's no evidence of any behind-the-scenes adult supervision.",
        "Innocuous amusement for 5- to 8-year-olds and other people stuck in the anal stage of development.",
        "Any scrap of charm or honest-to-goodness humor already possessed in limited quantities by the original has been relegated to the outhouse in this sorry follow-up.",
        "This sequel to the 2003 Eddie Murphy comedy may appeal to auds still young enough not to have seen it all before, or who still find flatulence hilarious, or who think adults, when agitated, flail about like epileptic marionettes.",
        "A recruiting poster for kids, insisting that there\u2019s no domestic problem that military values can\u2019t solve.",
        "It's gotten to the point where Gooding's presence on a marquee practically guarantees we'll be bashing our heads against the seat in front of us. Bonk, bonk, bonk.",
        "If you're looking for a modern-day \"Meatballs\" - or, for that matter, \"Meatballs 4\" - you're out of luck.",
        "Too predictable, but kids should like it.",
        "The unfunny jokes center on outhouses, vomit and flatulence. Gooding mugs, screeches, even hops up and down to no avail. Nothing can wring an ounce of comedy out of this sorry spectacle.",
        "Filling in for Eddie Murphy in a septically humored kiddie sequel to \"Daddy Day Care,\" Gooding gives a mug-job performance that consists mainly of reacting (again and again) to nasty smells.",
        "A comedy for no ages, has an amazing amount of CGI - Cuba Gooding Incompetence.",
        "Despite cute kids, tough dads, and problems controlling bed-wetting and farts, Daddy Day Camp should just limp off to the nurse's tent and call it quits.",
        "Depressingly shrill.",
        "Like its methane-filled outhouse that explodes right on cue, this sequel to \"Daddy Day Care\" (2003) smells.",
        "About as much fun as being given a wedgie and hung from the camp flagpole, Daddy Day Camp is an unnecessary sequel.",
        "A generic time-waster powered by a lazy, cynical combination of scatological kiddie humor and maudlin sentiment.",
        "Daddy Day Camp is a perfect family film for the blind and deaf."

The first 30 minutes or so is AWFUL! Horrible attempts at jokes, not even funny, like you feel embarrassed for the characters, and awkward sitting in a theater when no one is laughing at anything in what is supposed to be a comedy. The beginning just felt terrible. About halfway through, the movie actually improved, a story line emerged, you could start relating with the emotions of the characters, and the focus seemed to be less on trying to be funny, and more on addressing the family/social issues, and I actually thought they did that quite well. The beginning was so horrible, I could easily give this a zero, easily the worst 30 minutes of a movie I have ever seen. However, parts of the end were pretty good, so I think it deserves a 2 or 3. Had the whole movie been as decent as the later parts, it would probably be a solidly average movie.",

Simultaneously, it does not help that former \"Wonder Years\" star Fred Savage was sent in to direct this horribly childish comedy, and this remains Savage's only directing credit. I can't believe Cuba Gooding, Jr. would even think about coming to act in this movie that would literally be better as some Cartoon Network show than a movie. Cuba Gooding, Jr. just basically destroyed his own career. Good comedian, bad movies. The rest of the actors are unsurprisingly not well known. This movie also does not do anything good, for or with the children. Lots of slapstick, gags that could get some children hurt, and one kid vomiting for some of the most stupid reasons ever. In one scene, it was nothing but some Capture-The-Flag game that children would play that has no business in some theatrical release movie. Please, save yourself from this movie, and watch some other, better comedy. There are many of them out there. However, this comedy is out of the zero list because of some bonus points for Richard Gant, who played Grandpa Buck, who was a caring, actually loving grandfather. Richard Gant, you're a good comedian, much like Cuba Gooding, Jr., why do you have to be in such crap movies? The aftereffects of this movie: Kill some good actors' careers. Geez. A movie like this could literally be made better by a seven-year-old (like the kids in this film). I cannot believe this movie did not kill off the whole TriStar Pictures division.",
