  "critic_reviews": [
    "We've seen plenty of sword-and-sandal epics, full of robustly virile men fighting like real men against other men. But we've never seen those hyper-macho mechanics presented with the brutal beauty and thrilling finesse of 300, clearly the best film of 2007 so far.",
    "Director Zack Snyder uses his computers to create ferocious and painterly images, with as much attention to each frame as a hand-drawn panel.",
    "A newfangled old-fashioned movie about glory, honor, sacrifice and a martial code that crosses into fascism, homoerotism and homophobia at the same time -- there are plenty of turn-off buttons in this one. But by Zeus, this is a ripping yarn, told with limb-rending gusto, an iconic ancient battle as seen by an iconic comic-book creator, Frank Miller.",
    "300 is a feast for the senses (well, two of them anyway) and an impressive technical achievement. More than that, it's a hell of a lot of fun.",
    "Not since Mario Bava's \"Hercules in the Haunted World\" has Greco-Roman movie-house mythmaking been so thoroughly well-conceived and executed.",
    "300 may not offer masterful storytelling in a conventional sense, but it's hard to beat as a spectacle and that makes it worthwhile viewing for all but the most squeamish of potential audience members.",
    "Look, but don't be touched: There is much to see but little to remember in this telling of a battle we are meant never to forget.",
    "300 is a movie blood-drunk on its own artful excess. Guys of all ages and sexes won't be able to resist it.",
    "300 is a huge step forward in visually sophisticated storytelling.",
    "Cinema has once again proven its ability to incorporate every other mass-media art form. Director Zack Snyder and his computer wizards have made the best example yet of the movie-as-comic-book.",
    "It's impossible not to be moved by its nearly nonstop visual assault.",
    "Significantly, this hyper-stylization of 300 is limited to its visuals. The performances are played straight, and this combination -- straight performances and stylized visuals -- produces an uncanny effect.",
    "It may not be by-the-book history -- a relative term in any event, when discussing the ancients whose worldview embraced men, gods and monsters -- but what a spectacle!",
    "In epic battle scenes where he combines breathtaking and fluid choreography, gorgeous 3-D drawings and hundreds of visual effects, director Zack Snyder puts onscreen the seemingly impossible heroism and gore of which Homer sang in \"The Iliad.\"",
    "The movie swings back and forth from awesome to awful so regularly and rapidly that it's like a jai alai match.",
    "This is a mixed blessing. For a story replete with open-air combat 300 is strangely claustrophobic. And for a film with lotsa flesh and even more blood, it's light on flesh-and-blood characters.",
    "300 is at its best when it settles for purely visceral thrills, such as Leonidas' battle against a hulking warrior twice the size of a normal man. The movie's broad strokes are all superlative: It's the details that keep 300 from being anything more than a striking curiosity.",
    "The action epic 300 is so overblown, overheated and over the top that on some level, it's fun to get caught up in the operatic dizziness of it.",
    "A blustery, bombastic, visually arresting account of the Battle of Thermopylae as channeled through the rabid imagination of graphic novelist Frank Miller.",
    "Visually stunning, thoroughly belligerent and as shallow as a pygmy’s paddling pool, this is a whole heap of style tinged with just a smidgen of substance.",
    "300 is \"Gladiator\" for the gamer set.",
    "Just about everything in this pea-brained epic is overscaled and overwrought – it's a cartoon trying to be a towering triptych.",
    "300 is something to see, but unless you love violence as much as a Spartan, Quentin Tarantino or a video-game-playing teenage boy, you will not be endlessly fascinated.",
    "That it's so flat as an action movie probably has a lot to do with why people might prefer to jawbone over its putatively controversial aspects--there's really not much of a “wow” factor to revel in.",
    "There's a stale, synthetic airlessness about the movie. Imagine a large cast trapped in a series of spectacular screensavers. It could be ancient Greece. It could be somebody's hard drive.",
    "The disconnect between the human actors and the digital backgrounds is more pronounced here than in a futuristic adventure like \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,\" and because classic Hollywood cinema is so rich with epic images of antiquity, this can't help but seem chintzy.",
    "Sensory gluttony is reason enough to see a movie, and few epics overstuff the eyes like this one.",
    "Part of the fascination of the Thermopylae story is that it really happened, and it helped define real heroism. There's nothing remotely like reality to be had in this film.",
    "My deepest objection to the movie is that it is so blood-soaked. When dialogue arrives to interrupt the carnage, it's like the seventh-inning stretch.",
    "It has to be said that there is a level of cheerfully self-aware ridiculousness, which means that 300 is not entirely without entertainment value.",
    "A fun-sapped maelstrom without meaning, 300 simply pummels you with endless loops of battle-porn. While you couldn’t classify the movie as entertainment, it might have a long, prosperous future as a Clockwork Orange–style Ludovico Technique.",
    "300 will be talked about as a technical achievement, the next blip on the increasingly blurry line between movies and video games.",
    "The bigger question to ask about 300 is why, for a supposedly rousing tale of heroism, it's so curiously unaffecting.",
    "Snyder attaches no larger significance to his arresting visuals. He’s only intent on eliciting “Whoa, dude!” reactions, of which there are fewer and fewer once it becomes clear that there’s nothing sustaining the centerpiece razzle-dazzle sequences except awful dialogue and no-dimensional characters.",
    "As you watch -- no, endure -- this flattened-out spectacle, there's really nothing worth pondering save for a single thought: What a difference a director makes.",
    "It's kind of a ghastly hoot, and while I suppose it does no harm, it also contributes nothing. It's a guilty unpleasantness.",
    "Another movie -- Matt Stone and Trey Parker's \"Team America,\" whose wooden puppets were more compelling actors than most of the cast of 300 -- calculated the cost [of freedom] at $1.05. I would happily pay a nickel less, in quarters or arcade tokens, for a vigorous 10-minute session with the video game that 300 aspires to become.",
    "300 presents a dual clash of civilizations. An action adventure that pits thousands of Persians against 300 brave Spartans at the Battle of Thermopylae, it also pits millions of fans of brainless violence against a gallant band, or so I choose to think of us, who still expect movies to contain detectable traces of humanity.",
    "Pop has always drawn energy from the lower floors of respectability; this movie, in which fan-boy cultism reaches new levels of goofy chaos and sexual confusion, draws energy from the subbasement.",
    "It's a ponderous, plodding, visually dull picture, but the blame shouldn't be put on Snyder's skills per se, and has nothing to do with his ambition to blur the distinction between CGI and photography. Frankly, it's the slavish, frame-by-frame devotion to Miller's source material that's the problem."

The story-telling, and, more specifically, acting and script is laughable in this one. Though the super saturated look is interesting, the repetitive environments and cinematography grows monotonous awefully fast. Call it campy, but the lack of humor, and expectance on the viewer to care about the characters puts this movie in the mediocre area. That said watching this movie is fun, if only for the gratuitous violence and even the corn helps make it a funny video to watch with friends. But, its insistance on taking itself seriously is its downfall, and keeps it from being a \"so bad its good\" movie. See it for brainless entertainment, but don't expect more.",

It looks beautiful, and is modeled after the graphic novel in the way the scenes are played out and how everything looks. A very clever thing they did was have the training of a Spartan boy in the beginning of the movie, which actually was quite close to what actually happened back then. To tell the truth, the storyline was good, but could have used a little more work. I thought Gerard Butler was a great choice for Leonidas, though Lena Headey was a bit flat. 300 is a great movie for those who can stand LOTS of blood and guts, and the occasional bare women's chest with nothing censoring it, with a sex scene and a rape scene. You don't see much, nor are they long scenes. And the slow mo scenes were awesome.",

The Persians was the only empire who called their kings, kings of kings, not gods as referred to in this movie. The Persians were also the first to start freedom of speech, religion, and freedom itself.\r THE MOVIE: The movie is very good. The cinematography was amazing. Every scene, every shot was taken with skill. The sound and visuals add even more to the experience. Very well done. The acting was exceptionally done by Gerard Butler and the Spartans, but some other characters were a bit off. The sex and nude scenes though did seem a bit too forced. Also, Xerxes did look a little gay. Xerxes in the movie is portrayed by a Brazilian actor which doesn't make any sense at all. Beside Xerxes had a beard. Overall the movie is very good and I recommend anybody who still hasn't seen it to go and watch it while it's still in theaters.",

Its about the legendary 300 Spartans who stood against the might Persian army. A lot of people complain that this movie is very inaccurate historically. That is partly true however there were some parts in which the movie was historically accurate. The Spartans really did throw out there kids and they really did give them brutal training they really did grow up in a world of violence. However the the movie was inaccurate in some of the battle scenes. There weren't really trolls the Spartan soldiers did were armor on their torsos and the famous line ''we will fight in the shade'' was not said by after a Spartan sliced off a Persian army however the arrows did block out the sun they got that part right. No doubt about it this movie is hard core except for the end were the king went soft. The battle scenes were very satisfying to watch.The story is enough to keep you interested in what will happen next.however if its the historically inaccurate content that deflects your interest away from the movie than watch a documentary or something. This movie was not intended to be historically accurate.There is some content that they just didn't need to put in there but if you want some graphically realistic movie than you've come to the right place.

Much of the side drama feelings like a side drama, leaving the target audience craving even more of its ultraviolent ancient warfare. It is a bloody and lewd picture, absolutely not for the kids, but for people desensitized enough to accept a movie where most of the warriors aren't treated as people, and by the body count alone, life has very little meaning until it is gone, if then. It is funny that its few bare breasts and short erotic sequences receive more protest than the various dismemberments, but be prepared for both, and be prepared to enjoy them, or don't see 300 at all. This is not a profound movie, often stopping short where it might examine greater morality or elevate the plot. Instead, its best dramatic feature is how it makes you believe things will happen when you walked into the movie theatre knowing they couldn't. If you rate this as a high drama, you miss its point - it is a superb action movie and needs to be judged and enjoyed as such. With all its references to Greek and specifically Spartan patriotism, its bold moral values unshared by mainstream America, and a plot driven by Persian aggression on European soil, this movie is absolutely not an allegory for America's conflicts with the Middle East, and only the dimwitted could see this as supporting an American war with Iran.

This movie was not made to offer a historical account of how things happened and as such one can find a lot of inconsistencies. I read a comment about the Spartans being savages and worthless (LOL!) now how can they be worthless and victorious at the same time (although they were all killed this was a HUGE strategic victory) I do not know. I have to say though that there is a tendency in this movie to portray the Persian army as decadent and weak but I think this serves as a method to contrast the two civilizations and their strengths and weaknesses. For example the Spartans were exceptional in hand-to-hand combat while the Persian army relied on archers and cavalry (including chariots).Furthermore, the Spartan soldiers wore heavy armour and carried large round shields in contrast to their opponents who wore expensive jewellery and bright coloured garments -to impress their adversaries with their wealth- and light armour (their shields were made from some kind of bamboo).Both civilizations were equally magnificent (in my book) and the fact that the 'immortals' are portrayed as deformed people is outrageous. Further to that the Persian army had no ogres and goblins (lol) and I do not think they brought any elephants or rhinoceros to fight the Spartans. The side story with the Spartan queen being 'raped' is 100% BS - if there was ONE place in the world at that time where women had power and were respected (sometimes even more than men) that was Sparta...I cannot imagine any woman being raped in Sparta let alone the QUEEN! Since the movie is based on a COMIC BOOK I believe it was wise to use a CG environment and give it a gleam tone so that it will look like a comic. The fight sequences are very impressive and I think this is a very good action movie overall.",

Adapted from a graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley, it offers up a bombastic spectacle of honor and betrayal, rendered in images that might have been airbrushed onto a customized van sometime in the late 1970s. The basic story is a good deal older. It’s all about the ancient Battle of Thermopylae, which unfolded at a narrow pass on the coast of Greece whose name translates as Hot Gates.\r Hot Gates, indeed! Devotees of the pectoral, deltoid and other fine muscle groups will find much to savor as King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) leads 300 prime Spartan porterhouses into battle against Persian forces commanded by Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), a decadent self-proclaimed deity who wants, as all good movie villains do, to rule the world.\r The Persians, pioneers in the art of facial piercing, have vastly greater numbers — including ninjas, dervishes, elephants, a charging rhino and an angry bald giant — but the Spartans clearly have superior health clubs and electrolysis facilities. They also hew to a warrior ethic of valor and freedom that makes them, despite their gleeful appetite for killing, the good guys in this tale. (It may be worth pointing out that unlike their mostly black and brown foes, the Spartans and their fellow Greeks are white.)\r But not all the Spartans back in Sparta support their king on his mission. A gaggle of sickly, corrupt priests, bought off by the Persians, consult an oracular exotic dancer whose topless gyrations lead to a warning against going to war. And the local council is full of appeasers and traitors, chief among them a sardonic, shifty-eyed smoothy named Theron (Dominic West, known to fans of “The Wire” as the irrepressible McNulty).\r Too cowardly to challenge Leonidas man to man, he fixes his attention on Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), a loyal wife and Spartan patriot who fights the good fight on the home front. Gorgo understands her husband’s noble purpose, the higher cause for which he is willing to sacrifice his life. “Come home with your shield or on it,” she tells him as he heads off into battle after a night of somber marital whoopee. Later she observes that “freedom is not free.”\r Another movie — Matt Stone and Trey Parker’s “Team America,” whose wooden puppets were more compelling actors than most of the cast of “300” — calculated the cost at $1.05. I would happily pay a nickel less, in quarters or arcade tokens, for a vigorous 10-minute session with the video game that “300” aspires to become. Its digitally tricked-up color scheme, while impressive at times, is hard to tolerate for nearly two hours (true masochists can seek out the Imax version), and the hectic battle scenes would be much more exciting in the first person. I want to chop up some Persians too!\r There are a few combat sequences that achieve a grim, brutal grandeur, notably an early engagement in which the Spartans, hunkered behind their shields, push back against a Persian line, forcing enemy soldiers off a cliff into the water. The big idea, spelled out over and over in voice-over and dialogue in case the action is too subtle, is that the free, manly men of Sparta fight harder and more valiantly than the enslaved masses under Xerxes’ command. Allegory hunters will find some gristly morsels of topicality tossed in their direction, but you can find many of the same themes, conveyed with more nuance and irony, in a Pokémon cartoon.\r Zack Snyder’s first film, a remake of George Romero’s “Dawn of the Dead,” showed wit as well as technical dexterity. While some of that filmmaking acumen is evident here, the script for “300,” which he wrote with Kurt Johnstad and Michael B. Gordon, is weighed down by the lumbering portentousness of the original book, whose arresting images are themselves undermined by the kind of pomposity that frequently mistakes itself for genius.\r In time, “300” may find its cultural niche as an object of camp derision, like the sword-and-sandals epics of an earlier, pre-computer-generated-imagery age. At present, though, its muscle-bound, grunting self-seriousness is more tiresome than entertaining. Go tell the Spartans, whoever they are, to stay home and watch wrestling.",

People fighting, hacking, slashing, piercing, and that's all I can remember whenever I think of this movie. It doesn't have a notable plot, just endless nonsense fighting. I don't know about you, but that's just not enough to make me enjoy a movie. The costumes and the graphical area were great, but that's all. I even found it funny that all of the Persians had to be pierced, deformed or ugly freaks in some way while the Spartans were all strong men with sculpted bodies and high morals. That's just disrespectful to Persian people. Spartan women are shown as beautiful, moral and full of rights, while the only Persian women that appear in the movie are nude dancers. Actually, it should be taken into consideration that Persian women had a lot more political/social/economical rights than Spartan women, but despite of that, in the beginning of the movie, they make it sound like the Persian women were mistreated and the Spartan women had many more freedoms. Oh, and of course, let's all remember that the film is REALLY distant from the historical facts. It wasn't just 300 men fighting there, and the Persian army wasn't made of \"millions\", no ancient army could be so big. Sparta was nothing like freedom or democracy, despite of whatever this movie shows. I think it is just another propaganda tool to denigrate Iranians and the eastern people, and show the west as the moral, \"good\", and democratic system, that has to fight the \"evil\", tyrannic and immoral eastern forces.",

The visuals were GREAT but damn, that story wasn't even compelling.  I mean even if it does parallel the lunacy of the Bush administration's propaganda and ill will, it wasn't even as interesting as an Ann Coulter tirade.  \rIt's a mythic story retold from the muddled psyche of a middle class white boy's wet dream: a tad too eager and all too wet.  \rIt wasn't about heroism; it was about cultism.  I kept laughing at all that Marines macho posturing,  the repug mugging and the crap about going to war to save families.   Please.  \rAll that said, though, I admit the beheadings were absolutely FABULOUS!",
