    "summary": "Ian Curtis has aspirations beyond the trappings of small-town life in 1970s England. Wanting to emulate his musical heroes, such as David Bowie and Iggy Pop, he joins a band, and his musical ambition begins to thrive. Soon, though, the everyday fears and emotions that fuel his music slowly begin to eat away at him. Married young, with aIan Curtis has aspirations beyond the trappings of small-town life in 1970s England. Wanting to emulate his musical heroes, such as David Bowie and Iggy Pop, he joins a band, and his musical ambition begins to thrive. Soon, though, the everyday fears and emotions that fuel his music slowly begin to eat away at him. Married young, with a daughter, he is distracted from his family commitments by a new love and the growing expectations of his band, Joy Division. The strain manifests itself in his health. With epilepsy adding to his guilt and depression, desperation takes hold. Surrendering to the weight on his shoulders, Ian's tortured soul consumes him. (The Weinstein Company)\u2026 Expand",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Even though we're aware of the tragic trajectory of the singer's life, for a while it almost seems as if reality got it wrong and Curtis might just squeak past the reaper's scythe with no more than a shave and a haircut.",
        "It's also that he's really, honest-to-God, got one of those movie faces that doesn't even come along once every generation. It's astonishing.",
        "Even if you have no interest in Joy Division, this picture is worth seeing for the unsentimental empathy and passion of the moviemaking.",
        "You don\u2019t have to know anything about Joy Division to grasp the mysterious sorrow at its heart.",
        "One of the most perceptive of rock music biopics.",
        "Control doesn't claim to know the reasons Curtis killed himself. The act of suicide poses the question why, but rarely answers it, leaving the living to wonder, and to grieve. And there's certainly grief to be had in Control, but also joy. Really.",
        "It's Corbijn, shooting with a poet's eye in a harshly stunning black-and-white, who cuts to the soul of Ian's life and music. You don't watch this movie, you live it.",
        "Can a movie about such a fellow and such a fate be lovely? And can it uplift? Control is and, in its artfulness, does.",
        "Control goes past the clich\u00e9s of punk rock-god gloom to offer a snapshot of alienation that's shockingly humane.",
        "Corbijn makes us achingly aware of the singer's talent, the haunting poetry of his songs and how, living in the gloomy culture he did, his passing was virtually inevitable.",
        "Lovely and deeply touching picture.",
        "Those who worship Joy Division may bridle at Corbijn\u2019s film for its reluctance to mythologize their hero. Speaking as someone so irretrievably square that I not only never listened to the band but didn\u2019t even know anyone who liked it, I can\u2019t imagine a tribute more fitting than this.",
        "Control honors its subject\u2019s eternal self-doubt by honing in on that truth and leaving the legend to others.",
        "Control keeps you riveted in ways that \"24 Hour Party People\" doesn't, primarily because of the investment of craft and conviction by all concerned.",
        "The cast is excellent, particularly Riley and Morton and, as Joy Division\u2019s brash manager, Toby Kebbell. He\u2019s a great character, bitter and hostile and a scoundrel: a born manager of talent destined to tear itself apart.",
        "The result is a good movie that falls short of greatness by aping too well the behaviour of its subject \u2013 occasionally brilliant, sometimes mundane.",
        "The result is both a surprisingly lucid portrayal of clinical depression and dramatically a bit stiff.",
        "A rock bio minus the fun. The sex is guilt-stricken, the drugs are used to treat epilepsy, and the rock 'n' roll is about isolation and despair.",
        "A romantic victim to the end, this Ian Curtis is all that worshipful fans could ever hope for.",
        "In essence, Control is a standard order biopic of a tormented artist. What makes the film interesting, if not unique, is the style in which director Anton Corbijn has elected to present it.",
        "Morton's as good an actress as any working today and in Control, she overcomes an age gap to give one of the year's most heartbreaking and honest performances.",
        "Sam Riley is fascinating as Curtis, a hypersensitive young man hobbled by his incurable disease, and Samantha Morton is poignant as his put-upon wife.",
        "Control is director Anton Corbijin's first feature, and he too frequently makes the mistake of falling back on his rock video skills.",
        "The story of Control's creation is the story of great potential, squandered. Joy Division fans should be able to relate.",
        "To my detached eye, this slender biography suggests that Curtis went from a faintly interested glam-rock wannabe of 16 to a mildly talented performer to a quietly glum fellow of 23 whose frustrations drove him to suicide.",
        "There's little illumination.",
        "Despite excellent performances from Samantha Morton, Craig Parkinson, and the radiant Toby Kebbell, along with a noble effort from pretty newcomer Sam Riley as Curtis himself, Control is like a wake where the guests forgot to bring the booze and, for the most part, have nothing very nice or even particularly interesting to say about the deceased."

These two disparate vocalists fronted successful bands that went on to greater popularity after their untimely deaths. In lieu of an AC/DC biopic, Ian Curtis(Sam Riley) is back in black and white, in the ironically titled \"Control\", based on the Deborah Curtis memoir about her joykill husband. Something doesn't add up. It's Ian's idea to get married. It's Ian's idea to have a baby. But in the delivery room, he freaks. He doesn't love his daughter. In the streets, he freaks. He doesn't love his wife. Why would a burgeoning rock star get married at twenty? Ian even tells his mistress, the journalist Annik Honore(Alexandra Maria Lara), how much he wants to leave Macclesfield. As a younger man, listening to \"Jean Genie\"(from \"Alladin Sane\"); we believe him, as Bowie sings about how \"New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice,\" on his phonograph. It's no accident that Deborah(Samantha Morton) comes off as a saint in \"Control\". She's the executive producer. In most music biopics about morally compromised performers(\"Ray\", \"Walk the Line\"), the film tries to portray them in the best possible light. This is where \"Control\" differs. The Joy Division frontman comes off as something of an ass. But the music remains undiminished, therefore Curtis(the Bob Dylan of the post-punk era) remains undiminished, in our eyes.",

I Corbijn would have highlighted the \"fun\" times of the band (if there were any), something that showed them really excited about what they were doing. The movie really puts Joy Division as SUCH as side note to Curtis' story that it actually took away from the realism to me, at least a little bit. The timing of some of the songs at certain key scenes, seemed to come in too soon also. It gave me a feeling of the story being rushed by, where there could have beens more space to allow events to sink in with the audience more. Aside from these minor qualms, the key point about \"Control\" to me, was it's sterility. I left the theatre feeling utterly distraught, without any of the emotion that Curtis spent his short career expressing so beautifully. This, to me, is the movies greatest flaw and strength, depending on how you react to it, or just choose to view it. In reflection, I admire the boldness of the film, and not turning it into just another musician biopic. Probably worth seeing, but whether you are stunned by the films' artistry and power or just drained of all life by the end, is just a matter of chance. I find myself somewhere in between.",

A depressing and dark film, Corbijn's black and white film with killer cinematography breathes life into a film that would otherwise be a pretty typical musician biopic. Okay, it is still a typical musician biopic, but it does look really good. Telling the story of the rise and fall of Curtis, including his infidelity and epilepsy that led to his suicide in 1980, the film is a truly harrowing journey. The serves not just as a showcase for Corbijn, but also his actors led by Sam Riley as Curtis, Toby Kebbell as the band manager Rob Gretton, and Samantha Morton as Curtis' wife Deborah. Together, even when the film slows, the trio makes the film eminently watchable.\r However, the star here remains the cinematography. In particular, there is a shot through a window of Curtis with the reflection of what he can see in the mirror. A truly striking shot, it is a microcosm of this beautiful film. The black and white adds a degree of character to the film that makes it feel appropriate for the era, with this smokiness to every shot. Who better to add late 1970s British rock scene touches to the film than Corbijn, who has become far more well known for his work in the world of music than in film.\r In terms of acting, Control is a real showcase. Sam Riley plays Curtis brilliantly. Through each sequence, you can see the darkness closing in on him as he spirals further and further out of control. Though he tries to escape, there was never any hope for the man as the walls closed in all around. At home, he had broken his relationship with Deborah. On the road, he felt extreme guilt when he slept with Belgian journalist Annik Honore (Alexandra Maria Lara). With the band, his epilepsy wreaked havoc while Joy Division gained more and more notoriety that he could not cope with. Riley brings these elements to life in his portrayal of Curtis and it makes his transformation from a typically energetic teenager to a dark and depressed man in his early 20s all the more harrowing. As the band manager, Kebbell is energetic and truly charismatic. Whenever he is on the screen, his performance makes the character truly magnetic. As Curtis' wife, Samantha Morton plays a heartbroken and tormented Deborah. Her brilliance is subtle throughout the film, but truly realized in the final sequence when she finds Ian dead. Her emotion and power as we hear her find him is a terrific close to the film.\r Yet, Control is not perfect. Far too slow and moody, Control feels emotionally distant from beginning to end. Though Curtis certainly was a distant person, this does not make for a great film. While there is more than enough to like about Control in spite of this distance, it does prevent it from becoming an even better film. As a result of this distance, the film also feels incredibly cold. When things happen, except for at the end, it lacks the emotional punch required to make the film a truly lasting experience. Instead, Control winds up being a good biopic of Curtis with great acting and cinematography, but no lasting power.\r As a whole, Control is a good film that could have been better if it let us into its world a bit more. That said, it remains a terrific look at the harrowing descent experienced by Ian Curtis that culminated in his suicide at the age of 23. However, as musician biopics go, though Control is quite good, it never really rises above the crowd.",

However, the risks of falling into melodramatic or morbid are high. Corbijn avoids both, directing this minor masterpiece with restrain and respect for all those involved.\r I loved the B&W photography. It recreates the atmosphere of those years, which seem long gone, the bleak but bubbling music scene, and the excitement about the new wave just about to explode.  Youth having everything and not realizing how fragile life is.\r Ian Curtis was a particularly fragile creature, both because of his epilepsy and his problem with communication. A confused boy without guidance, who wrote some of the most depressing lyrics ever, he still has a huge following. Maybe because his anguish is universally understood.\r I am not a Joy Division fan, nor was I particularly shocked by Ian Curtis early departure. However, this movie is so well made that made listen again to their music. After more than 25 years their songs sound even more claustrophobic and depressing and I wonder how Curtis would have developed as a singer.\r Had he lived on, I doubt he could have transitioned easily into the light-hearted pop atmosphere of the late 80's. By checking out so early he became unforgettable. Even more so, with this sober but poignant movie celebrating his short time on earth.",

I can't claim to have known much about him prior to seeing the film - I'm keen on music biopics, so when I heard about this film I decided to watch it. Its all in black and white, giving it a slightly underground or grunge-y type feel to it (which goes with the style of music played), I suppose, plus highlighting the bleakness of the north, where its mostly set. I certainly felt sorry for Debbie. I'd say the mundanity of their married life is well portrayed. The music recording sessions featured sounded pretty decent too. The irony of him singing about isolation didn't pass me by either. Its undoubtedly sad to see what apparently happened, although Ian Curtis was far from a perfect guy but it is a sad story never the less. As a film I thought it was quite engrossing and I'd recommend it on that basis.",
