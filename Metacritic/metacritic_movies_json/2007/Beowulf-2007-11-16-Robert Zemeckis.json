  "summary": "In a time of heroes, the mighty warrior Beowulf slays the monster Grendel and incurs the wrath of its monstrous yet seductive mother, in a conflict that transforms a king into a legend. (Paramount Pictures)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Zemeckis springs so many pow 3-D surprises you'll think Beowulf is your own private fun house.",
    "Beowulf is a solemnly gorgeous, at times borderline stolid piece of Tolkien-with-a-joystick mythology.",
    "For the record, it's truly puzzling that this film has been rated PG-13; it's much stronger than that. The monsters of \"Beowulf\" have haunted human imagination for more than a millennium; the ones in this film will easily provoke a few nightmares.",
    "It’s not a reinvention of the wheel, but in 3D this is an astonishing experience that borders on ‘must-see’, and raises the bar for what James Cameron is planning with Avatar. And you’ll be glad to know that the creepy dead eyes thing has been fixed.",
    "It's got power and depth, and two kings whose greatness is diluted by hubris, and a thrilling dragon fight, and the demon Grendel as a tortured outcast, and a naked monster who looks a lot like Angelina Jolie.",
    "Highly entertaining - but far from classic.",
    "Zemeckis has converted the epic poem about the warrior who slays the monster Grendel into a species of computer game. He employs the same motion-capture technology that he first used in \"The Polar Express,\" to slightly better effect.",
    "We are not looking at flesh-and-blood actors but special effects that look uncannily convincing, even though I am reasonably certain that Angelina Jolie does not have spike-heeled feet. That's right: feet, not shoes.",
    "Beowulf couldn't be less faithful to the original epic poem, and that's actually a good thing for moviegoers. It's a lot more fun than the mythic adventure most of us read in school.",
    "Regardless of the medium, this is an effectively brutal story of swords, sorcery, demons, and heroes, with an Oedipal hint or two thrown in for flavor.",
    "Not all of it works - and not all of it works the way the target audience of jacked-up young males might want it to - but the movie is hugely provocative fun, and I'm pretty sure that's on purpose.",
    "Director Robert Zemeckis not only deploys 21st century movie technology at its finest to turn the heroic poem into a vibrant, nerve-tingling piece of pop culture, but his film actually makes sense of Beowulf. In Zemeckis' hands, it's an intriguing look at a hero as a flawed human being.",
    "Beowulf may ultimately be viewed as a failure, but it’s a fascinating one.",
    "The story works, but I wish they'd teach these avatars to act.",
    "Beowulf deserves to be taken semiseriously; its eye candy is mixed with narrative fiber and dramatic protein. But it begs to be taken frivolously. Effects have grown so exciting in the realm of the third dimension that you just sit there all agog behind your polarizing glasses.",
    "The bolder stroke comes from screenwriters Roger Avary (Pulp Fiction) and Neil Gaiman (the graphic novel Sandman), who’ve turned the arthritic legend into sort of an Arthur Miller play in chain mail.",
    "Could call Zemeckis subtle; but his style\r\nWell suits the poem's crude and earthy brawn.\r\nComic-Con geeks and cinephiles alike\r\nWill gape at the resplendent imagery\r\n(But don ye specs, and see it in 3-D).",
    "Although this version of Beowulf (the script, ricocheting between thrilling, heroic, and hilarious, is by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary) does take some liberties with certain heretofore undreamed of aspects of parentage, it's as faithful to the extant version as it needs to be.",
    "People's eyes still look as glassy and dull as a taxidermized possum's. But if you're going to Beowulf to experience the sweeping passions that only real eyes can convey, you're missing the point.",
    "If the arrival of Beowulf is any indication, movie actors will soon all be replaced by lifelike, digitally animated facsimiles. The good news is that some of them might still sound like John Malkovich.",
    "As dazzling a feast for the eyes as the hungriest eyes can take.",
    "Beowulf is many things, but boring isn't one of them.",
    "For all its visual sweep and propulsively violent action, this bloodthirsty rendition of the Old English epic can't overcome the disadvantage of being enacted by digital waxworks rather than flesh-and-blood Danes and demons.",
    "Beowulf is all right as far as it goes, and it goes pretty far for a PG-13 rating: Dismemberment, “300”-style blood globules comin’ atcha, and a digitally futzed and, for all practical purposes, completely naked!!!",
    "Zemeckis, who blazed trails mixing live-action with animation in \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\" blazes not even a footpath here.",
    "The 3-D is necessary to the film only in so far as it keeps your eyes engaged when your mind starts to wander. Stripped of much of the original poem’s language, its cadences, deep history and context, this film version of Beowulf doesn’t offer much beyond 3-D oohs and ahs, sword clanging and a nicely conceived dragon, which probably explains why Mr. Zemeckis and his collaborators have tried to sex it up with Ms. Jolie, among other comic-book flourishes.",
    "I like a good flying, fire-breathing dragon as much as the next fellow. Beowulf's excesses, though, are such that the film ought to carry the subtitle …But This Is Ridiculous.",
    "First and foremost a showcase for the latest developments in motion-capture and 3-D technology.",
    "As for Beowulf itself, it's all about the visuals, which means that as soon as the novelty of 3-D wears off, the experience has been had.",
    "Ten years from now, Beowulf may look like the groundbreaking project that helped kill live-action movies, but for the moment, its uncomfortable jokes and fakey rendering of life leave it wedged firmly in the uncanny valley. (Insert your own joke about Jolie's astonishing animated anatomy here.)",
    "Owing more to the sword-and-sex-play fantasies of 12-year-olds than the traditions of Old English poetry, Robert Zemeckis' Beowulf will allow adolescents to have their cheesecake - and beefcake - and eat it, too.",
    "Certainly, modern interpretations should add their own spin to an ancient tale, but in the hands of director Robert Zemeckis, Beowulf becomes... silly.",
    "Beowulf appears so cartoony, in fact, that the academy just put it on the short list of films to be considered for the Oscar in feature animation.",
    "Ambitious, overbearing and hollow; it goes overboard to impress, yet it never feels truly inventive or imaginative. At best, it achieves a level of clumsy camp.",
    "The most interesting thing about Beowulf, alas, is its technology. It's the work of a man who has fallen in love with his toys, but I miss the wicked satirist who made \"Used Cars.\" And the truth is the motion capture in Beowulf comes across as an unsatisfying compromise between animation and live action."

I thought it brought a difficult text to life, giving it a new interpretation suited for cinematic length and modern audiences, and would be brilliant for A level literature students.  When this poem was first written down it had already been narrated by travelling storytellers for centuries, changing and improvising it into many versions, so those who complain it isn't a strict interpretation should see it in its historical context.  I thought the animation was brilliant; dark , chilling, horrific, gory and allowing fight sequences worthy of its heroes.  The cast, even behind their animated avatars, were brave and noble.  And I thought the story of Grendel's mother was a great plot idea giving an extra, modern twist to the tragedy.  All in all, one of the best movies I have seen for ages.",

On the surface, it's just another hero movie, with a rambunctious and invincible Beowulf. It goes much deeper than that though, with a persistent feeling of an Age that is coming to an end.Beowulf is a liar, exaggerating his own adventures, and learns all too soon that your dreams tend to decay around you once you make them come true. He fails his most important trial and will eventually have to pay a hefty price for that.Rothgar is an aging, disgusting pig living on past glories, surrounded by adulators who only crave his gold. His famed mead hall is just a glorified shack.When Beowulf comes as the hero who will defeat the monster, there is no oceanic crowd cheering him but just a few, unconvinced peasants. And in the background the Christian religion is undermining what remains of the days of the glorious heroes, fighting in the name of the Norse Gods.It's a crepuscular tale of regret and longing, for an ideal that cannot really exist. In many ways, it can be regarded of a coming of age tale, of romanticism that eventually needs to confront reality.",

Since apparently the one in place absolutely cannot be trusted. I quote from the MPAA PG-13 guidelines, \"More than brief nudity will require at least a PG-13 rating, but such nudity in a PG-13 rated motion picture generally will not be sexually oriented.\" Wow, I guess I was imaging things because I could have sworn while watching Beowulf that not only is the nudity in this picture prolonged, but it extremely sexuality oriented, having unrelenting sexual references throughout the moving as well. Oh, and don't forget the obvious sexual moaning during a scene with nearly fully exposed heaving breasts either. The sexual wording is such that it carefully and conveniently circumvents direct reference to sex using antiquated wording like \"fornication\" and \"having knowledge,\" while sexual acts, some of which are highly incestuous, are explicitly implied. Furthermore, the violence in this movie is over the top. \"There may be depictions of violence in a PG-13 movie, but generally not both realistic and extreme or persistent violence.\" The violence in this movie is highly realistic, extreme, and persistent. Due to the 3-D effects, this movie is quite intense. This movie obviously belongs in a category higher than PG-13- the MPAA system guidelines state so plain as day. Who needs an MPAA system anyway. The movie industry clearly does not care about rating a movie properly, only about appealing to as many demographic areas as possible at the same time in order to make as much money as possible.",

R. R. Tolkien's article \"The Monsters and the Critics\" in order to get to know what the monster deal in this epic poem is about. The film actually blasts away the sense of doom in these Germanic tribes' conscience and pays no attention to the description that the original 8th-century poem makes of Grendel and his mother. The important thing to Mr. Zemeckis seems just to display Miss Jolie and to bring up a circa 1975 depiction of grendel as a victim of society. It is a \"passtime\" film easily entertaining to people who have not read the original poem, who had no idea about its plot or cultural context and who may not express their disgust at Mr. Zemeckis' platitudinal and superficial portrayal of Germanic society. The director, the actors and the scriptwriter should have read the Anglo Saxon poem first (or Seamus Heaney's verse translation) and some articles on it, including Tolkien's \"The Monsters and the Critics\". This film is a \"fast-food passtime\", a lost opportunity that pays little homage to the original Anglo-Saxon work.",

On one scale is the 3-D and animation, which are (and this a word I rarely if ever use to describe anything) perfect- pore to pore, pimple to pimple, these characters and their world comprise what is without a doubt the single most realistic animated film ever. It doesn't hurt that the 3-D is put to very good use, not so much a ploy as it is a plot thread in of itself, as it totally and completely submerges us into the story. But if this sounds like a rave review, don't be mistaken- if anything, Beowulf is more of a failure than a success. Why? Well, for one, these characters, as realistic and stunning to look at as they are, are only that- stunning to look at. They have no depth, soul, and heart, which makes it very difficult to even care about them, let alone what they're doing or what's even happening the movie itself. The actual plot itself is a bit of a letdown, too- I realize that it's based on an old poem, but from what I've heard, they do change it quite a bit, and it's a shame that the story eventually desolves into a simple case of back and forth, back and forth (I won't reveal anything, but suffice to say, should you see it, you'll immediately see what I'm talking about, and just as quickly get heavy eyed). All in all, it is an entertaining, visually astonishing film... but altogether, it's just not a very successful or meaningful one.",

It's fun to imagine that Wiglaf is the anonymous poet who wanted to honor his friend, so he left out the juicy innuendoes and concentrated on Beowulf's good points. As a writer of the times, an epoch in which our literary heroes were archetypal, infallible men of bravery and valor, it's only natural that Wiglaf would neglect to document his friend's affair with Grendel's hot mom. This seemingly stupid Hollywood take on a hallowed text from the English canon is not so stupid if you're aware that it's widely speculated among theologian scholars that the Old and New Testaments were censored texts.

Gaiman's story is really a reimagining of the poem, where Hrothgar and Beowulf have common vulnerabilities and flaws (specifically Angelina Jolie nude) that cost them their chance at happiness. One thing that CGI still can't replicate well is the movement of the mouth. Polar Express, Final Fantasy and Beowulf still lack the sneer, spittle, pursing of the cheeks and the baring of the upper teeth that distinguish live movement from flat lip flapping. The other negative is the poor development of the king's wife's character, which is another dreamed-up concept; for it to be believable, Gaiman should have given her something to do other than be the kept woman and damsel in distress. The final battle with the dragon ranks as one of the most intense CGI experiences, in the same class as Gandalf's descending battle with the underworld demon in LOTR: Two Towers and Harry Potter's duel with the dragon in HP: Goblet of Fire. Don't take your children under 13, seriously. Grendel is as nightmare-inducing as the creature of the original poem.",

Seriously, though, the adaptation is an interesting reimagining of the Beowulf story, treating Beowful himself as an unreliable narrator, while tying in the various elements of his life in to a coherent whole. Not for purists of myth, perhaps, but those who enjoy studying the film for its merits as a modern remake will enjoy it. One side note: I found the Grendel bits almost painful to watch, like experiencing some sort of weird acid trip. The film got better after he was dead, thankfully! Except for John Malkovich, whos typically painful performance as a an egocentric, opinionated and driven narcissist continues to haunt all films he aspires to act in; I wish the guy would stop ruining movies with his stale one-act performance and retire, please!",
