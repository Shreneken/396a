  "summary": "The twisted minds of two of the six writers of \"Scary Movie\" tackle the biggest mega-blockbusters of all time in Epic Movie.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Epic Movie is just timely enough to conclude with a wink and a nod to Borat. I only wish that it had been bold enough to go Borat on HIM.",
    "The humor is coarse and occasionally funny. The archly bombastic score, by Edward Sheamur, is the only thing you might call witty. But happily, Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard show up, as the White Bitch and Aslo the Lion, to add some easy, demented class.",
    "The real problem with Epic Movie is that while it does a decent job imitating films, it never bothers to make fun of or have fun with them, which is what Friedberg and Seltzer did so well with \"Scary Movie.\"",
    "If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, big studio Hollywood hitmakers should consider themselves lauded to the max in Jason Friedberg and Aaron Selzer's Epic Movie, the latest (and epically unfunny) entry in the movie parody franchise.",
    "The cinematic equivalent of a tapeworm, this delivers few laughs beyond the initial chuckles of recognition. Seltzer and Friedberg (who also directed) have another script in development called \"Raunchy Movie\"; apparently one idea they haven't yet considered is \"Watchable Movie.\"",
    "Epic Movie is a waste of time. It's like a bad issue of \"Cracked Magazine\" come to life. It's not so much painful as it is sleep inducing.",
    "The sadists responsible for the painfully unfunny \"Date Movie\" (2006) are back, and this time they've outdone themselves: This theater-clearer is even less amusing than its terrible predecessor, a spoof so devoid of laughs it can longer be categorized as a comedy.",
    "Still, if it gets little else right, at least Epic Movie is accurately titled: It may be only 86 minutes long, but it feels as if it lasts forever.",
    "Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer must be stopped. For the last two years, this filmmaking team has created a series of spoof movies so feeble, shoddy and unfunny that they may be part of a diabolical, \"Manchurian Candidate\"-like plot to stunt the intellectual development of American adolescents.",
    "By the time this dud drops on NetFlix, it'll be as obsolete as a Chia pet jokebook.",
    "A monumentally unfunny time-waster.",
    "It is just too bad that the film isn't called \"Miniscule Movie\" because that is a better description of this epic-less piece of garbage.",
    "The willful sloppiness and retrograde gags make Epic Movie, which was not shown to critics, an inevitable byproduct of our Internet video era. It seems downloaded and projected onto the screen, a failing online-film-school project paid for and put out by a Hollywood movie studio. That said, very little on YouTube is this unentertaining.",
    "Only a complete idiot could think Epic Movie is remotely funny.",
    "I've rarely seen a movie as hostile as this one, both to its audience and to its protagonists, and I don't think I realized before just how mean-spirited comedy can get (and I was raised on the Three Stooges).",
    "It's an ersatz comedy filled with unconvincing celebrity look-alikes and tone-deaf parodies. Only the desperation and cynicism feel authentic."

Only two mildly funny bits- the Cribs ripoff (complete with flatscreens in the toilet bowl) and the bit where Kanye West popped up and said the White Bitch didn't care about black people. After that, nothing. Just a whole bunch of unfunny jokes and cringe worthy musical numbers. Were these guys trying to make a comedy or a musical? It's like they saw Idlewild and thought the idea of a 'hip-hop musical' was good, so all of a sudden everyone in the film starts breakdancing for no reason, scratch decks materialise out of thin air and everyone starts rapping. And this happens every five minutes. It's pathetic and definitely not funny. Some advice for Mr '2 of the 6 writer of Scary Movie'- cut out all the dumbass 'whiteys trying to be black' musical numbers. Instead, focus on writing some decent jokes, link them together with a serviceable story and your next film may be almost watchable.",
