  "title": "Once",
  "rating": 8.2,
  "release_date": "2007-05-16",
  "summary": "A modern day musical set on the streets of Dublin. Featuring Glen Hansard from the Irish band \"The Frames,\" the film tells the story of a street musician and a Czech immigrant during an eventful week as they write, rehearse and record songs that reveal their unique love story.  (Fox Searchlight)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Until Once, I'm not sure that I'd ever seen a small-scale, nonstylized, kitchen-sink drama in which the songs take on the majesty and devotion of a musical dream.",
    "Once feels handmade in the best sense, an impressionistic feast for the senses cobbled together from lovely grace notes and a warm palette of reds and yellows.",
    "In its own subdued, mellow way, Once is just about perfect.",
    "Once proves to be as smart and funny as it is sweet; it swirls with ambiguity and conflict beneath a simple surface. In all of 88 minutes, Mr. Carney's singular fable follows its guy and girl through a week of musical and emotional growth that could suffice for a lifetime.",
    "The music is so rich and completely satisfying and the characters so appealing Once makes us believe that this is all happening right in front of our eyes. We fall for each of these young people at the precise moment they are falling for each other, and what could be better than that?",
    "It's a very small piece, working in a deceptively casual storytelling style. But it's my favorite music film since \"Stop Making Sense,\" and it's more emotionally satisfying than any of the Broadway-to-Hollywood adaptations made in the last 20 years.",
    "The songs don't advance the narrative lyrically so much as follow the two characters' uncertain relationship through the slow realization of their themes; in particular a scene in which they first jam together in the back room of a music store is a gem.",
    "Once is the first rock musical that actually makes sense. People don't burst into song in this movie because the orchestra's swelling out of nowhere. The guy and the girl are working musicians -- or they'd like to be, if they could make a living at it -- and they're played by working musicians.",
    "A miracle of a movie that is both fairy tale and slice of life.",
    "Once is the kind of film I've been pestered about ever since I started reviewing again. People couldn't quite describe it, but they said I had to see it. I had to. Well, I did. They were right.",
    "Music aside, what finally puts Once over and makes it a film you can watch more than once is its slight but thoroughly credible realism.",
    "There's not a false moment within the film's 88-minute running time, nor many that could be done any better.",
    "Its low-key affect and decidedly human scale endow Once with an easy, lovable charm that a flashier production could never have achieved. The formula is simple: two people, a few instruments, 88 minutes and not a single false note.",
    "Ultimately, Once transcends even its own ambitions, becoming a complex meditation on relationships, Irish culture, and music.",
    "Focusing strictly on stripped-down performances of great music and the charming chemistry between the two leads, it's a perfectly realized yet unassuming movie that deserves to find a big audience.",
    "What \"Rent\" should have been, Once is: a Bohemian rhapsody.",
    "Once may not boast stellar production values or elaborate dance numbers, but in its own scruffy way it captures the spirit of the genre better than any recent Hollywood musical.",
    "It's a magical, beguiling wonder.",
    "Once is a film for anyone who has ever been transported by the power and passion of music.",
    "Most movies have music, some movies are musicals, but very few movies combine the two with the grace and pure eloquence of Once.",
    "The film drags a bit and Irglova's inexperience as an actor sometimes leaves her costars in the lurch. But it's a sweet little film just the same.",
    "The film has enormous charm and zero pretense.",
    "Yet the magic of the movie is how utterly wrenching it renders these songs, which thrive alongside the film's simple, eloquent, dusky narrative.",
    "Although there's plenty of music, and plenty of joy, in Once, it's ultimately a quiet, wistful picture.",
    "Even the uninitiated will be hard-pressed to resist the movie's charms, from its likable leading players and its charming Dublin setting to its wistful take on modern love.",
    "The year’s most pleasant cinematic surprise. Once has enough heart, wit, verve and sheer songwriting genius to ensure you’ll see it far more times than its title suggests.",
    "This isn't a perfect motion picture but, in the midst of summer's vapid pursuit of spectacle, a movie that provides real heart and emotion is a rare find.",
    "Once isn't especially complex, but the chemistry between its appealing leads (who contribute to the lovely score) feels deeply true. You'd have to look awfully hard to find such sincerity in a Hollywood romance.",
    "This is a very little film with a very large heart.",
    "This simple story of a Guy and a Girl and their music is very appealing.",
    "I can't imagine anyone seeing Once and not instantly falling in love with it.",
    "A film of limited production values, a low-quality picture and the occasional flubbed camera move. But it makes up for these flaws with sharp observations, compelling characters and a great collection of music.",
    "Winningly unpretentious tale uses a wispy romantic narrative as a vehicle for attractive original tunes."

Ultimately just another story about a boy Possibly the most-hyped movie of 2007, Once is a lot like its characters: seedy and unprepossessing on the surface, but wildly in love with its own self-proclaimed whimsical creativity just beneath. Ultimately just another story about a boy with a guitar and the girl who inspires him (the ballyhooed \"modern musical\" angle doesn't hold up to scrutiny; musicals use music to tell a story, but the plot of Once grinds to a halt every time the characters feel like cranking out another falsetto-y power ballad about lost loves, which is often), the only truly original thing about Once is that it completely excises the obligatory love story from the formula, replacing it with a sort of friendship-of-desperation between two very lonely people who only seem to be together at all because they both happen to be musicians. They chat about random trivia, record some songs, lean on each others' shoulders a bit, and that's the whole substance of their \"captivating, elegant, uplifting, engaging, magical\" relationship (the girl, especially, is clearly holding the guy at arm's length for most of the movie, even though it was she who creepily approached him in the first place). They are NOT in love, though hardly anyone who saw the movie seems to realize this, and it's clear from early on that they probably never will be what with all the complications in their lives. As for the music, one reviewer summed it up with a single word (\"Coldplay\") and there's nothing I can add to that. As one last thought, take a look through the comments and pay attention to how many of the people praising Once don't seem to actually like the movie itself so much as the fact that it's not a major Hollywood film. I give it credit for shrewdness in that regard: there's definitely a demographic who like having their scruffy-indie-underdog-outsider egos stroked and Once plays them like a Stradivarius. Doesn't make it a good movie, though.",

The music is humble. The people are actual size. You actually feel cool watching it. The songs have a intimate quality to them because they were meant to be played in a coffehouse or bar, not in a concert hall. \"Falling Slowly\" kills me, absolutely kills me. If you're still in the recovering process of unrequited love, it'll kill you, too. Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield wrote an amazing memoir about his late music critic wife called \"Love is a Mix Tape\" last year about the role music plays in our personal lives. An appropriate title for \"Once\" would be \"Love is a Demo Tape\". Every time the guy(Glen Hansard) listens to that demo, he'll be reunited with the girl(Marketa Irglova). It's a relationship in the abstract. They made beautiful music together. \"Once\" is the first and last word on romantic disappointment; how you have to take it on the chin and carry on. It was, by far, the best film of 2006. God only knows it's better than \"ATONEMENT\"!!!!!!!!!",

Who in their right mind would choose to see a small film about two people rediscovering themselves and inspiring each other to achieve things that they were incapable of previously. After all summer is a time for Ogres and Pirates, right? With a good mix of humor, wit, a bitter-sweet love story and incredible music, this film is a rare gem that has the power to inpire its audience. The main characters exude passion towards their music as they find a temporary reprieve from their troubled lives. Over a week they build something that will change each of their lives forever. I was not surprised that many of the people in the theater couldn't grasp the extent of what they had just experienced as they left the theater. The transformation/journey that these characters go through is an experience that anyone in life would be lucky to have, once.",

Every review I've read has contained some variation of the phrase \"This is the musical for people who hate musicals\" but more accurately, I'll say this is the musical for people who generally hate musicals because they so desperately want to love musicals. (In case you don't know, that's me.) It's 'gritty' and 'realistic' but also an amazing fairy tale. It's 88 minutes that capture more truth and pain about love and the creative process than any movie I've maybe ever seen, yet it's a fantasy anyone with a soul hopes might happen to them. To say much more would cheapen it. See this movie.",

The truth is that those who don't like \"Once\" aren't reacting against the fact that it's a small independent film. Many small independents can be annoying, I agree. But this one isn't. It's authetic and unpretentious. No, what those few ones and zeroes are reacting against is the unabashed romanticism of the film. And for that reaction you really have to pity them.

This film is a lesson about how little it really takes to tell a wonderful, sincere story that is also romantic. As for the negative criticisms, I tend to ignore them. Every time a movie comes along that gets almost universally positive reviews, there are always those who protest simply because they think it makes them sound smarter. It doesn't. It just makes you sound like you have bad taste. Congrats to all involved with the movie. Lovely story with music I'll remember for a long time.",
