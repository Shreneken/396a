  "summary": "Based on true events, Pride tells the inspiring story of Jim Ellis (Howard), a charismatic schoolteacher in the 1970s who changed lives forever when he founded an African-American swim team in one of Philadelphia's roughest neighborhoods.  (Lionsgate)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Pride doesn't have much surprise, but it's a formula picture of genuine feeling.",
    "Howard, playing an inspirational and resourceful man up against long odds, really is an inspiration.",
    "It's about black athletes, and they swim. It's as reassuringly uplifting as its predecessors, but the African-American and aquatic elements set it pleasantly apart.",
    "Inspired by the true story of Ellis, has Hollywood formula practically stitched to its Speedo. But the characters and the actors who play them are so captivating, we're too entertained and charmed to notice.",
    "Whether this is all a case of life imitating art or vice versa matters little. Few of these movies aspire to art. What counts is the trajectory of uplift.",
    "As exasperating as it is conventionally satisfying.",
    "There are formulaic moments aplenty in Pride, the \"inspired by a true story\" tale of Philadelphia swimming coach Jim Ellis, but in its first scenes, at least, it deserves some credit for doing the unexpected.",
    "A measured, magnificently understated and intense performance by Academy Award nominee Terrence Howard (Hustle & Flow, Crash) as Ellis gives Pride its fire and heart.",
    "Worth seeing, not only because it shows how an ordinary man can do something extraordinary, but because it allows audiences the opportunity to watch an extraordinary actor in a performance that could have been rote, but instead is nuanced and intelligent.",
    "It's called Pride, and, while it's neither as socially urgent as \"Freedom Writers\" nor as danceable and soapy as \"Stomp the Yard,\" it's better acted and tougher to resist",
    "Despite a second half that feels more routine than its first, Pride is a definite crowd-pleaser.",
    "This is familiar terrain jazzed up by unfamiliar voices--principally Terrence Howard and his high-pitched, singsong drawl. You don't quite know what he's thinking; he might even be demented. But he keeps you watching and guessing.",
    "If nothing else, Pride has the best sports-film soundtrack ever--Philly funk and soul, '70s style. And hell, that'll get ya wet.",
    "The movie serves up the expected ratio of setbacks to triumphs and closes with video footage of the real Jim Ellis. But when sinewy young idealists glide through water to the tune of \"I'll Take You There,\" the heart still leaps.",
    "Terrence Howard delivers another solid lead performance and competition swimming is a new arena for such films. Nonetheless, Pride is just plain trite.",
    "Howard seems to be in an altogether different and substantially more idiosyncratic film. When the story calls for him to be Patton, he plays Kurtz.",
    "Canned racial uplift and tear-streaked faces abound, though they're offset somewhat by a nicely funky blaxploitation vibe.",
    "Sadly, the only aspect of this well-intentioned film that doesn't feel completely formulaic is its refreshingly unromantic picture of an inner-city neighborhood in the early '70s: Life in Nicetown is hard and very, very poor.",
    "Pride has little to be proud about.",
    "It follows exactly the same path as both \"Glory Road\" (except that was basketball) and \"Gridiron Gang\" (football).",
    "That Pride ultimately gets to you is more of a surprise than the outcome because it's not very well-constructed.",
    "Yeah, the story is corny and tired. But when you aren't rolling your eyes, you'll probably be wiping them dry.",
    "One wishes the makers of Pride had stuck with non-fiction, because their movie reduces Ellis's story to the level of generic sports-flick hokum.",
    "If only the screenplay had more going for it than hackneyed homilies and living-in-the-ghetto stereotypes. If only first-time director Sunu Gonera had a surer hand, a knack for something bolder, wilder, goofier.",
    "If Pride had concentrated on a gifted coach's teaching and training techniques, it might have been a contender. Instead, all the overheated melodrama evaporates our rooting interest.",
    "Pride's story was etched in stone ages ago by mysterious movie powers beyond our understanding, and all the Staples Singers' songs in the world won't keep it from its appointed rounds."

      "content": "Eighteen years after Dodgers GM Al Campanis told Ted Koppel on \"Nightline\" that blacks lack the buoyancy to be good swimmers, \"Pride\" shows us that the brothers could float(\"We'll all float on, okay,\" goes the Modest Mouse hit) in 1974, Eighteen years after Dodgers GM Al Campanis told Ted Koppel on \"Nightline\" that blacks lack the buoyancy to be good swimmers, \"Pride\" shows us that the brothers could float(\"We'll all float on, okay,\" goes the Modest Mouse hit) in 1974, before '74, and ever since. If \"Pride\" is accurate in its depiction of the era's social mores, you've got to be a little shocked by the unabashed fashionability of bigotry; to openly boo a team on the basis of skin color, at a time when white kids probably called each other \"jive turkey\", and themselves, \"Kid Dyn-o-mite!\", in suburbs all across North America. In 2007, would you get a similar ugly episode at a curling exhibition if Harlem sent a team to Wisconsin? \"Pride\" isn't just a formulaic sports movie, it's really about minority penetration of a niche sport that's predominantly white. Ten years ago, \"Pride\" would be about golf, or tennis. What this movie lacks in originality, it more than makes up in establishing time and place. The period detail seems just about right(the movie doesn't rely too heavily on the era's music). Like Terrence Howard's pimp in \"Hustle and Flow\", Gary Anthony Sturgis(Franklin) finds similar transcendence in another black stereotype, the drug dealer, and more than holds his own against the better-known actor. \"Pride\" isn't \"Hoosiers\" in a pool, but it has more buoyancy than the terrible \"Glory Road\".",
