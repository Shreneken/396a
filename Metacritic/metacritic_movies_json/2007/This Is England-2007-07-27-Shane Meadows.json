  "critic_reviews": [
    "One of the year's best movies...It's one of the simplest and best re-creations of downscale urban England during the gritty post-punk years ever put on screen, and it's both upsetting and very funny.",
    "The script and direction are virtually flawless.",
    "As its title implies, This Is England isn't a hyperstylized head-trip a la \"Trainspotting\" but a straightforward calling to account.",
    "Masterfully charted and acted.",
    "Taut, tense, and self-consciously stylish.",
    "A modest, near-flawless gem, This Is England is the fifth feature by the young British director Shane Meadows, doing his best work since he first hit the festival scene in the mid-1990s with his hilarious, raw-hewn shorts “Small Time.”",
    "It has the feel of a classic coming-of-age story. It's the sleeper of the summer.",
    "The result is a film marked by eruptions of brutal violence, but also passages of extraordinary tenderness.",
    "The writer-director brilliantly juxtaposes the personal and the political, bookending a stirring coming-of-age drama with the provocative opening and an equally affecting end sequence.",
    "This Is England may be best summed up as a \"coming-of-age\" story that puts aside the clichéd baggage often carried by the description and ultimately ends up being moving, genuinely funny, thought-provoking, and highly recommended.",
    "A small film that packs a big wallop.",
    "The movie is taut, tense, relentless. It shows why Shaun feels he needs to belong to a gang, what he gets out of it and how it goes wrong.",
    "Authentic, fresh and utterly relevant.",
    "It's a remarkably sure-handed film, taking us with Shaun on a journey through alienation, anger, trepidation, ebullience and fear.",
    "This Is England, set in the social dystopia of Margaret Thatcher's Great Britain, gives us something far more humane and complex than a culturally specific memoir about Doc Martens shoes, reggae music and mindless aggression.",
    "Somewhere between the pop jouissance of Guy Ritchie and the social realism of Ken Loach, this ballsy drama freeze-frames bleak Thatcherite Yorkshire and exposes its racist underbelly.",
    "Sad, menacing, empathetic story.",
    "Turgoose, in his first film role, is entirely convincing as the strong-willed but naïve Shaun, and Graham is a genuine fright as the feral prototype of the violent skinhead culture on the horizon.",
    "The 34-year-old Meadows has assembled an effective cast, especially newcomer Thomas Turgoose as Shaun and veteran Stephen Graham as Combo.",
    "British director Shane Meadows' strongest film to date is also his most personal: A stylish fictionalization of his own wayward youth, spent among a group of working-class skinheads in Thatcher's England.",
    "In addition to telling an involving story, This Is England is insightful and informative.",
    "With its knockout lead perfs and taut if slightly familiar construction, this '80s-set dramedy about a skinhead gang reps Meadows' most fluently made film so far.",
    "Facile pop psychology is the real tragedy here, a double disappointment given the film's smart take on pop culture."

From the actors with speaking parts, down to the extras that fill out the screen, in unison, capture the milieu of a small population locked together by a generational happenstance. The boys and girls don't look like fashion victims. They look like the young people you see in documentary films about the post-punk era. You instantly know what band or solo artist each girl or boy are into. Shot like a docu-drama, \"This is England\" also tells a story that's as no-nonsense as its visual style; a story well-told about how an indoctrination begets the racist lifestyle a person undertakes, because we're all born innocent, blank slates susceptible to rhetoric, both, the good and bad sort. Shaun(Thomas Turgoose) is a lonely kid. Combo(Stephen Graham), too, we realize, in spite of his advanced age. Shaun's mentor is still very impressionable, just like anybody who feels marginalized. He's a walking and talking contradiction. Graham makes Combo a fascinating character study because he's not completely irredeemable. There's a vestige of that lonely kid somewhere beneath the faux-confident exterior that hatred instilled him with. \"This is England\" steers clear away from the wrongheaded notion that racial violence is mindless. There's always some deep-rooted psychological factor behind every hate crime. Combo got to Shaun. And somebody got to Combo. \"This is England\" is the best British film I've seen of recent vintage that wasn't directed by Mike Leigh(you know who he is), or Lynne Ramsay(\"Ratcatcher\", \"Morvern Callar\").",

Sure, at times the acting is clunky (particularly amongst the child actors - who without exception improve in the TV sequels) but the ambience, the setting are pure nostalgic genius.  The story hits home as a true part of Thatcher's legacy, with Stephen Graham's Combo bringing amazing insight and emotional power to his character, who is caught up in anti-pakistani sentiment of the time.  Thomas Turgoose's acting is also worthy of note - unfortunately he has since failed to live up to his career's beginnings, however here he takes us with him as he struggles to find his place amongst the other characters in the story.  The real shame is that Joe Gilgun doesn't have more screen time.  His character, Woody, provides the perfect foil to Combo, but it isn't a relationship that is explored in any depth until the sequels.\r The relationship between Smell (a 15 year old girl) and Shawn (an 11 year old boy) has drawn some criticism, but that stuff happened, and probably still happens today.  It was presented in a wholly realistic, if awkwardly acted, manner.\r As a political allegory it serves to remind us that once upon a time, not all that long ago, our perceived \"enemies\" were different to those today.  Replacing anger towards \"pakis\" today with Eastern Europeans and Muslims.\r Shane Meadows has stated that the story unfolds as a reflection of his own childhood.  This comes across in the film, which reminds me also of the dark times in my childhood in that period.  I knew people like those depicted in the film, both those that embraced the racist rhetoric of the National Front, and those who saw past it and stayed out of the nonsense.  Besides this, the clothing, the poor decoration in the homes, and the struggles of Shawn's mother against poverty are all spot on for the time.",

It has the most influential, surprising and emotional performances of any film, and could certainly contend with being one of the best British films ever made.\rWe are introduced to Shaun, a 12 year-old schoolboy who is dealing with the loss of his father in the Falklands war, and a boy who also has quite an attitude of not giving in when criticism or verbal abuse comes his way, the part played by Thomas Turgoose, and its safe to say you will be in awe of this young lads performance, his acting puts across this stubborn behaviour of Shaun, something which lands him in trouble, but also which introduces him to a group of youths in a tunnel, who immediately feel sorry for him and take the young lad under their wing. These group of people, led by Woody (Joseph Gilgun), are skinheads, the prominent and often highly publicised subculture of shaved head and punk style appearance.\rShaun immediately fits in with the band of misfits, who are really a sympathetic bunch, but when Combo, a former member, is released from prison, he seeks to return to the old ways of taking an almost white supremacy stance, ridding their country of anyone who isn't British.  The part of Combo is in my personal opinion the highlight of the film, his unpredictable yet heartwarming attitude with Shaun is portrayed in undeniable perfection by Stephen Graham. A scene involving himself and Turgoose as Shaun when they speak about how Combo will be there for him when others aren't is truly moving, and shot beautifully to capture the gritty effort going into the performances.\rBut of course, This is England isn't without its brutality, and the language and violence, while minimal, truly show a glimpse of the life of these youths, and what they felt under the rule of Margaret Thatcher.Shane Meadows has truly created one of the finest films of the decade and shoots i na wonderful manner, but the performances, especially from Graham and Turgoose are exceptional, with the more candid and personal scenes being the standout parts.\rWith the racial segregation and attitude of those that felt rage towards their countries political agenda are brought to light in the film and addressed, but for others there is also a light of acceptance shown for those who the wider world would believe wouldn't be a part of it,  true human behaviour and emotional depth has been outlined in one of the finest films of this generation.",

Rebeldía, experimentación, búsqueda de identificación, llevar al límite las normas y entender, por las buenas o por las malas, este mundo que hay que caminar. This is England es una película que pareciera esculcar en un pasado reciente en Inglaterra, que buscara la génesis de un movimiento neonazi y problemáticas urbanas que han pasado de generación en generación; pero no, es una historia efervescente en lo clásico, entrañable en lo ya visto: un adolescente perdiendo su inocencia. La magia y el drama de las hormonas en desarrollo.\rLeer más en: http://cineplacebos.webnode.es/news/unos-ojos-un-momento-una-nacion/",

In actuality, this couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, the film buzzes with energy and humor, while propelled by brilliant, engaging performances.\r It's 1983 and 12-year-old Shaun Field (Thomas Turgoose) is an isolated lad growing up in a grim coastal town, whose father has died fighting in the Falklands war. After being persistently bullied, he finds role models when those in the local skinhead scene take him in. With his new friends, Shaun discovers a world of parties, his first love, and a sense of belonging. Here he also meets Combo (Stephen Graham), an older, racist skinhead, who was recently released from prison. As Combo's gang harasses the local ethnic minorities, Shaun is a willing passenger. But When Combo ups the ante and his propensity for violence increases, Shaun must make some difficult choices.\r There are two standout performances. The first is from child actor Thomas Turgoose, whose raw energy and pugnacious attitude are perfect for the character of Shaun. There's never a moment's doubt that he fully inhabits the character. Equally strong is Stephen Graham as the demented, charismatic Combo. Graham conveys both critical aspects of his character: the allure and the contempt. Combo is more than a heartless street thug, and that understanding is what makes Graham's portrayal so powerful.\r Meadows sentimentalism has sometimes gotten the better of his work, with tears and needlessly punishing violence, but not here.The film slows down and thickens as Shaun becomes embroiled in a subculture of hate  in moments, it’s a little talky, but never loses its intensity. Shaun may embody hard times and bad breaks, but Mr. Meadows refuses to let him off the hook. His script and direction are virtually flawless. The one exception is the film's ending when it needlessly nails home the point once more, but no worries. The unrelenting heart and toughness of the film makes this one terrific British drama.",

The characters mesh together in a community much the same way that Reservoir Dogs did.  A movie that successfully captures a community is very special, Goodfellas being probably the best example.  The music matched the tone very well.  Popular songs played across slo mo video, partly where the Reservoir Dogs feel came from. The original score was also very beautiful, and far more effective than expected.  Beautiful piano and orchestra will sneak up on you, never expected that from a white supremacist movie.I think if someone were to make a low budget movie, going for cool characters above anything else is the way to go, cool doesn't cost anything really.The photography was also very well done, it felt kind of like a grainy home movie which really helped the tone.  The camera is always close in, which should feel claustrophobic but it works here, feels like you are there hanging out in a crowded party.Stephen Graham (Al Capone in Boardwalk Empire, Babyface Nelson in Public Enemies)  is always a joy to see, he has a quality that is like an annoying little brother you tolerate and hope to see him mature and get control over his emotions before he causes trouble.This is probably the best example of a kid being exploited by his own emotional angst, that he never took the time to understand exactly what he was angry about.",

This film tries to have a realistic structure by using documentary scenes, especially from the Falkand Islands war. The film has a strong anti-racist view in its inner layers and moves based on subcultures in the society and is remarkable in this sense.But the film is actually two parts and the trend changes from the middle of the film and even important characters like Woody disappear from the middle of the film and the film takes a different direction. Therefore, it seems that the script does not have enough focus and the secondary characters do not have an effective role in the film.",
