  "critic_reviews": [
    "The acting is superb, particularly from the three principals.",
    "Filled with tension, deception and bravura acting, Breach is a crackling tale of real-life espionage that doubles as a compelling psychological drama.",
    "A compelling and eerily effective little drama.",
    "In this steadily gripping hothouse of a thriller, it's Cooper -- funny, fierce and bug-wild -- who gives us a look into the abyss.",
    "Without Cooper's performance, Breach would have been a good, workmanlike thriller. His presence lifts it to a whole new level.",
    "In every important way, Breach isn't just a solid thriller; it's also an ambitious and engrossing piece of narrative journalism.",
    "That it's based on a true spying case seems almost incidental. The heart of the picture is the human drama.",
    "Here is one of the best American actors (Chris Cooper) in one of his best parts.",
    "One of the strengths of Breach, a thriller that manages to excite and unnerve despite our knowing the ending, is how well it captures the utter banality of this man and his world.",
    "Cooper also pulls off the near-impossible, making us feel dashes of sympathy for this twisted and unscrupulous man.",
    "In this film, everything comes down to the acting. Chris Cooper, one of our finest screen actors, gets inside the mysterious traitor. Ryan Phillippe has just the right gung-ho determination tempered with a touch of naivete as O'Neill. Meanwhile, Laura Linney nails the role of a career agent.",
    "A wonderfully taut cat-and-mouse thriller.",
    "This is a spy movie bereft of the genre's usual, casual kicks. It's not interested in cheap thrills or playing gotcha with the audience. (Which isn't to say parts of it aren't exhilarating.)",
    "Now Ray has directed his second film, the abysmally titled Breach, and it's a bona fide companion piece, another true-life tale of duplicity gone secretly insane.",
    "Like \"Shattered Glass,\" the other picture Billy Ray directed, Breach probes a guilty mind and reveals how he baffled people. We get a Hitchcock-like pleasure from knowing the protagonist is guilty and watching other shocked characters realize his wickedness.",
    "This is a quiet, meticulously plotted chamber piece, not the booming, lightning-paced orchestral affair we know as the contemporary action film in the Age of Ludlum.",
    "Cooper is the reason to see the film, which was photographed by Tak Fujimoto in the dour tones he brought to a more flagrant realm of evil, and FBI detective work, in \"The Silence of the Lambs.\"",
    "The flaw in the movie is that it can't give a plausible reason WHY this patriotic Catholic family man turned traitor, and the script annoyingly addresses this lack several times by saying, \"The why doesn't matter.\" Actually, it does. We want some reason.",
    "Less ambitious and more narrowly focused than the CIA saga \"The Good Shepherd,\" Breach is a compelling, intelligent drama.",
    "Ray and his writers found plenty of material to fill Cooper's capable hands. They've turned what must have been a tedious investigation into a sharp cat-and-mouse game between Hanssen and Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillippe).",
    "Phillippe has the unenviable task of trying to make O'Neill equally interesting, but an eager beaver with some unresolved family issues is no match for a poisoned soul methodically laying the groundwork for his own inevitable fall. The unfortunate imbalance makes long stretches of the film feel dull, but when Cooper is on screen it's mesmerizing.",
    "The procedural aspects of the story are briskly done, and Chris Cooper's portrayal of the traitor Hanssen is a typically Cooperesque marvel.",
    "Though it's being dumped in the wastelands in February, Breach is better than many of the pack of so-called prestige movies that were released at the end of last year.",
    "The main problem with Breach is that the story is told through O'Neill, who's far less compelling, in part because Phillippe doesn't have the chops to draw out his own set of contradictions. By committing himself to O'Neill's perspective, Ray misses the opportunity to uncover more information about Hanssen's relationship with his wife and church, his aberrant sexuality, and his mysterious connection to the Russians.",
    "Breach is a look at the insecurities and flaws we all carry, it just happens to be embedded in the story of the worst traitor in FBI history.",
    "Cooper's performance is outlandishly great, but Phillippe’s knocks Breach down a peg.",
    "Just as somber as \"The Good Shepherd,\" the most recent domestic spy drama, but more tightly focused, Breach absorbingly zeroes in on how the FBI nailed the most damaging turncoat in American history.",
    "These days it's going to take a pretty exceptional political thriller to top our political reality for sheer suspense and treachery, and though director Ray (Shattered Glass) provides a few choice moments of psychological tension, nothing in his film can hope to outpace the anxiety caused by the appearance of former Attorney General John Ashcroft in its opening scene.",
    "By the end of Breach, we never come to fully understand Hanssen -- who could? -- but Cooper's beguiling performance and his tense cat-and-mouse games with Phillippe help bring an extra layer of entertainment to this otherwise rote thriller.",
    "Breach is competently made but, aside from Cooper's performance, there's nothing here worth getting excited about.",
    "Cold and cerebral, with simmering suspense rather than outright excitement, this is a feel-the-quality-of-the-acting movie. It can’t answer all sorts of questions, but does take a scary mug shot of a subtle monster.",
    "Former FBI agent Robert Hanssen is now serving a life sentence for his long career as a Russian and Soviet spy, but this rote thriller implies he should have done prison time just for being Catholic. As played by Chris Cooper, Hanssen is a humorless asshole who commits treason because the bureau won't give him an office with a window, and the screenplay scores countless easy points off his religiosity, which masks a weakness for sex tapes and sleazy chat rooms.",
    "Hanssen is such an enigma that any attempt to explain him has inherent interest. Breach expends too much energy on a minor functionary, but it is still worth seeing for its fleeting looks into a heart of darkness.",
    "Under better circumstances, Cooper might be said to have stolen the picture outright. But as it is, and compelling as he is, there's just nothing here to steal.",
    "The unexciting look and feel of the movie wouldn’t have bothered me if the filmmakers had penetrated Hanssen’s skull a little."

What you have here is a well-acted study of character and psychology. The main story line shows how, as trust grows, even the best deceiver leaves his ego open to deception. At the same time, the plot reveals just how difficult it must be to remain normal and have a normal life in the world of intelligence, a central theme of the recent movie The Good Shepherd as well. I think the actors are quite convincing and the movie accomplishes its goals. And there is even quite a bit of suspense although it's not of the \"who's going to get shot or blown up next\" variety. My only disappointment is an elevator scene at the end which I think really adds little and seems more to be added as an afterthought. I highly recommend this film.",

Everyone was just cracking their heads, or slowly yawning, and most of the time people kept on looking at their cell phones to see what time it was. I was extremely anxious fro this film to be over with. Since the trailer looked so amazing and definitely a film to go see. I couldn't wait to see it. At first you really enjoy the script and the storyline as it impatiently moves along. And then you read all these wonderful reviews commented how good Chris Cooper did, which he did all right in his easy role. The first time you see it, you must see it in the theatres and that's when you'll say it was a great movie. Then I couldn't wait for it to come out, because its one of those films that at first you think its okay. But then you read all these dazzling reviews with a metascore of 74, then after a couple of weeks, you start agreeing with the critics. That's when you can't wait for it to come out. But when it came out, I gathered all the family members for a movie night to watch Breach. because at that time I thought it was brilliantly breathtaking. After the film starts, your smile turns into a yawn and all those wonderful actors playing in the film just threw their faces in a toilet and flushed it away. It was weak. The best and only part was when Eric didn't know which pocket his thingamabob went in. That was pretty thrilling. But the film just didn't capture me. The movie makes you so anxious for it to end and when it finally does, you'd rate it a high six or a low seven. But after I started reading some reviews again after a week, I thought of it differently. I thought it was a really good movie. The reason why I rated it a 5 is because I thought back of how weak and dull the film was, I just said you know what, I'm gonna give it a 5 and be done with it because when you read the reviews, you think its good, but when you watch it, its really unentertaining. I prayed for something to happen the first time I watched it but what I think was that Billy Ray was loosing time so he just quickly got it over with and arrested the damn boss.

This movie is one of a piece in terms of mood and tone. It has tension, but is able to make religiousity compelling. It is a story about being confused about what makes someone a good Catholic and a patriotic American. And you are going to be left with a mystery because this man is so tightly wound, even though there are sufficient clues. He has a mess of a personality, but no awareness of that. Instead, he projects that mess onto everyone else, with airtight logic that is only comprehensible to himself. That is what paranoia is all about. How do I know? I'm a psychiatrist and work in the DC area. If not paranoid, enough persons I have met who can't talk about their work, but you know where they work, ain't the life of the party. The core of this movie is both about a man (played with brilliant restrained tension by Chris Cooper\") and about a good and idealistic boy who finds himself betraying those closest to him. Neither one believes he has a choice in the matter but to betray his country or betray those closest to him. This is a top ten film.",

Chris Cooper and Ryan Phillippe are both very good, as is Laura Linney. It is also really well told and developed, as the story really unfolds nicely and, as I mentioned already, it is very interesting. There is a real intensity in this one as, while you know what happens, you keep waiting for that shoe to drop and for them to get their guy. The way the story was told also seemed pretty fair. While Robert Hanssen is undeniably a traitor and perverted, there is a good guy in there somewhere and the film includes those moments, which I found to be a plus. The way the story stuck largely to the facts is another big plus as it really was authentic and it felt almost as if we were watching the real thing unveil before our eyes. The only major negative I can think of is the pacing. For the first 40 minutes, the pacing is glacial at best, which challenges your attention greatly. While interesting, it struggles to get going, but once it does, this one is definitely a winner.",

While based on specific amazing facts regardingBreach – A heady Spy DramaThanks to a friend’s recommendation I came late to this one and while constantly watchable, in fact quite engrossing, Breach is to be taken as a Hollywood product. While based on specific amazing facts regarding anti-American spy Robert Hanssen, many situations are fabrications of the screenwriter. That said, this production remains superior movie entertainment. As always, the strength of the central performances will differ with each viewer’s attachment to those cast in respective roles but generally, all acquit themselves well, with Chris Cooper particularly eerie as Hanssen. Director/co-screen adaptor Billy Ray thankfully avoids over-indulging in too much modern sensationalism - apart from the totally fictionalized, sexual perversions of the main character. American-born Cinematographer Tak Fujimoto creates mystic images, while Composer Michael Danna matches his compositions and carries the moods. This successful production should please those with an appreciation for complex dramas with a basis in factual characters.",
