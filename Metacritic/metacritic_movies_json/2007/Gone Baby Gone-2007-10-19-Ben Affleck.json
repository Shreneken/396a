  "summary": "Gone Baby Gone follows the explosive case of just one missing little girl. But inside this investigation lie secrets and a labyrinthine maze of class and corruption, evil and innocence...all leading up to one man's extraordinary choice in a world where right and wrong have become blurred. (Miramax)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Though its procedural goes a little soft in the middle, Gone Baby Gone quietly accumulates in power, leading to one of the more subtly devastating final shots in recent memory.",
    "Gone Baby Gone is powerful stuff - a movie that derives its plot twists from moral conundrums rather than from narrative sleight of hand.",
    "Gone Baby Gone is full of dark secrets, and how they unravel will keep you glued.",
    "There is a compelling ethical question raised skillfully that will haunt viewers. The poignant conclusion probably will incite debate.",
    "The result is a superior police procedural, and something more -- a study in devious human nature.",
    "The joke's on us, it turns out; as a director, Affleck has come through with a sharp, morally ambiguous piece of pulp crackerjack.",
    "Gone Baby Gone would be an accomplishment with anyone at the helm; from a first-timer, it's a revelation.",
    "In the strongest scenes, Ben Affleck gets his lead actors to extract the bitter juice from Lehane's wood-alcohol prose. The movie has its horrifying Gothic twists and turns, but it's never better than when it takes these two into places where the underclass goes to forget or be forgotten or get lost.",
    "It's a fine debut, far more grounded, plausible and engrossing than most Hollywood thrillers.",
    "It's a tribute to this thoughtful, deeply poignant, splendidly executed film that we replay the conclusion in our minds long after the lights come on.",
    "In his strikingly downbeat directorial debut, Affleck has created something of a blue-moon rarity: an American movie of genuine moral complexity.",
    "One of the graces of Gone Baby Gone is its sensitivity to real struggle, to the lived-in spaces and worn-out consciences that can come when despair turns into nihilism.",
    "Ben Affleck directed and cowrote the script; his biggest gamble was casting his irksome little brother as a pistol-whipping tough guy, but the picture is so superbly executed in every other respect that Casey seems more quirky than miscast.",
    "A superior, haunting thriller of abduction, deception and ethical dilemma with a sobering ending - a moral quandary that demands strong debate outside the cinema.",
    "Fans of Lehane's Kenzie-Gennaro books will lament the fact that starting with the fourth book means losing the couple's extensive backstory, but the essence of their fragile, damaged bond comes through even if you don't know what shaped it.",
    "For all of Affleck's skill, he can't entirely put over a credulity-straining ending that probably worked better on the printed page. At the same time, the deeply disturbing windup of \"Gone Baby Gone\" is a real talker. And that's not something you can say about many movies these days.",
    "The film's standout performance belongs to Ed Harris, who plays a Boston detective with decades of experience and an equal amount of built-up resentment toward people who would harm children.",
    "The only real casualty of Lehane's novel is Angie, here reduced to a supporting player who bears no resemblance to the original character, who is every bit as smart and tough and interesting as her boyfriend. It's a regrettable loss in a film that otherwise indicates its first-time director knows what he's doing.",
    "Casey's big brother has made a tough, taut mystery.",
    "A story so good that maybe anybody could have turned out something decent.",
    "Moral ambiguity is the real star of Ben Affleck's helming debut, Gone Baby Gone, an involving Boston-set tale of mixed motives, selflessness and perfidy in the wake of a 4-year-old girl's disappearance.",
    "Casey Affleck has never had a pedestal like the one his brother provides him, and he earns it. His Patrick is pale and raspy, with a slight grogginess that gives him an astounding vulnerability--and makes his bursts of temper shocking.",
    "The movie is taut, fast, achingly authentic and terribly melancholy.",
    "Doesnâ€™t always hit all the right notes...But in the end, Affleck displays a surprisingly sure hand, and Gone Baby Gone largely delivers.",
    "By and large a notable piece of work, a strong directing debut by actor Ben Affleck that highlights attention-getting performances...But, as adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane, this brooding, somber film is also ragged around the edges and not without problematic aspects.",
    "Affleck the director shows excellent instincts, not least of which is letting his younger brother, Casey, hold the center as a young guy not as smaht as he thinks he is.",
    "As a leading man, Casey Affleck has a nebbishy quality and a mumbly speaking voice that I personally find disruptive to a movie's flow.",
    "The story is patently implausible and unnecessarily confusing, and it works to a moral dilemma for its hero -- and a trick ending for the audience -- that resolves the action with so little satisfaction that you wish they hadn't bothered.",
    "The film is reasonably effective all the same, though Affleck has yet to learn how to conduct each scene like a musical score, paying attention to matters of tempo and dynamics.",
    "Very few movies end so much better than they begin. For that reason, and only that reason, this is an exceptional picture.",
    "It's been well-publicized that Affleck, going for as authentic a feel as possible, cast many genuine South Bostoners in both extra and speaking roles, and, while that's salutary, in some scenes his strategy backfires, yielding caricatures that are merely more vivid than the ones turned out by Central Casting Hollywood productions.",
    "Ben Affleck is smart about setting the scene -- he's even better at it than Clint Eastwood was in another Lehane adaptation, \"Mystic River.\" But he's less adept at defining individual personalities, at making us care about the characters who deserve our sympathy -- or, maybe more important, the ones who don't.",
    "Ben Affleck probably respects Lehane the genre writer (there are five books with Patrick Kenzie as the hero) more than he should. He also has some way to go before he becomes a good director of action.",
    "Storytelling problems surface toward the overwrought climax, but the worst problem is the unrelenting grimness. It's hard to like a movie that leaves you with no hope."

Exactly one hour into \"Gone Baby Gone\" a brain-numbing, dog ear-twitching screech sang out across the theater. I looked 'round the seats, and to my left wrist, and realized that film had come to a shocking, sudden halt. But...no...no...here we go...it slowly started up again, like the T departing Ashmont station, and continued on for a complete second hour, before finally docking in a not-believable, yet still debate-inducing, last few scenes. Now, I'm not prepared to say Ben Affleck's direction is straight bad. In fact, the first half is actually pretty good, combining different cut styles, varied pacing, and a knock-out performance from Amy Madigan (PS. engrave her name on an Oscar). But once the plot starts twisting, it's like a snake in Affleck's hands. Even Casey's performance veers off into boredom. Ultimately, the film's only saving grace is the philosophical question it poses: What is \"best\" for a child, and who gets to decide? But even that plays out in a kind of surreality which never makes clear why a woman like Helene would get to keep her child, and how the kidnappers thought they'd get away with it. As for the setting, Affleck does a great job at protraying the true grit of Boston's outskirts (an image I hope its residents soon attempt to improve). Based on his name, he's got a long directorial career ahead of him, and based on the first half of \"Gone Baby Gone,\" he's got potential to work with.",

I enjoyed it because it managed to built suspense and raise curiosity about the resolution. But there are so many things holding Gone Baby Gone back. For one, it was confusing. Simple as that. Two, Casey Affleck. Not only was his character flat and uninteresting, but I also didn't buy a word he said, especially when he tried to be a tough guy with his fighting words and his pistol whipping. Every time he started intimidating guys in bars or giving some morally self-righteous speech about why other people are wrong I just said \"Please.\" He was very much a typical protagonist in a Hollywood film and not at all a real person. Three, the scene when Ed Harris is questioning the mother in her house is just awful. It's full of cliches and pointless yelling (ex: Harris sweeping all the bottles off of the kitchen table in a burst of anger and then firmly slamming his palms on the table and demanding answers). And four, it is really a ridiculous plot when you think about it. Just listen to it (Spoiler Alert): A seventy something year old police chief looses his 12 year old daughter. Then he spends decades surrounded by the impoverished and unfortunate youth of the drug and violence ridden neighborhoods of Boston. So, for no reason, all of a sudden he decides to kidnap one random white girl and take her home after forty years of never doing anything like that even though he's seen kids lives go down the drain ever day. Not only that, it wasn't really his idea. It was suggested to him by some other cop (Harris) who also seems to gain this desire to \"give a kid a chance\" out of nowhere. And the other main cop involved (Affleck) has a seemingly healthy relationship with his girlfriend. But that relationship ends with no discussion or second thoughts when they have a minor ethical disagreement even though they both meant well. Also, for some reason, this also boring and undeveloped character of a girlfriend cries herself to sleep every night when she thinks the little girl is dead, even though she never met this girl and has only been on the case for a few days. The same unrealistic emotion seems to exist with the aforementioned police chief and his wife when they kidnap the \"lost\" girl. After keeping her for a week, they are all of a sudden unable to be separated form her and the cops have to pry the child from the wife's arms while she breaks down in tears. In the end, it entertained me and made me think...but I didn't buy any of it.",

Whatever room they're in, the baby-faced detectives turn heads. Smarter, thinner, and more well-rounded than the rest, better days are ahead for Patrick and Angie if they get lost.

When Patrick decides to follows the letter of the law in \"Gone Baby Gone\", Angie realizes that she and her high-school sweeheart have grown apart. Casey needs to endorse his neighborhood, so he does \"the right thing\". He needs to defend his life, her life, and their life together. But Angie only wants what's best for Amanda. F*** ego!

It's execution and style almost This movie is what you call a can't miss movie it has all the makings of a great film and let me be say that it is a great crime film at that, probably one of the best since Street Kings and Narc. It's execution and style almost borders on Noir and it does so with oh so much style and grace. Ben Affleck proves that he's as good an actor and screenplay writer(Good Will Hunting) as he is a director. Ben Affleck surpasses his previous screenplay which he won the Oscar for( which was just as good here) and creates an intricately woven and malicious Crime Mystery. When I first heard about this movie I had absolutely no interest in crime films I was more into Sci-Fi then crime. But now after almost three years and finally deciding to see this film I'm glad I did. This crime drama is powerful in it's execution and sinister in it's play on words and scenarios. It moves along like a wicked little machine taking you here and there and everywhere in it's story all the while keeping you totally in tune with the plot and the going on's of the film. It's so wrapped up in it's story that when you start watching it your slowly but surely drawn in and to tell you the truth this movie won't let you out until it's over and done with. This movie has a very well rounded cast of actors that all display there talents above there normal status quot, Casey Affleck is one who stood out in this film his strong performance drove this film and made it something more than just your run of the mill crime film, his performance stole the show him and Ed Harris blew away anything they've done in the past and have made a strong stand here and came out on top. Michelle Monaghan was beautiful as always but she got sandwiched by Cast Affleck and Ed Harris' strong performances and is almost a throw away in the film(which her character was anyways.) Morgan Freeman who's small but pivotal role was not a scene stealer but he did exceptionally well for the time he was on screen. All in all this film is something you can't miss, it's a study in the devious corrupt nature of man and the true meaning of justice for children. It's a film that you can see over and over again and it will still have the same affect as the first time you watched it. It's a devious ride of sin, lies , love and making the right choices even if they affect those around you. Gone Baby Gone is a movie that is going down in the crime section as one of the best of all time, and it rightfully deserves it this films delivers non-stop mystery and deceit that is hypnotizing and engrossing, All in all this is a can't miss thought provoking Crime drama that must be seen to be believed. Gone Baby Gone delivers.",

Morgan Freeman plays a cop who is unfortunately reliving something that he himself had to go through, and we are immediately drawn in to his insistence and promise that this girl will be found.\rAmy Ryan puts in the most surprising and best performances, she has us convinced that her daughter was indeed kidnapped and she wants her back, but her actions and life make it questionable whether this young girl should be with her or not.\rEasily one of the best and most intriguing films of 2007, an emotional journey of morality and disbelief will come along with Gone Baby Gone, it will leave many questioning its decisions but ultimately prove a wonderful story in slow-paced style has been told.",

Between the drug dealers, crooked cops and gun fights, this movie gives you all the excitement you could ask for.  This movie is very good, but it is also extremely sad.  This movie shows how some people live and how they would choose drugs and money over their own children.  I would definitely recommend people to go and see this movie.\r The cast is great in this movie.  The connection between Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan is incredible.  The two of them complement each other extremely well.  Patrick Kenzie (Affleck) narrates the movie.  In the opening scene he says: Ã¢",

There's a real ethical, moral, and even borderline philosophical conundrum at the center of this piece that really helps move things along and make some of the more quiet moments that much more potent. A movie that - really all throughout, but most especially in its final moments - asks \"what is the 'right thing to do' in this situation?\" and presents a vast array of reasons for every option, giving the audience a real thinker. Yes, the performances are fantastic, the cinematography is top notch, and the music is memorable, but again, the real winners here are the more intangible aspects of the film. \"Gone Baby Gone\" might not be the easiest watch, but it is a recommended one nonetheless.",

I was excited to watch it based on the reviews and accolades, and I really enjoyed Mystic River (the novel by Dennis Lehane), but I thought Gone Baby Gone was absolutely horrendous and it blows my mind that people actually think the plot was realistic or plausible in any way. Are you people crazy? The captain and 2 cops concoct a plan to kidnap a woman's daughter to give her a better life? In what world can you just kidnap a girl and have her go to school and live the rest of her life and never be caught?\rIf they cared so much about the little girl, enough to go through with this absolutely ridiculous plan, why not just come by the house and babysit once in awhile? Contribute financially? Get her some piano lessons? Wait a few years and see if the mom improves? Let history take it's course? There are plenty of people who grow up in horrible neighborhoods with horrible parents and still manage to do OK in life, are we supposed to kidnap all these kids and have them live with Morgan Freeman? Could they come up with SOMETHING besides kidnapping the girl???\r And what are the chances this girl WANTS to be kidnapped and ends up being so unbelievably happy living a new life with some stranger she's never met? Seriously? Is this a joke????? How did this movie not get torn apart by every single critic in the world? Can someone please tell me I'm not crazy in thinking this is one of the dumbest movies ever made?\r Oh, I also forgot to mention that the acting was completely over the top.  Casey Affleck was incredibly dull as well.  There were some decent moments from Ed Harris, other than that the acting was mediocre at best.",

I am sure DCF wouldn't have a problem seeing how unfit she was, but after all that everyone went through I was so pissed that he made the little girl go back! I know it was wrong of them but what was done was done and why couldn't he just let the little girl be happy! then to show the mother still being a deadbeat and not caring about the little girl pissed me off even more!!! Had the movie just have ended with him deciding to leave her with the new family and checking in on her,  I would have liked the movie but to end it with the mother still being a lousy excuse for a mom and him volunteering to babysit made me pissed at myself for watching and wasting my time on this film!",

It is set in white, working class Boston - a classic location for this kind of story - and focuses on a private detective who sets out to help find a child that has been kidnapped.  Soon we are up to our hips in muck, with the child's mother revealed as a drug runner and user, and the hero (played by Casey Affleck, Ben's brother) attempting to supplement the efforts of the police.  There are some fine performances (e.g. Amy Ryan as the kid's mom, and Ed Harris as always) and gritty Boston atmosphere, but the plot twists and surprises are a little overdone.  There is an interesting section in which it appears that the story has unexpectedly ended in the middle of the movie.  However new things start crawling out into the light, and the hero begins digging further.  It all builds to a pretty incredible conclusion, but this thriller still held my attention all the way.",

The conclusion thought provoking (which is incredibly rare in films).Casey Affleck was brilliant.It would be a 10 but I thought Michelle Monaghan was either cast badly or acted weak which decreased my engagement slightly, and when one thinks about it in more depth the conclusion to the plot seems kind of wierd as well. There are so many children in probably worse situations, that could be adopted legally, so why would any person with any sense, risk everything to abduct that specific girl. There are probably another 10 girls on the block in a similar situation. Still the film, presented moral issues that I found interesting, and that is so rare in filmaking, that this film deserves high praise.",

In addition to the natural difficulties ofThis pleasant mystery film, Ben Affleck's debut as director, revolves around a couple of young private detectives who, hired to investigate an apparent kidnapping by the aunt of the child missing. In addition to the natural difficulties of the case, they will have to prevent the antipathy of the police forces, who are not willing to collaborate, although they have to do so.The film is excellent and really worth it, both for the story and the good performance of the cast. There is no doubt that Affleck deserves congratulations on his work. The story was very well written, it has tension and suspense in the right measure and tries to be realistic and escape a little from the more conventional ways and options. Although the mystery is well covered and the film has several twists and turns, the plot reveals clues about the truth, and if the audience is attentive they will have what they need for their own investigation. The construction of the characters, and their evolution throughout the film, is another element that I feel obliged to highlight: throughout the film, the audience is confronted with repellent characters that gradually undergo an authentic catharsis. And we were torn between feelings of repulse, commiseration, aversion and sympathy for those characters.The cast has several notable names. Casey Affleck takes on one of the main roles and supports the older brother's project by working hard and giving us an excellent interpretation. It was truly impressive to see how the actor was able to embody the character's psychological and mental shifts. Beside him is an excellent Michelle Monaghan. The script gives her a lot of material to work with and allows the actress to carry out a coherent and elegant development of the character, leaving the gender clichÃ©s and being much more than a beautiful hero's girlfriend. Ed Harris also deserves a note of praise. Used to playing tough characters, he showed versatility in giving a soul and a dose of sensitivity to the frowning policeman who had to play. Amy Ryan has, perhaps, one of the most complicated works in the film, since her character is the most controversial here, but she knew how to extricate herself and shine. Morgan Freeman is in a much more discreet role, but he plays it with all his spirit and gives us some great moments.Technically, the film has excellent production values and looks more expensive than it may have been. Affleck put a lot of effort into making his film authentic, and it paid off. Of course, this effort forced him to use a very crude language, but I accepted that quite well. Cinematography is good and the filming work is exquisite, with remarkable limpidity and color. The use of light and shade is also very good. The choice of filming locations (mostly Boston suburban neighborhoods) is consistent with the story and exudes authenticity, as well as all sets and costumes. The soundtrack is not exceptional, but the film makes up for it with good sound and visual effects.",

When you might think that you've got a good idea of whats happened, it turns out that actually the opposite was the case. The story is really quite complicated, with a few characters having quite inventive names, or more nicknames, such as Cheese and Bubba and I did find it quite difficult to keep up with the intricacies of the plot and who was what and who did what and all of that, so it is quite a complicated story. It also didn't help that there were problems with the sound suddenly getting quite low as well, the main character of Patrick did seem to mumble a bit and with the street names used, it is a bit difficult to fully follow it for us Brits I think, or thats how I felt anyway.I can't do a review on this movie without warning that there is an awful lot of heavy/strong language in this movie, as well as a fair bit of violence, with one particular gunshot scene that I thought was particularly graphic, so I certainly wouldn't recommend this movie be watched by children of course but neither by young teenagers either, had there been any stronger drug scenes (there were only perhaps a couple of scenes that basically just suggested heavy drug use but no strong graphic scenes of actual drug taking), I'd be thinking an 18 rating would be more appropriate, given the fact the controversial 'c' word is used more than once, which I don't tend to hear in 15 rated movies, so it is definitely gritty and not at all sugar coated.The movie also I think shines a bit of a light onto what you could call the degradation of some working class families I suppose and in that sense it is quite depressing but again, I don't feel I can say too much about that without giving too much away. Certainly there are those who seriously want Amanda back, there are others who really care about her and Patrick gets more involved with the investigation the more they discover, he puts his life on the line to get to the bottom of whats happened and what he finds is quite, controversial I suppose you could call it. Its the sort of movie that you could, or should even, walk away from wondering, if I were the PI in that case and I found what he found, what would I have done? what is the right thing to do, given all the facts? its a pretty tough decision. Again this isn't to say that Amanda is found alive, or that she's found dead, you'll have to watch it to find out, all possibilities are shown to be the case at one point or another in the movie, which just adds even further to how complicated the story is as it moves on really. I guess it really is a movie where you have to see it to understand and I apologise if I have given too much away but I don't think I have. Like I've mentioned, if you think you know whats gone on, there is a good twist or two in the movie which should take you by surprise and you may well find yourself being shown otherwise.",
