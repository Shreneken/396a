Rescued by the daughter of Pharaoh, he grows up thinking he's an Egyptian prince.  Eventually exiled from Egypt when he is exposed as a Jew, he is touched by God, and told that he will lead his enslaved Chosen People to the Promised Land. With the hand of God firmly on his shoulder, and with faith as his only weapon, Moses performs miracles, casts down plagues, evades a pursuing Egyptian army, parts the Red Sea and, after forty years of leading the Hebrew Chosen Ones to the Promised Land, is embraced by God and led to a better place.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "For those who recall those old Classics Illustrated comics of the 1940s and ’50s--and even for those who don’t--there’s an endearing, earnest quality to The Ten Commandments that transcends its star-studded cast and computer-generated animation.",
    "A well-intentioned misfire featuring 3-D CGI animation that recalls lesser vidgames of the mid-1990s.",
    "Bad animation and casting make Moses movie a zero, not a Ten.",
    "The panoramic backgrounds have a silky beauty, but the characters are cheaply rendered with doll faces, enlarged musculature, tiny joints, and clunky movement. It's like watching Max Headroom lead his people out of Egypt.",
    "There’s something earnest and forthright about the movie, despite its misguided execution.",
    "It fails on every conceivable level."

While this film would do quite well in the bin next to the typical Disney rip offs that come to DVD, in a movie theatre you see that the there were two things missing from this production: A budget worthy of a 3D Animation effort and a director that could direct their voice actors to their characters. As long as the Christian community sees fit to produce home video that does not challenge the mind, eye and senses and continues to put out sub-standard, decade old feeling movies, then their intentions will constantly fall. I firmly believe that God can use anything to His glory, but it says a lot for the Christian film industry and their lack of effort, talent and budget.",
