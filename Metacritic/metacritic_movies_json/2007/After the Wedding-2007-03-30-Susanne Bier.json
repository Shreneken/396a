  "summary": "Sweeping, yet entirely intimate, After the Wedding is a shattering portrait of a family struggling with the fragility of life and the search for connection, healing, and forgiveness. [IFC Films]",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "A highly original and unusually powerful drama that deserves comparison to the great Scandinavian films of the past.",
    "One of the best films to open in the Bay Area in 2007.",
    "Talented filmmaker Susanne Bier (Brothers), armed with an outstanding compositional sense, keeps control over the storms of melodrama that swirl in this rich weepie.",
    "It's a riveting character study/soap opera.",
    "What feels at first like a quiet, straightforward picture builds into one of the richest and most satisfying of the year so far, in any genre or any language.",
    "With a third-act twist that outdoes that initial revelation, the film turns out to be a thoughtful exploration of paternity and responsibility. Much of the film's success lies in Bier's sensitive direction, but credit is also due to the fine cast, particularly Mikkelsen.",
    "Bier primes us for a catfight, but she gives something tastier: a feast of reconciliation and love.",
    "After the Wedding defies the odds: For once, the bigger the emotion, the truer the moviegoing experience.",
    "Mikkelsen, like Jimmy Stewart, projects emotions with a slight twitch of a lip or narrowing of an eye. His long face - often handsome, sometimes plain, always cryptic - yields secrets slowly; you have to watch an entire film to know how his character feels and how you feel about him.",
    "Once again Bier demonstrates just how misleading appearances can be, as she artfully removes the veneers concealing the dark truths locked away by her intriguing characters.",
    "Thanks to a tight script, sharp direction and excellent actors, new film by Danish helmer Susanne Bier manages to be both emotional and engaging.",
    "After the Wedding would never pretend to have any answers, but in hands this skilled the act of exploration itself couldn't be more illuminating, or more dramatic.",
    "A rich, intricate and very gripping movie.",
    "Wedding has enough coincidences, screamfests, drunken rants and shock revelations to fill a season of \"Desperate Housewives,\" but it comes across as finely textured drama, thanks to the performers, who make their characters so persuasive and three-dimensional, we're too mesmerized to care about the story's more overwrought or histrionic passages.",
    "Bier directs with a sense of motion, pleasant without pushing. Mads Mikkelsen, who plays Jacob, is an actor who absolutely belongs on the screen, a gentler sort of Jack Palance.",
    "Unfortunately, in Bierâ€™s world, where even the most innocuous acts can result in emotional ruin, redemption is purgatorial in its own peculiar way.",
    "After the Wedding is full of enough plot twists to supply a whole season of \"Desperate Housewives.\"",
    "The characters may suffer once the bride walks down the aisle, but Bier, Jensen and their first-rate cast work together like a match made in heaven.",
    "This is a fine tale of families and secrets, and its seemingly cold exterior gives way to something unexpectedly warm and soft inside.",
    "In After the Wedding Susanne Bier pushes the envelope further, toward operatic passion and the visual symbolism of Ingmar Bergman.",
    "Those willing to overlook its emotional grandstanding will find much to admire and even more to think about in this Oscar-nominated Danish drama.",
    "After the Wedding ends up feeling far weightier than it first appears, with its plot contrivances and unlikely coincidences generating such a messy range of emotions, they end up feeling a lot like real life.",
    "What happens after the wedding comprises a full three-quarters of Bier's epic, whose near-Biblical twists and turns--I wouldn't think of giving them away--are enough to fill four weepies.",
    "A fine and, on a scene-by-scene basis, often better than fine, if effectively unadventurous work.",
    "Jensen's dramatic structure is so visible this sometimes seems like a late Rod Serling teleplay, but Bier has proved highly adept at merging conventional drama with the immediacy of the Dogma 95 movement.",
    "With its soapy earnestness and use of suffering souls as set dressing, After The Wedding could be the cinematic equivalent of a Coldplay song. And while that isn't necessarily a slam, it isn't a recommendation either.",
    "At two hours, After the Wedding stretches out family flux too thinly and waits too long to reveal the final, devastating secret that we already know.",
    "Evidently, this bloated piece of Oscar-nominated nonsense was a big hit in Denmark, which makes me think there's a glittering future in that otherwise discriminating country for several seasons of \"Days of Our Lives.\""

Personally, morally, and politically, it is brilliantly ambiguous. Can the controlling personality of the fat-cat capitalist be more successful than King Lear in wisely dividing his kingdom? The six-pack-abs guy and his hunk issues are secondary to the scene-stealing business mogul. The characters look like real people, not Hollywood dolls after multiple cosmetic surgeries.

I'm shocked by the high user and critic scores. Every choice was confused. The hyper kinetic camera movement with documentary stylings and no lighting like a Dogme 95 film had no relationship to the Days of Our Lives plot twists and overwrought acting and dialogue. I think this got the overinflated \"international rating,\" where critics elevate mediocre foreign films because, let's be honest, how many great movies are coming out of Denmark these days?",
