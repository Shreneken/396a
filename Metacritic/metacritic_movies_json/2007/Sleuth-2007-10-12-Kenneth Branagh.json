  "title": "Sleuth",
  "rating": 5.8,
  "release_date": "2007-10-12",
  "summary": "A millionaire detective novelist matches wits with the unemployed actor who ran off with his wife in a deadly serious, seriously twisted game with dangerous consequences. (Sony Pictures Classics)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "It's like \"Deathtrap\" crossed with \"Cribs\" as staged by Stanley Kubrick.",
    "Caine, who has never been much for the stage, is a superb screen actor, so good his master classes on acting for the camera are on DVD. Here, dry and clipped, biting and savage, he goes for the kill.",
    "A pretty good movie. It just isn't a very good \"Sleuth,\" exactly.",
    "I think the movie works best if you know the original and have a taste for goofy revisionism.",
    "Despite top-flight acting from Michael Caine and Jude Law, it loses its grip in the third act and let's the air out of what might have been a memorably gripping film.",
    "Sleuth is well acted, and directed by Branagh with chilly, distant ingenuity. It has a certain edge and daring, or more to the point it pretends to.",
    "Language this lethal has all but disappeared from the movies, and it's an unmitigated pleasure to observe Caine and Law attack it with such ferocity. Sleuth is nasty fun.",
    "The 1972 movie was better paced and presented a superior story but this one has its own pleasures. It's an interesting failure - a film that works more successfully as a study of technique and writing than as a motion picture.",
    "While the entire premise of Sleuth is a gimmick, having Michael Caine and Jude Law remake the 1972 adaptation of Anthony Shaffer's Tony Award-winning play heightens the gimmick quotient.",
    "Just when things should be getting exciting and complex, they become repetitive and predictable. Subtext becomes hint becomes statement becomes declaration. For once, Pinter is a little too easy to understand.",
    "Caine and Law may not be playing human beings, but Pinter’s sense of humor is at least more interesting than Shaffer’s. Caine in particular appears to enjoy honing his cold-eyed stare.",
    "At 86 minutes, Sleuth '07 plays like a Cliffs Notes version of the original (which was skillfully adapted by Anthony Shaffer from his own hit play) with far too much of its pacing and delicious texture ruthlessly cut.",
    "The results will be received with a large, loud yawn by all but the most loyal fans of Pinter and hard-working co-stars Michael Caine and Jude Law.",
    "The result is unfortunate: Pinter can't find emotional depths that just aren't there, but dispenses with most of what made the original entertaining in the search for them.",
    "Even lousy adaptations have worth, if they attract attention to little-seen originals.",
    "The new version is a shiny piece of hardware that might as well be called \"Sleuth 2.0,\" and it's exactly what you would expect from Pinter: very clever, extremely cold. Maliciously entertaining, too, until the halfway point, when you suddenly start wondering why anyone should care.",
    "Sleuth\"is that rare film that would have been better longer. You're not through looking at Caine and Law when the final credits roll.",
    "Little more than a sleek, stylish stunt.",
    "A high-pedigree, low-interest affair that serves mostly as an exercise in postmortem speculation: Why is a project with so many prominent names attached to it so sterile and lifeless?",
    "This might have been OK for cable, but as a night out at the movies, it feels like a bit of a cheat.",
    "It's not a disaster: Branagh is an actor's director, and there are biting moments throughout and solid performances from Caine and Law.",
    "Whatever pleasure can be wrung from Sleuth lies in the black comedy of Caine and Law's sinuous symbiosis.",
    "Director Kenneth Branagh has mercifully pared the action down to 88 minutes (the first movie dragged on for 138), but the final act, with its obscure homosexual flirtation, still seems to go on forever.",
    "It takes something really special to bring together a Nobel Prize-winning writer, a director renowned for his Shakespeare adaptations, a two-time Oscar-winning actor who also happens to be a knight of the British realm, and the reigning No. 1 British screen heartthrob and still come up with nonsense.",
    "Minus a couple of brisk, black laughs, this hollow remake botches the twists and sucks the fun right out of its feisty source.",
    "This is a perhaps even more misbegotten remake than the Farrelly Brothers' update of \"The Heartbreak Kid.\"",
    "Art-directed within an inch of its life, Sleuth has the smirky gloss of a project that everyone involved with thinks is terribly good, and terribly clever. These people - Branagh, Pinter, Law and the usually great Caine (even in bad stuff) - are laboring under an epic misconception. Sleuth is just terrible.",
    "No doubt the list of talent involved in this remake sounded great, but the project hasn't been thought through as anything more than an arch exercise in style. And even in that trifling end, it fails utterly.",
    "The result is that what was once insignificant is now insufferable.",
    "If you consider what the exalted quartet of Branagh, Pinter, Caine and Law might have done with the project, and what they did to it, Sleuth has to be the worst prestige movie of the year."

It's not something that demands repeat viewings like a Lynch, Kubrick or Leigh film, but it'll hold your attention just for the fact that you will want to see what happens next... and how it will end. It's fun to watch Caine and Law try to \"one-up\" each other, as the film is pretty much a game or contest. It is almost one of those \"day-in-the-life\" movies (but actually takes place over two separate days). Good acting, great first and second act but, semi-weak third act. Not bad, not great.",

Just, the film itself isn't to go see in the theatres and be really excited to watch a movie at Cineplex. Well, I'd change your movie to Michael Clayton because Sleuth isn't a film worth seeing. So, just for the heads up, rent it when it comes out. Or, watch it on Shaw when it comes out because trust me, it's not worth renting for 3 bucks. Just watch it when it comes and starts playing on Shaw or Cable.",

Both men shoot Harold Pinter's words at each other with cold precision. They duel in rooms illuminated by a blue light. Their mouths are benign guns. Andrew is just pretending, like a blank pretends to be a bullet, when the novelist aims his pistol at Milo. It's a game. The jewel heist, nothing more than smoke and mirrors. Both robbery attempts are deconstructive and anti-climactic. \"Sleuth\" is really about identity. In the endgame, the blue light affixes itself to Milo alone, while the sudden appearance of the red light seeks out Andrew in melancholic repose. Perhaps, these are the two men as they really are, finally, in three-dimensions, the truth comes out as the red and blue lights converge and produce a white light; an x-ray light.",
