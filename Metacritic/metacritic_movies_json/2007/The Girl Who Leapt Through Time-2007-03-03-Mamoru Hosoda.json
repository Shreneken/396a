    "summary": "A high-school girl named Makoto acquires the power to travel back in time, and decides to use it for her own personal benefits. Little does she know that she is affecting the lives of others just as much as she is her own.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "It has few fireworks, but still sticks in the mind, and is a definite upgrade from Digimon: The Movie for director Mamoru Hosoda.",
        "Through a deft combination of physical comedy, teenage angst and small-scale exploration of a fascinating premise, \u201cThe Girl Who Leapt Through Time\u201d remains smartly committed to the emotional lives of its characters and their intermingled fates.",
        "Part of the shoujo genre of gently fantastic romantic dramas about and for young teenage girls, it's also funny and creative enough to charm parents, brothers, cousins, and anyone else looking for an openhearted fable.",
        "A charming piece of Japanese anime that could well serve as the basis for a stateside live-action remake, \u201cThe Girl Who Leapt Through Time\u201d boasts an entertaining storyline to match its well-drawn visuals.",
        "Animated combo of laughs and life lessons charts its heroine's adventures in such an accessible and cheery way, it's easy to imagine her leaping into a Stateside remake.",
        "While the animation is only so-so, Mamoru is a good storyteller with a firm grasp on both the story and characters.",
        "The characters are entirely credible and likable, the simply drawn figures highly effective against the lush background artwork. Time travel has rarely seemed so joyous.",
        "The first hour is an absolute hoot, as the constant replaying of scenes lends a zany comic edge to Makoto\u2019s otherwise banal social life. The animation is vibrantly coloured, the action fluid, the editing masterly and the voicework just on the right side of brash. It\u2019s a shame, then, that the final third rejects the light touch of the preceding section to descend into drab moralising and a furious tying up of loose plot ends.",
        "Makoto's misadventures are specifically geared to the concerns and perspectives of teenagers, while avoiding the luridness of similarly themed films like THE BUTTERLFY EFFECT, and the resolution refreshingly bittersweet.",
        "It\u2019s basically the equivalent of a sensitively wrought read from the Young Adult shelf, and there\u2019s naught wrong with that.",
        "Based on an oft-adapted \u201960s sci-fi novel, this charming, visually fertile film captures the conflicted emotions of first love and embarrassment of being a teen with real sensitivity."
