As long as they can remember, Yasmin, Jade, Sasha and Cloe have been \"BFF\" - Best Friends Forever. Inseparable since they first met, the young girls have always supported each other's individual personalities, talents and fabulous fashion styles.  But now as the foursome enter Carry Nation High, Yasmin, Jade, Sasha and Cloe face a brand new world:  a blackboard jungle, where for the first time they discover life as a teenager means dealing with a system of social cliques, all strictly enforced by student body president Meredith Baxter Dimly.  Finding themselves being pulled further and further apart, the girls band together and rise up as \"the Bratz\" to fight peer pressure, in turn learning how true empowerment means standing up for your friends, being true to oneself and living out one's dreams & aspirations.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "Thanks to the smart casting of Jon Voight as the school’s principal and Lainie Kazan as Yasmin’s beloved Bubbie, the two-hour run time won't be a complete bore for adults.",
    "Finally, a postfeminist multicultural musical extravaganza for 8-year-old girls. Is Bratz not the most totally stylin' movie ever? Grownups won't think so, but for their daughters who share a \"passion for fashion\" with the dolls that are giving Barbie a run for her money, it will be the event of the season.",
    "While often cliche ridden and preposterous, it's too busy and loud to put anyone to sleep.",
    "A movie based on a doll line, is an M&M-colored high school fantasia for aspirational 10- and 12-year-old girls who'll be shocked (or, hopefully, delighted) when they get to ninth grade and find out life isn't so super-Bratz-fabulous.",
    "Bratz's strong anti-clique sermonizing would be slightly more convincing if it weren't tethered to a movie romanticizing the most awesome clique ever.",
    "Bratz’s references and parodies are consistently on-target, if always way too over-the-top. Every line of dialogue could plausibly take an exclamation point.",
    "This is a movie for a grade-schooler's -- a female grade-schooler's -- sensibility. It's earnest, silly and sweet, with just enough food fights and musical numbers to keep everyone else from gagging on the goo.",
    "A silly movie that's essentially a series of clichés strung together into a semblance of a movie.",
    "The best that can be said about the big-screen Bratz is that they are not nearly as appalling as their toy-shelf twins.",
    "In the end, the most offensive part of Bratz isn't its stereotypes or brand expansion; it's the sorry state of Jon Voight's career.",
    "Bratz is way too long.",
    "It's a movie on the wrong side side of the so-bad-it's-good line.",
    "Arriving as inevitably as puberty, Bratz introduces the swollen-headed, fashion-addicted dolls of the title to a live-action movie.",
    "The most horrifying film of 2007, Bratz is based on the popular line of collagen-lipped, doe-eyed slut-ette dolls and their male companions, \"the boys with a passion for fashion ... and the Bratz!\" (In other words, they're bi-curious.)",
    "No, Bratz, an unwitting and witless critique of American consumerism run amok, does not star Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie.",
    "This atrocious comedy doesn't have an idea in its head but still screams at the top of its lungs.",
    "A live-action film based on a line of dolls, it's pure marketing chum for tweeners: a proudly shallow, purposefully bland ode to girly-girl narcissism. I could actually feel my brain stem shrivel up as I watched it.",
    "In the end, Bratz celebrates something even more important than good grades or good friends: the vital acquisition of totally awesome shoes. Fitting for a movie that exists only to separate you from your paycheck."

Really, I shouldn't hate it so much but I find it so offensive and mind numbingly stupid. This isn't like Showgirls or The Room where it's so bad it's funny. This is a movie I WISH I could forget but for some reason I can't.\r Why? Why do people like this? How can anyone like this? I was shocked by how many people liked Sucker Punch, but at least I get the appeal. This? No. What is there to like about it?\r I wish I could give specific instances of horribleness but there are too many and I get too angry whenever I think about this awful, awful movie. Everything from the acting to the characters to the humor to the message (which is done horribly) even to the fashion is awful. Most people probably won't agree but for me, this is Catwoman awful, the worst kind of awful movie there is.\r Do NOT see this movie under any circumstances. If you child begs you to see this,  say, \"No. We're not watching that garbage.\"",

The voice acting was so, so awful. The accent from the girls was cliché, and sounded absolutely atrocious. Oh boy the migraine I had after 10 minutes was insane. The soundtrack was also so horrendous, I wanted to throw up. It sounded like a 7 year old My Little Pony fangirl's wet dream. The plot was a sad excuse for a movie, and should be forgotten. The scenes were dragged out, unfunny, and were a waste of time. The movie was a terrible execution of a terrible idea. As a kid and adult, I can always agree that this is the worst film in history, and it would be hard to top that **** award. I am not trying to be rude, or negatively biased, I am only trying to be rational, and follow my opinion. It was an over-the-top, depressingly bad, piece of ear rape piled in a nearly 2 hour film.
