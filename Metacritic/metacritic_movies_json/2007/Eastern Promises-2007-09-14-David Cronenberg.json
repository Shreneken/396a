  "summary": "The mysterious and charismatic Russian-born Nikolai Luzhin is a driver for one of London's most notorious organized crime families of Eastern European origin. The family is part of the Vory V Zakone criminal brotherhood. Headed by Semyon--whose courtly charm as the welcoming proprietor of the plush Trans-Siberian restaurant impeccably masksThe mysterious and charismatic Russian-born Nikolai Luzhin is a driver for one of London's most notorious organized crime families of Eastern European origin. The family is part of the Vory V Zakone criminal brotherhood. Headed by Semyon--whose courtly charm as the welcoming proprietor of the plush Trans-Siberian restaurant impeccably masks a cold, brutal core--the family is tested by Semyon's volatile son and enforcer, Kirill, who is more tightly bound to Nikolai than to his own father. But Nikolai's carefully maintained existence is jarred once he crosses paths at Christmastime with Anna Khitrova, a midwife at a North London hospital. Anna is deeply affected by the desperate situation of a young teenager who dies while giving birth to a baby. Anna resolves to try to trace the baby's lineage and relatives. The girl's personal diary also survives her, which is written in Russian; thus, Anna seeks answers in it.  Anna's mother, Helen, does not discourage her, but Anna's irascible Russian-born uncle Stepan urges caution. He is right to do so: By delving into the diary, Anna has accidentally unleashed the full fury of the Vory. [Focus Features]… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Cronenberg's deeper purpose is to pull audiences into an affecting, powerful story about right and wrong.",
    "The actors and the characters merge and form a reality above and apart from the story, and the result is a film that takes us beyond crime and London and the Russian mafia and into the mystifying realms of human nature.",
    "One of Cronenberg's subtlest, most insinuating pictures, and one of the highlights of the year so far.",
    "Cronenberg has, as Guillermo del Toro did in \"Pan's Labyrinth,\" crafted both a drama and a fairy tale -- and he's done it in an entertainment as cracking as you could wish for.",
    "A superbly wrought yarn set in the milieu of first-generation Russian mobsters in London that is simultaneously tough-minded and compassionate about the human condition, Eastern Promises instantly takes its place among David Cronenberg's very best films.",
    "A rhapsodic movie directed with considerable formal intelligence and brooding power from an original screenplay by Steve Knight, Eastern Promises is very much a companion to \"A History of Violence.\"",
    "A dark and mesmerizing immersion into a distinctive world.",
    "Cronenberg and screenwriter Steve Knight masterfully orchestrate an atmosphere of danger and dread for a descent into an underworld inhabited by the Russian mafia in London.",
    "David Cronenberg's elegant treatise on the metaphysics of violence.",
    "Viggo Mortensen's performance is flat-out brilliant, and this relentlessly dramatic thriller represents a mid-life growth spurt for its director, David Cronenberg.",
    "The rigor of Mr. Cronenberg’s direction sometimes seems at odds with the humanism of Mr. Knight’s script, but more often the director’s ruthless formal command rescues the story from its maudlin impulses. Mr. Knight aims earnestly for your heartstrings, but Mr. Cronenberg insists on getting under your skin. The result is a movie whose images and implications are likely to stay in your head for a long time.",
    "Cronenberg's follow-up to \"A History of Violence\" -- starring the same lead, Viggo Mortensen, in a very different part -- lacks the theoretical dimension of its predecessor, but it's no less masterful in its fluid storytelling and shocking choreography of violence.",
    "It's Cronenberg's film, but it's the actors who elevate Eastern Promises from mere thriller to some other, more disturbing plane.",
    "In Eastern Promises, shot to envelop by the great Peter Suschitzky, Cronenberg brings us face to face with the horror of self.",
    "An unusually strong crime thriller, Eastern Promises comes from director David Cronenberg, a meticulous old-school craftsman of a type that is becoming increasingly rare.",
    "Even with his clothes on, this is Mortensen's best and richest performance, worthy of serious awards consideration. He lends a moral complexity to Eastern Promises that makes it much more than just a very accomplished action thriller.",
    "An icily seductive parable about family, power, unconventional justice and the perils of answered prayers.",
    "This is the first time, though, his (Mortensen)performance seemed so much bigger than the film surrounding it. That he manages the feat with so few wasted gestures puts him in line with the greats.",
    "The restraint of both director and actor makes this steely gangster drama reverberate long after it ends. This kind of mystery is rare in a film culture that demands answers before the credits roll.",
    "Expertly realized and gunmetal slick, Eastern Promises whirs along with perfect efficiency, but doesn't stir much in the way of visceral horror despite its penchant for treating the human body like a chicken carcass on a block. (Squeamishness, yes.)",
    "A genuinely engrossing film.",
    "It's an academic meditation in underworld-thriller drag -- a movie that looks about as close to a straight-ahead, down-and-dirty genre entertainment as anything the director has made since his exploding-head horror days.",
    "An engaging thriller done in the Cronenberg style is still worth anyone's time. And this one boasts memorable turns from Naomi Watts, Armin Mueller-Stahl, and Vincent Cassel.",
    "Eastern Promises has a compelling story and strong performances to back up what may seem excessive or sensationalistic.",
    "What it doesn't have is the resonance of Cronenberg's \"A History of Violence,\" a film that exploited the same genre even while transcending its limitations. Eastern Promises delivers, but not on that scale.",
    "The first must-see adult film of the young fall.",
    "A thoroughly entertaining film by a director at the height of his ability.",
    "The violence here is never in the service of spectacle, always of the story.",
    "Here is an excellent crime thriller made with grown-ups in mind: Yep, it must definitely be fall.",
    "It’s engrossing, and Mueller-Stahl’s mix of Old World chivalry and murderousness is scarier than Jason and Freddy combined.",
    "Cronenberg made a movie called “The Dead Zone,” and I sometimes wonder whether, for all his formal brilliance, he has ever torn himself away from that locked-in, airless state of mind. You walk out of Eastern Promises feeling spooked and sullied, as if waking from a noisome dream.",
    "Cronenberg has a distinctive style – deadpan absurdism laced with fright and all executed with slow deliberation. But too much of Eastern Promises is cultish and silly.",
    "Mortensen shines but a contrived, issue-driven plot destabilises what could have been a great Russian gangster movie.",
    "Eastern Promises is a jumbled string of mob-related clichés that mesh into something that’s derivative and at times uninteresting.",
    "Eastern Promises is intensely anti-dramatic."

Yes, there are certain gaps in the script that are never brought to light, but to focus only on that is to miss the entire point of the film. It's not attempting to be an episode of CSI. It's more of an exploration of the polarities between right and wrong. It reveals humanity in the most improbable places. People need to understand that THIS IS A MOVIE. A piece of art is not intended to immaculately recreate reality, but rather illuminate an underlying message. So, to anyone reading this, do yourself a favor and focus on the poignancy of the story as opposed to the forensic inconsistencies. This is a great, worthwhile film, with superb acting by Mortensen to boot.",

Watching the film a second time, you can really pick up on many of the subtleties that reflect the complexity and brilliance of all the aspects of this film.

It takes place in one room, with no props except for a couple knives. People in the audience at the screening I attended were flinching and gasping as if they were being punched in the face. Which, of course, is the idea. If a fight scene doesn't make you feel like you're part of it, so that it quickens your heartbeat and your breathing, then it's a failure. And Cronenberg's makes you realize how many movie fights are flops -- and how really hard it is to kill or immobilize a human being with your arms, legs, feet and hands. Literally and figuratively, \"Eastern Promises\" has guts. And in this sense, it reminds me of both the excruciatingly protracted struggle between Paul Newman and the Russian agent in \"Torn Curtain,\" and the knock-down, drag-out fist-fest between Keith David and Rowdy Roddy Piper in John Carpenter's \"They Live! Directed in a bold, graphic style similar to that of his previous film, \"A History of Violence,\" \"Eastern Promises\" is shockingly gorgeous, for all the ugliness it portrays. The film is set in London, and the colors are dark and heavy: gray skies, slick black streets, brandy, absinthe, venous blood. A hospital midwife (Naomi Watts) finds a patient's diary that gets her involved with Russian gangsters -- in particular, a shrewd and ambitious chauffeur played by \"History of Violence\" star Viggo Mortensen. It begins like a Cronenbergian horror movie, and becomes... a Cronenberg gangster movie -- an elemental struggle between good and evil, life and death, east and west, blood and money, trust and betrayal, commerce and morality, mind and body. Remember, that's \"elemental,\" not \"simplistic.\" There are... complications.",

If there is one thing Cronenburg is so good at, its taking a movie beyond the limits of being just a movie. It is more a study of the human being, and their behaviors and nature, and how they act and who they are, and who they pretend to be. This movie takes you into the lives of the Russian mob, a very dark, disturbing place to be, and a family of a young woman (played by Naomi Watts), her uncle and aunt find themselves thrown into the chaos. They discover a diary of a young prostitute, and this diary has a lot of power in this movie. Muehller-Stahl, who plays the leader of the vory V Zakone brotherhood, is absolutely terrific, and can shoot one glance that could freeze you, and then cut you to pieces. He is menacing, not in his actions, but in his look alone. Also, Viggo Mortensen delivers the performance of his life, playing this mysterious, off-put, odd friend of the son of the brotherhood leader. He can exude both evil, and kindness in just a few different shots. The action in the movie is real, and it is haunting, and one scene in particular will most likely stick with you in your head for quite some time. This is a movie to be taken seriously, and deep, deep under its seemingly simple layers of story, lies a very interesting tale that leads through the cobwebs of the Russian mob, and just what happens when family is messed with. This is a very good piece on humanity, and it is something not to be missed at a time when all Hollywood can chock up are lame Dane Cook films and same-old same-old \"kill the zombie\" movies.",

For someone who grew up watching the cartoon, the movie was a dream come true, and I also believe Michael Bay(the director) put a lot of us to shame by delivering a worthy product ... but I digress. My intention is to share thoughts on movies I love like the one I just saw, and ones I truly loathe and would gladly request for $9 back...case in point - \"The Reaping\" \"Eastern Promises\" is movie directed by David Cronenberg. You may remember him from \"A History of Violence\". Every one remembers that movie...Seeing Maria Bello in her cheer leader outfit alone was worth the price of admission... then there was the sex scene on the steps. I suggest you rent or purchase it immediately. Back to \"Eastern Promises\"...The main actors are Viggo Mortensen, Naomi Watts, Vincent Cassel and Armin Mueller-Stahl; I'll get to information about their performances soon enough. Without giving much away, the story is basically about a nurse who unfortunately witnesses a 14 year old Russian girl giving birth and dying during labor. She embarks on a quest to find out more about the girl's family and also have her diary translated. On the nurse's quest of discovery, she ends up getting involved with some really vile people, mainly the Russian crime family - Vory V Zakone. The rest of the movie unravels the mystery behind the dead girl, and eventually the father of the baby.Warning! If you are not a fan of violent movies, you will not enjoy this movie. There's enough extreme violence to make the toughest guy squirm. One scene in the steam room is particularly disturbing to watch. I was impressed by all the actors. Naomi Watts, who I last saw playing the love interest of a mega-sized gorilla, put on quite a performance. Her character is the nurse who drove the story, but this is not a role she'll be remembered for...Armin Mueller-Stahl plays the owner of a restaurant and is also affiliated with the Vory V Zakone. Vincent Cassel plays his crazy son Kirill, who much to his father's chagrin, is also rumored to be gay. The true star of the movie is Viggo, who plays Nikolai, a mysterious driver who definitely wants to move up in the family. His russian is fluent, and his accent is perfect. It's almost hard to imagine him speaking in another accent after this movie. He accent and grammar really did sound like his spoke a Slavic language natively. It was very interesting to watch him play his role so flawlessly. In all, this was a pretty good movie. I believe David Cronenberg and Viggo should make more movies together. They certainly have a formula that works.",

Why bother trying to explain that? 4) It is filled with lame cliches about Russia-- The only 2 Russian cliches they forgot was Dolph Lundgren and Boris and Natasia from Rocky And Bullwinkle 3) It is filled with Homosexual inuendos-- Naked men fighting and dudes watching each other bone-- ri-frickin-diculous 2) it would be pointlessly disturbing at times if it wasn't so hilarious-- verbally- characters say randomly racist things and there is random gory parts that would be borderline gross but ends up looking silly- Like Leprechaun 2 Gore- so unbelievable it is funny but not in a good way. and the #1 reason is. IT IS BORING__ OH MAN IS IT BORING!!!! From bad lighting to juvenile dialog there isn't one thing uttered in this film that is memorable or poignant. I have seen adult films with better writing.

The entire film is premised on the ridiculous notion of the Watts character actually going to a location mentioned in the diary of a young girl who died under very unusual circumstances, and then mentioning the diary--when she has people in her OWN FAMILY who are Russian and could translate it!

Naomi Watts would have been the ideal woman for Alfred Hitchcock. She plays a British nurse looking the family of dead Russian girl amid the mob, and there's something less-than-classic about her face and modern about her independence. She's like this perfectly woven garment of emotional temperatures -- hot and cold all the time. The hot part has never come naturally to Nicole Kidman, who's got the mechanics of Grace Kelly, Janet Leigh, and Tippi Hedren (chilly, cold, frozen). Watts evokes them in a more organically intelligent way. She seems to be feeling and thinking, especially in this movie, which requires her to be defensively tough and a little naive at the same time. Sorry I'm not making this entirely clear, but Cronenberg seems to get that Watts has an internal universe -- she's the Hitchcock heroine remixed. He also understands that Viggo Mortensen is the most sexually alive man not currently doing porn. Mortensen is one of those actors who gets more convincing, more soulful with age (he'll be 49 next month). Between this movie and \"A History of Violence,\" Cronenberg really sees Mortensen as an intensely erotic figure (he plays a mob family's ornately tattooed driver). The movie purports to be about Russian gangsters in London, but like \"A History of Violence,\" \"Eastern Promises\" is more interesting for what's beneath the surfaces. And like the other movie, that usually culminates in some bundling of sex, violence, and Viggo. Here, there's a brawl in a bathhouse between Mortensen and two goons that's one of the most astounding fight sequences I've ever seen. Both the sexual context and Mortensen's nudity are neutralized - and yet unmistakably present. The grunting, slapping of flesh on the tiles, explosive exhalations, and brute force are more visceral than erotic (it's way more excruciating than it ever is arousing). And yet Cronenberg jokingly refuses to stop teasing us with the eroticism while astounding you with the brutality, the way a bloodied Mortensen crawls across bodies. It's loaded -- a brilliant, unspoken mini-essay on what movie violence can be and often essentially is: a bunch of dudes rolling around on the floor.",

Also the initiation itself is quite funny since all they do is call his father a coward and his mother a wh*re, and thats it! He is accepted as a high ranking spawn of a spineless coward and a prostitute. Enjoy!

Although the director has re-teamed with his The History ofEastern Promises is the latest effort from acclaimed filmmaker David Cronenberg, whose recent work has elevated his status from that of a cult figure to someone in the mainstrem. Although the director has re-teamed with his The History of Violence star, Viggo Mortensen, the results aren’t as satisfactory. Eastern Promises is a jumbled string of mob-related clichés that mesh into something that’s derivative and at times uninteresting. Aside from two “Cronenberg” scenes, the movie is lifeless and concludes on a note that makes the movie feel unfinished. I have been complaining about a lot of the movies at this festival being needlessly long; Eastern Promises might have been a better production had it added another 15 or 20 minutes on the back end, beefing up an anticlimactic finale.\r Naomi Watts is Anna, a midwife at a London hospital. After delivering a baby for an unwed mother who dies in childbirth, Anna goes in search of the girl’s living relatives. Her quest unexpectedly brings her into contact with the Russian mob, presided over by the kingpin, a restaurant owner named Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), and his creepy son (Vincent Cassel). They pretend to be nice to her, but their goal is to obtain an incriminating diary possessed by the dead mother. To do their dirty work, they employ Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), whose official role is as Semyon’s driver, but who is also referred to as “the undertaker.” Nikolai has his own secrets, not the least of which is a desire to depose Semyon and replace him upon the throne of the Russian criminal underworld in London.\r Eastern Promises concentrates on two basic plots, neither of which radiates originality. The first pertains to Anna’s near-obsessive need to find a family for the motherless baby. We learn that she lost a child and so relates to the newborn on a maternal level. Then there’s the crime element of the story, which includes gamesmanship among the gangsters to see who will ultimately end up on top. The “surprise” twist (which won’t be unexpected to some viewers) introduces more problems than it solves and leads in part to the incomplete feeling that accompanies the ending.\r Cronenberg delivers twice when it comes to gore and violence. The movie opens with one of these trademark scenes as a man’s throat is slit while he’s in a barber’s chair. (Encouragement to tip well.) Later, there’s a no holds-barred two-on-one between Nikolai and a couple of thugs. What makes this interesting is that Viggo Mortensen is naked for the entire battle. This is one of those rare movies when there’s plenty of male nudity as Mortensen literally lets it all hang out. (Hetero men will be glad to know that there are a few bare breasts here and there, although none belongs to Naomi Watts.) Sadly, those are the only two sequences likely to remind the viewer that he or she is watching a Cronenberg movie. The rest of what’s on offer - including everything related to Anna - is banal. Perhaps the director set the bar so high with The History of Violence (a flawed but at times brilliant motion picture) that there was no way he could equal it with Eastern Promises, but for him to fall so far short is nothing less than criminal.",

His simplicity, and even cliches, has a panache that any filmmaker would die to have for. His lucid flow on storytelling is why it all looks so simple and easy. He doesn't rely much upon antics, but when there are their to work upon, he makes sure he builds them up sincerely and weaves them out sharply on the screen. Take the holy ceremonial or mythological ritual sequence that these gangs go through before claiming their titles or roles in their community. That entire sequence where Mortensen surrenders himself to their religion or the game that they believe in and feed themselves in, says a lot about the integrity of these characters.These tiny characteristics of the characters is why we care, this attractive nature of theirs makes us root for them from the start. There isn't much action in the film, but only once does Mortensen throws a punch, and that entire sequence is not only well choreographed and shot but also brilliantly performed. Nikolai; the protagonist, played powerfully by Viggo Mortensen is not your average Godfather-like mafia member, he wants to prove himself and he does.Naomi Watts cloaking as Anna, the sort-of voice of the reason of the film has unfortunately very less to invest. In fact, Vincent Cassel as a spoiled brat has much more threat to convey with his uncertainty. Stephen Knight, the writer, is not overprotective or melodramatic about his content, he gives up easily but wisely, he makes sure that there is another surprising layer attached to it, to ground the emotions and justify these killings. Eastern Promises has a promising premise, scoffing off the usual crime drama rigmarole, David Cronenberg focuses on the heart of these characters.",

This film is very good at immersing us in that universe, and David Cronenberg wasI confess that I expected less from this movie. I really like movies set in the mob world, but the Russian mob was something I had rarely seen on film before. This film is very good at immersing us in that universe, and David Cronenberg was happy in the way he carried out this project, a little out of his usual record.The film follows a London nurse, Anna, on her quest to find out more about the young mother of a baby she saw born, who appears to have been a prostitute from the East. The essential clues will come from a diary, kept by the teenager, which will link her to a respectable and wealthy Russian family, residing in London, who are behind a powerful branch of the Russian mafia in the United Kingdom. The script, engaging and intelligent, seems credible and logical most of the time, and manages to engage the audience and instigate our curiosity. One thing I particularly have to praise is the recurrent use of Russian and Ukrainian in the film, a feature that may confuse the minds of Anglophone audiences, but which I found excellent, appropriate and intelligent, insofar as the actors did it well, without it ever sounding fake or forced. The highlight of the film is the action scenes, and particularly the fight in the Turkish baths, starring Mortensen. From there, the film continues and maintains our interest, but it fails to give us something as intense or exciting.For me, and if we exclude the films from the \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"Hobbit\" trilogies, this is the biggest and best film in Viggo Mortensen's career so far. I also liked his work on \"Hidalgo\", but I think he surpassed it here. I don't know how far his character was supposed to have the charisma he gave him, but Mortensen was able to dominate the film with a magnetic, powerful and intriguing performance. Another actor who did an excellent job was veteran Armin Mueller Stahl, in the role of the family patriarch who is the center of this film. He seems affectionate and kind, refined and very courteous, but he hides a dark, brutal and cynical side. Initially, I found Vincent Cassel a bit one-dimensional with his character too brutal and violent, but I believe the actor knew how to work that out and effectively solve the problems that the character posed to him. Paradoxically, and despite being the main character par excellence, it's Naomi Watts who went out of her way in this film, with a character who seems to be limited to following the flow of information and who doesn't seem to have much else to do in the movie. Still a word for the good work of Sinéad Cusack and Jerzy Skolimowski, as Anna's parents.Technically, it's a film that has many points of interest, starting with a well-placed and regular pace, through elegant cinematography and a judicious choice of filming locations. Visually, it's a beautiful movie that is pleasing to the eye. The sound also works very well, and the visual, specials and sound effects, punctually placed, are of quality and work well. The costumes and sets are very good, but they are within an expected standard, and the soundtrack, written by Howard Shore, didn't sound as good as I could demand in a film with so many qualities.",
