  "critic_reviews": [
    "Frankly, it's dumb, but no dumber than \"Transformers.\"",
    "A feast of A-grade f/x married to a Z-grade, irony-free script.",
    "It is such a breathless, delirious stew, it’s impossible not to be entertained, provided -- this is crucial -- you have a sense of humor.",
    "While the CGI effects are undeniably impressive, the laughable story line, risible dialogue and cheap humor (most of it involving a hapless zoo security guard) seriously detract from the fun.",
    "You don't have to hand the folks behind Dragon Wars much (the acting, directing, costumes, editing, props, music, etc: They're all off). But when they decide to sic that giant snake and those prehistoric dino-birds on downtown Los Angeles, the movie turns shockingly watchable.",
    "This one’s for connoisseurs of the “totally preposterous crap” school of fantasy cinema.",
    "Fluent in the laughable dialogue of a million bad fantasy flicks:",
    "This South Korean pseudo-epic is some of the most ambitious cr-- I've ever seen.",
    "All the thought seems to have gone into the marketing, and none into the unfathomably terrible script."

And that includes \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.\" There is no story structure. There is no attempt to make you empathize with the main characters. You get slammed with a half-hour of exposition at the beginning, and it's bad exposition. It's so confusing that you have no idea what they were trying to set up in the first place. The next quarter of the film is devoted to a bunch of cuts between the male lead and the female lead, while the male lead looks for her. Then there's a battle between fantasy creatures and modern military technology in the middle of LA, with total disregard for civilian life by the military. The chopper pilots are hilariously bad. I feel like this sequence was one of the major reasons this film was made. You can tell the director liked it, because you see the main characters for all of two minutes in this roughly 20 minute battle. Oh, and another thing. This movie fails at creating tension in every way imagineable. I know every movie does this, but none so blatant as this one. When the bad guy is two feet from his goal, and he just stands there and stares at his goal, easily within reach... WHY NOT STRIKE ALREADY!? That happens maybe 10 times in the entire film. The special effects amalgam at the end between the two giant serpents, good and evil, is also something that you can tell the director really wanted to do. Too bad it fails for using special effects on par with a film like Independence Day, an 11-year-old film. Aside from all of these flaws, add in non-sequitur dialog that is badly delivered, a \"tragic\" ending that is practically joyous when the credits roll, and a bad guy with dubbed Korean lines who overacts like it's going out of style, and you have what can easily be called the worst movie ever made. I honestly don't know what studio in their right mind would've picked this one up. Don't waste your time or money. I would've walked out on this movie if I hadn't been there with friends.",

After watching this total piece of crap I can see why. No doubt this movie was never screened because the producers of this debacle must have known the film was going to get savaged by the critics and the general public alike. The only reason I took the time to write a review on this waste of celluloid was after reading others express that this was the worst film they had ever seen as well. Reading others write the very thing I was feeling was very therapeutic for me. Just knowing that others saw this movie as I did made me feel a little better. I guess misery does love company after all! The only good thing to be said about this piece of total crap was that the special effects were pretty amazing. That being said it still was not enough to raise my review above \"zero\"! You truly would have to have the I.Q. of a common house plant in order to enjoy this movie. Everyone else run for the hills on this one!",

The reason for this review is that the past few reviews have been generally solid titles. As a man with very limited resources, I try to filter through the oceans of crap released by companies and spend my hard-earned dollars on media I know I will enjoy. Dragon Wars was a free DVD, meaning I could sample it without damaging my checkbook, as well as take an unbiased look at a movie that has been universally hated, to see if I agreed. After seeing the movie, I can tell you that not only were the critics right, they were being soft on the producers.    Dragon Wars is, without question, the most lopsided movie I have seen in years. I started the movie expecting that the majority of the budget would be spent on special effects; I did not, however, prepare myself for the level of crap that the movie would fling at me. From a broken storyline, to poorly executed scenes designed for character development, this movie was far and beyond what could be considered as a movie released for a quick buck.    The story loosely follows a young girl in Korea some thousand years ago, who was cursed to be eaten by one of two dragons, one apparently being designated â",

If I can spare but ONE person from wasting 90 minutes of their life, by keeping them from watching this unwatchable piece of trash, then my job here is done. Essentially, it's: Boy finds out about girl, boy finds girl, girl holds the mystical \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\" or whatever, boy and girl flee evil forces, girl eventually is sacrificed to the good \"Omura\" (or whatever), boy stands alone (since the theater has since been emptied). First, I will say the opening started off with an old man faking a heart attack in front of a boy's father; sending the father off for 'help' as an excuse to explain to the boy that he's a re-incarnation of a 'protector' from 1507 a.d. Korea. Next was a pitched battle scene from that same era, and that actually fooled me into thinking this could be an interesting movie. How wrong I was. To me, it all went downhill from there. This film tries to invoke imagery from such classics as \"The Neverending Story\", \"Dragonheart\", and even \"Raiders Of The Lost Ark\". However, I'm left debating whether this was actually worse than \"Reign Of Fire\". From the moment I first saw the 'evil dragon', I had my doubts, and they were satisfied. Instead of wings on the side of it's head, there's a 'hood' similar to that which cobras exhibit. There are even mild attempts at comedy relief, and those failed miserably. Solid 1.0 rating material if I've even seen it (and trust me...I have).",
