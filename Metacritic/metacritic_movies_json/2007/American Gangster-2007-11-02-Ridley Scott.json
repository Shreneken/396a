But when his boss suddenly dies, Frank exploits the opening in the power structure to build his own empire and create his own version of the American Dream. Through ingenuity and a strict business ethic, he comes to rule the inner-city drug trade and floods the streets with a purer product at a better price. Lucas outplays all of the leading crime syndicates and becomes not only one of the city's mainline corrupters, but part of its circle of legit civic superstars. Richie Roberts is an outcast cop close enough to the streets to feel a shift of control in the drug underworld. Roberts believes someone is climbing the rungs above the known Mafia families and starts to suspect that a black power player has come from nowhere to dominate the scene. Both Lucas and Roberts share a rigorous ethical code that sets them apart from their own colleagues, which makes them lone figures on opposite sides of the law. The destinies of these two men will become intertwined as they approach a confrontation in which only one of them can come out on top. [Universal]… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Denzel Washington dazzles in his best screen performance to date as Frank Lucas.",
    "This is an engrossing story, told smoothly and well, and Russell Crowe's contribution is enormous.",
    "It has the aspirations of an epic of crime and punishment, a superb feel for time and milieu, and an almost subliminal feel for myth.",
    "Finely made and richly satisfying film.",
    "Crowe has rarely been better, and the same goes for director Scott, who parallels and then dovetails Lucas and Roberts' stories with sublime, gritty precision, working up to a magnificent \"Godfather III\"-style crosscutting sequence that electrifies an already explosive tale.",
    "Call it the black \"Scarface\" or \"the Harlem Godfather\" or just one hell of an exciting movie.",
    "The movie, based on a true story, takes surprising twists and turns right up to its chilling ending and is probably the best gangster crime drama of the year.",
    "What American Gangster does have -- what makes it such a commanding, exhilarating movie -- is a consummate love and understanding of story.",
    "Only Washington stands out; he's charming, intense, and charismatic as ever.",
    "A riveting piece of movie storytelling, mounted with a genuinely epic flair, shot and edited in a no-nonsense, classic style.",
    "This impressive film feels more like a display, if an often dazzling one, than a genuine experience.",
    "It's workmanlike and engrossing, but what sticks in the mind are Frank and Richie, not what anybody does.",
    "Absorbing, exciting at times and undeniably entertaining, and is poised to be a major commercial hit. But great it's not.",
    "The pace of the movie is rapid, almost hectic, the touch glancing. Until the confrontation between Frank and Richie at the end, nothing stays on the screen for long, although Scott, working in the street, or in clubs and at parties, packs as much as he can into the corners of shots, and shapes even the most casual scenes decisively.",
    "As archetypal as its title, Ridley Scott's would-be epic aspires to enshrine Harlem dope king Frank Lucas in Hollywood heaven, heir to Scarface and the Godfather. Or, as suggested by the Mark Jacobson article on Lucas that inspired the movie, a real-life Superfly.",
    "In the end, though, the success of American Gangster doesn't flow from the originality of its ideas, or its bid for epic status, as much as from its craftsmanship and confident professionalism. It's a great big gangster film, and a good one.",
    "I don't think it attains the Godfather level -- it lacks dark passion and grand-scale irony -- but it is an intelligent, well-made and seductive movie.",
    "Like in \"Training Day\" and \"Malcolm X,\" where he portrayed less than perfect individuals, Washington rules the screen. His portrayal is one of many things that elevates this film to the level of being consistently entertaining and occasionally compelling.",
    "Meticulous and detailed, a drug-world epic that holds you from moment to moment, immersing you in the intricate and sleazy logistics of crime. Yet the movie isn't quite enthralling; it's more like the ghost version of a '70s classic.",
    "Often best around the edges. Without making a big deal about it, Scott reveals how the Mafia, while putting up a businesslike front, deplored the incursion of black gangsters into the drug trade.",
    "Its vivid sense of place and time make it compulsively watchable, even at a running time of two and a half hours.",
    "It’s a big, juicy 1970s period piece, one foot in real life, the other in the movies, the preferred stance of many Hollywood crime sagas.",
    "As an epic, American Gangster doesn't cut it. The reputations of Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather,\" Brian De Palma's \"Scarface,\" Martin Scorsese's \"Goodfellas\" or Michael Mann's \"Heat\" are safe. At best, American Gangster is no better than a workmanlike imitation of its betters.",
    "It lacks momentum, and thus the propulsion required to rocket it into the movie mythosphere.",
    "Ridley Scott gives it the grand treatment, 157 minutes worth, but in the end, it doesn't stack up as the portrait of an era (the 1970s, in this case) or an important tale of a criminal mastermind.",
    "For all the sprawl, American Gangster feels secondhand. It’s like \"Scarface\" drained of blood, at arm’s length from the culture that spawned it.",
    "The movie is never quite pop enough to get audiences hooting and hollering and quoting favorite lines, nor smart enough to inspire passionate post-movie debate. Scene by scene, the film is unassailably well-crafted. But there's something oddly dull, even respectable, about Scott's adherence to the rules of gangster-film grammar.",
    "Greatness hovers just outside American Gangster, knocking, angling to be let in.",
    "With one of these two alpha males anchoring nearly every scene, Scott really can't go wrong, but the lead characters are pretty thin, a fact highlighted by generic subplots.",
    "There's a great story here, but it feels like American Gangster hasn't been mined for all its riches.",
    "The acting is unquestionably strong, the songs are integrated appropriately (functioning as both audio bridges and dramatic enhancements), and yet something is missing in how the individual pieces of the film--the story, the themes, and the violence--fit together.",
    "The new perspective Scott and Zaillian want to bring to this material never gels convincingly, and despite some effective set pieces, a cast of memorable faces and attitudes, and evocative cinematography by Harris Savides, this would-be epic feels tired and rote.",
    "Steven Zaillian never seems completely at home with these characters, not because he's white but because he's a cerebral screenwriter frustrated with a story that gives him little that's meaningful to say. Like Washington and Crowe, he's a chef functioning here as a short-order cook: The meal's perfectly edible but falls short of delicious.",
    "The result is kitschy entertainment that wants to celebrate Lucas's chutzpah and acumen while loosely condemning what they wrought: \"Scarface\" with a ghost of a conscience.",
    "The problem is that the movie spends as much time on the boring detective chasing Lucas as on the drug lord himself.",
    "An entertaining romp through familiar cop-and-crim cat-and-mousery, bolstered by strong star turns from Washington and Crowe. Still, it has neither the intelligence nor the grip to jump from the merely good to the truly great.",
    "Misplaced hero-worship and glibness get in the way of its amazing true story.",
    "Offers only the stingiest platform for its actors, and as a piece of storytelling -- built on the foundation of a great story -- it's an epic that's been sliced and diced into so many little morsels that almost nothing in it has any weight."

These actors have finally collided into an \"American Gangster!\" Who wouldn't enjoy a film directed by Ridley Scott, the director of Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven, and Oscar winning starts, Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. These actors have finally collided into an electrifying performance. I saw the poster of this film in a run down theatre and it looked pretty exciting because at the time, I was into Scorsese Mob films, and the title said: American Gangster Starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. What I film. After watching the trailer, I couldn't wait a damn moment until it came out. All these sweat and awesome commercials viewing it, my god, I wanted to watch it so badly. But apparently, I saw it in a special screening a week before it came out. There were lots of folks there from all walks of life and all ages - the movie seemed to go over very well with everyone in the room. Washington and Crowe work well together as the troubled stars in this film and basically the main attraction for people to go see it was their appearance. It was also a little too long and more dramatic than expected, but it still had good dialogue to make it entertaining. Also, I've seen some real stinkers at the movies recently (I won't bother you with the list because it's too long) so it was refreshing to see that movies can still be well made with characters you can care about and root for. Since the movie wasn't finished at the time I got to see it, I look forward to enjoying the movie again at local movie theatre. A pure modern-gangster classic.",

But in connecting the dots you find there are some dots missing. The end feels like an uneasy compromise for the film's length and had enough morla and character content to have filled another movie. The relationship and respect between Russel Crowe and Denzel was a refreshing idea, and could have floated a boat in itself. The relationship at the beginning with his boss gets your attention and feels important and intrigues you, but those elements are left to just taper off. Perhaps a prequel and a sequel were aces up the sleeve of the film from the very beginning. A taunting idea, yet doubtful. Still, even with a tease of a start and a rush of an end, the middle should not be ignored. Solid and very respectable. A must-see for sure.",

Because I know that we're dealing with fine actors and one of the best directors of all time, I have to blame the script-- It gives none of its actors a platform to create a character or a sentiment that we care about. It's all facts. But even if it was a documentary, it still wouldn't be a good one. Information you don't need is all over and information you want is lacking. Plot points are explained in 30 second sequences and then left. There is not one single moment in this movie where I felt the least bit connected to these characters.

Ironically,Empty Threats. Empty Guns.American GangsterScott's reign over the mean streets often comes out as a fatal attempt of conjuring Scorsese's richness on uncouth mannerism, either way it's a big old sunken ship from the beginning. Ironically, despite of ticking for more than two hours, it barely offers us the content of half an hour, give or take. The major disappointment is the build up of each sequences, which are perpetually on mark, but unfortunately the high pitched dramatic scene itself falls on mediocrity. Against all odds, the film is cornered by its semantics, since the biggest bombshell would be Zaillian; the writer, who has managed to write the weakest script of his career.As far as Scott- behind the camera- is concerned, he does utilize the caliber of the cast to the last drop, but there isn't enough concrete material to walk on. Washington, in the bad boy coat, is a threat to watch out for, his rage empowers not only on the characters but on the viewers too. And to balance the tone on the other side is, Crowe as the complex yet better person to root on, frankly his personal life has much more to offer than his professional, no matter how much limited it is.Spicing up their relationship, lies Brolin's challenging performance that is explored the least among all. Despite of having such an electrifying performances, the conversation aren't zazzy enough to spark up the screen as it was anticipated and the apt example would be when Brolin and Washington goes head to head; the trash talk is just not working. And the rest of the time is spent upon creating the stereotypical montages like the loss of consciousness, the rudimentary investigation process and an imperial party gone wrong.

Surely, the actual events the film is based on carried more insight, intrigue, intensity and human emotion than what is presented on screen. I love a lot of Ridley Scott's films, Bladerunner, White Squall, Aliens, you name it, but what made those films great and entertaining was their fresh look and depth - depth for detail and fashion, but also character depth. Denzel Washington's character is given presidential treatment here, and the film makes the case for Frank Lucas as a modern day hero. Offensive to me as a black man, that a drug dealer who smuggled heroin in the coffins of U.S. soldiers is immortalized in such a positive light. But besides the ethical questions, the film is all style, boring structure and faux important. Gangster films can be great, but this is posturing. Admit it.",

But I definitely felt every single one of those 157 minutes. I was psyched going into this movie, but I left feeling tired and slightly irritated. What was the movie about? I don't know, and I don't think Ridley Scott knew either. It's very disjointed and, to me, slightly racist. There didn't seem to be an argument being made, nor was there any definitive through-line. I wanted to care more about Washington's character, but the film wouldn't let me, and I wanted to be more angry at Crowe's character, but he kept being vindicated like a saint. The only message I got in the end was that the good white cop will always win. And that irritated me severely. In conclusion, it was too many characters, not enough plot development, and no message, not even a morally ambiguous one. I realize that it's based on real life, but that's no excuse for shoddy storytelling.",

It's I guess I can understand what David Edelstein is saying in his review, but he's not understanding what the point of the movie is. It's not about blood, or long violent scenes like Scarface(that's what sells, right?). It's about history. It's also about telling the truth while keeping it interesting. Weird, isn't it? This movie is not \"rapid\" or \"hectic\", it's perfect in pace. Is it \"poised to be a major commercial hit\"? Depends on your definition of poised. This movie certainly has what it takes to get under the skin of the average movie goer, and still entertain those who truly love Hollywood when it allows real style and grace to the surface, while still shocking us with truth. Washington is as good as he'll ever be, and, don't fool yourself for a moment, he'll get a best actor nod for this. Crowe is a little light, but being honest isn't supposed to be any other way. He'll get a nod for supporting actor. The movie will surely be on the \"best\" list as well, and it deserves to be. A true American Classic!",
