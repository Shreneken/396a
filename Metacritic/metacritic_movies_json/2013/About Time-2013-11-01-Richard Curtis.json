    "critic_reviews": [
        "The movie moves episodically, leisurely, through roughly a decade, and that feels like a gift: to nestle in with these extraordinary, ordinary people and get to know them.",
        "About Time is ... about time: It asks us to reflect on how we all use that resource, how the hours and minutes that make up a day or a life align with our intentions and values.",
        "Maybe it's a touch twee, but Curtis' film is far too uplifting, too life-affirming and too good-natured to do anything but embrace.",
        "More than just a time-travel rom-com, this is a movie that asks you questions and doesn\u2019t sugar-coat as many of the answers as you\u2019d expect. Smart and sweet, funny and genuinely moving. Should probably come with a \u2018there\u2019s something in my eye\u2019 warning.",
        "What results is amusing, gently entertaining and might induce a tear or two.",
        "For all its glutinous cuteness, damn if About Time doesn\u2019t sneak up and sock you in the tear ducts. I tried not to fall for it. I failed.",
        "The self-consciousness that made the director's \"Love Actually\" a love-it-or-hate-it film is dialed way down. About Time is more of a love-it-or-like-it proposition.",
        "Enjoy the love in your life, and don't squander it: That's all Curtis is selling here, really. With Gleeson and McAdams at the forefront, About Time has a beguiling pair of rom-com miracle workers helping him close the sale.",
        "Gleeson and McAdams make a touching, lifelike couple, but by the time the movie starts telling us to live each day as if we were going back and doing it all over again, you may feel Curtis has mistaken hokum for wisdom.",
        "A most romantic way to spend your time at the movies this fall, a \u201cdate picture\u201d about do over dates that works, this time around.",
        "That messy sprawl makes for a messy film full of highs and lows, triumphs and regrets... But those willing\u2014or eager\u2014to indulge About Time\u2019s schmaltziest moments are rewarded with hits of pure, uncut joy and sorrow.",
        "Curtis ends up making a virtue out of the narrative\u2019s episodic quality, a tendency that\u2019s been criticized in his previous work; the film, like life, is just one damn thing after another, and that\u2019s really the rather lovely point.",
        "The movie is written and directed by the British filmmaker Richard Curtis, who specializes in fantasies \u2014 the dozen intersecting rom-coms of \"Love Actually\" the fairy-tale courtship of \"Notting Hill\", the endless receptions of \"Four Weddings And A Funeral.\" At a glance, About Time appears to be of a piece with those crowd-pleasers.",
        "There\u2019s a lot of comic and fantasy potential here, but much of it gets squandered.",
        "That the stars of the show are none other than the esteemed Richard Griffiths and Richard E. Grant in invaluable cameo roles and that they end up provoking some of the biggest laughs of the movie demonstrates why Curtis is a comedy genius.",
        "Everyone involved is far too talented to mess this up too badly, but it soon becomes clear that Curtis intends to reduce us to quivering sobs mixed with heartfelt gratitude for every blessed day of life.",
        "Curtis pulls off some amusing moments, and he has a secret weapon: Nighy, who is so jolly and funny you wish he\u2019d had more screen time.",
        "A surprisingly thoughtful romantic comedy that shirks a great deal of reason and consequence in the name of love.",
        "It\u2019s not as good, nor as involving, as \u201cLove Actually.\u201d But like that film, it has Bill Nighy, and that\u2019s good for something.",
        "About Time is itself a film less directed than quilted: it\u2019s a feathery old patchwork under which you might snuggle at the end of a tiring week.",
        "There are just enough laugh-out-loud moments here to excuse the lurches into shameless, tear-jerking sentimentality.",
        "There\u2019s a creepy subtext to all this, especially when Tim uses his time-travel gifts to woo an American girl without her assent.",
        "With more attention to detail, this could have worked, but the time travel aspects are so badly executed that the movie as a whole falters and eventually rips apart at the seams.",
        "There are the usual gaggle of embarrassing friends, a lot of voice-over and montages, a wedding, a funeral and wait \u2026 something\u2019s missing. Oh, right. Hugh Grant.",
        "I\u2019m being deliberately mean about a plot device that Curtis wants to come off as a goofy, harmless comic metaphor, but the idea that this implausible inherited trait is actually a cryptic, creepazoid form of domination over women is right there in the movie.",
        "Like a doggie in a window, this romcom relentlessly wags its tail so you'll fall in love and take it home. Not this time, puppy.",
        "About Time is like a sermon that starts with a few good jokes and ends with tremulous exhortations to live, live.",
        "Then Bill Nighy shows up and is awesome and punches you in the heart. It ultimately feels like a cheat, and while there won\u2019t be a dry eye in the house, it won\u2019t be earned.",
        "What makes the calculated sentimentality palatable is Curtis\u2019 intelligent assurance as he guides us through each step. It\u2019s a gooey indulgence, to be sure, but one that will please anybody with a cinematic sweet tooth.",
        "In a word: Ugh.",
        "Curtis's heart is in the right place. In fact, it's all over the place \u2013 front and centre and backlighting the whole thing with a benevolent glow. But it is hard not to watch this, read the news that it will probably be his last as a director, and look to the future.",
        "A flimsy bit of mildly romantic, putatively comic Anglophile bait.",
        "About Time, inadvertently, reveals itself to be About Men, and how they devise lies in order to create the illusion that all women supposedly want to see."

Since then I have bought it and show it to everyone I can. So far they all love it to (and say \"why have I not heard of this movie?\") The low ratings by critics are very disappointing. All I can imagine is that they must be judging that it doesn't fit perfectly into the film structure they were taught in film school, and even more importantly, they distrust movies that make them feel. The film is a bit like \"Groundhog Day\" in a number of ways, but \"About Time\" much more deeply involved in relationships where \"Groundhog Day\" is completely centered around one character who only manages a relationship at the end.",

It's true, everyone would wish to have Tim's gift, and the flaws in the time travel rules explained throughout the film didn't actually bother me at all. It's not a film about time travel at all, it's just a romantic comedy where a man has the chance to do things over and over till they're the way he wants them.\r Stupefied by the fact that Rachel McAdams would take on a role in \"Time Traveller's Wife\" and then in \"About Time\", but whatever works for her. Bill Nighy is spectacular as always. Gleeson is not much but he's supposed to be the average man so that kind of fits.\r Rom-com with no dentist required, it's okay. And Uncle Desmond's character is brilliant.",

The film is exquisitely scripted, backed by tremendous performances by the actors, especially by Bill Nighy, and most of all, the film gives us a dose of deep, meaningful emotional roller coaster.\rAt the beginning, we find that the central character\u2019s family has a deep secret: the men of that family are able to travel back in time. This makes one skeptical of the entire movie: haven\u2019t we already had a story like this before? From this point on, it seems as though the plot and the dialogue of the rest of the film are like a subtle closing argument as to why that time travel aspect is not really an important aspect of the film, although it does affect the story.\rAnother misconception of this film is that while it seems like a story of a man and a woman falling in love, it really is about the relationship between a father and a son. Their storyline pretty much outclasses and overshadows every other storyline of the film. From that prior skepticism when we first hear about the time travelling ability, as the story unfolds and the plot thickens, the audience becomes emotionally manhandled. Why? Because of love.\rWe see the chase for love, the choices that are made for and because of love, the consequences of love, and finally, the hardest part for us humans when we deal with love: knowing when to let go and have the courage to move on after losing love. That skepticism that I mentioned about at the beginning of the film? It dramatically changes into support, with the audience longing for the son to use his abilities more and more. You can sense, hear and feel the emotional wreckage going on in the theater, not because of the romance between a husband and wife, but because, for most of us, we don\u2019t have that loving relationship depicted here between father and son.\rThis movie couldn\u2019t have come to Korea at a better time. With Christmas almost here, it\u2019s almost as though this film has come to remind us that with the time we have, maybe we need to focus on what is really important to us. Even in a materialistic society like Korea, maybe this movie can remind us and help us move in the right direction little by little.",

The love story in this movie did not have any conflict at all. It seemed like it\u2019s too much of a perfect romantic story, which felt unrealistic.\r And the plot holes in this story is very noticeable. To get my point, I had to list down the time traveling rules, applied in the movie.\r 1-)Only male members of the family can travel in time.: This rule was broken when Tim traveled way back in time from the beginning of the movie with his sister, Kit Kat. The question why Kit Kat was allowed to time travel as long as she is with her brother is not answered.\r2-)Only travel to the past is possible: This rule was broken when Tim arrives in the past and then goes back to the present time. The question why Tim cannot go to the future, but can go back to the present is not answered.\r3-)It is impossible to go back in time before you were born: The first rule that wasn\u2019t broken.\r4-)Traveling back to a time before your child is born will cause a different child to be born and the original child will be lost: And the last rule that wasn\u2019t broken either.\r With these plot holes and the story lacking conflict makes the movie a bit boring to watch.\r The humor, however, saved the movie. It was funny and smartly written.\r While this time traveling romantic-comedy movie is not memorable, its humor, charm and beautiful setting will remain you to watch the movie until the credits roll.",

Much like the narrative of the film, Tim travels to the past and back to the present to perfect all the imperfections of his life, yet the filmAbout Time is a charming, utterly tender tale of life, love and the extraordinary of the ordinary. Much like the narrative of the film, Tim travels to the past and back to the present to perfect all the imperfections of his life, yet the film is anything but perfect, and that\u2019s ok. Suffering from inconsistent plot-points to breaking the rules that the film outlines, About Time is surely not a tightly-constricted narrative leap for the genre by any means. Regardless, the film casts an enchanting spell that not only lifts one\u2019s spirit, but causes you to merely forget about the rules Curtis makes, and breaks.\r Writer/director Richard Curtis has had quite a bit of luck in the romantic-comedy genre, making major waves penning Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary, Love Actually, Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral. Although he has stated that About Time will be his final directorial venture, only behind the aforementioned Love Actually and Pirate Radio, Curtis has succeeded well beyond many of the directors and screenwriters who hoped to successfully recreate anything Nicholas Sparks\u2018 has made, with the exception of The Notebook, of course. Fresh, spontaneous and demanding emotions, Curtis has brought new light to the British romantic-comedy front and has made the kind of films one isn\u2019t ashamed to laugh and cry at.\r Once Tim finally meets Mary (Rachael McAdams), Tim knows he has found the reason to adequately use his time-traveling powers. At first glance, Gleeson and McAdams seem like a poor physical match for a film that at times could be distracting or awkward. Instead, much to the extent and reality in life, the two feed off one another\u2019s unique characteristics splendidly. Tall, pale and with a hint of orange hair, Gleeson\u2018s unqiue on-screen charm is brashly alluring. McAdams on the other hand, stripped of all glam and instead substituted with a rather rag/tag girl-next door look, reminds us why she is cast in these roles and how easy it is to fall in love with her  quirks and all.\r McAdams, who is no stranger to the time-traveling love story narrative, venturing in her third quest as the desired love interest, first inThe Time Traveler\u2019s Wife and two years later in Woody Allen\u2019s acclaimed Midnight In Paris, enchants and reminds us just how adorable and likable she really is in these roles. Bringing a believable essence to the role of Mary, McAdams just may cement herself in time as the go-to, romantic-comedy poster girl.\r As a love story, About Time succeeds. As a tale of morality, a lesson on making each day your last and as a film about the bond between father and son, the film triumphs. Gleeson and Nighy share some of the most sentimental and heart-wrenching moments of the film that are sure to get your eyeballs sweating with joy. Incandescent as father and son, the two actors shine as the heart and soul of the film.\r As the pendulum swings closer to the end of the year, About Time will surely be atop my list of guilty cinematic pleasures of 2013, especially since I am such a sucker for hopeless romantic love stories with an underlining patriarchal theme. About Time may be a highly decorated cautionary tale of the beautiful moments in everyone\u2019s seemingly mundane life and the short time we have to live it, but the film, whether romantically tied or generationally suggestive, is a movie about appreciating the little things. \u201cSome days you want to re-live forever. Some days you want to live once\u201d, and Richard Curtis and company really hammer that notion home with their newest film. Essentially, About Time is really all ABOUT LOVE, and we are alright with that.",

I enjoyed the Time Traveler's Wife, and this was like that except lacking everything that made that movie interesting, with hardly any significant, interesting time travel and a boring, pathetic loser for a main character who never grows at all throughout the movie.\r The film doesn't make you care at all about ANY of the characters, in fact, because it never really tries to. The only \"tear jerking\" that happens is because of the sappy music and the marriage and baby stuff that some women love to fawn over despite the lack of connection to any of the characters in the film.\r It drags on especially toward the end for no real apparent reason other than to add to the sap appeal for the characters that we have no connection whatsoever to because, again, none was ever developed.\r The reviews promised a chick flick that men could actually enjoy.

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nAbout Time takes place in the cosy romantic Britain of Richard Curtis, where nervous middle class Englishmen fall head over heels for gorgeous American women. Curtis paints an idealised London of lawyers, playwrights, art galleries and vintage fashion. In the midst of it all is aspiring young lawyer Tim (Domhnall Gleeson), who arrives in the capital with new ambition, and a new ability.\r For Tim has just been told the family secret by his father (Bill Nighy). He, along with all the other men in his family, is a time traveller, and can rewrite his own history by travelling back to any point along his own timeline (but no killing Hitler). Nighy\u2019s matter-of-fact exposition on this matter starts the film; along with Tim\u2019s natural incredulity, it is a comic highlight.\r But this is a Richard Curtis project, and Tim\u2019s future is not a chronicle of epic destiny, but a chance for him to finally meet the girl of his dreams. She arrives swiftly in the form of the expatriated Mary (Rachel McAdams).\r Gleeson shines as an atypical leading man, red haired, slightly gangly; at once identifiable and appealing to the audience. McAdams is pleasant, but her character is given little to do. Notably, she never discovers Tim\u2019s big secret.\r Much of the humour comes from Tim\u2019s courtship of Mary, during which he repeats awkward encounters and must meet her for the first time more than once (including a memorable date in London\u2019s famously pitch-black Dans le Noir restaurant, a nifty cinematic experiment).\r The approach is reminiscent of that other great time travelling romantic comedy, the thoroughly brilliant Groundhog Day (1993). But Tim has a blessing, not a curse, and with complete control over his path, approaches with less cynicism and more \u201cLet\u2019s try that again, shall we?\u201d\r So the blend of time travel with a romantic comedy is not entirely original. There is also an inevitable comparison with The Time Traveller\u2019s Wife (2009), which also starred Rachel McAdams. Maybe she\u2019s stuck in a time loop herself.\r As for specifics, the film directly asks you not to question it too much. \u201cWe don\u2019t seem to have destroyed civilisation yet\u201d says Nighy. Some rules rear their head as the narrative progresses, but it\u2019s hard to know what the boundaries actually are, and I just watched Primer (2004).\r This is not a film about time travel, but a romantic comedy in which time travel furthers the plot. But it is about time: how we choose to spend it, and who we choose to spend it with. And while it\u2019s a romance on the face of things, the more interesting relationship, and certainly the more poignant, is between Tim and his father.\r At times, it\u2019s unashamedly sentimental. The entire film has a softness to it that makes you wonder if Curtis smeared Vaseline on the lens. Curtis even manages to turn a potentially day ruining downpour into a fresh and glorious celebration.\r The strength of the writing is in the ability to remain unexpected, and some of this is naturally due to the ability of time travel to allow unexpected things to happen. Conflict appears in unlikely places, and least of all in the relationship between Gleeson and McAdams.\r It\u2019s not perfect, but for all the derivative and saccharine elements, the central father-son relationship is eloquent, and something rarely explored in this way, especially with this level of British reserve. Though the script is witty, it is only peppered with outright comedy (this is still gold, from the versatile Tom Hollander, fantastic as a jaded slovenly playwright, to Tim\u2019s swift cycle through a series of potential best men, complete with appropriate speeches).\r Being relatively unfamiliar with his previous works (aside from classic television shows Blackadder and The Vicar of Dibley) About Time has at the very least inspired me to investigate Richard Curtis\u2019s other films, which are apparently much stronger.",

And then along comes pure entertainment, wrapped in a neat little packaged called ABOUT TIME.  If I don't nod off during the first quarter of the film - if I am totally engaged - laughing out loud all by myself -- weeping a few tears of joy at perfect moments in the film -- then I will be happy and feel that it was money well spent.  I rarely urge others to see a film because we all have different tastes.  My taste is:  if I am entertained, made to feel good, and if I watch the credits rise up on the screen with a feeling of having been totally whisked away to a better world -- then I am happy.  Forget American Hustle,  forget Django Unchained;  come away with a good taste in your mouth for once and watch ABOUT TIME.  Well done!",

A main character who is a boy lives in a small town has a terrific magic. The magic is a skill of time traveling. After his father told him they have a skill of it, the boy always travels time whenever he wants. The boy wants to meet a true love. Then one day, he met an attractive girl at a bar. They fall in each other in first sight. They loved truly and got married. The whole story is about like this. I feel really cozy while watching the movie. The movie gave me a kind of tip to find a good partner. Before I watch the movie, I thought the only thing important of my lifetime companion is apperance.
