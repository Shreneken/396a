  "summary": "A young boy stands on a station platform. The train is about to leave. Should he go with his mother or stay with his father? An infinity of possibilities rise from this decision. As long as he doesn't choose, anything is possible. Every life deserves to be lived. [Magnolia Pictures]",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Van Dormael has crafted a saga that, even at two-plus hours, is endlessly, enormously watchable.",
    "van Dormael’s vivid visual sense and genuine curiosity about the nature of love and life, time and death, make it well worth surrendering to his imagination for a while.",
    "Van Dormael's intriguing script is more than matched in his flamboyant direction of this 2-hour-plus tale, heroically edited by Matyas Veress and Susan Shipton into a fluid, generally understandable narrative.",
    "As philosophy, Mr. Nobody seems sillier than it is profound. But in a parallel reality, more movies would have this degree of insane ambition.",
    "Writer-director Jaco Van Dormael (“Toto the Hero”) spins flashbacks and time-lapse photography, stunning montages, whirling, circling cameras and stunning underwater, deep space and Martian landscape photography into a film that is as intentionally opaque as it is overlong.",
    "In the end, Mr. Nobody’s title is simply too apt.",
    "Though a lot of it is well written and directed and, quite often, funny or poignant, the individual scenes rarely become part of a larger whole.",
    "An ambitious, if uneven, experimental sci-fi romance that is less a thought-provoker than a dazzling juggling act.",
    "The only truly graspable notion the film can be said to put forth is one of increasingly tedious sci-fi-romantic genre busy-ness.",
    "Mr. Nobody is simply a failure."

Throughout, I could feel my brain exploding as I tried to grasp what was going on. However, once I had an idea (and that idea was later confirmed), everything made a little more sense, but even then, the ending is still completely open to interepretation. In many ways, that is what makes this film so successful. It is confusing as all get out, then it shows a little \"hint\" and then as that sinks in, you realize that that may not be the answer we were looking for. Ultimately, it is a film of decisions and how those decisions will change the course that our lives take. From a technical standpoint, the cinematography is great and Jaco Van Dormael is able to really create some interesting things with this film without question and really helps you to feel sympathy and happiness and then symapthy and then happiness over-and-over throughout the film.. On top of that, Jared Leto is great as always in the lead role.\r In terms of negatives, the confusion is one of them. I love the confusion, but at times, it goes too far and you are left sitting there thinking \"really?\". On top of that, there are a few inconsistencies I noticed that disrupted the film slightly for me or left me more confused about the inclusion of a specific scene if it was not going to have an impact on other things. Other than that, I really enjoyed this film and it certainly makes you use your head.",

His story concerns multiple lives based on the choices he makes throughout his life. It's an interesting concept, and it works extremely well; its beautifully filmed, has impressive performances (particularly from Jared Leto, who plays Nemo aged 35 and 118) and a delicate score by the director's late brother, the story whilst complex is both fascinating and thought-provoking.

Nobody would not be a good pick, unless you have introverted friends or something, for watching socially- you need to watch it closely not be chatting, to catch how it all fits together, the little visual details, the slight changes from scene to scene etc. You also won't enjoy Nobody if you're using some sort of \"action\" oriented mood modifier like alcohol or cocaine. I first watched this on psychedelics and it fits that state of mind *perfectly*, however!\r No movie is perfect for every state of mind, natural or extranaturall, so Nobody gets a 10/10 from me due to the fact that, for me, it is perfect for a state of mind. Other movies might be enjoyable, or even excellent for their respective moods, but it's very rare that I find something that at any point I can think it \"perfect\". I was thinking about it for weeks and had some related dreams! Just watched it sober and it still stands up.\r You'll be most likely to agree with my opinion if you're someone that really likes to think about life and the big questions who likes to look at things from many angles. Nobody is a great meditation on meaning, love, and our collective existential ignorance. This is the first time I've taken the time to write a review of a movie anywhere on the net, so that says something as I've watched a lot of movies in a lot of different states of mind. Had to \"correct\" the critics with, to be nice, very \"different\" taste.",

This ambitious attempt at answering many of the big questions about the meaning of life, love and what matters does a tremendous job of exploring these topics and in a way that's entertaining, enlightening and informative. Fans of the metaphysical, like yours truly, are sure to feel sufficiently nourished after watching this one, as it provides a cogent, accessible treatise on these subjects, effectively incorporating them into a thoroughly captivating narrative. Admittedly there are a few stretches where the pacing lags a bit, but that's more than made up for by the film's inventive visuals, brilliant production design, excellent soundtrack, clever editing, and fine performances by Jared Leto, Diane Kruger and Sarah Polley. Think of this one as a fusion of \"What the Bleep Do We Know,\" \"Cloud Atlas,\" \"What Dreams May Come,\" \"The World According to Garp\" and additional offerings, and you've got an idea what this one is like. However, if you're unwilling to open your mind to some cutting-edge thinking presented here, then skip this one, as it's not likely to be to your liking. But, if you enjoy the unconventional and thought-provoking, this one will be right up your alley. If nothing else, this legacy release is definitely a refreshing change from all of this year's mediocre awards season offerings that are being erroneously passed off as \"masterpieces.\"",

It makes it pretty obvious the movie is about possibilities in life from the start, but for some reason it just twists your mind along the way. This is a pretty decent negative, hence the 9 points instead of 10. I mean, I'm pretty good at following plots, but even I was getting a little twisted here and there. However, I don't really feel this is a huge plot blunder. It is hard to pull something like this off and not get some confusion, but it could've been arranged a bit better. Regardless, Mr. Nobody will having you crying, smiling, and most importantly, thinking. I just love movies that make you think, and while the concept of the many different possible roads in life may not be revolutionary for philosophy, some visual aid and drama to put things in perspective is appreciated. Overall, loved this movie, highly recommended if you can appreciate, and follow, a complex plot with philosophical meaning.",

Beats heavy weights from 2000s like the Dark Knight by a mile.\r Note that the home media version is the EXTENDED director's cut, which in my opinion was necessary, because the theatrical version felt a little bit as a sci-fi thriller.

It is a post-modernist sci-fi/fantasy epic that traverses philosophies, genres, timelines, and states of consciousness with reckless abandon and frenetic energy. But it's not a nonsensical film, and the element of control it may have lacked in sloppier hands is there in full force. \"Mr. Nobody\" is in perfect control of the exclusive medium it has designed for itself. It knows exactly where it's going at every stage of its unique journey and this confidence in itself to pull off its complex and lofty is part of what makes it work so well. Of course what else makes it work is its mastery in every aspect of production and execution - the phenomenal lead performance of Jared Leto,  rich visual imagination, and rhapsodic score. \"Mr. Nobody\" is a viewing experience I've never had before and surely will never have again from another film. I've never felt gratitude towards a filmmaker for making a film as I did towards Jaco Van Dormael for making this.",

This entire film hinges on an existential concept, that of choice and that in the moment before we make a choice, everything is possible.Nemo as a child is presented with an impossible choice, and because he is unable to choose, everything is possible. This is where the movie spins out into the tangential and convoluted, dipping into quantum theory and various structuralist and deconstructionist philosophies. If you're looking for an action-orientated sci-fi flick, look elsewhere. This film is higher grade, requiring constant concentration - for about three hours! - and probably a second or third viewing to catch all the subtleties and nuances present not only in the obvious story, but happening in the background thanks to some truly fantastic cinematography.Jared Leto is incredible in this film. He plays not one, but 12 iterations of adult Nemo, following the various trajectories his life could've taken given choices he could've made all stemming from the one he cannot make as a child. Of course, these various life trajectories becoming increasingly complicated and interwoven, becoming entangled with each other as Nemo's choices continue to change and distort reality.This movie is at times contemporary romance, YA love story, sci-fi action (which some amazing scenes on Mars!), sci-fi thriller, high drama and family saga. All these threads weave together to create an epic tapestry that is difficult to digest all at once. I strongly suggest multiple viewings of this film, and it's so beautiful and with a stunning soundtrack, and so sincerely acted by Jared Leto who transforms physically and psychologically between the roles so effortlessly that I don't think setting aside three hours for this film more than once is such a tall order.Mr Nobody is quite easily my favorite film of all time and I strongly recommend it to those who enjoy sophisticated science fiction that delves beyond the superficial aesthetic of a shiny future.",

That’s why it’s so hard to choose.Mr. Nobody is definitely one of my favorite movies. I had the opportunity to see it again 10 years after his release (in a wonderful director's cut version) and I am convinced that he is aging very well. Initially it was not taken into consideration in my country (Italy); then in 2016 the Italian distributors perceived the enormous success they had decided to take it to Italy. My advice is to watch it in the original language (you can find it on Netflix); dubbing,in my humble opinion, is done in a hurry and doesn't fully make the beauty that the film carries with it. Why did I like this movie so much? First of all, Jared Leto's performance is incredible, he really manages to extricate himself in a myriad of different roles with great skill. The soundtrack and the non-original songs that accompanied the film are perfect (including Where is my Mind by Pixies, great!). The film is complex, opens up a tons of readings and generates many questions, to watch and to review and to comment on. And finally, from a technical point of view, thanks to a very creative montage that creates a nice rhythm and a sensational photography is a pleasure for the eyes. In short, for me it is highly recommended.",

He doesn’t have the charisma to pull you through this kind of story.  If we compare this to films in a similar vein, The Fountain,  Run Lola Run, or butterfly effect; its apparent how inferior it is.    As Leto progresses the movie, his stoicis and aloofness just turns you off  to giving a **** about what’s happening to him.    Have you seen a less convincing father?    Compared to the frenetic, emotional performance of Lola, her desperation sucks you through the movie.  Its important to for the protagonist to draw the audience in to maintain tension and drama.\r While this movie tries to pass itself off as something it’s not; interjecting itself with bill nye presentations throughout; it ironically is less logical and thought provoking than the “B” movie butterfly effect.   Just one expample is the characters name Nemo Nobody, which the movie continuously hits your over the head with.  They could’ve explained one time that Nemo means nobody.  There’s  reason why in 20,000 leagues, the name Nemo is used instead of “Nobody”.  Nobody as a name is hokey and totally unconvincing.",

I could sit here for hours and talk about the many ideas that might stem from this film, but I don't want to because the film's chronology was purposefully muddled in a lazy attempt at sending a message. It wants you to sit there for 2 hours trying to make sense of what might be going on. Had it spent more time at the end lending its own cohesive meaning, it might have been brilliant . . . it didn't do that. It purposefully leaves you with a glimpse of its purpose and then - literally - laughs at you at the end of the movie. He was laughing at you, ladies and gentleman, like it or not. It was a horrible attempt at provoking thought and finishes up by laughing at you for having sat through it for two hours. If you want to continue justifying the 2 hours you just lost by contemplating its \"deep meaning,\" then maybe you'll like it. But I'm not one to justify bad decisions I've made in my life.

I haven't seen too many art-house films, but I was pleasantly surprised by the tone which wasn't too serious, or pretentious. There were laugh out loud moments during a movie with themes concerning choice, destiny, and metaphysics.I was enamoured by the love story, it was feel good without being Hollywood.The visuals were amazing. I believe that Jaco explained that he used different DP's to film the different possible lives of Mr. Nobody. There were scenes set in the year 2092 that were absolutely stunning on the big screen.I found the soundtrack to be awesome. Any movie with \"Mr. Sandman\" and \"Where is my mind?\" is alright by me.The movie was extremely imaginative, original, funny, and will probably have me thinking about it and my own life for days after viewing.",
