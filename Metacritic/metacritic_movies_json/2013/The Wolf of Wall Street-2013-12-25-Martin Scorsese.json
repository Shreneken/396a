    "critic_reviews": [
        "This telling of the tale possesses enormous cinematic energy and a killer supporting cast full of hilarious delights.",
        "What keeps the energy percolating is DiCaprio\u2019s performance, in the loosest and most charismatic turn of his career.",
        "It is the best and most enjoyable American film to be released this year.",
        "If it had been a drama, The Wolf of Wall Street might have been unwatchable: There\u2019s simply too much of everything. But Scorsese and screenwriter Terence Winter (The Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire) hit on the genius idea to turn the story into a riotous comedy, one that keeps topping itself everytime you think it can\u2019t possibly get crazier.",
        "The Wolf of Wall Street joins \"After Hours\" as the most openly comedic films Scorsese has made.",
        "A very fast three hours, Wolf is a fascinating, revolting, outlandish, uproarious, exhilarating and exhausting master work on immorality.",
        "DiCaprio's swaggering, swinging-dick performance is the wildest damn thing he's ever put onscreen.",
        "The oddest thing of all about The Wolf Of Wall Street is also the most unusual for a Scorsese film: it is incredibly, incredibly funny.",
        "Sensational entertainment. This $100 million extravaganza is \u2014 let\u2019s face it \u2014 rampantly over the top. Hell, it\u2019s by Martin Scorsese, who is always over the top.",
        "As hot and wet as freshly butchered meat: every second, every frame of its three-hour running time is virile with a lifetime\u2019s accumulated genius.",
        "A touch too long, yet never slack, at three hours, TWOWS benefits from independent funding, Scorsese\u2019s brass balls and an A-grade cast\u2019s turbulent improvisations to emerge as an epic, boldly broad screwball comedy about the state of America, then and now.",
        "There\u2019s a cracked logic, a genius almost, to the film\u2019s amped-up irreverence. Maybe laughter isn\u2019t just the best medicine, but the only sensible response to this much brazen amorality.",
        "At a full three hours, the movie flirts with wearing out its welcome about two-thirds through, but recovers to end up an exhausting, operatic black comedy that leaves you wanting more.",
        "Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Wolf of Wall Street is absurd, ridiculous, over the top, overindulgent, overlong, overstuffed, over-everythinged. And that is precisely the point.",
        "Since Belfort and his crew are complete knuckleheads, every bit the low-class slobs who bray like animals on the trading floor, The Wolf Of Wall Street may be the funniest film of 2013, rife with gross misbehavior, pranks, and tomfoolery.",
        "One of the funniest yet most depressing movies in Martin Scorsese\u2019s long career \u2014 a celebration and evisceration of male savagery, financial division. It\u2019s like \u201cGoodFellas,\u201d only (slightly) more legal, which is very much the point.",
        "The most exhilarating film of the year is also the most exhausting.",
        "Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street is abashed and shameless, exciting and exhausting, disgusting and illuminating; it's one of the most entertaining films ever made about loathsome men.",
        "Scorsese tells the Wolf\u2019s story almost strictly from the Wolf\u2019s point of view. We never see his victims. It\u2019s actually an effective technique, because the Wolf certainly never really saw his victims either \u2014 not as actual human beings who could be hurt by his financial hocus-pocus.",
        "It's rambunctious and unruly, but mesmerizing.",
        "The feverishly paced film is hell-bent on making the audience feel like they just snorted a Belushian mountain of blow. You can practically feel your teeth grinding to dust. As with any high, though, it also doesn't know when to stop.",
        "As an sensory experience, 'WOWS' is mostly a terrifically visceral one, a full throttle fast and furious bacchanalia of drug-fueled madness. But as a scathing indictment of American rapacity, it isn't particularly deep or resonant beyond the exterior.",
        "This movie may tire you out with its hammering, swaggering excess, but it is never less than wide-awake.",
        "A delirious, manic, push-the-limits comedy of gaudy amorality that tests the audience\u2019s taste. But it\u2019s a gamble that works, since you leave this adrenaline trip wasted, but invigorated.",
        "Scorsese, that sly spiritualist, is out to make us sick on commerce and greed run rampant. He moves us beyond the allure of avarice so that we might take better stock of ourselves. What starts as a piggish paean becomes, by the end, an invigorating purge.",
        "Scorsese never digs too deeply under the skin of these reprehensible playboy douchebags, and there are times where the swooping photography, smash-and-grab editing and toe-tapping soundtrack conspire to almost \u2013 almost \u2013 make us like them. But when the film\u2019s cylinders are firing, it\u2019s impossible not to be dragged along.",
        "The Wolf of Wall Street, for all its abundant appeal, is no Greek tragedy. It lacks the wildness of Taxi Driver, the jeopardy of GoodFellas and the anguish of Raging Bull. Far better to view this as a stylistic homage, a remastered greatest hits compilation, an amiable bit of self-infringement.",
        "Nearly as extravagant as the characters it depicts, Martin Scorsese's comic, operatically-scaled film is, on a moment-by-moment basis, often madly entertaining due to its live-wire energy, exuberant performances and the irresistible appeal of watching naughty boys doing very naughty things.",
        "A big, unruly bacchanal of a movie that huffs and puffs and nearly blows its own house down, but holds together by sheer virtue of its furious filmmaking energy and a Leonardo DiCaprio star turn so electric it could wake the dead.",
        "Seemingly taking its cue from Belfort\u2019s shenanigans, the film is completely without modulation. It starts with all the knobs cranked up to 11 and remains that way for the next three hours. While what\u2019s onscreen is never uninteresting, its unrelentingness is exhausting.",
        "For all of its carnal frivolity, The Wolf of Wall Street lacks passion and purpose, qualities Scorsese at his best has in abundance.",
        "Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s most charismatic performance ever anchors Martin Scorsese\u2019s robust and raunchy lowlifes-of-high-finance comedy The Wolf of Wall Street.",
        "There's no question about the efficacy of Scorsese's filmmaking prowess, only that he never knows -- or doesn't care -- to slow down and deepen the material.",
        "Been there, done that. As thrilling a filmmaker as Martin Scorsese continues to be, and as wild a performance as Leonardo DiCaprio dishes up as its morally bankrupt master of the universe, The Wolf of Wall Street seems almost entirely unnecessary.",
        "The Wolf of Wall Street remains one-note even at is most outr\u00e9, an episodic portrait of rapaciousness in which decadence escalates into debauchery escalates into depravity \u2014 but, miraculously, not death.",
        "With all of its excess, Wolf of Wall Street might not rank up there with Scorsese's best, it sure has fun trying.",
        "By buying the pitch that its central character\u2019s escapades were the stuff of mesmerizing drama or comedy, Scorsese, Winter and DiCaprio reveal themselves as dupes \u2014 the latest in a long line of clever folks swindled by Jordan Belfort.",
        "Any meaningful perspective on the greedfest of the period is obscured by the gleefulness of the depiction.",
        "The film is almost three hours long and precious little of it feels new \u2013 not from Scorsese or from anybody else.",
        "The movie's benumbed by its own parade of bad behavior. Like some of Scorsese's other second-tier works \u2014 \"Casino,\" \"Bringing Out the Dead\" \u2014 the gulf between virtuoso technical facility and impoverished material cannot be bridged. It's diverting, sort of, to see DiCaprio doing lines off a stripper's posterior, but after the 90th time it's like, enough already with heinous capitalistic extremes.",
        "The Wolf of Wall Street is a fake. It\u2019s meant to be an expos\u00e9 of disgusting, immoral, corrupt, obscene behavior, but it\u2019s made in such an exultant style that it becomes an example of disgusting, obscene filmmaking. It\u2019s actually a little monotonous; spectacular, and energetic beyond belief, but monotonous in the way that all burlesques become monotonous after a while.",
        "Martin Scorsese's keyed-up, irreverent tone frequently fails to distinguish itself from the grunting arias sung by the oily paragons of commerce his film evidently intended to deflate.",
        "Epic in size but claustrophobically narrow in scope, The Wolf of Wall Street maintains a near-exclusive focus on the greed and self-indulgence of its proudly rapacious hero.",
        "A veritable orgy of immorality, each scene making the same point only more and more outrageously, the action edited with Scorsese's usual manic exuberance but to oh-so-monotonous effect.",
        "There are hints of greatness, one or two artfully constructed scenes that remind you why you look forward to new Scorsese films in the first place. But as a highly detailed portrait of true-life corruption and bad behavior in the financial sector, Wolf is pushy and hollow, too much of a bad thing.",
        "If you\u2019re going to invest three hours watching a movie about a convicted stock swindler, it needs to be a whole lot more compelling than Martin Scorsese\u2019s handsome, sporadically amusing and admittedly never boring \u2014 but also bloated, redundant, vulgar, shapeless and pointless \u2014 Wolf of Wall Street.",
        "Here\u2019s something I never expected to say, something I doubt I\u2019d have believed if someone else had said it to me: Martin Scorsese can make a three-hour movie without one fresh perspective or compelling character from end to end. The proof, for three agonizing hours, can be found in The Wolf of Wall Street."

The Wolf of Wall Street is well written, well shot, and clearly well directed overall. The acting is fantastic, especially from Leo  He put in one of the best performances I seen in a long time.  I have never been so universally approving of how a film was put together yet had such a negative reaction to it.\rI'm a white male and I don't identify as a feminist, but if this film is indicative of the new norm, I may have to start doing so.  The misogyny in this film is so unforgiving and goes so unaddressed that it simply cannot just be satire or a cultural mirror.  I'm not talking about the hookers either.  Repeatedly, women in this film are shown to be unbelievably weak.  Sex is their only commodity, beauty is the only thing that matters.  When Jack's first wife, with whom he has multiple children, finds him cheating with Naomi, all she can do is cry.  We never see her again. She never even mentions their kids!  Naomi is worse.  Even though she is never presented as anything more than a vapid beauty, she is worshiped.  During her most \"powerful\" scene, the only one where she exerts any kind of force over Jack, she is calling him daddy and giving him blue balls.  During the movie, she is completely powerless to address any of Jack's problems with drugs or cheating.  We never even see her try.  The female lead of the movie is a beautiful accessory and nothing else.  All she has to offer him is sex, and she knows it.  Even the woman who is ostensibly the most female stockbroker at Jack's firm is weak  Jack even gives a teary eyed speech about how she never could have made it if he didn't lend her $25,000 when he gave her the job.\rIf the intention of this movie was to wake up people like me, who have probably been watching films like this without batting an eye for years, then Scorcese has succeeded.  Many viewers, however, will probably be too taken in by the flashy editing, language, and fantasy to give it a second thought.\rIt\u2019s a shame that something this destructive has to come in such a well executed package.",

It's hard to understand why DiCaprio and Scorsese invested so much of themselves in this movie as director, actor and producers of this appalling production.  One can assume they teamed up once again because they will most certainly make money hand over fist because this surreal, tasteless, vulgar and immature material does and will continue to appeal to the masses. It's disturbing to realize this production reflects how much cash (and other vices such as drugs, alcohol, sex and vulgarity) are controlling forces in the world.  Of course, it's nothing new, but it would be nice to know there are people who value maturity!  Most of us willing to a good laugh and we aren't repressed.  I do question why there's such a compulsion to rely on the lowest common denominator to sell movie tickets.\r While I do believe reviewers should fill their reviews of the Wolf of Wall Street with spoilers, I firmly believe  readers and movie-goers should be able to read a review without learning every detail about a movie or book.  However, I must defend those with physical disabilities as a whole and specifically those with Cerebral Palsy.  The Wolf of Wall Street includes scene(s) in which DiCaprio and his sidekick, Jonah Hill  take copious amounts of old Quaaludes and when they finally start to take affect, the effects are described by DiCaprio as a new level or experience in taking Quaaludes likened to having Cerebral Palsy.  As someone who is profoundly affected since birth with Cerebral Palsy, you can be assured such a depiction was not only\rtasteless, wrong but also offensive.  As someone  born with Cerebral Palsy, I am more than willing to laugh at myself as well. There are times if you don't laugh you'll cry.  This was hurtful because in fact, those with Cerebral Palsy are often intelligent, compassionate and productive members of society.   I loved my career as a social worker and I cherish being a wife, mother and a grandmother. Those involved with this movie should be ashamed of themselves.  I did not leave the movie theater feeling good.  I left feeling angry, dirty, demeaned and heartbroken.  Normally, I would leave such a vile movie but it seemed so surreal, I kept waiting to see if there was a big payoff at the end.  Instead, the movie proved to me it is nothing more than a failure--an enormous flop!!\r I am especially angered because The Wolf of Wall Street had such potential to be an exceptional movie and it's has been poorly promoted.   It occurs to me those involved with the movie  might indeed be ashamed and elected to do little promotion and instead relied on DiCaprio's and Scorsese's name recognition in Hollywood.  In researching the movie, I and many others wrongly assumed the movie was something akin to the movies, Wall Street, Catch Me If You Can with perhaps a  dash of  Goodfellas.  Instead, it was more like, a disgusting remake of Animal House, if that's possible and a disappointing, cartoonish versions of Wall Street and Goodfellas.  If I had the opportunity to counsel Mr. Scorsese and Mr. DiCaprio, I would strongly advise them to seek higher caliber projects where they don't work together anytime soon.\r In studying the media about Wolf at Wall Street, it's obvious one of the biggest concerns was merely to learn of an appropriate release date so the movie and the actors would be eligible to compete during the upcoming awards season.  I know Leonardo DiCaprio will be deserving of many future Oscars and SAG awards.  I also know years from now, Wolf of Wall Street will be a cult favorite but this year Wolf of Wall Street should only win the Razzy.",

Some people will inevitably be so put off by the harsh composition of the message that they fail to heed the importance of that message; but in presenting so much of the bad and the ugly behind Wall Street so unflinchingly, Scorsese has crafted an insightful  and important  deconstruction of post-millennial America\u2019s moral erosion.

So I wasn't surprised with theI confess I had some curiosity and some expectations when I went to see this movie. Scorcese and Di Caprio are two of the biggest names in the current film scene, and both have provided us with some nice films. So I wasn't surprised with the fuss around the movie but, when I saw it, I was very disappointed.The film is based on an autobiographical book written by Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker who quickly enriched, through financial maneuvers of high risk and zero legality. The book describes not only the business but the life of luxury, drugs and sex that he took, and the way he eventually paid for it. The film, as far as we understand, is quite faithful to the book's account, and the book also makes an apparently true story. The film resembles \"Goodfellas\" in many ways, but with great differences in which the gangster movie gets the better of it. The main problem of this film lies in three essential points: The first point is the apparent glorification of the fraud and Belfort's dissolute lifestyle. The message passed by the film is \"crime pays\". It spends more than an hour telling us, in detail, the outrages of Belfort and his team of bastards without any need, shocking some public, who leave the cinema with the feeling that the film passes an ethically wrong message, and society does not need to receive it because it receives enough bad influences.The second essential point is the absence of a counterpoint to the scenes of excesses shown. Okay, Belfort is a swine, drug addict and corrupt who has gotten rich too fast and too easy. So? Where is the counterpoint to that? He committed crimes, but what are the effects of his crimes? Who lost out on Belfort's crimes? How can audiences truly realize the size of his mistakes? The public never gets these answers because the film gets too lost in the details of Belfort's scandals. The movie makes people think that Belfort never harmed anyone, and that he was just crazy, or smart.The third negative point is the construction of the characters. They are black-and-white, without the psychological complexity and refinement that we find in \"Goodfellas\", for example. There's no such thing here. The characters are summed up as junkies, sex offenders, eccentrics, some bored cops and little else. DiCaprio was well enough in his role, but being such an abject role, it's impossible to like and enjoy his performance.I think Scorcese thought this film as a comedy, but the truth is that it is not funny. The film is morally shocking, not funny. So, it was a bad idea. This film would have been excellent if it had been conceived as a drama and had behind it some moral balance. That was not the case. It is a mad journey through senseless immorality, without notion and without any pretext than easy laughter, and this is quite unpleasant.",

Like the Aunt Margret character who states at one point... yeah I lived through the 60's. I was feeling like Scorsese thought his audience wasn't sophisticated enough to understand the excess these guys thrived on. I think we got that in the first half hour. Too bad we don't get to see a little more dimension of this guy, but instead time is wasted on the same old repetitive behavior over and over again sex, drugs, sex, drugs, greed, greed, greed. This movie had so many great things going for it but just goes over the top to try to be funny but instead is just plain obnoxious. Too bad so many talents were wasted because of the lack of tightening up and cutting scenes  and developing other characters to counter the balance of the the over-all story. It was actually fun to sit through once but I don't think this will be one in my DVD collection.",

TheI am a gigantic Scorsese fan. I go back to Mean Streets. There is no problem with the direction and the acting is top notch, especially Jonah Hill who keeps getting better with each performance. It is a true adaptation of Belfort's novel. The pace can be electrifying at times, so good you forget the 3 hour running time. Cinematically, it has subtle moments of genius. So why a mediocre review? Personal prejudice with the subject matter. While watching this movie, you wait for redemption or at least true punishment. You expect Jake LaMotta to live a sad life, Henry Hill to crumble and Joe Pesci was doomed in both Goodfellas and Casino. They were satisfying endings because in the moral mind of the audience, they reaped what they had sown. I don't believe I am spoiling anything when I say Belfort has not really been given, what most of our recently recession minds would consider, a gigantic cross to bear. I believe the mixed reviews you are seeing have a lot to do with the time of release. Most people won't get past the \" These are the clowns that killed the economy\" feeling. The Wolf comes at you hard and doesn't let up. It is a spot-on take of the excess of boiler room bandits. Movie making wise, Scorsese remains a master and his muse DiCaprio brilliant. Another time and another place, maybe I would enjoy it. For me, it was too exhausting. It was excess on the excess. I know it was real to the core, I have met some of the characters. These are empty people. I guess I am just at that stage in life where I want to escape when I go to the movies. The Wolf is great film making, but it is also a horrendous story about horrendous people.",

It is not a case of one person seeing one thing and another seeing something different.\r The immoral (not amoral) life of Jordan Belfort requires this treatment  the movie is what he was: loud, brazenly immoral, repellent, completely over-the-top and a brilliant con man. A more \"restrained\" treatment could not have done it justice.\r Are you offended by what you see in this movie? Good! It is offensive, but that is the point. You need to see how offensive Belfort and his whole operation was/is. This bad, bad behavior is being held up for ridicule. Laughing at it is the only way viewing it could be tolerable. He does not deserve to be treated as a serious man.\r But there is a serious sub-text to this movie. It is an indictment of Wall Street as a whole. The film makes this clear, as Belfort spends one day in a \"legitimate\" Wall Street firm on 1987's Black Monday, and is exposed to the immoral operation of the \"best\" firms: the fact that all brokers are essentially conmen fleecing their clients. His genius is to take what he sees and break it free from its shackles of faux respectability, starting with his initial staffing  hiring buddies who are small time drug dealers. He is not debasing Wall Street, he is embodying it in its purest form.\r And the end of movie makes a very cogent point: how modern society treats the parasites of Wall Street. We see the FBI agent who could have been a broker, and rich, if he had chosen to be a Wall Street conman riding on the subway home. We see Belfort's punishment: 22 months in a country-club prison, and a fine of only part of his vast ill-gotten wealth, where a poor man guilty of 1% of his crimes would have spent 20 years of hard time. And we see the audience of Belfort's \"sales\" seminars looking hungrily at him, desperately wanting to be able to do what he did.\r Having seen the miscreants on Wall Street that crashed the economy at the cost of trillions of dollars to the nation in 1987, walk scott-free, not a single indictment much less a conviction, and not even miss one of their bonuses, this is a very timely movie.\r DiCaprio is a necessity in the lead role. It does not draw on his full capabilities, and he carries the role easily, but only a top-flight charismatic actor could portray Belfort and bring the audience along with his utterly self-centered, corrupt, destructive ride.\r This movie forms a trilogy with two of Scorsese's other films: Goodfellas (one of the best films ever made) and Casino. They all chronicle the rise and fall of the hustler.\r The only reason I give this a 9 instead of a 10, is that then I have no where to go with rating Marty's other great films, several of which (like Goodfellas) are among the best movies ever made.",

Regardless of how he is portrayed in film, he is real, and people like him are real. Those who find this film over the top are simply ignoring the true nature of society. Does 12 Years a Slave glorify slavery? Absolutely not. It is doing the opposite: Showing the true horrors of slavery. Did Schindler's List glorify Nazism? No. It shamed it.

I\u2019m no fan of Mr. DiCaprio who, no matter what adult role he plays, always reminds me of a little boy wearing his father\u2019s felt hat. However, in this film, Mr. DiCaprio overcomes my previewing prejudices and is quite believable in his role as Mr. Belfort but, unfortunately, that\u2019s where the kudos end. The film is 3 hours long but seems more like 6. Thelma Schoonmaker is being touted by the producers for \u201cBest Film Editing\u201d but her work product, at least to this viewer, is virtually unnoticed. The film is filled with gratuitous sex scenes that are more crude than craft and actually get in the way of the story and plot. Orgies may have their place in depicting a scene in a Roman harem but they simply detract from the film and like most of the unneeded scenes, add to the uncomfortable length of the picture. I give the film a 5 and recommend that, if you do go to see it, bring lunch and/or dinner, although the raunchy and tasteless scenes will probably destroy any appetite you might otherwise have had.",

How can you expect some boring, dull screenplay and actors to carry on and illustrate the real events that happened? This film is not just about 'corruption' by the way. Not entirely at least; it's mainly about greed. It does not 'glorify' Jordan Belfort; all this film does is portray to the audience how greed tore him and his associates apart, and it stayed true to the book. He starts out poor, and a fairy decent human being at the beginning, and all he wants to do is get ahead. Then once he gets what he wants, he starts to want more and more. This film is about the human condition. We always want more than we need and we will always try to bend the rules to get it.

Its typical Scorsese magic, as despite the long 3 hour running time the director manages to build the character of Jordan Belfort in-depth with careful meticulousness, from his normal man aspiring to complete the everyman's dream of hitting it big on Wall Street to the dissipation of his family and friends as he plummets down to earth with the weight of his lies and moral corruption pushing down on him hard.

Jonah Hill had a hilarious character that branched pretty far from his usual shtick. The color palettes on screen would pop but still looked blanched when in a working environment which made for a cool if subtle effect.

The music choices became a problem in the second half of the movie.

If you were alive and over 18 back then you already know thisWolf of Wall Street is one of my top 3 picks for most over-rated movie of the year (after Inside Llewyn Davis and Fruitvale Station). It\u2019s a portrayal of Wall Street in the 1980\u2019s. If you were alive and over 18 back then you already know this was a time of excess, immorality and corruption.  Scorsese presents all this in truly over-the-top fashion, while offering no insight or enlightenment about any of it.  At 3 hours, the movie is way, way too long.  It drags, in part, because several scenes are repeated over and over.  The movie also borrows heavily from previous Scorsese movies, especially Goodfellas, and you may find yourself saying, \u201cI\u2019ve seen this before.\u201d  What Wolf lacks in originality, Scorsese tries to make up for through excess.  Despite lots of beautiful naked women, Scorsese amps the level of cursing, drug use and orgies to the point where it actually becomes boring and monotonous.  Impossible, you say?  I wish!  Still want to see this move, but need an excuse?  Thinking of playing the \u201cmy girlfriend is a Leonardo DiCaprio fan\u201d card?  Don\u2019t, she\u2019s going to be disappointed, too.  Leo\u2019s not very sexy when he\u2019s on Quaaludes (frequently) or when he\u2019s repeatedly cheating on his wives (constantly). Whether you\u2019re male or female, it\u2019s hard to feel much affinity with DiCaprio\u2019s character (Jordan Belfort) and DiCaprio\u2019s acting, while physical in nature (think Matthew Perry-The Whole Nine Yards), isn\u2019t compelling.  Jonah Hill\u2019s portrayal of Donnie Azoff provides some laughs, but ultimately his character isn\u2019t very likeable either. The movie is so uninspiring the only thoughts it provokes are along the lines of, \u201cIf I had that much money, there\u2019s no way I would have screwed things up so badly.\u201d  This movie is for hard-core Scorsese fans only.",

Just because it was released during the Xmas holiday does not mean you can bring the kids and the grandparents. The film is rated R for a reason. As a parent, you should've used a bit more common sense and at least research the film on parent review sites before taking the family.\r 2. If you've seen Martin Scorsese's previous films, you know what you are getting yourself into. Goodfellas says the f-bomb 300 times. This film will say it at least 506 times. If you can't handle that amount of language in films like Goodfellas, then what makes you think you can watch this film and enjoy it?\r 3. There is a few short sex scenes, but the detail is what you experience in any rated R film these days. It's no way close to full detail like an actual porn film and anyone saying that is just exaggerating. Some of the scenes did drag a bit, but like any Scorsese film there's a reason for it and it's a opening hook that leads to a further altercation with the characters. The protagonist did lived a wild life!\r Did I enjoy the film? Well... yes I did! In a sense, this film shows anyone that when you have the ambition to move up in life from nothing, you can be whatever you want to be. But with that in mind, you can loose everything if you loose moral values and live a life that progresses to go out of control (stealing, drugs, etc). If you have an open-mind and don't mind Scorsese's work and way of directing, then you'll enjoy the film.\r If you hate language, drugs, and typical rated R sexual situations/nudity, then you're better off watching another film.",

However, the film is intriguingly skillful. It uses Scorsese's mastery and that of course along with an extremely able line up of actors and crew in virtually all aspects of film making except one.\rThe question what does the film tell?\r To make a long story short, it basically is a sales pitch.\rScorsese sells us - no matter if we are hungry-for-success-sales-persons or such that feel disadvantaged by the ongoings of financial crisis or stock market in general seeking for insight or if we just want to know what's behind it - he sells us the life style of this super-dooper-bigwig-broker probably as good as it gets.\rIt's a train of thrill and excitement going uphill and there is a sense of tweaked decency in context of either keeping the game going or not being true to oneself.\r Having said that, the film is based on the book of the very broker, Jordan Belfort and, thus, serves as a commercial for it, not mentioning the probability of royalties paid to Mr. Belfort along with the film.\rHence, the film reflects Mr. Belfort's perspective. A salesman who proficiently peddles his story and along with it his view of the world. The insight material and sadly the film making art too chiefly serves as bait to catch our attention.\rThe man behind this broker's features remains in the dark. There may be a lot of so called private matters, nonetheless, when it comes to questions of Belfort's identity the film draws a blank. Nothing. What drives him? Given the vehicle nature of money, the mystery prevails about where he wants it to take him.\r So it is cut down to a fast ride with nowhere to go. That can be fun, sure. But a three hour movie of the world's most celebrated film maker? I don't know.\rWhy could Belfort go so far away from himself? Why do only external limits seem to have an effect in his world, where and when and how did he loose touch with seemingly all of his inner values, feelings? Such an obviously empty person is hard to bear, despite the excellent performance of Leonardo Di Caprio. So isn't there any human left inside this broker-dummy? The film doesn't tell.\rEven when Belfort finally hits rock bottom, how does he deal with real life, his poor past, relatives, friends, loneliness? Well the film doesn't tell. It's cut to tennis in the joint, and cut to a continuous selling career. In this respect, the film, this form of the American Dream without any inner cultural, emotional response, even seemingly proposing the utter irrelevance of such things, unwillingly, is a horror film.\r I do not want to spoil your movie night, nevertheless, I have the feeling it's not necessary to embellish Mr. Belfort's memoirs any further. So, go see it if you must, it can be fun, then again, you might as well save the money for a rainy day.",

I mean the movie is fun and catches you for a while, but after two hours seeing nothing more but drugs abuse and undiscriminated sex activity it becomes boring. The same message of excess could be transmitted with a quarter or less of what is shown in the film. When the protagonist finally is crushed by his lifestyle you expect the most amazing and genius part of a classic Scorsese's picture, the fall of the character until his destruction. However this thing does not occur at anytime; its true that he lost important things but there is nothing more. In that sense this film is not like his other ones, for example Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas and The Departed. That enormous learning about life does not fit within this story and that's a shame because it could. What saves the movie is DiCaprio performance, although he never gives a bad one; the edition is marvelous as always and all the scenarios that are used are amazing.",

Any film that lionises a low life like Jordan Belfort does not deserve a good review.  Jordan Belfort is, was and always will be pond scum and a bottom feeder.

There's plenty of parties, drugs, liquor and sex. Scorsese is the master of depicting the passage of time with imagery and voice-over.\r The acting was splendid. DiCaprio nails the role of a free of concern stockbroker with more money than he can spend. Jonah Hill does a nice job as a supporting character. The remaining supporting cast, including Matthew McConaughey did wonderful jobs and true justice to their roles.\r The message here is the same one Scorsese has already dealt with in Goodfellas. Then he followed a bunch of gangsters around as they rose and fell while they reaped what they sow. This time the main characters are a party loving horde of stockbrokers who swindle rich people out of their millions without anything weighing down on their conscience.\r The subject matter was so intriguing, and Scorsese had so much to tell that I thought that the length was justified. When a movie does not drag for a moment despite going on for three hours, you have to admit that you were glad that it was this long. I'm sure it will be watched and re-watched by countless zealous fans of Scorsese for decades to come.\r The time depicted is the 1980s. After a stock market crash, Jordan Belfort finds himself out of work. He builds from the scratch, hiring promising but uneducated good-for-nothings who make millions along with him. The trade is so lucrative it is unbelievable. But of course when you attract this much attention, there are bound to be people who would look into your life and try to find your weaknesses, which in this case were hunts for evidence which might prove that the wealth that Belfort has accumulated was acquired by illegal means. So ensues a game of wits where the FBI and the stockbrokers try to come out on top.\r The tone is always light and humorous. Nigh a scene passes without being followed by a comical one cracking you up. Matthew McConaughey is the first one to show us what the movie would be like. That scene at the restaurant where he mentors Jordan on how to live his life was one of the best scenes. But the movie is replete with such memorable scenes. Both Jonah Hill and DiCaprio delivered such strong performances and were so funny that I couldn't help but applaud them for their efforts. I think they both deserve the nominations they have received at the Oscars.\r There are more scenes of nudity and sex than I could count, but they were used with finesse. They never seemed lewd, although that word was passed around a lot. Everyone was fond of snorting cocaine. The level of partying displayed left me envious, which I think was the whole point. It had a purpose, which was to make us learn a lesson when the fates of these characters eventually catch up with them.\r The first hour and a half was about nothing except for care-free sex, earning loads of money and taking in various drugs. I trusted Scorsese to change gears midway and he did exactly that. The movie became somewhat sober but still did not change the mood so much as I've seen in other movies which became atrocious the minute they became serious.\r The characters clearly enjoyed their lives to the fullest. And when someone is having fun, you can't help but root for them when the bad guys (which might be the good ones in real life) seek to bring them down to their own level. It did feel like Scorsese was celebrating debauchery. But I think the ending was done pretty well and succeeded to show us what you get when you wrong someone.\r I feel like Scorsese has created a great piece which will be admired in the coming years if not now. But yet I think the film lacked the greatness he achieved with his earlier films like Goodfellas and The Departed. But I might be wrong. Who knows how I'll feel about it if I watched it a couple of times more. It did feel like a film that wanted to achieve more hence the longer running time, and I could not put my finger on anything it messed up, so I might be feeling differently about it if I was asked in a few years' time. But this is Scorsese we're talking about. Even if he makes a film that people will jump to criticize, it's only because we have become accustomed to expect nothing less than greatness from him.",
