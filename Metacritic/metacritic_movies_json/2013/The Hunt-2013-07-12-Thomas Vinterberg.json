  "rating": 8.4,
  "release_date": "2013-07-12",
  "summary": "A teacher lives a lonely life, all the while struggling over his son's custody. His life slowly gets better as he finds love and receives good news from his son, but his new luck is about to be brutally shattered by a lie.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "An outstanding lead performance by Mads Mikkelsen (who won best actor for the role at Cannes in 2012) anchors this hauntingly layered and nuanced drama of a man falsely accused of a terrible deed.",
    "Mikkelsen, who is not given to sympathetic roles, has never been better. This is cinema that sinks its claws into your back.",
    "For anyone with even a halfway developed sense of justice The Hunt may prove stressful, frustrating, even enraging, but it’s also an unbelievably effective watch, that, if nothing else signals an undeniable return to form for Vinterberg, and yet another blistering performance from Mikkelsen. See it, if only for the debates it will cause afterward.",
    "This is filmmaking of a high order, even though the production's scale is modest and the climax is not without its facile contrivances.",
    "Propelled by Mads Mikkelsen’s shattering performance as the blameless man whose life threatens to be destroyed, the film is superbly acted by a cast that never strikes a false note or softens the impact with consolatory sentiment.",
    "Vinterberg has created a modern horror story about a man’s descent into a Kafkaesque nightmare.",
    "Thomas Vinterberg (“The Celebration”) directs with restraint that makes the story all the more affecting.",
    "It’s a pretty conventional “Lifetime Original Movie” sort of story. But co-writer/director Thomas Vinterberg (“Dear Wendy”) makes it work by building a sense of frustrating unease into it all.",
    "The director makes clear that everyone means well — the headmistress, protective of her students; the parents, trying to shield children from things they shouldn't know about just yet; the investigators asking questions carefully, trying to see their way through ambiguous answers.",
    "Thomas Vinterberg’s film puts us just on the edge of screaming frustration; Mads Mikkelsen’s terrific performance (for which he won the best actor award at Cannes in 2012) only makes the film more powerful.",
    "It is a devastating film to watch.",
    "The movie works beautifully by bringing forward the delicate subject of guilt via passivity.",
    "What a knotty, frighteningly real drama The Hunt is.",
    "Beautifully performed and tough as nails, Vinterberg's social drama could not be any more timely.",
    "Vinterberg keeps us guessing right up to and after an end shot that suggests how tough some viral rumours are to shake off.",
    "It is forthright, powerful, composed and directed with clarity and overwhelming force, yet capable of great subtlety and nuance.",
    "Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen delivers an astonishingly restrained and expressive central performance in The Hunt, an engrossing psycho-social drama by Thomas Vinterberg.",
    "The Hunt offers a powerful, provocative study of mob mentality and the fabric of trust.",
    "This is thematically rich material; unfortunately, like a few too many dramas from the past decade, The Hunt resists expressive uses of style, opting instead for gently bobbing handheld camerawork. It's an actor-friendly approach.",
    "It’s to the star’s immense credit that his spellbinding appeal provides a tension that the script’s funereal pace often lacks.",
    "The film is in part an exceedingly black comedy that parodies proper society's eager, self-righteous naïveté on the subject of its children.",
    "While The Hunt skillfully puts viewers through the wringer, it’s often for no higher purpose than pushing buttons and generating outrage.",
    "Mikkelsen impresses here as a warm-hearted man who finds himself caught up in a situation way beyond his control.",
    "As emotionally devastating as it is, The Hunt is nevertheless rather schematic and pat.",
    "The subject matter, already troubling, is made even more so by Vinterberg’s almost sadomasochistic penchant for propping up Lucas’s martyrdom. He’s gunning for prey, too.",
    "None of the complexity of that initial interaction between teacher and lovestruck little girl carries over into the town’s reaction, which closely resembles that of the villagers in \"Frankenstein.\" It’s like watching a deer run from shotguns for two hours — it evokes some sympathy, but that’s about all.",
    "While The Hunt strives mightily to provoke outrage, get the blood boiling, pluck the heartstrings and open the tear ducts, it never quite succeeds – a function of a narrative whose failures of credibility, finally, prevent a viewer from wholeheartedly embracing what director Thomas Vinterberg wants us to feel.",
    "Imbued as it is with a sense of discomforting truth, it is a worthwhile examination of human nature -- and one with a message well worth heeding.",
    "The Hunt doesn’t know where to stop. It is undermined with a short, unsatisfying epilogue whose shocking final moment isn’t enough to justify its inclusion.",
    "Unlike in The Celebration, the cruelty and suffering in The Hunt feel both overly schematic and intellectually muddled."

But a worthwhile experience if you appreciate challenging films. The lead actor's performance is riveting, frustrating, heartbreaking. I have no idea how often a child's claim of this type of abuse turns out to be false, but the film makes an interesting case for how this seemingly impossible thing could happen. Also interesting is the fact that after \"The Celebration,\" his earlier film that explores some similar issues in a scathing way, the director this time narrows his focus to the accused. Great filmmaking.",

I had to pause many a time to just try and collect myself a bit and not punch my computer screen. Mads Mikkelsen is absolutely stunning in this film and turns in a terrifically believable and authentic performance as the accused teacher. The film does a great job portraying the hysteria that surrounds an accusation of this magnitude and the resulting anger and confusion. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking at times and the direction from Thomas Vinterberg is fantastic.

      "content": "Back in 1998, Danish filmmaker Thomas Vinterberg shook up the cinematic establishment with \"The Celebration,\" a devastatingly powerful debut which explores shocking revelations and the power of a lie, and the incalculable, irreparable damageBack in 1998, Danish filmmaker Thomas Vinterberg shook up the cinematic establishment with \"The Celebration,\" a devastatingly powerful debut which explores shocking revelations and the power of a lie, and the incalculable, irreparable damage it can cause. Fourteen years later, Vinterberg returns with \"The Hunt,\" which shares many similarities with its celebrated predecessor, and it has received high praise at both the Cannes and London film festivals. \"The Hunt,\" a Palme d'Or nominee, revisits familiar ground, where Vinterberg continues to fan the flames of social unrest in a far more conventional manner.\r Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a kindergarten teacher in a small, hunting village in Denmark, who is recovering from a painful divorce and working to receive greater custody of his teenage son. He is best friends with the couple that lives next door, Theo and Agnes (Larsen and Hassing), and has a fond relationship with their daughter Klara (Wedderkopp), who is also one of his young pupils. One day, the young girl says some odd things which imply that Lucas is a sexual predator. Suddenly, the town closes ranks against him, and everyone assumes that children don't lie about such things. Klara, though she tries, is unable to take back her words.\r It’s a childlike act of revenge orchestrated by a little girl who doesn't know any better, and who is trying to avoid further embarrassment or torment. However, the narrative of the story is driven by the adults of this small town. Quickly shunned by a community that once welcomed him, Lucas is left to absorb the nightmare alone, finding even his closest companions unsure of his innocence.\r Vinterberg maintains a human focus to the story, emphasizing strained relationships and universal suspicion, while capturing the essence of despair as the characters struggle to make sense out of a confusing and volatile situation. \"The Hunt” is unsettling and enraging to watch because of Lindholm’s forceful script and the incredibly vivid performances, most notably Mikkelsen’s sensational performance as the condemned man. The film's premise isn't anything particularly new, however, Mikkelsen's powerful performance creates a strong sense of empathy for Lucas which transcends this engrossing nightmare, where simply surviving doesn't mean your days as a target are over.",

However, if you want to see a good film that amuse you for nearly a couple of hours, you'd better think twice in double-clicking in that one... For me, the worst film i have seen since i saw 'To the wonder'. 1h 40 minutes to tell you not to believe every word the children say. I think there's no need in seeing that film to acquire that knowledge. The plot is based in a lie said by a little girl that her parents hardly ever listen and everybody knew was special. My score for this film is ZERO, but, i must insist, my score for the main actor is 10, amazing, as usually.",

And then for the rest of the movie we have basically a witch hunt like it's not 21st century Denmark but 15th century or something-system does not exist,no psychologist,no police,no law,no press,no anything except mad crowd thirsty for blood on one side and innocent victim on the other.Waste of time.",

The movie is completely ruined by the plot. The movie has absolutely outstanding cast and production, but plot is just full of logical plotholes and events that would never happen in real life. Just short example: first - psychologist or whoever he was (first to question the girl) would never be a man and secondly, no one in the world uses such direct questioning. Next, teacher has no right to initiate any said questioning, especially without any parental approval and sadly everything falls apart from there, because everything that goes on from that moment would not have happen in real functional world. In real world that teacher would stand in court of law for defamation, misconduct and enforcing psychological pressure on minors. In short: absolute BS plot which butchered otherwise well made movie.",

All theMads Mikkelsen’s best movie. The movie’s concept, whereby the main character suffers societal injustice,  is all too familiar in the face of today’s “cancel culture” and the greater flaw of human communication, i.e. miscommunication. All the children actors are very well cast and serve their roles well. Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a man who has been beaten into submission by society regarding his marriage, his child, and now his job. Lucas is being forced to give in and give up on the things he loves and enjoys and is ostracized by those who used to be his closest friends. The Hunt is a character study detailing how desperation and innocence can combine to form apparent guilt. The Hunt is shot in such a way that we feel the stigmas of the town and feel how despicable of a person Lucas seems to be, all while knowing that it isn’t true. We are led to believe that friendships are as strong as limp fetters and quickly turn to backstabs. Ultimately, The Hunt shows that the fundamentally flawed credibility of a system wherein guilt is implied and fake news is a given.",
