    "critic_reviews": [
        "Short Term 12 is a miracle of a movie. Beautifully written and perfectly played, all of human life is here: the good, the bad, the messy and the uplifting.",
        "It\u2019s one of the best movies of the year and one of the truest portrayals I\u2019ve ever seen about troubled teens and the people who dedicate their lives to trying to help them.",
        "A rare movie that serves both the head and the heart. The issues it broaches are achingly real, brought to vivid life by a consistently excellent cast.",
        "The resulting portrait is nothing short of a tiny filmmaking miracle. It\u2019s guaranteed to make you feel something \u2014 hopeful, probably, for Grace and her wards. And maybe even for the future of indie filmmaking.",
        "Short Term 12 is a small wonder, a film of exceptional naturalness and empathy that takes material about troubled teenagers and young adults that could have been generic and turns it into something moving and intimate.",
        "Brie Larson, as the caring but tormented Grace (who's pregnant and doesn't know if she has the faith to have her baby), and John Gallagher Jr., as her gentle-dweeb fellow worker Mason (who fears his love can't save her), show you what emotionally naked acting is all about.",
        "It's a delicate yet passionate creation, modest in scope but almost overwhelming in its emotional intricacy, ambition, and resonance. Easily one of the best films so far this year, it's a nearly perfect blend of pimple-faced naturalism, righteous moral fury, nuanced social insight, and unsentimental but devastating drama.",
        "Taking its time to let the world take shape, Short Term 12 builds to an involving series of mini-climaxes without tidying up every loose end.",
        "Short Term 12 is a roller coaster of every emotion, managing to be both heartwarming and heartrending at once.",
        "What might seem on paper a cloyingly sentimental heartwarmer becomes, in Cretton's hands, a briskly believable, often funny, always invigorating and ultimately wrenching story of emotional fortitude.",
        "Short Term 12, a low-budget feature only 96 minutes long, is a big deal on a small scale: for what it reveals of Mr. Cretton as a filmmaker \u2014 especially as a storyteller, and a director of actors within tautly constructed scenes \u2014 and of Ms. Larson's abundant talent.",
        "This compelling human drama finds fresh energy in the inspirational-teacher genre, constantly revealing new layers to its characters.",
        "A genuinely moving look at life in a group foster home that avoids most of the usual routes into viewers' hearts.",
        "Well-written, terrifically acted and compelling. It deftly avoids sentimentality and offers a window into the lives of believable, multilayered characters.",
        "The sophomore feature effort from director Destin Cretton (remaking and expanding upon his 2008 short), this movie avoids the numerous landmines awaiting someone venturing into this territory and, as a result, emerges triumphant.",
        "He (Cretton) just loves this place and these people so much, he wanted to give us more of them. For that, we should be grateful.",
        "Cretton shows as much care and kindness with the minutiae of the daily routine \u2014 as he does with the larger issues that plague these lives in flux. He also infuses his story with unexpected humor as the kids hassle each other \u2014 and their supervisors \u2014 on the road to healing.",
        "Rehab movies nearly always make me cringe, as if the audience needs to take medicine, as if hope needs to be force fed. Short Term 12, an exceptional film in every way, breaks the mold.",
        "[Brie Larson's] performance is something of a quiet revelation, and in turn, the same could be said of the film itself.",
        "The lead character\u2019s called Grace, but don\u2019t be put off: Cretton\u2019s tough-love snapshot of shattered youth is achingly moving rather than manipulative or mawkish.",
        "Short Term 12 wraps up with one of the most touchingly memorable last moments of any film this year. Despite a title that\u2019s hard to recall, this brief but resonant movie sticks with you.",
        "It\u2019s both a compelling group melodrama built around an appealing young cast and an immersive introduction into a social reality many of us haven\u2019t thought about.",
        "Short Term 12 isn\u2019t without drawbacks, occasionally dipping into a too-neat narrative tidiness and a self-conscious sloppiness. Yet the film\u2019s charms and ability to cut through jadedness despite the subject matter makes it a rarity \u2014 a modest indie that\u2019s feels like it\u2019s in it for the long haul.",
        "Brie Larson is a revelation as the linchpin of Short Term 12. An industrious young actress, her performance here is remarkably natural and understated.",
        "Short Term 12 is a triumph of modesty.",
        "Because Short Term 12 is a small movie about a challenging subject, you may have to accept my word that actress Brie Larson and director Destin Cretton are bright discoveries, but it shouldn\u2019t be long before the wider world can see these talents with the naked eye.",
        "Short Term 12 is that rare movie gutsy enough to tell the truth about love: that it\u2019s not a poetic longing or a magical-thinking happy ending, but a skill. And, the film suggests, we all have the capacity to learn it.",
        "Any director who sees Short Term 12 will want to cast Larson in something. This movie puts her on the map.",
        "Larson shines as an adult staffer assigned to keep these self-destructive kids safe while they work with therapists.",
        "It doesn\u2019t happen all at once, nor does the film imply that coming to terms with one\u2019s past is any kind of panacea. Grace\u2019s problems are long term, but, like her adolescent charges, one has the sense she\u2019ll get by.",
        "Even as the gathering melodramatic storms threaten to swamp this pungent slice of life, Mr. Cretton manages to earn your tears honestly.",
        "At its best, the film conveys a wealth of compelling details that only an insider, or at least someone who\u2019s done extensive and thorough research, would think worthy of singling out.",
        "There's tremendous dramatic value to the aching and sometimes devastating scenes that home in on these kids' private torments.",
        "For all its humanistic warmth and undoubted charm, Short Term 12 just never quite rings true.",
        "This is a small film about a society of castoffs, and while it\u2019s beautifully acted and often moving, it\u2019s also predictable, because it keeps wresting itself into familiar forms.",
        "There's a too-cute-to-be-true ending to this US indie movie by the much-acclaimed young director Destin Cretton; I couldn't buy it, and found myself wondering if I had kept the receipt for the rest of the film too."

It is a simple film on paper, butShort Term 12 gives itself time to take shape, but once we are on board it ends up becoming greatly powerful and passionate in its telling of vast emotional intricacy, determination and resonance. It is a simple film on paper, but overwhelmingly deep in life, body and soul. It is a heartwarming film and a heart wrenching film. By the end, we have a big smile on our faces and see that our characters\u2019 lives come full circle for the best intentions. You can\u2019t expect or want more from this film.\r Brie Larson gives a most natural performance as Grace who is in general charge of the facility, though she is not the boss, a psychologist or even a therapist. She is simply a friendly, kind and interactive role model for these hardened kids. Larson has been a gem on the indie screen for the last few years and she certainly has a long and lustrous career ahead of her. She carries the show here.\r What is so wonderful about this film is that we get to meet and follow more than one resident\u2019s story. This isn\u2019t a plot overdrive, everything adds up justifiably and we should, in fact, be grateful. The film is perceived to avoid the loophole of sentimentality and offer a window into convincing and manifold characters. Destin Daniel Cretton, the director, reportedly worked as a staff member at a place such like the one shown in Short Term 12. This shows through his material and ability to bring together multiple stories with such fluency and emotional impact. He ensures his characters are worthy of love and attention.\r A new arrival to the foster home, Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) seems to be one of the most deeply troubled, and is a \u2018cutter\u2019 as they call it. It is through Jaydan that we learn more about Grace\u2019s dark past, as they strike a sweet and subtle connection with one another. One may doubt Grace\u2019s ability to stand in the position of authority that she holds; Grace is yet to see closure with her own issues, but she is great at what she does through her kindness of heart. It\u2019s no surprise why she does this job: she doesn\u2019t want anyone to have to suffer the same way she did.\r Due to her deeply routed internal struggles, Grace struggles to give real intimacy; she cannot commit and is prone to sudden emotional bursts that seem completely irrelevant at the time. This is obviously a problem for her boyfriend of three years, Mason (John Gallagher Jr.). Mason is a nice guy and does exceedingly well not to grab his bags and head for the hills; he will fight for what he believes in. Mason tells two wonderful stories that act as opening and closure for the film. One is funny and sets the day-to-day tone of conversation and spirit in the workplace, whereas the other is one of inspiration and romance that ends the picture suggesting that all the characters have taken a path of elevation.",

The film allows for these characters to fully live and have dimension, and much of it's core and heart, comes from the interaction of the actors. The director is also very successful in capturing the frailty of children's lives and expectations, as is in the way it captures the hardship of a young relationship and the steps to becoming a responsible adult. The threads that the film successfully builds are as delicate as they are strong in it's emotional impact. Brie Larson has a fantastic performance as the experienced, yet frail Grace, as does Kaitlyn Dever as the young Jayden. The film also benefits from the beautiful cinematography from Brett Pawlak. A great film not to be missed.",

It was truly a film that, when it ended, I was left sitting there begging for there to be more to watch. Featuring stellar performances from Brie Larson, John Gallagher, Kaitlyn Dever, Keith Stanfield, and the entire cast, Short Term 12 is an emotionally powerful film about a group home for teenagers with extremely troubled pasts. Respectful about its subjects, the film's characters show incredible depth and the way they are able to dissect and reveal so much about this many characters in just an hour and a half run time is impeccable. It is easy to tell how well written this film is because its characters feel like people you know. You could see them just walking down the street, they are just so real.

From first shot to last, the film isWriter-director Destin Cretton's Short Term 12 is a marvel, an intimate look into the life of a young woman named Grace, a mature, resourceful, and damaged caretaker at a juvenile housing facility. From first shot to last, the film is stunning; it is emotionally vast, beautifully and intimately shot, and an incredibly acted success.\r Short Term 12's subject matter lends itself to immediacy, and so the film presents its characters in stride, building up Grace, her paramour co-worker, ally, and confidant Mason, and the teenagers in their care with small, detailed brushstrokes  for example, we learn who Mason is primarily through his natural storytelling ability as he introduces the facility to a new staff member; with anger-brimming older boy Marcus, it's a profound but not unbelievably polished rap session. These moments are expository without ever feeling forced or out of place; Cretton's mantra seems to favor an almost voyeuristic naturalism above all else. There are a few scant moments where the writing takes a turn for the more forced, especially when the script plays for laughs and the jokes stand out from the rest of the dialogue because they are so obviously structured for punchlines. These are easily forgiven, however, as the film quickly slips into its deeply sympathetic stages, teasing out the wracking pain and broken pasts buried within these kids, who quickly demonstrate that they're far more than the band of colorful misfits they initially present as. The aforementioned Marcus as the facility's veteran resident and a newcomer, Jayden, whose  attitude and scarred over past most closely resemble Grace, play the primary fulcrums for Mason and Grace to pivot around. Instead of one great urgency that drives the narrative forward, there is a looser, short-story style that weaves its way through the film, thus adhering to its dropped-in, naturalistic feel. The conflicts these kids (and other adults!) introduce and the sympathies they engender are utilized as ways to explore, primarily, Grace's own frustrations, weaknesses, aspirations, and pain. Grace is the all-encompassing center stage here, and at its core, the film is very introspective, an elegant psychological portrait that strikes a near-perfect balance between what it shows and what it leaves for the viewer to surmise.\r So, of course, we must talk about Brie Larson's superlative, sumptuous performance as Grace. This is as close of an embodiment of the now mythical strong female character as you're likely to see all year. She's immediately admirable and likable  it's clear that she cares for these children and operates with a generous compassion and patience, but her balancing flaws are what make her truly stand out. Instead of a few individual negative traits (like the general impishness that infects every manic pixie dream girl derivative, or, say, emotional volatility  because, you know, women are crazy), her demons form an almost terrifying  certainly tragically  cohesive whole. She's constantly receding from some past open wound, and it makes her at times prideful, stubborn, defiant, pitiful, and difficult. Her past and her person come together to form a character that understands how to fight through pain, and demonstrates courage through her resilience and fire, but is never quite sanctified and all the more laudably grounded for it. Though in broad strokes it is a rich and comprehensive and powerful portrayal, there are a few pinprick moments where the direction does seem to recede into comfortable cliche  do we ever need another shot of a character looking vacant and troubled in the shower? Still, a few of these are easily forgiven, and the larger picture painted is still breathtaking. This centerpiece that is Grace owes equal dues to Cretton's heartfelt script and Larson's performance, the latter of which runs the gamut between optimistically aloof, passionate, distant, angry, and, when earned, triumphant, and she leaves nothing on the table.\r Larson would stick out like a sore thumb, however, if her supporting cast didn't all rise to the challenge to extend the tapestry of her character into a fully realized world populated with all sorts of interesting. As Mason, John Gallager Jr. gives a far less showy but quietly stellar performance as Grace's partner in all things; if I had to nitpick, there are moments where he suffers from Gary Stu syndrome, but he has enough to do to quickly rise up as a formidably substantial character on his own. When Grace runs into adversaries, instead of being heartless bureaucratic hardasses like the DMV caricatures administrative types are usually presented as, they offer counter-arguments that are both logical and passionate, and Grace is far from always right. But we continue to root for her in tremendous ways, because she seems so knowable, because she's heartwrenchingly thorough, because this story, in spite of its sometimes angsty trappings, comes across as so personal and real.",

Mr. Cretton proved that the opposite can be true for this film is wonderfully edited and plays out smooth as silk as it tells the tale of staffers in a foster care facility and the problems they experience with their teen age wards. It should be noted that Mr. Cretton worked in such a facility so there is legitimacy and honesty in his writing about it. There are subplots and small divergences which make for an interesting cinema experience. Ms. Larson is a talented actress with natural beauty and ability and the script affords her the opportunity to utilize her thespian skills so that you are ab;e tp identify with her and the difficulties in her life. In spite of all of the travails facing these workers and wards,, the movie is uplifting and gives us all hope and the ability to believe that no one is beyond help and redemption. I enthusiastically recommend it and give the film an 8 rating.. Watch for some of the cast to be mentioned when Oscar time rolls around because there are performances in this film you will remember for a long time to come.",

Strongest is the incredible script by Destin Cretton and the wonderful characters, most especially the supporting characters that give credibility to a story about foster care facilities. Yes, Brie Larson is stellar and John Gallagher, Jr. is incredible with a kind of chemistry rarely on screen, but the small performances of the supporting cast are what really gave this film heart. It is heartbreakingly empathetic in ways only films can be. I cannot wait to see what director Destin Daniel Cretton.",

The plot goes in one direction, and then, literally 15 or 20 minutes before the end, the film goes \"lol, just kidding\" and everyone lives happily ever after. It's disgustingly sweet, completely unrealistic, and it feels like it was changed at the last moment because someone felt the original ending was too much of a bummer. The result is a fairly powerful, excellently acted drama that suddenly evaporates because, hey, it's a film and in films everything is always fine. So much wasted potential...",

This movie tells the story of a group of young foster-care home supervisorsThis movie came with a surprise, keeping everything so simple. The director's first full length feature which is actually based on his short movie of the same name. This movie tells the story of a group of young foster-care home supervisors and teenagers who live under their observation.\r A realistic movie with well balanced between characters and its narration. It was very much original subject and also in a believable manner. The movie with not-so-popular actors had achieved something every beginner filmmaker wanted to prove their direction skills. From screenplay to performances, it was outstanding.\r It all begins with a character Grace, a staff at a foster house facility and her co-worker as well her boyfriend, Mason. When a new staff joins them, soon, an another new kid called Jayden brought into the house under the supervision. After some incident Grace and Jayden begin to merge in emotionally for having a similar kinda previous events. Grace gets disturbed and her life begins to trouble the present. With all this, how she gonna face the current situation is the movie to be told in the remains.\r It had a very good opening sequence. Later on it went little slow but I liked as it was described in such pace to bring quality in drama. The second half is what everyone is going to love the movie for carrying striking storyline. The sustainable pace and story with expansion in broad was the highlight of the last quarter of the movie narration.\r As I expected it was not a commercial product, but definitely it will be recognizable in film festival arenas. It is not your usual movie that you had seen in Hollywood. Honestly, one of the 2013's best movie drama. 'Short Term 12' is the movie will be a turning point for many in their career, especially for the actress and the director.",

The structure of the script may be familiar and follow a rudimentary process but it certainly isn't narrowed down to a typical climatic edge but breeds maturity whilst suffering and battling its own characters. Destin Daniel Cretton; the writer-director, surpasses its witty script through his brilliant execution skills and offers an adequate response to the raised questions in here. Brie Larson pulls off her role convincingly despite not getting the expected support from her supporting cast. It is short on technical aspects like sound department but is fulfilling in editing and its camera work which makes it pleasing to encounter as it keeps it light; contradict to its premise. The minor dilemma in here would be the priority of the character and its perspective that is kept above the plot track which bars the range of the feature a bit. Short Term 12 has a potential to not only run for a longer term but rule wiser and safer as it breeds smarter approach for the essential future generation.",
