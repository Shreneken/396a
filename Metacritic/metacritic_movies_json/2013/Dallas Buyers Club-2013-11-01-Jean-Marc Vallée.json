He started taking the FDA approved AZT, the only legal drug available in the U.S, which brought him to the brink of death. To survive, he smuggled non-toxic, anti-viral medications from all over the world yet still illegal in the U.S. Other AIDS patients sought out his medications forgoing hospitals, doctors and AZT. With the help of his doctor, Eve Saks and a fellow patient, Rayon, Ron unintentionally created the Dallas Buyers Club, the first of dozens which would form around the country, providing its paying members with these alternative treatments. The clubs, growing in numbers and clientele, were brought to the attention of the FDA and pharmaceutical companies which waged an all out war on Ron.… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Dallas Buyers Club is one of the best pictures of the year.",
    "Vallée, working with a lean, lively script by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, neatly avoids excess, letting Woodroof’s terrific yarn stand on its own and getting out of the way of his extraordinary actors, who channel the story without condescension or manipulative cheats.",
    "Dallas Buyers Club represents the best of what independent film on a limited budget can achieve — powerful, enlightening and not to be missed.",
    "What's remarkable about Dallas Buyers Club is its lack of sentimentality. The movie, like its star, is all angles and elbows, earning its emotion through sheer pragmatism.",
    "It wouldn’t be surprising to hear about moviegoers demanding their money back after seeing The Dallas Buyers Club, but not because the film isn’t good. It’s actually very nearly great.",
    "Jean-Marc Vallee’s film is anything but standard, thanks to an astonishing performance by Matthew McConaughey.",
    "This classic tale of a little guy taking on giants benefits from being essentially true, and from accomplished filmmaking, but most of all from the beautiful vitality of Mr. McConaughey's performance.",
    "This is a bold, drastic and utterly persuasive inhabiting of a doomed fighter by a performer who has graduated from the shirtless rom-com Romeo of the last decade to indie-film actor du jour.",
    "McConaughey's performance isn't just about the weight loss. It's about gaining compassion, even wisdom, and it's awesome.",
    "At once a fascinating character study and a scathing indictment of the role of the medical-pharmaceutical complex in exacerbating the AIDS crisis, the fact-based Dallas Buyers Club is one of the best films of the year.",
    "Thanks to the superb screenplay by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack and the brilliant, brave performances by the cast, Dallas Buyers Club gets just about everything right, save for a few over-the-top scenes that hammer home points that have already been made.",
    "It’s a remarkable story, vividly and urgently told by French-Canadian director Vallée (“The Young Victoria”) from a pointed, schmaltz-free script by Craig Borten and Melissa Wallack.",
    "McConaughey makes sure we feel his tenacity and triumphs in the treatment of AIDS. His explosive, unerring portrayal defines what makes an actor great, blazing commitment to a character and the range to make every nuance felt.",
    "McConaughey's flirty drawl and rowdy energy have never been put to better dramatic use than they are in Dallas Buyers Club.",
    "It’s all about the performances. McConaughey and Leto don’t just give voice to the disenfranchised of the 1980s, but all people suddenly faced with impossible challenges.",
    "If we admire anything about him, it’s entrepreneurship; there’s something uniquely American about a guy outrunning his own death by turning suffering into profit. And as a judge asks, why shouldn’t a dying man be allowed to try any remedy for his disease?",
    "Director Jean-Marc Vallee dutifully progresses from one obvious scene to the next. Solid work but unspectacular, perhaps figuring the boldness of his characters' words and actions can be artistic enough. And it is, in the hands of a temporarily reformed sex symbol and his unexpected leading lady.",
    "The real halo here belongs to McConaughey. He does justice to Ron’s story and to his own quicksilver talent.",
    "If not wholly convincing as an ‘issues’ movie, this memoir is a triumph as an actors’ showcase; with McConaughey and Leto giving the performances of their careers.",
    "Get this — Matthew McConaughey is currently the most exciting acting talent at work in movies. Next up, the simple business of a Christopher Nolan.",
    "McConaughey and Leto's performances are also the saviors of Vallee's film, which has a way of belaboring certain points and, in the process, robbing his film of no small amount of momentum.",
    "This is a movie that traffics in deep hindbrain emotions: fear and rage and lust and, above all, the pure animal drive to go on living.",
    "If Woodroof is the movie’s guts, Rayon is its heart, and Leto (TV’s “My So-Called Life,” “Alexander”) is stunningly perfect, even when the story veers ever so slightly into expected territory.",
    "Even with some flaws and flailing, Dallas Buyers Club is a rough, raw, ragged and exhilarating ride.",
    "It’s a formulaic story that takes full advantage of these broad, familiar formulas to win viewers, but finds enough unique detail to retain its own identity.",
    "Only 20 minutes in and you’re not going to think of another lead who could pull off this kind of reckoning — tangy, furious and about to become whip-smart.",
    "At just under two hours, it's a little long, but the blend of biting character study and campaigning pharmaceutical docudrama is zesty and memorable.",
    "[McConaughey] delivers a twitchy, hostile performance on par with anything he's done since he escaped the rom com cul-de-sac.",
    "Dallas Buyers Club is an indelible story about one man’s unwillingness to go gently into that good night, and the personal growth he experiences along the way.",
    "This is a straight-up portrait of a man who figured out a way to cling to life longer than anyone expected and, in the process, learned to let the world in.",
    "The limits of Dallas Buyers Club are the limits most true stories come up against, which are the facts. A good story lands and reverberates. In real life, stories have a way of just stopping and leaving you a bit unsatisfied. The latter is what happens in this movie, but perhaps that couldn't be avoided.",
    "Regardless of who sees or doesn't see Dallas Buyers Club, however, the movie does what it sets out to do by providing a striking portrait of a remarkable character and offering a history lesson to those too young to remember how things were for AIDS sufferers during the dark ages of the 1980s.",
    "By the end of this sincerely calculated, always watchable movie, everything has burned away but the fury, including whatever you may think or have thought about the actor you’re looking at. That’s how good the performance is.",
    "McConaughey is first-rate throughout, on top of every dramatic and blackly comic situation, even when the character isn't on top of anything.",
    "If Dallas Buyers Club falls somewhat short in the categories of historical chronicle, emotional wallop, and information delivery, its conscientious attempts to portray a group of people in trouble in a troubled time delivers mini-epiphanies in a series of small doses. And that isn't nothing.",
    "Through its detailed depiction of the lead character and McConaughey's outstanding portrayal, Dallas Buyers Club enlightens compellingly without sermonizing.",
    "There’s something undeniably affecting about that trajectory, which allows McConaughey to turn his character into an empathetic figure — one whose prejudice fades as his fighting spirit intensifies — without sacrificing his rapscallion spirit. He’s the same loudmouthed macho braggart at the end of the movie than he was at the beginning, but now he’s a loudmouthed macho braggart with purpose.",
    "It's been 20 years since Tom Hanks put a movie star's face on the AIDS crisis in \"Philadelphia.\" Since then, Hollywood has largely ignored one of the most tragic chapters of the 20th century. Considering that track record, even a movie as imperfect as Dallas Buyers Club is something worth celebrating.",
    "The narrative only really stumbles because its tone never manages to convince on the level that McConaughey's performance eventually does. With its subdued approach, Dallas Buyers Club stops just short of an emotional payoff.",
    "Despite the fine performances from McConaughey and Leto, tightly coiled editing that keeps the story moving and a nicely measured balance between drama and comedy (McConaughey is often a hoot), Dallas Buyers Club still sometimes feels like it's missing one more grace note.",
    "What distinguishes Borten and Wallack’s screenplay is its refusal to sentimentalize by providing humbling epiphanies to set Ron on the right path and endow him with empathy.",
    "The film manages to educate without ever feeling didactic, and to entertain in the face of what would, to any other character, seem like a grim life sentence.",
    "Conventional but never sanctimonious, it balances out its familiar recovery angle with a healthy measure of sardonic wit.",
    "Despite its downbeat context (a plague at its height), the movie is a crowd-­pleaser — graceful and funny enough to distract you from its gaps and elisions.",
    "Despite its clichéd elements, Dallas Buyers Club is a fierce celebration of the unpredictable power that belongs to the outcast, the despised, the pariah. That’s not a story of the ‘80s, it’s a story of always.",
    "There is warmth and intelligence here, and undeniable sincerity, but also a determination, in the face of much painful and fascinating history, to play it safe."

In setting up his \"club,\" his homophobia is challenged when he partners with a trans character (Jared Leto). The story unfolds at a steady pace, but it's really about the two leads. McConaughey imbues his character with much of the swagger typical of his personality, but manages to show emotion once or twice. It's Leto who completely transforms himself into a sweet, sensitive woman and creates the film's most poignant peaks. The movie is a bit too long and repetitive in the setbacks, but it still manages to tell the story effectively with award-potential performances.",

The mainDallas Buyers Club is a well developed movie because it shows deeply the human aspect when it is facing enormous adversities, which resemble the Greek tragedy, that in this case treats of a man against HIV and the American FDA. The main character portrayed us all in common life, fighting for what we deserve, getting up after several falls, but there is always someone or something that wants to take you down for money reasons. Beneath this primary message we can discover one about acceptance and changing ones minds, add to this the film transmit the idea of being who you wish; here is the character of Raynon who takes care of these. Despite that these topics seem very unoriginal, is the way in which is shown that makes the difference, turning the environment very visceral. First we have the protagonist: who is very well accompanied by a travesty that doesn't fear of saying what he thinks and a doctor that questions everything that is imposed. Of course they all are amazingly performed, highlighting Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. Another interesting thing is how this movie manages music and sound in order to represent in a better way the life of these sick people. Obviously it is accomplish by a strong direction and script.",

Also, maybe the depiction of AIDS patients is a little too blunt for what was this condition really was in 1985. The homophobia looks a bit pushed, but it is Texas, so I wouldn't know if that would correspond to reality.\r Great acting performances - the only problem is this plot has been a little overused before, even if again, it is a real story, and therefore lacking the rocambolesque bit to it. If you are willing to forget that this film is not like others, and wants (for once) to be a close-to-reality account, and hence you are willing to not expect to be overflown with pity and compassion at all times, then it's probably at least a 9 for you.",

This film was the one that finally proved that to me! In this film, he portrays Ron Woodruff, a bull rider and electrician who tests positively for HIV. The film is loosely based on the true story of his buyers club that he starts for several other HIV patients with the use of illegal drugs. The film boasts a solid and talented cast. McConaughey gives what is, in my opinion, his best performance yet by far! Jennifer Garner also gives an honest performance as a headstrong doctor. Jared Leto returns to the big screen after his four-year absence from filmmaking as a transvestite named Rayon. His performance, along with McConaughey's is what really propels the film's conflict. Overall, the pacing is slow in some spots, but manages all the while to remain entertaining, thanks to the Oscarworthy performances from McConaughey and Leto. Definitely check this one out for an interesting take on a great true story!",

No wonder Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto won Oscars for this film. They're both brilliant in showcasing two faces of AIDS sufferers which oppose each other; one being a fighter doing all they can to prolong their life and the other succumbing to their disease by giving in and not taking their treatment seriously. What's beautiful is the characters themselves are polar opposites and this disease brings them together which results in helping many people.\r Unlike Philadelphia which gave us a personal story which shows us a complete journey of an AIDS sufferer til death, this film instead chooses to highlight how different people react to a disease differently. It also highlights how much of a joke the US health system is, particularly in how they addressed AIDS - other countries were putting out drugs which were effective and easier to access; whereas the US would put a harmful product out as a reaction to public need without proper analysis whilst also limiting access. When the film ended I wanted to see more of Ron Woodruff's story or at least a photo of what he looked like.\r It's a must see film that will surprisingly make you laugh too.",

Now, on some levels it was a good scary live right movie or you will die. Good stuff; BUT, now it had almost nothing to do with the real AIDS campaign. Sure, they made sure to drop a few key words to wet ones appetite, BUT, it still sent the following false messages: a.) Some big things aren't about money. b.) Everything IS about money. c.) Aids was a big deal in places other than San Francisco. d.) People can have heart attacks and walk out of a hospital 30 minutes later just fine, (if your matt m. famous movie actor). 4.) An average person can treat legal, law enforcement, and medical folks violently and not be put in jail, or brought up on charges. If I shot a shotgun at a door anywhere, there would be cops there in 3 minutes.  So, what now? On to the good stuff. The acting was marginal and seemed fake and felt like they were reading the script in rehearsal. Am I jealous of what these actors get paid to do this stuff? Your dam right I am.

Though the field is very competitive this year in the best actor category he certainly deserves an Oscar nomination and, possibly, a win.\r McConaughney plays Ron Woodruff, the true story of a womanizing, dope taking electrician cowboy who was diagnosed with AIDS in 1985 and given 30 days to live. After a few rough days he accepts the diagnosis but does not accept the 30 day sentence. He takes AZT through underground channels as it is not approved by the FDA and is only available in a patient experiment. He quickly finds out how toxic it is, killing most people who are taking it, and does research finding other drugs, though illegal in the USA, are available in Mexico. Being a hustler he starts a club which costs $400 to join and gives people the drugs for free.\r As most people thought at that time, his friends, and the men he worked with, thought of AIDS as a 'gay disease' and quickly finds himself in fights and being ostracized. Collapsing one day he is rushed to the hospital where he shares a room with Rayon (Jared Leto) a transsexual with AIDS and enough sass to beat, and take his money, in a game of cards with Ron. When the latter starts his club and needs customers he and Rayon become partners developing a constant bickering repartee that also brings great empathy to both. There is no looking away from Jared Leto's performance, especially a scene when he visits his father, who brings across the sass he uses as a defense and the hurt he finds as a transsexual. At this point there is no reason he shouldn't get an Oscar nomination and if he wins it will be deserved just as McConaughey will have earned his.\r The films shows all the problems that people with AIDS faced, not only the discrimination but with the FDA and medical profession working against them. Ron travels all over the world to get the needed drugs and he is faced with all sorts of problems from the government and the Boards of hospitals. He eventually goes to court in San Francisco to fight for his right to take drugs that aren't approved in the USA for, mainly, financial reasons.\r Ron gets involved with a doctor, Eve Saks, played by Jennifer Garner who does a great job but really isn't necessary to/for the movie. Denis O'Hare as her boss Dr. Sevard, Griffin Dunne as an American doctor working in Mexico along with all the supporting actors give excellent support.\r The director, Jean-Marc Vallee, and the screenwriters Craig Borton and Melissa Wallack, in telling the story of two polar opposite men, don't hesitate in telling, and showing, how the world of AIDS was in the 1980s.\r Both Matthew McConaughhey and Jared Leto give full portraits of two completely different people who come together to help each other to live and wind up respecting each others role in life.\r \"Dallas Players Club\" is a must see film not only for the two main performances but for the history of the beginning of an illness that was discriminated against by the government, medical profession and the public and is still killing people today!",

Suddenly an outcast among his heterosexual friends, Woodroof reluctantly warms to a new community  particularly a drug-addicted transsexual named Rayon who becomes his business partner. Rayon is played by an earnestly committed Jared Leto who nevertheless comes off as a theatrical drag queen cliche. They run the buyers club together out of a cheap motel, the unlikeliest pair of Bonnie and Clyde renegades yet. Quebec filmmaker Jean-Marc Vallee (\"The Young Victoria\") directs \"Dallas Buyers Club\" with a loose naturalism, seedy environs and lively humour that prevents the film from becoming over-sentimentalized. It's a true story long in the making (screenplay by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack) based on Woodroof's remarkable late life. But what \"Dallas Buyers Club\" is, ultimately, is the apotheosis of another transformation: McConaughey's great U-turn. A few years after sinking into rote romantic comedies, \"Dallas Buyers Club\" tops an astonishing streak for the 43-year-old that has included \"Mud,\"  Bernie\". He lost more than 40 pounds for the role (Leto, too, is startlingly thin), and appears so gaunt as to wipe away any memory of his rosier, more superficial performances. Extreme weight loss, too, can be a superficial ploy, but McConaughey inhabits the clamouring, clawing Woodroof, whose zest for life (which McConaughey has always exuded) flourishes with the meaning of a moral cause. He stomps down hospital hallways in cowboy boots, a foul-mouthed champion against the system, spouting obscenities in a Texas drawl. In one late scene that could be either Woodroof or McConaughey, he looks in the mirror, and smiles.",

Whether in a strong supporting role (e.g. \"Bernie\"), a memorable turn as a key character (\"Mud\") or carrying the whole film as he does here, he's just been riveting and real. Of course his physical transformation is amazing, but I have to note that he's also one of very few actors who can convincingly portray someone who is \"impaired\" (drunk or whatever). As for the rest of the film, it's basically a medically themed docudrama, on the order of \"Lorenzo's Oil.\" It is interesting and worthwhile to recall how screwed up so many things were as people learned gradually about the AIDS crisis. But McConaughey's performance is stunning.",

He is straight, and homophobic, and when he first learns he has contracted the disease he sets off to Mexico to get medication that is not available in the U.S.  I think at first his intention was to make money selling the drugs in the U.S., but when he meets the gay people in the same predicament as he is he becomes compassionate and comes to the realization that gay people are the same as any other people.  Its a movie about tolerance, acceptance, and the fact that our FDA is more concerned with profit than helping people recover.  McConaughey lost a lot of weight for the role and gives a great performance.  Jared Leto is also in top form as a transsexual who partners with Ron to sell the drugs to the gay community.

The odds are very rosy and clearly he is the front-runner now, the only weighty competitor is his THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013) co-star DiCaprio, whose overdue condition may facilitate him to snatch the highest kudos.\r DALLAS BUYERS CLUB is a dark horse in the BEST PICTURE race and altogether it picked up 6 nominations, apart from BEST LEADING ACTOR, Jared Leto is also having BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR trophy in his bag. Both men’s weigh-lost exploits are purely meritorious for the sake of taking “acting” with full-blooded dedication, which usually works every time, say Daniel Day-Lewis in MY LEFT FOOT (1989, 8/10), or Tom Hanks in PHILADELPHIA (1993), right, the film is also about AIDS, but Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) is an out-and-out straight man, a dissolute rodeo actually, who is as parochial as his working-class peers, homophobic, ribald and unlikeable, squandering his life immoderately without repentance.\r So, when HIV resides inside his body, as if the almighty God generously give Ron a chance to redeem his meaningless life, it is a customary one man’s fight against the venal DEA, the monopolized pharmaceutical enterprise and the collusive hospital MDs, but there is a missing point, like many biographical narratives, all the achievement comes rather easily in a way that we audiences never comprehend what makes the protagonist “the chosen one”, as for Ron, it is his macho heterosexuality distinguishes himself from the massive homosexual patients, thus the clash and metamorphosis is very theatrical, but how does he manage to be the pioneer in the business of illegal medicines deserves more detailed dissection.\r Director Jean-Marc Vallée (C.R.A.Z.Y. 2005, 8/10) is not a novice in dealing with gay-themed feature, although DALLAS BUYERS CLUB is more of an assigned job for him, a light touch comes effectively when he wields the rodeo clown metaphor to manifest Ron’s inner fear, surreptitious and hallucinating. The make-up team is quite praiseworthy too with so many damaged goods to take care of, the impact is authentically appalling.\r From denial to acceptance, McConaughey unleashes an energetic personification with electrifying panache, self-destructive, uplifting and utter poignant, Ron is not a likable person, but in the end of the day, he becomes a better man, an unorthodox hero. Leto, on the other hand, sets an immaculate epitome of a woman’s soul trapped in a man’s body, his most emotive scene is the only time he wears a baggy man’s suit to ask help from his estranged father, awkward and uncomfortable, his vulnerability is all over the place. Jennifer Garner, as the good side of the hospital doctors, is almost characterless and generic, a major disappointment in the storyline, her patronizing poise is perpetually obtrusive, it is a character should not occupy so much of her screen time, we would love see more of Leto instead.\r It is never a winning battle for Ron, the obstacles are too redoubtable to conquer and Ron doesn’t have the time either, we might wallow in the staged success, but the reality tells us it is a tough one to hem in the lucrative pharmaceutics within a modulated system, the “life first” rule certainly is easier said than done.",

In ospedale gli danno trenta giorni e una medicina che lo fa stare peggio: Ron decide di reagire, va in Messico alla ricerca di una cura alternativa e, quando la trova, mette su un’importazione parallela (nonché illegale) per distribuirla ad altri nelle sue condizioni attraverso il club di cui al titolo, ingegnosa trovata per aggirare il divieto di vendita diretta. Ad aiutarlo c’è soprattutto il travestito Rayon, che gli allarga a dismisura la clientela, ma presto arriva il contrasto con la rigidità della medicina ufficiale e con le case farmaceutiche: una battaglia persa, ma, prima di morire ben sette anni dopo rispetto a quando gli era stato pronosticato, Ron riuscirà a ottenere, almeno in parte, ragione. E’ curioso che, anche adesso che la malattia è stata culturalmente metabolizzata, i film sull’AIDS continuino a essere assai rari: l’argomento sembra restare tabù e anche questa sceneggiatura di Craig Borten e Melisa Wallack ha fatto una gran fatica a venire alla luce. Il progetto, nato quando Woodroof era ancora vivo, è passato per tante mani ed è stato finalmente realizzato solo grazie al contributo di McConaughey e al contenimento dei costi: solo venticinque giorni di riprese (se non altro, i due protagonisti hanno così evitato di morire d’inedia) e attrezzature ridotte al minimo. Con queste ultime, il canadese Vallée firma un dramma classico in cui si narra la parabola di redenzione di un uomo ignobile che ha il coraggio di sfidare il destino e i mulini a vento (ovvero Big Pharma), superando al contempo i propri pregiudizi mentre mette in mostra un fino a quel momento sopito spirito imprenditoriale. Come si nota, tutta una serie di classici temi del cinema statunitense che vengono però raccontati con il piede ben piantato sul pedale del freno: i patetismi sono banditi in favore di uno sguardo molto naturalistico (magari un po’ aiutato dalla carenza di mezzi) che sembra ispirarsi a certe opere di Cassavetes. Il Texas che ne esce è un postaccio, dove lo squallore degli ambienti si somma alle ristrettezze mentali di chi ci vive senza alcun desiderio di allargare l’orizzonte: solo la malattia arriva a portare un sconvolgimento tale da far cadere le barriere, ma il prezzo è venire esclusi senza pietà dal proprio ambiente. Proprio per la capacità di narrare tale sconvolgimento, la prima parte del film si rivela più interessante della seconda, dove hanno il sopravvento le disavventure del protagonista con la DEA e con la giustizia del suo Paese diminuendo in qualche modo l’intensità della pellicola anche se l’impostazione visiva rimane coerente: si veda il tristissimo ristorante in cui Ron cena con la dottoressa Saks (Jennifer Garner), l’unica esponente della medicina ‘ufficiale’ che si degni di dargli ascolto. E’ probabile che gli dia ascolto anche perché, sotto i baffoni e dietro l’aspetto pelle e ossa ottenuto perdendo circa venti chili, c’è il fascino di Matthew McConaughey, la cui prova d’attore, con incluso tour de force fisico, è il vero valore aggiunto di ‘Dallas buyers club’ che, grazie a lui, passa da lavoro discreto a pellicola da vedere: l’immedesimazione è sia fisica sia psicologica per una recitazione che, come il film, riesce a trasmettere la carica emotiva pur sforzandosi di non mostrarla in modo palese. Accanto a lui, gli altri attori danno vita a onesti ruoli di supporto (anche Garner risulta sacrificata e non è particolarmente incisiva) con la sola eccezione di Jared Leto che – dopo una pausa di cinque anni – si toglie una decina di chili per incarnare un/una Rayon molto femminile: una bella prova solo messa un po’ in ombra da quella di McConaughey che magari fa un po’ la figura di quei chitarristi abbonati all’assolo che mettono in secondo piano il resto della band ma, tutto sommato, meriterebbe proprio l’Oscar.",

As he struggles to stay alive, he is forced to use medication that brings him into conflict with the authorities.\r We follow Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) as his previously cavalier lifestyle is brought to a standstill with the knowledge of his disease. His confession of his illness to a friend has an unexpected effect when he is perceived as a homosexual, even though he clearly loathes them. He straightens up and does some research, and when he discusses this with Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), he finds that as long as a treatment is not approved by the FDA, there's no chance he can opt for it, despite its use in other parts of the world. AIDS brings him into contact with Rayon (Jared Leto). His hatred of gays resurfaces. But they are another misunderstood group of people who indulge in their feelings without bringing harm to anyone. Ron is evicted by his landlord and his walls are vandalized. Finally he gives up everything and heads after a rumour in Mexico. On his return he starts the Dallas Buyers Club, and attempts to spread medication not approved by the authorities.\r Somewhere along the way, he changes and looks at life differently. This development is surprising when it happens, and I applauded when he rose to the occasion instead of going down the easy path. Ron becomes a big businessman, travelling between different countries in order to circumvent law in bringing life saving drugs into his own country. His interactions with Dr. Eve (Jennifer Garner) are a source of great insight into the disease and much amusement on the side. We also get to see some of the hidden life and past of Rayon. Ron finally takes FDA to court to avail his right to his own treatment.\r Matthew McConaughey has perhaps delivered the most shining performance of his career. Other than weight loss, which is what most actors go for when a role requires it, apart from weight gain, he created a character who was at once a southern hippy and low life yet had a peculiarly uplifting view of life.\r Jared Leto plays a cross dressing gay man who finds friendship in the reluctant Ron. Together they spend what time they have trying to keep other people suffering from AIDS alive.\r The script succeeded in imparting useful information about the disease and its possible cures and the development of medicine designed to keep the harmful effects of the virus at bay. But it did not achieve this at the expense of entertainment. The film was comical all the way.\r We also get to witness the dirty side of society_ the misconceptions people have about the disease and its patients, and their unforgivable behaviour when they unload their insecurities onto the hapless victims. Also portrayed is the behaviour of straight men towards homosexuals.\r The production design did a remarkable job given that the budget was negligible compared to other great movies nominated for the category of Best Picture. The environment of the 1980s and 1990s Texas, including the cars and dresses,  was convincing. The film succeeded in letting us glimpse into the daily life of that era as well as telling a good story with intriguing characters.\r Dallas Buyers Club is a must watch film because I don't really know any other that has dealt with the subject with this much depth.",

In 1996, McConaughey played Jake Tyler Brigance in Joel Schumacher‘s A Time To Kill. Hailed as the best performance of his career, it seemed like, critically, that was the closest the actor would get to any praise.\r In 2011, McConaughey took the lead in Brad Furman‘s The Lincoln Lawyer, a by-the-number crime/mystery, where, McConaughey was able to flex some of his acting muscles as opposed to abdomen muscles. Since then, in what has been the most sudden and misunderstood acting turn in recent memory, McConaughey has reinvented his career and is continuing to be casted as a serious actor with serious acting skills.\r While the Texan acting inspiration has remolded his career in a time span that puts to shame that of Downey Jr. and Travolta, one of McConaughey‘s unflinching signature acting staples is his bold and proud Texan accent. And while I can’t really imagine how a cowboy like himself was cast in Christopher Nolan‘s upcoming science fiction Interstellar, McConaughey and his accent were surely a match made in heaven for his role as the slowly weathering and dying HIV/AIDS patient Ron Woodruff.\r For Dallas Buyers Club, McConaughey and his accent worked exceptionally well. Quebecois director Jean-Marc Vallee helms McConaughey as Ron Woodruff; a rugged, homophobic, ultra-macho, bull-riding, money throwing,  playboy with no accord to anyone. Woodruff, a money hustling, chance taking electrician juggles his fortune, his luck, his women, and his job to make ends meet and live a somewhat fulfilling life. It isn’t until an unexpected accident at work that leaves Woodruff hospitalized, giving him no choice but to make a difference in his life and the lives of many others.\r Upon learning of his recent HIV positive diagnostics and short thirty day life expectancy time span, Woodruff, reluctant to die, uses his hustling, smooth-talking, greasing ways to secure him a new, untested medicine to prolong the spread of HIV, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved AZT. After consuming an uncontrolled amount of AZT, the only legal drug that was available at the time in the United States, all the while, still abusing his substances, Woodruff has a close encounter with death. Coming to the morbid realization that the ATZ was depleting his longevity, he enlists the help of a disgraced doctor (Griffin Dunne) and together bring unapproved anti-viral treatments to the U.S illegally. What starts off as a simple economic money tapping market venture, Woodruff, along the way, comes to the realization that his efforts to help others, are actually working. Enlisting the help of fellow HID/AIDS victim Rayon (Jared Leto), the two start the Dallas Buyers Club, an alternative treatment centre for paying members that pits Woodruff in a gestating face-to-face with the FDA and other pharmaceutical companies. As the clientele grows thanks to Rayon’s introduction to the biggest HIV/AIDS demographic, homosexuals, Woodruff has a revelation that not only changes his opinion of gays but also is a deep and dark look of sexual discrimination in the south of the U.S in the 1980′s.\r Dallas Buyers Club is a film dependent on the skills of its actors physical and mental performances. Aside from McConaughey‘s drastic forty pound weight loss, supporting actor Jared Leto dropped a hefty amount of weight to play the utterly convincing transsexual Rayon. Veering far away from Christian Bale comparisons in his eerie and grotesque turn as Trevor Reznik in Brad Anderson 2004′s indie The Machinist, the two leads in the Dallas Buyers Club abandon physical spectacle in exchange for allowing their on-screen presence to give a candid, historical accuracy of HIV/AIDS patients, and the brutal struggle they faced against a deadly and unforgiving epidemic in the United States in the 1980′s.\r Dallas Buyers Club is McConaughey’s best role yet. Fierce, trashy and edifying, the actor substitutes humility for profanity, glamour for wretchedness, and the light-hearted for the heavy and unapologetic. Finally, McConaughey joins a club of actors that he should be proud to be a part of.\r Although the year’s lead actor category is going to be a full one at this year’s Academy Awards, the Supporting Actor category will have a  clear winner. Unrecognizable, subtle and submerged into the role, their is no deny or ignoring the raw talent Leto brings to the role of Rayon. His previous efforts as a dedicated method actor, either gaining a large amount of weight or shedding weight with a wink of an eye, Leto‘s dedication to the craft is showcased in Dallas Buyers Club, and will surely be rewarded.",

If you don’t know what that is it means a movie relies on its actors and actresses to carry the plot. Usually this is because the plot is terrible and has no depth whatsoever, but the plot is one of the best things about Dallas Buyers Club. You probably know that it is based on true events and some of the stuff Ron Woodroof got away with is almost unbelievable. And it makes brilliant entertainment. But as I have mentioned this is a performance movie and the strongest thing about it are the performances. Matthew McConaughey is amazing and I think the reason behind it is he has just had what some are calling a McConnaissance, he has had a career change and is now planning to do more serious roles and less crappy rom-coms. Jared Leto I think is just as good, he plays a transvestite. And is not a transvestite in real life. That is a hard thing to pull off. But he does it extremely well and the hair and makeup artists perfectly show his descent into extreme illness. All of the supporting cast are brilliant aswell and compliment the lead cast while staying Oscar worthy, of course they haven’t even been nominated that’s how the Academy works. The only things about Dallas Buyers Club which I didn’t like were that I had no idea who some characters were, they just sort of turned up. And the last shot was slightly clichéd, not the whole ending that was almost perfect. It was just the last shot felt a bit overly philosophical when it wasn’t actually philosophical in any way. However Dallas Buyers Club is a hugely enjoyable and very intelligent movie overall, mainly due to the two leads Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto who practically carry the whole movie.",

Its set the 1980’s, the early days of the AIDS‘Dallas Buyers Club’ was a wonderful film about AIDS stricken activist Ron Woodroof, and his heroic attempts to work around the system to help other AIDS patients get the medication they need. Its set the 1980’s, the early days of the AIDS epidemic; which was a time when the ignorant public shunned those with the disease, the US was divided over how to combat the virus and the FDA made selfish decisions on the way the  drugs were administered. In its truest form, this film was more of a character study about Woodroof, a homophobic, red-neck, electrician; who teams up with Rayon, a transgendered AIDS patient, to help others in the same predicament as him. Though initially for monetary gains, Woodroof, moved by his newfound friend, Rayon, and the plight of the sufferers, eventually puts a side the money and seek to help those with the disease, first-and-foremost. Matthew McConaughey gives the performance of a life time Woodroof; he not only loses an immense amount of weight for the role,, but he gives a truly powerfully performance about a man enlightened after realizing how short life is. Great work. With recent talks about the socialization of health care in America, this topic still somehow feels relevant to our time, and in no way out-dated. With such a smart screenplay, and directed with a strong balance of sincere emotion and witty humor, ‘Dallas Buyers Club’ easily evades the “movie-of-the-month” feel that it could have become. Sometimes heartbreaking, ‘Dallas Buyers Club’ was a largely entertaining movie that moves at a clip, and manages to make you feel-good by its end.",

Despite this hovering cloud of depression, 'Dallas Buyers Club' is an emotional drama, with captivating performances from McConaughey and Leto, both of whom I think will have a share of accolades to go along with their stand-out acting. McConaughey plays spell-bindingly as the homophobic, drug-addled womanizer, nuanced by his disease, and transforms into a more subtle human being. Leto, although, is by far more superb, in terms of acting ability. He portrays a more convincing woman than most women do themselves, something (pardon my sexism) I thought was impossible to achieve.

His journey to overcome this diagnosis is what makes this film so remarkable; his character fights with enormous passion and determination to turn his life around and the lives of thousands of others.

Little is known about the disease, littler known is its treatment, and its latest victim is Ron Woodroof – a blue collar, hustler and straight-up Texas cowboy and he going out swinging hard, creating the Dallas Buyers Club.\r At a time when HIV was poorly understood and research to treat the virus was slow moving, in part by the FDA, diagnosis was a death sentence. With a startlingly low 30 day prognosis, Woodroof is just bullheaded enough attempt to outlive his prognosis, by any means necessary despite the legal ramifications. Based on a true story, Dallas Buyers Clubs tells of Woodroof’s quest for medication, bypassing regulation, by heading straight to Mexico. Along the way he sees a booming market of desperate people, and creates a members-only club with an unlikely business partner Rayon, a trans woman.\r Matthew McConaughey plays the machismo Ron Woodroof and his casting could not be more on point. Who else can play a Texas cowboy than Hollywood’s own leading man? His commitment to the character is obvious due to his physical transformation and withered frame of a deathly ill man.  The role was made for him and that might be the problem – it feels like he is just being Matthew McConaughey with AIDS.\r The real star of the film is the trans business partner Rayon. Jared Leto is pure and true in his portrayal of the trans Rayon, albeit a bit hokey. He is transcendent, there is absolutely not a drop of Leto visible, not for even a fraction of a second. Once Leto’s character is introduced the movie takes a powerful step in the direction of captivating Oscar worthy cinema.\r In less capable hands this story could have easily been sappy, bland, and straight-forward. Its lack of insipidity is thanks in part to the relatively unknown script writers Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack. and director of the film Jean-Marc Vallée. In the end it is a human interest piece masked as a drama and worthy of your time and viewership.\r More reviews of recent releases can be found at our website.",

McConaughey and Jared Leto deserved the accolades that they received as they were both amazing. Leto was especially great and he is settling into being quite the character actor.\r The Bad: A little overrated as I don't feel that the film itself deserved a Best Picture nomination. It relies almost TOO much on McConaughey and drags on at times. It almost feels like there wasn't quite enough source material to make a two hour film.",

Dallas Buyers club is incredibly well acted by all its cast members. But the ones who shine the most are Matthew McConaughey who plays a broke rodeo cowboy named Ron who is suffering from AIDS and Jared Leto who plays a transgender named Rayon who is also suffering from AIDS. Together they start a club in which people can join and get special drugs that can help slow down AIDS and other issues that people have. This club is called the Dallas Buyers Club, hence the name of this movie. This movie tells the true story of Ron Woodroof and the club that he starts. This movie is fantastic! I give it a 9/10",

Directed by Jean-Marc Vallée, the film has screenplay by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, with Matthew McConaughey, Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner in the lead roles.The recipe for success of this film begins with the story: it is a true story based on people who really existed and who fought to humanize the lives of AIDS patients, a disease with no cure but more understood today. However, McConaughey's Woodroof is not a hero, is far from it. It begins to be a hateful and prejudiced character, and only at the end we see how his fight changed the way he thinks. In any case, this is definitely the consecration of work of this actor, who has achieved an outstanding performance, as well as Leto, whose sensitivity and fight against social prejudices made him a symbol of a certain type of AIDS patients. Moreover, both actors were awarded the Oscar for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. A prize, I think, more than deserved. The film has a good photograph, visual and sound effects do their role, as well as the soundtrack, which is not surprising.There are several notable films about AIDS universe, homosexuality and drugs. In fact, most of the films that address one of these issues end up invariably by address or touch the other two. \"Philadelphia\" is a paradigmatic example. This is a film with feelings but tries not to be cheesy with it, and not focus a lot on advocacy, flags or any kind of argument. Seen on this light, this film does not seem to be biased, which is very positive and difficult to achieve when you make a movie around socially divisive issues.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThis is a very gritty and quite bleak film - one that doesn't gloss over the main issues of the perceptions of HIV/AIDS and homophobia in the time its set in (the mid to late 1980s). Ron comes across as loud, brash and macho - a strong willed son of a what-not, you get the idea(!). Its interesting to follow his story, to see how restrictive treatment was and the way the doctors etc. treated him, as much as (if not moreso than) his reaction to and coming to terms with his then terminal diagnosis. I found this to be an engrossing watch - it covers some difficult subjects and I didn't feel it glossed over the issues, glamorised anything or was especially 'Hollywood', which is good. Its a challenging watch, thats for sure but it does pretty well at painting a bleak picture of how things were back then. It shows how marginalised and desperate those who had been given the death sentence diagnosis of HIV were, with different people taking it differently but there being a pretty general condemnation at how the US government were dealing with medicating it and allowing (or not allowing) certain drugs, which were seen to potentially increase life longevity, to be legally obtained.I noticed at times that to add to the feeling of isolation and degrading health, sheer desperation even, a loud ringing noise was emitted, after all background noise fades away - that gives a strong sense of claustrophobia and is quite disorientating. I think this film is quite hard hitting and I found myself almost wondering why it was so engrossing, in as much as Ron comes across as what you'd think on the outset to be quite a detestable figure - a loud mouthed, homophobic bully, so it would seem. However, I think the situation he finds himself in and his community maybe in part excuses it, or certainly its hard not to have some level of sympathy for someone who was in his situation. Although I did somewhat question the feasibility of how his case developed and eventually concluded, obviously with it being based on a true story I can't say its by no means realistic but I think it was the fact that after every so many scenes, white text on black background with the day number appeared (ie. representating however many days after Rons intitial HIV diagnosis, being originally given 30 days to live) and as it increased, I suppose I couldn't help but wonder where it was headed, when the inevitable would happen, especially considering his devil-may-care attitude at times. Having said that, there is an admirable side to what Ron did, going to great lengths, travelling outside the US to track down potential life saving drugs but how he afforded this and some of the ins and outs, im not entirely sure. I suppose it doesn't entirely matter. Ron, Tucker and Eve were the most memorable characters - Tucker and Ron getting into numerous boyish scuffles. Eve I thought was a particularly interesting character, she sort of offsets the other characters in being - well for one caring, plus non-judgemental. She's the one character that goes at lengths to stick up for the HIV positive patients and tries to reach out to help them and it shows.I thought the performances were good and the film overall is pretty engrossing and somewhat compelling even - a true story of its time, well told.Yes I'd recommend this film. Its quite gritty and bleak but it features good performances and I felt it was quite engrossing in general - its based on a true story and I feel its an important depiction to make, as its a story of its time and I felt it was a well made film in general. It won't suit everyone of course, due to the very strong language and drug and sex scenes but otherwise its worth a watch.",
