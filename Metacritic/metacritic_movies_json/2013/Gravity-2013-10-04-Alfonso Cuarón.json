But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone - tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth - and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.\u2026 Expand",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "A stunning space saga that takes off for new technical frontiers without leaving its humanity behind.",
        "For all its stunning exteriors, it's really concerned with emotional interiors, and it goes about exploring them with simplicity and directness.",
        "Thanks to Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s prodigious gifts, Gravity succeeds simultaneously as a simple classic shipwreck narrative (albeit at zero-gravity), and as an utterly breathtaking restoration of size and occasion to the movies themselves.",
        "In one form or another, motion pictures have been with us since the middle of the 19th century, but there's never been one like Gravity. What's new in Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's 3-D space adventure is the nature of the motion. It's as if the movie medium had been set free to dance in a bedazzling zero-gravity dream sequence.",
        "The telling of this simple tale of survival required cutting-edge technology, but we don't notice the bells and whistles: They're on hand to immerse us in an unforgettable personal story.",
        "Pop quiz, hotshot: you\u2019re cut loose 375 miles above the Earth, oxygen is running out, communication is lost, catastrophic satellite debris is heading your way and you have no hope of rescue. What do you do? What do you do? The answer is the film of the year.",
        "Gravity is out of this world. Words can do little to convey the visual astonishment this space opera creates. It is a film whose impact must be experienced in 3-D on a theatrical screen to be fully understood.",
        "A wildly suspenseful zero-g tale of survival 350 miles beyond the ozone layer, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's space saga is emotionally jolting - and physically jolting, too.",
        "Sandra Bullock, in the performance of a lifetime, spends most of this wondrous wallop of a movie lost in space, alone where no one can hear her scream.",
        "Gravity, it turns out, is a great film, a technical and storytelling masterpiece that is buoyed by stunning visuals and which functions both as a ripping, tension-filled yarn and as a profound and life-affirming work of art.",
        "Gravity, a weightless ballet and a cold-sweat nightmare, intimates mystery and profundity, with that mixture of beauty and terror that the Romantics called the sublime.",
        "See Gravity in theaters, because on television something will be lost. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n has made a rare film whose mood, soul and profundity is bound up with its images. To see such images diminished would be to see a lesser film, perhaps even a pointless one.",
        "Gravity isn't just a movie; it's almost transformative, and the visceral element is enhanced by the 3-D.",
        "Compared by some to \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u2019\u2019 Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s relatively intimate space epic is equally groundbreaking in the spectacular way it depicts space.",
        "A thrill ride with a brain.",
        "You can\u2019t exactly call Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Gravity the best film of its kind, because it has no kind: It stands alone as an extraordinary balance of 3-D effects, heroes-in-jeopardy storytelling and emotional depth.",
        "It is a remarkable achievement.",
        "The miracle of the movie is the way that director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, using special effects and 3-D with a nearly poetic simplicity and command, places the audience right up there in space along with them.",
        "Gravity isn\u2019t as ambitious as \u201c2001,\u201d but then, what is? It is, however, absolutely a worthy successor, a masterpiece of hard science fiction, and the movie to beat at this point for next year\u2019s cinematography and visual effects Oscars.",
        "Gravity is a game-changer like \"Avatar\" in the realm of digital 3-D special effects, inventing trickeries to be applied by future filmmakers and possibly never improved upon. Yet its spirit is closer to Avatar's smarter descendants, \"Hugo\" and \"Life of Pi,\" with the gimmicks embellishing, not driving, the material. Less Cameron, more Kubrick.",
        "The movie is as cornball as all get-out and \u2014 once you discern the narrative arc \u2014 as predictable. But then there\u2019s the part that\u2019s \u2014 as we serious cinephiles like to say \u2014 infuckingcredible.",
        "Gravity is harrowing and comforting, intimate and glorious, the kind of movie that makes you feel more connected to the world rather than less.",
        "Gravity shows us the glory of cinema\u2019s future. It thrills on so many levels. And because Cuar\u202a\u00f3n is a movie visionary of the highest order, you truly can\u2019t beat the view.",
        "A science-fiction thriller of rare and diamond-hard brilliance.",
        "At once the most realistic and beautifully choreographed film ever set in space, Gravity is a thrillingly realized survival story spiked with interludes of breath-catching tension and startling surprise.",
        "The director\u2019s long-overdue follow-up to \u201cChildren of Men\u201d is at once a nervy experiment in blockbuster minimalism and a film of robust movie-movie thrills, restoring a sense of wonder, terror and possibility to the bigscreen.",
        "Gravity is about as visceral an experience as you can have in a cinema, it\u2019s a technical marvel, and it\u2019s a blockbuster with heart and soul in spades.",
        "The fact that Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s film strives to be something more than thoroughly harrowing \u2014 no small feat in and of itself \u2014 solidifies its existence as a marvel of not just technical craft but sheer imagination as well",
        "Gravity lets you visit space without sugarcoating its dangers. It's a brilliant portrait of technology gone wrong that uses it just right.",
        "While the tension never lets up for a second, how you respond to the boundary-fudging and wildly improbable ending of Gravity \u2013 meaning both how it makes you feel and how you interpret it \u2013 will determine whether you think the movie is a genuine pop masterpiece or a canny artifice. Maybe there\u2019s no difference.",
        "Cuaron and his son Jonas have felt the need not just to come up with ways to keep the characters talking \u2014 there's even a mildly sneery reference to NPR at one point \u2014 but to brush in backstory and motivation, quite as if the peril of being isolated in space with a limited supply of oxygen weren't sufficient rationale for the characters' actions.",
        "For all of Mr. Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s formal wizardry and pictorial grandeur, he is a humanist at heart.",
        "The film uses the cutting edge of technology to take viewers to the far reaches of the human experience, but also to create a sense of empathy, of investing in the life of another person. It\u2019s a remarkably complex film, but an admirably simple one, too.",
        "Gravity is a major filmmaking accomplishment, no doubt, although it would have been interesting to see how it might have played sans dialogue. Unthinkable to Hollywood, sure, but still \u2026 Kowalski and Stone\u2019s backstories and banter are, in the end, secondary to the film\u2019s jaw-dropping visuals.",
        "This is one of the most stunning visual treats of the year and one of the most unforgettable thrill rides in recent memory.",
        "The movie\u2019s an astonishingly detailed, visually painstaking state-of-the-art production that advances what the cinema can show us\u2014even as the human story at its center feels a little thin after a while.",
        "Gravity is a celebration of the primal pleasure of movies: It shows you things you\u2019ve never seen before, transports you out of the theater and out of your head, tricks you into believing what\u2019s happening on the screen is happening to you.",
        "Even as it looks to the heavens, Gravity is bound to earth, where the beauty is in the details.",
        "It's a nerve-wracking visual experience of unusual and paradoxical delicacy. And if your stomach can take it, it's truly something to see.",
        "Bullock and Clooney make their peril our peril in this absolutely gorgeous, moving and sometimes exultant reminder that the real terrors of space are scary enough, without invented bug-eyed monsters thrown in.",
        "Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's triumph is an invigoratingly clean, elegant display of action choreography, a La R\u00e9gion Centrale you can still take grandma to see.",
        "I almost wish Cuar\u00f3n had cast nonactors, or unknown actors, in the lead roles. It\u2019s jarring having movie stars work up their Hollywood histrionics against such a glorious backdrop. None of these arguments should dissuade you from seeing Gravity, if only because what\u2019s good about it is so much better than what\u2019s bad. Visually, if not imaginatively, it sends you soaring.",
        "If nothing else, Gravity makes the case for throwing immense resources at true visionaries; the blockbuster craftsman as adventurer, Cuar\u00f3n expertly blends the epic with the intimate. For every stunning 3-D setpiece involving a dangerous hailstorm of metallic debris, there\u2019s a moment of small tenderness.",
        "This is not to say that Gravity is a masterpiece: Unlike Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s extraordinary \"Children of Men\", it doesn\u2019t quite pull off its ambitious effort to combine formal inventiveness, heart-pounding action, and intimate human storytelling. But it succeeds thrillingly at the first two of those categories, and only misses the mark on the last because it tries a little too hard \u2014 which is certainly a welcome respite from the countless sci-fi thrillers that privilege the human story not at all.",
        "Cuar\u00f3n, a magician who brought personality to the Harry Potter series, is after pure, near-experimental spectacle.",
        "This isn\u2019t just the best-looking film of the year, it\u2019s one of the most awe-inspiring achievements in the history of special-effects cinema. So it\u2019s a shame that \u2013 as is so often the case with groundbreaking effects movies \u2013 the emotional content can\u2019t quite match up to the visual.",
        "The film thrums with an ongoing existential dread. And yet, tellingly, Cuaron's film contains a top-note of compassion that strays at times towards outright sentimentality.",
        "Accept Gravity as pure, popcorn-munching show business fun and nothing else, and you won\u2019t go away disappointed."

This movie was shot as a simple survival story in space...  but I connected to it even more at a much deeper level.  The way that the cinematography was shot, I felt I was in space floating with Sandra Bullock's character, Dr. Ryan Stone... that was a technical achievement in itself...  But  I was also able to feel what it was like to be in the mind of her character.  I feared with her, struggled to survive with her, felt the hopelessness of life and accepted death with her, and then, found air, found new life, and was born again with her.  Sandra Bullock has put on an Oscar worthy performance, and it sure did help with Alfonso Cuaron being at the helm to guide this film.  What a genius.  It's been awhile since I've been deeply absorbed into the thoughts and feelings of a character on screen.  This movie was truly a journey and an experience into the mind and soul of Dr. Ryan Stone's character.  Wow, such an amazing film.  An unforgettable experience!

The story was extremely repetitive, very simple, and somewhat boring. Along with the underachieving plot, I thought that Clooney's acting was uninspired and lazy, Bullock over-acted to the point that she got very annoying and unconvincing, there was minimal character development, and I did not feel any sympathy for the characters.

That is why I can only give it a 5, maybe a 5.5 due to the fact that they managed to make it with only two and a half actors.The movie is not bad, it's just not very interesting and very cliche in the details of the plot. I would give it a 7 or 8 if they removed all the psychological crap you see in teenage movies about \"being unable to move on\".",

Special effects were amazing, the film was an absolute technological marvel on par with Avatar and Lord of the Rings. The action and all aspects of this film were very artistic and beautiful. The acting was hard to judge because of the space helmets, but the voice acting that you could hear through the com was realistic and helped add to the suspense and emotions of the film. The problem with this film is that you don't really care about the characters. They seem like amazing people walking around in space, and you get to know a little bit about their home lives, but it just wasn't enough. Really the story was all premise, which I find rather boring and aggravating in a film. 2 people floating around above the earth trying to get back home. That really is all there is to the story, so it gets pretty boring. Add to that the complete lack of an interesting compelling script, and you get a movie the was pretty pointless. If all you need is good visuals, then you will love this film, if you need something a bit more sophisticated, then you will hate it. I would have rated this film higher for the visuals and technology, but seeing as it is already extremely overrated I will just give it a zero.",

The effects of course are amazing and the cinematography, I will say, is phenomonal... everything from the pre-production to the filming to the post must have been mind numbing for the filmmakers, but to me, a movie has to have the following to be good;\r1. characters you care about... not in this one.\rStarting the film in space was not smart. I don't know if they were trying to set some sort of record of having the smallest cast, which it already doesn't, if you've seen 'Buried' you will know what I am talking about. Well maybe there were 2 people in that I'm not sure. Anyways, you never really felt for the main characters... you don't care if these people go off into space... I mean I guess unless you care about Sandra Bullock and George Clooney personally...\r2. Morals. Yes, it did have a very obvious moral; never give up. But it didn't change my outlook on anything really... Just a simple pretty basic message.\r3. a great story with a creative way of telling it, along with brilliant individual scenes. You should be able to leave the theater asking your fellow movie goers which part they liked best. In this you can say \"when she's breathing a lot\" or \"when she almost dies by the inconvenient debris which never ever happens but for some reason has happened to 3 different shuttles in the past hour\"\r4. Music that connects you with the characters, and with the moment, and how you should be feeling... you need a GREAT composer if you want a great movie.\r I'm tired of all these films coming out that are so critically acclaimed, but for what? Where are the films where you leave the theater just thinking about it over and over, where the film really sticks with you? Where are the films that you can leave thinking to yourself, \"wow, that will be a classic?\" I mean maybe in past generations, all the films they saw they just said \"eh\" and now we think they are classics... but if not then I'm just disappointed. Maybe I'm not as deep of a thinker as the critics, but all I can say about this film is it probably took a very very long time to get these special effects down... but honestly... I've seen more visually stunning things at OMSI, and Disneyland, and most rides at Universal Studios. I don't know why people are saying this is a once in a generation movie... It is certainly not one I will remember too well.",

I expected something more. The script is simple: in the near future, a severe blast causes a chain reaction destroying most orbiting satellites and launching a shower of space debris compromising the survival of a team of American astronauts who were repairing the Hubble Telescope. It's a plot that works but has serious credibility problems based on the great improbability of all our satellites being destroyed at the same time. It also totally ignores some science issues such as the abundance of space junk in Earth's orbit and has a plot hole that rubs the absurd: how the astronauts were able to listen to dogs in China if they were not even able to communicate with the own base in Houston? Sandra Bullock is the main character, in the role of a scientist who was selected for that mission by being an expert on the subject. The actress is good and her quality is unquestionable but I think her character wasn't well thought. Despite being a rookie in space and showing little training, her character is able to decently decouple herself in a ISS shuttle and in a Chinese one, something her training would probably never have prepared her for not being strictly necessary to her mission. There is a latent contradiction here, and it does not to be a physical or a genius to realize that and to detect others in the film. George Clooney is a good supporting actor but sometimes his posture, somewhat childish and relaxed, prevented me from actually feeling any tension, not to mention that the way he dies is absolutely clich\u00e9. The direction of Alfonso Cuaron works reasonably, and I think I realized some scenes that intentionally copy great films of the past in order to to honor them. This is beautiful and symbolic. The end of the film also seems loaded with symbolism.The technical issue, however, is beyond reproach. CGI is absolutely grand and the images of our planet are breathtaking. I liked cinematography and soundtrack, discrete but competent. The way they put the actors floating weightless also seems incredible and realistic, just like the ships, tools, space suits and even the floating debris. Visually, the film is powerful and realistic but it's not the first time I say this: it's not a CGI storm that makes a good movie. The script has to be good. And the fact is that the script of this film, although it works, has a lot of holes, errors, absurd moments and contradictions. No matter how improbable is the situation the movie shows, the audience has to feel that it's real and it's happening. And I could not feel it here.",

The 2013 motion picture directed by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n and written by the director and his son Jon\u00e1s cuar\u00f2n with music by upcoming British composer Steven Price and cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki. The story centres around two main characters which are Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt kowalski (George Clooney) while they are in space putting in the new hobble scope which was designed by Ryan Stone. While on their mission a Russian satellite breaks down and the debris hits their craft and form then it is a survival journey where Ryan Stone Matt Kowalski must try and survive in space. This is one of the bet motion pictures in history and especially if you watched it in IMAX 3D because the 3D was superb and the visual effects were amazing and that's why it won the Oscar for best visual effects. They social score is out of this world and gives you a sense isolation. The cinematography was the best I have ever seen because the first 12 minutes of this film is just one long take which is breath taking. The acting all round is good and the backstory to each character is good. George Clooneys whitty humour and Sandra Bullocks insecurity was brilliant. The film is an experience of a life time. This film definitely gets a 10/10 for me.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nOkay, so, obviously, there are a lot of people that did not like the movie. While they're entitled to their own opinions, I think the biggest reason for their disappointment are these two reasons: the plot, and the actual \"science\" of the film\r First, we'll start off with the plot. Really, the entire basis of the plot is that, during a space walk, a large debris field is created that threatens the lives of all the people that are on the United Sates' Explorer (a rocket). That's it. But, if you look a little deeper, you'll see that there's more to it than that. You see, the story is really character driven. You're supposed to care for Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney). The story is entirely about Stone. It is about her learning to live life instead of just \"driving,\" or in other words, just living. After she lost her daughter, she never fully coped. In fact, she just went as life went. Job, space, whatever. They were just things to her. Nothing was really important other than her job. But when she is in space, her problems become clearer, and she is able to deal with them. My favorite part of the movie is actually when, after being untethered from her companion, she falls asleep in the fetal position. In this scene, the tether is seen in the background, giving the appearance of a fetus; it's symbolism of her being reborn. Now, to me, there were really two separate plots, the first, the debris cloud, was very weak; however, the second, the story of her coming to grips with her daughter's death, was very strong. In fact, it is the strongest part of the film, and it is the reason that critics fell in love with it. I think that the people who don't like the movie either missed this plot, or they could not connect with it. I was someone who could connect with it, and very easily so.\r Now, the second complaint about the movie is the \"science\" part of it. Firstly, there are many errors that were made mostly with the physics. Actually, the whole premise of the space debris cloud is impossible. The locations of the Chinese and Russian stations are also changed to match the plot. What I don't understand about this complaint is the fact that this movie is \"science fiction.\" Because it is fiction, as a movie writer, they changed facts. Actually, the definition of science fiction means that it is based off of a future (unless it is in the present) that has imagined scientific advancements and technologies. Now, technically speaking, a movie can change the facts of life. If someone wanted to make a movie where the was absolutely no gravity on earth, they could do that. If they wanted to make a movie where water was really soda, they could do that as well. Just because they made many changes from actual reality does not make this a bad film. Sure, you can easily spot what they got wrong, but if you do that, you'll miss all of the things that they got right!\r Now, for my actual review. This movie is beautiful. I mean, it contains some of the most beautiful images ever captured on film. Earth viewed by from space is a stunning back drop. Actually, space itself is beautiful in this movie. However, what I thought they did very well was that they took something beautiful (the stillness and awe inspiring aspects of earth and space) and they showed us that it is equally as dangerous as it is beautiful. That, despite us being able to go to space, with out the things we've created, there is no possible way to stay alive there. That it is dangerous. That it is an endless wall of black, and that when untethered, we will float endlessly to our deaths in it.\r Other than the beauty, what I thought was best about this movie was the drama. Sure, the special effects are great, but the depth of the characters were amazing. We only got to see the shell of Ryan Stone until the very end of the movie. The biggest thing that stuck out to me was that by the end, she still didn't care whether she lived or died. But the reasons for that changed. She didn't care because she knew she was trying, and she knew that she was fighting, and because of those two reasons, she knew that she was living. She'd finally dealt with her problems and she was at ease. She knew that it didn't matter anymore because her life had been well lived: she had had a daughter, she had gone to space, she had survived for as long as she had, and if she died, at least she'd be doing it while feeling alive.\r So, at the end of the movie, when she finally takes her last steps, she knows that she made it. That she gets a second chance to live her life. That she's no longer going to be \"just riding.\" And that is her greatest triumph as she takes her first steps on earth. The promise of her new life that could have only been achieved by going through the travesty of surviving her ordeal in space. And those final steps, paired with the emotional score, are the most triumphant final steps taken from any movie. And if you can see that, you'll enjoy it as well.",

It's obvious that the majority of the film's $105,000,000 budget went on them as they are pure state-of-the-art and probably the best I've seen in a film to date; they create an amazing atmosphere (no pun intended) and I've never seen the Earth look so gorgeous. Secondly, the acting. The (more or less) two man cast brings a sense of loneliness and makes the vast spacescape look even bigger. Bullock and Clooney are perfect choices for the parts and they do their job well with Bullock switching it up a little with gender roles. Thirdly; the cinematography. The camera angles are absolutely brilliant and they really give the film a realistic feel. Fourthly; the realism. The film keeps very close to realism when it comes to the physics; a notable part would be the soundless destruction of the space stations. The films 90 minute run-time may seem quite short for a sci-fi thriller but this serves plenty and leaves a lasting effect on the viewer. I'd recommend Gravity for anyone; you don't have to be a sci-fi movie buff to enjoy this visual masterpiece. I have hardly any criticisms apart from the films storyline didn't quite go in my favour but that doesn't douse its brilliance. All I can say now is, See you at the Academy Awards Gravity!",

The sound effects on the other hand were dazzling, when something bad was happening, it was clear through the absolutely superb sound design. One of the most impressive things about this movie is the way it was shot, Alfonso Cuaron is known for his extra-long takes which play right into the ballpark of Gravity. Throughout the entire movie, the shots that lingered for a while, never felt like they had overstayed there welcome, every shot had a purpose and intrigued a certain emotion. All in all, this was an exceptional movie that is worth anyone's time (best to watch in 3D)!\r I give this movie an 8.5!",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nGrowing up in Flower Mound, Texas, I quickly discovered that there was very little to do for a teenager without much money. If you weren't hungry for some fast food or in the mood to window shop, you might as well go home and watch television. Thankfully for me, an AMC Movie Theater opened in Highland Village not even 5 minutes away from where I live in 2007. It is very difficult to try to explain just how many afternoons and evenings I have spent there with friends or family seeing the new hit movie. Visiting there at least every other weekend, I must have spent at least $1,000 since it opened. Seven years of the good, the bad, and the ugly, and by now, I might even be considered an unofficial movie critic.\rSo, a couple months ago I heard from some friends and family members about this exciting new film, Gravity. Critics raved calling it the greatest movie of 2013, destined for glory, and certain it would be considered an instant classic for years to come. I was skeptical, but they were right after all, at least about the awards. Just a little while ago, Gravity won Best Cinematography, Best Editing, and Best Director at the 2014 Oscars. By the end of the night Gravity had won seven Oscars, an impressive feat. I never thought that the trailer for some space movie with Bullock and Clooney looked particularly good, but by this point I had to see it, and so I did.\rGravity was one of the most confused and predictable movies I have seen in the last couple of years. The whole idea of the movie for those unfamiliar is that while on a spacewalk, Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) and her team are hit by debris from a Russian satellite that has mysteriously exploded. Unfortunately, Dr. Stone becomes the sole survivor of the impact and must try to get home without help from NASA. This is where things start to get really confusing, as there is almost no explanation as to why no one can help Stone with the establishment of a simple radio communication. But hey, it\u2019s a movie after all so we can look past a basic plot hole. Since the film takes place in the quiet void of space, much of the plot advancement is based entirely off of Stone\u2019s own internal struggle of getting back to earth, and the fear that she might not be able to. However if you were hoping for a main character who is full of life and determined to fight for her life, you\u2019re looking at the wrong movie entirely. Stone apparently has no family or friends and according to her, no one cares if she lives or dies. As if the plot wasn't struggling enough, we now have a main character that doesn\u2019t really want to try to survive and is content to just sit in her spacecraft and wait for the inevitable. Yes, that is actually part of the movie which goes on for about 15 minutes. Earlier I mentioned that not only is the plot confusing, but it\u2019s stupidly predictable. Once you watch the first couple of \u201cclose calls\u201d that Stone has, you realize that that\u2019s the entire basis of the movie. Stone simply cannot perform a single task well, so by the last half of the movie, you can accurately predict how events will play out since you know that not only is the main character an incompetent buffoon, but she\u2019s also the luckiest person in existence. That being said, the visuals were interesting and oddly vibrant for such a drab setting. In the end though, I found Gravity to be emotionally stale, entirely expected, and a characterless excuse for some sort of space adventure. I would recommend avoiding this movie altogether, but if you must see it, borrow it from a friend or watch it on the internet. You\u2019re better off spending $10 on a really tasty sandwich, at least that doesn't come with a side of disappointment.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nAlfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s intense space thriller Gravity chronicles the struggle of two astronauts to return home when their shuttle is damaged beyond repair by an unprecedented cascade of destructive space debris.\r Though undeniably engaging and action-packed, there is an understated atmosphere that comes from the focus on a small cast and their isolation. It\u2019s not pure science-fiction, though fiction allows it to circumnavigate the criticism it has received for scientific inaccuracies. In the absence of any vast treatise on the destiny of humanity, Gravity becomes a contemporary space adventure that is both modern thriller and character drama.\r The term \u2018shot\u2019 is used loosely here, because the real stars are the stunning visual effects, created in London. What the production team have created is a live action film that is almost entirely and inconspicuously computer generated. Our heroes are inserted into the immersing void above a stunning blue pearl, as they navigate speeding debris, collapsing spacecraft and vast leagues of emptiness.\r Cuar\u00f3n strays into tried and tested Hollywood characterisation with his two leads, the newbie and the veteran. Similarly, the action settles itself in the typical action movie camp, demanding suspension of disbelief from the audience. It\u2019s easy to lose count of the times someone miraculously grabs the very last railing before hurtling off to their doom, but for every time this happens, cinematic karma provides another situation when luck runs out, and their fate appears sealed.\r George Clooney appears as Lt. Matt Kowalski, an old space dog enjoying his last spacewalk as he pipes country music through his suit. Clooney\u2019s got the experience: this isn\u2019t his first voyage to the stars, or the first time his ship\u2019s gone down. However, the story really belongs to Bullock, who inhabits her character Dr. Ryan Stone (\u201cmy dad wanted a boy\u201d) with emotional intensity.\r Stone has none of Kowalski\u2019s confidence, and is terrified when things go awry. We learn she has lost a young daughter, and since then retreated into her research. Cuar\u00f3n revisits themes of futility explored in Children of Men as Stone must decide whether to resign herself to fate and be reunited with her daughter, or fight desperately for life. With little desire for self preservation, she teeters on the verge of accepting the former more than once.\r The tool of her absolution is a symbolic rebirth, explicitly visualised when she removes her bulky spacesuit for the first time and drifts in a foetal position, the cable that tethered her to the ill-fated shuttle floating past as a suggestive umbilical cord. Dressed simply, her vulnerability at this point is reminiscent of Sigourney Weaver\u2019s Ripley in Alien (1979).\r Gravity is the latest exploration of how far visual technology has come since the pioneering Avatar (2009). While that film basked in the visual candy of alien flora and fauna, Gravity\u2019s portrayal of the vacuum of space, and the perceived lack of a certain fundamental interaction, invites comparisons with other masterpieces of space on film.\r Themes of rebirth and the use of long, uninterrupted shots owe a debt to 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), which is ultimately wider in scope. Though elegance remains in Kubrick\u2019s classically scored wide shots of docking spacecraft, Gravity ups the ante by dynamically moving the camera through these long sequences, swooping around characters and spacecraft to fully exploit the versatile digital environment. Composer Steven Price\u2019s score meanwhile is haunting silence highlighted by thunderous crescendo. Long shots are interspersed with the view from Bullock\u2019s perspective, emphasising disorientation as she spins out of control.\r It\u2019s hard to believe 2001 was released 45 years ago when its effects, created sans computer, still appear so realistic. Kubrick achieved weightlessness with strings, while cameras filming from unconventional directions turned the pendulum-like swing into weightless drifting in another axis. The iconic floating pen was achieved by fixing it to a transparent sheet of rotating plastic. It\u2019s a mark of how far effects have come that multiple pens, along with a plethora of other equipment, frequently spin past Bullock as she clambers through space station interiors.\r Apollo 13 (1995) eschewed special effects for the real thing, filming aboard NASA\u2019s astronaut training aircraft, the famous \u201cVomit Comet\u201d which completed hundreds of descents to give the film makers enough time to shoot. Incidentally, another link between the films sees (or hears) Apollo 13\u2019s mission controller Ed Harris reprises his role as the voice of Houston at the start of Gravity. Notably absent in Gravity are the Earth-based back stories and cutaways to Houston\u2019s desperate attempts at rescue  exactly the kind of narrative that padded out Apollo 13. When communications go down early in the film, they are completely on their own.",
