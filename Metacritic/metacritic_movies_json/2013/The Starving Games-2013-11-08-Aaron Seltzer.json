        "It seems even more slapdash and desperately unfunny than their earlier work.",
        "The writing-directing team of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer now take aim at \"The Hunger Games\" with their latest effort, The Starving Games, and the fact that the title, as witless and uninspired as it may be, constitutes its humorous high-water mark should indicate just how ineptly they handle things this time around.",
        "The Starving Games is the sixth directorial effort from Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, and they are nothing if not consistent."

Ever since the mainstream \"Scary Movie\" in 2000(Which was good, actually) parodies have been nothing original, same slapstick-turned-wired comedy and randomness that does not seem so random anymore. It seems like that overtime, the genre has been losing what sense is left in the plot and focusing on parts that will make you say \"What the f*ck?\" and then laugh with your friends. This movie(along with other parodies) are not meant to be watched alone, but with friends, then talk about the funny parts with other friends and so on. Overall this movie lies within all the other parodies of the 2000's- A conversation starter.",

In the years that have followed, we've even seen franchises like, Scary Movie, Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Superhero Movie, but when was the last time you saw a spoof that was actually any good? Because of my love of the Hunger Games, I actually gave it's spoof a chance and I'm sorry I did. There were a lot of things here that could have been made fun of, but they weren't. The film gets so desperate that they actually turn to Avatar, The Avengers, and the action star of the Expendables, to make the thing long enough to be a full length film. I understand that the purpose behind spoof films is to be so ridiculous, that people laugh at how stupid it is, but there is a point where it is so beyond stupid and childish, that no one finds it funny anymore. The Starving Games quickly crosses this line and doesn't go back. It's a comedy making fun of one of my favorite series of all-time, a series I know like the back of my hand, and I hardly laughed. The only thing this film does well is cast actors who closely resemble the cast of the Hunger Games franchise. Beyond that, the acting is terrible, the jokes wouldn't even make children laugh, and the story is so out there, that eventually you're not even sure what they are doing. While spoofing big movies has become big business, this one does nothing but annoy everyone who was dumb enough to watch it.",
