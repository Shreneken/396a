    "critic_reviews": [
        "It\u2019s profoundly moving and thoroughly mind provoking, but despite the poignant subject matter, I promise you will not leave Philomena depressed. I\u2019ve seen it twice and felt exhilarated, informed, enriched, absorbed and optimistic both times.",
        "A terrific, sophisticated comedy that tackles serious issues with a lightness of touch and a spirit of steel, Philomena is the British film to beat come BAFTA time.",
        "Philomena has a few modest missteps, and a frustrating moment or two (Philomena is more forgiving than Martin \u2013 and the audience \u2013 want her to be), but the film is so moving, so brisk, and so sweet that it is hard to be left with anything resembling disappointment.",
        "Effective, fact-based melodrama that packs an unexpected emotional wallop.",
        "Dench and Coogan's chemistry is undeniably great. In the end, he manages to give her the answers she seeks and she manages to give him a heart.",
        "Stephen Frears is in full possession of his filmmaking talent in Philomena, one of his most pulled-together dramas in years.",
        "Even through improbable moments and abrupt changes of pace and tone, Ms. Dench and Mr. Coogan hold the movie together.",
        "Getting full comic effect from its class-comedy abrasions, Philomena rises to poignancy and profundity as Dench reveals her control of a character stained by the loss of her child and troubled by her suspicion.",
        "The Catholic Church does not come off well in Philomena, but then, what else is new? And the film isn't so much an indictment of institutional unkindness as it is a story of resilience, resolution - and human kindness.",
        "Philomena is a tearjerker of rare honesty and craft.",
        "At its core, this clever, wrenching, profound story underscores the tenacity of faith in the face of unfathomable cruelty. Evil may be good, story-wise. But virtue, at its most tested and tempered, is even better.",
        "Director Steven Frears deserves special mention. A lesser filmmaker could so easily have turned this project into mushy, sentimental junk. The tear-jerking moments here are heartfelt and real. It\u2019s the kind of filmmaking we see too little of today.",
        "Most of its pleasures come from the way it confounds expectations.",
        "It's Dench, showing how faith and hellraising can reside in the same woman, who makes Philomena moving and memorable.",
        "Most credit goes to Coogan for the success of this odd coupling.",
        "Philomena is simply one of those small, true stories that astonish in print and inspire good movies.",
        "It's certainly a crowd-pleaser...and something close to a triumph, if not an unqualified one.",
        "Philomena could have been a sappy movie, but it\u2019s not. Instead, with such assured performances, it\u2019s proof that sometimes a laugh makes swallowing a big dose of outrage a little easier.",
        "The movie is overcalculating and occasionally coarse, but it has a gentle spirit. We should count its existence as a blessing.",
        "Director Stephen Frears, working from a book by the real Martin Sixsmith, isn't about to let the Irish church off the hook for a monstrous (and well-documented) chapter in its history. In flashbacks, he pictures the young Philomena as a sort of proto-Katniss, doing battle with a tyranny of nuns.",
        "A trip to America bears its share of exasperated hotel-room humor, but watch both actors lean into characters seeking redemption; their clash is invigorating, with a mature payoff that has two minds meeting and getting further along. It\u2019s a tonic to all the Oscar-season showboating: Call it Best Duo.",
        "The grande dame's performance, alternately goofy and grave, is an absolute tour de force.",
        "Odd-couple chemistry from Dench and Coogan, a smart script and honed direction make this real-life story highly compelling. Blending comedy and tragedy, it secretes a potent sting.",
        "It's a terrifically moving film that has a fitting earthbound feel to it.",
        "This is a heartbreaking story \u2013 how could it not be? But Frears\u2019 film breaks your heart and then repairs it.",
        "Its main focus is the sparky, shifting relationship between its two protagonists and its trump card the startling chemistry between its two main stars.",
        "Philomena honors its namesake by valuing potent understatement over potential hysterics.",
        "It's simple and well-told, although nothing about it is breathtakingly original.",
        "Philomena is a wiser movie than it seems, with much to say about justice and forgiveness and the healing of wounds over time. Actually, it says next to nothing about any of those things, just implies its messages with a light hand.",
        "At times the filmmakers seem to be taking potshots at Philomena for her placidity; other times Martin is made to seem crass and unfeeling \u2013 insufficiently spiritual. Life lessons are imparted, although the players never budge very much from their initial attitudes.",
        "Compelling, poignant and gently funny.",
        "Still, that doesn\u2019t detract too much from what Philomena manages to accomplish: a sober consideration of how ideals relate to institutions \u2014 whether they\u2019re religions or political parties \u2014 anchored by two well-rounded, funny lead performances.",
        "Philomena turns out to be a subtly told tale of tragedy and redemption, with much of the sentimental payoff you\u2019re expecting but several intriguing plot twists along the way.",
        "Dench is not the only reason to see this unapologetic crowd-pleaser, but she is the best one.",
        "What makes it effective isn\u2019t the facts of the case, so much as the way Philomena lets viewers spend time with its characters and get to know exactly who\u2019s getting hurt.",
        "It\u2019s an undeniable whopper of a yarn and, coming after a string of middling efforts from Frears, easily the director\u2019s most compulsively watchable picture since \u201cThe Queen.\"",
        "For the viewer, however, solving this mystery is not nearly as engrossing as watching the actors\u2019 pas de deux.",
        "The movie wouldn\u2019t stand for much of anything without such an effective team to represent the equivocating.",
        "Mr. Coogan, lavishly talented as a comic, and a comic actor, is fairly monotonous in the mostly serious role he wrote for himself. That leaves Ms. Dench to carry the picture, which she does, up to a point, with her usual delicacy and grace.",
        "A human-interest story that claims spite for human-interest stories, the film has some pretty divisive issues at its core that leave it torn between contrasting approaches.",
        "With Philomena, British producer-writer-star Steve Coogan and director Stephen Frears hit double blackjack, finding a true-life tale that would enable them to simultaneously attack Catholics and Republicans. There\u2019s no other purpose to the movie, so if 90 minutes of organized hate brings you joy, go and buy your ticket now."

These 'fallen women' were forced into convents which were run like work houses in order for them 'to cleanse their sins'. Many were in their early teens and most never saw their children again after adoption. This film concerns the search by one such mother,Philomena, who along with a journalist sets out to find the son she hasn't seen in nearly 50 years.\rJudi Dench plays the title character and her performance is a class act. She gives an effortlessly briliiant and believable portrayal of this tortured, but hopeful woman. She is an actress to whom her art just seems to come naturally and she is again at the top of her game. Steve Coogan is also very good as the journalist and he can take another bow for co-authoring the richly textured screenplay. Whilst the writing tackles serious issues it still manages to tap into some wonderful humour in the midst of this desperately sad situation. The film, though, is certainly never mawkish, but it is at times genuinely affecting. In fact, the only thing that comes out bad here is the light shining on the Catholic Church.",

The catholic church once again does not look good in a film, although the atrocities took place 60 years ago in 1950s Ireland. Apparently nuns would take young parent-less women into their convent who had babies out of wedlock and eventually sell their babies to wealthy Americans (true story believe it or not). The story is about one mother who decided to search for her son that was taken away from her 50 years earlier. She accepts the help of an author who hears about the story from the woman's daughter. They have an adventure together, going to America to find the son. There is a surprising amount of humor in addition to the heartbreak.

It sounds like one of those dramas that could deteriorate into sentimentality, but under the assured direction of Stephen Frears it maintains integrity and heart.

The movie chronicles the story of Philomena's quest in search of her long lost son which travels all the way across the ocean to different countries. And again this incredible story ended in the hands of a great director. The director Stephen Fears just put some magic spell on the story and it became a soulful movie with the fine support from his cast and crew.\r The movie was just like I wanted. From each level of the story, it surprised with the beautiful turning points. It was a single movie, but I felt I saw part by part, chapter after another with detailed information. 'Philomena' is phenomenal movie of the year. The depth of emotions can be felt through our heart, very touching story. An inspiring movie for other mothers who are still looking for their lost children. One should never lose his 'hope', it can be used as a powerful weapon to discover what had you lost.\r I had seen plenty of nature documentaries about a mother and love towards her kids. It might be a polar bear from Arctic or a penguin from Antarctic they all fight for their little ones and ready to give her own life when it matters. In this movie Philomena's (Judi Dench) child was taken away from her under some tough circumstances. She kept it secret in her sealed lip but never stopped to look for him. She waited for 50 year-long, finally with the help of a former BBC journalist, Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), she succeeds to follow the tracks. Whether the mother and son unite or not is the movie's end.\r As far I know the best ever performance by Steve Coogan. This movie definitely will boost his confidence for his future project and also will help his professional graph go upwards. Never doubted the James Bond lady (M), Judi Dench as Philomena. Her experience came to very useful to shape up this movie well. Never could have been this much exciting the movie without these two along with the director. Hope they all join hands together for another project in the near future.\r 9.5/10",

That of a mother but also that of a journalist whose pseudo certainties are shattered, which, paradoxically enough, makes him stronger by giving him (back) the capacity to be moved by another human being. Judi Dench depicts in a breathtaking way all the complexity and the density of the emotions and thoughts of this luminous Philomena. She achieves this with the grace and the delicacy which are part and parcel of her acting skills and with this extraordinary capacity she possesses to embody the beauty, the frailty and the strength of the human soul.",

As a result, the nuns at her church took her child away and sold him, along with many others, to adoptive parents. Now on a quest to find her son with journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), Philomena is a truly affirmative, moving, and well-constructed true story.\r Often times true stories can slack a bit in terms of pace and interest, simply because you can see the way in which the director is constrained and forced to stay to the story. Philomena certainly does not showcase any of this. Instead, director Stephen Frears ably handles this true story that is interesting in its own right, but he does a great job wringing the drama and emotion out of this. As a result, Philomena is not just a film that tells a story of a mother looking for her son. Instead, it is a universal tale of journey and discovery for both Philomena and Sixsmith and a film that has a heart. There is a heart and soul to this film as it passionately tells this tale of injustice.\r With truly brilliant performances from Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, Philomena further convinces me that I need to see more of Steve Coogan. I have only seen him sporadically, but that is clearly not enough. Together, they have terrific chemistry and they work together to find Philomena's son and find out what happened to him after 50 years. Dench plays Philomena with incredible class and majesty, as is to be expected for a woman with such dignity and prowess. The scene in which Philomena forgives Sister Hildegard for all of her sins against Philomena is incredibly powerful. The way in which she can forgive someone who wronged her so much is something that we all could learn from. Dench plays the scene to perfection with incredible emotion, yet with equal strength.\r The film does a great job not just making me fight back tears, but also dramatically. As the duo try to uncover the mystery, the film is packed to the brim with drama, furthered by the hurdles they must overcome in order to discover the truth. Though cliched in spots in this regard, Frears does a good job executing the cliches and still manages to make it damn near thrilling as they sort through the evidence and find her son. Above all, however, the film is truly emotional, particularly the ending and when Martin discovers the truth about Philomena's son. Frears does a terrific job capturing these moments, while his two leads do a great job capturing the power of those moments and their significance.\r Though it may be written off as Oscar bait by some, Philomena is a terrifically well-executed film that is emotional, powerful, and truly dramatic. Telling a deeply compelling real life story, Philomena does its protagonists justice with a film that captures the essence of both of their journeys into the past and into themselves. As a whole, Philomena is a moving film blessed with great acting, directing, and strong dramatic writing.",

That wonderful hybrid of quality drama, subtle, well-balanced acting and a sprinkling of welcome humor. Not to mention it all hung together around a meaningful and interesting subject matter.\rBased on the true story of Philomena Lee, an elderly Irish woman who became pregnant as a teenager and had her child taken away from her by the Catholic Church and sold for adoption it truly is not just a fine piece of work from a idiosyncratic director but an example to all about how to make dramatic cinema. Its also a a high watermark in terms of its tear jerkiness. very seldom do you see a sentimental film full of appropriate humor and a lack of tacked on manipulated mawkishness. Take note War Horse, Les Mis, The Impossible and company.\rI have never been a huge fan of Dench but here she gives the performance of a lifetime(wrinkles have never looked so engaging) backed up wonderfully by Coogan who is mildly eccentric and tempered but deeply moved all at the same time. My only concern would be the glaring convenience that pops up half way through but Frears keeps things so tightly wound that you feel completely tolerant of it straight away.\rThe movie has received some rare bashings by some critics who argue its intentions regarding its take on the Catholic religion. I say what goes around comes around and this deserves to be seen by everyone with a keen interest in, well, human interest stories.",

Steven Coogan and Jeff Pope's adaptation from Martin Sixsmith's book may be short and edited nicely but isn't smart or effective as the writers think. If the script is a let down, then Stephen Frears saves it brilliantly through its amazing execution skills that doesn't fail to impress the audience. Judi Dench stands alone on performance in here as she is the core strength and the highlight of the feature despite of Steve Coogan's decent act. Philomena is surely an important feature that draws out essential questions and emotions on screen but on terms of drama; that is its genre, it fails to create the anticipated impact.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nIts hard not to feel sorry for Philomena, her ordeal being well portrayed - the scenes set in the nuns home are quite harsh and chilling. She comes across as someone with a real passion and determination, quite a steely person, although she clearly hides a lot of emotions which do come to the fore at times. Knowing this is based on a true story certainly gives it more impact, thats for sure. It could also be said that in some regards she's quite simplistic and even somewhat like a kid when in the US, gleefully pointing out to a rather uninterested Martin about the bewildering choice of breakfasts available at their hotel for one and apparently being so impressed with the service provided by hotel and restaurant staff that she labels them one in a million, to which straight talking Martin points out that statistically thats very unlikely. Their two quite different characters, both no nonsense in their own ways but both with their own questions and angles on the whole story, which makes for interesting viewing. There's also an element of comedy present, which comes as a form of light relief given how heavy the subject matter is, all things considered. Comedy is delivered through some witty exchanges of dialogue. The plot runs at a good pace throughout, it certainly doesn't lag and as the story starts to be told,the turn of events are quite surprising and makes you more and more intrigued about where it'll all end. I found myself wondering which person I agreed with, or related to more somehow, Philomena or Martin, in different ways. They certainly have their spats and both have very clear stances on the morality behind what happened, where blame lies and so on. The movie features flashbacks to when Philomena had her chance encounter (at a funfair of all places) that led to conception in the 1950s, as well as obviously the scenes of her in the work house, realising her son was being taken away but also, moreso perhaps, are the old film reels shown of Antony growing up - its a bit tantalising as it made me question things, presumably what went through Philomena's mind at the time, when we couldn't really get answers to them, although to be fair I was keen on the ending, which I thought was quite touching and poignant. The musical score was also quite spooky and poignant. There are some confrontational scenes between Philomena and Martin and their different takes on what happened but also between Martin and the authorities and the nuns at the old nuns retreat. This is definitely a movie to have tissues at the ready for but as well as it being a bit of a weepy, it did make me think about what happened and I'd say that the theme of forgiveness is a very strong one present. I liked that at the end, a series of statements is shown across the screen which explains what happened afterwards, whats become of both Philomena and Martin.More generally its about religion and the influence that it had on people, how controlling those seen in authority were and so on. I felt that this movie was well made in terms of the two main characters being both rather quirky, the dialogue is good and the plot moved at a decent pace, although it doesn't have a big screen feel to it, it could well be (or have been) an afternoon TV movie or similar, it definitely character driven more than relying on fancy camerawork or special effects, there's no need for any of that. I found Judi Dench's acting in this movie to be pretty top notch really - her emotions are clear to see, her frustration, determination, joy and so on are very well portrayed and indeed I'd say that her performance outshines Coogans, although he also gives a pretty good performance as well and the two of them do seem to gel quite well on screen. I'd also like to add that Sophie Kennedy Clark (who portrays Philomena as a teenager, when she gave birth and worked at the convent/work house) also gives a very good, emotive. performanceSome plot elements seemed a little convenient, such as how Martin managed to get ahold of clippings that identified Antony - I'd have liked to have seen a bit more of an explanation in terms of how certain things were tracked down, rather than just the end outcomes as they were shown but obviously this is based on a true story, so convenient or not it does come from real life. I might have liked to have known a bit more about Martins background too, although enough was shown to make it clear that both main characters have self perhaps self doubts and have had tough times. I suppose it was better to tell such a hard hitting, important story of our times in a somewhat concise and 'to the point' way, rather than potentially losing viewers in a maybe unnecessary long winded version of the story, if it may have become too dark and depressing. Maybe it packs more of a punch, so to speak, in conveying such a story in all of an hour and forty minutes, which is a pretty short running time.",
