Adèle imagines that the mysterious, blue-haired girl she encounteredBlue is the Warmest Color centers on a 15-year-old girl named Adèle (Adèle Exarchopoulos) who is climbing to adulthood and dreams of experiencing her first love. A handsome male classmate falls for her, but an unsettling erotic reverie upsets the romance before it begins. Adèle imagines that the mysterious, blue-haired girl she encountered in the street slips into her bed and possesses her with an overwhelming pleasure. That blue-haired girl is a confident older art student named Emma (Léa Seydoux), who will soon enter Adèle's life for real, leading to an intense and complicated love story that spans a decade and is touchingly universal in its depiction.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "It's a shattering masterpiece about sexual awakening, heartbreak, and self-discovery.",
    "Blue is the Warmest Color is subtitled “Adele: Chapters 1 and 2,” and by our last glimpse of this ordinary, extraordinary young woman walking down a street, we can’t help but long to know what she’s going to let herself in for next.",
    "Once you’ve hacked your way through the jungle of controversy, you will, in Abdellatif Kechiche’s already-notorious, rough-edged romance, encounter a small (though far from short) masterpiece.",
    "Kechiche’s intention – fully realised – is to immerse the viewer completely in the nuances of the relationship. By the close, one feels (and this is not meant as a facetious dig) one has lived through the girls’ experiences in something like real time.",
    "For three hours, Kechiche puts the audience on a ride nearly as exhilarating and exhausting as that endured by Adèle and Emma, Adèle and Léa. The film is like a tough exam that everybody aced. The director, the actresses, the moviegoer — we all deserve a très bien.",
    "What makes this melancholy relationship drama play out as more than a hot lesbian remake of Annie Hall is the vibrant connection between the two gifted actresses at its center.",
    "Nothing about the film’s coming-of-age narrative, nor the rise and fall of its core romance, is intrinsically new or daring, yet Kechiche’s freewheeling perspective on young desire is uncommon in its emotional maturity.",
    "What you get in these performances is intelligence, emotion and physicality, and when they come together as combustively as they do here, what you get is something extremely rare - a film that catches the messy, hot complexity of life and love.",
    "Affecting and powerful in its portrayal of love, Blue is the Warmest Color is an epic ode to the enduring affection which overwhelms when we find that special someone.",
    "Anchored by two of the most natural, committed performances you’ll ever see, Blue Is The Warmest Colour is the most moving love story of the year.",
    "Fearless, relatable and beautiful, this is one of the year’s best. Holding you so close for so long, you won’t want to break free.",
    "Blue Is the Warmest Color explores a life with a depth and force that would be scary - if it weren't so scarily good.",
    "Make no mistake, Blue Is the Warmest Color constitutes a breakthrough, in addition to being the best film of 2013.",
    "Hours, even days later, they may find themselves thinking of Adèle and wondering how she’s doing — only then realizing how completely this fictional but very real creation has winnowed her way into their hearts and minds. That’s great acting. It’s great art. And that’s why Blue Is the Warmest Color is a great movie.",
    "It’s a simple, even predictable story, yet textured so exquisitely and acted so forcefully as to feel almost revelatory.",
    "It’s perhaps the first great love story of the 21st century that could belong only to this century.",
    "The telling is beautiful and explicit. The truth of its emotionally raw, romantic drama is eternal and universal.",
    "Mr. Kechiche’s style is dizzy, obsessive, inspired and relentless, words that also describe Adèle and Emma and the fearless women who embody them. Many more words can — and will — be spent on “Blue Is the Warmest Color,” but for now I’ll settle for just one: glorious.",
    "Kechiche and his actresses explore the in-between—ecstasy, exploration, the comfort and eventual boredom of domesticity—and the aftermath, the painful shards of feeling we cling to after something has shattered. And they don't mess around when it comes to the ferocity of love, sex, or, God help us, the two combined.",
    "Less concerned with classic storytelling than with creating virtual performance pieces on screen, the film features dozens of extended sequences of Adele and Emma both in and out of bed—scenes that are virtuously acted and directed, even if they run on for longer than most filmmakers would allow.",
    "From this simple, not especially unique love story, Kechiche has fashioned an intimate epic.",
    "It is an extraordinary, prolonged popping-candy explosion of pleasure, sadness, anger, lust and hope.",
    "Blue Is the Warmest Colour really is an outstanding film and the performances from Exarchopoulos and Séydoux make other people's acting look very weak.",
    "Blue is the Warmest Color is a masterpiece of human warmth, empathy and generosity, because in a mere three hours, it gives you a whole new life to have lived.",
    "A damn near perfect film.",
    "Explicit lesbian lovemaking aside, Blue is, at heart, a somewhat ordinary coming-of-age romance, pulled and stretched nearly to its breaking point.",
    "Blue's raw portrayal of infatuation and heartbreak is both devastating and sublime. It's unforgettable.",
    "Kechiche excels at capturing his protagonist's emergence in the world.",
    "A beautiful, wise, erotic, devastating love story, this tale of a young lesbian couple’s beginning, middle and possible end utilizes its running time to give us a full sense of two individuals growing together and apart over the course of years. It hurts like real life, yet leaves you enraptured by its power.",
    "While the film refuses to be subtle with visual metaphor, Exarchopolous and Seydoux hungrily devour their scenes; they are articulate in ways both emotional and verbal, seemingly recreating, in detail, a sumptuous feast to share with an audience that could never possibly know how it tastes. But we get very close.",
    "It’s emotionally and sexually explicit, as raw as an exposed nerve at times, but Adèle and Emma have public lives as well as private ones, and the film’s great achievement is holding them in balance and observing how they relate to each other.",
    "The most consuming and most exhausting of its kind since “The Dreamlife of Angels,” fifteen years ago. From the moment when Adèle first catches sight of Emma, on a busy crosswalk, the movie restores your faith in the power of the coup de foudre and yet redoubles your fear of its effect; love, like lightning, can both illuminate and scorch. The problems of two little people, it turns out, do indeed amount to a hill of beans. Some hill. Some beans.",
    "The movie goes on for three hours without an emotional letup — it’s finally overwhelming.",
    "The winner of Cannes’s top prize, the Palme d’Or, and the international critics prize at the same festival, the film was hailed as a breakthrough, a graphic and emotional love story, the first same-sex feature ever to win the Palme, in the week after France legalized same-sex marriage.",
    "I’m pretty sure it would still be one of the best films of the year if the explicit lesbian sex scenes were censored, but it wouldn’t earn a penny in Peoria.",
    "Even with its limitations it's one of the necessary films of 2013.",
    "Watching Blue is the Warmest Color provides viewers with that rarest of motion picture opportunities: the ability to lose oneself in the life of another for three hours and to emerge having felt something.",
    "Blue Is the Warmest Color sweeps you up on waves of humor, heartbreak and ravishing romance.",
    "Often remarkable and often exasperating.",
    "Certainly the performances by Léa Seydoux (already an important screen presence) and newcomer Adèle Exarchopoulos are extraordinary. Their portrayal of a blossoming, fragmenting relationship is shot through with genuine grace and conviction even when the film itself descends into indulgence.",
    "An epic yet deeply relatable human drama, Blue Is the Warmest Colour offers far greater riches than its public notoriety would have you believe.",
    "Checking in at nearly three hours and so full of passions and appetites, it’s impossible for it not to exhaust you.",
    "The performances are nothing less than astonishing. It's easy to understand why the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival went to both actresses, though not easy for me to see why the movie itself was included in the unprecedented joint award.",
    "The rich atmosphere of the movie may be the sexiest thing about it: It’s no wonder these women breathe in the air of possibility and find themselves imbued with boldness.",
    "The movie is, mostly, interested in Adele’s interior life more than her exterior features. And in those moments where the reverse is true (they’re there), Exarchopoulos rightly refocuses the attention with an extraordinarily evocative performance of a confused, conflicted teen.",
    "The sexual content may be excessive (the movie could have gotten by with just one scene instead of three) and the running time a bit indulgent, but Blue is the Warmest Color grows in power and intensity.",
    "This saga of romance works with an unromantic style.",
    "If you don’t really understand women — or don’t even want to — it’s easier to just call them a mystery and let it go at that. For all the close-ups, that may be why Blue Is the Warmest Color never gets close enough.",
    "While there have been plenty of movie romances not unlike this, there's never been one told in such an ambitiously immersive way.",
    "Exarchopoulos is a revelation, wearing her neediness, vulnerability and arousal with every muscle in her face, her posture, even her hair. It’s an utterly naked performance, literally and figuratively.",
    "Abdellatif Kechiche reveals through his sense of composition, and collaboration with his remarkable actresses, a sensitivity to emotional nuance that's striking.",
    "Slow, low-key and often beautifully observed, Blue Is the Warmest Colour won't blow your mind, but it will charm your socks off.",
    "Exarchopoulos and Seydoux give their characters dimension and spark. Kechiche touches on issues of not only gender, age and sexuality, but also socioeconomic class. And if the movie doesn't quite seem to know when to end, it's because the director can't bear to say goodbye to these fascinating, fully-formed characters.",
    "Blue Is the Warmest Color has its wobbles, but Exarchopoulos will knock you sideways.",
    "Mostly a routine love story elevated by one of the year’s most magnetic performances.",
    "Overlong and dramatically thin.",
    "Kechiche's doting on entwined limbs, thrusting pelvises and oral stimulation, all carefully posed and continued longer than necessary to get his point across, races beyond titillation to creepy voyeurism."

It gave equal preferences to elements in the story. I mean it did not lean on the only sexual side, but emerged to explore on the emotional side as well. It briefs how hard a life as a gay and within that relationship problems like regular ones.\r The director used some of the outstanding tricks to capture many great scenes for the movie. Looked everything was realistic and natural including sleeping, fighting and street walking scenes and of course sexual intercourse. Yeah, it had too strong sex scenes like Steve McQueen's 'Shame' and I was shocked for its rawness. It shows how todays director's are fearless to show what they really wanted in their films.\r Like the original French title say 'La Vie D'adèle: Chapters 1 and 2' this movie divides its story telling into two parts. The first one reveals the journey of character Adèle to find what really she is and another spills the seriousness of its reality. Sometime we won't understand the reason for path we're choosing to travel in life. Once we're into it the after effects will teach more about the truth. This movie was rendered in such concept.\r Adèle was the center of the attraction. It was her real name as well the screen name. Every youngster will fall for her incredible innocent performance and for her wild beauty, especially for her rabbit teeth. There are many reasons why it was called Blue, As many of us believed because of blue hair of character Emma. But Emma comes somewhere middle of the story and later on she vanishes till the beginning of the ending. I thought maybe because of Adèle who wore a blue dress at the end, which warms her (life) after the disastrous previous years.\r The aggressive sex scenes from the movie drawn the barrier from the Oscar. Otherwise, this movie would have done great in 2014 Academy Awards. It is not fair to let it go because of the plot it deals, there's many things in it like life and relationship. If you are successful you will get the movie's message at the end with your sympathy and tenderness.",

      "content": "Seventeen year old Adele’s life is changed when she meets Emma, a sapphire haired university student, and her path changes from adrift high school student to a woman discovering herself and sexuality in Blue is the Warmest Color.\r BeautifulSeventeen year old Adele’s life is changed when she meets Emma, a sapphire haired university student, and her path changes from adrift high school student to a woman discovering herself and sexuality in Blue is the Warmest Color.\r Beautiful and honest, Blue is the Warmest Color is a realistic love story. I find it quite hard to say what it is about without it sounding banal. Adele is a confused girl, unfulfilled in her life, trying to figure out what she desires. Then, girl meets girl, girl likes girl, girl falls for girl, and girl’s relationship with girl follows its destined course. In the meantime, girl comes to grips with her desire, sexuality and identity. But it is poignant, sweet, sad, unflinching,\r The more naive and inexperienced of the two is Adele, played by Adele Exarchopoulos. She does a wonderful job of being both unsure and youthfully headstrong.  I enjoyed her character being so blase about pretenses and frivolity in the superficial. She is hilarious to watch eat food, Adele ravenously devours meals as if her appetite for sustenance is insatiable. Emma, played by Lea Seydoux, is the slightly older college student who Adele befriends, at first as a confidante and mild mentor, but soon that friendship evolves. Emma is free-spirited and confident without being pretentious or judgmental and Seydoux’s character warrants Adele’s infatuation.\r The film is raw, the sex scenes enthralling without being gratuitous and what you get essentially from Blue is the Warmest Color is a coming of age lesbian love story.\r More reviews of recent releases can be found at our website.",

Is it really possible to feel so profoundly? And can we possibly move on?",

This one was so dull and aimless, I took three days to finish it up. By contrast with other coming-of-age stories, we don't really know, at the end, whether Adele has learned anything significant about life, love or herself, aside from the facts that (a) she reallyreally likes lesbian sex and despite zero experience, can jump into it like a champ; and (b) breaking up is hard to do. It's disappointing that so little actual affection seemed to develop in the sex itself, even allowing for a period of initial raucous abandon. Adele also isn't developed that much. The director obviously relished showing her not just having sex, but eating, dancing, eating, drinking, teaching, blubbering, eating ... but whether she's smart or a dolt is hard to say. Finally (nitpicking) I love the way French films often show people who look \"real\" -- with sketchy skin, bad teeth, horrible hair, in this case ... but these two also have such perfect, pale, toned, utterly flawless hairless bodies, it's kind of ridiculous.",

However this film is clearly not for all public and I think the target is people who can be receptive to a strong love story (the gay things isn't a major aspect of the movie and a lot of people can see themselves through the characters) and the theme of the crossing line between teenage and adulthood. So you have to know what you're going to see, because unlike big blockbusters this doesn't fit to everybody. Sorry for my bad english (obviously it isn't my birth language ",

It realistically shows a young Adele coming to terms with her lesbian identity in a still rather homophobic French society.  It also shows rather well how one cannot control who ones falls in love with and how one's first love can seem like the universe.  And moreover, Adele simply doesn't fall for or sleep with Emma right away. It grows to that point which is really how life works.  Yet, their relationship doesn't work and rightly sends the message that cheating is detrimental in society where it is widely believed and glorified in the media that one's partner will do that.\r My complaints with the film are how long it is (even though you don't feel that as much as you might) and  how the long lesbian sex scene was, which essentially ended up being pornography.  I wasn't the only theatre-goer who giggled with absurdity when it simply would not end!  And not that I think one who watches porn is necessarily immoral; rather I think that the director shouldn't try to pass off what he'd produced in that scene as art.  He did it push boundaries and make a name for himself in the end.  But it's the filming technology and porn actor stand-ins that's becoming even more common in once taboo movies.

In the same way, this movie pretend to be \"an opera who defend and acclaim the homosexual love\" while in truth it's just porn for aroused teenagers.\r When I say that I watched this movie just to see the beautiful girls naked I will be accused by prissiest and conformists to be a perv or one who doesn't understand the movie, while in truth I'm only honest and I understand the movie more than them. But sincerity rarely get popularity. They prefer to play the sophisticated one and say that they love the movie because of the \"\"\"\"messagges\"\"\"\r As another confirm, the two actress are not even actress, they are MODELS. But you can see for yourself in the movie that they are not actress, since none of them can act proberly. But no one was interested in acting or story by the way.",

The last time I had to hide behind the seat in front of me was around 20 years ago when Jurassic Park came out. Watching  \"Blue Is the Warmest Color\" In a movie theatre I had to hide because of the sex scenes, which are quite good, but difficult to watch in a public spaces even if you have a lot of experience watching porn xD However, it is a good thing, as it is a new experience, not a bad thing. The movie itself is very realistic and honest: the characters act as they probably would have in real life, no unrealistic or accidental twists of plot that I could have noticed. I would believe if I was told that the movie is entirely based on a true story. The actors are also very good, their emotions seem sincere. Some people notice that the movie is above all about lesbian love. Actually the fact that the main characters are lesbian is not so important for the love story that is presented. This observation in itself is interesting: that a movie about lesbians is actually not about lesbians after all and, moreover, you are not expected to experience that love between lesbians is something out of the ordinary, it is shown as something mundane. As it should be.  Would recommend watching.",

IfBeauty is in the eyes of the beholder people say. Some may call this erotic French drama; art, others may say it’s pornographic; some may callll its premise an insightful study, others may say it’s a shallow excuse for graphic sex scenes. If you ask me, Blue is the Warmest Colour, like most works of art, is a bit indulgent; but it felt perfect! This was somewhat of a coming-of-age film about a teenage girl named Adele, and the tremendous changes her life incurs after she falls for an artsy, blue haired college woman named Emma. Adèle Exarchopoulos, who (conveniently) stars as Adele, gives a breakout performance. Her odyssey of sexual awakening and emotional maturity; as she comes to understand herself and the complexities of love was a committed performance. The character’s growth takes years; with the film spanning her awkward teenage years all the way through to young adulthood.  Exarchopoulos stands firmly, holding our attention for the entire time. Both her and her equally fabulous co-star, Léa Seydoux (as Emma), showed a great deal of bravery in their roles. My hat goes off to them. The final part of this trio was Abdellatif Kechiche, who obviously directed the hell out this movie and its stars. The way his camera stalks and zooms in on Adele at even her most intimate moments could almost be considered predatory. Also the detail he gives to those controversial sex scenes may have been excessive. In the end, it was all in the name of getting this character study across in the most meticulous way possible; and I must commend him for that. With so much commitment and hard work on all the corners of this film, it’s no surprise how persuasive Adele and Emma romance was. I was taken aback by it, and captivated for the film’s entire three hour run time. Blue is the Warmest Colour was a keen study that was thoroughly moving. Beauty was certainly in the eyes of this beholder.",

Now one of the actress Adèle Exarchopoulos that I never seen before in anything until this and I got to say that she is a actress I would like to see in more roles showing off her talent. I have seen Léa Seydoux before in movies like Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, Midnight in Paris, The Grand Budapest Hotel and Inglorious Bastards, and just like I said about Adèle Exarchopoulos I would like to see Léa Seydoux in more movie and well she is going to be in Spectre so there's that.\r The director of the movie Abdellatif Kechiche directs this movie so incredibly well and so magnificent that he understood teenagers today how they really act. It wasn't like Hollywood movies that normally get it totally wrong and have no clue on what teenagers are like today because Hollywood are just a studio with their heads up their own ass and have no clue on reality, then comes this movie that's not from a big Hollywood studio but from a different country and a different director who actually have touch of reality on it's characters and how young people discovering their sexuality, and that's why Abdellatif Kechiche pretty much made this movie work.\r Now I hear a lot of people saying that this movie is basically porn with the two lesbian and them having...you know what I'm talking about. Now here's the thing porn is basically not real and what I mean is that the actors are getting paid to do they business and the whole meaning of porn is to watch these people who probably don't know each other or don't really like each that much but they have sex anyway and after the video is done they get paid and off they go. Blue is the Warmest Color dose have sex scenes that you would find on PornHub if I have to be honest but it's more than just, the movie brilliantly shows a relationship, a break up, how much they love each other or do they love each other. It's things like this that isn't rocket science to work out and some people are making false arguments over pointless things in movies, some people are so stupid sometimes.\r The writing was realistic and brilliant, the movie is 3 hours long and it flew by me just like that.\r Now for problems: I haven't got that much to say when it comes to problems but if I have to really think of the things that I didn't like is that there are some scenes that I felt didn't really belong there and felt a bit fill, and that's it for problems, you see how small my problem was.\r Blue is the Warmest Color may not be a easy watch for some people but it shows a realistic look on sexuality and young people today that I think is what makes this movie great from start till the very end.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThe problem with  \"Blue is the Warmest Color\" is not pornography, it's Dogma...or at least it's legacy.\r For those who don't remember, Dogma - or Dogmé '95, if you prefer - was that style of filmmaking championed  by Lars von Trier and some other Danes that made the co-opting of direct cinema for the purposes of fiction filmmaking their \"revolution.\"  It's aesthetic was amateurism, poorly lit or completely unlit scenes, handheld camera work, only incidental music.  It promised to restore honesty and vitality to movies, something these filmmakers  felt was lacking in mainstream Hollywood cinema of the time. Twenty years ago this may have stood for something but the fact of the matter is that Dogma's aesthetic has  been completely absorbed into our visual vocabulary.  Whatever strength lied in the immediacy and spontaneity of its method has become a trope, a cliched code for \"reality\" and  \"honesty\" and  it's proliferation is increasingly just a cover for plain awful filmmaking.  Director Abdellatif Kechiche's film, \"Blue is the Warmest Color,\" is a great example of how (since this style and its variations are so ubiquitous a distinction must be made between the aesthetic of Dogma influenced dramas and the commonly employed style of the  \"mockumentary\" used to great effect in comedies that is basically a combination of direct cinema and cinema verite but not the subject of this critique).\r Where to begin with the ineptness of this film?  There's almost too much to talk about.  Lets just look at one of the worst scenes: Adele and Emma's first encounter.\rSo much has been made of the staginess of the sex scenes in this movie that no one has said anything about or even noticed the staginess of almost everything else in the movie?  Nearly every beat in this film feels false and sloppily conceived.  It's ironic that the very technique which is supposed to give a greater sense of reality to the picture actually exposes its fraud.  Adele first sees Emma in the middle of a cross walk.  Adele crosses the street one day soon after her first kiss with another girl and spots Emma, an apparently out lesbian who looks her over.  Adele stops in the middle of the cross walk to blankly stare at Emma as she passes her by.  Keep in mind this is a very busy crosswalk on a bustling street.  Miraculously, Emma, walking with her arm around another girl gives Adele a good looking over as well in the middle of the crowded intersection. This is their first encounter.  Now who stops in the middle of a busy intersection to stare at someone walking passed them?  Well, possibly someone possessed by some great  life forsaking impulse.  And then what fortune that the person you just looked at returns your stare with her own head cocking once-over as well!  Ironically, this scene is both overplayed and underplayed at the same time.  Stopping dead in the middle of an intersection is the kind of big deal moment that we would expect from an brash over-the-top Hollywood movie.  But this movie trades in the subtleties, the information gained by noticing the incremental changes on a person's face or in their behavior so instead of say, a set of dangerous or hilarious consequences befalling Adele as she stands there, nothing really happens at all.  She just stands there staring autistically for a very, very long beat.  Now I understand that she's apt to stare autistically, the movie makes a big point of it, but standing in the middle of traffic to do so is a dangerous faux pas.  If we're to believe she's suddenly found herself doing such a unusually thing on account of something so remarkable as Emma's beauty this is probably the opportunity to make a point of it.  But the movie just simply doesn't  seem to think much of it. The scene is handled so clumsily, so awkwardly straightforward  and absent of any kind of directorial insight or angle that the whole scene comes off comically unrealistic.  It completely lacks any sense of Adele's emotional intuition even though we can clearly see whats going on.  This is the subtle power of a director: to use a remarkable and unlikely event to show us something about a character's inner world, their desires, their realizations or their emotional progress.  If it works you might accept the absurdity of the situation that brought the insight forth ; it's a kind of slight if hand, the kind this director and Dogma would surely disdain.\r So what's the point of the intersection if you're not gonna do anything with it? The problem here is more than aesthetic.  It's the first time the director really fails to let us into Adele's world, to help us feel what she's feeling.  We merely cognate that Adele is attracted to Emma, we never feel that she is.  And even then we only cognate that because we have presumed what her desires might be after being spurned by the girl she kissed earlier in the film.  If it weren't for that scene we would really have no idea why Adele is staring at this girl.  The Hollywood filmmaking techniques that dogma eschews can convince us all kinds of fantastic fabrications from outer space monsters to zombie time traveling monkeys.  But these filmmakers struggle to make even the simplest concept ring true.\r It also doesn't help that they are also some of the most egregious violators of writing's essential concepts like the rule of \"show me don't tell me.\" These movies are so hampered by their rejection of normal story telling technique (and creativity) that they have to spend the entire time telling us what's going on.  It's ironic that a filmmaking style so confident in its ability to convey the immediacy of a character's world and experience must relentlessly fall back on the dialogue to tell us what the characters are thinking, feeling, planning and doing.  And in this movie, over and over again, the actors spew the same lines with the same meanings making the same points, ad naseam.  Kechiche has clearly found no other way to tell us that Adele is really obsessed with Emma other than to have her repeat that sentiment endlessly.  Film is a visual medium. Great films communicate visually, not with talking.  But Dogma disenfranchises filmmaking of its greatest strength - the image.  In its place it has attempted to revive the muscle of the writer, subtly implying that the image in its decadence has betrayed cinema's higher purpose.  But writing for the screen is precisely the art of writing so that things are visually comprehensible.  Every \"hack\" writer in Hollywood can do this but Dogma in it's mission to restore cinematic purity fails to deliver us any new useful idea.  And naturally, in the absence of any good writing, the enfeebled, hackneyed image they're left with fails to deliver as well.  Giant close ups of noses, eyes and mouths don't fill in the gaps of bad writing.  The documentary style they employ, so often fixed on the deep close up keeps us permanently on the outside of the actor. Instead of getting closer to a character we're stuck on their face, never allowed into their interiority.  There's just no lens long enough, no close up big enough to get inside a character's world.  The lenses of these filmmakers desperately search the faces of their actors looking for some look, some glance, anything that could get us in there. But, alas, nothing. The shots in \"Blue\" run on and on pressing the limits of acting - and our patience -but there's only so much an actor can do.  And these actors took it as close to the limit as we could ask but it still wasn't enough.  If only the camera  could burrow into the actor's faces.\r Now, don't get me wrong I understand the arguments about this Dogma style defying the traditional Hollywood narrative filmmaking that compromises the truth and integrity of a character and their moment in favor of a set of suspect narrative imperatives probably meant to accomplish the normalization of traditional values and conservative ideologies.  I even agree with this conceit!  And I also get that with a less lavish production (or in their case, no production at all) a  more disengaged (read: objective) view point should empower the audience to seek information from the actors themselves rather than getting that information shoveled to you.  These are nice ideas but this solution simply does not work.  The aesthetic and the meaning of this movie have no commonality.  They don't work together.  Here's the problem: the aesthetic is essentially a lie and the meaning of the movie remains elusive because the aesthetic actively impedes its delivery.  Dogma movies and their kin have merely created a different style of **** shoveling.  Only theirs is in the guise of the audience's free reflection.  But we all know that these filmmakers are including and excluding as much of a story or character as any mainstream film, just as committed to the delivery of a narrative, which restricts and expands reality as much as any other style.  Its just that these artists seek the imprimatur of a documented reality rather than the common fiction of popular movies (insomuch as direct cinema documentaries are guilty of the same kind of above described contrivance, the fact that they deal with actuality, not fiction deserves a forgiveness we shouldn't extend to Dogma).\r \"Blue is the Warmest Color's\" aesthetic can basically be described as botched voyeurism.  We're only allowed as much insight into the character's lives as a peeping tom could get but then once there all the things we see are at best un-informative and at worst badly blundered contrivances.  At least if we're going to have the privileged view point of a spy we should see things so intimate or private they could open a character's world to us.  But then again maybe that's just the fantasy of voyeurism and this movie is the reality: that spying on people probably tells us very little about other people or worse, that other people's lives are just as boring as our own.  That being said I don't think any of ours lives are quite as incredible as the ones on screen in this film.  Take the ridiculous break up scene where Adele simply walks out the front door after a blistering five minute fight with Emma and ends their relationship by politely closing the door behind her or the problem that we cannot tell that Adele is any more interested in Emma than anybody else she's with in the movie because nothing in her behavior or the filmmakers technique tells us either way.  In fact, since we have so little idea what Adele is feeling in this movie we must simply deduce that the relationship with Emma is the important one because its the one we have to endure for three hours...\rGod, I sure hope it was, I'd hate to have to watch a sequel.\r There are some good things in this picture...some of the acting is pretty good but the director unfortunately did nearly everything he could to get in the way of it. In that he succeeded mightily.\r Finally, don't get me started on the pornography.  This was not pornography.  I make pornography.  Pornography is beautiful, startling, dangerous, powerful, boring, arousing, open ended, liberated and enslaved all at once.  These people don't know the first thing about pornography.

The confusion of our early awakening sexuality, our search for identity and place in the world, the shock of discovery of true passion, losing oneself in another, young love and then deep love. Our identity entwined with another's, the building of balance and union, partnership and security, and endless days of joy.And from this grows a curiosity about limits, about life, about other possibilities. And then the surprise of carelessness, mistake, and tragedy. The profound pain, the agony that goes on, and never really ends. Longing and wishing and regret, which slowly dulls and is covered by busy-ness and life.And always, all your life, you remember and ache as you re-live those days, first true love, held inside, honoured but faded.And I am very lucky, for in this movie I re-lived all of this, all those memories awakened, those feelings and passions and joys, in this masterpiece of acting and writing and camera and direction. Joy and pain and love and life.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nUna storia d’amore. Che nasce per uno sguardo casuale in una piazza affollata, esplode di inarrestabile passione, poi inizia a raffreddarsi tra routine e piccoli malintesi, infine si conclude con amarezza a causa di nuove attrazioni anche se il legame fatica a spezzarsi. Adele è una liceale di Lilla che vive le incertezze proprie della sua età, tra una famiglia che non ne intuisce il difficile momento e una scuola di periferia animata però da insegnanti appassionati che ne alimentano l’amore per la letteratura. La sua omosessualità si disvela incrociando Emma, più vecchia di lei di qualche anno, proprio mentre sta andando all’appuntamento con un ragazzo: quando la ritrova in un bar per lesbiche dove è finita un po’ per caso e un po’ no,. ci vuole poco perché il rapporto diventi intensamente fisico e, per lungo tempo, si trasformi in una simbiosi allo stesso tempo totalizzante e liberatoria. Quando però Adele cresce e corona il suo sogno di insegnare all’asilo – inizia qui la seconda parte del film - si presentano nuove opportunità che finiranno per allontanare le due ragazze: i capelli di Emma - non più studentessa d’arte, ma pittrice - non sono più blu come nella prima parte e sono il simbolo della normalizzazione. Malgrado una scenataccia di gelosia che soffoca nella culla il rapporto dell’amante con un collega, è proprio Emma a rifarsi presto una vita con una nuova compagna, mentre Adele – più fragile – resta a fare i conti con il vuoto nella sua vita e una brace che non si vuole spegnere. L’idea che ci vogliano tre ore per raccontare una storia all’apparenza banale potrebbe spaventare, eppure – a parte una scena di sesso da circa otto minuti francamente pletorica (però, nel caso scappasse la pipì…) - il franco tunisino Kechiche gira un film in cui non si avverte il passare del tempo grazie a una capacità di raccontare con levità che rende estremamente scorrevole il passare dei minuti. Il tran-tran della vita quotidiana – la scuola, la famiglia, il lavoro – è reso interessante da un notevole cura per il particolare e, soprattutto, grazie a un’attenzione assidua per i volti e gli sguardi, con una speciale predilezione per quelli di Adèle Exarchopoulos, indagata da mille primi piani quando è sveglia e anche quando è addormentata con l’utilizzo di materiale girato fuori scena per accentuare l’autenticità. Il soggetto è tratto da un fumetto di Julie March, ma il regista e lo co-sceneggiatrice Ghalia Lacroix ne hanno eliminato qualsiasi effetto melodrammatico per raccontare una vicenda che dimostra che, se ogni amore è diverso a modo suo, tutti possono essere interessanti da raccontare (ma bisogna esserne capaci, ovviamente, come nelle delicatissime scene al parco quando il sentimento si dischiude) e non importa se il sesso dei due componenti la coppia sia uguale o diverso. Curiosamente, la questione che ha smosso la chiacchiera attorno al film viene ben presto accantonata durante la visione perché l’attenzione è attratta da aspetti più intriganti, dimostrando che spesso lo scandalo è nella mente di chi guarda: Kechiche sta dalla parte dei suoi personaggi e si limita a mostrare le reazioni delle persone attorno alle due ragazze limitandosi a indicare i due estremi del rifiuto un po’ ipocrita da parte delle compagne di scuola e della serena accettazione nella famiglia di Emma. Ne esce un film che unisce qualità narrativa e grande densità emotiva sprigionando un fascino sottile che si infila sottopelle e cresce con il passare del tempo dopo che i titoli di coda sono finiti: non è perfetto – c’è qualche lungaggine, le scene di sesso sono troppe e allentano la tensione, il rapporto di Adele con i genitori è inconsistente, il salto all’età adulta troppo brusco – ma si tratta di difetti ben lontani dall’inficiare la qualità complessiva che è stata con merito premiata a Cannes. Così come è giusto che sia stata riconosciuta la bravura delle due attrici che sono sempre al centro della scena – il resto del cast fa tappezzeria – protagoniste di un impegnativo tour de force da cui escono come meglio non si potrebbe disegnando due figure molto concrete, magari non particolarmente simpatiche ma estremamente reali (‘niente trucco sul set!’ pare abbia ordinato il burbero regista e la povera Léa Seydoux è stata costretta a studiare Brando e Dean per tirar fuori la propria parte maschile).",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nMy experience with the French Cinema is extremely limited. Hollywood is my thing and on Europe cinema I have always liked British cinema. So I might sound like a ignorant person while I review this piece of awkwardness. Too many close shots made me to close my eyes from time to time. Adele had the same expressionless face all the time in this movie. To be honest I've watch this movie to tear it apart and surprisingly this move had some good stuff from time to time. That little details that presented wrong really gave me a bad taste to mouth. First: There is not a thing called \"hard metal\" (although that name could be the subtitles fault). Second: While you are dreaming you are completely PARALYZED. You can't touch yourself while sleeping. The best thing you can do is to twitch your arm a bit. That first spaghetti scene is disgusting! In fact all eating scenes are disgusting in this movie. For a 3 hour long boredom stuff goes completely fast. You had a kiss? BAM! SEX! You went to club to see your friends? BAM! KISS! What the hell? Can't you do a little bit explaining and preparation for a 3 goddamn hour long movie? Because of these details are extremely fast the main plot goes too slow. It was utter boredom. I divided this movie into 3 parts in my mind. The complete disaster which is the first hour, a fairly nice middle hour and complete disappointment which is the final hour. Can I say that this \"15 minute long sex scene\" is a placeholder. Yeah it shouldn't be that long. It wasn't necessary. As a girl who had ZERO EXPERIENCE of lesbian sex she made a better job than porn stars. WHAT THE F***? How the hell can she be so good at this kind of sex without any experience? Because plot moves too slow and sub plots goes too fast a placeholder like that was necesarry. At first hour my score was 3/10 to this movie. I was clutching my face. Than in the middle hour movie starts to pick up the pace. Some interesting events happened and I got attached. During that times my score went up to 7/10. It was really good. Emma and Adele relationship  was shown perfectly. We see how LGTB people lives, what they feel? It was educational. This had to end at that hour. Because the disappointment which is the 3rd hour had come. Movie got a major step back to 5/10. It was boring. There wasn't anything happening during these hours and the stuff that mattered like Adele cheating was felt forced in to this movie. \"Yea let's have a bad situation to our happy couple because that's how the movies works. Come on guys this movie has to be three hours.\" -_-. I barely know anything about human psychology. I don't know nothing about LGBT psychology but I wouldn't forgive my same gendered partner which had sex with the opposite gender that easy. Let's come to another important factor in this movie. Can't I watch an artisctic film without any information on philosophers or painters? Can't I watch this movie without having any artistic integrity. Because I felt that the director is trying to say \"Why are you watching my movie you uncultured douche?\" to me. Adele's acting was good.  She shows some skill wherever it was necessary. Like the classroom scenes. Oh! Don't get me started on the cafe scene because when they were making up it appears they went invisible because no one told them to quit it. Making out in a cafe  is ok and understandable but starting to touching each other in a cafe had to put some eyebrows up. I've been to France and surprisingly never seen anybody touching each other. 5/10 until that ending. That ending was incomplete and it didn't bring any satisfying conclusion and brought one point down. If you want to see and learn more about lesbian life I recommend you to watch Boy's Don't Cry. Not this.",

This is not the first time I've ever seen a foreign film andI was planning on seeing this movie and got really interested and I was planning on watching it on my own cause it's a gay lesbian romantic drama in foreign language as in French. This is not the first time I've ever seen a foreign film and it's not the first time I've seen an NC-17 rated film considering that it has a lot of sex which are very realistic. Adèle played by who else, Adèle Exarchopoulos, is interested in falling in love with the collage boy but then finds herself with a blue-haired woman called Emma played by Léa Seydoux. So those two fall in love, go to the gay bar and have sex. So the whole movie is in French and good thing it has subtitles just so I can know what they're saying otherwise I'll get confused and won't know was going on, so I'll have to look at the subtitles while watching and all is done. Considering the fact that it's three hours long, it is completely worth it. The story is really well written, the actors and actresses who are from France have acted fantastically including Léa Seydoux and Adèle Exarchopoulos who have great chemistry on screen. And blue is my favourite colour and it is the warmest color. I have never seen in independent film with foreign language is as fantastic as I've ever seen. I gotta say my mum had no idea. I told her that people have to learn different language someday and she says that how can I order a coffee in different language. People! What do you do with them? Blue Is the Warmest Color is an impeccable drama foreign film that I've enjoyed in my point of view.",

The dialogues that supposed to deliver the struggle of the girl with the prejudice of a eterosexual society, aren't that good and result to be very stereotipical. Unfortunaly it's hard to fight prejudice on lesbians when the movie itself looks like a giant stereotype.Also generic reference to African cultures in France schools looks like very hipocritical if compared to the french position on immigrants back then (and remains still today 2020).So why such a mediocre movie doesn't fall into mediocrity?Because of sex scenes so extreme (and so long) to result almost pornographic. The first scene, barely 15 mins into the movie it's between a 20 yo lady and 34 yo man, with full genitalia displayed.Than different masturbation scenes follows. The apex is reached with a 5 mins or so lesbian sex scene with both girls licking each other's vagina. In the end the sex scenes succeded in differentiate this movie from others stndards drama, but I don't think this ends up being a good thing for it",

It has very explicit sex with full nudity and graphic depictions of sexFirst of all, it's a 3-hour movie! And I must say it was worth watching. This is a Heavy French drama with explicit sex, mature themes don't even require to say \"17+\".  It has very explicit sex with full nudity and graphic depictions of sex acts, mostly between two women, but one with a man also briefly shows an erect penis. As Adele falls for Emma, she encounters some homophobia at school, and it's not clear she's ever honest with her parents about their relationship. Aside from the sexual content, the appeal to teens is likely limited. The movie spends a lot of time on philosophical discussions, at first in the classroom and then among adult friends, using conversational dialogue to explore a host of issues that confront Adele as she learns who she is, and it does so for a solid three hours. Teens and adults often drink beer and wine with meals; excess is rarely shown. Lots of people smoke frequently, including the two main protagonists. Expect lots of profanity, with \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and variations used frequently.Director Abdellatif Kechiche gets amazing performances out of two young actresses and gives the viewer a lot to think about. The explicit sex certainly grabs the attention, but Blue Is the Warmest Color offers the adult viewer a great deal more to ponder. Teens, though, are unlikely to have the patience to sit through three hours of extended literature- and philosophy-class discussions or the equally extensive adult conversations along the same lines.The title in French includes (in translation) \"Chapters 1 and 2,\" suggesting there may be more chapters to come, which makes the excessive length less understandable. The lack of an ending, though, is much more understandable, if not less frustrating, once you know you've only seen the beginning of Adele's life.",

At the lowest common denominator, this is a French, lesbian teenage love story. But at a high level this is the ultimate love story, a TRUE love story from beginning to end that includes the awkward beginnings and heartbreaking ends. Honestly gender and sexuality have nothing to do with it, this story could be applied to any couple on the history of Earth.Basically it is a story of first love, the passion the follows and the eventual moving on....but most important is that the story is told by 2 INCREDIBLE actresses who take you along for the ride.
