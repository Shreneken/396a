  "critic_reviews": [
    "Middle-earth's got its mojo back. A huge improvement on the previous installment, this takes our adventurers into uncharted territory and delivers spectacle by the ton.",
    "Bilbo, as played by Freeman, suggests a sly-dog Dana Carvey without irony, and he is certainly overmatched, but that doesn't mean he's outplayed. Desolation is now his business.",
    "Smaug is different: a really good movie, superior to the first in that it brings its characters to rambunctious life.",
    "The thematic elements are in place, the emotional tension is highly strung, and the action unfolds in a wave like the fire erupting from the dragon's mouth, overtaking all in its path.",
    "Most middle movies in a trilogy simply mark time. Not this one.",
    "This is a rip-snorting, barrel-riding adventure movie — perfect for all ages, as they say (though it isn’t for very young kids) — loaded with fast-paced fight scenes, great-looking effects and enjoyable and/or scurrilous supporting characters.",
    "By the time the beast spreads his wings to full span, soaring skyward toward a vaguely Spielbergian moon, you’re in the kind of breathless awe that so few current cinematic superproductions are able to provide.",
    "Sure, all the studios offer anymore are big, dumb adventure spectacles, but that's not a knock against the achievement of this one, which at least parades wonders before us, not the least being the greatest dragon in the history of movies.",
    "Despite suffering from middle-act wobbles, The Desolation Of Smaug nevertheless delivers rousing action, incredible visuals and one stupendous dragon.",
    "The Desolation of Smaug is a cheerfully entertaining and exhilarating adventure tale, a supercharged Saturday morning picture: it's mysterious and strange and yet Jackson also effortlessly conjures up that genial quality that distinguishes The Hobbit from the more solemn Rings stories.",
    "The Desolation of Smaug is, on the whole, a vast improvement over The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. It’s a popcorn movie (in the best sense) disguised as deep-core nerdism.",
    "The best of The Desolation of Smaug is saved for the last, when Bilbo goes to steal from the massive fire-breathing dragon, Smaug. The orange-eyed beast is voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, who, through a sludge of voice-altering electronics, seethes and preens between fiery exhalations; this scene is one of the few occasions in the film where anyone actually takes time to talk.",
    "Second verse, same as the first, a little bit shorter and a little less worse.",
    "That dragon represents the best and worst things about the film. He’s terrifying yet slightly droll.",
    "At its best, Hobbit 2, which carries the subtitle The Desolation of Smaug, invites comparisons to Jackson's \"Lord of the Rings\" threesome.",
    "Never mind the dwarves and elves and wizards — maybe even the hobbit. The star of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is the dragon.",
    "The second part of Peter Jackson’s “The Hobbit” trilogy goes a long way — and at 2 1/2 hours, I do mean long — toward righting the wrongs of the first movie, which was even longer.",
    "Even though “Smaug” moves at a faster pace than the first part of the journey, it feels overlong. I still feel this whole Hobbit tale could have been told in one great, three-hour movie.",
    "Look for Jackson’s cameo in the opening, which sets the tone. Call it another visual triumph for New Zealand’s vision of Middle Earth.",
    "My advice to \"Hobbit\" fans is not only to see this one, but to see it as I did, in 3-D projected at the normal rate of 24 frames per second. The film will also be shown in what's called High Frame Rate 3-D, at 48 frames a second, but that made the last installment look more like video than a regular movie. Smaug is scary enough without a turbo boost.",
    "For fantasy fans who have dreamed all their lives of spending time inside Tolkien’s dazzling alternative reality, it’s a ride well worth taking.",
    "Jackson's latest go at Tolkien's treasured \"Hobbit\" story gets closer to that rich alchemy of fantasy, adventure, imagination and emotion that made his \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy such a triumph.",
    "After exhibiting an almost craven fidelity to his source material the first time out, Jackson gets the drama in gear here from the outset with a sense of storytelling that possesses palpable energy and purpose.",
    "This robust, action-packed adventure benefits from a headier sense of forward momentum and a steady stream of 3D-enhanced thrills.",
    "Some of the dwarves have nice individual moments, namely Balin (Ken Stott), Bofur (James Nesbitt), and Kili (Aidan Turner), and Gandalf gets to throw some potent magic around at Dol Guldur. But other than that (and the dragon itself), The Desolation of Smaug turns to be more of too much of a good thing.",
    "This Hobbit is, in other words, a much more eventful affair than its year-old predecessor. And yet for all the fine spectacle Jackson crams into his lengthy sequel-within-a-prequel, it’s still hard not to mourn the single, self-contained movie that could have been.",
    "Not only eight minutes shorter than its forebear, it's at least eight minutes better - less twee, less chatty, more action, more Elvish.",
    "But, oh, that dragon. I'd endure another slog through Middle-Earth just to spend more time with Smaug.",
    "There are things to like about the second Hobbit film - the director's vision of Middle Earth is as beguiling as ever - but the bloating that was a problem with An Unexpected Journey is an even bigger issue here.",
    "Visually stunning.",
    "There are, once again, too many busy, uninterestingly staged battles that lean heavily on obvious, sometimes distracting digital sorcery. But there are also pacific, brooding interludes in which the actors — notably Mr. Freeman, an intensely appealing screen presence — remind you that there’s more to Middle-earth than clamor and struggle.",
    "Much of the bloat is still there, but The Desolation of Smaug, the second film in the Hobbit trilogy, is a real improvement – filled with inventive action set pieces and dramatic face-offs that we (finally, at long last, hallelujah!) care about.",
    "It’s hard to fight the feeling that The Hobbit simply isn’t an epic story, and the efforts to expand it into one leave it feeling like an anvil crammed into a sock: The sock is taking on some weird shapes, and it’s being stretched awfully thin.",
    "The cast, including Orlando Bloom and Evangeline Lilly as warrior elves, is also excellent (though we don’t get even a glimpse of Andy Serkis’ Gollum). And individually, each escapade does hold its own thrills.",
    "It’s merely somewhat better than last year’s meandering dud — a slight improvement on a movie that should have been pretty easy to improve upon.",
    "This all essentially serves to distract from the fact that all that really happens in the film is that the company manages to eventually reach the mountain.",
    "When it's not stalled on silly, it falls into slog territory.",
    "We were promised desolation, but “The Hobbit” just keeps dragon on.",
    "Jackson has become too distracted by his digital toys to give his characters the same weight and importance he used in the Rings trilogy.",
    "A once-precious franchise's weakest installment, which forgets these adventures' magic was never conjured by bells and whistles.",
    "The Peter Jackson-directed Hobbit sequel might be the more vigorous, action-packed, darker and more (superficially) engaging version of the series thus far, but that doesn’t actually mean it’s a keeper of any sort.",
    "The second leg of Peter Jackson’s three-part adaptation of The Hobbit, by J. R. R. Tolkien, is mostly stalling for time: two or three truly great sequences tangled up in long beards and longer pit-stops.",
    "There are probably enough moments to satisfy hard-core fans, but for the rest of us, this amounts to the Middle Earth equivalent of  “Star Wars: Episode II —  Attack of the Clones,’’ a space-holding, empty-headed epic filled with characters and places (digital and otherwise) that are hard to keep straight,  much less care about.",
    "Results are all that matter, and the result here is that The Desolation of Smaug fails in almost every way, as a story, as an adventure, as a piece of art direction and as a visual spectacle."

If you thought An Unexpected Journey strayed a bit too far from the book: The Desolation of Smaug looks like the script writers didn't even know there was a book. The movie tries hard to change the story wherever it can, reducing fan-favorite chapters to 5 minute scenes and writing new content that feels out of place.\r But it's not only bad if you've read the book. I really wonder what the target audience is, because it feels like it's written for 15 year old boys. There are random action scenes every 10 minutes and 'funny' decapitations every 30. The worst thing here is that the action comes at the cost of character development. You have a band of 13 Dwarfs and a Hobbit, yet you rarely see them interact.\r Now I like Elves more than Dwarfs, so I didn't mind seeing so much of them in this movie. But having them show up in every place to save the day feels wrong. Perhaps Peter Jackson thought his cast of Dwarfs wasn't good enough to create an enjoyable movie? Gandalf's scenes in Dol Guldur were an interesting addition in concept, but they are just too slow. I feel his scenes mostly serve as an attempt to raise The Hobbit to The Lord of the Rings' level of epicness. And that just doesn't work.\r The story is full of illogicalities. How does entering the mountain to steal the Arkenstone to unite the Dwarfs to kill the Dragon to enter the mountain work exactly?? And remember that heartwarming last scene of An Unexpected Journey, where Thorin finally accepts Bilbo? Well, that's all gone again. Even though he keeps outsmarting all the Dwarfs, Bilbo is back to being an unappreciated 5th wheel of the party. And did the writers really think viewers would be so desperate for a love story that they'd enjoy an Elf and a Dwarf flirting it up? Their scenes feel forced and are painful to watch.\r Martin Freeman's acting is top notch again, but sadly he hardly gets any screen time. He only shines in his scene with Smaug. Now Smaug as a character is awesome, no complaints there. Yet most of his scenes are way too dragged out. There's a 20 minute scene with the Dwarfs running around thinking they can defeat him. Only at that point the movie already hinted at the only possible way of defeating him. Perhaps the worst aspect is that these scenes make Smaug look like an unintelligent creature. Dwarfs luring a Dragon around by going \"Nana-nanana you can't catch me!\" is not only silly and cliché, it's an insult to Smaug's character.\r Final complaint: the whole movie builds up to a scene.... that's apparently going to be the opening scene of movie 3. Nobody in the cinema was sure if the movie had ended, or there was just an awkwardly long pause when the screen went black.\r A movie like this you'll want to see, no matter how good or bad it is. You can't miss out on such a huge release, especially when it looks gorgeous in HFR 3D. But where I watched each Lord of the Rings movie 3 times in cinema, watching The Desolation of Smaug just once was enough for me.\r In the end, most problems of the movie seem to stem from the decision to turn the cute Hobbit tale into three epic movies that have to live up to the Lord of the Rings hype. It doesn't work.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nI LOVED the first film in this series. The Hobbit was a wonderful recreation of the first part of the book, with a few embellishments here and there that I endured. This, however, was a complete embarrassment to the Lord of the Rings series, J.R.R. Tolkien and Peter Jackson. I wanted to love it, I even forced myself to sit through the entire thing in theaters, but I just hate it. I would not take a copy of this home if you offered it to me for free, because I know watching it would only make me angry and disappointed all over again. As someone who has read all of the books and previous movies, this just felt like a pathetic excuse for a move today. This just felt like a \"filler\" film between two movies. Perhaps it was the producers being greedy, wanting 3 movies out of a book that is smaller than the smallest volume of the Lord of the Rings. However it happened, it was just disgraceful. More than half of the scenes were pulled straight out of thin air. Only a few were actually from the book this trilogy is supposed to be based on, like the barrels scene and Bilbo's talk with Smaug (although the sequence the followed was NOTHING like the book's version). What little plot that was included was embellished and out of order, and honestly were ruined for me by the imagined plots thrown into the film. On top of all that, this film had terrible pacing, and was outright cheesy at times. This was just a really, really sad excuse for a sequel. I wish they had just followed the book and stuck to two movies, the original plan. Not even sure if I am going to see the third one at this point, given the way this one turned out. Such a big fan of Tolkien's work and what Peter Jackson has done with his other novels, but this was just painful. Friends don't let friends who have read the book watch this move. Gets a 0/10 for me. I felt like not only did I waste my money, but I should have been paid to watch this poor excuse for a film.",

It's as if Jackson simply read the chapter titles and shot a movie with what he would think was in a chapter that could have such a title.\r Jackson spends far too much time truncating interesting portions of the story simply so he can fit more \"nowhere-in-the-book\" action scenes in spots that should have been done in one cut. Barrels out of Bond is a perfect example of this. Jackson lacks the concept of building a story up to a climax and simply turns the dial to 11 the entire time.",

Like many, I love The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but the prequel trilogy has yet to impress.\r That’s not entirely true. Peter Jackson’s cameo made me laugh out loud. I also loved the visuals. My only complaint with An Unexpected Journey’s visuals was that the orcs looked totally different than they did in the LotR movies. Thankfully, the orcs (with the exception of that pale fellow and his chum) are back to their old menacing look and feel.\r But TDoS does not impress in writing, acting, music, action sequences, or anything else.\r Writing: If I had taken a drink every time there was a dramatic pause followed by some God-awful, stupid line, I might have given this review a higher score on account of being too inebriated to catch all the uninspired writing and nonsensical plot filler that littered the last half of the movie.\r Acting: With how long this movie is, and with how much filler they squeezed in, it’s amazing to me that it never seemed like anyone had time to properly deliver a line of dialogue. Everything felt rushed. Questions bled into answers as if the characters knew what would be said before it was said. The emotions of the characters seemed either non-existent or so over the top that the viewer could not possibly relate.\r Music: I didn’t notice it until the very end when I thought, “There’s music playing, isn’t there?” Any LotR fan knows this is a bad thing.\r Action Sequences: These were my least favorite parts of the movie, and they took up about half of the time. I love a good action sequence when it’s done right. However, these are not. Half of the action was silly and cheesy, and the other half was boring (not quite half, actually, because I properly liked one bit of action: when that dwarf did a barrel roll, if you know what I mean). It was always predictable. “Predictable? That’s the nature of a prequel!” I hear you scream. Well then tell the writers to get the action over with fast so we can focus on, say, caring about the characters.\r Anything Else: Smaug was stupid; he looked cliche-dragon, sounded cliche-deep-voice, and acted like an enemy in a bad action movie (coincidence???). The movie strayed far from the book. I mean, I’m not the sort to bad-mouth a movie because it’s different from the book, but I am one to bad-mouth a movie that ruins everything it touches in the book. Which in this case is everything.",

If you have not read the book, it's probably worth a 6 or 7 (and shame on you).  If you have read the book, you might feel that I am being too generous.  I believe that the screen writers MAY have heard of J. R. R. Tolkien from a friend or something.  The relationship ends there.  I can only hope that this series of movies will be remade by someone who actually cares about the story instead of the almighty dollar.  I spent the entire second half of the movie shaking my head, muttering,\"No, no, no!  That didn't happen like that!\"  The only movies I have seen that butchered their source material this badly were Eragon and Kubrick's version of The Shining.",

Its predecessor suffered a bit because it couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a scene-for-scene retelling of the novel or a looser, action-oriented adaptation. This film resides firmly in the second camp, and everything works better for it. For example, the escape from the Woodland Realm is every bit as over the top as the last film's escape from Goblin-town, but it doesn't feel so out of place, so it's easier just to kick back and enjoy the ride. The changes from the book once again mostly work, and in this case actually make more sense. Bard the Bargeman might not be as awesome as Bard the Bowman, at least not yet, but he is much more fleshed out, and the film finally gives the Company a decent reason for needing a burglar. I could have done without the dwarf-dragon battle at the end, I really liked the addition of Tauriel.\r My biggest objection continues to be the over-reliance on CGI. Make no mistake, the Smaug of the title is every bit as incredible as I ever imagined he could be, but decision to animate Azog's son doesn't work out so well. I understand that it was a late decision to give what was originally a live performance a computer makeover, and it shows in how unrealistic he looks next to Daddy.\r Overall, this is another fine addition to Jackson's Middle-earth saga, expanding on the previous film while avoiding its pacing pitfalls.",

This is a much more action packed movie than its predecessor, featuring an intense giant spider attack sequence in Mirkwood Forest, a thrilling river barrel chase sequence as the dwarves attempt to escape from Elvish captors, an intense battle between Gandalf and Sauron, and a non-stop battle with the Dragon Smaug at the end.  As is to be expected, all technical credits are first rate, from the often brilliant special effects, to the stirring Howard Shore musical score, to the excellent use of High Frame Rate 3D.  In addition, the film delivers some outstanding acting, with particularly good performances from Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins and Luke Evans as a well-developed and sympathetic Bard the Bowman.  It is also great to see Orlando Bloom’s Legolas back in action, and despite the initial controversy, the addition of Evangilne Lilly as the female elf warrior Tauriel is a welcome addition, even if she does not appear in the book.  The crowning achievement of the movie, however, is the Dragon Smaug (the best dragon ever portrayed on the silver screen) and his initial reveal in the ancient kingdom of Erebor is absolutely perfect.  This is followed by an Indiana Jones style climax that ends in a real cliffhanger that might irritate some.  For me it just means that the final movie, “The Hobbit: There And Back Again” will launch with an absolutely incredible action sequence.  Like “The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers”, “Desolation” does not really have a beginning or an end, but like that brilliant movie, it is definitely one hell of a middle.",

Firstly, a few niggles that I want to get off my chest. I keep seeing reviewers comparing the Hobbit trilogy with the Lord of the Rings. While this is logically understandable, it should by no means factor into the Hobbit trilogy reviews. Why? Because firstly the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings have two distinctly different feels to them, both in terms of the movies and the books. The Hobbit is supposed to be more colorful, fantasy orientated and vivid than the later more darker Lord of the Rings.  And so it is saddening to see that people use the Lord of the Rings, despite the stark contrast in the concepts, as a benchmark/basis to justify low ratings.\r Which is why when I entered the cinema, and just as I sat down now to review this movie I try to dispel all the bias and judgments that may affect me beforehand. The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug was more exciting, action packed and energetic when compared to the first film, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. While the first film served to introduce the characters, set the pace of the film and slowly familarise the audience; it was expected that  TDoS (The Desolation of Smaug) would quicken the tempo and pace, and by God it did just that! Fans of the first film will enjoy and welcome the countless fight scenes that are magical, well choreographed and don't feel over the top. If I had to pick one aspect of the film that I would of liked more, I probably would have liked to have seen more comical moments. Again, it is understandable why there were fewer comical laughs than the first film; mainly because of the quicker pace of the film, and the darker subplot; which meant that an excess of comedy would have made the sense of urgency prevalent throughout the film seem unrealistic.\r Benedict Cumberbatch as the voice of Smaug was brilliant. Sinister, yet somehow I found myself sympathising with the dragon when he retold his version of events that led to him occupying the Lonely Mountain.\r While the first film lacks action and pace, it ultimately reinforces the need for character introduction. While the second film lacks the slower pace of the first film, it is squashed by the sheer speed of which this film moves at. Even the introduction to the movie, felt as though a sense of urgency was needed. Again, this is not a negative considering the fact the film is based through the middle/second half of the book.\r Overall, brilliant film, didn't lose its way.... Slower in some scenes, but not necessary a bad aspect!\r 9/10.",

This movie was definitely a step down from every other movie in middle earth so far. The cinematography was gorgeous and there were a lot of really great shots. However the movie really falters in the way that it was adapted. If you liked the book for it's humor, lovable characters and charm you will e sorely disappointed. The lighthearted essence of a childrens book is gone in order to make it much darker. Also there is an incredible amount of filler, and to make time for the filler they cut or dramatically altered the actual content from the book. My last complaint is about legolas, why was he in the movie at all? It ruins any tension involved in those scenes because you know hes going to make it, before seeing the movie i thought his involvement would be a short cameo at most, maybe something to do with Gollum. No instead he is one of the central characters in the film. Overall i would say that this movie was disapointing as a LotR fan but a well shot movie with some good cgi and action sequences.",

The best scenes in my opinion were near the end and the scenes between Killi and the She-Elf. In my opinion, there was a bit too much CGI, I much prefer real sets but for the Orcs the CGI was perfect because it felt like they were actually fighting monsters not just men dressed up as monsters. The Orcs were perfect in my opinion, just a shame they have too much elven language, I much prefer the Orcs to act stupid and speak english than speak in this poetic manner, okay it's fine for the white orc because he's badass but his little grunts should speak english. The CGI, although a lot of it, was probably the best I've seen in a film, it really allowed the filmmakers to create more of a fantasy world instead of just showing us New Zealand, which isn't bad by the way. I found it thoroughly entertaining but The Hobbit works and flows best when it's just trying to be its own film. When you clearly hear lines and jokes copied from LOTR it's kind of cringey, they don't need to please  LOTR fans they need to just clear their heads and focus on the story at hand. Either way, great film just hopefully for the next film we'll see more real sets and action sequences in places like Helm's Deep, like an out door set, they're so cool.",

Unlike with the LotR, where major character changes were made and major plot elements were twisted, almost everything is spot on in the Hobbit movies. For this reason they are far better than the LotR movies, and the second one better than the first.\rIt is full of action, great characters, tremendous effects, sound and design, with crisp dialogue, most of which is directly from the book.. Smaug himself is a particular highlight, with perfect voice acting.\rIf there are any flaws they all stem from Franny Walsch`s peculiar obsession with inserting female characters into the story where none exist. The attempted love story between the entirely made up female elf and one of the dwarves was cringe-worthy and easily the low point of the movie.\rI would ignore reviewers on this, as I would with all of Peter Jackson`s movies. From the first release of Bad Taste they have either failed to get his sense of humor, or failed to understand which story it is he is telling in his Middle Earth movies. It has never been just The Hobbit, since this would be an under narrated, simplistic children`s book with loads of silly songs and which would tell none of the story of what is going on in the background, which is all available in notes, appendixes and in Silmarillion.\rEven Tolkien regarded the story of the rise of Sauron as the real story, and he tried to rewrite The Hobbit to include this but gave it up. Still \"reviewers\" to a man whine over the scenes where Gandalf uncovers this as \"distracting\" and \"unnecessary\"  and even that they have been included \"only to stretch the movies into three parts\".\rI can`t imagine being so ignorant.

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nTHE DESOLATION OF SMAUG is a monumental failure on just about every level; storytelling, character development, SFX and even acting. It wheezes, aimlessly, through a CGI heavy landscape via pointless camera moves, pointless situations, pointless characters and some of the worst sets/make-up I've seen in a modern Hollywood picture. The sets look fake, one shot leaves you gawking at the heavily applied foundation on Bilbo's face, the weave of wigs and stick-on facial hair, all distracting from the already distracting and shambolic plot falling apart before your eyes over the three hour running time.\r Jackson has discovered a new love of violence in TDOS  here, violence is cool and sexy. It all plays out like a computer game revenge fantasy of some lonely Tolkien freak. Heads are lopped off, Elves kill like superhero's in a perverse ballet of sadistic machismo and Orcs look like fetish pain-freaks (a bizarre mash up of flesh and metal). And the gratuitous pornography of violence builds and builds throughout the picture, as if Jackson can't get enough of killing. And killing everything in the sexiest, coolest, physically amazing way imaginable.\r Let's not dwell on that, however. Most things can be forgiven if one is hooked into an involving, emotive story of which TDOS has not. Bilbo  our eyes and way into Middle Earth  takes back seat as a ludicrous love triangle plays out with a porky looking Legolas, a dwarf I can't even remember from the first part and another female Elf called Tauriel. If only the love triangle was between the dwarf and Legolas  with Tauriel side-lined  it might have worked!\r The plot for TDOS is atrocious. That it is the 2nd part of an unnecessary trilogy is no excuse (The Two Towers is magnificent). Events just happen for no real reason. Characters are introduced and their back story crammed into a few moments and we are expected to care for their plight. The careful time and effort put into Part 1 of The Hobbit (yes, I liked it) is thrown out of the window for one meaningless set-piece after another. Eventually, we get to the mountain and Bilbo  finally  has something to do, other than kill things, cut ropes, slip on the Ring and vanish now and again. He solves an important puzzle, he slips into the lair of Smaug and, briefly, the film comes alive.\r The conversation between Bilbo and Smaug works brilliantly. The CGI has obviously gone into this behemoth and the lack of music and overkill ramps up the tension a mere two hours into the movie. And then, it is gone. Smaug becomes a dunce, unable to kill anything within six foot of his snout. There is also a ridiculous 'plan' set in motion by the dwarves, involving hot gold and furnaces and, blah, blah, blah... They leap around like acrobats (everybody does in this film) and concoct the most inept counter attack on a dragon ever staged. So ridiculously complex it would make Dr Evil blush. So easily brushed aside, it makes the preceding 20 minutes of acrobatics pointless. And that sums up everything about this movie. It is pointless trash. All padding with no serious regard for story telling or character development. It just wants 'moments' of cool killing and violence. The entire film is a miserable, boring, tedious, violent, unlikable and cynical exercise in making money. It's the very worst Middle Earth film. It's quite possibly one of the worst films ever made, full stop.",

Como diretor ele conseguiu renovar seus tempos de glória que duraram dos filmes trash até King Kong. O filme foi repleto de truques de fotografia sensitiva (como naquelas cenas do diálogo ente Bilbo e Smaug onde ele simula a visão do espectador como se ele estivesse dentro do salão em Erebor) combinados com o 3d magnífico só visto em Avatar e efeitos visuais tão realistas e inéditos  totalmente o oposto de Uma Jornada Inesperada. Houveram alguns erros de fotografia que me fizeram pensar que Jackson estava menos inspirado ao dirigir (um deles foi numa cena da invasão dos orcs em Esgaroth em que o Legolas mata um orc e na hora da facada ele simplesmente foi empurrado para fora da tela), mas esses aconteceram em um período tão curto de tempo que nem mesmo eu sei como reparei. O roteiro foi maravilhoso, aquela discussão do Bilbo e do Smaug foi uma obra prima do Peter Jackson, assim como vários diálogos vistos em As Duas Torres e o episódio Adivinhas no Escuro.\rNo aspecto técnico o filme sai quase perfeito (não quero deixar muitos spoilers sobre a emboscada armada pelos anões nas minas da montanha, mas aquelas partículas líquidas de ouro e água foram um avanço enorme para efeitos especiais), mas para um fã de Tolkien as muitas alterações foram o bastante pra te deixar cheio de pensamentos mistos sobre o filme.\rEu achei a ideia de cobrir as missões do Gandalf maravilhosa! Uma alteração que não feriu a história, pois seria muito importante anos após o arco que cobre o romance e ao mesmo tempo era algo que todos os fãs desejavam ver como aconteceu. SPOILER: Ver o Sauron dialogando chegou a ser assustador, na história do Anel ele não teve muita participação em primeiro plano, como eu digo: \"ele estava lá, não aqui, mas ao mesmo tempo estava aqui e lá\". Vamos ver que rumo essa \"adição\" terá ano que vem.\rSobre a inclusão da Tauriel, não fui um daqueles que ficaram de birra com a adição dela na história, mas o papel que ela teve foi o que marcou o filme todo, PJ infelizmente quis colocar uma pitada de romance adolescente e enfiou isso guela abaixo no plot, isso foi uma blasfêmia  obra de Tolkien, que desejava sempre que a história fosse mais racional possível. O filme atingia um certo clímax e ele era cortado pra cara de sonsa dela (não que a atriz seja ruim, mas o papel)... sério, até as cenas de Dol Goldur e Erebor eram cortadas pra cara dela.\rParece que os episódios da casa de Beorn e da Floresta das Trevas foram cortados pela metade só pra mostrar o romance meia boca \"Kiliel\" ou \"Taurikili\" que mais parece uma fanfic de Harry Potter.

Gone are the laboured, talky scenes of Hobbit domesticity and much of the lame humour has also been excised. We now have a movie with plenty of action and adventure and one that stands tall and bears comparison to 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. All the series' constants are present including impressive make-up and special visual effects, as well as beautiful Art-Direction and great sound. The film sports boundless energy and some amazing set pieces involving spiders, dragons and Hobbits in barrels. Editing is also much sharper this time out and the wonderful swooping camera shots are very much part of the film's overall style. Aside from an awful supporting performance from Stephen Fry as 'The Master of Lake Town', 'The Desolation of Smaug' really does deliver.

Jackson has completely mangled the books. The original core (a children's book about Bilbo finding his inner Took) has been dumbed down to an action film. Don't get me wrong, the film is extremely well filmed and it's Middle Earth in all its glory, but it's not 'The Hobbit'. Where Jackson would leave out or alter minor details in the original Lord of the Rings trilogy, he's added extra, unnecessary details. Legolas wasn't in the book and neither was Tauriel, not to mention Azog. He has even added material from the Appendix of the Return of the King! The film should have been ONE film without any added details rather than 3 films that are way too full of unnecessary details. The film could be a lot of fun for people that have no idea what the original book is about, but for people that read the book it's a huge dissapointment. I don't think I'll go to the third film, as I can't bear to see what Jackson will turn the Battle of the Five Armies to. Sorry Jackson, but you messed up big time with The Hobbit pt2.

Though Jackson opens the movie, reappearing as his carrot-eating-cameo that bags a few laughs from LOTR movie fans in the theaters; its opening is weak. The movies ending is frustrating for anyone in the audience, but that's just because the films content is so good! The film fails to sustain any real structure so to any viewers who haven't seen the first installment or the LOTR movies, will struggle to follow the plot.\rAlthough this film has its weak points it is a vast improvement on the first, firstly; there is tons more action, gore and evil. Then there's the CGI (best seen in the 3D format) which in this movie has some of the best achievements; Smaug is a masterpiece and is definitely worth the wait, and the orcs are truly brought to life when seen in 3D. Though there are some parts of the movie that have clearly been weakly written, this fresh take on evil and hatred festering in MiddleEarth outweighs these few flaws and gives Tolkien  fans and Christmas cinema-goers what they need to restore their love for MiddleEarth on the big screen.\rLook out for the spider scene in Mirkwood; for anyone who has read the book, they will realize how hard it must have been to write that scene with the spiders talking. For people who hadn't read the book this scene could have turned out to appear a little cheesy but Jackson and his team have succeeded and made the scene work better than any other in the movie!\rStronger writing and this movie could have been up there with 11 Academy Award winning, Return of the King...the film is satisfying; full of action, plenty of fantastic CGI eye-candy and a good performance from the entire cast.\r8 out of 10, now wait for There    and Back    Again.",

Nope, not talking about the dragon. I mean the movie.\r Book differences aside (I didn't go to the theater with expectations of watching a remake of the book's second third chapters), the plot was terrible. And I mean, TERRIBLE with a capital T and the rest of the word capitalized as well.\r For starters, there was a time gap between where we left in the first movie and where the second started. Sure, I'm used to it and it can be good for the movie. But it doesn't explain how the orcs have caught up with them. Secondly, there was almost no Beorn. He doesn't even have many lines. What's the point of adding him into the movie if he's not gonna do anything? Thirdly, adding Legolas would have made sense just to connect with The Lord of the Rings, like Jackson wants, but adding another elf, Tauriel, and making them be the entire piece of action in the film was really lousy. There was almost no plot because of the large bits of action from Legolas and Tauriel. If I wanted to watch an action movie I would have bought tickets for another movie.\r Also, the movie relies heavily in 3D. It's like Jackson forgot about the plot, just to make it coincide with awesome 3D effects (which I can't watch because I'm from the unlucky group of people who can't watch 3D movies because of sight conditions). 3D should be just an additive to the movie, not the whole point of it.\r Adding Dol Guldur and the return of Sauron was a nice touch though, and the Bard the Bowman portrayal was awesome. That adds a few points to the score. However, Evangeline Lilly can't act, which substracts points. And making the action parts so long I almost fell asleep. They should be brief and scattered across the film. Not concentrated during an hour and a half and then abandoned and changed for pure dialogue.\r All in all, this makes this movie the worst Jackson Middle Earth movie yet, and it was the one I had most hopes about. I liked the first one more than this and it's really slow.\r I was about to give this a 5, like acceptable, but then I got to the cliffhanger. Really, Jackson? Why didn't you give closure to the arc? You have a war brewing, you don't need to keep Smaug alive. Let Bard gun him down already and get this over with. You could have ended the movie with the party at Esgaroth, and then changing to a scene showing the army marching. You have A LOT of stuff to put in the next film without leaving Smaug's closure to be exploited.\r All in all, this was the worst of the three. I really do believe the worst is behind us. Come on, Jackson. Give it a worthy ending.",
