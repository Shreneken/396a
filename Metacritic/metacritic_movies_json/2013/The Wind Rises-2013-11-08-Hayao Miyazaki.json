Nearsighted from a young age and thus unable to become a pilot, Jiro joins the aircraft division of a major Japanese engineering company in 1927. His genius is soon recognized, and he grows to become one of the world’s most accomplished airplane designers. The film chronicles much of his life, and depicts key historical events that deeply affected the course of Jiro’s life, including the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, the Great Depression, the tuberculosis epidemic and Japan’s plunge into war. He meets and falls in love with Nahoko, and grows and cherishes his friendship with his colleague Honjo. A tremendous innovator, Jiro leads the aviation world into the future. Miyazaki pays tribute to engineer Jiro Horikoshi and author Tatsuo Hori in his creation of the fictional character Jiro—the center of the epic tale of love, perseverance, and the challenges of living and making choices in a turbulent world.… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The film is visually sumptuous, morally ambiguous, dramatic and dreamlike, with a narrative as engrossing as any live-action movie of 2013. It’s easy to follow yet hard to shake.",
    "This is a gorgeous production, even by Miyazaki's standards.",
    "Miyazaki offers a vivid, at times fantastical view of Japan between the wars, wracked by the Great Depression, a fearsome earthquake that leveled Tokyo in 1923, a tuberculosis epidemic and the rise of fascism.",
    "To see The Wind Rises is to simultaneously marvel at the work of a master and regret that this film is likely his last.",
    "Even if Hayao Miyazaki's career is complete, a work like this serves to remind us of the shining beacons he's left behind him, the testaments to pursuing beauty in the face of so much ugliness, themselves lasting reminders of the quiet rewards of determination.",
    "Miyazaki is at the peak of his visual craftsmanship here, alternating lush, boldly colored rural vistas with epic, crowded urban canvases, soaring aerial perspectives and test flights both majestic and ill-fated.",
    "As gorgeously animated as any of his previous movies, Wind has Miyazaki trading in his more fantastical impulses for contemplative, old-fashioned drama and period detail.",
    "It might not be the director's most immediately accessible films, but it's among his most fascinating and beguiling.",
    "A work of immense mystery and strangeness, loaded with unforgettable images, spectacular sweeps of color and nested, hidden meanings. It feels to me like a meditative epic about Japan’s traumatic journey into modernity, and a complicated allegory about the innocence, arrogance and culpability of artists. It’s one of the most beautiful animated films ever made, and something close to a masterpiece.",
    "It is vigorous, subtle, thematically daring, visually gorgeous.",
    "A very honest film from a great Japanese artist.",
    "It speaks to both the head and the heart, and it is, in myriad ways, some of the best work the legendary animator has ever created.",
    "A movie that takes the hallmarks of a great career and elevates them to new heights. In terms of tone, visual beauty, and storytelling, The Wind Rises represents Miyazaki at the apex of his abilities.",
    "If The Wind Rises falls a bit short in regard to historical drama, however, it’s still a Miyazaki movie, meaning he casts the same magically beautiful spell.",
    "Should you see it? Of course you should. Anything Miyazaki does is worth your time. But the movie’s a gorgeous, problematic anomaly in an illustrious career.",
    "It's a big story, and in this landmark film Miyazaki is up to every demand. Sit back and behold.",
    "It makes the dream of flight itself a vehicle for bittersweet enchantment.",
    "His movie is visually as beautiful as anything he’s ever done. Conceptually, it’s muddled. The collision between poetic fancifulness and grim reality, between peace and war, never falls into focus. Miyazaki has seized on a great theme only to soft-pedal it.",
    "The grim subtext of The Wind Rises goes largely unacknowledged, leading to a gaping hole in this otherwise beautifully realized narrative that celebrates the power of curiosity as a motivating force.",
    "Unlike many of Miyazaki's previous works, The Wind Rises is a film rooted far more firmly in realism. Although it does have its fair share of fantastical dream sequences and magical flying machines.",
    "While Miyazaki’s two-hour-long, historical-melodrama swansong is destined to be his most divisive film yet, it is also his most adult and interesting, and never less than visually breathtaking throughout.",
    "he beauty of The Wind Rises — and it really is gorgeous — does not mask the troublesome aspects of its story, or of human nature itself.",
    "It’s romantic, tragic, and inexorably strange.",
    "Though it’s just slightly over two hours long, The Wind Rises has the historical sweep of a David Lean picture, complete with panoramic shots of migrating populations against a background of disaster and a romantic orchestral score by Miyazaki’s longtime musical collaborator, Joe Hisaishi.",
    "What's on screen is a gorgeous grab bag of notions: ardent love, a salute to Thomas Mann's \"The Magic Mountain,\" a bit of \"Camille\" and a lot — I mean a lot — of nuts-and-bolts stuff about nuts and bolts.",
    "Mr. Miyazaki renders Jiro’s life and dreams with lyrical elegance and aching poignancy.",
    "An emotionally generous and expansively detailed romantic fantasy.",
    "There are visual flights of fancy here as glorious as anything Miyazaki’s studio has created, but the story is rooted in a country trudging towards its own destruction.",
    "Wind is both benign and ominous.",
    "The work is more muted than Miyazaki’s more fantastical films, but visually complex and gorgeous, from the rustic mountain scenes to the urban scenes and soaring aerial views.",
    "Of Miyazaki’s many gifts as a filmmaker, perhaps the most subtle is the way he honors time and silence and stillness, values that are in lamentably short supply in most modern-day productions.",
    "Miyazaki is arguably at the Kubrick/Polanski level, where his lesser films still yield great rewards. Even during the moments that don't soar, The Wind Rises continues to satisfy.",
    "The Wind Rises was a dream project for the great Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki, and this gorgeous film makes a fine capstone for his career.",
    "Jiro is a thoughtful engineer and a romantic, not a soldier. And The Wind Rises conveys the visual poetry of its titular reference.",
    "While the film’s individual moments and images are often fantastically wrought, the story elements often seem as unintegrated as the moral exegesis.",
    "While The Wind Rises isn’t top-shelf Miyazaki, it features more than enough gorgeous imagery to make his loss feel acute. Studio Ghibli will surely continue without him, but it’ll never be the same.",
    "Typically lovely to look at, with big-eyed young people espousing high ideals amid natural splendor. But outside of their bubble, a prickly history looms, and Miyazaki’s dubious attitude toward the wartime role of his hero makes the movie a mixed blessing.",
    "Does The Wind Rises represent Miyazaki at the top of his game? No, not really. But it could be Miyazaki at the end of the game, and that alone is reason enough to appreciate the film for the things it offers rather than hammer it too hard for the things it lacks.",
    "The movie’s spell is solid, even if it doesn’t soar to the heights it could.",
    "Jiro’s genius is godlike, but his personality is nonexistent; time is too-briskly spanned, then ground into blow-by-blow melodrama.",
    "A gorgeous yet ultimately frustrating tribute to the Japanese airplane designer Jiro Horikoshi."

This is unlike most Miyazaki movies, as it is far deeper and more \"adult\" than most of his other films.  It still has a light hearted, and stunning art style. It also has themes and messages, regarding World War 2, and lays out these messages very subtly. This movie wont be for everyone, since it is not traditional Miyazaki fare. However, this movie should not go unseen. Miyazaki's final film is something you will ponder for a long while.",

The graphics contained“”The Wind Rises” is an animated feature written and directed by the acclaimed Japanese illustrator, Hayao Miyazaki. This is Mr. Miyazaki’s last animated film and, indeed, the filmgoing community is the lesser for it. The graphics contained in this film are breathtaking and as beautiful to view as one can imagine. The film tells the life story of one of the world’s greatest aircraft engineers, Jiro Hurikushi, as it follows his career as a near sighted boy who dreams of flying but, because of his poor eyesight, is forced to vicariously enjoy his passion by designing airplanes instead, The film chronicles Mr. Hurikushi’s life through Japan’s great earthquake in the early 20th Century, the massive tuberculosis epidemic and its great depression and is as enlightening as it is entertaining. The film is offered on two different screens, one with the original dialogue (with English subtitles) and the other with the English dubbed in. See the technically perfect dubbed in version with actor Joseph Gordon-Lewitt as Jiro and Emily Blunt as Naoko, the love of his life. The movie comes as near to perfect as possible but for one problem. It is too long and looking at my watch during the approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes was a distraction. As has so often been said, when the writer also assumes the role of director, it is like a parent trying to edit out the performances of his children….a difficult task that requires more objectivity than dedication and proves that too much of a good thing necessarily isn’t.  With all of that being said, the film is nevertheless a lovely theatrical viewing experience and one that will be as enjoyable for its adult audience to see as it will be for the children who accompany them. I give the film a rating of 9 as  this cinematic endeavor, like the wind in the title, will take the viewer to new and exciting heights. It is also a fitting farewell to Mr. Miyazaki and his own career as one of the world’s greatest animators.",

It bookends Grave of the Fireflies and reminds us that amidst all the fantastic worlds we've seen from Studio Ghibli, their films and stories are steeped in the sometimes grim foray of reality, this time telling us the story of Dr Jiro Horikoshi, an engineer who revolutionized Japan's aerospace technology. It's a serious piece, half of which takes place in Jiro's mind, but that doesn't make it any less poignant. It's as touching as Mononoke Hime, as dark as Spirited Away, and at times as lighthearted as Howl's Moving Castle. It's a gorgeous film that deserves all the praise it receives.",

Usually, the English dubbing is unnecessarily high-pitched, out of character and lifeless for me; but this one wasn't that bad to be honest.\r As for the story, Miyazaki's works often involve fantastical people and things. Often the fantastical is more important than plot, characterization, logic or continuity. This trend continues here.\r His bone-headed insistence using \"traditional\" hand-drawing also shows its age. He might delude himself into thinking it's meant to evoke that classics film feeling, but I strongly feel otherwise. Having seen crisp and clean animation from Kyoto Animation, Madhouse and A-1 Pictures, I don't have any inkling to use an adjective such as classic; I will use quaint.

We don't get any of the magic of Spirited Away nor the epics of Princess Mononoke - still, what we get is perhaps another strong statement about how animated films are not only meant for children (which is something already well assessed in Japan).\r The visuals are incredible as always, more beautiful than any CGI could create, but we're sort of left questioning ourselves why Miyazaki has chosen for his last film such a radical change of direction as regarding themes. Nevertheless, turning a figure like the protagonist's (he could look like a war criminal to many) into a dreamer who \"only wanted to create something beautiful\" is a bold move, and at least it has purpose. Don't forget that Miyazaki's previous themes (environment, communion with nature, and, especially in Howl's Moving Castle, hatred for war) should act as a deterrent for those who think this movie glorifies war. At most it glorifies Japan.\r I'm just sad this was a swansong. Let's hope he thinks twice and gets back to drawing.

I was totally heart broke when I heard it is Mr. Miyazaki's final movie. Then I was thoroughly prepared to enjoy every piece of it and indeed I did. What a great piece of work as being in his 70s, definitely a farewell masterpiece. A most matured movie, I mean for the first time a movie for grownups that had contents children won't fit in to enjoy from the studio as well from the director.\r It was just like the movie 'The Aviator'. A boy, Jiro Horikoshi, who aspires to contribute his skills to upgrade the aircraft technology who was actually inspired by the Italian aircraft designer Caproni. At his young age, he excels in the field that leads him to grab an opportunity to work with the nation's most renowned aircraft manufacturer. His life mixed with dreams and reality makes him a better man among his coworker. Everyone believed that he's a workaholic, but he surprises all by falling in love. The movie explained his ambition, passion towards aircrafts and his romantic life as well as the dreams that make him to believe everything is feasible.\r ‘‘Airplanes are beautiful cursed dreams...\rwaiting for the sky to swallow them up’’\r There are very few so far in the history of filmmaking that animation borrowed story from biographies. This was way better than what live shot movie would have offered to the viewers. Especially this story had few dream scenes, like a fantasy that we had seen in 'The Lovely Bones'. Those were really well done, a trademark that usually we find in all of Hayao Miyazaki movies. If you are a fan of his work, then it will be a delightful 2 hour long treat for sure. I had the experience of watching this like watching the final match of the FIFA world cup. I could never ask better than this.\r Kind of inspiring theme about engineering work and a message teller about non-violence. That this movie was set during the world war, including Japan's involvement in the affair. So there were many dialogues that delivers against the idea of war, like, the famous Caproni regrets that his invention was misused in the wars. The movie had lots of smoking scenes, as it sets in and around the 20s that was fine because people did in those times. After all, like I said earlier, it is for adult, even if parents allow their kids to watch they may fall in boredom. So I see there's no controversy to drag on.\r ‘‘Engineers turn dream into reality’’\r There were few sentiments, it appeals strongly during the end portion. The end also leaves lots of questions about what could have happened afterwards, especially Jiro's Romance life. Someway it gives the impression of happy ending and in another way slightly hurts. A finely balanced grand finale. Those were the seconds (the time) I was not desired for because no more Miyazaki's movie to see afterwards. I believed the end of a great era of him and studio Ghibli together. Overall, gives the satisfaction of watching a man's true story, his romantic life, involvement in achieving the dream and got a place in his country's history. Now the director showed it to the rest of the world in a beautiful manner. Thank you  Hayao Miyazaki for all your contributions, I always keep loving your great works. Enjoy your rest of the life.",

Though every single shot is so beautifully designed it's plagued by repetition and overly long sequences.  It covers plenty of historical ground in 172 minutes but not much\remotional ground. Besides his narrative being problematic, the whole ideology is immoral.  The film explicitly makes a case for beauty and design being more important than preventing war and being with your wife in her dying days. Beauty is in fact, very ugly when it is used for destructive purposes, but the film doesn't do much to make this statement. And the man behind the design isn't very interesting.  He lacks personality, and even his imaginative and inspired dreams become repetitive and don't inform much.  Miyazaki doesn't make a very good case for the genius of this man.  I applaud Miyazaki for not being pigeonholed into making the same movie again and again, and he proves to be adventurous even to the end.  But the beauty of the rendered images cannot overshadow very obvious flaws.",

He's moved away from the usual fantastical subject matter to a biography based on the designer of Japan's most lethal fighter planes. The story begins with him as a young boy, whose lyrical dreams depict his obsession with flying. When it follows his plane designer career, the story is interesting. There is a tragic subplot about the love of his life, which slows down the pacing. Thru it all are Miyazaki's sumptuous visuals: the subtle observations, the stunning landscapes, the exquisite design. Despite the simplistic script (voiced by an impressive list of American actors) and the +2hr length, this film offers a dazzling look at an innovative and magical master at work.",

Absolutely awesome movie. 2 hour run time, but it could have lasted days with how detailed and well crafted it was. There's not really much I can say about it, other than the fact that in my opinion, Miyazaki could not have ended his amazing feat of magical films in a better and more peaceful way than the utterly powerful thoughts and feelings brought about by his final work of art that is The Wind Rises. He has said goodbye in a realistic, and almost unnoticeable, yet very calm and respectful way. When this man passes away, the universe will kiss him goodbye, and his legacy of majesty and utterly complete understanding of the innocence of human curiosity, of all curiosity, the factor that lets us believe in magic as children, and love others as ourselves, will always be remembered by someone, and this legacy will always eventually be implemented in all of existence by some sentient being, merely because it is able, and any sentient beings will, at one point or another, experience and understand this legacy. Beauty.  I would also like to express the sorrow that I feel for any others that have loved other Miyazaki films, such as My Neighbor Tortoro or Spirited Away.

WithoutAfter being slightly disappointed by Howl's Moving Castle, I became a little worried lest Spirited Away is the last film in which Hayao Miyazaki managed to balance between telling a cohesive story and conveying passionate feelings. Without seeing 2008's Ponyo, I can gladly say that all my worries were for naught.Of course, It's essentially a biopic. And its moments of fantasy are only dreams and visions. But that doesn't mean that this made it an easier task for Miyazaki to prove that he hasn't lost his magic touch. That also in no way means that this film lacks the sense of wonder and the mesmerising animation Miyazaki's works are known for. IMHO, this is one of his most beautiful films, and one of the most beautiful animated films in general.Sure, this film could have simplified what concerns aeronautics to make this part more appealing to those who have no interest in such thing (like me). Also, it could have took more risks to differentiate itself from other biopics. But then again, I have these issues because I consider this a solid biopic, not an inspirational animated film.When it comes to the romance aspect of the film, it's safe to say that The Wind Rises has one of the most touching love stories I've witnessed in any animated feature. The conditions the lovers experience play a major part here; how their relationship has been established and develops throughout the film is what made this romance nearly on par with WALL·E's (only considering it's also an animated film).You may have noticed how much I identified with the characters. Actually, Jirô Horikoshi became one of my favourite Miyazaki characters alongside Chihiro and Totoro.All in all, The Wind Rises is a top-tierMiyazaki that was begging not to be his swan song. Miyazaki's latest work is also, surprisingly, his most mature.(8.5/10)",

Animation aside, it is a drama, a fictionalised biopic drama. It covers themes such as love, passion (in a non-sexual way) hope and determination (to succeed).I like the detail in the animation - the animation itself is quite charming in being 2D based, like most Studio Ghibli films are but I've always liked and enjoyed this. I feel that such films have more authenticity to them somehow, whereas CGI technology tends to seem, or feel, quite a bit artificial and slap dash. I like that characters are shown in quite a lot of detail, with them shown to run from place to place at certain times for example - the detail in the animation is good and makes it seem surprisingly realistic yet obviously not artificial. I like that shadows are well animated - lots of fairly small seeming details are well portrayed. There are some surprising scenes which feature extremes of colour, with bright yellow and oranges shining brightly against the white of the cloudy sky. There are also beautifully colourful sunsets and the like - I thought the quality of the animated visuals was really very impressive. I also noticed the sound effects are quite detailed as well, with the sound of individual foot steps being clearly audible at times and even the sound of the wind itself via bushes and trees blowing in said wind  etc. I felt its quite an indulgent film in a way (such as the visuals/animation and the themes) but I genuinely mean that in a good sense. I felt it was quite an engrossing film, with me enjoying following Jiro's life. The plot is a bit confusing in parts, in terms of establishing which scenes are set during a dream and which are actually reality and in terms of the chronology. I noticed the film makes good use of a classical soundtrack, including some light and airy pieces that go well with positive scenes, when Jiro is in his element and as the old saying goes 'daring to dream'. I thought that the good use of the classical pieces combined with the impressive use of perhaps slightly old fashioned 2D animation and moreso the attention to detail it featured, really made it quite charming and a very enjoyable watch. I should perhaps point out that there are some moments of peril present in the plot - plot wise its not all happy as such, although I won't go in to any details so as not to provide any potential spoilers but suffice to say that the film features both joyously optimistic, dreamy type sequences and scenes of a war setting, in a much more uncertain time. I suppose it could be quite thought provoking in a sense, although currently I prefer to watch films for the escapism side of things nowadays.As far as content is concerned, there is relatively little likely to scare or particularly offend people, although there are some scenes depicting natural disasters and war - one features a relatively long drawn out natural event, in which many tens of citizens are shown fleeing. I suppose this could disturb or frighten very young children. There is little in the way of direct violence shown on screen, although there are scenes featuring war planes clearly visible but people with injuries aren't really shown or certainly not in much detail anyway. The closest equivalent is when an illness becomes widespread and people obviously suffer from it, the depiction of which could seem a bit harrowing for young kids.Also, I noticed Jiro is shown smoking in various scenes, which may put some parents off showing their children it but to be honest its probably more of an adults film in a sense - not in terms of the content but in terms of the length (it being just slightly over 2 hours long) and the historical context of the plot, I'm not sure if young kids would stay interested in it right to the very end. I very much enjoyed watching this - I couldn't help but feel like the film was very well made, featuring a good mix of both endearing animation and a lovely classical music soundtrack score.",
