  "critic_reviews": [
    "Schrader tries to find the human side of it all, and he scores with Lohan, who taps a vulnerability beneath her dissolution to remind you why she's still a movie star.",
    "You’d have to go back to the ’80s to find a film with this jaded a view of Hollywood, a town where every aspiring actor knows every yoga instructor who knows every producer and they all swap partners and dance. Constantly.",
    "As a visual symphony, The Canyons is often masterful, and while it may be pornographic in places, it’s never campy. At the center of its cold, beautiful and half-dead world is the almost incandescent Lindsay Lohan, burning like a flawed diamond.",
    "People who don't understand movies often speak of them as escapism, a kind of passive fantasy. Lohan's performance in The Canyons, so naked in all ways, is the ultimate retort to that kind of idiocy: To watch it is to live in the moment.",
    "The major exception is Lohan, who gives one of those performances, like Marlon Brando’s in “Last Tango in Paris,” that comes across as some uncanny conflagration of drama and autobiography. Lohan may not go as deep or as far as Brando, but with her puffy skin, gaudy hoop earrings and thick eye makeup, there’s a little-girl-lost quality to the onetime Disney teen princess that’s very affecting.",
    "The Canyons is actually anything but gratuitously sensational. On the contrary, it’s rather restrained, even conservative affair, far more interested in expositional conversation and a sustained tone of bleached-out melancholy than cranking up the heat.",
    "The Canyons has all the elegance and depth of a daytime soap opera, peppered with flashes of name brand nudity for a tantalizing hook. It’s a slog.",
    "The Canyons may not work, and the sex (as well as the synthesized glop on the soundtrack) may be tragically unhip, but it was made by a director who still cares.",
    "The Canyons is a sleazy soap opera that fails primarily because it gives us no one to care about and no reason why we should be interested that we don't care.",
    "If Schrader and Ellis set out to prove that movies are dying or already dead, they might have done their job too well. The Canyons doesn’t play like the cure for a moribund industry, so much as a mildly effective, highly depressing administration of the last rites.",
    "In The Canyons, there’s no pleasure — only power struggles disguised as sex.",
    "The Canyons comes across as a desperate gambit for relevance by a group of artists who want to reinvent themselves but don't know how. Fittingly, that's the theme of the film itself.",
    "Despite a liberal dose of full frontal nudity, The Canyons fails to fully revel in its sleaze, struggling to even work as a deadpan satire on the kind of vacuous and deadened Hollywood types Easton Ellis brought to life in the pages of his debut novel, Less Than Zero.",
    "The Canyons has more in common with Schrader’s opulent immoral tableaux “The Comfort of Strangers,” “Auto Focus” and “The Walker” than with his other work (including the script for “Taxi Driver”). It’s weaker than those, though, and less biting.",
    "With The Canyons, [Mr. Schrader] tries to get at something real under all the hard, glossy surfaces, but ends up caught in the divide between the movie that he seems to have wanted to make and the one he did.",
    "The Canyons is not porn, but it has the demoralized second-rateness and the lowlife inanity of the porn world.",
    "Instead of commenting on the vapidity of the film industry, Paul Schrader's miscast, poorly executed and utterly soulless drama is an example of the failing art form it seeks to indict. Though it has real ideas, Schrader and his team never manage to put them into action.",
    "Paul Schrader, the once-brilliant screenwriter of such films as “Taxi Driver” and “Raging Bull,” has fashioned a movie that seems to exist to be repugnant. Maybe that’s the point; it was written by Bret Easton Ellis. Nearly every character in this movie is unlikable.",
    "The Canyons is a bad accident everyone saw coming, and now it is here.",
    "The Canyons isn’t just bad, it’s rank — and it takes a peculiar sort of integrity to denude the frame of life to the point where it smells to heaven.",
    "Judging from the lack of care that went into making this one, I'm not so sure how much Schrader cares about the movies anymore either.",
    "Far from the renegade, boundary-pushing, sexually explicit sensation that its makers have been suggesting, The Canyons is a lame, one-dimensional and ultimately dreary look at peripheral Hollywood types not worth anyone's time either onscreen or in real life.",
    "The Canyons is billed as an erotic thriller, but the sexcapades of these empty-headed twentysomethings are far more likely to elicit yawns than titillation.",
    "Maybe the joke’s on us, and all the pre-release hype suggesting that a micro-budget train wreck was barreling our way was merely part of the marketing strategy.",
    "Stephen Rodrick's New York Times article about the making of The Canyons had humor, suspense and propulsion. They should have made that movie. What we have here is dead on arrival.",
    "The cavernous emptiness of The Canyons cannot sustain itself, and it makes for a mostly flat, strained and uninvolving experience (not helped by the pace which makes 90 minutes, feels like a sluggish two hours).",
    "She (Lohan) isn’t the best thing about this awful, lounged-out drama — it has no best thing — but in her defense, Lohan has been atrociously directed, allowed to get away with the worst aspects of her vocal-fry laziness, and trotted out like a symbolic objet d’art.",
    "The best acting in The Canyons is done by the porn star. That might be all you need to know about this film, which is the kind of vapid, self-consciously artsy, waste-of-time movie that might never have seen the light of day (or the dark of theater) and would have gone straight to VOD were it not for the triple-threat name-recognition trio of the actress Lindsay Lohan, the director Paul Schrader and the writer Bret Easton Ellis.",
    "Paul Schrader and Brett Easton Ellis don't have the sense of play this kind of narrative of one-upmanship requires, as we're never allowed to enjoy the characters' misdeeds.",
    "Paul Schrader’s The Canyons is not the worst movie of 2013 — it's marginally better than \"InAPPpropriate Comedy\" and \"Scary Movie 5,\" two even worse bombs that Lindsay Lohan also lent her rapidly diminishing talents to — but it is surely the most boring I’ve seen."

And the worst acting I've ever seen in my life, including the tapes of my mother's wedding. Beaker's puppet without the puppeteer delivers more than \"James Deen\" and Lindsay Lohan combined. When I started watching this, and there was that scene in the beginning, I was laughing my teeth out. But enough with jokes.\r I know it's low budget. It's supposed to be looking the way it is. But that's not where the problems are. When I read that it was Bret Easton Ellis who wrote the script, I thought \"Oh, he's a good writer, it's going to be a good film.\" Then I realised B.E.E. has written the same story for almost thirty years now, in a dozen of different books. So no. The story is bad, the dialogue is not good, the acting is awful, the music is annoying, the visuals are amateur: all the ingredients sum up to a meager 1 out of 10.\r Girls might want to watch this because they rarely get to see full frontal male in cinemas.",

That's the case it seems in The Canyons, a film about deluded young adults who don't know what they want, and won't tell you even by the end of the film. What mostly brings attention to this small indie film is that it brings the official no-joke-I'm-actually-attempting-to-act return of Lindsey Lohan! A brave comeback into the film, alongside porn actor James Deen... Is that a sentence that should ever be spoken? Yes, the film co-stars a well known porn industry actor who takes the name from legendary actor James DEAN. This movie is already harder to review now that it's origins are explained, so let's go forth with the story.\r Lohan plays Tara, a woman who relies on rich douches to take care of her, a lifestyle suddenly becoming boring with her sociopathic trust-fund leech boyfriend Christian, played by Deen. Christian is a so called producer who only uses the title to show his father he's doing something with his life, and is in a open sexual relationship with Tara; allowing other men or women to join in. The main plot comes into focus when Tara reunites with an old boyfriend named Ryan, who is an actor in Christian's upcoming produced film. What happens when this is revealed is nothing more than a cruel game in which Christian suspects the worst and  with both Tara and Ryan's mind. But it isn't all that engaging if any it sounded that way.\r The Canyons is more of a  film. Nothing really happens in the sense of action or thrills! The Canyons relies on suspense and style, of which for style it get's an Grade A+! Much of the cinematography in the film is excellently done and stylized to a tone that almost resembles the seediness and loneliness of it's own characters. Suspense on the other hand is what barely keeps you going throughout most of the film, but for me it seems just enough that I don't really hate it or love it that much either.\r Lohan has a long and I mean LONG way to go if she wants opinions of her acting career to improve, but for now this role seems to suit her perfectly. Trust me, she's no Marlo Brando (who the hell even  made that reference?). The real steal for the film is James Deen's performance as the twisted Christian, who's sexual style and deviance blurs your vision of him much through the story. In conclusion: Style is something only a few films can master perfectly, and this film doesn't master anything, but with mixed performances and characters that warp your view of the world, The Canyons is a must see for people who want to see the absolute darkness that comes from simple people.",

Lindsay's performance is actually quite good. This is a very dark and edgy film and it really allows that side of her persona to flesh out throughout the twisted plot.\r I felt that the movie was well written and directed for a low-budget film. I loved the whole montage of closed cinemas throughout the movie and the way that young spoiled people in Hollywood behave. Lohan plays the role of damaged Tara flawlessly with seemingly little to no effort.\r I feel that nobody should take what the critics say seriously because most of them don't appear to have any taste in films these days. Whatever films they praise, turn out to be mundane dramas with no substance and they curse rare gems like this. Please watch the movie and ignore the negative publicity.",
