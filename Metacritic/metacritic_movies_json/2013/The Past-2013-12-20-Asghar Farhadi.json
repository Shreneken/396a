  "critic_reviews": [
    "With The Past, Farhadi again displays a gift for poking into corners of nondescript lives and discovering unique drama.",
    "Do we ever get the whole truth? Only this: The past is never the past. In Farhadi’s wounding worldview, the past is the present and, most certainly, the future, too.",
    "Many thematic ingredients come together in Farhadi’s rich stew of a story: jealousy, resentment, betrayal, forgiveness, healing. The filmmaker stirs them, with the touch of a master, into a dish that both stimulates and nourishes.",
    "The Past, is hugely ambitious — it's Farhadi seizing his moment — yet it's also a wrenchingly intimate tale of lives torn asunder by forces within and without them.",
    "The Past makes conventional movies feel artificial. Watching the characters interact in this movie feels like \"Here is real life,\" and real life just happens to be strangely compelling.",
    "Another brilliantly mounted drama concerning fracturing families, hidden motives and the difficulties of attaining stability in a rapidly changing world.",
    "The last 30 seconds of the film — wrenching, startling, utterly transformative of everything that precedes them — has haunted me for months. The Past will, I'm guessing, haunt me for years.",
    "Bolstered by performances that convey profound grief and remorse without look-at-me histrionics, The Past is steeped in the believable micro details of its scenario while also expanding to universals.",
    "Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi pursues his exploration of guilt, choice and responsibility in a superbly written, directed and acted drama that commands attention every step of the way.",
    "The film could hardly be less American in tone: It has no villains. It provides complete and comfortable closure for none of its relationships.",
    "The film's final scene, which manages to recontextualize everything we've seen so far with a brilliant simplicity that, if further proof were needed, establishes Farhadi as one of the best storytellers in cinema today.",
    "The result demonstrates that Farhadi, who is cinema’s heir to the likes of Henrik Ibsen and Anton Chekhov, is so deft at ingenious narrative construction and intricate character development that he can make first-rate dramas in any country and/or language he likes.",
    "Farhadi's new movie confirms his unique ability to explore how constant chatter and anguished outbursts obscure the capacity for honest communication.",
    "Farhadi again burrows deep into his characters to tell an achingly intimate story, spinning grand tragedies out of minor lives in which the past lingers in the air, a perfume that haunts long after its wearer has left the room.",
    "As the secrets that almost everyone is hiding slowly but inexorably come to light, Farhadi's gifts as a very specific director, someone who knows exactly how he wants every scene to be played, come to the fore, adding honesty and involvement to a plot that might seem artificial in other hands.",
    "The Past plays out within narrower bounds than \"A Separation,\" and often at lower velocity — a few moments feel almost Chekhovian. Yet the film is commanding in its own right, another exploration of a volatile situation — an estranged husband returning from Iran when his wife requests a divorce — in which flashes of insight or understanding lead to new mysteries.",
    "Farhadi isn’t interested in judging his characters so much as comprehending them in all their complexity, and registering the consequences of their actions, particularly on children.",
    "Unlike \"A Separation\", in which Iranian culture and mores played critical roles, the theme in The Past is more universal and spelled out in the title.",
    "The Past, the new film from Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, is taut, quiet, democratic, observant — a fine meal made with rare and subtle ingredients.",
    "The miracle is that even with a bit of dramaturgical clunkiness The Past is fluid, intimate cinema. Few directors today can shoot in such tightly confined spaces, with such a determined control over his actors' movements, and make the drama work so well.",
    "If The Past doesn’t equal the masterpiece that preceded it, it’s still an exceptional film from a man who is clearly one of the best working directors.",
    "Farhadi's latest film is almost hypnotically compelling, spinning an intricate web of predicaments, emotional reactions and resolutions in a domestic drama that leaves the viewer reeling by its conclusion.",
    "Bejo (The Artist) digs deep into the secrets and lies that have afflicted all her relationships, in a wonderfully affecting film that haunts you long after it ends.",
    "The Past is just about as good as a relationship drama is ever going to get. The plot is teased out with deliberate grace, the performances are sublime and the revelations, even the most melodramatic, feel right and true. It’s big canvas stuff painted by a new master.",
    "The emotional stakes are large-scale, and Farhadi honors them by delving into their intricacies.",
    "A bold, honest film about family life that showcases a terrifically unpeppy turn from Bejo.",
    "It has many of A Separation’s strengths — the acute observation of complex characters in a story that keeps unpacking surprises — but they have become familiar. They lack the revelatory wallop of the first film.",
    "[Farhadi's] gift for pulling us deep into the story, and for conveying the major burdens of these supposedly minor lives, is unimpaired.",
    "The Past is not as nuanced as its predecessor — and not as impactful, either. But this is still far more complex than most family dramas.",
    "The story is nearly obscured by its schematic design (everyone doesn’t just have his or her reasons; he or she is also guilty), but there are mysteries, surprises and complexities, notably in the representation of the children and in Ms. Bejo’s thorny, layered performance with its strata of neediness, resentment and hope.",
    "It’s almost impossible to describe the narrative specifics of The Past without making the movie seem ridiculously hammy. Indeed, several twists involving Samir, a dry cleaner with plenty of his own troubles, tip a bit into hoary melodramatics.",
    "An indelible tapestry of carefully engineered revelations and deeper human truths.",
    "It is an intricate and often brilliant drama, with restrained and intelligent performances; there is an elegantly patterned mosaic of detail, unexpected plot turns, suspenseful twists and revelations.",
    "For about two-thirds of the film, The Past’s release of information and emotion is almost perfect. Then, in the last third, it begins to feel contrived, as if Farhadi is trying to show a long chain of guilt, and to see how far it will unspool. The drawn-out revelations feel like overkill, though not enough to spoil what’s very good here.",
    "The Past is an understated study of two marriages in transition.",
    "Like the characters in this inter-connected world, you may feel the need to let go of The Past, only to realize, after the credits, the hold it still has on you.",
    "This is a tremendously well written piece of work, with impressively developed characters, with scene after scene that further enriches and deepens our comprehension of their actions, yet never judges any of them. It certainly helps that Farhadi gets quartet of excellent, pitch perfect performances.",
    "Farhadi navigates his complicated narrative thicket with an apparent ease that confirms yet again that he's an amazing talent, but here he isn't able to blend the brushstrokes as he has in prior films.",
    "These characters are so compelling that their stories are easy to get caught up in. As with \"A Separation,\" Farhadi's drama never strikes a resoundingly false note -- which is a precious thing in movies lately -- and as such is a film that promises moving rewards.",
    "It’s absorbing for a long while, at least half its two-hour running time — an evocatively photographed soap opera with actors who are impossibly gorgeous and yet human-looking — but it goes on and on, piling on twists, adding devices so clunky they’d have embarrassed most nineteenth-century problem-dramatists, refusing to jell despite the actors’ prodigious suffering.",
    "It’s intricate and often mature as drama, but it’s also meandering and at times heavy-handed, even melodramatic, and the tight control of time, place and action which made ‘A Separation’ so gripping is just not there."

As he so brilliantly showed in his last film (\"A Separation\"), director Asghar Farhadi has the ability to imbue even the most mundane moments with significance. As the conflicts develop, he elicits compelling performances from his entire cast (including the moving young Elyes Aguis). This is an intelligent writer/director: he lets the story unfold in small bits and never resorts to histrionics. There's no music or any other technique to manipulate the audience, just solid filmmaking and an absorbing drama. (In French with subtitles.)",

As the title indicates, \"The Past\" remains idle in a shared history with its characters who bear the weight of guilt and resentment that fuels this slow burn domestic drama. Ultimately, \"The Past\" explores the emotional damage that can incur when lines of communication inevitably break down.\r Marie (Bérénice Bejo) and Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa) are estranged spouses. Ahmad returns from Iran to France, where Marie lives, to finalize their divorce. When he arrives, he learns that Marie is living with Samir (Tahar Rahim), and Samir's young son, as well as with her own two children from a relationship previous to Ahmad. As Ahmad tries to make the best of his sometimes uncomfortable visit, he finds himself in the middle of several tumultuous situations. As the days pass, more about the lives of these people are revealed, and with considerable consequences.\r Farhadi's most complex and involving narrative to date provides a natural progression with no real plot twists while providing some unexpected turns. Teetering on the edge of contrived melodrama, the film builds towards a lackluster and formulaic finale that's nowhere nearly as compelling as Farhadi's uncanny ability to powerfully convey human insight and emotional turmoil. That being said, Farhardi's unsentimental and unforgiving approach ensures that this tale of domestic tension is in capable hands.",

The Past employs a similar setAnother powerful film by the director of A Separation, with this having less of the obvious dramatics of the former, but a similar exploration of moral uncertainty and, perhaps, the anguish of human experience. The Past employs a similar set of characters – modern Iranian woman, nice but slightly ineffectual husband, difficult teenage daughter, woman in a menial role who plays a catalytic role in the film. This time it was Paris, not Teheran, and Marie-Anne’s husband flies in from Iran to sign the divorce papers. To find his wife  ... you'll have to see the film! Anyway, lots of subtle twists & turns in the plot, and the agony of the children caught up in these adult dramas powerfully captured. And the film ends with you left wondering about what's happened, and what happens next. A great way to leave the cinema.",

We start with the relationship between a woman and her husband who returns to sign finalThis is one one the best movies I've ever seen.  Farhadi brilliantly takes us on a roller coaster ride through the relationships among the characters.  We start with the relationship between a woman and her husband who returns to sign final divorce papers.  He arrives at the airport and goes to baggage claim, but his suitcase has been lost.  She sees him and tries to get his attention but can't.  He finally sees her but there is a glass wall between them.  One expects that this relationship will be examined more in depth.  Instead, we careen to the mother-daughter relationship.  The mother hopes the husband can help with the daughter's worsening behaviors.  We then bounce to the mother-boyfriend relationship.  The mother and husband are going through the final divorce procedure and the boyfriend is calling.  He wants to know if he should accept the husband's damaged baggage which has been delivered to the house.  A critic described the plot as meandering.  I found it fascinating to go down the rabbit hole - but instead of straight down, we are redirected to tunnel after tunnel.  We end in a place impossible to predict.\rIn addition to the roller coaster ride through these relationships, we and the characters gradually learn their secrets and motives as both known and unknown to themselves.  We think we learn the truth, then it is violently ripped away.  We are largely left adrift and with ambiguity, yet the story is still satisfying because it feels real.  Being in the field of psychology, I was struck by the authenticity of the emotions, the misperceptions and the misplaced assumptions.  I believe this movie captures the complexity of relationships, motives and human truth better than any I've seen in recent memory.",

This past decisions is impact in our life and the others that we like them to much and Farhadi says \"Be careful of Bad effect\" maybe for this Marie never let to Ahmad to explain the reason for departure because She believe That decisions is the starting point for adventures that occurred four years later.Similarly, we can determine to the relationship between Marie and Samir or decision of Lucie or Naïma's decision and Or even the Céline's decision.",

What happens to the characters in the film is left up to you to decide but you really don't care and by the time you leave the auditorium you have forgotten the film. The film is set in a suburb of Paris but you would never know as it doesn't feature anything in France except most of the language is in French.\r The film is about relationships and there are many in this film starting with Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa) arriving from Iran, his homeland, where he had returned 4 years before not returning, leaving his wife Marie (Berenice Bejo) who has asked him to come back to sign the divorce papers. She has a new lover, Samir (Tahar Rahim) whom she is pregnant by and who has a wife in a coma in the hospital after attempting suicide. Marie has two children Lucie (Pauline Burlet) and Lea (Jeanne Jestin) from her first husband who now lives in Brussels with his wife while Samir has a son Fouad (Elyes Aguis) who has found a friend in Lucie. The two girls have come to see Ahmand as a father figure and it is Lucie, the ever sullen teenager, who points out to him and says, “Isn’t it obvious? The reason she is with Samir is because he looks like you!”\r Why does Marie insist that Ahmand stay with her and doesn’t book the hotel room he wanted? Why did Samir’s wife attempt suicide and will she come out of her coma? Samir owns a cleaners and has an illegal female worker Niama (Sabrina Ouazani) who was involved in a fight between his wife and a customer and the wife attempted the suicide in front of the worker. Marie has a sprained wrist which she blames the painting and refurbishing of her home and has nothing to do with the movie.\r The cast, in spite of being hindered by the director/writer, is more than adequate with Elyes Aguis as the young boy outstanding. Berenice Bejo who starred in  “The Artist” makes up for not talking in that film and is far from the happy dancing she played in that film. The men, Rahim and Mosaffa, are interesting to watch but, like all the characters in the film, neither their guilt, their relationships or why they do/did certain things are explained.\r “The Past” is too long by at least 20 minutes and though a movie doesn’t have to provide answers it asks too many unanswerable, unnecessary questions.",

It actually played more like a thriller than a small drama. The Past seems to be trying to replicate the formula, but for the most part it fails. In actuality it is a well acted but fairly ordinary film which only really comes alive in the last section when the true catalogue of events is finally revealed. Here the movie adopts 'A Separation's' bravura style and becomes more interesting. The shame is that by only half heartedly emulating the earlier film this one, by comparison, ends up being bland. Whereas 'A Separation' soared from beginning to end, The Past only flutters AT the end. Of the afore mentioned performances Tahar Rahim is the best as Berenice Bejo's boyfriend.",

I thought it would be another 'A Separation' which might deal about the usual domestic violence of belonging country. A story like this is very common to where I am from, so I was not tempted for it.

Like, I thought the role Samir is a pervert, but when story proceeded further everything looked different with changed atmosphere. That is because of the held back story in the initial portion.

When one after another begin to reveal, the development of characters widens so that made movie to have the power to entice the audience. For all this one man we must admire and it is none other than the writer and director, Asghar Farhadi. The actors as well posed a great performance to give a strong support to the director and his view.\r As, I think, this movie deserves much more praise and applaud from critic and audience than the director's previous flick. As you know I am a sentimental movie fan, so this movie acquired my complete attention and won my heart. The movie ended before resolving my doubts about the plot. Looks like it is understandable after seeing that particular end scene.

The film was a daunting, exhausting, and at-times experimental test on it’s audience thatIn 2011, I was introduced to Asghar Farhadi’s superb film A Separation and his unique “everything that can go wrong, will go wrong” storytelling style. The film was a daunting, exhausting, and at-times experimental test on it’s audience that pushed the boundaries of the degree to which people can watch the lives of others quickly spiral down and out of control, in a relatable everyday setting. With his newest film The Past, Farhadi sculpts a meticulous piece of cinema that reinvents the cliched English phrase, “the past comes back to haunt you”, and instead renegotiates it’s conventions to tell a story that shows how sometimes the past can instead come back to save you.\r The film, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2013 and played on the first night of screenings (although it was not the opening night film), was a big test to the skills and techniques of Farhadi’s uncompromising vision and narrative style. His Oscar winning film A Separation was regarded as one of the best films of that year, and in addition to winning the coveted Foreign Language Film top honour, Farhadi was also nominated for Best Original Screenplay, a feat that not many foreign language films reach, let alone their writer/director. Yet, Farhadi outdid himself once again with The Past; delivering a film that not only deepens the complexity of his characters and the moral dilemmas they face, but also pushes the conflicts of parents being accountable to their children, showing the selfishness of grown men and women and the daft choices they make, all in the name of love.\r To say that The Past is one of the most powerful, adult-driven dramatic narratives of the year, would be an understatement. Master auteur extraordinaire Farhadi delivers a film that tests the parameters of love, without ever giving us a clear-cut or wholly defined antagonist. His characters are people like you and me, dealing with life in the only ways we know how. Instead, the biggest villain in Farhadi’s film is life itself, with it’s unpredictable and sometimes diabolical sense of humour.\r This heavy-handed story of people caught in a twisted plot of love, adultery and confusion begins with Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa), a simple Iranian man who after four years of separation, travels to France to finalize his divorce with Marie (Bérénice Bejo). Marie has requested Ahmad’s return so that once their marriage is terminated, she will be able to marry Samir (Tahar Rahim), the owner of a laundromat and the new man in her life. Ahmad stays at Marie’s house along with her two daughters from a previous marriage, Lucie (Pauline Burlet) and Léa (Jeanne Jestin) as well as Samir’s son from his first wife, Fouad (Elyes Aguis), on the condition that while he is there, Samir stay somewhere else. Awkwardly forced to sleep in the same room as Samir’s son, Ahmad is able to make the best out of an uncomfortable situation, a trait we quickly learn defines Ahmad throughout the rest of the film. What develops then is a convoluted and highly delicate film with people who are just trying to make the best out of the situations they find themselves in.\r One of the beauties of a Farhadi film is its ability to show the true nature of people put in awkward and cynical situations. His men are furious, egotistical and macho in ways that allow other men to understand their own blow-ups and justify why their tempers flare. His women are strong and confident, using love as a muse to defy the limitations society has put on them. In action and in silence, his characters manoeuvre the unsteady terrain of life and the loud constraints of relationships. Throughout so many instances within the film, his characters find themselves lost for words and in a void that demands only silence. Yet within those subtle and incandescent moments of silence, the emotions of his characters are able to reach high decibels of intensity and range.\r One of the biggest differences between The Past and A Separation is Farhadi’s stunning ability to incorporate the perspectives and insights of the children involved in these complex relationships. Often times hysterical and warranting laughter, the film allows you time to step back and question the comedy in tragedy. At times, The Past plays out like a serious episode of Kids Say The Darnedest Things, through their perspectives, a perspective that oozes with innocence (as only a child has) is the very fabric that allows it’s audience to question the choices the characters make and the consequences they may have. The children in the film are deliberate aspirations of what the adults strive to be, even while they spew impulsive child-like behaviour that raises eyebrows constantly. Farhadi taps into this commonly misunderstood void of how the hasty actions of their parents affect the attitude and behaviour of their children, more often than not, resulting in unwanted character traits fueled by violence, anger and a desire to stand one’s ground.",

The film was a masterpiece of Asghar FarhadiCaught \"The past\" Asghar Farhadi's latest work last night in Isfahan\" Farhadi's hometown\" I gave ten star to the past like A separation but i confess that i like A separation more than this movie. The film was a masterpiece of Asghar Farhadi just like other film from this director. I hadn't been swept off my feet for a while, and The final sequence of the film had me amazing where name of Bérénice Bejo And Ali Mosaffa was appear in Céline and Samir hands masterfully. I will be shocked if this movie doesn't win an academy award and I hope heard the name Of Iran and Asghar Farhadi when the pocket will be open in this ceremony. This film start little late but when Ahmad and Lucie meet together for second time Farhadi enters first shock to the viewer. From this moments we can see specific signature of Farhadi's drama in this movie. Farhadi never talk about his movies explicitly but I guess purpose of The Past sending an alarm to the selfish man who's always run from his past or in other words its past decisions. This past decisions is impact in our life and the others that we like them to much and Farhadi says \"Be careful of Bad effect\" maybe for this Marie never let to Ahmad to explain the reason for departure because She believe That decisions is the starting point for adventures that occurred four years later.Similarly, we can determine to the relationship between Marie and Samir or decision of Lucie or Naïma's decision and Or even the Céline's decision.",

To my mind it is incredibly slow, predictable and takes itself almost laughably seriously. At half the length it might have had some dramatic tension, but only some. Constant small plot complications seem to be piled on top of one another to keep us going. Almost none of the chatacters are likable or even interesting. The exception is Ahmed, who has come back - almost inexplicably - to get his divorce. Apparently he was a bad boy 4 years ago, but now he's an angel. If he and Marie actually got it together again there might have been some point to the film. Without that particular plot complication, I'm left wondering 'Why?'",
