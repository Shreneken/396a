    "critic_reviews": [
        "Drunk on the visual majesty of Rome, just as Fellini once was, this is arthouse cinema at its most effortlessly entrancing, with life and art blending into one magnificent whole.",
        "If you know Federico Fellini's \"La Dolce Vita,\" you'll be unable to watch The Great Beauty without thinking about it. This gorgeous Italian movie, like its predecessor, balances pungent satire and a more melancholy mood in portraying the dissolute world of the upper crust in contemporary Rome.",
        "This 43-year-old filmmaker is a major talent. Though he may not be the second coming of Fellini, his films all have a funny, refreshingly complex perspective, and his latest work is a perfect example of why he is the next big Italian thing.",
        "A deliriously alive movie, The Great Beauty is the story of a man, a city, a country and a cinema, though not necessarily in that order.",
        "There's little sense in trying to resist the film's relentless boogie-woogie party vibe, its tumultuous visual banquet, its unpredictable sense of switchblade satire, its fools' parade of modern grotesques, or its river of startling melancholy, turning from a wary trickle to a flash flood by film's end. Sorrentino's vision is the size of Rome itself, and his confidence is dazzling.",
        "It\u2019s an exploration of all things surface, yes, but it has soul too.",
        "This movie looks and feels superb, it is pure couture cinema. But there is also a excess of richness and bombast and for all its sleekness I felt that the spark of emotion was being hidden, and there is a kind of frustration in the operatic sadness.",
        "A shimmering coup de cinema to make your heart burst, your mind swim and your soul roar.",
        "The pointlessness of Jep's journey is Sorrentino's point, richly made.",
        "Although Sorrentino\u2019s Fellini mash-up adds little of substance to what il maestro showed and said all those years ago, it\u2019s still a remarkable cinematic experience.",
        "The Great Beauty is a subtly daring cinematic high-wire act \u2014 an entire film built around one character\u2019s unrealized, unspecified yearning. And it might just be the most unforgettable film of the year.",
        "As its name promises, The Great Beauty is drop-dead gorgeous, a film that is luxuriously, seductively, stunningly cinematic. But more than intoxicating imagery is on director Paolo Sorrentino's mind, a lot more.",
        "The Great Beauty is an ironic and passionate near-masterwork, like a nine-course dessert that makes you entirely forget the meal.",
        "The ghost of Federico Fellini hovers wickedly over The Great Beauty, a fantastic journey around contemporary Rome and a riot of lush imagery juggling past and present, sacred and profane, gorgeous and grotesque.",
        "Sorrentino continues to tackle major topics using an extraordinary combination of broad brushstrokes and minute detail. Passion via the intellect has become his trademark, well suited to this dissection of empty diversions, indulged in by latter-day Neros fiddling while Rome burns.",
        "It's a beauty, all right. It's more a style show than a deep philosophical treatise, but with surfaces this sleek and faces this interesting, I'll take style over substance any day.",
        "An utterly ravishing portrait of listless luxuriance, a fantasy of decadent wealth and beauty.",
        "[Director Paolo Sorrentino] collects scenes of superficial extravagance and eccentricity, then finds the deeper yearnings they conceal.",
        "There\u2019s an exhilarating sadness to it all that amounts to cinematic poetry.",
        "Sorrentino\u2019s storytelling sometimes seems deliberately obscure, and his film can be as indulgent as the society it chronicles. But as this existential odyssey draws to a close, it sews itself up with the aplomb that only a confident, controlled filmmaker can marshal.",
        "It\u2019s a Fellini-esque carnival of humanity on display, a more debauched phantasmagoria reminiscent of \u201cLa Dolce Vita.\u201d But \u201cLa Dolce Vita\u201d created the paparazzi; The Great Beauty takes place in a world where the paparazzi have existed for decades.",
        "Sorrentino\u2019s dazzling tribute to Roman indulgence is a bittersweet, slightly surreal epic.",
        "If Marcello Mastroianni\u2019s character from \"La Dolce Vita\" hadn\u2019t stepped off the sweet-life treadmill, this is exactly who he would have become.",
        "Splashes of overstatement aside, the ambition intoxicates.",
        "Though Sorrentino\u2019s vision of moral chaos and disorder, spiritual and emotional emptiness at this moment in time is even darker than Fellini\u2019s...he describes it all in a pleasingly creative way that pulls audiences in through humor and excess.",
        "Even in its disassociation, The Great Beauty ingratiates itself as a witty and compelling companion \u2013 much like Jep Gambardella.",
        "Gambardella\u2019s world-weary look back at his sweet life, eclipsed by his turning sixty-five, is a dizzying fantasia of flash and filigree, and what it lacks in direct narrative is well patched-over with frenetic and emotion-rich sequences. This movie is a sight and sound workout.",
        "A lovely but rambling excursion through moneyed Rome, the film can\u2019t have remotely the same impact as its predecessor, but it does offer a cornucopia of dazzling images\u2014so many, frankly, that it becomes a bit exhausting, especially at nearly two and a half hours.",
        "La Grande Bellezza washes over you in series of scenes, visages, sensations and impressions, and although in this case it doesn't quite gel into a cohesive whole, it's nonetheless a journey worth taking; a travelogue through memory and dreams, in which life is greatest fiction we could ever create.",
        "Little beyond Servillo\u2019s presence gives the film any ballast, which is both asset and liability, freeing Sorrentino to pepper the screen with wild setpieces and fits of inspiration while encouraging a certain shapelessness.",
        "Paolo Sorrentino's film is really just a huge turn-on that has the bad manners to go sour, succumbing to its own self-delusions of moral/political grandeur.",
        "Sumptuous and self-indulgent, Sorrentino's latest is a Fellini-like feast for the eyes.",
        "The melancholy in this film is just as trumped up as the frenzy."

His day-to-day life is populated by serious and frivolous people doing frivolous and serious things, but in the pauses between their sometimes weird events, he's thinking deeply about the decisions of his life and what it all means. It helps that the lead actor has a face you can get lost in -- not handsome, but riveting. And visually overall, it's brilliantly inventive without being too \"arty.\" Have to say, for those who might be scared off by all the Fellini references: this is much more coherent than Fellini -- at least it was to me.",

Some scenes are surprisingly quiet and the visual imagery sort of speaks for itself, in a sense. I liked the classical style/operatic music played at times. It did seem to be a bit pretentious and I think it's fair to say that some of the script is a little...quirky, shall I say. I reckon its about identity, self-identity and the identity of the area its set in (Rome, Italy). There is a seediness to some of it. The main characters are mostly middle-aged to elderly men, Italian men and I certainly didn't feel much in the way of empathy towards them, given some of what's talked about. It's somewhat thoughtful and I suppose it is a bit atmospheric. There's an interesting scene featuring a young-ish child, a girl all but attacking a large white sheet with a variety of different coloured paint, as if defending herself against it. It is not the most...clear or accessible film as such, I think its fair to say but its certainly not without any interesting aspects. There is a certain poignancy in the 2nd half of the film too, certainly towards the end of the film, although i won't go into any details so as not to spoil it for others. Some scenes are quite darkly lit, adding to the sombre sense it has.Overall, its certainly not a bad film but its not an especially great one as such, certainly from the get go. Its ok, with some pretty good moments but its not one of the most memorable films I've seen overall. I wouldn't go out of my way to see it as such but if you enjoy films of this type then its probably worth catching if its on TV, that sort of thing, otherwise perhaps not. I liked the end credits for the background shown while their on screen. I hope this helps.",

He wrote one successful novel years ago and still spends his days moving in society's circles: dancing at wild parties, having useless conversations, viewing performance art and questioning it all. If you're familiar with Fellini you'll see his touches all over: sumptuous images of Roman life and locations, freaky characters and incongruous imagery all combined in glimpses, not in linear narrative. On the other hand, the film is missing the master's magic. If you're into art films, this might appeal. I found it beautiful to behold, but oh so tedious, labored and indulgent.

He begins to meditate on the existential meaning of his life, through his eyes, we are invited to probe the unseen vista of the middle-class\u2019 decadence in the urban Roman society, it is a ritual, sentimental prose, plus an ode to the foregone glory.\r As a man with certain social status, Jep descends into nostalgic about the past, especially when he learns the death of his first lover, he recollects his memory of her, and meets a middle-aged stripper Ramona (Ferilli), who is an unwonted idealist with an enigmatic secret (not her intimacy with Botox obviously). They form a platonic relationship, romanticizes the ideal of love instead of making love. There are other facet of Jep\u2019s life which concerns his friends, his pygmy boss Dadina (Vignola), an affluent widow Viola (Villoresi) with her radical son Andrea (Marinelli), the condescending Stefania (Ranzi), the lascivious Lello Cava (Buccirosso) with his wife Trumeau (Forte) and Romano (Verdone), an ill-fated writer. They all have their episodic presence in Jep\u2019s life, their stories are more or less expanded but never elaborated.\r The portmanteau structure meanders over 2 hours, like a night cruise, sometimes we admire, sometimes we laugh, sometimes we indulge, not that the narrative matters, as if Sorrentino has a non-stop palliative generator to peddle viewers its pills to be enchanted with petrifying exquisiteness (from the body-swirling parties, then a giraffe disappears in a jiffy to the magical flamingos summoned by the wizened Saint), idiosyncratic modern art (Talia Concept, a kid\u2019s performance art and Ron Sweet\u2019s self-portrait exhibition, or maybe the Botox clinic, looks like a wacky play), and not to mention the groovy shindigs, all arrayed in painterly compositions, but Jep is not among all of this, he is an onlooker, a parvenu with patronizing stance to reflect the recognition we are hankering for, sophisticated, superior yet still hasn\u2019t found what he is looking for. Servillo (only 55 but always passes for older men) exemplifies the role without detectable effort, his creased physiognomy is telling enough to indicate what\u2019s in his vulpine mind.\r It is easy to find allusions to the vintage national auteurs like Fellini, Visconti with Sorrentino\u2019s darkly flamboyant touch, but the film seems to no more a panegyric to the ancient capital than a contemplative eulogy which fixates on the internal struggle of aging, not only our lives are ephemeral, so is the aggregate city itself, and this is what beckons the core of the Academy voters, I can safely put my ante on a BEST FOREIGN PICTURE win in the upcoming Oscar ceremony, a majestic 15-year comeback to the kudos after LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL (1998, 8/10).",

This time he chose to portray again an another old man who used to be a novelist. The story commences on his 65th birthday party. With an awesome music and dance at the beginning, it kicks starts to tell the protagonist's rest of the story.\r Jep is a novelist who gave up writings a long ago. On his 65th birthday, he decides to enjoy the rest of his last stage of the life. Roaming around the city of ruined Rome, he discovers similar to his earlier phase of life in people who encounters on the streets. Especially the first girl he admired the most when he was in the 20s. The screen shares between past and present in the presentation. Like a man's in search of a great beauty at the age of dusk.\r An 2014 OSCAR submission from Italy and nominated for short list as well. Will this justify to be nominated? Well, I think yes. Some of the scenes are not quite relevant to the story, just like dragging in from out of the topic. At a time it was artistic and eye catching. Throughout, the music is what well backed the irrelevant material story. Especially the opening and funeral ones were incredible.\r Many scenes had not explained its purpose. Sometime you make scratch your head about not getting the meaning. One of those was the conference of world spiritual leaders takes place. Exactly, it is not about what it's trying to tell us, but the capacity for understanding on stuffs will be tested. This movie can't be enjoyed by everyone, but certain people will find hidden gem and messages or an art form of it in its depth.\r I earlier mentioned it is a irrelevant story, it might be a little harsh to say that because protagonist in the movie itself confused about his remaining life. So he begins to see in people his life reflection and sometime he won't understand others character behaviour. On many occasions he asks them about it, but the answers won't convince him till he himself witness the truth. We had seen in other movies where the protagonist goes to India for self discovery, and that is what here this man does in own city.",

The beauty of art is very rarely understood unanimously or collectively, instead it becomes an expression of human beings that flourishes through argument, rebuttals and questions. Fortunately, the same can be said with the film in review. One of the many beauties of The Great Beauty remains to be it\u2019s amazing ability to allow the perceptions of many to decide the beauty and horror that is contained in it\u2019s small, avant-garde shell.\r More often than not, the film is a collection of images, situations and nuances where it\u2019s meaning is just as dumbfounding or interpretative as any abstract portrait or painting. From scenes involving a magician disappearing a giraffe where the payoff is never explained, an opera choir singing whilst an Asian tourist falls face-first, dead, or the image of a capsized boat in the water off the coast of Rome, there are more than just a few instances where the film itself is a colourful and fantastical ode to the late great Federico Fellini. Rather than just being a Fellini wannabe film, writer/director Paolo Sorrentino gives us a glimpse into the many questionable lifestyle formulas within the epicentre of Italy\u2019s posh social elites, the city of Rome.\r The film is driven by way of high-class professional socialite Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo), a rousing misogynist, or what he prefers to be called, a misanthrope, whose life since the age of twenty-six has surrounded the snobby upper-class Italian elite and their artistic appetites. Jep is a writer who is still riding the waves of success from his first and only book, L\u2019Apparato Umano (The Human Apparatus), and whose presence is still heavily felt in Rome. Like so many great writers, Jep is completely aware of his potential to impact the lives of others, yet rather than embrace his talent, he prefers to use his status as a dignified God-like scribe for the sake of\u2026nothing really. As he struts his fine-tailored suit throughout the underbelly of Rome\u2019s busy nightlife and sleeps while Rome\u2019s financially struggling lower and middle class work, Jep enjoy his life drinking, smoking, sleeping, eating, socializing, and complaining about the trivial matters that plague the Italian upper-class. As Jep narrates, \u201cIt\u2019s all settled beneath the chitter chatter and the noise, silence and sentiment, emotion and fear. The haggard, inconstant flashes of beauty. And then the wretched squalor and miserable humanity. All buried under the cover of the embarrassment of being in the world\u201d. Exactly.\r Contrary to it\u2019s marketing and promotional material, the film itself is beautifully shot, but far from following any sort of linear storyline. Jumping in and out of flash-backs of Jep\u2019s youth, the film is a vessel to understanding Italy\u2019s obsession with keepin up appearances, and actually has less to do with Jep\u2019s life as a whole. The film is loaded with scenes involving examples of ridiculous high art practices; from wall-slamming nude women, knife-throwing gypsy men, and volatile little girls throwing paint cans onto a blank canvas. The Great Beauty is a film whose commentary on the ridiculousness of Rome\u2019s posh few are questioned and palpable, not because of it\u2019s unbelievability, but more-so for it\u2019s deep-rootedness in truth and reality. I have personally never been to Rome, or Italy for that matter, but much like the film itself, Sorrentino allows audience members to envision Rome in the same way he uses it; as a portable backdrop for the countless fashion photo shoots, bizarre street art performers and a stage for the operatic.\r Aside from the people, there is a richness underneath The Great Beauty, which is its commentary on beauty itself. Dabbing into the world of plastic surgery, clubbing, and high-art, Sorrentino\u2019s lens is a tell-all opening to the very haggard and inconstant flashes of beauty that become borderline repulsive and monstrous. Eventually, everyone surrounding Jep becomes more and more inhuman and almost caricature like, far from Jep\u2019s initial desires. It is not until one of Jep\u2019s previous lovers dies where Jep is, pulled back into the world where everyone, including himself, is in search for the great beauty of life.\r Although it\u2019s title may be The Great Beauty, the film itself becomes a de-glamourization and far-fetched reality of the abusive and overindulgent spectacle of a frivolous and uncaring class of socialites. The Great Beauty is undoubtedly an intricate and wholly cinematic apparatus, but, as Jep says, it is also just a film that highlights Italy\u2019s \u201cblah, blah, blah\u2026\u201d in high manner and fashion.",

Yet the decadence of the 60's elite was far more elegant, in a way, than our own age's, and this is shown throughout through an old man with radically cynical thoughts who's forcing himself to appear, to be in the spotlight.

And this film has all things Italian: style, of course, but more than that it's the attitude that no matter how they look, they're confident in themselves.  There were lots of ironic moments in the film as well:  almost as if it were the Italians mocking themselves.  Film centers around a main character, and Toni Sevillo is perfect.  His character is memorable:  he stands out like a character in a great novel.  All the other actors, almost stock characters are perfect too.  The film's got some ideas too:  ideas about art, and life, and transcendence, but somehow one doesn't pay much attention to these too, given all this beauty.",

This is not for people that have seen The Expendables on purpose. It\u2019s art, and while the characters are often pretentious it is not so itself. It touches upon everything by being true in everything it touches. There is poise, and brilliance, and perfection in the performances, the script, the direction, and the exquisite cinematography. The only complaint I can possibly think of is that it has the ambiance of that old world sexism in it, the kind that is unintentional but also unapologetic. There\u2019s nothing overt, but the protagonist Jep smacks of those older white male intellectuals that get to go around feeling like they get something that no one else can. He is not that, because no one in the film feels like a trope, but throughout young women appear as poseurs disproportionately to their male counterparts. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true of Italy, but where everything else in the film feels like it resonates on a universal level, this feels temporal, and it drags the achievement down a little from where it might have otherwise been.",
