  "critic_reviews": [
    "While screenwriter Tom Stoppard supplies a literate script, it’s Spielberg’s peerless command of film technique that drives the film, with the director crafting a number of sequences that function as impressive examples of pure visual storytelling.",
    "As Jim, Bale delivers a stunning performance; he appears in virtually every frame and truly seems to grow over the course of the film from a coddled rich child to a calculating, almost feral creature who will ally himself with whoever wields the most power in a given situation.",
    "Spielberg's technical ability is very clear, with much to appreciate on close examination.",
    "A visual splendor, a heroic adventurousness and an immense scope that make it unforgettable.",
    "Spielberg has energized each frame with allusive legerdemain and an intelligent density of images and emotions.",
    "Empire of the Sun remains a solidly engaging story of heroism in the face of adversity, as filtered through the eyes of a boy obsessed with planes and flight.",
    "It is up to young English thesp Bale to engage the viewer's interest, which he does superbly.",
    "Empire of the Sun adds up to a promising idea, a carefully observed production and some interesting performances.",
    "Though Empire of the Sun is a profoundly perplexing, frustrating object, there are things in it to marvel at and enjoy.",
    "The pseudomystical vagueness that seems to be Spielberg's stock-in-trade stifles most of the particularity of the source.",
    "The film is sober, serious-minded and paced like a funeral march.",
    "For all its good intentions, for the thrillingly staged moments in the film's first quarter-for all the sweeping movement of thousands of people streaming through the streets of Shanghai-and for all its not-inconsiderable craft, the film's grave problem is a lack of central heating: We don't have a single character to warm up to.",
    "Behind the trademark fancy package is a troubling sensibility, too. Spielberg seems unable to come to terms with anything real."

With a fantastic performance from a young Christian Bale, the film also sports phenomenal cinematography and strong writing that really make for a solid film. That said, the film is held back from being truly great by a few things. As the film is told from Bale's perspective and he is a child, obviously things can become unclear. In terms of a film, this can be a bit annoying as you feel as though you never really receive the film picture or scope of the proceedings. Additionally, the film can be quite slow. I have no problem with slow films, but there were a few times of this 150 minute runtime that the film did drag. This happens enough to hamper the film a bit. Fortunately though, Empire of the Sun is lovingly crafted and a thoroughly well made war film. Even if it does slack at times, it still more than accomplishes its goal and is a really moving look at WWII and is particularly compassionate towards the Japanese, which is a nice touch.",

Ballard to the big-screen, with then up-and-comer Christian Bale doing the heavy lifting as the young protagonist who loses track of his family and subsequently succumbs to the harsh realities of human hardship. And, to be absolutely sure, Christian Bale commits to the role entirely, offering up an incredible performance for anyone, let alone that of someone at such a young age at the time. In fact, all of the acting is up to snuff. Where this movie falters, I find, is actually in that of one of its primary intentions. Part of the movie's aim is to really drive home the desperation and exhaustion on the part of the film's main character. In relating the devastation and pain at hand -- especially towards the end of the film -- the movie does this a bit too well, in my opinion, ultimately allowing things to dip in terms of entertainment value. Granted, this isn't necessarily a movie that's supposed to entertain you, but my engagement suffered nonetheless.",

Spielberg est sans conteste ce que le cinéma américain fait quasiment de pire et est au 7ème art ce que le MacDo est à la bonne bouffe : son « Empire du soleil » est un gros big mac qui vient de se suicider en sautant de la table, sur lequel on se fait une joie et un devoir de marcher dessus.

To drive an entire more than two hours of a film with a kid on the lead role to speak of a tale that is bizarrely horrendous and gloomy to be palpable. But then this is Spielberg's strongest genre, and the reason why his take on war over the year has created such a jarring effect on the viewers is to his gore yet clean vision. There is undoubtedly inedible sequences as the concept suggests and demands, but his little tactics through which he scales the depth of the water, is to be admired in here.Barring no restraints on taking the storyline to various places and wider ranges, the consistency is kept alive through familiar faces that shows up every now and then like surfing through different channels. Spielberg's world is not dependent of any medium, as the war should be, and through physical sequences with using less words as possible, he demands attention of the viewers on a much larger scale. Bale, upfront in the field, marching without any flags or troops, is a committed floating bubble that narrates this resistance fluently.Among all the harrowing images shown, one of the worst ought to be Bale's innocence being ripped off in the field to almost nothing. And it's that journey of nothing to existence, if not meaningful, that arcs up a magnificent moon on the screen; a pure brilliance. But all the good bits aside, there are times where the film sinks too much into the semantics of it to brew the bittersweet essence of the tale. Nevertheless, Spielberg's second World War triumph claimed Empire Of The Sun has a white bright light that Bale sees it and so do we.",
