  "critic_reviews": [
    "Elliptical, full of subtle inner rhymes...and profoundly moving, this is the most tightly crafted Kubrick film since \"Dr. Strangelove,\" as well as the most horrific; the first section alone accomplishes most of what \"The Shining\" failed to do.",
    "Kubrick's harrowing, beautiful and characteristically eccentric new film about Vietnam, is going to puzzle, anger and (I hope) fascinate audiences as much as any film he has made to date... A film of immense and very rare imagination.",
    "May be the best war movie ever made...Different is Kubrick's artistry and control, and his almost perverse, but philosophically progressive, refusal to impart to chaos a coherent narrative contour.",
    "The most eloquent and exacting vision of the war to date... Inspired with technique rather than overblown with it, Kubrick, the filmmaker's filmmaker, lays one on you.",
    "An intense, schematic, superbly made Vietnam War drama.",
    "We've seen it all before, most recently in \"Gardens of Stone,\" most romantically in \"An Officer and a Gentleman,\" but never more elegantly than here as Kubrick sustains the athletic ballet of obstacle courses and white-glove inspections for a breathtaking 40 minutes.",
    "A perversely fascinating movie--one that answers no questions, offers no hope and has little meaning. In a way this is perfect for what the film has to say about war, but you find yourself numbed and apathetic as the film progresses.",
    "The footage on the Paris Island obstacle course is powerful. But Full Metal Jacket is uncertain where to go, and the movie's climax, which Kubrick obviously intends to be a mighty moral revelation, seems phoned in from earlier war pictures.",
    "While far too much of the film is staged discussion and smug political jousting, there is savage and lethal black irony."

He kept calling them degrading names such as sluts, pussies et. al. But then as the movie progresses on, I was drawn to Private Pyle, who had an obvious bad case of A.D.D. Initially, I was quite irritated of him with his clumsiness and slow pick up abilities to their unforgiving trainor. Due to Pyle's excess weight which obviously made him unable to keep up with the harsh physical rigors of training, he was kept from eating sweets and the teacher found out how Pyle caped a doughnut. He was made to eat it infront of his classmates while they were punished for him. Everytime he f...ed up, it was his classmates who paid for it. He was beaten with bricks [Ed: Soap, actually] while he was prevented from making a sound by his co-trainees when they got fed up of him. The only one who used to bear with him by necessity, Private Joker, didn't do anything about it. After it, Pyle cried like a child bullied in a kindergarden yard. And it was my first time to really sympathize with a character, I bawled like a baby too. I was just so moved how nobody stood up for him. It's been two days since I've watched FMJ, but the face of Pyle keeps haunting me. The cinematography of the film and the plot when they got to 'Nam sucks big time, but kudos to Kubrick for tugging my cynical heart. It's kinda new for me to be troubled by a film character, and for that, good job Kubrick.",

And definitely, if it was a successful movie, it would be the best war movie in the history of cinema. But the film does not match the logic of Kubrick's filmmaking and the director's subconscious. The logic of Kubrick's filmmaking is not that, for example, The camera is in favor of the soldier at the beginning of the film, or that it condemns such militarism. This type of narration is definitely simplistic. Maybe my idea also agrees with the director's point of view, but because it is not completely realistic in the movie , The movie is unsuccessful. However, it is a great movie, but it is not the greatest war movie in the history of cinema like \"paths of Glory\".",

You can definitely tell that it's a Kubrick movie. It has all of his signature style, such as his use of the wide angle lens and backwards moving cameras.  But this movie can't escape its second half.  Its second half feels empty and lifeless.  It also doesn't help that it ends on an anti climactic note.  It starts out feeling like it's going to be something epic, but ends being contrived, and forgettable, and therefore Kubrick's vision loses most of its power.",

I am with those who thinks the first half is better than the second, but that is not to say the second half isn't good, it is more than good, but the first half really was outstanding.

They (Congress is included in \"they.\") want us to start all over again in both the player and disc. It's really unfair. The picture is much better, but, using FMJ as an example, I've bought it in VHS, then DVD, then again in 5.1 SS DVD, and would buy it again in letterboxed format, but switching to a new DVD format is asking too much. Apparently, we're missing a good bit in this modified version of the film. I've emailed WB's site, pleading for a widescreen release in the present DVD format and maybe they would if enough people showed an interest. This excellent, very intelligent and challenging film deserves release in its proper format without having to buy a $1,000.00 DVD player. Among comtemporary filmmakers, Kubrick was without peers and I would rank him above Welles, though I'm sure this comment will cause many film buffs to go ape.",

A friend of mine Stanley Kubrick's daunting two-part monolith also communicates on a gut level, yet it is the most deceptively simple work he has ever made--and even more resistant to easy interpretation than his 2001: A Space Odyssey. A friend of mine who was a Marine sergeant in the Tet offensive assures me that so many details are botched that the film is worthless as history; insofar as coscreenwriter Michael Herr has recently pointed out that Kubrick set out to make a certain kind of war film before he settled on either Vietnam or Gustav Hasford's novel The Short-Timers, I see no reason to doubt this testimony. But conventional realism seems so far from Kubrick's purposes that I can't dismiss the film for these infidelities either. I'm more inclined to ponder lead actor Matthew Modine's provocative suggestion that Kubrick's relationship to other commercial directors is analogous to the position of the early Cubists. Combining this sense of poetic abstraction with a subject as \"hot\" as Vietnam (or colonialism in general) is a risky and daring move, but I can't side with those who fault Kubrick for \"coldness\" simply because they can't anticipate or see through him (as they can with a genuine iceberg like Brian De Palma). It's been at least a quarter of a century since I've seen Kubrick's awkward first feature Fear and Desire (1953)--long since suppressed by Kubrick himself--but it is that touching and compassionate amateur film about young men at war, set in no particular place or time, that Full Metal Jacket evoked for me, refined, perfected, and chiseled to such a fine point that it fully expresses what the earlier film only implied. The vision may be hard as nails, but it is one without villains or other easy bromides.",

Though, this one is certainly brutal in many different ways as it did a great job developing its characters. Many war films go for action rather than character development, but here, we got a bit of both and really became connected to the soldiers. This connection made the events here all the more tragic and hard to watch. The acting here is great, especially from R. Lee Ermey, who really steals the show. Stanley Kubrick's direction is fabolous as expected as well. The first half here is also far superior to the second half, in large part thanks to Ermey, but really, all of the events in the first half are much better presented than the second half, which at times, can be a little odd in the way things occur. But, the second half is still quite good, even if a little bit of a drop off from the perfect first half. Overall, Full Metal Jacket is a very good film that presents the trauma faced by soldiers in war very well and while no war film is completely unique, this one takes familiar elements and improves upon them.",

Whereas the first stage explained how young men lost their humanity and succumbed to brutality, their struggle in Hue was a bit of an irony as they, in spite of superior equipment and manpower, managed to take down just one little 12-year-old-like Vietnamese female sniper only after suffering three fatal casualties. I consider this film an epic anti-war classic revealing the truth about the U.S Army behind the glamour of the fame as world's strongest combat force",

The movie follows the journey of a marine nicknamed Private Joker through Vietnam, starting in boot camp and eventually ending up in the war.The first half of the film is set in boot camp and is amazing, one of the reasons for that being the drill instructor. Apparently, the actor who portrayed him used to do drill instructing himself so he was just left to say what he wanted to say as he knews what one would say in a real situation. This adds a sense of realism to it and that is one of the main things I like about this film- it feels very realistic and feels like you're experiencing war with them. Private Pyle was very well portrayed and his journey through boot camp is very engaging and goes places you probably wouldn't expect at times. Matthew Modine was also good as Joker, with his charisma, courageousness and relatability as a character.The grittiness of war is displayed really well, in particular in the boot camp. You see that the marines don't get to have their say and are treated like animals. Private Pyle's character shows perfectly how all of this can affect someone.The second half of the film is Joker when he is actually in the war. The quality does definitely drop here and I thought the pacing was a little off at times and it also got quite dull sometimes but it was still entertaining and the final act was very gripping and I really enjoyed it; it was constantly tense and if you watch it you'll probably see what I mean.Upon first viewing, I was quite confused as to all of the events in the second half linked together and how they were relevant to the first half but now that I've gone back over the story I understand it now and I appreciate it more now.As I stated earlier, I love how the film feels very realistic and the reason it feels like this is for the great characters I believe. Also mentioned earlier, it makes you feel like you're experiencing these events with them.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. The first half was absolutely amazing and while the quality did drop in the second half, it was still enjoyable with a great final act and the performances for the drill instructor and Private Pyle are great. Joker is also a good main character to root for.8.2/10",

Matthew Modine at the centre of it pulls it off swiftly and smoothly but is overpowered by a stunning performance by Vincent D'Onofrio despite of just being a supportive character. Full Metal Jacket resonates too much with The Clockwork Orange as it raises similar questions, offers enough doubts and thrills which becomes redundant at a certain point and as always lacks better editing.",

The first half, which focuses on boot camp training, is by far the best. It has the finest performances, cinematography, and pacing in the entire movie. The second half is still really good, but it suffers from unsympathetic main characters and a sometimes unfocused story.

But 2 brilliant standalone halves form a coherent and captivating whole. The drill sergeant is one of the best casting decisions in movie history (and a very interesting backstory at that). His lines are delivered rapidly & immaculately by the actor, who wasn't even an actor before this movie, and leaves us with no doubt about the violence as sexual release ethos which drives so much of what drowns us in this world. Matthew Modine in the main role also a perfect casting choice, who makes the \"duality of man\" sarcasm credible, a difficult feat. Absent a few short sequences, you don't feel the same awe of the photography as is normally the case with Kubrick, but he did make war (and training for war) feel incredibly personal. The chaos we normally see in war movies adds to \"realism\", but reduces our hold on the characters' POV. Here, Kubrick wisely downsizes the number of soldiers visible in each sequence, which helps us feel the pulsating fear of impending (and needless) death.",
