  "critic_reviews": [
    "RoboCop looks more than ever like Verhoevenâ€™s masterpiece, a classic of 80s Hollywood and apart from everything else a brilliant commentary on the city of Detroit; hi-tech RoboCop is a harbinger of the decline of the automotive industry and the ruin-porn wasteland to come.",
    "Robocop is as tightly worked as a film can be, not a moment or line wasted.",
    "A first-rate production full of nonstop action and inventive special effects but what truly makes Robocop spellbinding is a superior script.",
    "It was this love of mayhem combined with a biting comic attack on neo-fascist corporatism - most notably seen in the TV ads for products like the apocalyptic board game Nuke 'Em - which helped raise Robocop above the common sci-fi herd.",
    "With its droll underpinnings, Robocop does for cyborgs and Detroit what \"Blade Runner\" did for androids and L.A.",
    "Robocop is one weird and entertaining hybrid of camp and sci-fi shoot-'em-up.",
    "Robocop is a thriller with a difference.",
    "Paul Verhoeven, a Dutch director (\"Soldier of Orange\"), doesn't let the furiously futuristic plot get in the way of the flaming explosions, shattering glass and hurtling bodies.",
    "Great effects and a nasty undercurrent drive this vehicle.",
    "The action is skillfully directed by Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven, and there are many bursts of razor-sharp social satire. But the story amounts to a celebration of brute force in a crudely etched law-and-order context.",
    "There's a brooding, agonized quality to the violence that almost seems subversive, as if Verhoeven were both appalled and fascinated by his complicity in the toxic action rot."

The urban decay predicted in this film actually occurred: to this day the Detroit bankruptcy is the largest municipal bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, and this film was spot on.

Very over-the-top as well, with surreal gory scenes, some that are really disturbing at times. Not for the faint of heart. Solid performances, surprising dramatic heft, though I wished the writers could have digged into the family relationship with the main character more. The hero's partner should have also been more of a focus, in my opinion. The villain's plans were simple, yet their attitude and personality were enjoyable and reasonable. The score is great and memorable, also.

When I first heard about RoboCop I actually thought about the videogame before the film. That intrigued me because I see it's made in the 80's. Until The Terminator have hit most fans claiming it to be one of the best film ever made, Paul Verhoeven making his film look iconic and brutal. Some of the violence are over-the-top and bloody! Most of the time when it gets bloody, it gets bloody and gets it really quick! Like the scene where Alex Murphy gets shot many times by Clarence Boddicker and his gang, it is gory! Now Alex Murphy is put to the hospital but he's dead and was resurrected and being created as RoboCop by Bob Morton. The creation of RoboCop infuriated Dick Jones. The ED-209 is made by stop-motion animation. The way you look at it, it looks exactly something you seen before in the older films. I enjoyed the shootouts from the film like in the drug factory where they sell cocaine and puts Boddicker to jail for charge of being a cop killer. The film is absolutely underrated it's possibly be one of Paul Verhoeven's best work, no matter what! It has memorable one-liners that everybody will say over and over again and it will phenomenon the fans who are a huge fan of the Terminator films.",

An astute criticism of American culture and also a fantastic shoot em up late 80's action flick, Robocop features solid acting, solid special effects, and a killer plot coupled with great direction and writing. A fun and entertaining film, Robocop works on both a pure entertainment level and the satirical level, similar to Verhoeven's later work on Starship Troopers. In Robocop, Verhoeven uses its relatively straight forward plot as a tool to critique American culture, namely when it comes to violence, television, the military, capitalism, and the very infrastructure of our society. In addition, I also really thought Verhoeven was ahead of his time in his portrayal of women here, as they are shown as being largely on the same playing field as men and if you did not know better, you would have no idea what gender they are. Somehow, this film was criticized for being sexist, but I have no idea how. As I watched, I was struck by how well done the women in the film were, but I guess maybe I am the one who is wrong. Who knows. Anyways, Robocop is a very well made action film by Paul Verhoeven that is both entertaining and thought provoking.",

But unfortunately this movie was done in the 1980's which means you're stuck with cheesy, over-the-top acting, mediocre effects (though I'm sure they were at least decent when the film was made), and the same piss poor directing that plagued so many films in the era. I think there's a lot of potential to the story and the human element and internal conflict of the RoboCop/Murphy character but the film largely skims right past most of that focusing more on needless side clips of a setting that was never established or non-critical villains. I'm interested to see the reboot version and hoping they go the direction so many other films in this generation of action movies have gone... dark, realistic, and gritty. If you gave this concept to Christopher Nolan, you'd have an amazing movie. Hopefully the reboot can be everything the original was not. Now it sounds like I'm being really hard on the movie and yet I gave it a 7/10 so what gives? Well, it was still a good movie, even with all the minor negatives, because the story has so much potential and even with the poor execution it manages to pull you in.",

The movie takes place in the near-future Detroit where there is a dystopia and the city is on the brink of societal and financial collapse.

Corrupt rich executives at the company end up creating Robocop after a good cop, Alex Murphy, is almost killed by Detroit gangsters. Following the introduction of Robocop there are some amusing scenes showcasing Robocop apprehending bizarre crimes. From there, the rest of the movie gets a little sentimental about the humanity of Robocop and how he still has some memory of his family. The movie is also a satire of corrupt crony capitalism and corporatism controlling the police force. The film is very effective in what it is trying to convey and still holds up as a classic.",

'Robocop' is one of these old movies that doesn't seem to have aged. The main reason is maybe that it still feels current. Special effects are not that bad, maybe just the design is old-fashioned. Plot, although with hindsight is predictable, is well brought and the whole movie in general has a very good pace. The fake advertising and television news are funny as hell and do contibute to the atmosphere of the movie. It has the ability to make us laugh, fear and be disgusted in alternately. Only the (no spoil) seems to be rushed and happens too fast. An interesting questionning of our humanity and our daily societies.",
