  "critic_reviews": [
    "Though not as visually impressive as comparable Terry Gilliam fare such as Jabberwocky, the verbal wit is fast and abundant (abetted with cameos by Billy Crystal, Peter Cook and Mel Smith), and you'd better believe the midnight movie crowd will remember almost all of it.",
    "An effective comedy, an interesting bedtime tale, and one of the greatest date rentals of all time.",
    "As a good fairy tale should, The Princess Bride teaches but never preaches. It's a lively, fun-loving, but nevertheless epic look at the nature of true love.",
    "It is filled with good-hearted fun, with performances by actors who seem to be smacking their lips and by a certain true innocence that survives all of Reiner's satire.",
    "A percolating comedy. The laughs may not tear your belly up, but they're constant and they dovetail with the story.",
    "Not even the crude ethnic humor--Billy Crystal's Mel Brooks-ish Miracle Max--pricks the dream bubble, and the spirited cast has a field day.",
    "A hilarious mixture of Errol Flynn swashbuckler and Monty Python send-up...When it comes to pleasing both kids and adults, you can't do much better.",
    "Reiner's penchant for hip little riffs -- Billy Crystal as a yiddish wizard, etc. -- dilutes primal power in favor of genial fun.",
    "Reiner abandons his previous movie's sense of farce and satire for much broader and more innocuous comedy.",
    "Rob Reiner's not up to it: when the movie is meant to be romantic, the tone is frequently mushy and sexless, and when it's meant to be anachronistic and satiric, it's vaudeville-vulgar.",
    "It also doesn't help that Cary Elwes and Robin Wright as the loving couple are nearly comatose and inspire little passion from each other, or the audience."

Wallace Shawn as Vizzini is \"inconceivably\" funny.  His mental duel with The Dread Pirate Roberts is classic.  Mandy Patikin and his quest for the Man with the Six Fingers blends in throughout;  his duel with Westley is one of the best sword fights I have seen in movie history.  Then there are the quick cameos of Billy Crystal and Carol Kane as the Miracle Man and his wife - another great scene.  Intermixing all of this is that the story is really being \"read\" by Peter Falk to his sick grandson, played by Fred Savage right before he started his Wonder Years period.",

Unfortunately I felt pretty disappointed by it; given the hype, I was surprised by how weak it was in several key areas. The fantasy setting lacks a feeling of substance, and is just generally nondescript. This is not helped by the visual execution; the sets, visual effects and cinematography are bland and amateurish. The story itself is very by the numbers, and lacks momentum and emotional resonance. There's a framing device with a grandfather reading the story to his son, and while it was one of the better executed aspects of the film, I couldn't really see what it added. The characters are also generally rather clichéd -- the villains especially, and also the romantic duo, who lack any spark. Most of the acting is also uninspired or poor, the main exceptions being the main hero, who is played with an eccentric unflappability, and a vengeful swordsman, who has a sort of portentous magnetism. The interplay between these two near the start of the film was a high point, with good choreography and memorable dialogue. There are a good number of similarly memorable and witty lines throughout the film. This is the film's saving grace, and the main reason that I'm not giving it a bad score. But equally, that one aspect on its own can't make up for the film's many deficits. In conclusion, I can see how the film's quotability could make it entertaining for repeat viewings of a devoted fanbase, and how the cheesiness and clichés could be endearing. But personally I found that the cheesiness felt more like poor workmanship, and the clichés weren't self-aware or entertaining, but the result of blandness.",

Funny, adventurous, and romantic, there are not many demographics that are missed here. Incredibly well-written and quite well-directed by Rob Reiner. The film's pacing is quite assured and could be well-advised to cool off a bit, especially in the beginning, but it is never truly a glaring problem. Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant, and especially Billy Crystal are all great and turn in hilariously over-the-top performances. The sequence with Crystal stands out as the best in the film due to its comedic elements. On that note, the film is not quite as funny as I anticipated, but is very, very funny all the same. It expertly blends this comedy with a captivating adventure tale and a very touching and well-crafted romance fitting for its fairy tale approach.

The movie, like the book is a classical story of true love, overcoming all the odds to find happiness, and it alsoThe Princess Bride was originally a book written by William Goldman in 1973 and he turned it into a screenplay 10 years later. The movie, like the book is a classical story of true love, overcoming all the odds to find happiness, and it also happens to be one of the rare cases where the movie is as good as the book.\r One of the things that makes this movie so great is the unique way that the story is told. All too often when a book is created into a movie it is just a retelling of the book without its own twist on the story or way to make it more than a retelling, and more often than not if a movie adds its own twist it completely ruins the story. The Princess Bride is an exception to that rule, the whole premise for the movie is a sick young boy, played by Fred Savage, and his grandfather, played by Peter Falk, gives him The Princess Bride for a present and starts to read it to him. This inventive way to tell the story allowed the writers to go from scenes from the book back to the grandson’s bedroom, adding humor and creating suspense. This combined with the fact that because the writer of the screenplay and the book was the same person, which helped keep the movie’s storyline very close to the book’s storyline, makes this movie better than any other movie I’ve seen that was based on a book.\r Another thing that makes it such a good movie is it’s diversity in it’s themes. It’s largest theme that encompasses the whole is that true love conquers all. Now that is a theme that, although may not always be true in real life, we all love because it makes us feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Another theme that it has is that the evil people in the world get what they deserve. This is another very watchable theme, who doesn’t like seeing the good guys win? The two very inspiring and heart-warming themes can make the audience get emotionally involved with the character in the movie. I found myself rooting for character and hoping that others died.\r The final thing that makes this movie so incredible is the way they build the characters. The characters in the movie are not just cookie cutter characters. They all have a good and a bad side that is built up throughout the movie by their interaction with other characters. Even the hero of the story has a bad side, he cheats to win a battle of wits. The dynamics of the characters really add to the story.\r Overall, The Princess Bride is an incredibly well done movie with great actors to play dynamic characters, touching themes, and a very unique way to tell the story. It is a must see for all of those who haven’t seen it and a movie you will want to watch again. If you don’t believe me or if you think it will be boring I leave you this quote from the movie. “Are you kidding? Its got fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles.”",

It is well designed, well directed and well acted. Rob Reiner is a very good director indeed, directing films like Stand By Me and all that. The film itself is beautiful, with lovely sets and costumes, matched with a funny and touching script, not to mention quotable. The story was simple, but very well-developed, with a few surprises here and there. As for the acting, it is superb. Cary Elwes is a very charismatic lead as Westley, and Robin Wright gives a very spirited performance as Princess Buttercup. Chris Sarandon is a little annoying, but he has some delicious throw-away lines, so you warm to him, especially when Westley insults him at the end. Wallace Shawn, Andre the Giant and Christopher Guest(who bares a mere resemblance to Tim Curry's Cardinal Richelieu) were very good too, as is an unrecognisable Billy Crystal. And Mandy Patinkin is deliciously hammy as the man who wishes to avenge his father's death by killing his six-fingered murderer. But what impressed me most were the funny interruptions with the grandfather(played wonderfully by Colombo's Peter Falk)and his sick grandson(Fred Savage). All in all, an original and funny movie that is a must see. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox.",

William Goldman's screenplay might be gripping and exhilarating but it surely isn't smart due to uneven pace that makes the audience uncomfortable and feel like something is missing and been skipped. Rob Reiner still needs to ante up the game for this time the feature got saved due to the enormous potential of its script. The feature majorly fails on performance too for no one delivers; which comes as a shock especially from Robin Wright, except from Mandy Patinkin. The Princess Bride has a simple familiar love story genre plot that only works due to its witty and sometimes humorous one-liners which helps resemble it to practicality.",

      "content": "This is one of those movies that almost everyone born in the Eighties has seen several times. I saw it myself, on television, even though I decided to revisit it now as my memory was no longer quite fresh. What I found is surprisingly worseThis is one of those movies that almost everyone born in the Eighties has seen several times. I saw it myself, on television, even though I decided to revisit it now as my memory was no longer quite fresh. What I found is surprisingly worse than I expected, but it didn't leave me totally disappointed.The story is based on a book and is very aimed at young audiences: a grandfather decides to read his sick grandson a fairy tale, recounting the ideal love between an orphan peasant girl transformed into a princess and her youth partner, who becomes a pirate to collect enough money for their wedding. To stay together, they will have to defeat a local king who is determined to marry her, then kill her and lead their country into war with a neighboring kingdom.Does the plot sound confusing? In fact, I thought of it that way too, but if we ignore the loose ends, it turns out to be fun and entertaining us perfectly. Set somewhere in medieval times, in a place that is also fictional, it has, however, some anachronisms: the character Inigo Montoya, for example, is a Spaniard who should have been Castilian or Aragonese, since Spain, as a country, appears later of the Middle Ages. And although piracy and swordplay are practically timeless, the weapons used in the film date back to the 17th century, which was the golden age of piracy par excellence. Details that, however, I did not take into account because the film is a fantasy and not a historical film.The cast is headed by Cary Elwes and Robin Wright. Both are the archetypal action hero and damsel in distress: slim, elegant, invariably blond and blue-eyed, he is a braggart, she is bland. The actors can be good, and they had other projects to prove it, but here they really don't have anything particularly remarkable to do. More interestingly, Mandy Patinkin's performance is full of Latin charisma and stereotypes, but I would say it's eerily similar to what Banderas would later do in \"The Mask of Zorro\". Was the actor inspired by Patinkin's work? Andre The Giant and Billy Crystal also deserve an applause for their work, with Crystal personifying moments of pure comedy. Chris Sarandon brought the villain to life in a conventional way, but collaborated very well with Christopher Guest.Technically, it's a forgettable film, that permanently reminds us not to take it too seriously: despite having a reasonable budget, it feels cheap and sloppy. The sets could hardly be more artificial, the sound effects are primitive (even by the standards of the time, which gave us technically superior films), the editing is uninteresting and the cinematography is ugly, with washed-out colors and very low contrast. The soundtrack, then, is truly disastrous, one of the worst I've heard. Of all these problems, the choice of some elegant and visually beautiful filming locations, good props, good makeup work and a very detailed wardrobe stand out.",

And the fact that this is the first time I watch it, and I don't feel that it has aged even a little bit is more than a proof of the movie's32 years since its release, it's safe to say that The Princess Bride is a timeless classic. And the fact that this is the first time I watch it, and I don't feel that it has aged even a little bit is more than a proof of the movie's immortality. But it's not only that it has stood the test of time; it seems that it also remain as subversive as it was back in the eighties. Imagine if Shrek's sarcastic tone and in-jokes didn't come at the expense of the heart of the story, and you would get this movie. (Except that the story is completely different, and it has no ogres, and ....... actually the movies are totally different from each other but you get the idea anyway!)With an awesome mix of swashbuckling, romance, comedy, fantastical elements, and insanely likable iconic character brought to life by a perfect cast, Rob Reiner put a magical spin on a happily-ever-after fairy tale and made it eternally fresh. But what stands out for me is the humor in particular. I was surprised by how the humor works perfectly well from the first second up to the very end of the movie. There is no single joke or gag that fails to land. The movie goes for the laughs relentlessly, and while this is a risk for sure; there are no joke that misses the mark. In fact, I couldn't stop giggling, and even laugh out loud, throughout this entire enjoyable adventure. I think the reason behind the movie's brilliant humor is that on the surface, the movie, of course, looks like an epic fantasy tale that its biggest concern is to show the heroic deeds of the protagonist and the lovely romantic relationship between him and his mistress; while Reiner insists, at any point of the movie no matter how serious it is, to take advantage of his eccentric characters and the fairly weird circumstances they face in an astonishing way leaning on the extremely witty dialogue and the charming cast.Unfortunately, I have some small issues with the movie. First, I think the movie could have been more heartwarming than it is simply by making the dialogue between the grandson and his grandpa half as smart and vivid as that of the fairy tale. The movie is full of heart, though, but largely due to the movie's sincerity and genuineness. Secondly, I guess the movie could have moved more gracefully and fluidly from an act to another, as I felt that the structure was a bit staged. Thirdly, the the third act seems as if it betrayed a certain message, or rather a certain underlying theme that it had been establishing throughout its first two acts. That said, the third act is utterly satisfying, and it proves that The Princess Bride is a very solid film that even its flaws can't be easily noticed or take away anything from watching it.Rob Reiner walks a very thin line between presenting a cute romantic damsel-in-distress story and a parody fairy tale. As a result, The Princess Bride is a good-hearted one-of-a-kind fantasy epic adventure of an enduring value.(8/10)",
