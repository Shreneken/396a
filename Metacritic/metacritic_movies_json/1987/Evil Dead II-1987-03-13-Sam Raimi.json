    "critic_reviews": [
        "The gaudily gory, virtuoso, hyper-kinetic horror sequel/remake uses every trick in the cinematic book, and confirms that Bruce Campbell and Raimi are gods.",
        "Using the same breathless pacing, rushing camera movements and nerve-jangling sound effects as before, Raimi drags us screaming into his cinematic funhouse. Delirious, demented and diabolically funny.",
        "Thanks to Sam Raimi\u2019s inventive style and Bruce Campbell\u2019s hysterical performance, the horror-comedy genre has grown into a legitimate genre, but Evil Dead 2 will forever be the king.",
        "I wholeheartedly love Evil Dead II. It's a great midnight movie, and one of the best horror-comedies ever made.",
        "In many ways even more hellish and stylish than its predecessor... A horror cult classic.",
        "Not so much a follow-up as a ruthless self-parody, Evil Dead II ranks as one of the most visually inventive, relentless, and truly original films ever made.",
        "But Evil Dead 2's rampant inventiveness and manic energy have ensured that it will endure as a cult classic.",
        "For those with a taste for outrageousness and an appetite for horror, there's no juicier meal than the Evil Dead movies.",
        "Sam Raimi\u2019s sequel/remake is full-on gore slapstick, more Tex Avery than Dario Argento.",
        "The grubby, low-budget intensity of the film gives it a lovable quality that high-tech movies wouldn't have.",
        "A deliriously cinematic experience for those with a taste for Grand Guignol, this is a relentlessly energetic nightmare world where quite literally anything can happen--and does.",
        "More an absurdist comedy than a horror film, Evil Dead II is a flashy good-natured display of special effects and scare tactics so extreme they can only be taken for laughs.",
        "The acting is straight out of '50s B movies. The exposition is clumsy, the sound track corny, the denouement silly. Then again, who said bad taste was easy? [13 Apr 1987, Style, p.b4]",
        "The effects are just as delirious this time around, but the nightmare poetry has vanished, along with the sense of archetypal purpose and narrative inevitability that held the jack-in-the-box original together."

Sam Raimi returns once again to the horrors of the Book of the Dead, along with star Bruce Campbell, the king of B-movies. The plot is pretty much the same as the original; Ash and his girlfriend Linda  venture to a cabin in the middle of a dark and unidentified forest. Ash finds a strange looking book and when he recites passages from it, he ressurects a dark spirit in the woods, and summons all kinds of crazy demons and monsters. The blood flies in some very imaginative ways. Heads get lopped off, demons get blown up and numerous people get zombified. It also has a focus on comedy thats just adds to how entertaining this movie really is. In sum, a great movie to watch on Halloween night an one of the most unique horror films around.",

I know that doesn't entirely mean that it is that good just because a magazine says so. But this was so interesting, I had to watch, and when I did, I was so confused. So from what I can tell this is the first horror movie to include intentional laughs in it, even before scream. So I thought: well this will be fun to watch. When it was done though, I had this feeling of me just not understanding why people love this movie so much. Personally I think the last one was okay, it definitely scared me at certain parts and was real gross. The same can be said for this; in my opinion. There're moments where it's being funny, more so than the last one, but only at one or two moments. This is probably most appreciated by those who really love horror, or just understand film a bit more than I do. Until I do understand, this film will be listed as: okay, in my book.",

Not a sequel so much as an elaborateMaximum visceral impact is what \"Evil Dead 2\" is all about-- and it delivers. The brilliance of \"Evil Dead 2\" is found in its psychotic blend of over-the-top gore, and it's fantastic sense of humor. Not a sequel so much as an elaborate do-over, \"Evil Dead 2\" amps up the ghastly laughs to generally thrilling results. As in the first film, director Sam Raimi lets out all the stops and plays on almost every cinematic trick in the book. Although the movie is obviously indebted to any number of sources, the film has an infectious energy all of its own.\r After a high-speed recap and continuation of first film's ending, Ash (Bruce Campbell) ventures out to that same lonely cabin for a romantic weekend with his girlfriend (Denise Bixler). There he discovers the same tape recorder again. When the voice reads a translation of the \"Book of the Dead,\" a vicious evil force awakens in the woods, and rushes into the house, and all hell breaks loose once more. Despite \"Evil Dead 2\" being more of a rehash than a sequel, it's the tone of the two movies that are significantly different. While the original is more of a conventional horror movie, the sequel ventures into full-blown surrealism. While both movies contain moments of humor, \"Evil Dead 2\" raises the comedic stakes.\r Campbell's performance shifts to match the needs of the humorous script, and Ash is now all swagger, spitting out one-liners and taking on the forces of darkness with style. The overall intensity and old-school effects give the film a lovable quality that high-tech movies just can't provide nowadays. An acknowledgement to Mark Shostrom's prosthetic makeup and the camera work of Peter Deming and Eugene Shlugleit. Vivid, utterly unique, and quickly paced, ''Evil Dead 2'' is one of the goofiest, goriest movies this side of the grave.",

As nightfall approaches,Ash must prepare again to battle the legions of the damned if he wants to make it to dawn.\rMy Review\rThe last time we saw Ash he was going insane and man the beginning of this one shows. He go's insane and that scene where he is laughing and he images the things around the house laughing really shows. Eventually the daughter of the first man who said those evil translations on the tape goes to the cabin and finds Ash and thinks he killed her mother and father when all along he's been trying to survive the evil they brought back once more. Bruce campbell still plays Ash with greatness i don't know the names of the other actors who played the other characters but i will say that they did great as well. I love how they change the evil zombie in the basement from the guys girlfriend to the womens mother and father.",

Like the first film, this film is incredibly gory and brutal and definitely not for the faint of heart. Overall, this is an outstandingly great film and even better sequel",

Evil Dead II is a worthy sequel of a classic, blending together horror and comedy, and throw in a little absurdity and over-the-top action sequences that will quench your thirst for gore. Though the film still suffers from cartoonish scenes and bland acting (except, of course Bruce Campbell), the films makes up for it by giving the viewers exactly what they want and more. Though the first film was leaning on more horror, and in my opinion, the best of the two, this still is one-of-a-kind and fresh, even though it's just another rehash of the previous film, although more action-packed and gratifying.",

You really never know what to expect as there are unpredictable moments that come one after another. It's all brought to life with visual effects and tricks that no one uses today anymore. Granted it looks dated, but it's visual tricks are still all the more exciting and different. It's clear that this is pure imaginative horror-comedy.\r I just wish it was more horror and less comedy. It's not a scary movie. It's also not a particularly funny one. It's still entertaining, but it's strength lies in it's incredible weirdness as well as with Raimi's imaginatively twisted scenes and Campbell's performance. It's easy to see why this one became a cult-classic. It's unlike anything you've ever seen before and I really wish more horror movies would be this unique nowadays. It's not the best horror-comedy, but it's still worth a watch for hardcore genre fans. Overall I give it a 6.8/10.",

''Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn'' is no different than ''The Evil Dead'', because they're practically the same movie, only with slightly better effects and SOME interesting things, maybe 1 or 2. That's why i gave it 1.5/5 in stead of 0.5/5\r Since ''The Evil Dead'', and ''Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn'', are practically the same movie (It isnt a sequel, it's just a remake with a slightly bigger budget.) my exact critcisms apply for this movie too. I, yet again, thought this movie was neither funny nor scary at all. (Except, again, the awfully cheap jump scares, which is just a talentless way of scaring the audience) The acting is horrendous and hammy (yet again), there is no atmospheric tension (yet again), and the movie's scares solely rely on jump scares and gore, which is the worst kind of horror, the plot is extremely simple yet it has many plot holes (Less than the first one however), the solution to the film's main problem is abominable (It made even less sense than in the first one), the structure/ outline of the story is pretty bad too. It is cheesy, silly and poorly made, with awful acting and many filming and continuity errors.\r I have nothing more to say, except that i'm even less excited for ''Army of Darkness'' than i was after watching ''The Evil Dead''",

Everything about this is pretty much spot on. There is plenty of violence, there is much comedy, it is very fast paced yet it still remains jumpy and edgy. It really has to be seen for anyone who even has a passing interest in horror. This is the pinnacle of the series, it takes everything that was setup in the first film and builds upon it. The third film has a more action orientated and the \u2018remake\u2019 more of a horror leaning, the series is probably the most similar of the following franchise entries. This is not a remake of the first but the first 6 minutes is a recap. The rest is a rollercoaster of horrific images and stunning effects considering the budget with insanely over-the-top acting and enough dark humour to keep anyone happy.

Which doesn't mean he can't be serious.You can laugh at his grandiose funny moments, but you can also take them seriously.It's very rare for a character in a horror movie to go through such character development.One of the few horror movies where I can believe that the character is as strong as his opponents.This film is incredibly creative and the practical effects are still worth seeing today.In the fights between Ash and Henrietta and Ash and rotten apple head you can see what you can do with the right budget.The secondary characters also worked well in the film and I love how Army of Darkness is built on.The plot isn't the focus, but Ash's development into a unique character that has gone down in pop culture history.This film has endless iconic scenes.E.g. the scene where Ash saws off his hand, the dance scene of Linda, the head scene of Linda, the fight against Henrietta and rotten apple head, the scene where Ash replaces his hand with a chainsaw, the scenes with Ash's possessed hand, the surprising one end, etc. But what was funny about the film? The plot isn't funny, and the characters don't make many jokes. Most of the scary scenes are also the funny scenes.It's the implementation.Even the exposition scene is visually beautifully implemented.Even the demons still look impressive today.The practical effects never disappoint in an evil dead film anyway.",
