    "critic_reviews": [
        "Directed by John McTiernan, it\u2019s an \u201980s classic full of still-thrilling action, quotable one-liners (\u201cGet to the chopper!\u201d \u201cStick around!\u201d) and sly digs at Uncle Sam\u2019s penchant for unwinnable jungle wars.",
        "The film tackles an age-old theme of man versus monster, but does so in a way that creates a strangely perfect balance between action, science fiction, and even a dash of horror.",
        "Predator is a classic action/sci-fi film, albeit a dated action/sci-fi film.",
        "Structurally, Predator is a classic behind-enemy-lines/buddy movies. Nothing much new, just well done.",
        "Moves at a breakneck pace, it has strong and simple characterizations, it has good location photography and terrific special effects, and it supplies what it claims to supply: an effective action movie.",
        "It's got thrills and chills and one of the most elegantly conceived monsters in the history of movies.",
        "Crisply stylish and suspenseful, making brilliant use of optical special effects, Predator is one of Schwarzenegger's best.",
        "A slightly above-average actioner that tries to compensate for tissue-thin-plot with ever-more-grisly death sequences and impressive special effects.",
        "Despite the off-rhythm styling and suggestions of primeval menace, there's really not much going on here.",
        "Alternately grisly and dull, with few surprises.",
        "Frankly, scarier critters have checked into Roach Motels.",
        "It's arguably one of the emptiest, feeblest, most derivative scripts ever made as a major studio movie. There's no need to do a Mad magazine movie parody of this; it's already on the screen."

Then it depends on how scary it is or how destructive it is. This movie is a action horror. But with Arnold Swachenegger in it was more action than horror. Doesn't matter, it all tied up when Arnold was being hunted by the PREDATOR. The universes best hunter ever, until it met Arnold. They both gave each other hell. Arnold gave the predator hell because he was sent in the middle of the jungle to help a team distress call. But instead he and his team find nothing but skinned soldiers and of course the predator. The PREDATOR gave him hell because its his right of passage to become a \"man\". All together the movie was awesome. Not the best graphics you ever saw but still what a movie. Thumbs up.",

Arnold ends up defeating it but by surprise he didn't kill it in the end, the predator kills itself when it saw no other way to win. this movie is so awesome that it makes me wish they left it alone and didn't make many sequels, having said that I am looking forward to The Predator this year which i will review after i see it.",

Schwarzenegger is the greatest and also, for the add, BIGGEST action star of all-time, so he really makes this film what it is. I love it in every way. The incredible shoot-locations, pretty awesome dialogue, Science-Fiction, violence, plot and more. It's all great. I rate Predator a 10/10 as it's my all-time favourite film.

It's not difficult to see why. John McTiernan's direction is claustrophobic, fluid and assured, staging the action with aplomb but concentrating just as much on tension and atmosphere.\r It's cheesy as hell, of course, but enormously entertaining and deeply cool, with a ton of quotable lines - 'I ain\u00edt got time to bleed' - while The Predator itself is an utterly unforgettable villain. But most bad guys are only as good as their heroes and, long before he became a shambling self-parody, Arnie delivers - and not just in the walking and talking without falling over sense. He's an awesomely indestructible figure here, at the height of his physical powers. He's the archetypal immovable force meeting an irresistible object. Only Arnie at his most iconic could convincingly defeat the Predator (as those who've seen Danny Glover in 'Predator 2' know).\r There's also something ironic in the climax, where immigrant Arnie - now fully embraced by the U.S. - kicks the tar out of a real illegal alien. We could go into the sexual subtext, but maybe we're just reading too much into it.\r A thumping piece of powerhouse cinema.",

(and the costume itself has set an industry standard).10/10",

The pace is bad, the plot unstructured, the acting is poor (excepting for Dillon who is embodied by Carl Weathers), the end is as long and boring as predictable, we don't know anything about the Predator, characters are pale stereotypes (with the notable excption of Billy, played by Sonny Landham), the whole story is just a runaway/embush plot, there is no balance between the opponents, the characters have no depth, the so-called thermic-view scenes are lame and visually disgusting.I however have to admit that the soundtrack is great, the special effects are impressive, some lines are iconic (in the middle of dumb dialogues), the weapons are powerful and the jungle looks awesome. Only one scene, when they attack the guerila camp is awesome, but the movie sadly struggles in maintaining a decent level of tension among all these useless scenes and unequal battles. Nothing more to add: it is boring, empty, and ends up in striking nonsense (why doesn't the Predator see Dutch when he is covered of mud ? I thought it could detect warmth ? Why and how did Dutch survive the laser blast since it killed many of its brothers id arms ? Why does the Predator play so long with him rather than to immediately kill him and transform him into a trophy ? Why will so many questions remain unanswered ?).",

He takes a team of elite commando's to rescue some hostages in this jungle like setting and finds out most of not all have been made a corpse out of. He attacks some little village with his team, killing patrol guards and even takes one of he women but whether she's a hostage or member of the villains isn't explained. Anyway the badguy soldiers get killed, there are bullets, bombs and explosions going off and the area is secured. Then Arnold Schwarzenegger and his commando team must make it to the border presumably for pick up/collection by a chopper but is hunted by an extraterrestrial invisible and visible alien creature who has cool firing gadgets lol. The predator slays all of Schwarzenegger's soldier team members one by one using different methods of killing. He can see the heats of human body's and this is how he hunts and the soldiers and Arnold Schwarzenegger are carrying weapons so don't do themselves no favours. Packed with entertainment, suspense, bad language, blood, explosions and the usual violence and special effects I'd say Predator is a classic but certainly not better than earlier films such as Raw Deal made in 1986... Predator also stars Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham, Jesse Ventura, Kevin Peter Hall as the predator.",

The look of the creature and the special effects are quite dated by now.

Yes you have Arnold Schwarzenegger who is of cause a badass but his whole squad are also badasses that would do well in every action movie. Their enemies are no match for them as they clearly out gun them with ease. Then comes the Predator who delivers these battle hardened men a feeling of dread, fear and hopelessness. It is a naked battle for survival against a superior enemy that outmanoeuvres them easily. This is the strength of the movie. It delivers this serious threat and the impact perfectly. It gets even more intense the longer the movie goes. Then there is the final battle which I wont spoil. Its a battle of wits. Each one knows the strengths of their enemies and try to outmanoeuvre the other. As far as action movies go this is one of the best if not best and a cult classic. Each sequel tries to recapture this formula but so far all have failed.",

I thought it was fun, likable and efficient above other things. I revisited it again some time ago again, and was waiting for the opportunity to say that it has quickly become a favourite of mine. As far as John McTiernan's movies go, I think Die Hard is his best movie but Predator is for me definitely up there with his best. It is everything I thought it to be as a child and more.The action is exhilarating and kept at a snappy pace with enough suspense to thrill, while the special effects are truly excellent, they are memorable, look great and enhance rather than distract. The characterisation is also good, the story is gripping, Alan Silvestri's score is terrific, the pace is snappy, McTiernan's direction is efficient and the dialogue is quotable. The acting I have no problems with either, Arnold Schwarznegger gives one of his most charismatic, efficient and likable performances here.Overall, a great film and a classic of its decade. It may be a little too long perhaps, but it is great fun and works on all levels. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

After I reviewed all of the Alien films I decided I would now review Predator which it stars ArnoldIn many respects, Predator is part of the Alien merchandise which is why there is a spin-off film to it called Alien vs. Predator. After I reviewed all of the Alien films I decided I would now review Predator which it stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and many more. It's not even a horror film, it's more like an action sci-fi film which occasionally had some scares. It's nothing that scary apart from when it's quiet. There occasionally have some blood and guts for the most part. The opening is pretty impressive and the ending is spectacular. the story is very basic, simple and straight forward. I know that years ago critics giving it mixed reviews saying the story is too flat and paper thinned, I can see why. The third act is where Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dutch being very quiet trying to kill the predator once and for all. The third act doesn't even have any dialogue apart from the end where he says ''Bleed, b!\u00a3$%^d.'' and the one that everybody says it's a memorable line in the movie industry is ''You one ugly motherf$%ker.'' I know there's plenty to go around but that's the way the movie goes. There's another memorable that Schwarzenegger said. All he said is ''Get to the chopper!'' I just realise that years back! Oh, oh, and if you think that is not enough? Why don't you take a look at this! Blain played by Jesse Ventura says a line that I know as a kid is that Jonah from Splashdown 2: Rides Gone Wild fails, he says ''I ain't got time to bleed.'' and wouldn't you know it? Jesse says it. Oh, Jesus, if many of the characters ripping off the films that many of the actors said, this game would be pop culture. Maybe Jesse Ventura have got time to duck. it really had an all star cast who are in the jungle. It has Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Elpidia Carrillo, Jesse Ventura, Richard Chaves, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham, Shane Black and then there's Kevin Peter Hall as the Predator. It shows the from the beginning of the end credits which is really impressive. Bill Duke also worked with Arnold Schwarzenegger in Commando which is rather usual. He played a bad guy in Commando and now he played a good guy in Predator. Shane Black's character is the character who tells Billy laugh by telling his puxxy jokes. He only did it about two times. Billy played by Sonny Landham is afraid of no man. Now the Predator is in the jungle to kill people and take their body of bones out of their skins and camouflages like a chameleon and can make himself disappear. If you think Aliens isn't enough? Then you've haven't seen Predator with some action packed thrills and occasional scares and a straight forward simple basic story. I love the opening and I love the ending. I would actually prefer the Alien films because they're really scary film and it will scare the living s\u00a3!t out of you and me. Predator is just your good action sci-fi flick directed by the same guy who directed one of my favourite films of all time Die Hard, John McTiernan. It has some good effects on the predator and yeah, that's about it. There're sometimes one-liners in this from Schwarzenegger are too vague like ''Stick around.'' and ''Knock knock.'' but that's only two times. And you will the predator bleed showing green blood because if it bleeds, we can kill it. \"You one ugly motherf\u00a3$ker.''",

Second: The music of the movie is thrilling, manly and penetrating which makes the atmosphere exactly like to be in a dangerous jungle. Every scene has it's own music which makes suspense even better. Third: The script: to the point and straight forward for the elite squad who are the hunters, until it makes a twist, and when the Predator came they become hunted. Fourth: The characters are simply perfect and there is no other actors who could play these roles as better as them. The general - excellent, with few lines and exact orders. Dutch - the perfect leader, strong, the biggest of the group, muscular as hell, composed and collected. Dillon - a little smaller than Dutch, cunning and determined to fulfill his own mission, after all succeeded until the moment the Predator came. Anna - great as portraying their prisoner. Mac - the best acting in the movie of all the actors in it, first in the scene where he saw the Predator, second after the shooting and third - his monologue about his buddy Blane. Blane - excluding Dutch, the biggest macho in the squad, and in real life the only actor in the movie who actually experienced war and being a real soldier. Billy - the powerful, big, strange, dark and foreboding Indian with his own code of war. Poncho - tough, almost as the big guys and with great lines in the movie, always helps when it counts. Hawkins - the perfect radio soldier with the sexist jokes to cheer up the others, and he would've been distinctive without his glasses. The Predator - great super tall actor who makes Dutch look small.Fifth - The effects - way ahead of it's time. Great even watching at 2016. May be the best effects an action movie ever made. Sixth - The lines - How can you forget: \"Get to the chopper!\", \"If it bleeds we can kill it!\", \"Any time.\", \"I ain't got time to bleed\", \"Stick around\", \"You're one ugly mother f&ck&r\" and many more. Seventh - The atmosphere of the movie is makes you feel you are one of them or the Predator. Hence: if you're an Action Sci-Fi Horror fan this is the best movie for you. For me it's the best of all time, because I've watched it more than 500-600 times and still watch it today.",
