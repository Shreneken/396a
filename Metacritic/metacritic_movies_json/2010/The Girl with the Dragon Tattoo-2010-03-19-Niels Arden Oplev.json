    "summary": "Forty years ago, Harriet Vanger disappeared from a family gathering on the island owned and inhabited by the powerful Vanger clan. Her body was never found, yet her uncle is convinced it was murder and that the killer is a member of his own tightly knit but dysfunctional family. He employs disgraced financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist andForty years ago, Harriet Vanger disappeared from a family gathering on the island owned and inhabited by the powerful Vanger clan. Her body was never found, yet her uncle is convinced it was murder and that the killer is a member of his own tightly knit but dysfunctional family. He employs disgraced financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist and the tattooed, ruthless computer hacker Lisbeth Salander to investigate. When the pair link Harriet's disappearance to a number of grotesque murders from almost forty years ago, they begin to unravel a dark and appalling family history. But the Vanger's are a secretive clan, and Blomkvist and Salander are about to find out just how far they are prepared to go to protect themselves. \"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\" is based on the trilogy of books by Stieg Larsson and has sold over 7 million copies worldwide. Tragically, Larsson did not live to see the phenomenon his work has become as he died suddenly in 2004 soon after delivering the manuscripts to his Swedish publisher. (Music Box Films)\u2026 Expand",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "A compelling thriller to begin with, but it adds the rare quality of having a heroine more fascinating than the story.",
        "It's one of the most engaging foreign films to come along since 'Tell No One' in 2008.",
        "Tattoo is as much mood piece as mystery, and the mood is almost always disturbing.",
        "The key to the film\u2019s effectiveness is the casting of Rapace, who, while not mapping quite exactly to the book\u2019s physical descriptions, is riveting.",
        "Rapace is a magnetic presence in a far-ranging mystery requiring such a solid character to orbit around.",
        "A mind-bending and mesmerizing thriller that takes its time unlocking one mystery only to uncover another, all to chilling and immensely satisfying effect.",
        "Rife with nightmarishly violent and horrific behavior. It's intense, graphic, frightening.",
        "This dynamite thriller shivers with suspense. So if you ignore The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo) because it's in Swedish with English subtitles, you probably deserve the remake Hollywood will surely screw up.",
        "The biggest compliment you can pay the much-anticipated film adaptation of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is that you can't imagine Stieg Larsson's corker of a story ever having existed in book form.",
        "Balances character development with plot, and that's crucial to its success.",
        "A chilling detective tale, a horrific sexual abuse drama and an overlong, emotional, tie-up-every-loose-end melodrama that is sure to be half an hour shorter when Hollywood remakes it without the Swedish dialogue and probably without the cool Swedish edge.",
        "May be a shallower experience than the book, but it has a headlong velocity all its own. Catch it before the inevitable U.S. remake.",
        "Every so often, you get the gift of watching an under-the-radar actor bloom into a critical-mass phenomenon before your bloodshot eyes: Franka Potente in \"Run Lola Run,\" or Christoph Waltz in \"Inglourious Basterds.\" Add Noomi Rapace to the list; what she does with the title character of this Swedish thriller-cum-pop-lit-adaptation will spawn cults of swooning Rapacephiles stat.",
        "A stylish thriller with real complexity, people with interesting faces, a sensational actress cast as an ambisexual Goth hacker heroine--the news about The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is nothing but good.",
        "I finished Larsson's novel with the uncomfortable sense it used a good mystery as an excuse to dwell on sadism and perversity -- an aspect only exacerbated on screen.",
        "The feminist subtext should come as no surprise given Larsson's lifelong advocacy on social-justice issues, but it also is a refreshing slant on the familiar character dynamics of crime fiction.",
        "This is not your mother's murder mystery, unless your mother's maiden name is de Sade and she has an appallingly bleak vision of modern society that occasionally fixates on the historical misdeeds of the corporate/industrial world and the correction thereof.",
        "The film makes excellent use of the cold Scandinavian landscape to emphasize the story's gloomy loneliness. And Rapace and ? Nyqvist have compelling chemistry.",
        "The movies rarely gives us a woman as fascinatingly complex as Lisbeth Salander, and the happiest news about the two sequels is that she\u2019ll be back.",
        "A potboiler but entertaining enough to rise above its flaws.",
        "It's the rare 2 1/2 -hour film that doesn't make you look at your watch once. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is such a film.",
        "The result is a finely plotted, stylishly photographed and brilliantly acted whodunit that clocks in at 2 1/2 hours but never seems long.",
        "Lisbeth, pierced, tattooed and played by Rapace with a sometimes uncontrolled ferocity, qualifies as both a victim of male violence and a violent avenger of it. This makes her a lot more compelling than her comparatively passive partner -- something that Hollywood will doubtless find it necessary to \"remedy\" when Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is remade in English.",
        "Its stylish and gritty authenticity is superbly suited to this murder mystery.",
        "This Swedish sensation is a magic trick that jolts the murder-mystery genre back to life.",
        "A chilling film best experienced bundled up in a sweater and scarf.",
        "Here\u2019s a paradox: The millions of people who have read Stieg Larsson\u2019s The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo are the panting target audience for the Swedish-language film adaptation. Yet they\u2019re also likeliest to be disappointed by this carefully crafted drama, while people who haven\u2019t read the book are likely to enjoy the movie and wonder what the literary fuss is about.",
        "The result is a character-driven mystery of considerable emotional power, often harrowing and always compelling.",
        "However you respond to it, the fraught sexual and investigative chemistry between Mikael and Lisbeth is the most powerful ingredient of Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. The movie's second half is a capably executed but mostly by-the-numbers procedural.",
        "Noomi Rapace throws herself into the title role, but something about the conception of her character, and about the far-reaching urgency of the sociopathic shocks behind the killing, smacks of a filmmaker pushing too hard. That is why the movie finds it impossible to wind things up.",
        "The film version stars a wonderful Swedish-Icelandic actress named Noomi Rapace as the hacker and Michael Nyqvist as the reporter. They are excellent and subtle and honest.",
        "A dark and brooding story that only gets more disturbing over the course its 152 minute runtime.",
        "More of an action-light whodunit than a real thriller, and more of a CliffsNotes version than a deeply disturbing portrait of what's wrong with contempo Sweden.",
        "Director Niels Arden Oplev keeps the action relatively tight. But he revels in the story\u2019s sadism to an uncomfortable degree, especially in a needlessly vile rape scene. Two more sequels are coming. Here\u2019s hoping there\u2019s just a little less hate in each.",
        "The cluttered narrative leaves little room for character development, though director Niels Arden Oplev does manage to accommodate plenty of gratuitous torture and rape.",
        "Though Ms. Rapace is a fine professional scowler, with cheekbones that thrust like knives and a pout that\u2019s mostly pucker, she tends to register as an intriguing idea instead of a thoroughly realized character. She more or less looks the part that the filmmakers don\u2019t let her fully play."

The storytelling is fluid and engaging, the script tight and the dramatic performances superb. The film explores the darkest, most depraved aspects of human nature, and astutely questions our commonly held beliefs about mental illness, morality and redemption. It's a real testament to the skills of leads Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace that they manage to bring such complex, layered characters to life on the big screen, and they make a great double-act, smartly playing off each others' performances to add greater depth and believability to their roles. It's also a mark of a great director in Niels Arden Oplev that he keeps the story focussed, and manages to maintain the momentum of the film throughout its 150 minute run-time. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is simply superb - it's smart, energetic, well-crafted and utterly enthralling. The American remake is on the horizon, and while I'm intrigued by any project with David Fincher at the helm, I'm also a little dubious, because there's no way a remake can be this good.",

Specific details created for the characters and world they live by the book's author are truly unique and come alive through dedicated actors.

It wasn't enough to make my stomach turn, but my female companion certainly wasn't too comfortable with what was going on. Later in the film, I got my own taste of that feeling. Because if The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo offers anything, sexual/graphic violence are at the top of the list.Okay, if you're still reading, this could be a film you would enjoy. The movie is a Swedish production (English subtitles) and is an adaptation of the first book in author Stieg Larsson's award-winning series. From what I gather, the film remains extremely faithful to the book, all the way to a nearly two and a half hour run time. The story is quite twisted and is rather well woven with many layers. The main plot revolves around a hot-shot reporter who has fallen on hard times (read: going to prison because he's been found guilty of libel) and is now hired by a dying old man to find his niece that has been missing for 40 years. Pretty standard stuff, until the pieces begin falling into place, and we learn that the main suspects are all family members. Then all bets are off and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo steams ahead as disturbing details are discovered one after another. As far as the story goes, it's a little better than your average mystery. It keeps you guessing and there are plenty of suspects to choose from. The real gem of the film is in the character of Lisbeth Salander (played by Noomi Rapace), she of \"girl with the dragon tattoo\" fame. Lisbeth has been spying on Mikael Blomkvist (our unfortunate reporter) and unintentionally ends up getting herself involved in his latest project. Her character is a very complicated one. She's a hacker, covered in piercings, smokes like a chimney to calm herself down, has a very hidden and dark past including criminal activity, is withdrawn and stand-offish and yet she ends up being almost lovable. Rapace's performance is definitely a highlight of the movie. She manages Lisbeth's facial expressions and moods with ease and gives us exactly what Larsson wanted the character to be. Unfortunately, her supporting cast and the general low-budget feel of the film don't do her any favors... she can't save it on her own.The \"book vs. movie\" debate is alive and well here. Despite being a cinema lover, I usually prefer the book, and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo did nothing to change my mind. It's a decent thriller, but the unnecessarily violent sex scenes and nature of the crimes act as shock value and don't add much meaningful to the story. However, I commend the director for staying true to the book and being unafraid to depict these same scenes as they were written. If that sounds like a bit of a contradiction, it is. And that is where I am left when it comes to my thoughts on the film - confused.I enjoyed it well enough, but was not blown away or inspired or emotionally riveted. I will definitely be viewing the sequels if for no other reason than to see more of Rapace, but the movie did offer up a solid crime mystery and for that I'll consider it slightly above average.",

Inside of five minutes we're presented with a television reporter doing a typical live shot from outside a courthouse. Well, typical in every way except that she's prominently, ostentatiously pregnant.Ah. Female power. Gotcha. In the ensuing two hours we learn that women are lesbians because they were raped as children. That women are smarter and stronger than men. That victims are allowed to be warped by their past but that criminals are not. And that it's quite OK for a female to play the traditional male role and for the male to more or less play the traditional female role. That last one is especially OK because the female in question happens to be the very best thing about this movie. Her name's Noomi Rapace and she plays a pierced, tattooed punkish girl with a very violent streak who also happens to be a whiz at the internet thingie and has a crackerjack memory. I'd like to say she's complicated but that's being a bit generous to the writer,  Swedish novelist Stieg Larsson.  But she is interesting in a malevolent, raped-as-a-child kind of way. Rapace becomes entangled in the life of an investigative journalist who's hired to solve a 40 year-old case of a missing girl.  And if Rapace is the best thing about this movie, then the impact she has on his life, thin gruel though it may be, is the second best. Third best is the actual plot of the movie, a somewhat complicated whodunnit replete with sex, sadism and, of course, murder. Salacious stuff somehow rendered limp, save for a handful of electric scenes with Rapace and her probation officer. I understand that Larsson wrote three novels based on these characters, popped them off to his publisher, then dropped dead. He never saw them become an international success. I also understand that this Swedish movie (with subtitles) is the first of three films to be based on his books. In the next film I look forward to seeing how Rapace's character develops and grows. She's really quite interesting. And I hold out hope that the girl power message is supported by stronger story and is energized by a director with a more skillful grasp of pacing and tension.",

There was a tragic story that I found behind the making of those books. When Larsson was 15 years old, he witnessed the gang rape of a young girl. He never forgave himself for failing to help that poor girl at that time. The girl name was Lisbeth. Thiz movie is the first adaptation of those trilogy books. Sometimes, I found myself enjoying so much pleasure by watching European movies like thiz Scandinavian movie. The movie fills with splendid Cinematoraphy. I had ever thought that High Definition (HD) Camera would not be able to accomplishing thiz kind of remarkable views. I was wrong, many nowadays Director are still able to create a great nuance with precise treatment through their HD Cameras, sometimes even better. The movie directed by Niels Arden Oplev. The story tells about the troubled journalist Mikael Blomkvist has to work side by side with a genius punk-goth Hacker, Lisbeth Salander in order to solve a mystery about a missing young girl named Harriet, for the event that had been occurred 40 years ago, as the demand of a billionaire industrialist, Henrik Vanger. I have to mention that Sven-Bertil Taube has made a solid performance as Henrik Vanger. Michael Niqvist is very convincing to create his dual-side character as Mikael Blomkvist. And surely, the most memorable performance is belongs to Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander. I realize that those characters are so difficult to play (especially the two main characters, Blomkvist and Salander) bcoz of their complicated backgrounds. I simply called thiz movie as: Classic thriller with Modern contents. Classic which is making us pay attention to clue by clue to get closer to the hidden villain. It is what Classic thrillers do. Modern which is flooding with audacious elements, such as: The anti-hero characters, ironical sexual abuse scene, unusual moral conflict and many more. I heard that next year, they are remaking thiz movie into Hollywood version. My opinion is: do not expect too much, although The Director will be David Fincher, who is capable to translate dark tone into intriguing crime thrillers like thiz, he has already proved that through SE7EN (1995), FIGHT CLUB (1999), and THE ZODIAC (2005). The newest James Bond, Daniel Craig will be cast as Mikael Blomkvist and Rooney Mara (THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010)) will be playing as Lisbeth. I think no matter how hard they will try. Thiz Swedish movie has already set up the bar so high and seems undefeated at thiz time.\r Visit My Blog on JONNY\u00e2",

I thought it was an excellent adaptation considering the amount of material.  The cast was superb and the setting was beautiful.  I am not sure why America has to remake it, but David Fincher is an excellent director and he can of course change certain elements of the film by adding material that were left out of the Swedish version.  Now casting the role of Lisbeth will be challenging because Noonmi Rapace's performance was superb.  I do have one HUGE complaint, however.  We rented the film from Netflix and watched the previews.  Well, to my shock and dismay, the preview began for the SEQUEL, The Girl Who Played With Fire.  Before I could react quick enough to locate the remote and hit the menu button, I heard/saw info about one of the major characters.  Talk about a spoiler.  I am currently reading TGWPWF and am only on about page 160-170.  I  was sooo disappointed and angry.   Why on earth would anyone show the preview for a SEQUEL in the first part of the series???????  Imagine if when The Godfather premiered, the trailer for The Godfather II was shown before the movie.  Unbelievable.",

It is easily seen as a successful task of turning a work of literature into film. It has done Larsson's books a great justice!\r It is dark, curious, brooding, violent, and thrilling. The settings of the film's scenes were unimaginably dead-on from the book. The character casting and cinematography are astonishing.\r The financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist, played by Michael Nyqvist, is a mix of wit, steadfastness, and even a edge of humor. He is intelligent, and pairs well with the bright and dynamic Lisbeth.\r Lisbeth Salander, played by Noomi Rapace, was casted wonderfully  if not perfectly. Her edge, look, and body language really brought life to the character of Lisbeth. Lisbeth's past has set her present and maybe even future in the unsteady hands of the corrupt. The two stories of Blomkvist and Salander stand aside, overlap, intertwine, and come together in a wonderful pace. A 40-year old crime is dropped in the lap of Blomkvist to decipher once and for all  contending with his own battles in the eyes of politics and financial journalism. Salander, the reserved technology-driven hacker, whom is assigned cases by a security company, is researching Blomkvist. Her life, ruled by her hard past and difficult present, draws you in and doesn't let you go.

Skillfully directed byI certainly must not have been the only one to discover this film via it's American \"twin brother\". I did not read the book to judge how the adaptation did it justice, but I have faith that it would have been excellent. Skillfully directed by Neil Arden Oplev, this Swedish film was also my first contact with Scandinavian cinema.I do not know if it's worthwhile to dwell on the plot, which begins with the investigation of a disappearance in a very rich and powerful family to give rise to a tense and appealing story of mystery surrounding a murderer of women. It is a dense film, with a lot of tension and characters full of personality and easy to like. Of course, the leading role goes entirely to the unfortunate journalist Mikael Blomkvist and his occasional collaborator Lisbeth Salander, a punk hacker with a past of violence and delinquency. The film knows perfectly how to build a tense and mysterious environment, and play with it to keep the audience watching.The cast has several names in Swedish cinema that are naturally unknown to me because I am far from being a minimal connoisseur of this cinematic universe. Anyway, I really liked Michael Nyqvist's performance, but the extraordinary Noomi Rapace steals all the attention whenever she appears. She is truly talented and has grasped her character with determination, willing to show value. And so it was!Technically, I would like to highlight the excellent quality of cinematography and the work of filming and editing. The film is long, almost three hours long and in some versions (perhaps the most dedicated to TV) it appears divided in two halves ... but it is totally worth it and if the audience is carried away, they will not even feel the time passing. The effects are minimal, but they fulfill their role, the dialogues are excellent and the lines work very well. The sets and costumes, as well as the Swedish landscapes (with or without snow) increase the visual beauty of the whole ensemble. The soundtrack does its job well.",
