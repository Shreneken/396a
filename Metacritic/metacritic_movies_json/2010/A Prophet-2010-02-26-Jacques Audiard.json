  "critic_reviews": [
    "Why do we care? Because never before have the steps to thugdom, as depressing as that destination may be, been so rigorously detailed, neither romanticized nor negated. Don’t miss.",
    "There's also no romanticizing on the part of the director, who proceeds with calm, unshowy attentiveness (even in the midst of scenes of violence), creating a stunning portrait of an innately smart survivor for whom prison turns out to be a twisted opportunity for self-definition.",
    "Uncompromising in its style, story and characterizations.",
    "To borrow a marketing phrase from another, very different film, A Prophet really is the movie that reminds you why you love the movies. Especially movies like this one.",
    "One of those rare films in which the moral stakes are as insistent and thought through as the aesthetic choices.",
    "A new crime classic.",
    "It's a highly original film made in a familiar context, and an exciting moviegoing experience you shouldn't miss.",
    "The best performance in the film is by Arestrup as Cesar. You may remember him from Audiard's \"The Beat That My Heart Skipped\" (2005), where he played a seedy but confident father who psychically overshadows his son.",
    "One caveat: At the risk of sounding sexist, let me say A Prophet is an unreservedly male film. Female characters are few and far between, and when they do appear, they pretty much fall into either one of two categories – les mamans ou les putains.",
    "If Malik doesn't remind you of Al Pacino's Michael Corleone on his journey from innocence to corruption in \"The Godfather\" saga, well . . . he should. A Prophet is similarly, startlingly momentous.",
    "A Prophet is the kind of film that makes you remember why going to the movies can be a thrilling experience.",
    "Essential viewing for art-film buffs and crime-flick fans, but also for anyone who's looking for a great story, terrific acting and masterful filmmaking.",
    "More than anything else, however, director Jacques Audiard's gritty, grab-you-by-the-shirtfront film is a mob movie -- a really, really good mob movie. Think \"GoodFellas,\" but with Gauloises and accent aigu instead of plates of spaghetti and accent Pesci.",
    "A Prophet has been compared to American TV series like \"Oz\" for its episodic plot and large cast, but it’s more like a Gallic \"Goodfellas\": thoroughly absorbing, exciting, even poetic. It’s a full evening’s entertainment.",
    "Long and sometimes grueling, but it never feels indulgent or excessive.  In order to be subtle about the horrifying transformation he records, Audiard needs to let it unfold slowly, so that only when we reach the end can we see Malik as a new man who has come unimaginably -- and terribly -- far.",
    "A Prophet pushes its protagonist into circumstances he did not choose but in which he watches and learns and kills and eventually becomes all he can be, albeit criminally. Certainly Muslims living in France have embraced the movie and Malik, played by Rahim",
    "It’s imperfect, but it’s daring, bold, and from a director who isn’t scared of anything.",
    "Most prison movies are about escape or survival. A Prophet (Un Prophete) is about the creation of a consciousness. This one, too, could have been called “An Education.”",
    "Audiard delivers on and exceeds the promise he evinced in that earlier film, drawing viewers into the densely layered, ruthless ecology of a French prison and, against all odds, making them not mind staying there awhile.",
    "Strip away the French and Arabic subtitles, the French-prison setting and the Muslim-messianic title, and A Prophet, opening Friday at The Enzian, would still be the grittiest prison thriller in years.",
    "Though less pleasurably offbeat than the helmer’s well-received “Read My Lips” and “The Beat That My Heart Skipped,” this is solid, sinewy pulp fiction.",
    "A modern French crime epic where the smudges and crossings out do not diminish the passages of great dreamlike power.",
    "What's most immediately remarkable about the film is the raw intensity of its hyper-realistic encounters, hugely enhanced by the superb acting of newcomer Rahim.",
    "Whether audiences have the stomach for 150 minutes behind bars remains debatable, but there is no denying the persuasive power of a film that takes no prisoners and pulls no punches.",
    "Rahim and Arestrup are both so outstanding that if this were an English-language film, they'd probably be nominated for Oscars, too.",
    "Some have compared this French crime drama to \"The Godfather,\" and though that may be a common critical touchstone, writer-director Jacques Audiard manages to replicate its most elusive element, not the dark comedy or the operatic bloodletting but the incremental corruption of a decent man into a willful, coldhearted killer.",
    "If his two previous films suggested a director dipping a few toes in dark waters, Un Prophete marks the moment when Audiard took the plunge.",
    "Jacques Audiard’s film, which lasts two and a half hours, maintains an unflagging urgency, stalling only when the double-dealing grows too dense.",
    "Rahim is an exciting, unpredictable presence, and Arestrup’s César has a stature that’s nearly Shakespearean.",
    "Sold to the global arthouse market as the \"French Scorsese,\" Audiard does know his genre. A Prophet, the director has said, is the \"anti-Scarface.\"",
    "A compelling piece of naturalistic filmmaking, claustrophobic and thought-provoking."

An Arabian man who is sentenced to six years in prison soon is confronted by a Corsican gang who gives him several tasks to do, soon becoming a ruthless gang member, and he can't even read or write.There is this sense of immense greatness toward Malik who is only 19 years old and seems like the only nice guy who won't shoot an inmate. And the Corsican gang seems to be his only refuge, even if he doesn't like it. The plot is simply told, not through verbal communication, but in several instances where the filmakers step you outside the movie and try to tell you, \"This is Malik now.\" He soon becomes productive, and ruthless. He slowly rebuilds his life. A perfect crime drama that has things anybody could ask for in one.",

The movie certainly addresses racial, cultural, and religious tension as our main protagonist hops back and forth between the world of the Corsicans and that of the Muslims (He himself is of mixed decent and in a lot of ways is not fully accepted by either side).  The movie is long and when you think about its rather slow, but while watching it, it really doesn't feel that way.

Malik is illiterate and has no support outside of prison so his life in jail is all he has.\rIt seems as though Malik has a struggle of character once every five minutes of the film. If he's now doubting his decisions, he's getting his ass kicked by a Corsican. Director Jacques Audiard has done a fine job of creating this complicated yet fragile character that even if you can't understand him, you side with him. The film also demonstrates how a prison might make you do things that you'd never imagined. Filled with violence and gory details, finely crafted, and beautifully cinematographed, A Prophet is one of the best that the French film industry has to offer. (not to mention impressive performances out of the cast)",

A graphic portrayal of the rise of a small-time criminal into a big-time Mafia boss all while serving a six year sentence in prison. \"A Prophet\" has already established itself as crime drama classic and it's only a few years old now. Director Jacques Audiard is something of a master of the genre in France, a French Scorsese one might say. In fact, this film shares a lot of similarities with the best crime drama of all time, \"Goodfellas\". Besides the similar narrative, the two films share one big thing in common: Both films tackle so much and fit a lot into their 150 minute plus runtimes, yet it doesn't feel rushed or sloppy. Executed with ease, this film bowls over a lot of plot points in such little time, but in the end you want to see more. It's a saga that really satisfies and what kept me interested was the charismatic performance of newcomer Tahar Rahim as the film's main character, Malik El Djebena. If you like \"Goodfellas\" or, even if you don't, \"A Prophet\" is a must see. One of the most popular films of 2009, it won the Grand Prix at Cannes and was nominated for the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. Jacques Audiard's \"A Prophet\" is a timeless crime epic that is virtually flawless and remains refreshingly original, which is hard to in such a predictable genre.",

It’s a hard-won journey and a metamorphosis of dubious merit that creates a tone that is both inspirational and terrifying. \"A Prophet\" follows the life of Malik (Tahar Rahim), a young Frenchman of Arab descent, who enters prison as an outsider and is shaped into an adult criminal from the inside. He is a blank slate who has been disposed of by proper society, yet able to rise within the prison hierarchy due to his innate intelligence and sheer will to survive. The prison is under the control of, in essence, by a Corsican gang of inmates headed by César Luciani (Niels Arestrup), whose word is law. César sees everything but expresses little.\r Shortly after his arrival, Malik is ordered by César to murder of another prisoner, an action that grants him protection. The murder sequence is absolutely gripping from his preparation for the act, to how Malik finally pulls it off. His reaction to this brutal initiation is stunningly depicted as it forever haunts Malik. In the years the to come, Malik transforms before our very eyes. Malik's rise to power is chronicled in a logical and believable manner. His ascension through the ranks comes primarily from careful observation and taking advantage of opportunities as they arise. He also manipulates; when he learns that César thinks all Arabs are stupid, he uses the revelation to his advantage.\r Director Jacques Audiard effortlessly constructs a foreboding landscape with complicated rules, and developing characters that are compelling and empathetic, even as they commit heinous acts. Rahim perfectly telegraphs his maturation from petty thief to major player in a brilliant performance that relies much less on words, than the confidence he exudes in his actions. He doesn't need to tell us that he is taking charge of the prison, or surpassing Cesar, we just watch it happen. The film's brutal, realistic violence is not for the faint for heart, but fans of raw, gripping cinema shouldn't be put off; \"A Prophet\" demands to be seen.\r “A Prophet” was a 2010 Academy Award Nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, and winner of the 2010 London Film Critics Award for Best Picture of the Year. The film won a total of nine César Awards in 2010 (the French equivalent of the Oscar), including best actor (Rahim), best director, and best picture.",

However, it's Tahar Rahim that steals the show. As a young, ignorant  Malik he enters prison not knowing what to expect. He is forced to kill and serve Ceasar, the later treating like his lapdog.  Malik, however,  is patient and observant, and uses this to his advantage. While Ceasar constantly reminds Malik that he is dependent on him, Malik eventually realises that it's the other way around. His transformation throughout the film is gradual and extremely convincing. Both actors go through a range of emotions with subtlety yet great performing power. I also enjoyed the claustrophobic directorial route, which suited this prison drama so well. I do not know whether or not this film was suppose to be a reflection today's society, or bringing any of the other \"heavy\" messages I see floating around the web regarding the film. What I got from it was that an individual can become someone he never expected when forced into extremely difficult situations.",

Probably, idk, 40 years ago things could have been like that: getting away with manslaughter like it's nothing, gangs running the prison, ... but nowadays that is not possible anymore (at least not on those extent).\rThis is mostly why \"The Godfather\" was a good movie and this is definitely not.\r Since the premises are, again, entirely unrealistic for the movie's time-setting, I wasn't able to enjoy the movie itself because it was just nonsense after nonsense, piling one another.\r Finally, the movie carries a bad message, won't spoil the ending, but well, that's a bad message on whichever angle you want to see it.",

An impressive and unique drama from \"Jacques Audiard\", a respected contemporary French director who has gained a high position for himself with this film. The movie \"A Prophet\" is a lasting movie with no expiration date. The sequence of killing \"Rib\" is a masterpiece and unmatched. \"Tahar Rahim's\" performance in the role of \"Malik Al Jabna\" is unique and deserved to receive the best actor Caesar, but the other masterpiece of the film belongs to \"Niels Arstrup\" in the role of \"Cesar Luciani\". A subtle and powerful game that cannot be found in the current cinema. It shows such power, strength and decline that you will be amazed. This film tells the story of the impact of the environment and society on the occurrence of violence and the rise to power of a cowardly youth. French contemporary cinema is respected and praised, and the south of France plays an effective role in French contemporary cinema. The island of Corsica is in the south of France, and the film's reference to \"Corsicans\" refers to the Italians living on that island.",
