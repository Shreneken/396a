    "summary": "Two years after the first Sex and the City film, Carrie, Samantha,  Charlotte and Miranda are still friends struggling through the ups and downs of love, life and shopping from fabulous locales.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Sex and the City 2 will never be compared to \"The Godfather, Part II.\" But it's everything a fan could want in a sequel.",
        "So even if Sex and the City 2 consisted of nothing but a two-hour fashion show, it would draw crowds. But it also has the returning cast members in fine comic form, and it has more cutting-edge humor than the first movie.",
        "You don't have to be a fan of Sex and the City to appreciate the kitsch humor here. Part TV-series sequel, part Hollywood sendup, SATC 2 is all satire. It's hard to miss that this film is making gentle fun of itself, of the franchise's materialism, even of its own cinematic allusions.",
        "Although they've left the city behind, the girls haven't forgotten the sex. They're still as frank as ever, as outrageous as ever, as liberated as ever.",
        "Sex and the City 2 is a champagne cocktail on a runaway train -- fizzy, sparkly, giddy-making, and splashing all over the place.",
        "I enjoyed these characters more when they were rich, rather than obscenely rich, when their self-involvement and life crises had one foot on planet Earth -- and when they weren't all gussied up like Mae West in \"Sextette.\"",
        "Frothy as it is, SATC2 is best when it's about the women, not the wardrobe.",
        "A long sit in the shallows, the equivalent of five half-hour episodes strung together.",
        "The Muslim women in \u201cSATC2\u201d are props in the froth. Come to think of it, so are Carrie, Charlotte, Samantha, and Miranda.",
        "Part of the action occurs in the desert, which inadvertently proves apt, since the oases of enjoyable moments -- and they do exist -- suffer from being spaced too widely in what's otherwise a long, arid trek.",
        "If \u201cthe gals\u201d have to bow out, at least they try to do it in a sprint -- in their Manolo Blahniks.  It\u2019s a pity nobody told them you can\u2019t run in heels -- in sand dunes.",
        "The \"Fab Four's\" dramadies continue for the audiences who love them. Trouble is the surrounding story and its supposedly fun sojourns are as embarrassing as granny panties.",
        "Yes, this is a great time for escapism at the movies. But there's a point at which escapism throws what we're trying to forget back in our faces.",
        "As Carrie might type on her laptop while giving one of her girly little shrugs, When did Sex and the City become so long and mean so little?",
        "The satire is sagging, the irony's atrophied and the funny is flabby.",
        "A movie gaudy enough to make Dancing with the Stars seem dignified.",
        "This feels bigger and more cinematic than the first film, and sees a progression in the lives of the characters. But many of the jokes are beyond broad, and the Middle Eastern stereotypes are shockingly cack-handed.",
        "Sex and the City 2 isn't a feature film as much as it is consumer porn. The audience is not asked to relate to the characters, or at least what we remember of them, as much as to their shoes, their bags, their apartments, their couture, their stuff.",
        "It's over the top, and over the rainbow. But just like Carrie's worries about the \"sparkle\" leaving her marriage, this movie is like once-brilliant Champagne, carelessly left out overnight. And gone flat.",
        "One wrongheaded jaw-dropper follows another.",
        "A dunderheaded comic melodrama with clothes to die for and dialogue to shrink from. It\u2019s downright depressing.",
        "An insult to the memory of the cleverly written show and its celebration of friendship, it's a slap in the face for the four gal pals (often photographed at unflattering angles) and an affront to Muslims.",
        "The problem lies with the unimaginative story premise and the quip/reverse quip dialogue that just may be better-suited to half-hour television shows than this nearly 2\u00bd-hour movie feature.",
        "The most depressing thing about Sex and the City 2 is that it seems to justify every nasty thing said and written about the series and first feature film.",
        "Like its predecessor, SATC2--with a script that's basically a sack full of not very funny gag-lines wrapped in strung-together episodic mini-scenes--is not suited to be a movie.",
        "Some of these people make my skin crawl. The characters of Sex and the City 2 are flyweight bubbleheads living in a world which rarely requires three sentences in a row.",
        "The transformation of the girls from winsome wisecrackers into whiny bling-obsessed chuckleheads is complete.",
        "The biggest sin of Sex and the City 2 is its lack of beauty. It's garish when it should be sumptuous, tacky when it should be luxe, wafer-thin when it should be whip-smart and sophisticated.",
        "Hits a new low of idiocy and crassness.",
        "Sex And The City 2 panders to that audience to the point of self-destruction, squandering whatever goodwill the franchise had left after the first so-so movie by plopping its beloved characters into a series of garish vignettes that throw their shallowness into sharp relief.",
        "It's astounding how a movie this long could accomplish so little.",
        "Twenty minutes in, the movie is already operating at a deficit, and it never recovers.",
        "But the best, most irrefutable reason why Sex and the City 2 deserves one-half a shining star. It\u2019s worse than Sex and the City 1, and that alone is a remarkable achievement.",
        "Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s Carrie should be a cautionary tale of perpetual adolescence; her character should be out dating any number of Hollywood\u2019s graying beer bellied frat boys. But no. Instead, we are asked to identify and sympathize with a person who gets everything she wants, but complains anyway.",
        "The ugly smell of unexamined privilege hangs over this film like the smoke from cheap incense.",
        "Thanks to writer-director Michael Patrick King, I now have a fair idea how it might feel to be stoned to death with scented candles.",
        "Indeed, this movie's offensive on many levels, but Arabs and Muslims don't get to feel special. It relies on stupid stereotypes because it's a stupid movie that's offensive to virtually everyone.",
        "Real feelings lurk just below the surface--Samantha's terror of growing old, Carrie's fear of eventual tedium in a childless marriage. Yet the surface is where the movie stays, like an old submarine with dead batteries.",
        "And it's true that this movie's absolute tone-deafness, its complete disconnection from our current economic and geopolitical reality, by moments achieves a perverse Warholian profundity."

It's a book club comprised of materialistic Islamic fashionistas who end up validating the ill-mannered behavior displayed by these privileged New York socialites, when the middle east-end girls step out of their traditional \"hijab\" attire to reveal the \"haute couture\" fashions beneath like naughty Catholic schoolgirls. Now Carrie(Sarah Jessica Parker) and her gal pals become the role models that they proclaim themselves to be. At a karaoke club, the ugly Americans have the effontery to sing Helen Reddy's feminist anthem \"I Am Woman\", both for themselves as a pointed animadversion of this hyper-patriarchal society, and the local women whom the westerners presume are in need of some consciousness-raising and enlightenment, without understanding that the mobilization of feminist-minded Muslim women may have deadly reprecussions from their oppressors. Samantha(Kim Cattrall), the ugliest American of them all, not only offends the Abu Dhabi men, but the women, as well. In a very public arena, Samantha's demonstrative canoodling with her latest conquest, proves to be an affront to the female bystanders' inherent modesty, which is derived from a sheltered upbringing that deemed such forwardness as justification for an \"honor killing\". To some Muslim females, the headscarf and veil are personal choices. In Diane Crespo and Stefan Schaefer's \"Arranged\", the principal of a Brooklyn middle school denigrates a young Muslim schoolteacher's traditional apparel choices, and offers her shopping money for designer clothes. It never occurs to the culturally biased educator, or \"Sex and the City 2\", that some Muslim women, like American girls who exploit themselves sexually on their own terms, adopt the \"hijab\" without the stigmatizing effect of Koran-sanctioned female subjugation, in which both forms of self-debasement are post-feminist, but nevertheless, subversive acts of emancipation.",

So you want to like it, you want to make it your summer time special. You want to enjoy it, but it just blows in your face over and over and over again. It's just too much. It's over-done, over-the-top, just like the wedding at the very beginning of the movie. It's over-produced and over-thought. It lacks carelessness and ease, not to mention it crosses over to ridiculousness one too many times. It doesn't have the wit and the smarts the original series had, and you can't find anything in common with Carrie - once always broke because of her shoe addiction, now living in luxury. Before, she couldn't afford to have her apartment renovated, now she's owning two and flying out to Middle East without a blink of an eye. I'm giving it 10, because when you peel all that off - the bad script, the over-produced schemes and the horrible product-placement - you kind of get what the producers wanted to do.

The creators wanted to make something over the top silly and fun, and the movie succeeded.  Yes, it has some eye rolling moments, but this movie is pure escapism similar to old movies from the 30's, 40's, and 50's.  I laughed a lot at this film, and the scene where Charlotte and Miranda talk about parenthood in the bar is one of the best dramatic and funny moments in cinema this year.  Also, I don't think these critics were true fans of the original HBO show.  That series definitely had some silly moments as well.  I don't think the movies have been that different from the TV show.  I hope they make more sequels!  There!  I said it and feel EXHILARATED!",

The dvd cover for this movie has actually photo-shopped Kim Cattrall so much I actually thought she'd been replaced by another actress. Were they blind? Now Carrie is meant to be a fashion icon and the first pair of shoes we see are garish brash sequined FAIL heels. Then she's wearing a hideous tiara with crimped hair - again someone was blind. Liza Minelli covering Beyonce Single Ladies was just absolutely woeful and sad. Sam's first sex scene lives up to the hilarity we expect and is the first good scene. The soundtrack for when they arrive in Abu Dhabi was the Stargate Movie soundtrack which was a tad wierd as I kept expecting the SG1 team any minute now. I didn't see this as insulting to Muslims as others have commented. It was four wealthy American women experiencing complete opulence in Abu Dhabi so it seemed ok to me that they didn't know much about the place, the people, the culture...  They didn't actresses justice in this movie, using camera angles, lighting and make-up that made them look old and tired. Miranda and Charlotte really took a backseat in this movie which was a shame.

It was based in a form of reality that many women experience on a daily basis and put it on the small screen for the masses to see.

As such, I recommend checking it out, but there is no truth to the portrayal of Arabs, and there is no mention of the women who find the Arab (conservative) culture to be empowering. Instead, the movie depicts the non-excessive people as submitting to the excessive rich women. That is a false and borderline deluded message. There also wasn't any focus on solving anything. The only woman who comes across as analytically smart is the red-haired one, who also uses her professional knowledge to help her friends. There are also few showings of moral integrity.

All parties involved should be ashamed. And I say this as a die hard fan of the show...SATC2 is deeply offensive on MULTIPLE levels (e.g. women, Muslims, Arabs, discerning viewers) and casts a dark shadow over the series' legacy. It's contrived, horribly oblivious to privilege, and nearly unparalleled in the depth of its ethnocentricity.",

I have been in a long distance marriage because of the nature of my job, my husband cheated on me times without number but since I wasn\u2019t around to get him caught red handed in the act I decided to hack his cell phone to get all the data activities on his device. I got in contact with knoxtech00 (@) gmailcom through the head of the IT department in my workplace. According to him, after a long search on here he got to discover this genius and swift IT personnel, this guy is the best in the game right now. He shared me his contact info, After I got in contact with him, we made a deal and i paid him. I doubted the services at first but what I felt impossible became possible within 6hours,I got access to my husband\u2019s phone activities,I don\u2019t know how he did it but it looked like magic cause it was as if I had his phone in my palm. I got access to his Snapchat messages and videos, WhatsApp,instagram,Facebook,call logs ,video chat , text messages etc all in one swipe. I\u2019m happy I got to discover the truth, knowing is better than self doubt. He is definitely the real deal, do not hesitate to reach out to him at knoxtech00 (@)gmailcom for a perfect, quality and satisfactory spying and investigatory services.",
