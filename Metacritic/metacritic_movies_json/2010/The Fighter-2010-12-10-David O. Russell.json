  "summary": "A talented boxer with a troubled path focuses his energy on training his brother to become a champ.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "An exhilarating fight-flick that, like its scrappy central character, is impossible not to root for.",
    "Virtually flawless performances and directorial execution render The Fighter one of the most thrilling movies of 2010.",
    "That rare film in which every performer in it leaves the viewer in awe.",
    "A movie so rousing, so real and so full of complicated emotions that it all feels brand-new.",
    "It's a film possessed of its own force, wit and style, and it builds to a rousing climax that absolutely pays off in crowd-pleasing fashion.  It knows what it is, doesn't try to be what it's not, and hits you with drop-dead force.  In short, it's terrific.",
    "This one, as thoughtful as it is rousing, scores a TKO.",
    "Urgent, gritty, sometimes weirdly funny, The Fighter might be considered his first feel-good movie. But Russell's too honest and acute an observer to serve up affirmation without leaving a subversive aftertaste of ambivalence and unease.",
    "David O. Russell's film makes use of some terrific performances - Christian Bale is brilliant, as is Melissa Leo, even by their lofty standards.",
    "Russell has always excelled at finding new ways to use familiar actors, and every performance in The Fighter is noteworthy if not outstanding.",
    "While the film handles itself well in the ring, it's brilliant in the arena of a blue-collar family that brutalizes its younger son and best hope for worldly success in the name of sustaining him.",
    "The rousing The Fighter tries a number of risky maneuvers and manages to make them pay off in the end. The movie initially feels like more of a near thing than the filmmakers anticipated, but as in boxing it's only the final decision that counts.",
    "With solid bodywork, clever feints and tremendous heart, it scores at least a TKO, by which I mean both that it falls just short of overpowering greatness - I can't quite exclaim, \"It's a knockout!\" - and that the most impressive thing about it is technique.",
    "Director David O. Russell (\"Three Kings\") delivers a film of staggering impact.",
    "If you think \"Rocky\" and \"Raging Bull\" define the alpha and omega of boxing movies, think again. David O. Russell's The Fighter proves there's still punch in the genre, especially when a filmmaker tells a familiar story in a brand-new way.",
    "The Fighter is funny, ferocious, sad, sweet, pulpy, and violent. Sometimes, all in the same minute.",
    "An off-center but exceptional boxing film I prefer in every aspect, especially one: It feels like it comes from real life as well as the movies.",
    "The Fighter, its heart full to bursting, is an emotional powerhouse that comes close to spilling over.",
    "Visionary director David O. Russell so deftly weaves the family's story that we, too, are initially seduced by Dicky.",
    "The Fighter is this close to a triumph: a movie that steeps us in the grit of its time and place - Lowell, Mass., in the 1990s - and electrifyingly dramatizes Ward's battles with the family that almost loved him to death.",
    "Bale's live-wire performance typifies the many major and minor elements that elevate The Fighter from the deeply conventional sports movie it might have been into the endearingly offbeat sports movie it turns out to be.",
    "The movie has so much texture that once it gets you, you're good and got.",
    "At its best, The Fighter takes on the chasm between televised boxing and its mostly working-class, aspirational origins with grit and intelligence.",
    "By far the most rousing, expertly cast movie this year, David O. Russell's movie takes a roundabout way of telling its true story.",
    "The picture makes too many concessions to the Hollywood judges, pulls too many punches. But at least it has real punches to pull, because there's honest sweat here too, and a full complement of those archetypes that lie at the popular heart of the genre.",
    "A punch-drunk tale whose fitful ramble from Jerry Springer-style family seaminess to \"Rocky\"-like triumph is elevated enormously by knockout performances.",
    "Ultimately, The Fighter loses its courage and betrays the terms of its own story by fashioning an interpretation designed to please the people it portrays. It does a switch on us, by changing its focus from Micky's character to Micky's career and then pretending it was really about the career all along.",
    "A boxing movie swinging in too many directions at once, as if someone sneaked a third clubber into the ring. All the emotional punches land solidly, to occasionally devastating effect, but at the conclusion you're not sure which competing cliche wins.",
    "Cast against type is Amy Adams. Normally tabbed for sweet and innocent roles, Adams here dons the persona of a confrontational bitch.",
    "These are characters so repulsive that it's hard to care what happens to them, but it's to the credit of a superb cast that you do end up caring.",
    "Bale dominates the movie as Dicky Eklund, a pathetic loudmouth who's let his own fight career slip away from him, yet what really holds this together is Wahlberg's low-key, firmly internalized performance as a man torn between his loyalty to the clan and his responsibility to himself.",
    "The screenplay, credited to three writers, has that over-doctored feeling to it, and we're asked to take on a larger redemption tale that undermines the truth of Bale's wholly unsympathetic portrayal of a drug addict and a narcissist. The Fighter's desire to show us what that awful combination looks like is overwhelmed by its urge to show us a Hollywood-style triumph.",
    "In its small moments, say when Walhberg sighs that his robe misspells \"Micky,\" The Fighter feels clued-in to the very small, very tough world of a man trying to make his way out of his block-and after getting to know his family, you want to help him pack his bags.",
    "If The Fighter feels like kind of a mess, lurching from one scene to the next as if the film itself has taken a few hits to the head, that's not entirely a bad thing.",
    "Only Amy Adams, playing Mickey's tough-tender girlfriend CharÂ­lene, manages to be convincingly working-class without seeming either dopey or rabid or strung-out.",
    "The weakness of the film is the weakness of the leading role. That's not a criticism of Mark Wahlberg, who has a quite capable range, but of how he and Russell see the character.",
    "You can't necessarily blame Wahlberg, as his modest performance is the one element that feels truly authentic and heartfelt.",
    "The Fighter, for all the dedication of its players, takes a heavy swing at us, and misses.",
    "The tragedy of The Fighter is that Wahlberg's performance suggests a character who wants more. And yet Russell barely seems to notice how much subtlety Wahlberg brings to his role, or to the movie at large.",
    "Pity the boxing movie that thinks it can be both \"Raging Bull\" and \"Rocky.\"",
    "It plays as a \"Rocky\"-fied fairy tale for our time: Consigned to Palookaville, a sweet, unassuming boxer with more heart than brains steps up-all the way to the top of the world.",
    "So like much of this film, the viewer is turned into an observer. You never feel close enough to the action, either in the ring or in the kitchens, living rooms and tough streets where the story takes place. The characters engage you up to a point but never really pull you in."

Never loud for some punches, fainter for others -- just punch-sound, punch-sound, punch-sound: Get real, sound editors. Of course, it's nothing new that fighting sounds have always been exaggerated in Hollywood (with the possible exception of Jeff Bridges' punch in Peter Bogdanovich's \"Last Picture Show\"), and there is indeed much integrity in the history of boxing, but why is knocking someone out still a sport? Isn't boxing just romanticized human rooster-fighting? For the same reason we hire babes in bikinis to hold up \"Round 1\" signs, we (more often than not, males) are apparently just animals out for sex, blood, and Budweiser (and if we are not, that makes no difference for what Hollywood sells). That said, I thought Wahlberg (strangely, no nomination) and Mellisa Leo (nominated for best supporting actress [and later winning that award with an historical (expletive!) acceptance speech]), were both excellent, and the mother's 7 white-trash daughters were both intentionally amusing and scary. Is it worth seeing? Sure -- it's a true story, and Wahlberg and Bale (who also later won an oscar) offer genuine portrayals. Lastly, you had to love the clip tagged on the end with the real brothers from Lowell, Mass. They did not need to tell you who was who--it was a charming tag after an unsettling story.",

Memorable and convincing roles from Adams and Bale make this one of the best movies of the year. Wahlberg takes us somewhere special in the ring, but loses his rhythm amidst the side plots and out-of-ring action.

This two support characters are the foundation of the film, because they both are trying to project a life to a utopic future, but Dicky and his mom are too blind to see the reality, because they live in the past, where Dick had dignity and Alice had common sense.These two characters are awesomely played by Christian Bale and Melissa Leo, those dazzling performances and the no expected one of Amy Adams, cover the wasted one of Mark Whalberg.",

Naturally,  people will compare this to Rocky base from the trailer alone and boxing element, but if you watch the Fighter entirely, you will see that its a totally different. Rocky and The Fighter deserve to be known as their own. Another thing to keep in mind is the Rocky was art imitating life (inspired from a true event), while The Fighter was life imitating art (a true story).\r I deducted one point from this movie because I thought they could have rephrased the info in the aftermath of film.

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nExactly how uneducated and emotionally stunted are the fighter's seven sisters, the hairspray-addled girls who give Charlene(Amy Adams), a barmaid, such a hard time? Very uneducated. Very, very stunted. That's how much. Concerning adulthood, the \"girls\" put to mind that old adage, \"they know the words, but not the music\". Set in 1993, the Ecklund sisters, some of them clearly pushing forty(Asian women age better), are like eternal teenagers, catty and fiercely cliquish, under the watchful eye of a domineering mother, so eighties, it hurts just looking at them. That Alice(Melissa Leo), she's a real piece of work. Her kids are all messed up. The movie's use of Whitesnake's \"Here I Go Again\" suggests that Nirvana never made it to Lowell, Massachusetts. While it's the brothers who know how to take and deliver a punch, the sisters seem to be the ones who ended up punch-drunk. To them, a college...dropout, not a graduate, mind you, is cause for class warfare. Any man alive, let alone a woman, has to be brave to enter the Ecklund household; enter the fighter's girlfriend, a former URI high-jumper, categorically dismissed as that \"MTV girl\", a woman deemed by the \"white trash\" Greek chorus to be something akin to a fleshy hood ornament on David Coverdale's car, weathers the name-calling and wouldn't be faulted if she chose to fight fire with fire, by pointing out the elephant in the room that Dickie(Christian Bale) brings into the open during the film's most telling scene. Tired of living in his brother's shadow, Micky finally summons up enough intestinal fortitude to set his vampiric family straight, when the aging pugilist announces his plans to tarin year-round in Las Vegas, while Charlene sits not-so-quietly on the couch, lending moral support throughout this long-overdue ostracization process. The wisdom of the move, of course, is challenged. First, by Alice, who resorts to emotional blackmail so transparent, a panel of judges, if there was one present, would have awarded the fight to Micky, by unanimous decision, and then by a brother whose rhetoric functions like punches that never land. Swing and miss, swing and miss goes Dicky(whose claim to fame was a moral victory over middleweight boxing legend Sugar Ray Leonard...almost fourteen years ago), and his mouth, spouting out the pros of staying home to train, just like he did in his prime, without a trace of self-awareness about the ramifications that this tragic decision entailed. Because Dicky remained staunchly local, and surrounded himself with the dope fiends of this working class borough(he's known as \"The Pride of Lowell\"), he helped contribute to his own demise, succumbing like he did, to the crackheads and the prevailing milieu of social and economical decay. He had help, of course, but nobody has the heart, not even Charlene who claims to hate him, least of all, the fighter's father(henpecked to death by Alice) and the fighter himself, to lay bare the facts about this almost famous fighter's life since his brief taste of fleeting fame. \"The Fighter\" doesn't spell it out for moviegoers, but everybody can plainly see how the matriarch's sick promotion of familial tribalism(it's sick because Alice is willing to repeat the same mistakes with Micky) led to he favorite son's downward spiral, not to mention, the smaller roundabout southbound spirals of her cartoonish sisters. Speaking of cartoons, that's what the multiple incidents at the neighborhood crack house resemble, a Warner Brothers short, in which the mother and first-born son take on the personas of the Road Runner(she's fast, beep-beep, nine kids) and Wile E. Coyote. (Dicky has a friend he calls \"Boo-Boo\", which makes him Yogi Bear, I guess.) Like the feral dog, the crackhead constantly finds himself in the same fatalistic predicament; he's falling down from a high place, a \"cliff\"(an open window), that ends with a thud(instead of the canyon floor's hard surface, he lands on a bed of garbage bags), in which he miraculously walks away from with nary a scratch. The coyote nearly kills the lightning-fast bird. Likewise, it's what Dicky does to his mother each time she surprises him at his drug den, that is, until Alice's compartmentalizing skills takes on a life of its own, by which she compartmentalizes the truth away. So Micky stays east-side, and eventually breaks away from his Looney Tunes family, but it's only temporary, since the whole clan is back in the fold before Ward's title bout with Englishman Shea Neary. As a result, Micky's victory feels somewhat tempered by Dicky's all-consuming hunger for recognition, co-opting his brother's success into his own, by feeding on the championship boxer's afterglow. True to form, during the post-script, some doc footage shows Ward struggling to get a word in edgewise from his showboating older brother, trying to steal the movie, and perhaps, succeeding.",

When I talk about a movie that I've seen, I try to not ruin it for people that have not yet seen it, so that usually means that I can't really say anything about the ending, because just by characterizing the ending, you can say too much, so that's why I'm not going to say anything about the endings, but I will try to tell you whether it's worth your time or not.  The Kids are Alright, was pretty good, so I can see it being on a list of ten films.  Inception, was great, and there were some aspects of it that I loved, but I thought that it ran a tad long, and got confusing in places.  Winter's Bone, I guess that you would have to characterize that as a \"sleeper\" film, because I don't think that it's getting the audience that it deserves.  Before I saw The Fighter, I would say that Winter's Bone was the best film that I saw from 2010, it is gritty, understated, and so very worthwhile, the atmosphere in that movie was so real, so palpable, a fantastic movie to me, certainly on the list, and a contender for number one.  I have my copy of The King's Speech, but I am watching it tonight, haven't seen it yet.  I can be pretty critical of moves, but after watching The Fighter last night, I bow down in awe.  Masterful is not too strong of a description, I can't say enough about how much I loved it, and it's based on a true story, which doesn't happen all that often.  The performances were amazing and riveting.  I am not one to watch movies that I've seen over again, but this one and Winter's Bone, I will, gladly.",

While I will not say director David Russell's The Fighter brings a new aspect to the table, his film extensively brings out the talent of its actors overshadowing the ensemble of other 2010 favorite Inception. The Fighter is a well-directed and captivating piece, and is as true as its performances.The Fighter is a biographical film depicting the life of aspiring professional boxer Mickey Ward, played by the surprisingly multi-dimensional Wahlberg, and his half-brother Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale). Ward is living under the shadow of Dicky, a former boxer who falls into the nightmare of crack addiction and violence. When Dicky faces a full decline, Ward, with the aid of love interest Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams), he learns he must rely on his own decisions to find success. Complimented by Wahlberg's acting, Adams puts on her finest performance since 2008's Doubt. Melissa Leo, who plays Mickey's overbearing mother, also gives a commendable act.The film is not solely based on the sport and Ward's effort to \"rise to the top.\" Instead, The Fighter also diverges into two trails illustrating the drug addiction of character Dicky Eklund, who is magnificently played by Christian Bale. Let me say this, Christian Bale gives an unforgettable tour de force performance.  No matter what opinion you may have on Bale, from his viral outburst to his laughable performances in the Batman series, the actor is unbelievably good. Bale puts underlying passion and grit into his performance that will crawl under the skin causing either a sense of deep pathos or disturbance. The Fighter is a captivating film with an ample spectrum of emotion. While telling a \"rags to riches\" story, it also gives an illustrative view into the lower classes of White America. Although the movie's story is overall somewhat cliche and predictable, the depth put on the ensemble and direction makes it solid entertainment and subtle commentary. It at first is slow to buildup, but The Fighter, led by its magnificent trio, will grab and toss you in multiple directions.",

Dicky (Christian Bale), Micky's half-brother and trainer, is a drug addict that always fail to show up for training. Their relationship is complicated because Micky wanted more than just a crackhead brother who doesn't know what he's doing. Supporting along that line come Alice (Mellisa Leo), the brothers' mother and manager, who also wants Micky to stay with her and Dicky instead of going to someone better. After meeting the love of his life Charlene (Amy Adams), who convinced Micky that his family's no good, he decided to go on and try something else. Success with the new manager and trainer, Micky got the shot of the title match. Mark Walhberg who plays the boxer is to many critics the lowpoint of the film. Everytime the camera focuses on him, it seems like he doesn't have anything to say. Perhaps the writing for Walhberg isn't as concentrated and too vague compare to his co-stars. Walhberg was suppose to carry the film with his role but instead it felt like his co-star Christian Bale did all the heavy lifting. Playing a drug addict who went to jail for resisting arrest and assaulting an officer, Bale (Dicky) was at his best. Emotionally understanding and physically confused by years of sitting on his ass, Dicky's only job was to train his brother into the championship. Bale gave up this amazing vibe that he knows what he's doing but at the same time too confused to do it right. The film, rather than focusing on Mark Walhberg, did a completely different character study on Christian Bale. Carrying along the heavy loads are Mellisa Leo and Amy Adams who played the mother and girlfriend of Walhberg. Leo and Adams had a chemistry in which both hated each other and both share the same goal of helping Dicky. Delivering explicit lines, Amy Adams is the best I've seen her in years. With two Oscar nominations already, she might even earn her third. Though the cast is above average, the writing in some parts were off. It seems like the writers wanted the actors themselves to carry the film without dialogue. They thought they can depend on the actors, but it is impossible for the actors to do any good without a solid script. David O. Russell finely crafted the film, but at times, it looked as if only the fighting scenes count. Focusing too much on the fights instead aiming to offer drama, he made the movie looked like an ESPN fight show. But set aside all of that, David O. Russell's got a talent in him and the fight scenes do look amazing. Perhaps his biggest contribution to the film is his directing of the cast.\r The Fighter has a predictable plot yet it pulls out so much depth offered by the cast that we can say The Fighter is finely entertaining.

The movie shows how, on the one hand a family can be an obstacle. But on the other hand, it is nice to know there is always someone standing behind you. One just has to find the balance between one's personal autonomy and a family commitment. It is interesting that we all try to first rid ourselves from dependence, but then strive to found a family in the first place. \"The Fighter\" has pretty good acting, as well as good filmmaking. Worth watching.",

Similar great supporting roles and sympathetic hero. Christian Bale and Melissa Leo should get nominations for best supporting  roles...Amy Adams might get a nod as well. Only reason I don't give The Fighter a 10 is Mark Wahlberg's good,but not exceptional work as main character. Some critics have not liked the humor that pops up from time to time in the movie. I could not disagree more...this is exactly what makes the whole thing work.Watching  crack-high Bales dive out the window to avoid his family is priceless and sad at the same time. See it",

Once again the acting is near perfect and not just from Wahlberg, but from Bale, Adams, Leo, the WHOLE cast seems to ooze the reality of a Massachusetts neighbourhood. I suppose what's most important is that i feel like I've just read Micky Ward's autobiography and know all the details about his rise to brilliance.

I have to concede that initially I didn't expect to much from this film but it was an absolutely awesome movie. Unlike other boxing films that have failed The Fighter gets the right recipe in mixing together the key ingredients of the boxing, the drama, the emotion and the story in what is an extremely realistic movie its gritty and very lifelike but also provides some genuinely fun moments! The film follows the younger days of \"Irish\" Micky Ward (Walhberg) and his journey to become World Champion, trained by his drug-addicted brother (Christian Bale). However, its a powerful film and there are some sublime performances throughout the film which justifiably saw Christian Bale and Melissa Leo (Alice Ward, the mother) picking up Oscar's for Best Supporting Actor/Actress, Bale was outstanding as Dicky Eklund in what must be one of the performances of his career whilst Leo was at her best in her portrayal as control-freak Alice Ward, just amazing! And not forgetting Wahlberg, who for a change is actually pretty good as Ward and Amy Adams is on fine form as Charlene Fleming. What sets The Fighter apart from other failed bpxing movies is the fact that this is more than a boxing movie! Its got the perfect combination and in doing so provides an engaging, exhilarating and staggering feel-good film. A must have movie!",

Yes, Christian Bale does deserve the universal praise he has garnered as the good-for-nothing older brother, but it is as much Mark Wahlberg's film as it is Bale's (as it should be - he is the protagonist). Wahlberg gives a masterclass in the subtlety of acting, bringing across with ease what it would be like constantly living in your domineering elder brother's shadow. Unfortunately, subtlety doesn't win awards, though Wahlberg and Amy Adams should receive special recognition for sharing the screen and holding their own against the scene-stealing performances of Bale and Melissa Leo. Surprisingly enough for a boxing movie, the fights are probably the least entertaining aspect of the film, competently done though they are - it is the in-depth character development and and crackling family conflict that make The Fighter so truly memorable.",
