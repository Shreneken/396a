    "critic_reviews": [
        "A ridiculously entertaining, perfectly paced, ultra-violent cinematic rush that kicks the places other movies struggle to reach.",
        "It brings together several popular strains of contemporary moviemaking and combines them into one big, shameless, audacious, compulsively watchable, irresistibly likable piece of pure entertainment.",
        "Equal parts audacious dark comedy, wish-fulfillment fantasy and over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek action-adventure.",
        "Kick-Ass moves with such bloody assurance that you'd be forgiven for not seeing how smart it is. But smart it is. Smart, important and deadly.",
        "The best superhero movie since \"The Dark Knight\" (and far less serious in tone or approach), Kick-Ass earns its name in every way.",
        "Maybe I enjoyed the similarly themed Kick-Ass because it took me back to that innocent time. Or maybe it's because this is the most brazenly funny bloodbath unleashed on the public since \"Pulp Fiction.\"",
        "Kick-Ass has punk energy, ace action moves, and a winning sense of absurdist fun.",
        "A brutally funny deconstruction, a hybrid of \u201cWatchmen\u201d and \u201cSuperbad\u201d filtered through John Woo. It\u2019s a boisterously original piece of entertainment . . . that isn\u2019t for everyone. Note the rating, which should be triple-R, as in Really, Remarkably R.",
        "An enjoyably supercharged and ultraviolent teen-rebel comic-book fantasy that might be described -- in spirit, at least -- as reality-based.",
        "Director Matthew Vaughn has provided an imperfect but still wickedly hilarious take on Mark Millar's deconstruction of superhero mythos.",
        "A clever movie premise based on an obscure comic book has been turned into, okay we\u2019ll say it, a fanboy\u2019s kick-ass wet dream of a movie that could be a surprise Spring smash.",
        "Its balancing act between innocence and gore perfectly matches the expectations of genre fans, who should embrace the movie.",
        "For those of us who find somber superhero movies faintly ridiculous, Kick-Ass is a one-film justice league.",
        "It's also perfectly content to be an insanely violent, funny take on an established genre. And in that respect, Kick-Ass lives up to its name.",
        "This shrewd mixture of slick comic-book mayhem, unmistakable sweetness and ear-splitting profanity is poised to be a popular culture phenomenon because of its exact sense of the fantasies of the young male fanboy population.",
        "With Kick-Ass, there are more cheap thrills, gory explosions and superheroes than a movie geek's YouTube mash-up.",
        "Kick-Ass is a rabid puppy of a movie, energetically bounding off the screen and into your lap, where it proceeds to chew off your face.",
        "Kick-Ass reminds you of the great pleasures and thrills of superhero comics -- then turns everything you ever learned from comic books upside down.",
        "Irresponsible, morally murky, and batshit insane--in other words, Kick-Ass might be the most fun two hours you\u2019ll spend in a movie theater. It delivers the darkly comic laughs (the movie is clearly not taking itself too seriously, so you should do likewise) as well as the jaw-dropping action, but Kick-Ass\u2019s real accomplishment is bringing back the winkingly crazy Nic Cage we used to know and love.",
        "Kick-Ass should delight fans of the original comics and garden-variety action junkies as well. Suggested subtitle: \"Iron Man, You Just Got Served.\"",
        "It's irreverently entertaining.",
        "The movie belongs to Moretz, whose sensational performance will be talked about for years. Her scenes with Cage, who wears a Batsuit and uses a voice borrowed from Adam West, are a hoot.",
        "Kick-Ass is some kind of twisted fun.",
        "Kick-Ass is a compendium of all sleazy things, and it sings like a siren to our inner Tarantinos.",
        "A particularly timely story about civic-mindedness and the pursuit of fame. Along with a lot of potty-mouthed ass-kicking action.",
        "Ms. Moretz is by far the best thing about the film: she holds the screen as gracefully as she executes a running back flip.",
        "Fusing teen comedy, bad-boy raunch, Tarantino-style gonzo mayhem, and tossing in a bloodthirsty little girl vigilante who swears like Steve Buscemi in a Coen brothers movie, the film has its moments of high-flying, low-down style. It\u2019s also nowhere near as subversive as it thinks it is.",
        "Grungily stylish and often funny, at least for a while, though all of the caveats and contradictions that apply to Tarantino films apply here: One man's--or boy's--stylization is another's profane, unrelenting and tedious brutality.",
        "Vaughn opts for comic-book bigness\u2014big fights, big laugh lines, big explosions\u2014but without a Spider-Man or Batman at the front of the action, Kick-Ass\u2019s heroes and villains look smaller-than-life in a larger-than-life world.",
        "Never as shocking as it thinks it is, as funny as it should be, or as engaged in cultural critique as it could be, Kick-Ass is half-assed.",
        "An awkward blend of ultra-realistic violence, boundaries-bending satire and low comedy.",
        "Vaughn did a cracking good caper film with a pre-007 Daniel Craig called \"Layer Cake\" six years ago, but Kick-Ass has little of that film's heady panache and instead batters you about the face and neck with wildly over-the-top fountains of gore, bone-cracking slow-motion, and, yes, Cage, who dials his acting down a few notches from the kicky Herzogian mindf---ery of \"Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans.\"",
        "Since Kick-Ass' whole premise is that comic-book violence, when enacted in real life, has real consequences, it seems a strange choice to layer Tarantino-style splatter onto the Y.A.-novel setting and play the whole thing for laughs.",
        "The standard defense of such material is that we are watching \u201ccartoon violence,\u201d but, when filmmakers nudge a child into viewing savagery as slapstick, are we not allowing them to do what we condemn in the pornographer--that is, to coarsen and inflame?",
        "It may well be a hit, but me, I'm waiting for  \"Iron Man 2.\"",
        "Critics who come out against Kick-Ass are leaving themselves open to that worst of contemporary accusations: a failure to be cool. But pretending that Kick-Ass is just another good-time comic book blowout is the greater failure.",
        "Will I seem hopelessly square if I find Kick-Ass morally reprehensible and will I appear to have missed the point? Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a big fan of the original comic book, and you think the move does it justice. You know what? You inhabit a world I am so very not interested in.",
        "Kick-Ass - based on a graphic novel - thinks it's so brave and bold. But it's more like the title character, a dweeb who just thinks he's tough."

It's not mercilessly bleak like Watchmen, not depraved like Super and it's certainly not for kids like Sky High. A lot of the film's quality hinges on a truly great cast. Aaron Johnson makes a great loveable loser Dave Lizewski who decides to become the titular, wet-suited hero, Mark Strong adds another great despicable villain, the powerful gangster Frank D'Amico to his repertoire and Christopher Mintz-Plasse is great as always playing Frank's lonely son and (disturbingly willing) heir to the D'Amico criminal empire, who masquerades as a new hero Red Mist to contact Kick-Ass under the pretence of friendship. The real highlights of the film are the dream pairing of a moustachioed Nicholas Cage doing his best Adam West impression and a hilariously filthy-mouthed Chloe Grace Moretz playing the vengeful father/daughter hero team of Big Daddy and Hit Girl. Let's be honest, Mr Cage has had some stinkers in his career, but when he gets it right, he really gets it right - he has the opportunity to show his undeniable talent for both comedy and pathos here, and the character arc of Damon and Mindy Macready is certainly the most rewarding and entertaining of the whole film. There are a few instances where the story runs out of steam, and Matthew Vaughn's Brit-dominated cast of villains do occasionally slip out of their American tough-guy accents, but a wealth of affectionate digs at comic book lore, Jane Goldman's delightfully sweary script, some gloriously violent action and Matthew Vaughn's accomplished direction more than make up for it. Kick-Ass is an immensely enjoyable viewing experience, that will please comic fans, comedy fans and fans of terrifying murderous tweens alike. I just hope the inevitable sequel doesn't lose any of its charm, inventiveness and especially its sense of fun.",

I admit that several things in the film made me raise an eyebrow, and it did make me think, because I've never seen stuff like an 11-year old girl swearing like a truck driver and killing people in brutally violent ways in a film. Ultimately I think the ones crying \"for shame!\" are over-reacting  just a tad. The film does puts its toes to the line, but for me it doesn't quite cross it. And let's face it, it's a funny, clever idea, extremely well executed. It doesn't make the mistake of many such films by diving into the action immediately before we've gotten to know the characters. People are oblivious to the fact that it makes it more exciting if we care about what happens to them, if it's not just frenetic mindless action. Vaughn takes his time and his pacing is impeccable, just the right amount of build-up to the climactic scenes, and he deftly makes these scenes emotional as well as exciting. The cast is pretty much great, with the possible exception of Mark Strong, who is not quite loathesome enough to be the arch-villain. Every critic and every \"user\", however, has agreed on one thing: this film contains a star in the making. Chloe Grace Moretz is astoundingly assured and inspired at 11 years old. Never seen a child actor this compelling EVER, not Anna Paquin, not Natalie Portman, not Jodie Foster. She steals every scene she's in and steals the movie. See it just for her.  Also, great music.",

Kick-Ass' world is riotous, self-deprecating, and awesome; but it is the exact opposite of irresponsible.  Rather, it unmasks an adult world in which police officers operate on both sides of crime, citizens are voyeurs into one another's suffering, and we all wonder who is going to change it.  By now, it is clear that neither adults nor teenagers are willing to risk their routines for their neighbors.  At least teenagers still fantasize about doing something.  So the obvious answer is a little girl who, with some sidekick mockery from Nic Cage, makes Batman look like a man dressed up like a bat.  To echo other reviewers, Hitgirl is the new standard of awesome.  But, until Kick-Ass' moment of transformation, she is also the last human willing to offer an embodied answer to injustice.  That Vaughn hides this seriousness in such absolutely brilliant awesomeness might confuse some, but it should not be misinterpreted as a statement of \"coolness\" or teenage hormonal self-gratification.  It's saying much more than that.  Why hold the fact that it's also cool against it?",

It's brilliant - funny, violent and just so damn cool. Matthew Vaughn took a risk making this film and I can guarantee it's paid off. The film is packed full of comic book references and homages to film like Batman, Kill Bill and Scarface. The title character is played Aaron Johnson, who justifies his place on the screen. I thought his American accent (he's British) was very natural and he brings this 'loser' character to life. But don't think he's the star, it's actually his smaller companion played by Chloe Grace Moretz - the merciless and skilled fighter Hit Girl. She was effective, outstanding and gives one of the best performances by a child actor that I've seen in a while. She'll be remembered for quite some time. Other standouts performances include Nicolas Cage's performance as Hit Girl's father Big Daddy who was reminiscent of Adam West's Batman and Mark Strong's drug lord mobster Frank D'Amico actually was pretty funny. Matthew Vaughn's third film is nothing short of a miracle because some superhero movies are pretty awful now, I definitely think this will be a cult film from now on.",

This movie really divides people. The movie got a lot of buzz around its release because an 11 year old girl cusses rather graphically and performs gratuitous violence in the movie.  Kick-Ass is a critic's wet dream it's the kind of movie you can bash or praise. Sadly I fall in the category of only liking it halfway so I will give it a mixed review and a mixed rating. The movie has at least three plots, the first consisting of Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) a normal high school kid who likes to read comic books with his friends. One day he thinks to himself why a real person doesn't stands up and becomes a real superhero. He goes and buys a suit from eBay and decides to fight crime. The next one is involving Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) a ruthless, psychotic gangster who son who is played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who blames Kick-Ass for stealing his drugs and killing his men. The last one which caused the buzz, is of Hit Girl played by Chloe Grace Moretz and her father Big Daddy played by Nicolas Cage. That's when the movie hits a down low. Hit Girl is an 11 year old girl who's been brain washed by her father to kill as much bad guys as possible. She cusses like an adult and has very cool ways to kill people.  This movie made a mistake that it should have made clear. Hit Girl's innocence as a little kid. It ignores it completely and just makes her an engine of violence. There is a scene where her birthday comes and she asks for a puppy and Big Daddy looks at her weird. She says she's joking and wants a butterfly knife. Instead of a birthday cake or decorations it's talk about weapons and killing people. No matter how ruthless or mean a young child is that kid still has innocence. The kid can cry and be happy ask for nice things. Kick-Ass ignores that and in the process offends people. There's an emotional scene in the movie that I could not enjoy because of all the ruthless violence. The movie exploits her innocence just to make more scenes of violence and action. I might be exaggerating but I wonder why the hell MPAA didn't give it NC-17 rating. (SPOLIER) Here's something to think about this girl gets brutally beaten by a grown man. I'm a father and don't think I'm crazy I imagined my daughter in that situation.  You're probably saying but just don't think it's your daughter. How I'm I suppose to do that when in this world there's enough sickos who actually like doing that to 11 year old girls. Here's food for your mind how de we know as movie goers that a pedophile likes what happens to Hit Girl in the movie. She's wearing a purple wing with a purple clothes to top all of she has a purple skirt. How do we know if a sick f@#k is sitting in the audience saying yeah that's what she gets? The worst part of it all it's a damn shame this movie fell to that because there all a lot of things that I was entertained with. I laughed at the jokes and liked Dave Lizewskie/Kick-Ass side of his story about wanting to help people. The movie was going to get three stars from me but I can't shake the feeling of seeing (SPOLIER) Red Mist shoot Hit Girl several times in the chest with no remorse, an 11 YEAR OLD GIRL. That's just my opinion though.  The movie had potential but fails. My favorite critic Roger Ebert called it morally reprehensible. I find it morally reprehensible half way. Maybe I'll rent the DVD and see it again, it might change my opinion.  NOTE: Quentin Tarantino use anime to express pedophilia in telling the story of O-Ren Ishii in Kill Bill Volume1 why couldn't director Matthew Vaughn did that for Hit Girl's action scenes.",

That confusion aside, the worst part of this film (and what made it so unbelievable and tasteless) is that the most violent scenes are initiated by a foul-mouthed little girl. There's a scene where she enters an apartment full of drug dealers whom she impales with a sword, while dodging their advances with acrobatic stunts. Even worse than that, the audience learns that her father of all people trained her to do this.

I saw the same thing on wikipedia: the article says the film was well reviewed and goes on to list dozens of sharply negative reviews. There is a gap between internet buzz and the true critical response on this film, but that gap is being plastered over by the writers of online review aggregation sites -- who naturally tilt toward a younger person's perspective. I saw the film tonight and although it briefly flirts with cogent satire, ultimately the film-makers do not know what they want to say and settle for exploitation. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt there.",

This results in a Sometimes flicks are just too damned schizophrenic. Kick-Ass is of those movies. It can't decide if it wants to be a biting satire or a celebration of movie-goers' unquenchable thirst for indiscriminate bloodshed. This results in a film that spends the first third of its story setting up a joke that is then dropped, on a dime, in favor of a second and third act filled with nothing but what the film seemed to want to hate. The Hit-Girl character is the most infuriating aspect of this flick. She kills without remorse, and spouts vulgarities as if she was fathered by Kevin Smith (a less talented Kevin Smith, that is), which is funny. The first time. But nothing is done with this. Nothing of substance analyzed. Nothing of importance poked or prodded at by this character. She is just there to be a tool of that aforementioned indiscriminate bloodshed. Something that wouldn't fly, and would be typically labeled as painfully cliche and pointless; but she is young! So that makes it fresh! And as such, Hollywood's continually deteriorating definition of 'fresh' is exposed once again. I am going to base my theory on what this film's tone was supposed to be upon what I was set-up for in the first act; a satire. This is never capitalized on. This is never even paid attention to. This movie wants so much to be Tarantino-esque. But it doesn't have the the substance, the knowledge, nor the talent to tread those waters, let alone try and dive in. But it did anyway, and was swept under in a heartbeat, ripped apart by whatever lied beneath. What drifts to shore is something so lost, hurt and confused that one's first reaction is to pity it.

Based on Mark Millar's violent tale Kick-Ass is directed by Matthew Vaughn, the filmmaker who happens to have a real knack for both action movies (Layer Cake) and teen fantasies (Stardust). It's more than evident in Kick-Ass and although the film has some problems with selecting the proper tone: it verges between campy comedy, dramatic piece and action spectacle, this is a gripping ride from start to finish.Vaughn's direction is nothing less than clever and kinetic. By employing video game techniques inspired by Shoot 'Em Up and Crank movies, Vaughn really excels at showing highly-stylized bloody violence on screen. As for the script, the main concept of an ordinary teenager who chooses to become a superhero is downright effective evoking loads of laughs and our sympathy. Aaron Johnson's cool, unrestrained performance also helps a great deal.The film revitalizes the genre by undermining its rules. The characters involved have no special powers, most of them, no necessary backstory and no turning point that resulted in them becoming superheroes, much like in Watchmen. Despite this, the movie establishes its own pantheon of heroes and the director knows that there's nothing more fascinating than the battle between good and evil shown in a vivid, exciting fashion.What's controversial about the film is the extensive use of pitch-black humor including the character of 11-year-old Mindy McReady aka Hit-Girl who has been trained from the early years to become a killing machine by her loving father aka Big Daddy. The whole subplot may be immoral for some who don't understand this kind of cinema, yet it's surprisingly plausible due to a tongue-in-cheek writing and acting talents of Chloe Moretz and Nicolas Cage who are as subversive in their respective parts as you can get. Last but not least, the artist formerly known as McLovin' channels a wannabe villain named Red Mist. You may be actually surprised by how smart he is in his plotting.Overall, Kick-Ass is a refreshingly funny and wickedly entertaining spectacle that warrants the whole franchise of masked teenagers to come. 9/10 (A-)",

I thought all the kids who were born in 80s and up ever thought about that, at least once. Thiz movie was very confident since the beginning, they advertise it rapidly and the posters were very intriguing too. It is about Dave (Aaron Johnson), unpopular and nerdy boy at school who wants to be a superhero even without super power. He tried to save the world with alter-ego named kick-ass, on the contrary he got his ass kicked. Meanwhile, Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and her eleven-year-old daughter named Hit-Girl (Chlo\u00c3\u00ab Grace Moretz) who has been the real superheroes were fighting the crime againts drug dealer mob, Frank D Amico (Mark strong). Frank attempted to put his son, Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) as undercover superhero named Red Mist, his intentions was to trap Kick-Ass. Mark Strong once again succesfully brought an interesting villain character. Recently, He had been bad guy for ROCKNROLLA (2008), THE YOUNG VICTORIA (2009), SHERLOCK HOLMES (2009), ROBIN HOOD (2010) and upcoming GREEN LANTERN (2011) and previously many more. He could deliver different bad guy characters with his aura and I admired him for that. I officially gave him Bad Guy of The Year award (if I could). Other casts, Johnson was standard and Cage performance was just what we needed. It is Chlo\u00c3\u00ab Grace Moretz who surprised us with believeable and easy-going performance.

The Director is Matthew Vaughn who directed STARDUST (2004) and respectable LAYER CAKE (2007). Actually on thiz movie, the conversation was rude (considered it as family movie) and the fight scene was bloody brutal, but we have to admit the story was original and effectively hilarious. The movie was brave enough to challenge the mainstream and it worked well in some moments. In my point of view, when we dare enough to laugh on ourself for our own stupidity or feebleness, that is the time we showed the big heart of us.\r Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",

TheBeing based on the comic book of the same name, the movie \"Kick-Ass\" respects the traditions of the comic book superhero genre by consciously getting inspiration from Spiderman and Batman. However, it transcends simple imitation by far. The production of the movie is awesome. Above all mentionable is the film's magnificent use of music. First off, in terms of the script, the movie does a wonderful job in criticizing the perceived lack of responsibility to people passing and watching a crime happen without doing anything against it. If many people start helping in bad situations that are not too dangerous, and if children are already being raised to intervene, everyone could contribute to a more secure society. This would also lessen the chance of getting mugged at some point in your life. On the other hand morally controversial, is the glorification of the revenge murdering committed by two of the protagonists who are less than more on the side of the righteous heroes. Even a woman that was not a threat but tried to flee was stabbed to death. Revenge killing is not a necessary evil for a good cause (as would be a killing in self defense). Therefore, they are hardly any different than some villain who kills for power. Rather than portraying the revenge in a neutral way or actually suggesting that revenge is morally bad, the cinematic glorification of it makes the movie less likable. Nevertheless, \"Kick-Ass\" is totally worth watching.",

Superman is on hiatus because the mostWe have entered the world of post-modern superheroes, where the concept of someone with special powers doing battle against the forces of evil seems quaint, almost boring. Batman is The Dark Knight. Superman is on hiatus because the most interesting thing about him is the John Williams theme. And Spider-Man is in the process of being rebooted because no one could figure out where to take the character. Yet, despite the trials and tribulations of some of the best-known comic book heroes, the genre is insanely popular, and that popularity gives rise to projects like Kick-Ass, which mock and embrace the conventions with equal zeal. Kick-Ass is part hard-core action flick, part parody, and part comedy. Done poorly, this sort of thing can be painful. Done well, as is the case here, it's a blast. It offers a \"have your cake and eat it, too\" experience - you can enjoy the exploits of a superhero while at the same time showing your hipness by laughing at some of the sillier clich\u00e9s. There are so many self-referential layers in this material that it's almost dizzying to contemplate them all.\r Kick-Ass transpires in neither the Marvel Universe nor the D.C. Universe, but in a world very much like our own where superheroes are found only in comic books. The film's protagonist, Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), is a self-admitted \"ordinary guy\" - not a geek, a gamer, a stoner, or Mr. Popularity. He's gangly and a little awkward but lacks the hard-core nerd DNA that afflicts many teen male protagonists. His only superpower is \"an ability to be invisible to girls.\" He travels in a small pack that includes two comic-loving buddies: Marty (Clark Duke) and Todd (Evan Peters). Like many high school males, he has a crush on an unattainable girl - the pretty and popular Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca), but Dave is realistic enough to recognize that she's out of his league and when she smiles in his direction, it's probably because one of her friends is standing behind him.\r The commercials for Kick-Ass make it seem almost family-friendly, which it most certainly is not. This film isn't just violent, it revels in bloody mayhem. There are no taboos. Hit-Girl, who's about 11 years old, is shown casually blowing away bad guys and, later, she becomes the victim of a vicious beating. So much for not putting little girls in danger or showing them doing unseemly things. Of course, in Hit-Girl's case, this is an opportunity for some father/daughter bonding. (Or should that be bondage?) On one occasion, when she tricks Big Daddy into thinking she wants a cuddly puppy for her birthday, he is crestfallen. She then reveals that what she really wants is a cool knife; he is suitably relieved.\r As a superhero, Kick-Ass is an unmitigated failure, and that's what gives the film its edge. His popularity is not the result of things he does but of an image that replicates itself millions of times on computers and television sets. He's the ultimate paper tiger. Dave enjoys the notoriety but also feels pangs of jealousy with all the attention his alter-ego gets. Because he can't take ownership, he wallows in anonymity, which isn't necessarily where he wants to be. And, although his motivations for becoming a superhero are genuine, it doesn't hurt that it provides him with a chance to get close to Katie - even if she lets her guard down around him because she thinks he's gay.\r Kick-Ass is sometimes very funny, but not in the cutesy way it is portrayed in the trailers and TV commercials. Those have sanitized this movie to a PG or PG-13 level when it's really a hard R. The superhero genre has given birth to a fair number of wannabe satires; with the exception of the animated The Incredibles, none has ascended as high as Kick-Ass, which bypasses most of the pitfalls that have tripped up many others. (My Super Ex-Girlfriend and Hancock come to mind, neither of which was awful, but both of which could have been better.)\r The biggest name in a cast of character actors and relative unknowns is Nicolas Cage, who mostly stays out of the spotlight in a supporting role. It's an interesting choice for Cage, who was once tabbed as the next (post-Christopher Reeve) Superman before that incarnation of the hero went into turnaround. Here, he's playing a Batman-type, but his penchant for bloodshed makes The Dark Knight look like a **** Cage is clearly having fun with the role, even going so far as to imitate Adam West's voice.\r The best superhero movie since The Dark Knight (and far less serious in tone or approach), Kick-Ass earns its name in every way.",
