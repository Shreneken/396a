Searching for help at a nearby villa, they are wooed into the clutches of a deranged retired surgeon who explains his mad scientific vision to his captives’ utter horror. They are to be the subjects of his sick lifetime fantasy: to be the first to connect people, one to the next, via their gastric system, and in doing so bring to life 'the human centipede'.

  "critic_reviews": [
    "Unlike its obvious influence, the 1999 Japanese shocker \"Audition,\" The Human Centipede has no real-world echoes. It's an only-in-the-movies sick goof.",
    "Centipede plays on the notion that the only thing more frightening than death is a state bridging life and death, in which, though one's body is no longer his own to control, the mind remains conscious.",
    "Dieter Laser is grand as the doc, a character Christopher Walken would be comfortable doing, and Akihiro Kitamura provides laughs as the first part of the centipede.",
    "This will not appeal to everyone, whether it will appeal to anyone is another question. With dark humour from time to time, underneath an extremely repulsive concept, this is a relatively conventional horror movie.",
    "More of a stunt than a script, The Human Centipede (First Sequence) should get a modest amount of I-dare-you ticket sales, but it's about as mass market as a dogfight.",
    "The only way to react is by bringing a barf bag or a strong sense of gallows humor.",
    "Coprophiliacs looking for a movie that really rings their chimes will be positively tintinnabulating from this arthouse horror number.",
    "Written and directed by Tom Six--who doesn't seem to realize that movie theaters rely on popcorn sales--this nasty stuff plays like a cross between \"Saw,\" \"Naked Lunch,\" and \"Bride of the Monster.\"",
    "Tom Six's movie has the freakiness and sadism of its genre, but it's so heavy with self-appreciation -- Dude, we had the craziest premise for a movie! -- that it can't lift off into the perverse ecstasy of decent exploitation. That was also the problem with \"Snakes on a Plane.''",
    "Only real payoff is seeing the monstrosity assembled, and though that will surely earn the Dutch writer-director a cult reputation on the genre circuit, \"going there\" does not a movie make.",
    "Excruciatingly stupid movie.",
    "Six has now made a film deliberately intended to inspire incredulity, nausea and hopefully outrage. It's being booked as a midnight movie, and is it ever. Boozy fanboys will treat it like a thrill ride.",
    "The movie stinks to heaven.",
    "Crosses the line from horror to just plain sick.",
    "There are terrible movies and there are loathsome movies. And then there's that rare breed so idiotic, exploitative and sickening one wishes they could be scrubbed from memory. The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is such a specimen. Would that I had 100 legs to kick it."

Some horror movies attempt to be original and that is their general appeal. The Human Centipede's appeal? Well it attempts to try to mix these together, but the lack of substance already puts it below what you would normally expect. In addition though, the Human Centipede is a sick and disturbing movie that has no general appeal in its story, and absolutely no substance. The graphic content alone makes the movie nearly unwatchable, but the rest of the movie is just as painful. From laughable dialogue and situations, acting, and a bland mood that doesn't make the movie more exciting or scary. The Human Centipede: First Sequence is just a sick, horrendous movie that no one should watch. From a film and general perspective, this movie is abysmal.",

Different things freak out different people after all. With movies a single disturbing concept can be used to strike fear in the hearts of audiences or get inside their head and screw with their paranoia. Horror can even be used to make people laugh. There are plenty of horror-comedies out there that manage to entertain by poking fun at our terror towards what goes bump in the night. There's simply limitless possibilities for the genre and by being original you can introduce viewers to something new to keep them up at night. I have to give this movie credit for one thing; it certainly is an original idea. I mean, the plot is pretty formulaic, but what writer and director Tom Six is using at the core of the movie to freak you out is without a doubt something original that spawned from his mind. I am of course referring to the bizarre and gross concept of the human centipede itself.Make no doubts about it, this is gross out body horror if I've ever seen it. Something that's gained the movie quite a reputation. A reputation I find to be quite overblown. Don't get me wrong, it's a nasty idea, but the concept is mercifully muted in execution (thank God!). It doesn't overindulge in all the sick little possibilities that likely could have been easily portrayed onscreen. Instead Tom Six relies simply on the inherent disgustingness of the concept to churn your stomach with little extra help. It's something that makes the movie more watchable. Not that you should watch it.At the end of the day all the Human Centipede has going for it is the concept itself. One sick idea is not enough to carry a movie. Something Tom Six makes very clear. Once the human centipede is actually constructed there really isn't any point to the movie. You're just watching Dieter Laser be weird and wondering why the movie is still going on.It all just sort of descends into sadism and cruelty. All of which is really pointless. To make matters worse these victims aren't actually characters. Just bland faces to get stitched up into this hideous creation together. Something that's actually a blessing given that our two amateur female leads can't really act all that well. The dialog they are given doesn't really help either. Dieter Laser is really the only good actor here. Akihiro Kitamura isn't bad, but to be honest I'm not sure if that's because he really is a good actor or just sounds cool shouting in Japanese.In the end Human Centipede is just a deranged concept with not enough movie to keep it going. As far as it's disgusting reputation goes, it's bark is definitely worse than it's bite. Although to be honest it doesn't have much of a bark either, given that all you've heard about it has been blown wildly out of proportion. It's just a B-rated horror film that does something new, only not so well at all. But hey, at least it's original. It's just not very good.",

It actually isn't, it just suffers from a bad use of its budget, which is a shame, because the idea of a, \"Human Centipede,\" is just the disgustingly nasty thing the horror genre needs. The story basically follows a crazy ex-surgeon in Europe who kidnaps two American female tourists and some Japanese guy. You can pretty much tell what is gonna happen to them just by looking at the title, and yeah, he does turn the three people into a human centipede. And yeah, it is pretty effing nasty, and you might gag more than once. Without going into too much detail, I'll just say that they are fused from mouth to rear end, so going number 2 isn't pleasant but quite graphic (Yeah, they show it, and that is one of the nastiest parts of the whole movie.) but the fact that this movie does something any other horror film hasn't shows that it is unique. And unique is something much-needed with all these crappy horror flicks managing to crawl out of the Sci-Fi channel and onto the store shelves where they suffocate the stuff that is managing to separate itself from the group. I'm actually not gonna recommend this movie to anyone, but if you are willing to manage through some sick stuff then I guess this is worth a shot.

But the movie doesn't live up to it. There are some good things aside from this idea, I liked the stylistic nods to Hitchcock and Kubrick, the camera work and lighting are good and while he occasionally resorts to cartoon villainy Dieter Laser has many moments where he is genuinely chilling. Against all this, the story is very predictable and lacking in suspense. Despite the premise, it is actually fairly light on gore and gruesome scenes and this diminished the suspense levels for me. The direction has a lot of style but not a lot of substance, technically the film is assured but the characters are stock and the remainder of the other acting is uninspired. The Human Centipede is a very poorly written movie in my opinion with dully written and delivered dialogue and big, obvious and unforgivable medical errors. Overall, has a good idea but bad dialogue, a lack of suspense and a dull story stop it from being any more effective. 3/10 Bethany Cox",

The acting in the beginning is a bit rough, but let's be honest, if your watching a film called \"The Human Centipede\" chances are your able to over look this for some disturbing content. Dieter Laser plays a good antagonist, a doctor  that is renowned for his surgical skills. And while it isn't the goriest film, the concept of sewing humans together to create one digestive track is enough to make you feel squeamish based on implication alone. It is defiantly not a film for everyone, I would recommend this to those who already like horror that is more then jump scares.",

I will not lie, I am quite a beast and I enjoy such pigs. So I have to warn you from the beginning. If you don't like disgust, I wouldn't see the slightest reason to watch this film. To tell you something. The story isn't much here. At the beginning there is a smaller plot, but immediately it turns upside down and then it's just a matter of perversion. What I have to praise is the choice of an actor for a doctor, who will create here, as the name suggests The Human Centipede. He doesn't even have to play. He's just great. I can barely look at him and I'm scared. This is further confirmed by the fact that he is German and in short it resembles a bit of a Nazi and I am afraid of the Nazis. So it caused me something and I enjoyed the film, but as I mentioned, that's all. So if you're not looking for horror movies where disgusting things just happen, then this is not for you. In addition to all this, there are a few other film clichés that I will not name so as not to pour unnecessarily. For me, the average film that I recommend, as I have already mentioned, only to those who are interested in perversion and do not look for any deep story.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nso, how do i describe this movie...acting is bad at some parts, but you can look through it. The doctor in my opinion plays his evil character amazing, also the other people not so bad. I really loved how they did the location and you trully feel like they are in this place. (lil spoilers)!!! The movie was filmed in germany, thats why the acrs are german, people speak german... some of them speak english too. I really liked that they did everything like its really in germany, ot just make everyone talk english which is mostly done. I also enjoyed the filming stile. It was a little dark and hard to see sometimes, but other than that i enjoyed all the camera shots and transitions (except the fade in the middle).About the movie as a horror movie though, this is not a movie for everyone. First, this doesnt really have jumpscares, it more relies on suspension in some scenes. Second, the gore. This isnt a gory movie for horror movie fans that just want to see blood everywhere (if you want gore watch the Terrifier 2016), but in some scenes there is some blood, but its more just the thoughts and some shots that make you think what is happening. THats where it can get wuite horifying. Please dont watch the movie if you dont like to watch sureries etc.. even tho it has just some scenes of surgeries, the second half of the movie still shows a lot. ---DONT READ BELOW IF YOU HAVENT WATCHED IT, SPOILERS!! OR READ IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHATS GOING ON BRIEFLY!!---Brief story:Two tourist girls want to go to some night club, they get directions but then they get lost in the foresnt, then their tire blows out. Some german guy wants to have sex, then he leaves. The girls walk through the forest, they find a house. The doctor lets them in, gives them watter with \"date rape juice\". They fall asleep, tied to beds. There is a third guy, who the doctor kills and brings an asian guy. He wakes them up and expalins what he will do. One of the girls tries to escape, gets acaught in the pool. Electricity goes out, doctor leaves and the girl tries to save her and her friend, she almost makes it but the doctor stops them. Then surgery.Second part of the movie is diffirent. It shows the span of a few days of the life with the human centipede. not going in any detail here. then 2 german cops come, asking him stuff. He offers them his \"water\", one guy drinks a little the other doesnt, doctor tries to get sleep drugs but he is stopped. Cops leave, doctor goes back down to see where his creature is, but they hid and stabbed him. they all pull themselfs upstairs, where the centipede tries to escape, unsucesfully. The asian guy has enough and cuts his throat. The cops then return, forcing the doctor into the pool area. The first cop (who drank a litlte of his water) gets sick and doctor kills him offscreen. The second one tries to help, goes in the wrong room and sees the abominaton, before he runs off into the pool room, only to be shot and then killed. But he does land a head shot that also kills the doctor. Then the last part of the centipede dies and the middle girl is stuck between two dead bodies to die. The end.IMDB short description:A mad scientist kidnaps and mutilates a trio of tourists in order to reassemble them into a human centipede, created by stitching their mouths to each others' rectums.---END OF SPOILERS!!---The movie:Made in 2009Runtime: 1h 32minKils: 6 (last one not 100%)Actors: 8 + 3 voicesIMDB score: 4.4/10Budget: 1,5 mil €Revenue: 205.539 €My rating: 9/10Note: people who rate it bad because its nasty and gross and diturbing and it gave you nightmares, thats your own fault. Noone said you need to watch it and you should read rewievs before doing so.---SPOILER AGAIN!!---I found a funny mistake also. When the girl spills the water over the table, she puts the glass with litlte water. Next scene the glass is back full. (like magic)---END OF SPOILER!!---Thank you for reading this!:)",
