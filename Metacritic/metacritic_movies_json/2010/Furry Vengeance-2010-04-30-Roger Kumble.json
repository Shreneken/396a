  "critic_reviews": [
    "Goofball fun that will have kids - big and small - rolling in the aisles.",
    "Still, it's refreshing that the animals don't talk.",
    "While Fraser’s presence doesn’t necessarily elevate Furry Vengeance into something better than the dumb, lowbrow timewaster it aspires to be, Fraser does make it a little easier to digest.",
    "This undistinguished picture qualifies as an endangered species. As a digital babysitter, however, it may prove sufficiently efficient to generate fair-to-middling homevid sales.",
    "This is just one nutso, painfully unfunny family flick.",
    "Never before has a movie's direction and script lagged so far behind the actor's hapless persona. If Fraser's character is a human Wile E. Coyote, director Roger Kumble is barely Elmer Fudd.",
    "On the sliding critter-comedy scale, Furry Vengeance falls somewhere between the Chipmunks and the Chihuahua (the one from Beverly Hills).",
    "The message that needs to be posted at the theater door is \"No trespassing.\"",
    "Furry Vengeance isn’t really a movie at all; it's a message provided by the good people at Participant Media.",
    "A collection of feeble jokes in the service of green themes. Sustainability never looked so stupid.",
    "Furry Vengeance is a slapstick stinker, easily the worst movie of the year.",
    "The problem, or problems, stem from the lazy, unfunny script; the weak computer-generated animals (never have God's creatures looked less lifelike while dancing to Chic's \"Le Freak\"); and the squandering of so much talent.",
    "The paradox here is that the message of respect for animal life is outweighed by the lack of respect for human beings.",
    "Excruciatingly unfunny.",
    "Maybe your kids will insist that you see Furry Vengeance. Then again, wouldn't this be the perfect time to let them test their independence and sit through it alone? Otherwise, good luck. You have my condolences.",
    "The movie's simple-minded lesson that forests are good and development is bad is undercut the minute one pauses to think about how many natural resources were wasted on this sorry excuse for a motion picture.",
    "A film so exhausting in its mean-spirited unfunny business that it would prompt Al Gore to empty his recycling bin and light a match to the contents -- and the plastic bin itself -- in full view of news camera crews.",
    "Furry Vengeance would be innocuous enough if only it didn't look as though no effort was made to expand the images past the storyboard phase.",
    "The only saving grace of this wannabe Looney Tune? The animals don’t talk.",
    "Vengeance has the odor of court-ordered community service. The jokes never rise above the groin. The trees look plastic, the characters more so.",
    "Furry Vengeance is unbearable."

We're all adults here. We can agree that it's not a good movie - not even in the typically grating children's genre - but with all the critical bashing going on, I think we should take a moment and focus on who is to blame. It's not Brendan Fraser (who is amazingly committed to even the worst moments of this anemic movie), it's most likely not the writers (credited or otherwise, as there were probably no less than a dozen on this thing - it's been listed on IMDB for at least 5 years), it's not even the editor (who should be given an award for having to sit through who knows how many cuts of what he knew was an unsalvageable film), or anyone else in the cast or crew who, I'm guessing, did it to feed their families. The blame for this and every other painful excuse for entertainment lies with the studio and producers who are there from day one and shepherd it through to fruition. Their sole purpose is to make a product that they believe will make money. Yes, the director should also shoulder the blame of course, but in the end (unless the director is some genius auteur who is afforded final cut) it's the people whose logo is proudly displayed before the first frame of the movie that should be called out by name and forced to apologize for wasting our time. Then again, if we didn't have these movies, we wouldn't appreciate the good ones when they show up every once in a while.",

At least there was a deductive axiom, albeit speculative, behind the blitzkreig of flying rats and Hitch-schlockian birds. \"Day of the Animals\" was a cautionary tale about the hazards of aerosol spray cans. Radiation had denatured the mountain beasts into cold-blooded killing machines, but they lacked a consciousness as to why the humans must pay. \"Furry Vengeance\", on the other hand, offers no such ecological explanation for the woodland creatures' aberrant comportment, in which these animal rebels display antrhopomorphic behavior without a scientific cause, still, whereas the afflicted creatures from the Girdler film ambushed its human opponents without calculation, the fierce raccoon and his furry minions are fully cognizant to the concept of home, family, and rezoning ordinances for the development of upper-class tract housing. A montage which shows the animal wars with mankind throughout he ages, rules out any possibility for a \"Day of the Animals\"-inspired subtext, since the fighting commenced well before the Industrial Age. \"Furry Vengeance\" is just a dumb kid's movie, which is far less ambitious than a dumb political one like \"Day of the Animals\". And it's sloppy. As Dan Sanders, Brendan Fraser plays an ambitious real estate developer who, after getting his ass kicked repeatedly by the wildlife, inevitably has second thoughts about deforestation once he learns that \"animal relocation\" is corporate-speak for \"liquidation\". But the filmmaker provides an inadequate suture for the mover and shaker's rehabilitation, since \"Furry Vengeance\" never deals with the beaver holocaust, in which Dan ordered the construction foreman to blow up the dam.",

Because in my opinion that undermines the point of user reviews, to get an alternative look at films, as opposed to professional critics. This film has the dubious honor of the exception I take to the rule, because (and I've seen the Movie) when you look at the Trailer, you've pretty much seen the full thing. Brendan Frasier acting with all the charisma of the animals he's fighting, fart jokes and a quite frankly depressing enviromental message which seems slapped on in order to try and appeal to those wanting to educate their kids, unfortunatly it falls completely flat because there's nothing intelligent in this film, at all. It's insulting that they think your child would be idiotic enough to find this entertaining. It has the stench of corporate heartlessness about it. I think Brendan Frasier's a good actor but i wish he'd star in good Movies. At the end of the day if your child (or you) does not recall in horror at the extremely uncomedic way Brendan Frasier screams (he's stuck in a portaloo, hilarious!) they will cry at the abysmal effects which were literally puppets Brendan Frasier controlled! I dislike CGI but they could at least try.",

Bukan sebuah masalah besar jika film-film yang ia bintangi merupakan film-film keluarga dengan kualitas yang memorable dan dapat dibanggakan. Namun dengan judul-judul seperti Looney Tunes: Back In Actions, Inkheart dan Extraordinary Measures, yang tidak hanya gagal meraih perhatian para kritikus film dunia namun juga gagal meraih simpati para penonton, Fraser sepertinya harus semakin sering mempertimbangkan film yang akan ia bintangi. Dan Furry Vengeance bukanlah sebuah film yang akan merubah kenyataan itu.Dengan naskah yang dituliskan oleh Michael Carnes dan Josh Gilbert (Mr. Woodcock, 2007), Furry Vengeance mengisahkan mengenai Dan Sanders (Fraser), seorang pengembang perusahaan perumahan yang mendapatkan tugas dari pimpinannya, Neil Lyman (Ken Jeong), untuk membangun sebuah kompleks perumahan yang bertemakan alam dengan menggunduli sejumlah area perhutanan. Untuk melaksanakan tugasnya tersebut, Dan beserta istri, Tammy (Brooke Shields), dan anaknya, Tyler (Matt Prokop), harus mau direlokasi ke wilayah hutan selama setahun.Pada awalnya, Dan mendukung usaha perusahaannya untuk membangun perumahan yang ramah terhadap lingkungan.
