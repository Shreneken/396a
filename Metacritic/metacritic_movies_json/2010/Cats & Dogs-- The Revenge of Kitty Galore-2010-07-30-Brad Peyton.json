  "release_date": "2010-07-30",
  "genre": [
    "Action",

  ],
  "summary": "The ongoing war between the canine and feline species is put on hold when they join forces to thwart a rogue cat spy with her own sinister plans for conquest.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "A faster, funnier follow-up in which CGI-enhanced canines and felines effect a temporary truce to combat a common enemy.",
    "Between the carefully trained animals and their computer-animated mouths, the movie doesn't have much room for realism; but the 3-D effects are surprisingly effective, and this playful pic earns a pat on the head.",
    "With action aplenty, talking animals and enough gags to make any sane grown-up groan, \"The Revenge of Kitty Galore\" is a harmless but fun hot-weather diversion for the family.",
    "A clever, funny movie that will entertain kids and adults.",
    "This isn't so much that the story and characters are weak -- though they very much are -- but that animatronics and computer animation so anthropomorphize these critters that they bear more resemblance to cartoons than actual flesh-and-fur animals.",
    "Stands to delight small children while probably causing their parents' heads to cave in.",
    "Though better than its 2001 predecessor -- and teeming with cute creatures and fast and furious action scenes -- the movie feels excessively formulaic.",
    "The movie is geared to preschoolers, so only parents dragged with them may complain. There's only that Looney Tunes overture to savor before the Acme production begins.",
    "Nine years on from the first movie but somehow the effects have gone backwards and the charm has gone missing.",
    "Tedious time-killer of a kiddie comedy.",
    "Parents in a masochistic mood can compound the headache-inducing experience by paying extra for the 3-D version.",
    "Mostly, though, \"Kitty Galore\" is a grind, as well as proof that \"What up, dog?\" isn't any funnier when a pigeon says it to a dog.",
    "Although it's great fun for the under-8 set and for those of us monitoring the chaos theory that is Nolte's career of late, this film is otherwise mediocre and features some of the most uninvolving 3-D CGI since \"Clash of the Titans\" earlier this year.",
    "About as unremarkable as a film about talking animals organized into competing intelligence agencies can be.",
    "No movie -- whether aimed at adults or kids or canines themselves -- has the right to be as tiresome and unoriginal as this action-comedy mutt.",
    "Aside from uninspired movie-parody gags, Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore suffers from gadget overload.",
    "Is it mindless fun for the kids in an air-conditioned environment? I guess, sure, but it's maddening how many details in Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore are swiped wholesale from other stories.",
    "Fails to deliver enough clever gags, emotional warmth, or eye-popping 3D to compete with recent family releases.",
    "As for the movie itself, it is better than the original \"Cats & Dogs.\" But so is a rabies shot.",
    "The James Bond parodies and genre riffs feel at least 20 years past their prime, and most will fly right over the heads of audience members 7 and under",
    "And it's still, in the spirit of the original film, an unbelievable piece of sh--."

Not in the story part of Cats and Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore. Seriously what company would wait for nine years to make a sequel to a film that didn't need one in the first place. I hated everything about this film. All it was was a rehash of the first films plot which involves a cat bent on taking over the world and some dogs trying to stop the mad feline. The only difference is that the dogs team up with the cats. This film made me laugh a few times, but not enough to recommend this movie. Plus the ending leaves opened for a sequel that will probably never see the light of day. Hopefully this is the final film in the Cats and Dogs Franchise.",

Although \"Cats and Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore\" never quite gives \"Austin Powers\" a run for its money, as far as James Bond send-ups go, this unwarranted sequel is reasonably smart, especially when you consider it's primarily an exercise in talking animals, the most dreaded of all children movie subgenres. Nevertheless, the film has a brain, albeit a pigeon's brain, the size of a pea, as evidenced by the scene where a cat rides a motorcycle, a cat incognito, lodged inside a human dummy. In a lesser talking animals movie, the filmmaker wouldn't bother to acknowledge how people may react to the miracle of a kitty on two wheels. At Alcatraz, however, rather than have a cat mimic Hannibal Lecter, in yet another tired \"Silence of the Lambs\" parody, why not mimic the Zodiac killer instead, since the island prison is off the coast of San Francisco? In this alternative universe, cat and dog technology is clearly ahead of our technology, so the same should be true for canine and feline law enforcement. The animals could bitch and moan about how David Fincher got it all wrong. As for Kitty Galore(a chi chi voiced superbly by Bette Midler), her plan to turn the humans against the dogs sidesteps her real grudge, which is the humans themselves. The popular belief that dogs need human companionship more than cats could've been explored, as man's best friend, once again, would have to save the city from the Zodiac killer, a cat. Kitty Galore's hench-cat looks demented enough to play the part, but due to the constraints of a children's movie, the violence is tempered, limited to knives stuck in a stuffed toy, as the chi chi obviously doesn't need her human owner, a magician(played by Jack McBrayer).\"Cats and Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore\" eventually runs out of inspiration(there is the occasional funny line interspersed throughout the otherwise routine screenplay), and resorts to ripping off Barry Sonnenfeld's \"Men in Black\".",
