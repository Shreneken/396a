One night,The latest film from award-winning Korean director Bong Joon-ho (The Host) is a unique murder mystery about a mother's primal love for her son.

One night, while walking home drunk, he encounters a school girl who he follows for a while before she disappears into a dark alley. The next morning, she is found dead in an abandoned building and Do-joon is accused of her murder. An inefficient lawyer and an apathetic police force result in a speedy conviction.

    "critic_reviews": [
        "An absolutely phenomenal film by the Korean director Bong Joon-ho.",
        "Its combination of dazzling cinematic craft, psychological insight and black humor make this one of the year's moviegoing musts -- and even or especially at her most deranged, Kim Hye-ja's amazing mother is profoundly, passionately human.",
        "Another must-see marvel of horror, comedy, and impeccable filmmaking by the Korean director Bong Joon-ho.",
        "An alluring piece of work, an artful whodunit that melds shrewd plotting with resourceful camera work and sympathetic characters that are fascinatingly, morbidly off.",
        "Again as with Bong's earlier films, Mother is a genre exercise that honors convention, yet weaves around it whenever possible. Bong carefully turns Mother into a classic gumshoe tale, with red herrings, interrogations, and moments of sublime suspense.",
        "To follow up his superb \"The Host,\" director Joon-ho Bong has crafted a remarkable film about love, faith, determination, guilt, and honor, a full-blooded, constantly inventive movie that enthralls, entertains, horrifies and never lets go its grip.",
        "A superb murder mystery, with twists coming thick and fast yet always at the right moments.",
        "The hard-pounding heart of Mother, Ms. Kim is a wonderment. Perched on the knife edge between tragedy and comedy, her delivery gives the narrative -- which tends to drift, sometimes beguilingly, sometimes less so -- much of its momentum.",
        "A Hitchcock-ian murder mystery that unfolds into a maternal melodrama worthy of Joan Crawford, shot through with bursts of black humor. Bong's ability to sustain three or four different tones in one movie without betraying the emotional truth of the story is nothing short of amazing: He can pat his head, rub his stomach, and break our hearts all at the same time.",
        "You never know where Mother is going to go next. All you know is that you're in the hands of a master with an appreciably bent sense of humor.",
        "The film is labyrinthine and deceptive, and not in a way we anticipate. It becomes a pleasure for the mind.",
        "The easy comparison here is to Hitchcock, but Bong moves at a slower pace, more like Claude Chabrol.",
        "Bong's film starts out as a comedy, transforms into a quirky Agatha Christie whodunnit and finishes with an unpredictable Hitchcockian flourish.",
        "Bong's style is comically tart even in the film's most noirish moments.",
        "Korean maestro Bong Joon-ho\u2019s (The Host) playfully off-kilter Hitchcockian thriller refuses to play by genre rules, stir-frying slow-burn menace and Freudian drama into unpredictable combinations.",
        "Mother is a thriller as well as . . . something else.",
        "It may be slow by Hollywood standards, but it's accessible at every moment, and we come away feeling that human character is more complex, and perhaps darker, than any studio is willing to test an audience with.",
        "A chilling, intense character study.",
        "Moments of great suspense are sometimes invested with intrinsic humor, moments of trauma can yield great compassion. Often, these seemingly conflicting tones exist all at once, while the oblique mystery never clearly identifies the correct emotion.",
        "Mother is yet another winner by Bong, one of Asia's most talented directors.",
        "Mother delights in confounding viewer expectations. In fact, just when you think it's over, a couple of plot developments remain lurking around the next corner.",
        "Mother symbolically doubles as Mother Korea, devoted to her land. But is she blindly and uncritically devoted, too quick to forgive and forget sins that should be redressed, to treat any flaws in the national character as simply intrinsic to the country's nature?",
        "The movie's utter lack of predictability helps to keep you engaged, even if some of the plot turns are a bit baffling, and the unusual depth and complexity of the characters -- the eponymous heroine in particular -- give the picture its unusual, scalding power. You've never met a mother quite like this one.",
        "A deadpan, darkly funny Korean murder mystery.",
        "Key casting is aces, led by a deglammed Kim, forcefully low-key as the mother who seems capable of anything to protect her son.",
        "The fact that Mother keeps its balance is a tribute to the leading actress.",
        "For all its jarring sound design and herky-jerky pacing, founded on sudden incidents or shocking accidents, Mother is deftly plotted, applying Hitchcockian suspense with a Hitchcockian sense of fair play.",
        "Bong's stylistic embellishment of the simple tale of a mother who will do anything to protect her son is breathtaking.",
        "Bong's opening and climactic scenes, in which the old woman bops around to a dance tune amid a vast field of yellow grass, are typical of the movie's cockeyed poetry.",
        "Bong is so concerned with whodunit that his creaky genre mechanics diminish Kim's determined performance.",
        "Though diligently paced and sharp to look at, the mysteries inside Mother are, finally, bloodless."

On the face of it,Korean auteur Bong Joon-ho returns with yet another masterful revisionist genre film. He's already tackled the murder-mystery (Memories of Murder) and the monster movie (The Host), now he turns his hand to the thriller. On the face of it, Mother doesn't appear to have much in common with run-of-the mill thrill-rides, but like it's title character, the film can be deceptive. What could be more thrilling than a Mother's desperate (and sometimes morally questionable) journey to prove her son's innocence? Mother is a taut, grounded psychological thriller with a liberal dose of Bong's trademark jet-black comedy. There are numerous heart-pounding moments, but also plenty of quieter, well-placed emotional beats to bring you crashing back down to reality. Bong continues to prove he is a master of character - and the mother (Kim Hye-ja) and mentally ill son Doo-joon (Won Bin) are among his finest creations to date. Kim is simply mesmerising throughout, and while some of the mother's actions are questionable (and others downright evil), you're always on her side - it's a great character.  Another fine film a Korean master.",

South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho follows his monster extravaganza  \"The Host\" (2006), in firm control of his medium in a different genre, proving once again that conventions need not always confine.\r After a night of drinking and waiting for his long time friend, Do-joon (Won Bin), finds himself in some serious trouble. The next morning, he is accused of murdering a young woman on his way home from the bar, and he has no recollection of whether or not he did. The case has enough evidence to be closed quickly, but his mother, played by Kim Hye-ja, refuses to believe that her son could do such a thing. So she pushes forward, not accepting  what the police have pieced together, and starts her own investigation to find the real killer, and free her son.\r The film is a labyrinthine and cleverly deceptive, and not in a way we might anticipate. Long after a conventional thriller would have its destination in plain sight, \"Mother\" is still penetrating our assumptions. There are twists are aplenty, and deductions achieved too easily are simply the result of contrived clues and convenient witness testimony. \"Mother\" delights in confounding viewer expectations. In fact, just when you think it's over, a couple more developments still remain.\r The film progresses with remarkable clarity, while drawing surprise and suspense from unexpected places. It's director Joon-ho Bong's unique style of old and modern approaches to filmmaking  his stylistic and subtle ability to weave this story, and employing a witty use of dark humor throughout is what makes this film so impressive. \"Mother\" slowly burns its way towards revelations and depths of a character's soul that most dramatic thrillers shy away from.\r The most surprising aspect of \"Mother\" is how differently it begins, and from that, what it becomes. Unique and utterly compelling in its entirety, \"Mother\" concludes in a manner that solves all (or nearly all) outstanding riddles. \"Mother\" deftly weaves a story about mother's love into a mystery thriller that will keep you guessing every step of the way.",

They've produced such gems as \"Oldboy\", \"Samaritan Girl\" and \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" and none of them ever cease to amaze me. Joon-ho Bong's \"Mother\" reminds me of the Coen Brothers' \"Fargo\" (one of my all-time favourite films) in many ways. It juggles genres effortlessly and excels in every single one of them. At times, \"Mother\" is a hair-raising thriller, but at other times it has wonderfully witty comedic tones. At its heart, however, the film is an oddball murder mystery led by an incredibly beautiful performance from South Korean soap opera star Hye-ja Kim. Edited and shot with dynamic precision, \"Mother\" is not only too gorgeous for words, it's also easily one of the best films of 2010.",

Mother is a crime movie, but it is also a character study and in parts a psychological thriller. The movie first follows Do-Joon (Won Bin), the mentally challenged young adult son of a single mom (Kim Hye-ja). Do-Joon is easily duped and has the mental capacities of middle to an early high schooler, despite being in his twenties. The narrative shift focus to the mother after Do-Joon is convicted of the murder of a young girl. Shortly before her murder, Do-Joon was drunkenly returning home, vaguely following her, because he liked her. What follows is the epic journey of a single mom, downtrodden by media, society, and the economy, trying to prove her son\u2019s innocence and catch the real culprit. The movie takes this somewhat simple narrative and uses it to explore the faults with the criminal justice system, class warfare, and ableism. Just when the viewer thinks they have caught onto where the movie is going, the movie reveals new details subverting the narrative and tropes. Mother has many things to say, but the most potent of which is a meta-critique given at the last moment. Mother shows the power that enough dedication to a task can have, but it also shows the futility and consequences of the dedication.",
