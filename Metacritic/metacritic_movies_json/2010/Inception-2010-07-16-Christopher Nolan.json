Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible—inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming. This summer, your mind is the scene of the crime. [Warner Bros. Pictures]… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "In terms of sheer originality, ambition and achievement, Inception is the movie of the summer, the movie of the year and the movie of our dreams.",
    "If Inception is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's filmmaking -- an activity devoted to constructing a simulacrum of reality, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave a lasting impression. Mission accomplished.",
    "With physics-defying, thunderous action, heart-wringing emotion and an astonishing performance from DiCaprio, Nolan delivers another true original: welcome to an undiscovered country.",
    "Nolan blurs the distinction between dreams and reality so artfully that Inception may well be a masterpiece masquerading as a summer blockbuster.",
    "The visuals are stunning, perhaps the most fully realized of any film.",
    "Inception does a difficult thing. It is wholly original, cut from new cloth, and yet structured with action movie basics so it feels like it makes more sense than (quite possibly) it does.",
    "Inception is precisely the kind of brainy, ambitious, grand-scale adventure Hollywood should be making more of.",
    "When was the last time you had your mind blown by a movie? Because when Inception ends and the lights come up, you'll be sitting in your seat, staring at the screen, wondering what the hell just happened.",
    "A tremendously exciting science-fiction thriller that's as disturbing as it sounds. This is a popular entertainment with a knockout punch so intense and unnerving it'll have you worrying if it's safe to close your eyes at night.",
    "This is spellbinding, transporting, damn near indescribable and the latest indication that Christopher Nolan might be the slyest narrative tactician making movies today.",
    "This is a deeply felt work of art in the form of a big, brassy movie-movie.",
    "The film is an imposing, prismatic achievement, and strongly resistant to an insta-reaction; when it’s over, Nolan still seems a few steps ahead of us.",
    "In a summer of remakes, reboots and sequels comes Inception, easily the most original movie idea in ages.",
    "In this wildly ingen­ious chess game, grandmaster Nolan plants ideas in our heads that disturb and dazzle. The result is a knockout. But be warned: Inception dreams big. How cool is that?",
    "Here, finally, is something you've really never seen before.",
    "The film is easier to admire than to fully grasp or be moved by it. Still, it's worth surrendering to the dream.",
    "Inception is that rare film that can be enjoyed on superficial and progressively deeper levels, a feat that uncannily mimics the mind-bending journey its protagonist takes.",
    "The versatile actor brings the full weight of his talent to bear on a difficult role. DiCaprio has to hint at unpleasant secrets in Cobb's past while forging a bond with the audience. It's up to the performer to make Inception more about human beings than about special effects. He succeeds and that's one reason why this movie isn't only about challenging ideas and eye candy.",
    "Nolan’s tale is not only a trip through mental labyrinths but a reminder that memories may cripple us, unless we learn to let them go.",
    "What Nolan has created with Inception is the rare movie that is bound to improve with repeated viewings, both as a means to drink in its brilliance one more time, and to see what sly clues might have flown under your radar the first time around.",
    "Inception is one of the best sci-fi movies of the new century, a mind-bender about dreams as public spaces.",
    "As engrossing and logic-resistant as the state of dreaming it seeks to replicate, Christopher Nolan's audacious new creation demands further study to fully absorb the multiple, simultaneous stories Nolan finagles into one narrative experience.",
    "A sensory and intellectual overload from start to finish, a brawny, brainy summer movie that may infuriate as many viewers as it enraptures.",
    "Inception, though, is no \"Avatar\"--instead, it’s the movie that many wanted \"Avatar\" to be. In a roaringly fast first hour, we’re introduced to a new technology that allows for the bodily invasion of another person’s dreamworld.",
    "Nolan’s end-act pacing has always felt ponderous – but it’s not enough to ruin what is surely the most intellectually and viscerally engaging action film in years. The soul doesn’t stir, no, but everything else is wildly somersaulting.",
    "Inception is an elegant, portentous ride, though I’m not sure Nolan is any closer to visualizing the real (dream) deal than Hitchcock was.",
    "One of the best things about Nolan as a director is that he’s not self-conscious. His movies unfold and fold in on themselves without the strain of labor or flash. But that lack of self-consciousness is also Nolan’s downside.",
    "The film is Nolan's labyrinth all the way, and it's gratifying to experience a summer movie with large visual ambitions and with nothing more or less on its mind than (as Shakespeare said) a dream that hath no bottom.",
    "For movie buffs, the only real fun to be had at Inception could be toting up the lifts from other movies, including Cocteau’s “Blood of a Poet” and “The Matrix” series and just about anything by Kubrick.",
    "You can’t feel for anyone when nothing feels real. Memo to Christopher Nolan for future outings: Kill the dream, tell a story.",
    "At the end of Inception, I hadn't lived through the grueling emotional journey Nolan seemed to think I had, but I'd seen a bunch of cool images and admired some technically ambitious feats of filmmaking.",
    "Stymied by a clunking script, crammed with expository exchanges and urgent blather.",
    "Christopher Nolan's \"Memento\" was a movie-lover's dream come true, a puzzle that was engaging both intellectually and emotionally. But his Inception is a wake-up call, a blaring reminder that cheap tricks can't compensate for personal investment.",
    "Though there is a lot to see in Inception, there is nothing that counts as genuine vision. Mr. Nolan’s idea of the mind is too literal, too logical, too rule-bound to allow the full measure of madness -- the risk of real confusion, of delirium, of ineffable ambiguity -- that this subject requires.",
    "Inception delivers dazzling special effects and a boatload of stars, but it sags and eventually buckles under the weight of its complicated premise.",
    "Inception, is an astonishment, an engineering feat, and, finally, a folly.",
    "By convoluting the various planes of experience, by overlapping and obscuring ostensible realities and ostensible dreams, Mr. Nolan deprives us the opportunity of investing emotionally in any of it.",
    "Inception manages to be clunky and confusing on four separate levels of reality.",
    "For the most part \"Inception\" is a handsome, clever and grindingly self-serious boy-movie, shorn of imagination, libido, spirituality or emotional depth. Nolan establishes a fascinating world, loaded with trapdoors, symbols and hidden secrets, and then squanders the opportunity on an overpriced \"Twilight Zone\" episode.",
    "It's obvious that Nolan either can't articulate or doesn't believe in a distinction between living feelings and dreams--and his barren Inception doesn't capture much of either.",
    "Everything he (Nolan) does is forced and overthought, and Inception, far from being his ticket into hall-of-fame greatness, is a very expensive-looking, elephantine film whose myriad so-called complexities -- of both the emotional and intellectual sort -- add up to a kind of ADD tedium.",
    "I'd like to tell you just how bad Inception really is, but since it is barely even remotely lucid, no sane description is possible."

There are a lot of unknowns in the dreamworld.2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns.3. its edgy drive - although you know what's coming next but still you feel jumpy about it.4. its fast storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times, it's hard to keep up, even at the second viewing.5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I believe.6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.Cons:1. its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film, if you ask me.2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more than enough characters than necessary. They may play some roles in the plot but they seemed more of distraction than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused.3. a bit preachy - I noticed the characters would explain things about the dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I'm afraid, Inception overused this trick.In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement.I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks, if you dig this kind of flicks.Cheers!",

Looked good with good actors but to be honest it left me cold. It became a' nightmare'. I will give it another go because Michael Cane was in it and Leonardo, two greats. By the way I thought Dark Knight was crap. Nolan seems to be a pretentious, self indulgent, up his own dark place, kind of person. Bring back the good old psycological 'Hitchcockian' thriller. I've just realized I'm overful of 'special effects'. This is just bilge dressed up, isn't it? Dissolusioned, yet again.",

I've heard the word visionary thrown Nolan's way, but this film was the work of a rather sterile imagination. Yes, it had many layers of narrative cleverly interweaved with eachother, but there was little to compel me at its core. The root cause of Cobb's state of mind just didn't grab me - partly as this relationship was never given the chance to develop to a tangible level. The elements of subconscious displayed were tame and the approach to the dreamworld rather banal - focusing as it did mainly on bland designs, bendy gimmicks and exploding things. There was little edge to Nolan's vision, he seemed quite happy to drown us in relentless exposition and unimaginative slow-mo shots. Scenes were very quick and at no point approached the atmosphere and interest of a real dream. A shame, because at their best, this is what films can do - engineer the quality of a waking dream. Compare Inception to the more intriguing work of Lynch, where scenes seduce with the perfect balance of the real and surreal, and whose images tend to linger in the mind. On top of this, Nolan is simply not a very good director of action; he is quite loose with the camera, and I yearned for more flair and invention in these scenes. Instead, he relied on an incredibly insistent score to give the action some punch. For a film about dreams and the subconscious, it was curiously impersonal and mechanical. Certainly, the real danger and sexuality of the subconscious might scare off mainstream audiences, but Nolan was given free reign to do what he wanted - so why not do something more interesting? Freud and Jung would find little to interest them here, as the film is less concerned with psychology and more with the narrative possibilities afforded by a convoluted dreamworld fiction. Perhaps Nolan does dream of corporate worlds and Bond fortresses. Unfortunately, such things don't interest me.",

Christopher Nolan is quite new to some people, but what he has done here is taken the money Warner Bros. have given him for the two Batman films he made and he has created something quite extraodrinary. Its a complicated film which for some may be quite long and boring, but for most its most incredible 144 minutes ever in the history of cinema.

As befits a film written and directed by the guy who made Batman cool again, it's heavy on the action and visual arts. As befits a film written and directed by the guy behind Memento, it has a mind-bending plot. What's the movie about? The most basic of questions: what is reality? It plays with us by sending its characters into ever-deeper layers of dream states in search of a MacGuffin. And while the film ostensibly delivers the obvious enigmatic ending, it's scattered with hints that suggest a further hidden layer. How clever. By the time my bladder had insistently declared its presence, I was bored with the spectacle. For the film is indeed a spectacular, the sort of thing Hollywood does well. It's also an example of what Hollywood spectaculars often don't do well; it fails to connect with the emotions, with our sense of empathy. This, despite a plot in which the love interest is a central device. Ellen Page is terrific as the spunky, wisecracking, rule-breaking girl who gets pregan.... wait, let me start over; Ellen Page is terrific as the spunky, wisecracking, rule-breaking sidekick. She's also at risk of getting typecast as a spunky, wise.. well, you get the idea. Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as the thinking man's tortured action hero. He looks great. Everyone else is a cipher, including the aforementioned love interest.  I'm sure that Inception is a visually stunning, intellectually intriguing movie.

Not to say I didn't enjoy it the first time around.  It's just that watching it for a second time I could follow everything that was going on, and hence I felt a lot more engaged in the story.  This really is a brilliant film that challenges the notions of space and time, reality and dreams, and truth and ideas.  And it does it in an action-packed way. The dream sequences (which make up more than half the film) are also very beautiful to look at.  It reminds me a little of David Lynch's \"Mulholland Drive\", which also polarised critics, and also took a couple of viewings to fully grasp.  However Inception may be a little more accessible with its more familiar cast.  I wish there were more films like this, that get you thinking, instead of the dumbed down fare we mostly get out of Hollywood.  We know that films like this can be made, but its more often about box-office takings these days, and beautiful people.  Thankfully films like this have a high replay value.",

Cristopher Nolan, su director [Memento, El caballero de la noche/Dark Night] es respetuoso con el espectador, no exagera y tampoco ofrece contenido gratuito que desmerezca las capacidades intelectuales de su público. La historia está presentada de manera prácticamente impecable porque no deja cabos sueltos y los que quedan trascienden el argumento volviéndose irrelevantes [cómo funciona la tecnología para invadir sueños, en qué marco temporal transcurre la historia o el pasado de algunos personajes de los que el mismo no es relevante para el argumento]. La trama aborda los procesos oníricos de una manera muy interesante y científicamente «plausible» sin embargo se tomaron algunas licencias para justificar los sucedido en la pantalla y eso está muy bien para la historia y muy bien por parte del director porque nos permite construir con mayor fidelidad y veracidad la fantasía que surge como exposición al contenido del film. Aquellos que estén familiarizados con los procesos oníricos así como la mitología y el psicoanálisis [con fuertes raíces mitológicas] se van a deleitar con las referencias expresas, algunas de ellas tan sutiles como los sueños:\r *Ariadne, el personaje de Ellen Page que se encarga de la construcción de los laberintos oníricos, toma su nombre del personaje mitológico griego, la hija del rey Minos, que le da a Teseo una bovina con hilo para que desenrolle y pueda salir del laberinto del minotauro a medida que lo incursiona.\r *El uso del agua como conducto entre el mundo de los sueños y el real, al igual que la fuerza de gravedad que suele ser un fenómeno que despierta a la gente con bastante frecuencia.\r *El empleo de la canción «Non, je ne regrette rien» de Edith Piaf como alerta que tienen los personajes para salir de los sueños porque Marion Cotillard [Mal, la esposa de Cobb] ganó el oscar como mejor actriz protagónica en 2009 por el rol principal en la adaptación cinematográfica de la vida de dicha cantante «La vie en rose».\r *El hecho de que la esposa de Cobb se llame Mal y represente la fuerza destructora del inconsciente de Cobb; fuerza que puede ser comparada al arquetipo de la sombra en la psicología Jungiana.\r *La ralentización de la percepción del tiempo en el estado onírico y su factorización exponencial a medida que se incrementan los niveles de profundidad del sueño.\r *La preparación anticipada que hace Cobb a Fisher antes de la inmersión en el inconsciente de este último: lo hace recordar a su padre y procesar cierta información respecto del mismo para que sea lo último que recuerde antes de dormirse y lo utilice como material de acceso inmediato en la construcción de su realidad onírica.\r *El personaje principal representado por Leonardo Di Caprio se llama «Cobb» [un tipo de araña] y su función es moverse por los laberintos construidos cual telas de araña para confundir a su presa, atraparla y obligarla a que se rinda para que ceda la idea que está buscando.\r ___Si bien en ciertos puntos se puede comparar esta película con la trilogía «Matrix», sólo puede hacerse si uno se basa el similitud de algunos conceptos como el de las realidades irreales y la presencia de mecanismos de defensa dentro de cada realidad que se manifiestan como proyecciones antropomórficas no obstante «El origen» ofrece una experiencia diferente que está basada en el conflicto interno que surge cuando la realidad que nos rodea es amarga e indeseable y una realidad alternativa es lo que más se añora, la capacidad que se tiene para influir la vida de los demás con una simple idea y las consecuencias catastróficas existenciales que eso puede tener tanto para la víctima como morales para el victimario.\r ___«El origen» es un film que debe ser visto porque es generoso, respetuoso, delicado y gratificante aun si su final no es lo suficientemente contundente después de todo lo que hay que atevesar como espectadores; toda la experiencia vale sus 146 minutos de duración. La realidad fantástica que nos propone Cristopher Nolan requiere de una módica cuota de voluntad y atención considerable pero retribuye con la sensación de haber visto algo complejo en un lenguaje simple, rico y directo que sin duda alguna gratificará a muchos.\r (c) Palfrei. 2010-08-16.\r Reseña completa [técnica]: http://palfrei.blogspot.com.ar/2010/08/ooxiii-resena-el-origen-inception-esp.html",

Not only because it is unnecessary complicated to begin with, but ultimately because the spectacular action scenes ride roughshod over any deeper concepts.\rThe idea that one can enter another's dream and manipulate it is not new. Nor is the confused blending of what is 'real' or 'unreal'. Nor is the choice for living in a make belief paradise, however fake this paradise is. It is not whether you belief it that matters, but how much you belief in it.\rThis what the movie is about. The idea that one can implant an idea in someone's consciousness that is so strong that it steers him(or her) towards a desired behavior. In this case to prevent a company from gaining total control over the world's energy sources. It has to be big of course, we want nothing less.\rThe hero, Cobb, is thus hired by by the business suit Saito to implant an idea into the head of the son of his big competitor, the latter who is a dying man. Cobb has his own reasons for taking the job and so a deal is made.\rNow that must have sounded a bit too straight forward.\rSo to make it more complex, we are served a superfluous first part, that has nothing to do with the main story, other in that it introduces Cobb and Saito to us and some concepts. It is a waste of time which should have gone to the main story.\rThe center story requires that Cobb kidnap his target and induces him to sleep, and also to enter his dream and then a dream in that dream and then a dream in that dream and even a dream in that dream to pull of the job. Cobb needs a team to do that job as he can't do it all on his own. And that team swells from an original four to six people in all. Not counting the captured son.\rWhy?\rIt isn't that, amidst the explosions and the gunfights, there is enough time for some meaningful personal interactions to develop. Indeed, whatever interaction there is, is between Cobb and his wife Mal, yet another figure introduced into the movie, and between Cobb and Ariadne, the other woman in the movie, who, of course, tries to unearth what Cobb is struggling with because the story wants her to(And because she is that other woman?)\rCobb gets cleansed in the end by facing his deeper inner demon Mal on dream layer 4, prodded by necessity and Ariadne. It sounds cool, but it is mostly confusing.\rAnd as if reaching dream layer 4 wasn't deemed to be unbelievably dangerous and impossible to do, -level 3 required a special medicine -, Cobb simply goes into dream layer 5 on a whim. By now the movie has been completely uprooted.\rWe have been told before that time slows down with each subsequent layer. Hence, at dream level 1 every 5 real time minutes are an hour, at level 2 it is a week, and at level three it is 10 years or something like that. So what is it at level 5? It must be a 1000 years. And to get out of the dream, one needs a kick. So what kick is there at level 5? And if the team can conjure up weapons as happens in one scene, why do they not conjure up a robot army to help them out? And then apparently the team has superhuman fighting skills, for they fight off waves of attackers who are luckily so inadequate that they even miss their targets from ten feet away firing automatic rifles, while getting shot by mere handguns.\rPerhaps though, the most disappointing were the mundane dreams. It immediately qualifies the director. Instead of capturing the surrealism and strangeness of dreams, he prefers to deal in explosions.\rIn the end the movie is dominated by the word too. Too much complexity, too much people, too much explosions. With a smaller cast, a simpler story that centers around the tragedy in Cobb's life it would have been a stronger movie altogether. Now it is just hubris.\rA final note: Thumbs up for Ellen Page and Ken Watanabe. Both of them fine actors.",

This view was illustrated byA pretty good thriller that steps into tedium a few too many times. What is quite remarkable about this film is that it has gained a reputation for treating its audience like intelligent, thoughtful people. This view was illustrated by British film critic Mark Kermode when he used it as a primary reason to place Inception at the top of his best of 2010 list. I am quite surprised as I really didn't find this film to be much more demanding or hard to follow than most films. This is due largely because of the over expository dialogue. There were entire reams of it that were so laden with explanation that I cringed at times. I'm surprised that they didn't just wheel on Basil Exposition to explain the next part of the plan. In contrast to many reviewers I felt patronised by the script and that it didn't trust the audience quite enough with the various complexities of the plot. Leonardo is currently stuck in a 'I'm a bit edgy, little bit mad' mode - differences between his role in this and Shutter Island are inscrutable. Tom Hardy? Not sure about him yet. Caine was certainly my favourite thing about this. The final set-piece was brilliantly executed but I feel that the entire first part of the film served as little more than groundwork for it.

As we soon learn, gaining information from dreams is difficult enough, but to implant information (a process called, you guessed it, inception), is a different story entirely. If you must know the plot, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are hired by Saito (Ken Watanabe) to perform inception on Robert Fischer, Jr. (Cillian Murphy) in an effort to convince him to divide his father's (Maurice Fischer [Pete Postlethwaite]) company (this, as Alfred **** would say, is the MacGuffin). After consulting his old teacher, Miles (Michael Caine), Cobb picks up Ariadne (Ellen Page), Eames (Tom Hardy), and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), to assist him and Arthur on their mission of inception. There is also a side story involving Cobb's wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), and their two children. My plot synopsis ends here, as saying more would detract from the amazing moments you'll witness on-screen.Those who have seen director Christopher Nolan's 2000 effort, Memento, will not be surprised by Inception's requirement of the viewer to take each scene as it comes. Viewers and critics have called the film confusing. It's not confusing, it's complex. The film itself is explained in detail, and without the usual boring dialog that screams \"Did everybody get that?\". There's even well-timed comedic moments that serve to break the tension. The difficult complexities of the film come from what is not seen, the bigger picture, happening outside the parameters of the movie. This is why Inception has been the subject of debate on forums, blogs, and even around dinner tables. It's as though Nolan puts the viewer in the middle of his maze, gives them the map, then turns them loose; but, there's a catch, the edges of the map are burned and faded.The technical side of the film is near perfect. I can't recall another film where the special effects and cinematography were better matched to create a visual buffet that simultaneously feeds our hungry eyes and mind. Nolan's long-time cinematographer, Wally Pfister, has done a great work here that tells the story as well as the actors and their dialog. All the while, Hans Zimmer's score flows throughout the film, taking us where we need to go. While Nolan and his crew juggle the technical side of the film, Leonardo DiCaprio, and his cohorts, are in full-form as we journey alongside them through dreams inside of dreams.Inception is that rare treat that comes down the line when a studio (in this case Warner Bros.)  is smart, and brave, enough, to take a chance on something great and original. If you see one film in the theater this summer, make it Inception.",

Well, perhaps my expectations were a bit high after one of my film snob friends called it \"the first truly important film of the century.\"  It's moderately entertaining, but calling it anything more than a decent movie is a bit of a stretch.  People call it original, but it's like a dreamworld version of the Matrix (which used ideas that had already been around a while, but at least made it exciting).  However, a dreamworld should be so much more than just a sterile, realistic environment.  My thoughts about how bland the dreams are here was magnified after watching the Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.  That's a movie that showed true imagination and creativity.I do enjoy other Nolan films (i.e. Memento, TDK), but I felt no thrills here.  Part of the problem is that there is no real consequence of failure.  Sure, you may be stuck in \"limbo\", but it's just another level of dream and you may not be able to escape, but at least you aren't dead.The snow level was particularly irritating as it just seemed like it was pulled straight out of a modern shooter game.  It was very reminiscent of a level of Call of Duty: MW2.It's also amusing to me that the antagonist is named Mal, which means \"bad\".  Really, we couldn't have come up with a better name to call our villain than \"bad\"?  It was by no means horrible, but really, I don't see why it's called original, or amazing when it's merely entertaining.  It's an average movie with an above average effects budget.",
