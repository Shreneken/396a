In this family comedy event, the \"Duke\" is living large in Orange County, California. But fitting in with his new four-legged friends – and a potential romantic interest -- isn't always easy for a super-sized teenage dog. (20th Century Fox)… Expand",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "If you like the comic strip, now in its 56th year, maybe you'll like it, maybe not. Marmaduke's personality isn't nearly as engaging as Garfield's. Then again, if personality is what you're in the market for, maybe you shouldn't be considering a lip-synched talking animal comedy in the first place.",
    "The film’s most impressive feat may be bringing a cartoon character to life while turning actual humans into 2-D cutouts.",
    "As doggy movies go, this one gets two paws out of four.",
    "Hey, it’s all good clean fun.",
    "Like \"Sex and the City 2,\" Marmaduke features well-coifed bitches in heat, nonstop puns and its very own Mr. Big. Unlike \"SATC 2,\" this one is harmless and, on occasion, mildly witty.",
    "An afterthought of a plot ships the family from Kansas to the O.C., offering SoCal set pieces -- like a doggie surfing contest -- to spackle the few gaps between big-dog-small-world jokes.",
    "With extended closing credits, Marmaduke clocks in at 88 minutes and feels longer.",
    "These cinematic feats are accomplished with meat-cleaver editing and awkward, jittery computer-generated imagery. The well-cast voices for the expressionless animals are at least good for a few smirks.",
    "Brad Anderson’s long-running saga of the melty-looking Winslow family and the gangling, interfering Great Dane that should’ve been put to sleep ages ago gets a film treatment.",
    "For the most part the jokes here are tired. William H. Macy is a welcome presence in the small role of Phil's offbeat-but- intense boss.",
    "It’s truly a milquetoast Scooby Snack for pet-friendly families who thrill to computer-generated mouth movements on real-life four-legged critters.",
    "A dull but harmless big-screen comedy aimed at the youngest movie goers.",
    "One thing Marmaduke does have in common with the earlier Disney titles is a blessed scarcity of crass bodily-function gags that often pass as family comedy.",
    "Wilson's amiable vocal work keeps the predictability from becoming too grating.",
    "If Marmaduke achieves anything, it's that it makes this past spring's \"Furry Vengeance\" look like a masterpiece by comparison.",
    "It's an intermittently amusing parable about an outcast's ascension, as performed by a pack of digitally manipulated dogs. Next.",
    "\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua,\" we owe you an apology. Among talking-dog movies, Marmaduke is the runt of the litter.",
    "Marmaduke saves its farts for the beginning and end, but the stink carries through the whole movie.",
    "It's harmless.",
    "The movie itself is already like one long commercial.",
    "Very small children may well take a shine to the big, goofy dog and his furry friends, but parents and older siblings will be left squirming in their seats at a bland, predictable blend of bad comedy and sentimentality.",
    "We’ve just been treated like a fire hydrant."

Not anymore, it isn't Marmaduke is a dull film about a live action dog, where the humour is mainly dancing animals and farting. Oh, and William H Macy getting knocked over. Twice. I know, the film is intended for children, but seriously?Kids like this garbage? I suppose they also like Batman & Robin then The reason I haven't given this film a 0 ratingis because the live action actors, such as Lee Pace and William H Macy, act well, despite the godawful script which could've been written better by two five year olds. They manage to endure the rubbish and act professionally. It's also impressive how many good actors the film got for voice actors. Kiefer Sutherland, Owen Wilson, Christopher Mintz-Plass, Chris Colfer. Must've been paying them a lot. So, if you get to the cinema and find all films but Marmaduke are sold out, go home. It's not worth the admission of the cinema ticket. In fact, it's better for you to take a ten pound note and place it in the shredder. It's more entertaining, has better dialogue and is a better value for money than seeing Marmaduke. I think i'm gonna Marma-puke",

      "content": "If Gabriele Muccino's \"Seven Pounds\" was a single-panel comic, and not a tear-jerking movie starring Will Smith, Rosario Dawson, and a Harlequin Great Dane named \"Duke\", maybe the strip would resemble \"For Better or For Worse\", the If Gabriele Muccino's \"Seven Pounds\" was a single-panel comic, and not a tear-jerking movie starring Will Smith, Rosario Dawson, and a Harlequin Great Dane named \"Duke\", maybe the strip would resemble \"For Better or For Worse\", the award-winning slice-of-life comic strip by Lynn Johnson, known for its realism, in which characters aged and sometimes died, like the Patterson family's sheepdog Farley, who drowned while saving four-year-old April. In one conjectural edition of a \"Seven Pounds\" strip, the caption might go something like this: \"Great Danes live only for seven years,\" as accompaniment to an illustration in which Emily tells Tim about Duke, while they all sit contemplatively in the long golden grass of an open field. These gentle giants are fragile creatures, susceptible to gastric dilatation-volvulus(aka bloat), a stomach condition that's characterized by overstretching due to an accumulation of gas, a potentially fatal malady which can be exacerbated through overexertion. Marmaduke(voiced by Owen Wilson), a Kansas hayseed new to the west coast, uses dogs; in particular, uses Maisy(voiced by Emma Stone), who helps the great dane court Jezebel(voiced by Fergie), a pedigreed collie(shades of \"Some Kind of Ruff-derful\"), as he climbs the social ladder, and in return, discards this motley assemblage of curs without any compunction for their feelings. In actuality, hanging out with purebreds is advantageous for Marmaduke, independent of the cachet that goes along with being popular. Like juvenile delinquents who lure you into bad decisions, these mutts encourage the great dane to expend himself on a kinesis-based video game called Dance Storm. While Marmaduke can recognize himself in the mirror, and TALK, he lacks the anthropomorphic capacity to discern his own mortality. On the other hand, as the conquering alpha male at the dog park, Marmaduke lounges around on a pedestal. It's not snobbery; it's survival. Arguably, the mongerels are a bad influence. Even worse, Phil Winslow(Lee Pace), the dog's master, forces his pet on a longboard, and enters him in a surf contest. It's no wonder that Marmaduke is flatulent. Played for laughs, the dog's farting is probably a symptom of bloat. Marmaduke is dying.",
