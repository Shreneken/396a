  "critic_reviews": [
    "With a thieves den of borderline-Shakespearian characters, a wickedly literate screenplay, potent direction by David Fincher, an exceptional ensemble cast and subject matter that speaks to a generation and well beyond, The Social Network is mesmerizing.",
    "The result is a ripped-from-the-Zeitgeist film that is razor-sharp, an astute and funny portrait of the early 2000s, with all its LOL's, its IMO's and its WTF's. Mostly its WTF's.",
    "The power of The Social Network is that Zuckerberg is a weasel with a mission that can never be dismissed. The movie suggests that he may have built his ambivalence about human connection into Facebook's very DNA. That's what makes him a jerk-hero for our time.",
    "It's one of the best movies of the year, one of the best entries ever in the Way We Live Now oeuvre.",
    "On the level of craft, the movie's just absurdly enjoyable. Sorkin's dialogue dazzles; the photography is burnished and sleek; the editing confidently sorts out a complex narrative.",
    "The performances, direction and writing of one of the best pictures of 2010 make this Social Network every bit as addictive, and a little chilling as well.",
    "This is a remarkable film for more reasons than its antihero, from the cyberspeed wisdom of Aaron Sorkin's screenplay to Jeff Cronenweth's camera prowling the excesses of youthful genius gone wild.",
    "David Fincher obsesses about obsessive people.",
    "Most of all, it is the improbably entertaining story of how new media are altering the very nature of courtship and friendship.",
    "Keep your eyes on Garfield - he's shatteringly good, the soul of a film that might otherwise be without one. The Social Network is the movie of the year. But Fincher and Sorkin triumph by taking it further. Lacing their scathing wit with an aching sadness, they define the dark irony of the past decade.",
    "A work deeper than its nickname, \"The Facebook Movie,\" hints at - coils around your brain. Weeks after seeing it, moments from it will haunt you.",
    "A film that's at once timely and timeless.",
    "Terrific entertainment - an unlikely thriller that makes business ethics, class distinctions and intellectual-property arguments sexy, that zips through two hours quicker than you can say \"relationship status,\" and that'll likely fascinate pretty much anyone not named Zuckerberg.",
    "The Social Network has understandably been compared to \"Citizen Kane\" in its depiction of a man who changes society through bending an emergent technology to his will.",
    "This account of Facebook's founder, and of the website's explosive growth, quickly lifts you to a state of exhilaration, and pretty much keeps you there for two hours.",
    "The rewards for paying attention are mammoth and exhilarating. This is a high-IQ movie that gives viewers an IQ high.",
    "Shot to shot, scene to scene, The Social Network nearly never puts a foot wrong or, really, does anything to make you feel less than compelled.",
    "David Fincher's film has the rare quality of being not only as smart as its brilliant hero, but in the same way. It is cocksure, impatient, cold, exciting and instinctively perceptive.",
    "Smartly written by Aaron Sorkin, directed to within an inch of its life by David Fincher and anchored by a perfectly pitched performance by Jesse Eisenberg, The Social Network is a barn-burner of a tale that unfolds at a splendid clip.",
    "Delivers the heady, rib-tickling rush of an action picture, and it gradually builds to an emotional wallop that blindsides you.",
    "But make no mistake, whether the movie is fair or horribly unfair - I know nothing of the actual facts and can't make that determination - its portrait of Zuckerberg is a hatchet job of epic and perhaps lasting proportions.",
    "The film owes much of its success to the inspired pairing of Fincher and Sorkin.",
    "The founding of Facebook becomes a tale for our times in this masterful social drama.",
    "The film comes down to a mesmerizing portrait of a man who in any other age would perhaps be deemed nuts or useless, but in the Internet age has this mental agility to transform an idea into an empire.",
    "Continues Fincher's fascinating transition from genre filmmaker extraordinaire to indelible chronicler of our times.",
    "It's a grandly entertaining reminder of everything we used to go to the movies for (and still can't get online): sparkling dialogue, thorny situations, soulful performances, and an unusually open-ended and relevant engagement with a major social issue of the day: how we (dis)connect.",
    "Brilliantly entertaining and emotionally wrenching.",
    "Quite possibly the first truly great fact-based movie of the 21st century.",
    "Fincher and his screenwriter, TV writer-god Aaron Sorkin, have made a seemingly modest picture that achieves something close to greatness the old-fashioned, slow-burning way: By telling a story with faces, dialogue and body language of all types, from awkward to swaggering.",
    "Zuckerberg's story ends up feeling bigger than his own life.",
    "When Mr. Eisenberg makes Mark's face go blank, the character seems scarily emptied out: it's a subtly great, at times unsettling, performance.",
    "All I can say about Timberlake's performance as the thoroughly odious, desperately seductive, textbook-case metrosexual Parker is that he brings so much reptilian fun that he unbalances the movie, almost fatally.",
    "Blisteringly entertaining.",
    "Eisenberg, one of those young actors who has existed just below the radar for several years now (he was the lead in both \"Zombieland\" and \"Adventureland,\" not to be confused with one another), deserves an Oscar for this dead-on portrayal of a temperamental genius.",
    "It has the staccato wit of a drawing-room comedy, the fatal flaw of a tragic romance and the buzzy immediacy of a front-page headline, all powered by a kinetic engine typically found in an action flick. And that's just the opening scene.",
    "Is director David Fincher's film the stuff of greatness? Not quite. But the picture is very, very good.",
    "The problem is, the geek in question, at least as Jesse Eisenberg plays him, doesn't have the emotional expansiveness to fill out a movie. Perhaps sensing this, the filmmakers play out the story line from multiple points of view and crowd the stage with a pageant of voluble supporting characters.",
    "The Social Network wants to be a social satire, a miniaturist comedy of manners, and a Greek tragedy; it bites off a lot, at times more than it can chew. But even the unmasticated morsels are pretty tasty.",
    "A rich, understated character drama that gleefully exposes the petty playground politics at the centre of one of the internet-era's most bitter court cases.",
    "This film transcends its trendy, obvious limitations with enough vitality and vitriol to make it as informative and breathless as it is entertaining.",
    "Corny as that is, the film's nadir comes when Zuckerberg's pretty young lawyer comforts him (or us) with the mealy-mouthed observation, \"You're not an asshole, Mark. You're just trying so hard to be one.\"",
    "It's an entertainingly cynical small movie. Aaron Sorkin's dialogue tumbles out so fast it's as if the characters want their brains to keep pace with their processors; they talk like they keyboard, like Fincher directs, with no time for niceties."

The only memorable scene that comes to my mind is the Winkelvoss brothers' at the Dean's office. Frankly, I do not understand all the hype for this movie. Eisenberg was good at depicting a selfish and antipathic protagonist, that's true. The music was good. However, the story was so annoying that I think they put Justin Timberlake and party scenes in the second part of the movie on purpose - Facebook was founded and there was nothing more to say, so Fincher had to lighten things up.",

The story is told through flashbacks from courtroom tribunals between Zuckerberg and the people he has managed to wrong. This is confusing as it switches from one law suit to another without giving any idea of which came first. Add to this one is abruptly dropped from the film and focus is centered on the other I began to wonder why not focus on one in the first place. One of my biggest problems with the film was Jessie Eisenberg and writer Aaron Sorkins Portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg. As one character puts it \"you're not an  but your trying very hard to be one.\" This is the perfect description of the character, who is completely unlikeable with his rambling monologues and irritating behavior. The rest of the cast too is unbearable and i would struggle to find I a character Iiked. The direction too leaves a lot to be desired as director David Fincher struggles at making one scene different from another as all anyone seems to be doing is sitting at a computer. The film seems to require a degree in computer programing as the character spew technical lingo constantly, helping add to the difficulty following the plot. Add to this a terrible ending and you would think this was the worst film ever, however for some reason the film was one I couldn't stop watching for some reason.\rRating 4 out of 10\rMuch like facebook this film is a waste of time that you can't stop looking at",

It's based on the true story of Mark Zuckerberg and the creation of Facebook (which you may have heard of), and the tensions which arise amongst the people around him as a result of the site's creation. If you're looking for a historically accurate depiction of Facebook's creation, you may want to look elsewhere. The facts surrounding the creation of Facebook were heavily distorted in order to create a compelling screenplay ('Erica Albright', the girl who inspires Zuckerberg to create Facemash at the beginning of the movie, doesn't even exist in real life). Nevertheless, the distortion of facts can be overlooked in this case, as the screenplay will still keep you hooked from beginning to end. There are no glaring weaknesses in any other area of this movie. Fincher's direction is simply outstanding. The score is fits the movie well.  Almost every character is perfectly cast, including Eisenberg as Zuckerberg, Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin, and even Justin Timberlake as the pretentious Sean Parker. If you're looking for a fully accurate storyline, then The Social Network may not be the movie for you. Even so, I'd still recommend it to anyone who enjoys good movies.",

The film is a technical masterpiece on every level and is so rewatchable that it delightfully seizes your attention from the moment the first scene comes into focus. The \"Social Network\" is a movie that thrives on the beauty of each scene and how they are masterfully edited together to provide a piece of art that fits together like it's the world's most satisfying puzzle. The movie begins with a simple scene between Mark Zuckeberg, played masterfully by Jesse Eisenberg, and his fictional girlfriend Erica Albright, played by Rooney Mara. The beauty of this scene is how naturally it sets the tone for the movie, the motives of the main character, and how the music score is attention demanding as it is in every scene in this movie. This scene shows us that Mark is a man that desires social respect from people over anything else. The opening bar scene between him and Erica displays how he thinks intellectual achievements should lead him to all what he thinks will bring him a most fulfilling life: fame and success. The \"Social Network\" shows how this ideology can lead to us losing our closest friends in the vast and complicated web that the social experience can be. The movie gets its heart from the character Eduardo Savron played by Andrew Garfield. Garfield's emotional portrayal of this character is so gripping and relatable that it now seems like a crime that his performance was not met with an Academy Award for best Supporting Actor. The back and forth dialogue between Eduardo and Mark are some of the best parts of the movie. These scenes not only show the brilliance of the screenplay written by Aaron Sorkin, but also the Oscar level performances given by Eisenberg and Garfield. The performances in this movie don't stop there, though, since both Hammer and Timberlake give very solid performances as the Winklevoss twins and Sean Parker respectively. The Winklevoss twins symbolize the privilege and status the Mark wishes he had while Sean Parker symbolizes the attitude that Mark believes he needs to have to get there. These characters are pivotal to developing Mark's journey for why and how he soon becomes the youngest billionaire in the world. What makes the \"Social Network\" truly special is how it takes such a simple story and turns it into must watch cinema. The score is consistently blood pumping and masterful throughout the entire movie. This fast paced score, combined with the rapid editing and dialogue take a simple story and make it a heart pumping story of the societal pressures of being \"cool\". \"The Social Network\" is David Fincher's first masterpiece and it relies on his direction. The direction he takes with this story combined with the master class technical aspects make this movie one of the best pieces of cinema the 21st century has seen.",

My Prada's at the cleaners! Along with my hoodie and my **** you' flip-flops, you pretentious douchebag!\"The Social Network is DEFINITELY the best movie of the year about the substantial growth of the disreputable but well-off website, Facebook. Everything was magnificent, with the well-written screenplay of Sorkin and great direction of Fincher, its simply the best. People did give second opinions about this movie (being about facebook), but the Social Network is the complete opposite of what they thought.This film is set in 2003, about a Harvard sophomore named Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), that comes up with an idea (while \"intoxicated\"). And creates a website that allows you to rate the hotness of girl in Harvard dorms, which reaches 200,000 views and brings it's attention to the Winklevoss twins. They meet up with Mark and tell their idea of making a social network, using \"Harvard.edu\". Thinking that he can do better, he meets up with his friend, Edwardo Saverin, and decides that they will make the website instead (splitting the share 30/70). when Facebook gets around, Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), creator of napster, wants to get in with the project, and gets a warm welcome from everyone except Saverin.//I don't want to tell you the whole movie (even though you probably already know), so I think I'll stop there. The Social Network was directed by the one and only, David Fincher (Zodiac, Fight Club, Se7en, and more), and is his absolute best work. The best acting would have to be tied with Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfeild, showing their best support for a movie. I wasn't surprised when I found out that Peter Travers (Rolling Stone) said that this was the best of the year, and it should of won the Grammy, instead of Kings Speech. But it did win the Grammy for best soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, for film editing by Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter, and for the adapted screenplay (of course) by Andy Sorkin.In the two-disc collectors edition, it shows Fincher's distinctive technique in film making. shooting the first scene for ninety-nine times, David's patient directing tries to make this movie be perfect as possible, and of course, is successful. Fincher and Cronenweth made a great choice using the best High Def quality so far, by RED Digital Cinema. It interests me a lot that almost every known movie coming out recently, is being filmed in RED. I looked it up and most of the products they sell is well-over 20,000 dollars (must be really good). They're using it again while they reunite to work with a new remake of \"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\", which I have high hopes for.Andy Sorkin's adapted screenplay is one of the most intelligent and skilled I have seen so far. nonetheless the screenplay being so complex, it must of been complicated for the editors (Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter). But by cutting all the camera angles and showing everybody have their spotlight, they succeed and win an Oscar for their tremendous support. The costume design was nothing special, but is will put into, wearing the same clothing that they wore in real life (not exactly). You can never get enough of The Social Network, watching it the thousandth time still gives me the same satisfaction as the the first time, if not more. You can't miss a second of this movie! if you love this film as much as me, buy the two-disc collectors edition, because who wouldn't love over two hours of special features.

Fincher's flashback storytelling didn't make me feel like I was getting different perspectives and narrative layers. Rather, I felt like I was watching an intervention where everyone else could freely speak except the very person at the centre of the screen. Instead of a balanced, well-rounded portrayal of the facts, the filmmakers dramatised the whiny testimonies of scorned 'victims' to depict a character so contorted and contrived he didn't look like a real human being. Someone as aware of his brilliance as the on-screen Mark Zuckerberg wouldn't feel insecure enough to crave acceptance into a final club. His natural genius would set him apart enough and he wouldn't waste time garnering adulation from less intelligent people to affirm that. The movie depicts the cinematic Mark Zuckerberg being so engrossed in creating revolutionary projects that he pays very little attention to social conventions and appearance. Yet the same acutely logical person wastes a chunk of the movie being envious that his friend Eduardo is more 'popular'. To create a Shakespearean-like tragedy, Aaron Sorkin afflicted the protagonist with various 'fatal flaws' to amplify conflict. Facts were twisted to fit into the salacious story the filmmakers wanted to tell. Real people were twisted to fit into the salacious characters the filmmakers wanted to show. The movie was nowhere as clever as it thought it was and by the end of the first scene you knew exactly what it was trying to say ('social misfit invents new way to socialise'). It's as if the filmmakers started the film with that message and then worked backwards, fitting real life people and events around that theme rather than use the truth.  At its worst, TSN was slanderous non-fiction masquerading as entertainment. At its best, it was entertaining fiction masquerading as fact....Either way for me it didn't live up to its hype.",

I have no idea what any of equations or algorithms mean, or how to write script.\rMaybe Iâ€™m a little jealous because I never got to go to college parties as glamorous as the ones in this film?\rOr maybe the problem is that the subject matter it just so banal that despite the quality of the production, this film is lost on me?\rI have a problem with this film that is so full of maybes. And yet for all its weaknesses, it won three Oscars, albeit one of them was for Baxter and Wall's editing, which is superb. Both editors have worked on numerous Fincher productions.\r None of the actors are convincing at portraying the real people they are supposed represent. Maybe thatâ€™s the point? They are attempting to play versions of Zuckerberg and Co. that seem more interesting than the real, live versions.\rI guess I see the reasoning behind this. As activities, creating companies, programming computers, or writing software, no matter how profound, arenâ€™t exactly as riveting as invading Bin Ladenâ€™s compound, or smuggling blood diamonds out of Liberia.\rStill, I am no fan of Jesse Eisenberg. His success is baffling to me. He was for a while a Michael Cera impersonation gone wrong, now, whatever he is, he does it well. He sells tons of ticketsâ€¦but none of them are to me.\rThe best part about this film is that it has Rooney Mara, briefly. Later she becomes Lisbeth in Dragon Tattoo.\r The most interesting thing about this film is simply that it exists and was so successful. Rather, that a production company actually paid David Fincher to try and create a full-on thriller packed with betraying, greedy, snarky little boys either getting their way, or losing millions of dollars. Poor babies.\rEven if in the end Zuckerberg did create something monumental, so what. It's just a monument to a monument. What does any of this represent? How does any of this change the world?\rItâ€™s not like Facebook has cured any sick people or stopped any wars. Itâ€™s arguably even created a recent few (of both).",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThe Social Network opens with an extremely strong scene that establishes Mark Zuckerburg as a genius and somewhat of an **** while also introducing one of the major components of the movieâ€“crew, or rather the twins that rowed it. We are also introduced to Mark's other lawsuit with his best friend Eduardo when he obsesses over final clubs, one of which Eduardo actually became a member of.\r Mark's potential as a computer geek and as a successful person in general is really shown from the beginning with facesmash and the capability to really shut down Harvard's whole network. He does get hated but also gets found through this website. Women (understandably) are angry with him, yet he comes up with this amazing idea with the help of these twins. I was also particularly struck by his lack of interest with money. He had his own startups in high school, yet he \"didn't sell it, uploaded it for free.\" Seems like someone who's just so enamored by these ideas that nothing on the business side even comes to mind for him. That's Eduardo's place.\r It also doesn't even seem to occur to Mark that he might get in trouble for his actions. Does he even have consequences? Mark Zuckerburg is a very flawed protagonist. The truth is that he's just a real human being and we see the many sides of him and the many sides of the story. I couldn't fully sympathize with Mark because of the way he did act to certain people, yet I would find myself not sure if I was cheering for him or not because I truly understood each argument that the others were making. \"If you guys were the inventors of Facebook, you'd have invented Facebook.\" Very true â€“ Harvard Connection really was not the same thing and there was much gray area involved.\r One thing that bothered me though was the way those two girls were introduced that Mark and Eduaro hooked up with, and Eduardo began dating Christy. But they treated them as if they were intellectually incapable yet they both attended Harvard. I sensed a thread of misogyny throughout that is unfortunately a part of the technology industry. (Again, this is something I would love to try to change in my life.) The movie had really unique ways to introduce new topics in a seamless fashion. One that I noticed the most was how we saw Sean Parkerâ€“the founder of Napsterâ€“and realized who he was just how that girl did. We really saw Facebook evolve as a company as the movie went on.\r Something that really struck me was how this was a \"once in a generation idea\" which is actually probably true. Facebook has been so revolutionary in my life. I grew up before Facebook and it wasn't until my later years in school that this was really a thing so it's been amazing to see the exponential growth in social media, honestly instigated a lot by the success of this one website. Love it or hate it, it's revolutionary.\r We ultimately see three people screwed out of this company and its fortune, all thanks to Mark Zuckerburg. They receive their settlements and life goes on, but I guess this level of success can't happen without such events as the damages that Mark did to his only real friendship here. \"You're not an **** Mark. You're just trying so hard to be.\" -Marilyn Delpy (Rashida Jones) Now Mark Zuckerburg is the youngest billionaire in the world and no one can say that the things he did in this movie were not worth it for where he's at today, with over 1.4 billion users.",

I accepted this film for what it is: verisimilitude, somewhere in between fiction and non-fiction.  What we are left with is a captivating story with substantial characters and engrossing on-screen interrelationships.  A scene which really made in impact on me is the opening scene with Jesse Eisenberg's and Rooney Mara's characters.  Jesse Eisenberg's dialog immediately shows him to be an intelligent but socially inept person perfectly introducing him as a questionable character.  Questionable because throughout the movie I was asking myself: is he arrogant or ignorant?  Is he really the anti-hero or is he easily led, unaware of the emotions of others?  The sequence of events is sometimes non-linear, especially so in the beginning section but I found interpreting the different scenes involved me actively in the movie and was refreshing.This was a movie about a phenomena that has touched every one of us (even those who don't have Facebook know what it is!) and, even though some may debate about whether it really tells the tale, it was a brilliant movie, entertaining and inspiring.",

Director Dave Fincher and writer Aaron Sorkin's depiction of the roots of social networking site Facebook is an engrossing film that not only defines the current technology-based generation, but sets film standards of brilliant writing and film structure.Fincher and Sorkin's film tells the fascinating story of Mark Zuckenburg and how he made a small idea into the billion dollar corporation Facebook. The story is shown through flashbacks and flash-forwards, simultaneously addressing the lawsuits made towards Zuckenburg, and the dark and gritty story of the formation of Facebook. While the accusations of Zuckenburg's thievery of intellectual property are in tact, many of the film's details are debatable.The incertitude of Zuckerburg's story is what makes this film works.  Portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Zuckerburg's ambiguous character is the film's focus and what makes it so appealing. Is Zuckburg driven by the rejection of his girlfriend (Rooney Mara), or is it superficially the thought of money? The character's innocent and snooty manner is a mystery that establishes this film.  Eisenberg gives the performance of his life as he puts so much depth in the character and raises so many questions.Supporting Eisenberg is Andrew Garfield, who I once again have to give praise.  After seeing a powerful performance from Garfield in Never Let Me Go, his role as Zuckerburg's co-founder really shows his ability to take on diverse roles.  Garfield gives an accurate portrayal of a deceived friend, and the subtlety that he puts into his performance is mesmerizing.What gives the characters this type of depth is Aaron Sorkin's Oscar-worthy screenplay.  I cannot recall a film with this much witty and movie-driving dialogue.  I can not emphasize the film's screenplay brilliance, it really gives the film reality, depth, and entertainment value. Resulting from the script, the plot is fast-paced and addicting; It keeps the audience curious and occupied for the whole movie.  But while the plot and script are almost perfect, there is an absence of a big moment.  The movie is no doubt intense, but there are no moments that standout from the overall film; There is no buildup of emotions in a single scene, something I believe a perfect film should have.The Social Network is a movie that many will look back as a defining 21st century work of art.  Overall, Fincher's film is modern, provocative, and technically flawless. The Oscar race has started, and the writing in The Social Network will be hard to beat.",

Ultimate Perfection. The script is what drives this film into the best movie of the year, with the cast as a bonus. David Fincher keeps all the drama extremely factual. It takes you on a journey from Facebook's roots, to what it's become today. Mark Zuckerberg is shown as the #1 betraying asset in this film.

My only regret is that I didn't walk out sooner. I found this film so boring that I almost fell asleep. All this \"clever\" talk by a bunch of rich, spoiled kids, which just droned on and on. I found not a single interesting character in this film. Let me be clear that I am not a \"social networker, \"so perhaps that influenced my thoughts about this stinker. Maybe if you're infatuated with My Space or Twitter, or whatever, this film would have a different impact on you. Let me also say that I am a college graduate (and also have a professional degree), so it's not that I'm some low-life that can't appreciate artistic films. I really can't understand why this movie got such good reviews. Sometimes I agree with critics, but this was not one of those times.sI thought is was important to take a stand on this one, to dare to disagree with the critics and to call this dreadful movie's bluff!.",

The story was supposed to be just a mess with lawsuits and betrayal of friends. But writer Aaron Sorkin turned the story into a must-see of the decade. He turned it into a witty, fast-paced, thrilling, and an Oscar-winning script. Luckily, The Social Network got David Fincher (Curious Case of Benjamin Button) as a director, which makes it even better. David Fincher's achievement in this film is going to score him another Oscar nod. (Fincher is directing The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, English version, my favorite book). The actual Facebook story is about Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), a Harvard undergraduate (computer genius), who wrote the code for the Facebook website. Teaming up with him was him roomate Eduardo Saverin, whom later sued him for... well lots of **** Mark ran into playboy Sean Parker who convinced Mark to \"betray\" his partner (Eduardo), that's what lead to the law suit. Though people say Aaron Sorkin's script is an inaccurate potray of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who in real life is down to Earth and not an **** like in the story, I say he was just trying to make the story A LITTLE more interesting than it already is (sarcasm). Aaron Sorkin not only made the story more interesting, he made it smarter and more thrilling. Performance wise? I will have to admit that I think The Social Network will dominate the Oscars in the acting categories. Jesse Eisenberg gave one hell of a performance! Since he had been playing a loser-with-no-girlfriend kind of guy, this is really typical for him. His fast talking and annoying ass attitude really stole every scene that the camera sets on him. Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake also gave fine, dramatic performances which MIGHT earn them an Oscar nod. But in terms of Jesse Eisenberg, he is guaranteed an Oscar nomination (he might even win considering there is no other good movies this time of year). Directing, writing, and acting all great in one movie is rare (to say the least). The Social Network succeeds in every assets that the film was trying to achieve.",

A great movie, a 10, is The Lives of Others, Tokyo Story, The Leopard--films like that. That said, a key reason The Social Network is so over-praised, and many viewers and critics are so thrilled by it, is because so many viewers and critics of the film, critics especially, are bi-coastal Jews who are thrilled by the film's story about a \"meritocratic\" Jewish \"genius\" at Harvard who screws the WASP Porcellian aristos, whose club he could no more join than jump over the moon, out of the profits for their own idea by stealing it. It's the ethnic and class politics that make the film over-rated the way Sophie's Choice, a good but not great film too, also was. David Denby in The New Yorker even calls Zuckerberg a \"hero.\" Of what? Moxie? Chutzpah? By that standard, Madoff was a super-hero. At the same time, the film itself seems almost a critical meditative allegory of the way the battle for money and status in America that Jews have had to wage, by hook or by crook, against the once-dominant, anti-Semitic, and exclusionary WASP upper-class has warped some Jews and undermined the moral values of both the Jewish religion and secular Jewish humanism. In fact, Zuckerberg in the film is the most negative image of a Jew in a mainstream American film I can recall. He's an arrogant, creepy, borderline sociopathic jerk, with no evident ethical principles at all. He happily stabs his Jewish only friend in the back right along with the WASPs. He's a sort of Shylock of software, but much less ambiguous morally and humanly than Shakespeare's great creation. He makes Sammy Glick look like nothing. Sorkin and Rudin seem deeply interested in the cost of the Jewish race for wealth and status in Madoff's America. A timely theme indeed, and one that must be especially pertinent for Hollywood insiders like them. For unethical Jews from Madoff to Zuckerberg, America seems to have been closer to Babylon than Jerusalem, and this is a point well worth making in a film like The Social Network. Zuckerberg is a sort of book-end with Dustin Hoffman's breakthrough role for Jews in The Graduate forty five years ago. That Mike Nichols film cheered, and we all cheered with it, as Ben stole Katherine Ross from the Berkeley WASPy golden boy at the Christian altar itself. It was about time that Jews won victories like that in America with hustle and character (vs. the WASP's frat boy entitled vapidity). But instead of presenting a likable Jewish hero at odds with \"plastics,\" The Social Network gives us a total jerk unredeemed by his clumsy geekiness, a thief who seems to personify the cost in corruption of forty years of endless, relentless striving by Jews on the make like Zuckerberg in Madoff's America.",

It's incredibly dark, even during the day. It's as if I'm watching the movie with dark-tinted sunglasses the entire time. The screenplay is undeniably Sorkin. Conversations drag on for extended periods of time, often losing track of their main focus. It's clear there was some sort of disconnect between Sorkin and the director because Fincher just can't keep up most of the time. The music is annoyingly painful most of the time. It does nothing new within the ambient genre, neglecting original performances for a neglectful, dark atmosphere. Like the film itself, it is overrated.Acting wise, Jesse Eisenberg does a great job, but only because he's playing what he's good at: himself; the nervous, meticulous, obsessive, socially-awkward nerd who thinks academia is what's most important in life. Everyone else is so incredibly bland, I wouldn't be surprised if there was no effort involved whatsoever.Concerning the subject, the general idea is correct, but the specifics are muddled. I'm sure Sorkin realized halfway through writing how uninteresting sitting in front of a computer and creating Facebook really is, so he focused on the only drama throughout the entire experience: lawsuits. Unfortunately, they're handled poorly in the film. I have to wonder if it isn't fact-based, then why exactly is it focused on Zuckerberg and Facebook? I've come to the conclusion it was decided to use a much more overly dramatic, fictionalized view of the events and center it on Facebook because it sells. And my does it sell.",

At least it informs you out front what it's about, unlike some fish movie, purporting to be some kind of thriller or murder mystery music thing. This film is about a dinkhead, and how unfortunately, dinkheads make it. John Lennon was correct. Biggest B-heads around, make it. SAD. That's ultimately the trip, but sad in another way than expected from the other facebook film.",

I was actually really surprised about how well done The Social Network really was. A good 2 hours long, it didn't feel like it was endless, but it left me wanting more. The acting was generally good, but the movie's strength comes from its incredible screenplay and it's brilliant direction. From Alien 3 and Fight club to Zodiac and Benjamin Button, David Fincher has come a long way, and all of that hard work has paid off with a near-flawless film. The shots in The Social Network are just beautiful, and the cleverly ingenious writer should be commended. I can definitely say that this year's Oscar's ceremony will be a no-brainer!",

Jesse Eisenberg is perfect in the role of the very bright yet (very) gauche and socially inept young Mark Zuckenberg.  He knows just how to play this kind of character, he did it so well a few years back in \"The squid and the whale\" .  In my opinion this film is, in many ways, the perfect film: great cast, great dialogue, plenty of character development and above all exciting.",
