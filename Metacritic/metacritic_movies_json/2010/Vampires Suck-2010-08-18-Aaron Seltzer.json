    "The exception is newcomer Jenn Proske, who spoofs Twilight star Kristen Stewart's flustered, hair-tugging angst with hilarious precision.",
    "After a lucrative career of bashing well-made scary, epic, disaster and date movies, Friedberg and Seltzer have a source begging to be mocked.",
    "\"Vampires\" doesn't suck, exactly, but the laziness and lack of imagination kinda bites.",
    "This pointless parody dumps us in the fictional town of Sporks, Wash., a location lousy with vampires and werewolves.",
    "As if a string of bad jokes wasn't enough, Vampires Suck is full of distractingly forced pop culture references and shameless product placements (the actors practically mug for the camera while holding various products).",
    "The main performers do a reasonably good job of parodying the \"Twilight\" leads, with Proske particularly effective in subtly lampooning Kristen Stewart's moody mannerisms.",
    "Two very important things to note about Vampires Suck: The film is a spoof of the \"Twilight\" movies, and the title is a good indication of where the level of wit lies.",
    "Non-\"Twilight'' fans would be better off surfing YouTube.",
    "If Kristen Stewart ever saw Vampires Suck, she'd be scarred for life.",
    "That Vampires Suck is a step above god-awful is something of a miracle.",
    "The boys similarly deserve very minor props for choosing a satirical target that lends itself to satire: the glum, self-important Twilight novels and movies. Sadly, that's where the filmmakers' mild accomplishments end and the groaningly predictable hackwork begins.",
    "A Twilight pastiche with all the wit you'd expect from the makers of \"Scary Movie\" and \"Meet The Spartans.\"",
    "The lame mediocrity of Vampires Suck undeniably reps an advance for writer-directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. By just about any other standard, however, this instantly forgettable trifle is fairly close to worthless.",
    "Vampires suck? That's a matter of opinion. But here's what inarguably, unequivocally does suck: Vampires Suck.",
    "Smart money says Friedberg and Seltzer never sit through these movies in entirety.",
    "You want vampiric satire with actual laughs? Try Mel Brooks' \"Dracula: Dead and Loving It,\" \"Love at First Bite,\" or even Roman Polanski's \"The Fearless Vampire Killers.\" Anything is better than Friedberg and Seltzer's endless, bargain-basement, sub-Cracked magazine un-comedy.",
    "It's a sloppy, tossed-off collection of parodic gags of vampire flicks and gratuitous pop-cultural references (oh, there will be pointless Lady Gaga gags!) that are below bottom-of-the-barrel."

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nWhen discussing movies with friends, we tend to be on polar opposites of things. They prefer fluff and stuff that big studios throw out of their faces with little thought, that's briefly entertaining and normally only high quality 10% of the time. So, when deciding what movies to go see with them tends to be an argument.  How they talked me into watching Vampires Suck is beyond me.I've Seen Epic Movie, and that was bad. I then reluctantly saw Disaster Movie. As every other critic said, that was exactly what the title said. So, seeing another Friedberg-Seltzer movie was not foreseen in my future. While normally when I'd see movies with friends, even If I knew they'd be awful, I'd stick it out for them. I tried to do so here, but it was near impossible. I couldn't think of many things good at all about the hurricane ravaged town of a movie I sat through.Nearly all the gags fell flat for me, whether it be the same old \"Reference something famous to get a laugh\" shtick or new attempts by the duo at simple gags (Like an unfunny cactus gag). I laughed about once during the movie, and that's when the guy in the wheelchair got beaten up (Ironic, as I was the only one laughing and I was the one in the wheelchair).Even what could have been nice saving graces, Ken Jeong of the Opus called Community and Diedrich Bader (An abused, guilty pleasure favorite comic of mine) did nothing important to save the film. The only thing that saved this steaming pile of awful was progress for the two directors. After being literally mentally assaulted by the stupidity of Disaster Movie trying to be funny, Vampires seemed to be less lazy, as they genuinely seemed to try to entertain the audience.But then again, maybe I'm not the one this movie is aimed for. My friends enjoyed it, taking it as stupid humor (I prefer my stupid humor smarter, which is a little bit of an oxymoron, from movies like the underrated Hot Rod)...and if you enjoy blatant pop culture references and lame gags...you may have found your movie.",

As a result, it manages to be better than the previous efforts by the movie-making team to date. However, that certainly doesn't mean that it is good by any stretch. Friedberg and Seltzer still fail to understand how to make the comedy work and instead populate their spoof with dated pop culture references, cheap toilet humor, obvious jokes and a few examples of horribly bad miscasting. There are many potential jokes to be had with source material like this to riff on but the script instead harps on the same things again and again which results in an irritatingly one-note spoof that fails far off the mark. This may not be Meet the Spartans level of bad, but as you might have guessed it's certainly not worth your time.",

In \"Eclipse\", the bedsprings go untested, as Bella listens to Edward prattle on about chaperoned strolls and iced tea on the porch, in which the vampire's antiquated notions regarding courtship, for my money, is far funnier than any of the comic bits that spoofs the insanely successful \"Twilight\" films; the \"Star Wars\" for girls. When Mel Brooks satirized the legendary space opera trilogy back in 1987, some people wondered if \"Spaceballs\" arrived too late. Relevance is obviously not an issue here. With \"Vampires Suck\", it's a matter of being too soon, since episodes four and five, so to speak, are both in their various states of gestation. Why couldn't the industry allow Stephanie Meyer's legions of fans the luxury of loving Bella and her fetish for interspecies guys a little while longer without having to desmysitfy the romance for them? Why make them feel stupid? Team Edward and Team Jacob, in the midst of breaking the fourth wall, fighting among themselves at the film's outset to reflect the pandemonium surrounding the fantastical men in Bella's charmed life, should break the wall further by converging on the filmmaker for making such a witless and insulting film. A glittering, pasty-faced vampire and an Indian afflicted with a serious case of werewolf gigantism are no laughing matters for the true believers. And even if you were against the team expansion of 2007(the release year for \"Twilight\"), when Edward and Jacob joined the filmic league of monsters, these lame ringers are no match as objects of ridicule when compared to the sight of Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner.",
