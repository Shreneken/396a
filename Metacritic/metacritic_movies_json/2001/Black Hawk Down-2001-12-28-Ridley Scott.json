    "summary": "Director Ridley Scott's adaptation of the true war story of the attack on a group of U.S. special forces sent into Somalia in 1993 to destabilize the government and bring food and humanitarian aid to the starving population.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "His is a triumph of pure filmmaking, a pitiless, unrelenting, no-excuses war movie so thoroughly convincing it's frequently difficult to believe it is a staged re-creation.",
        "It is an exceptional accomplishment.",
        "Black Hawk turns nightmare into great cinema.",
        "Doesn't just kick your ass. It pummels your entire body; it leaves you trembling.",
        "Scott superbly re-creates the sense of individuals facing astounding odds, with barely a few minutes' respite over a 12-hour battle.",
        "Films like this are more useful than gung-ho capers like \"Behind Enemy Lines.\" They help audiences understand and sympathize with the actual experiences of combat troops, instead of trivializing them into entertainments.",
        "Rivets our interest for its entire lengthy running time. And it does this without any of the usual war movie clich\u00e9s, false heroics, barracks-humor nonsense or grandstanding absurdities.",
        "A personal best for producer Jerry Bruckheimer, a triumph for Scott and a war film of prodigious power. You will be shaken.",
        "The next worst thing to being there. That's how real it feels.",
        "Absolutely harrowing, shocking in its sudden revelatory immediacy, and very, very well done, Black Hawk Down is one of the best depictions of the outright lunacy inherent to battle I have ever seen.",
        "One hell of a ride. For better or for worse, it will leave you stunned and reeling.",
        "What we need to remember, what Black Hawk Down reminds us, is that there are no safe missions when you're chasing bad guys. Especially when you have to chase them down a hole.",
        "It's one of the most ferociously convincing physical re-creations of warfare ever put on screen.",
        "You're drawn in, like it or not. You can't get away from the immediacy. Or the feeling that you're getting sucked in, too.",
        "Though passionate, doesn't pity or flatter the rank and file.",
        "Black Hawk Down, in the end, is a docudrama. But it's sensationally well done, and it opens up a battlefield that needed to be documented.",
        "A beautifully filmed, scrupulously authentic but strangely evasive exercise in combat ultra-realism.",
        "Even an audience moved to tender patriotism might wonder how Scott, a proven master of ''Gladiator''-size visual showmanship, could have bombed away the personality of every man fighting until he's left with nothing more than pure combat.",
        "In the end, neither the appealing cast -- nor the force of Scott's stunning imagery is enough to make us understand why these men died.",
        "No doubt captures some of the horror and the chaos of the actual situation, but it makes for a loud, often confusing, and always bloody two and a half hours.",
        "An endless battle scene in search of a movie. It's every bit as harrowing -- and also every bit as pointless and misguided -- as the botched military mission it depicts.",
        "It\u2019s a true endurance test, far too grim to be considered exciting, but not really informative enough to enlighten us about the effect of our presence in Somalia in 1993.",
        "Goes down like stiff medicine, leaving one feeling exhausted relief when it's finally over.",
        "Sitting through the accomplished but meaningless Black Hawk Down is like being trapped in an action film version of \"Groundhog Day,\" condemned to sit through the same carnage over and over.",
        "It's a Jerry Bruckheimer art film, perhaps the most extravagantly aestheticized combat movie ever made.",
        "Perhaps they truly believe war is an inescapable aspect of human life. If so, why make movies that rub our faces in its horror? If artists have no antidote to war's evil or insight into the suffering it brings, their motive in depicting it must be merely to sensationalize its terrors and make money from the morbid fascination it holds for audiences. We deserve better."

Set in Somalia, a group of soldiers are sent in on a peacekeeping operation. However, it all goes wrong and the chopper is shot down, leaving them stranded in the middle of a village with angry hostile soldiers and civilians. Other choppers are sent in for backup, and chaos breaks loose. Lot's of violence, blood and guts. Great characters, and played tremendously well by the actors. Black Hawk down is a great war movie. The plot is a bit basic and shaky, but it is a great movie nevertheless and one I recommend to any war movie fan.",

I, however, knew about this particular battle before watching the movie gave me a new perspective on the battle. It was a very depressing and horrid event, but I am glad to say that this movie is very good and you can watch it free on Netflix now so why not watch it? Anyways, I can gladly say that movie has aged well and is still a pleasure to watch. I really do feel the emotions and hardship the troops went through. The key players in this are the U.S. Special Forces (160th SOAR, Delta Force, and the 75th Rangers) and Mohamed Farrah Aidid and his militia, who by the way, are blocking the food/medicine supplies as their weapon. So the US Special Forces are sent in after an attack on UN and Pakistani troops. The movie is all about the title \"Black Hawk Down\" for those of you who don't know a Black Hawk is a military helicopter. A helicopter crashes and ground troops and helicopters are reverted to go back to the crash site to get back the survivors and equipment. Anyways, now that you know the plot, the movie acts this out very well and I think the SFX were brilliant for their age. I also loved the cast of characters and their role in the movie, they all seem connected. I love military movies and documentaries, so this review may be a bit biased. BUT, compared to the other horrible military movies out there this is a must watch for anyone, really.",

Based on journalist Mark Bowden\u2019s bestselling account of the 1993 fiascoWar is hell for 100 continuous minutes of screen time in \u201cBlack Hawk Down,\u201d a relentless immersion in combat strikingly realized but none too pleasurable to sit through. Based on journalist Mark Bowden\u2019s bestselling account of the 1993 fiasco on the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia, which left 18 American soldiers dead and more than 70 badly injured, this grim piece of work forcefully puts the viewer in the middle of the action in a harrowing way. But it crucially lacks almost everything but fighting, most particularly characterization, making Ridley Scott\u2019s second picture this year, after \u201cHannibal,\u201d almost entirely about logistics. Very well judged in its philosophical stance toward the material, this collaboration between Revolution Studios and Jerry Bruckheimer at Sony goes down like stiff medicine, leaving one feeling exhausted relief when it\u2019s finally over. War film buffs and Scott fans will turn out, but general audiences, and women in particular, will approach with extreme caution.\r Of the war films that have come out since \u201cSaving Private Ryan,\u201d \u201cBlack Hawk Down\u201d most closely resembles \u201cEnemy at the Gates,\u201d about the siege of Stalingrad, in that both are cold accounts of remorseless urban warfare marked by constant sniping in abjectly squalid settings. The new film\u2019s protracted detailing of door-by-door, block-by-block fighting may also remind viewers of portions of \u201cBand of Brothers,\u201d but that comparison only serves to underscore the present feature\u2019s shortcomings, in that the epic HBO series was able to develop interesting characters in the service of dramatic involvement and tension, elements conspicuously missing here.\r Unfortunately, it also refrains from giving you anything to feel other than general revulsion for war. Token attempts are made to differentiate the Delta Force, the aristocrats of U.S. military, from the only somewhat less exalted Task Force Rangers, but with their buzz cuts, buff bods and similar ways of talking, it\u2019s not easy to tell the soldiers apart, nor is one encouraged to think that it\u2019s going to be worth the effort, given how little attention Scott and the script give to the matter.\r Perhaps receiving marginally more screen time than most of the others is Staff Sgt. Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett), who is unexpectedly put in command of one of the \u201cchalks\u201d that will secure the area around the Mogadishu building being raided by the Deltas. Also standing out from the pack from time to time are Ranger Lt. Col. Danny McKnight (Tom Sizemore), a fearless older soldier who comes across as a more human version of Robert Duvall\u2019s Kilgore in \u201cApocalypse Now;\u201d Delta Sgt. First Class Jeff Sanderson (William Fichtner), a resourceful pro; and Ranger Spec. Grimes (Ewan McGregor), a desk man who finally gets his shot at combat.\r After a half-hour of preliminaries, Operation \u201cIrene\u201d begins, and the sight of 19 helicopters buzzing over the desert beaches toward the bleached-white city in the afternoon sun is stunning to behold. The 160 men, some of whom arrive on 12 Humvees and trucks, expect to be in and out within an hour and, indeed, it takes only 20 minutes for the Deltas to land, assault the building and take the two \u201cTier One\u201d targets and numerous other prisoners.\r A solid hour consists of little but constant shooting and shouted dialogue, making it tough to engage with characters you barely know. It may well have been Scott\u2019s aim to keep the men basically anonymous and interchangeable \u2014 to further the point that this is what war is, that it has always been thus and always will be. And while the specific historical setting of Mogadishu is stunningly evoked via an amazing blend of location shooting, mostly in the city of Sale, Morocco, near Rabat, and on production designer Arthur Max\u2019s utterly realistic sets, there is a simultaneous generalized feeling to the action that makes the film an expression of resignation over humankind\u2019s need to play out these fatal scenarios over and over.\r Perhaps at somewhat shorter length these points could have been made more effectively, but the pummeling viewers get \u2014 which can be rationalized intellectually as \u201cputting them through\u201d the firefight as vividly as possible \u2014 makes the film more rewarding to think about afterward than to actually experience. Pic will have a decidedly limited pool of repeat viewers.\r However, Hans Zimmer\u2019s score effectively juggles numerous different modes, from World Music sounds and choral work to source material.",

The film tries to portray the facts, but I do not know how faithful itThis film is based on an actual US military operation that went wrong and left several US military personnel surrounded by hostile forces in the Somali capital, Mogadishu. The film tries to portray the facts, but I do not know how faithful it was to them. Its likely that much of it has been subverted to emphasize the dramatic effect. It's a war movie, so it's full of intense fighting and fighting scenes. They are the strongest part of the movie, and were truly well made. Through these scenes, its very easy for the public to move to the scene and fight alongside the gi's.The major problem with this film is its inability to convey the lesson learned by the Americans in Somalia. The lesson is that America can not be the police of the world, and that it should not interfere in the internal problems of other countries lightly, as it did in Somalia (and other countries, usually with the worst consequences). The film never reflects on this either on the bad consequences of war, or from ill-thought military operations. It's just an excuse for a war movie with Americans dying and killing enemies like sparrows, which removes the film from any depth or meaning. If you had chosen to think about it, it could easily be compared to an \"Apocalypse Now\", for example. This iconic film speaks not only of the Vietnam War but also of how war affects all, winners and losers, for the worse. There is a profound message behind this film. There is no such thing here. It is a war movie that justifies itself, and loses quality with it. The film does not even dare to show the failure that was truly the American intervention in Somalia. At this point, it is simply advertisement. It is a propaganda piece to the heroism and blind patriotism of the Americans.The cast plays a fairly reasonable role, but with a script condemned at the start and highly partial, we can not expect miracles. The characters are very poorly developed, to the point that the public quickly loses the notion of who is who in the ray of the film. Losing that feeling is halfway to losing interest in what is happening. But as I said, the movie's strong point is action, and everything else was kind of relegated to the background by the production team. It's a good looking action movie or a movie that attempts to show real military combat. But compared to other war films, it's pretty primary, it gets boring and confusing, it does not appeal to everyone and it's easily forgettable.",
