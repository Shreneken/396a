    "critic_reviews": [
        "Like gathering storm clouds, Donnie Darko creates an atmosphere of eerie calm and mounting menace -- stands as one of the most exceptional movies of 2001.",
        "Kelly, the 26-year-old writer-director of this excitingly original indie vision, shares more artistically with Wes Anderson or Paul Thomas Anderson than he does with Spielberg or John Hughes, but the point is, he's out on his own here. He swings big -- with flair.",
        "It is funny, sad and beautiful. And it's right on time.",
        "Appealingly, the movie has a certain lightness -- like the aforementioned butterfly -- which makes its foreboding qualities surprisingly user-friendly.",
        "David Lynch lite.",
        "Kelly is a supple and courageous storyteller, boldly free-associating as he mixes parody and satire with earnest psychodrama and coming up with plot points no one could anticipate.",
        "If you let it be what it is, Donnie Darko will knock you flat.",
        "A stunning technical accomplishment that virtually bursts with noise, ideas and references, but it's fundamentally a gracefully crafted movie that's about human beings and not images.",
        "So much here is equally befuddling and beguiling; I caught myself leaning in toward the screen repeatedly, trying to somehow get closer to the gorgeous impenetrability of the story, of the boy.",
        "Most experienced filmmakers wouldn't even attempt a film that's so blackly funny, that so rapidly shifts genres and tone, and that layers late '80s cultural references so thickly, from \"E.T.\" to Smurfs.",
        "Its only constant is that it's strangely eloquent and quite original.",
        "Has plenty of problems. But most stem from a young filmmaker overswinging on his first time up to the plate and hitting a deep fly out rather than a home run.",
        "Has plenty of problems. But most stem from a young filmmaker overswinging on his first time up to the plate and hitting a deep fly out rather than a home run.",
        "Donnie Darko is the one that got away. But it was fun trying to land it.",
        "The flaws are more than balanced out by the risks the earnest Kelly encourages his excellent cast to take.",
        "If this movie ever figured out what it wanted to be when it grows up, it would be a terrific one.",
        "It's this compulsion to solder melancholy to weightlessness that constantly trips up the movie; Mr. Kelly doesn't have the assurance to pull off such a difficult feat.",
        "This is really one of those Rorschach test films. You either love it or hate it. For those who loved it, I have only one word: overrated.",
        "Just another self-absorbed teen chronicle, with the added twist of a little time travel and a surprise ending."

The director should just stick with what he actually understands, rather than pretend like he knows how wormholes and dimensions work. Also, if the audience requires online discussions in order to understand just a portion of a movie's meaning, then that's a clear sign of an unsatisfactory movie with very poor writing and execution. This movie is one of the best examples of that. It should've been able to stand on its own without much outside research. Overall, the movie is edgy, pretentious, confusing, nonsensical, filled with pseudoscience, and struggles to give any sort of clarity in its messages. On top of that, it's really really boring..",

It expounds an eerie, mystical atmosphere that inculcate fear and evoke philosophical contemplation in audiences, proving its incredible intellectual nature.

However, it is possible to list all of the things it achieves in it's 2 hour run time. It's funny without losing it's grim tone, it's a physiological thriller that blends themes of time travel and isolation into a coherent plot, and it is an drama so well portrayed that even the most illogical components of this tale are believable in its world.\rThe main character, Donnie, is a teenager with schizophrenia who is met by a human wearing a demonic-rabbit Halloween costume. This rabbit tells him that the world is too end in 28 days, due to a part of the world that Donnie was closest to collapsing. Donnie is the only one that can save the universe, as he was the primary receiver to the event that is threatening to destroy the universe. I won't say what the event is as it would partially ruin its unravelling throughout the film. This sets up what is to be a fascinatingly complex thriller.\rDonnie's character is an mysterious oddity for much of the film, yet he still manages to be sympathetic enough for you to side with him in this mind bending story. 'Darko' deals with very advanced subject matter without being up its own arse, as well as dealing with ideas of remoteness and even young love without becoming preachy.\rIt will leave you saddened yet satisfied, as the ending is so well wrapped up. Everything about this film is wonderful. This may sound clich\u00e9, but it remains a must see, even 13 years on from its release.",

Every time I thought I had it figured out, it would throw an absolute curve ball at me.  I like movies to leave me guessing a little bit at the end, but this one left way too much unexplained, and I'm not even talking about the \"how\" questions, but more of the \"why\" for some of the characters' motivations.  Maybe the extended cut sheds some light on those aspects.  As it is, I really liked it, but too many questions keep it from a perfect score.  I give it a B, next time you\u2019re in the mood for a movie, this one won\u2019t disappoint.",

Donnie Darko is a wonderful film, full of suspense, motion, and a constantly intriguing, if not unsettling mood. However, it\u2019s plagued with two problems: it\u2019s too ambitious, and it never stops to give the audience time to collect its thoughts.\rFirstly, the ambition. It appears that director Richard Kelly had a lot on his mind for this story. Filmmaking is an art that cthat cthat cannot be done without vast imagination and a spinning mind. Unfortunately, Kelly\u2019s ambition got the best of him. The result is an overly-thrilling roller coaster ride that simultaneously intrigues and disorients its riders. Even the \u201cresolution\u201d at the end with Frank the rabbit (a character I personally like) and the storm of the tangent universe couldn\u2019t clean up the mess that was Donnie Darko\u2019s plotline.\rA bigger problem with the film was its rushing speed. There was never one moment where Donnie stopped to explain to the audience what exactly was going on (one of his therapy sessions could have done this seamlessly). Instead, we are given sporadic (and untimely) ten-second excerpts from a woman\u2019s philosophical discoveries in time travel. Again, this results in a disorienting roller coaster ride that would be a lot more fun if Kelly had taken a moment to decelerate and catch the audience up on the twisting plotline.\rIn conclusion, this is what I have to say: the film had a very interesting premise, a fascinatingly somber ambiance, and some wildly good moments of suspense and filmmaking genius (most of which involved Frank and/or sleepwalking). Sadly, its ultimate potential was not met, and what could have been one of the best films of the year turned out instead to be a flurry of ambitious ideas riddled with sci-fi fancies and schizophrenic attacks.\r FINAL SCORE: 65 (a neat watch ----------o---------- pretty good)",

I found Amelie by the end more irritating than cute, I didn't laugh once at Rushmore, and only a hostage situation could coerce me to watch The Piano again.\r Donnie Darko has a large legion of fans and I certainly understand its appeal. The acting by both Jake Gyllenhaal and Drew Barrymore is some of their best work. The rest of the cast also shines with a special kudos to Holmes Osborne as the father in what is almost always a throw away role.\r The school and kids remind me of my high school from the eighties (Though this being Hollywood the music is much better than what the radio actually played in those years.) and the filmmakers certainly know how to frame a shot. I was even able to look past the Holden Caulfield and Harvey flashbacks the movie caused me to suffer.\r So what went wrong\u2026 the plot. Oh up until the payoff it's fine enough, in fact it is better than fine. One wonders how the filmmakers are going to pull it off. The answer is simple. They don't. If anything the end of the movie reminded me of that atrocious horror film from a few years back Soul Survivors. Like Soul Survivors the movie holds your interest with more and more implausible plot twists and coincidences then cheats at the end like a bad junior high school English essay.\r Now Donnie Darko is otherwise superior to Soul Survivors and other films where the ending is a groaner (cough The Village cough), but after all that goodness the magic is gone and they couldn't pull a rabbit out of their hat.

Donnie demonstrates to people not yet manifested a weak sense of generosity. Remember it well, and this word. GENEROSITY '. \"Helping hand.\"\rHe does not like the hypocrites bigoted Puritans.\rHis intelligence, often called into question, constantly collides with who teaches and disseminates ideas about life that have nothing to do with the pain inherent in the same. Fleeting happiness.\r3. We meet often with Frank, which will prove to be ....\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\"Viaduct relationship\"\r These meetings will take Donnie to create arbitrary behavior considered, controversial, reprehensible.\rSo it is?\rLife choices, the resulting suffering, acts of daily life, the pathos of Donnie; everything stems from decisions or induced?\rBecause, even if re-considered by friends, he continues to maintain its aura of introverted, taciturn, reserved?\r\n4. October 10, 1988. Donnie queries its physics professor.

October 18, 1988. A new character enters the scene is Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze). Gab, purpose of his seminar is to alienate the children from the fears, defeat them. Drugs, alcohol and adolescent problems are his favorite subjects. But\u2026.

They are pervaded by the \"newspaper\" and that's enough for them to live a life \"happy\". When Donnie tries to deepen \"with professionals in the know\" some issues about the purpose of life or the existence, receives only traces of knowledge. And any kind of pedagogical mediation.\r\n\r\nAnd 'her CAPACITY' REFLECTIVE that allows it to:\r\n\r\nfocus your attention on a particular situation;\r\ndevelop ideas that seeks to order;\r\nachieve a goal;\r\nAll this is not possible if you are not in a position to know how to research, investigate and then sort them into logical sequences; seriously consider all that may sound belief;\r\nI do not think that Donnie a \"psychiatric illness.\" I mean, for me the \"workings of his mind,\" her cognitive namely: perception, learning, problem solving, memory, attention, language, emotions, has a coefficient very high, far above his peers and hardly perceptible by adults. \"The most\" difficult \"students are entitled to have the best teachers.\" I believe this maxim EXTRAORDINARY. E 'succeeded despite the ......... of events to transform his suffering, his trouble, in a situation emotionally soothing, quiet, and why not harmonious. Everything fits together perfectly.\r\nThe neurosciences have a duty to give meaning to the lives of patients, who struggle to see SE themselves projected into a future that has a meaning, not only; and possibly full of hope.\r\n\r\n8. In here, I can only mention the text by Roberta Ann Sparrow \"The philosophy of the trips in the time.\"\r\n\r\nContent:\r\n\r\nPremise\r\nThe Tangent Universe\r\nWater and Metal\r\nThe Artifact and the Living\r\nThe Living Receiver\r\nThe Manipulated Living\r\nThe Manipulated Dead\r\ndreams\r\nappendix\r\n\r\nMore I can not for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n9. \"Wormhole\" or \"of\" Einstein-Rosen Bridge \".\r\n\r\nWhich train is faster, that of Theoretical Physics or that of Sci?\r\n\r\n1905, Albert Einstein published a study on the compatibility between mechanics and electromagnetism. (Or special theory of relativity);\r\n1915, Albert Einstein published a further work on relativity (theory of general relativity);\r\nThe space-time or chronotope is a four-dimensional space, that is, 3-dimensional space and time as a coordinated addition. So no more distinction between space and time. The observer has to radically change his way of seeing and thinking (vision and static thought). In different situations and conditions the concept of forward - behind; right left; high Low; changes.\r\nThe Einstein-Rosen bridge is a short street, a short path, which allows to reach a different universe in less time. Also called wormholes - \"worm hole\", is also called tunnel space - time; of tarla tunnel or burrow of worm. This \"hole\" allows you to travel and to exceed the speed of light.\r\nTake two small funnels, add them through the spout, place them vertically, and you've got a fantastic and wonderful tunnel space - time. The WORMHOLE.\r\nMy job ends here. The huge amount of scientific data that can be processed deserve well other professionals. I'm not.\r\nI hope to have intrigued the reader and this is enough for me. The insights are dependent variables.

A main character that had a personality and mannerisms that were just\u2026 so different from any movie archetype that he seemed like a real person. I understand why this is considered a cult movie due to the subject being about something I believe we can all relate to and it ending up being life-altering. The notion that those \"flashes\" of the future, those predictive \"dreams\" we have sometimes, those key words that catch our attention more than others\u2026.  Maybe they are more than just that. It\u2019s a nice thinking movie, but that dark and foreboding music (especially in the credits) makes me want to think there is something more. Thinking back before something tragic happened to you, do you remember any sign? Can the strange feeling in your gut be the power of fate?",
