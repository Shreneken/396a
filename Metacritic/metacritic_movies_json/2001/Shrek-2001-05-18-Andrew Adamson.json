  "summary": "Once upon a time in a far away swamp, there lived an ornery ogre named Shrek (Myers) whose precious solitude is suddenly shattered by an invasion of annoying fairy-tale characters.  (Dreamworks SKG)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "It's wondrous, it's fabulous, it's -- all but unprecedented.",
    "This is not your average family cartoon. Shrek is jolly and wicked, filled with sly in-jokes and yet somehow possessing a heart.",
    "A movie that appeals to the eye, mind, heart and funny bone; that's a pretty good quadruple for any movie.",
    "A riotous and wee bit PG-racy computer-animated family fable, is the most thoroughly enjoyable cartoon feature since \"Toy Story\" burst out of its box.",
    "An adorable, infectious work of true sophistication.",
    "An unqualified triumph.",
    "Lives happily ever after because it's such a feisty but good natured embrace of the inner ogre in everyone.",
    "Funny, irreverent and moving, the unconventional Shrek may mock fairy tales, but in the process, creates its own.",
    "The script, instead of being what we tolerate in order to savor the visuals, is a delight all by itself.",
    "A movie whose story may be even more innovative than the superreal solidity of the animated characters.",
    "A world-class charmer that could even seduce the Academy when it hands out the first official animation Oscar next year.",
    "This fractured fairy tale not only knows there's no substitute for clever writing, it also has the confidence to take that information straight to the bank.",
    "It's possible to groan, chuckle, wince and be moist-eyed, sometimes in a span of seven or eight minutes.",
    "The textures are detailed, the movements are realistic and the three-dimensional feel even improves on the humor -- you may think you've seen every good \"Matrix\" parody, but you haven't until you see this.",
    "Shrek's first 20 minutes are so devilishly funny that letting go of pure belief doesn't seem like such a bad thing.",
    "Colossally entertaining.",
    "A giggly cocktail, though it's more foam than drink.",
    "Charmingly subversive animation like this is a rare thing indeed, and the fact that you don't have to be under 10 years of age to thoroughly enjoy Mr. Shrek's wild ride is an added bonus.",
    "As innocent as a Disney movie -- and a lot more entertaining.",
    "While Shrek may trek into that dark territory and has some questionable values simmering beneath the surface, its characters are delightful enough and the film is just sweet-natured and visually sophiscated enough to avoid sinking into the swamp.",
    "The visuals are amazingly realistic, filling the screen with authentic effects.",
    "This spirited and often very funny lark accomplishes something that most films in the bygone Hollywood studio era used to do but is remarkably rare in today's world of niche markets: It offers entertainment equally to viewers from 4 to 104.",
    "Alternately sweet and mean, sophisticated and vulgar, witty and base, dazzling and ugly, charming and charmless.",
    "Am I alone in thinking that computer animation is the work of the antichrist?",
    "Desperately avoiding the risk of even a half-second of boredom, the movie is wall-to-window-to-door noise, babbling, and jokes.",
    "Shrek isn't clever or smart. It just wants you to think it is, through wink after wink after wink."

I can understand why. Shrek is pretty blatant with it's sexual innuendos and profanity. I wouldn't show it to really little kids either. Probably only the more discerning tweenagers and up.Shrek skewers fairy tale tropes with it's sarcastic sense of humor without ever straying too far away from them. The idea being to allow the outcasts to finally get their happily ever after ending while simultaneously giving a sullen middle finger to the beautiful people who almost have one handed to them. That's what works for me with Shrek. I'm an ugly guy who has always been judged for both my appearance and the fact that I don't act like everyone else does. This movie showed me a protagonist with similar qualities and allowed him to find friendship, true love, and grow as a person (Er... Ogre).And isn't that the point of fairy tales? To enchant listeners with stories where anyone downtrodden can have hope? Why is it then that most of the time only the 10/10 hotties have been able to get a happy ending?Shrek is an escapism fantasy for those who don't typically get to have one outside of what they imagine for themselves.",

Rudely sending up even the most beloved fairy tale traditions while at the same time effectively embodying them, this spirited and often very funny lark accomplishes something that most films in the bygone Hollywood studio era used to do but is remarkably rare in today’s world of niche markets: It offers entertainment equally to viewers from 4 to 104.\r Playing equally effectively as a lively romp for kids and an enormously clever comedy for adults, “Shrek” is both simple and sophisticated, hip without being smug or condescending. It’s also a film for animation fans to cherish as well as one that non-enthusiasts can enjoy. On May 12, pic will become just the fifth animated film to be shown in competition at the Cannes Film Festival, after the late ’40s-early ’50s Disney features “Make Mine Music,” “Dumbo” and “Peter Pan,” and the 1973 French production “La Planete Sauvage” (Fantastic Planet).\r Shaking the narrative and stylistic cobwebs from the form, standing every fairy tale convention on its head and landing some excellent shots at Disney for good measure, the picture scores on every front: The writing is smart, the vocal performances are game, and the relatively lifelike look is stunningly realized, making for the best-looking computer animated feature to date.\r Screenplay by the team of Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (“Aladdin,” “The Mark of Zorro”), Joe Stillman (“Beavis & Butt-head Do America”) and Roger S.H. Schulman (“Balto”) is based on a short 1990 illustrated children’s book by William Steig that chronicled in very simple terms a horrible ogre’s journey to a castle where he wins the hand of an equally ugly princess. There was nothing more to it than that, so it’s a conservative estimate to venture that at least 95% of the inspiration for what’s onscreen came from the scriptwriters, who have let their imaginations go in coming up with characters, subplots, relationships, gags, intrigues and flights of fancy that have no seeds in the book.\r Fine jokes and reversals of expectations fill the journey homeward, where the film most clearly reveals its charming small debts to such timeless classics as “Don Quixote,” “The Wizard of Oz” and “Beauty and the Beast,” among others. One of the funniest bits has Princess Fiona singing a Disney-style duet with a bluebird, until the chirping creature suddenly explodes when Fiona hits a piercing high note. Only false note in the entire picture comes when Fiona, accosted by a strangely French-accented “Monsieur” Robin Hood, makes some “Matrix”/”Crouching Tiger”-type martial arts moves; bit feels like a sop to tastes of the moment and is the element that will first appear to date the film in years to come.\r Visually, “Shrek” is a constant dazzlement, the images all but leaping off the screen. Against the brilliantly designed, exceptionally vivid backgrounds, the characters, human and animal alike, appear realistic and highly expressive without being photographically so; the fine line between naturalism and stylization has been unerringly walked by the large team working under first-time directors Andrew Adamson (a veteran visual effects supervisor) and Vicky Jenson (an art director and storyboard artist).\r Endowing Shrek with a mild Irish brogue, Myers brings abundant drollery and vocal appeal to the physically repugnant title character, which implicitly lends weight to the underlying theme of beauty coming from the inside. Much as he did in his previous animated outing as Mushu the Dragon in “Mulan,” Murphy provides Donkey with a jive-talking motor mouth; some of his riffs are genuinely amusing, but the routine threatens to become a bit much at times. Diaz’s readings are energetic and willful, making Fiona a medieval “Charlie’s Angels” candidate, and Lithgow makes the vertically shortchanged Farquaad imposing without undue melodrama.\r Outstanding score by Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell (“Antz,” “Chicken Run”) is abetted by a collection of eclectic, shrewdly chosen pop tunes all used to lively effect.",

Every single movie those two companies made were great and I loved every single one of them except Dreamworks's huge disappointments like \"Shark Tale\" and \"Bee Movie\" even though they weren't the worst movies ever made. By far, my favorite Dreamworks Animated movie is none other than \"Shrek\" loosely based on the book by William Steig. It tells the story about Shrek, a peace loving ogre who is desperate to save his swamp (along with help from a talkative donkey named, well, Donkey) that has been taken over by the fairy tale creatures sent by Lord Farquaad. He makes a deal that if Shrek rescues Princess Fiona, he'll give him his swamp back. I can't spoil the rest only to those who haven't seen it.Everything about this movie is magnificent. The story was very original due to Dreamworks's earlier entries. The characters were great/funny. Donkey was by far the most hilarious fairy tale character I have ever seen and Shrek had a couple of funny lines. The voice acting for the characters were absolutely perfect and they gave their successful talents for this movie. The computer animation is stunningly amazing with very rich colorful backgrounds and striking visuals. The pop culture jokes were very funny I loved every single one of them. The music from Harry Gregson Williams and John Powell was beautiful with some very emotional melodies including the song \"It Is You I Have Loved\" sung by Dana Glover was lovely.Shrek is Dreamworks Animation's strongest animated adventure comedy which was intended for its younger audiences and it is suitable for kids ages +8-12. A solid thumbs from me :)",

It's as if someone in Marketing said: let's make a film that will appeal to all ages- it will be a mix of \"the Princess Bride\" and \"broadway's Into the Woods,\" but 3D ANIMATED. Then we'll make it hip by adding a few pop hits, and we'll get famous voices and make everyone tell sick jokes! Then we can call Burger King and have them make green slurpees and apple jelly dip! wow. It'll be great. And all you sick weirdos out there fell for it. This green piece won't be remembered for too long, take my word for it. Really, everybody thought the marky mark Planet of the Apes was great when it came out..and look what happened to that.",

I mean, from the very start of this film you are giggling and at the end you would?ve bust a gut laughing. The comedy is all jolly, wicked and brilliant, but the romance is also something to be treasured. Even though these are just animated characters, they are the most realistic people-like creatures. The romance story is amazingly subtle and is one of the best things about this movie. Kudos to Eddie Murphy, Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow too for voicing these full-bodied characters. Eddie is a hilarious fast-talker, Mike?s Scottish accent rarely slips, and Cameron?s true-love-obsessed Princess Fiona is a treat for her and John just seems to be a very talented voice. Of course I could not go through this review without mentioning the outstanding visual value in which this film beholds. The characters all look incredibly life-like, the sets are stunning, the cinematography is beautiful and the CGI-style will never fail. Hats off to the bunch of directors who deserve more praise than they get. Directors are often over-looked in animated films but the directors behind Shrek do marvelously and hopefully people will take more notice. But, at the end of the day, Shrek?s script is its top spot. The script is crude, hilarious, clever, poignant, energetic, inventive and romantic. Shrek is a pitch-perfect good time at the flicks. An animated masterpiece, one of the best of its kind.",

It's just as funny, creative and entertaining as it ever was, and though more recent animated films have surpassed it in terms of quality of animation, it still looks good, and you have to wonder whether animation technology would have developed at the rate it has without this film. The voice cast are perfect - Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy as Shrek and Donkey put in their very best comic performances, and make the buddy movie element of the film work, Cameron Diaz's Fiona quite literally kicks the traditional fairytale idea of a damsel in distress in the face, and John Lithgow's Lord Farquaad is a brilliantly pantomime villain. Where Shrek really stands out in in expertise in the fine comedy art of parody. You can quite literally tick off the fairytales and films Shrek affectionately pokes fun at, and the film also has some quite astute things to say about commercialisation, celebrity and the modern media-centric world.

When comparing \"Shrek\" to its competitor at the Oscars, \"Monsters Inc.\", I was really disappointed it won, due to the qualities that \"Monsters Inc.\" posseses that \"Shrek\" doesn't. While \"Monsters Inc.\" mixes alot of humor, setting, and heart into its storytelling, \"Shrek\" puts alot of emphasis on humor than setting and heart. Yes, \"Shrek\" does have the ugly thing going for it, but it's put against to much humor to even tell it. \"Shrek\" may have been special for an animated film back then, because of its humor, but now, heart is what is really major in storytelling.\rWhile this review may seem negative, it's not. \"Shrek\" is hilarious if anything, and you will probably be laughing your socks off from Eddie Murphey's Donkey.",

It is a thrilling move filled with fun and action, and Shrek himself is a beautiful and charming man. Infact, I masturbate to him every night. And here it is: the essential plot twist of any detective movie  and yes, there is a certain gumshoe element here. Shrek falls in love with the princess he's been ordered to find. But we don't need to get into that too much. What counts in \"Shrek\" is the sideshow, whether it's the fluid, lifelike visuals or the slightly twisted humor.\r While kids can chortle at Farquaad torturing the Gingerbread Man in a protracted, cookie-crumbling scene (The horror, the horror!), grownups can smirk at jokes about Disneyland's character-named parking lots or laugh at the scene when Farquaad consults with the Magic Mirror for wifely candidates. Snow White, says the Mirror, is definitely possible. \"Although she lives with seven men,\" he tells Farquaad, \"she's not easy.\"\r The bread and butter of the movie, though, is the back-and-forth among the three main characters as they journey to Farquaad. Myers is inventively funny, as are Murphy, who's doing slightly badder variations on his \"Mulan\" character, Mushu, and Diaz, who makes a funny, earthy princess. There's a rather lovely romantic element at work, too, which hinges on the princess's closely held secret  and a positive message about inner beauty in the bargain. So, we have a movie that appeals to the eye, mind, heart and funny bone; that's a pretty good quadruple for any movie. It's certainly a bright first step for the summer.",

A movie that makes fun of all their tropes and staples while being also good enough to stand toe to toe with the best animated movies of all times. It was a huge financial success, had high acclaim of fans / critics and started a successful franchise. The humor is the greatest strength of the movie. Nothing is safe or sacred. Be it fairy tales, Disney movies, tropes or stereotypes. They used a lot of care and thoughts to create well written jokes. Many other parodies and spoof movies failed with flat jokes or a quantity over quality approach. Also they chose some of the best voice actors they could use. Mike Myers as Shrek, Eddie Murphy as Donkey, Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona and John Lithgow as Lord Farquaad. All together give an amazing performance and I think it is a benchmark for animated movies. Then there is the story with an unusual hero. Shrek is a green ogre and loves the solitude of his swap. He tries to scare away all intruders to be not further disturbed by angry villagers or knights that want to defeat monsters to prove them-self. Meanwhile Lord Farquaad wants to get rid of all fairy-tale creatures / magic beings and exiles them to Shreks swamp. Shrek is now on his journey to get them out of his swap (with their full moral support as they want not to be exiled there). So starts one of the most entertaining journeys in animated movies and a constant attack on your risible muscles. The animations were also pretty impressive back then. They used computer animations to great potential and we were amazed back then how good it looked. Later I read it was the most elaborate animated movie of all times back then. It is always amazing how technology improved. I think I have said all that is needed. Overall this was a remarkable movie and a must see. I think it deserved to be called a movie that earned its place in animated history.",

With its blend of high adventure, light romance, and double-layered dialogue (which will take on a slightly different meaning forDreamworks Pictures' wonderful, whimsical Shrek proves to be the latest family film to live up to its billing. With its blend of high adventure, light romance, and double-layered dialogue (which will take on a slightly different meaning for the under- and over-12 crowd), Shrek is capable of enthralling both children and their parents. In fact, this movie is so good that adults unaccompanied by offspring can venture into a theater without having to dress up in a disguise. Shrek is not a guilty pleasure for sophisticated movie-goers; it is, purely and simply, a pleasure.\r When it comes to computer-generated motion pictures, Shrek has once more raised the bar - and this one was already at an impressively high level in the wake of Toy Story 2 and Dinosaur. Yet Shrek outshines them both, boasting the most impressive detail and most amazingly rendered creatures of any motion picture in its class. And, although the human beings still don't look entirely realistic, they're getting close. In fact, this is the first major computer animated film in which human beings have had a significant role (they played secondary parts in the two Toy Storys), and their appearance is such that we have no more trouble accepting them than we do in traditional animated fare.\r Shrek is essentially Beauty and the Beast with a few clever twists. In the quirky, irreverent way that it views fairy tales and their conventions, it's not unlike The Princess Bride. Fans of those two stories will find much to like here. And, both kids and adults can play a game of \"guess how many famous faces we can see\". There are certainly a large number of cameos: Pinnochio (a \"possessed toy\"), Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Cinderella, the Big Bad Wolf, the Three Little Pigs, the Gingerbread Man, the Three Blind Mice, the Mirror (as in \"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all...\"), and many others.\r Many of Shrek's funniest lines (like \"a castle that big must mean he's compensating for something\") will go over younger viewer's heads, but there are still plenty that won't (\"I'm going to save my ass\", referring to Donkey). The screenplay was obviously written with all age groups in mind. Shrek is not on such a lofty plane that children will feel as if they're missing something, but it isn't lobotomized in a way that will insult the intelligence of older viewers.\r As impressive as the visuals are - and they are very impressive - Shrek wouldn't be the movie it is without a quartet of effective vocal performances. As this kind of animation becomes more prevalent, the importance of choosing the right voices will need equal care and attention. Voices help to define the characters, and a bad choice can do irreparable damage. Just as not all silent stars were suitable for talkie roles, so not all live-action actors can do vocal performances. Fortunately, Shrek has four capable actors. First and foremost is Mike Myers, who is known as a vocal chameleon. Without seeing his name in the opening credits, you'd never know it was him. John Lithgow plays Faquaad as nasty and short-sighted, but not really evil, which makes a pleasant change from the usual animated villain. Eddie Murphy shows that a real comic genius can get laughs without relying on his own facial expressions and body language. Murphy's Donkey is one of the funniest characters he has brought to the screen. (Here, he improves upon what he did in Mulan.) Finally, Cameron Diaz's princess is equal parts sugar and vinegar. She believes in true love and Prince Charming, but, like her Charlie's Angels alter-ego, she's not afraid to do a little Matrix-style butt kicking.\r The interplay between Shrek and Princess Fiona is sweet and tender, while the exchanges between the ogre and the ass are often barbed and subversively funny. Like The Princess Bride, Shrek breaks with convention, but not so far that viewers will be put off by it. And, while there is a happy ending (as there must be in any fairy tale, no matter how unconventional), it's not necessarily the conclusion that many people will be expecting (at least up until the 2/3 point, when the movie reveals its hand). First-time co-directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson (he has worked as a visual supervisor on other films, including the two Joel Schumacher Batmans; this is her first credit) have crafted a movie to be proud of, and one that will hopefully receive a lot of attention, even during the crowded summer season. Shrek is easily one of the year's most magical experiences.",

Based on a children's book by William Steig, the film represents a new peak in computer animation from PDI/ DreamWorks — the folks who brought you Antz. But this time they've added humans to the mix. Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers with the same Scottish burr he gave Fat Bastard in the last Austin Powers flick, is a big, green, stinking ogre who sticks close to his home in the swamps to avoid people who call him a big, green, stinking ogre. But then the badass Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow), a three-foot-tall bully with a giant ego, demands that Shrek rescue Farquaad's feisty intended, Princess Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz), from a fire-breathing lady dragon who has her mojo going for Shrek's pal Donkey (brayed to comic perfection by Eddie Murphy). Insiders will tell you that Farquaad is DreamWorks chief Jeffrey Katzenberg's revenge on his former Disney boss Michael Eisner. What, just because Farquaad's kingdom is a theme park with turnstiles and his subjects include Pinocchio, Cinderella and Snow White? Forget the in-jokes, the moral messages about beauty being skin-deep (No! Really?) and the rock soundtrack. By the time Smash Mouth sing the Monkees' hit \"I'm a Believer,\" you'll be a believer, too. What matters about Shrek is the wonder of the photorealistic animation — only God can make a tree, but a million digital polygons come damn close — the humor of the storytelling and the way the characters touch your heart without making you puke. Cannes judges might blanch at the product tie-ins (green ketchup from Heinz — puh-leese!), but Shrek is a world-class charmer that could even seduce the Academy when it hands out the first official animation Oscar next year. A hermit hero whose farts kill fish, the first smart ass to talk onscreen since Ace Ventura, a hidden dragon of a princess who sings off-key and a villain based on Disney's CEO — what's not to like?",
