  ],
  "summary": "Guy Ritchie's highly anticipated comedy features a colorful ensemble cast in a rollicking ride through London's gangster world, its bustling diamond district and a rowdy gypsy camp.  (Columbia Tristar)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Snatch is nothing if not watchable: It has the insane, popcorn rhythms of a Road Runner cartoon, and for that reason alone it's a minor masterpiece.",
    "Ritchie's got something all his own: a go-for-broke energy that cuts through the cliches of the crime genre.",
    "The convoluted story is an excuse for comical tricks of the camera, fractures of chronology, acid punch lines and amusingly excessive performances. (In this latter category, Pitt, so deep into his character that you can smell him, wins the day gloriously.)",
    "Snatch is admittedly superficial, if not downright disposable. More importantly, though, the movie is also fantastic, cheeky fun.",
    "Another whirling crime caper that leaves you shocked and chuckling at the same time.",
    "Even if it's not quite as lighter than air as its predecessor, Snatch remains a lethal diversion.",
    "It's possible that Ritchie's most important asset is the comic constant within his characters' existential dilemmas. To a man (and, indeed, they're all men), Ritchie's anti-heroes are at odds, in either large or small ways, with their own natures.",
    "Although the plot is crucial, it's the interaction among characters that makes Snatch percolate. Ritchie knows when to stop and smell the comedy.",
    "Though far from a sophomore slump, Snatch, like \"Smoking Barrels,\" is such a grab bag of other influences that it's tough to figure out what, if anything, about Ritchie's style is uniquely his own.",
    "Belongs to that distinctly '90s genre of sadistic crime comedy whose time has clearly come and gone.",
    "The movie was snatched, all right, and Ritchie is the culprit.",
    "Since the main reason I go to movies is to engage with characters, I prefer \"The Pledge,\" the film opening today by Madonna's first husband, Sean Penn, rather than this stylish fluff by her second spouse.",
    "If the film is too similar to Ritchie's first movie, \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" with its multiple story lines, complex plotting, and double-crossing antics, it's at least colorfully told with dialogue that shines with the inventive slang of Ritchie's screenplay.",
    "It all feels rather laddish and belabored, but it will eat up 90 minutes of your time without making you regret the loss.",
    "Mr. Ritchie seems to be stepping backward when he should be moving ahead.",
    "Guy Ritchie's second feature, is a faux tough caper modeled lock, stock, kit, and caboodle on his earlier film ''Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.''",
    "More isn't always better; everything feels slightly forced, and the funny bits -- make no mistake, there are several -- are all but lost in the noise.",
    "Follows the \"Lock, Stock\" formula so slavishly it could be like a new arrangement of the same song.",
    "There's talent here, but for directing, not writing. If Ritchie wants to last, he's going to have to allow somebody else to write his screenplays.",
    "The problem with all this don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-it dramaturgy is that ultimately everything is sacrificed for effect. When you're dealing, as Ritchie is, with explosions of real violence and viciousness, the hyperslick technique can't accommodate the real pain that comes with the territory, or ought to. What we're left with is a cackling amorality -- not a philosophy of life, just a posture.",
    "Ritchie may be skilled at generating controlled chaos, but his surprise-a-minute strategy ultimately holds no surprises; Snatch is even more frenetically boring than his 1999 \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.\"",
    "Emits the embarrassing aura of a filmmaker desperate to be considered cool, yet utterly inept at finding original ways to reach that status.",
    "It takes a very clever schoolboy to make a movie as elaborately empty as Guy Ritchie's Snatch.",
    "For those who care, Madonna has found her match in Guy Ritchie, whose absence of talent when it comes to the film medium is equal to her own."

Too many people say that it has no plot, and though there is very little of it, it is still their. However it is witty, funny, action packed and is just filled with awesome. A minor masterpiece. Jason Statham is very funny and is a strong character. I hoped to see more of him in this movie but sadly not. Brad Pitt showed his best acting to date (2011). He manages to keep a thick incomprehensible irish accent throughout. The scene where his mother dies in the caravan had me devastated. This movie really showed the potential he has. Lots of people say that all the characters are similar, but only one thing about them is similar. They all live a life of crime. To say that Boris the Blade (or Bullet dodger) is similar to Tom or Bullettooth is madness. The ending truly makes one joyful that it ended as it did. Looking forward to see Lock, Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels, haven't seen it yet.",

Rest assured that your potential for gaining new insight or finding life-enriching meaning of any kind is slim to none; you definitely will not be uplifted. Even just measuring it in terms of simple entertainment value, its wit  humor don't come close to compensating for its violence. The kinds of flashy bloodshed and theatrical cruelty which are found in films like Snatch desensitize fragile minds and corrode morals in a way that, yes, does in fact facilitate real-world violence. Brief example: the film's analysis of the efficiencies of pig farms for human corpse disposal  some people inevitably walked away reflecting on the strengths  weaknesses of different corpse disposal methods...a topic in which they would not have otherwise invested mental energy. I just wish we could have more honest conversations with ourselves and each other about the impact the media to which we expose ourselves has on us individually, and on those among us who are most malleable. Not to be preachy, but that there is any real market for this movie ought to be unsettling to those of us who value human life; this film almost entirely implies that it is worthless.

It had a bigger budget, so it looks a whole lot better than that movie, and it has a more experienced cast, too, so the performances were a lot more convincing. Dennis Farina doesn't get enough work in Hollywood. He's so good, he has such an imposing presence, especially when he played Bones in Get Shorty. He's good in his role here, too. I liked Jason Statham, He actually had stuff to say, and when he has stuff to say, he's not bad. But Brad Pitt really stole the spotlight, no matter how incomprehensible he is in this movie. Talking with such a thick accent all the way through, he was hilarious, and I loved that nobody else out of his family had a clue what he was saying. But like Lock, Stock, I still have issues with Guy's dialogue. There's arrogance about the way everybody talks, and they all talk the same way, like they're all talking out of the same mouth. There's no individuality to the characters. Brad and Alan Ford are the only ones who really make their characters their own. Alan's **** accent is a gift from God I tell ya, He makes a great mob boss. But I never found the movie boring, It's fast-paced and occasionally funny, but there's no wit in the writing, and the plot never takes us anywhere, it just kinda goes on without becoming anything more than what it started out as, which would've been perfectly fine had there been interesting characters thrown in the mix with better dialogue to bounce off each other.",

Of course there are various instances of the London cockney accent spoken by most of the cast but also a character or two with thick Russian accents, that sounded somewhat cheesy to say the least - oh and Brad Pitt is in it, playing an Irish boxer - his Irish accent is also, shall I say, cheesy, to put it mildly. ItsThe sheer cockiness of the characters was somewhat amusing in and of itself and, of course, it hardly goes without saying that visually there's a decent urban style aspect to it too. Some of the dialogue is amusing, such as one line which goes 'a boxing match? is there fighting involved?' hmm, I wonder(!) *doh*. Needless to say, such lines like that aside, the majority of the comedy is dark - it has quite a menacing feel to it, as you'd expect for a gritty British/English/London based gangster film.

With some filmmakers this could risk beingSnatch is Guy Ritchie's second feature film and a spiritual successor to his first film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. It has a similar style, setting and mostly the same cast from that film. With some filmmakers this could risk being repetitive and failing to live up to a previous success. But fortunately Ritchie seems to improve upon what he did in Lock, Stock in every way remaining loyal in style whilst creating a wholly original and hilarious comedy.\r Its narrative is similar to something like Pulp Fiction, since there's no single plot that the film follows. Instead it follows many insane characters as they navigate the world of London crime and watch as their stories collide in to each other (both literally and metaphorically) as they try to do every crime from rigging boxing matches to stealing a 86 carat diamond.\r And seeing these characters interactions is definitely the best part of the film. Watching their over the top personalities collide is like watching a dark British version of old Looney Tune cartoons. Even if this film had no plot at all, it could probably be sold on these insane characters alone. To match their larger than life personalities, most of the characters will also have weird but memorable names including Borris the Blade (Rade Serbedzija) a Russian gun dealer with the ability to dodge bullets and Brick Top (Alan Ford) a British gangster who rigged boxing matches and has an aggressive streak, chopping up any person who crosses him in to pieces and feeding them to pigs.\r But no character in the film is quite as bizarrely enjoyable as Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt). He's a Irish Gypsy traveller who is a bare boxing champion with the ability to knock his opponents out in one punch. He's given an Irish accent that even an Irish man would find hard to follow at points, largely in response to criticisms in the first film that many of the London accents could be hard to follow for American audiences. So this character was made so both the audience and other characters couldn't understand him. And he uses this to his advantage, setting up unfair deals and swindling all the English men out of their pockets.\r Even beyond the main characters, every side character are also very enjoyable. They seem to have a Coens Brother kind of charm to them when even if they were only on screen for 30 seconds, they kept you laughing so much in that short time that you'll still be able to leave the film thinking of them. Either because of the short dialogue having a distinct British charm to them or just because of great casting (like having a slow moving fat man as the getaway driver for a heist) that just ensures the characters all leave a lasting impression.\r Another great part about the comedy in this film is Ritchie is one of the few directors to still use the visual medium effectively to bring the laughs in his comedies. As smart and quotable as the dialogue in the film is (\"Why do they call him the bullet-dodger?\" \"Cause he dodges bullets\") the films visuals are where Ritchie real skill takes over. The use of clever editing tricks like freeze framing on a stupid face or fast editing taking you off guard in a split second allows this film to have its own distinct mark on you.\r Out of all of his films so far this is definitely Ritchie's career high point. Its impressive soundtrack, instantly quotable dialogue and memorable visuals are both very enjoyable and easily re-watchable. It's quite easily one of my favourite comedies to come out in years.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \n'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels 2' could be its real name, Ritchie is back with the second in his British gangster trilogy ('Revolver' being number three) and this time due to the success of his first venture he clearly has more money to play with so he brings in some big name stars.\r The film is almost the same kind of thing to 'Lock Stock' being another gritty, dirty, slimy cockney collaboration of tales all revolving around yet more oddball wheeler dealers, thugs and gangsters as they all try to get ahold of money, jewels and each other in (again) a Tarantino type way with more gallows humour. The cast again is fantastic and includes yet more British actors that were somehow left out of the first film, over Ritchie's films he's used every known British character actor or soap star we have. The inclusion of some big Hollywood stars actually, for me, brings the film down slightly, they don't seem realistic and can't fit into this exclusively British world thus the film loses its sense of realism, a big Hollywood star doesn't always equal a good direction to go.\r To be frank the film does really have a R. Rodriguez feel to it eg. 'Mariachi' was made, it did well so RR remade it bigger and better. 'Snatch' does seem to fall into that category to a degree, it does feel almost like a reboot or upgrade of 'Lock Stock' as some of the cast that do show up in both films are playing the same kind of role, mainly Vinnie Jones who can't really play anything else. The film has the exact same grotty feel to it with your typical South/East London looking pubs, alleys and streets, more cockney dialect to confuse any non-Londoner, more hints at vicious violence but without actually showing that much, some glorious fights and more swearing than you can possibly imagine.\r The only thing I don't like about the film is all the silly names everyone has, I just get the feeling Ritchie was trying too hard to make it in the same vain as American New York gangsters, your typical hood with his catchy nickname like Billy the rat or pool table Pauly for example, it just seemed a bit daft. Basically this is another triumph for Ritchie despite making the same film all over again. Alan Fords portrayal of Brick Top is also probably the most chilling baddie I've seen in years.",

The story is everywhere and why two stories at the same time? One captivated me (the one with the boxing because Brad Pitt was very good) and the other I didn't cared for it. The color correction was poor, lifeless, painless colors (maybe he wanted to convey a feeling but I did not feel it). I think it was not my taste ... not at all.

But I kept wondering all the wayI was literally on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie; every single scene I found very riveting, every single character I was very interested in, and every joke, and one-liner hits the mark. But I kept wondering all the way through the movie if I really understand what's going on, and that's exactly the single issue I've with Snatch.It has an unbelievably convoluted plot, and redundant characters. There are a lot of characters, which I really cared about each one of them, and every character, or rather every bunch of characters has their own sub-plot that's, for better or worse, miraculously intertwined with the very main plot.It's quite puzzling that what I consider as a flaw is somehow resulted in, or caused by, a merit that was a main reason for keeping me captivated, hence a main reason for making me extremely love this movie. And the result is while it's impossible for me to ignore how confusing, and perplexing I found this movie, there are plenty of things that more than enough to make up for that.First things first, this movie is immensely enjoyable! there is no scene or moment that I felt the movie dragged even a little bit, and that's due Ritchie's brilliant direction, and twisting script. The very British humor here is at its finest. It's all thanks to the perfect comic timing that is at its very best, the quick-cut and comedic editing, and the genius use of the already killer soundtrack.You also can see very obviously how Edgar Wright took, and developed this style, and made it his own.The characters, aside from portrayed by a stellar cast, especially Brad Pitt who stole the show as the Gypsy, Mickey O'Neil who you can barely understand a single word he says, they play a major part of the humor. Guy Ritchie found a fine line for his characters between being sympathetic and blameworthy. Once you will find yourself root for a character, and at another time you will wish this character gets harm very badly for the sake of some laughs, because Ritchie made you know very well that when things go wrong for the characters it's never so serious, and you would get some laughs from what you would never expect.The brisk dialogue serves the humor as well, but it also flesh out the characters. Many people think Guy Ritchie tried so hard to be like Tarantino, but I totally disagree with that opinion. Yes he used the dialogue that seems to add nothing to the story, and the non-linear storytelling, but he used them in his own way, and with his very exceptional style. The non-linear storytelling felt unnecessary, though.The last reason why I can partially forgive the excessive number of characters and sub-plots is that when I reached the very end of the movie, I found that I was actually got the story easily, and understood almost everything. That being said, this, in itself, emphasizes that this movie is a bit hollow, and it displays many details that don't necessarily add to the main plot. Which I found crazy, just like the movie itself!(8/10)",
