  "critic_reviews": [
    "Mr. Scott's is something that must be seen. It is, in a word, compelling.",
    "You can tell this is a smart take on Hamlet from the first wordless opening shots.",
    "In one of the most accessible versions of Hamlet yet committed to film, Campbell Scott's self-helmed Great Dane is more than ever a man for our time.",
    "The cast is similarly impressive; they're American through and through, and thankfully refrain from affecting anything remotely resembling a British stage accent.",
    "As for Scott, his rather wry interpretation is competent, but neither daring nor insightful enough to arouse any great passion.",
    "An aura of dust and mothballs evidently leaves a capable cast feeling woozy."
