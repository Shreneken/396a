    "summary": "A supernatural thriller that begs the question of who to trust, what to fear and what to believe, then topples every assumption.  (Dimension Films)",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Only some bumpy, arid passages in the script keep The Others out of the master class occupied by the likes of \"The Sixth Sense\" and, my favorite, 1961's \"The Innocents.\"",
        "An elegantly crafted entertainment, balanced between the psychological and the supernatural, that gets extra credit for not relying on computer effects.",
        "This is one scary movie, not because we see ghosts or monsters, but because Kidman makes us feel her fear as our own.",
        "Though Kidman doesn't hesitate to make Grace high-strung and as tightly wound as they come, she also projects vulnerability and courage when they're called for. It's an intense, involving performance, and it dominates and energizes a film that would be lost without it.",
        "A luxuriously old-fashioned star vehicle custom-fit to its topliner's strengths, which come across to sensational effect.",
        "It's the atmospheric sideshow that earns the highest marks.",
        "A spare, discomfiting score and uniformly excellent performances, and you have a quiet little masterpiece of dark and chilling beauty.",
        "A fiendishly subtle horror movie, a goosebump-inducing exercise in suspense that uses your own imagination to scare you silly.",
        "The most sophisticated and satisfying ghost story on film since \"The Sixth Sense.\"",
        "A minor-key ghost story with major jolts.",
        "If you like being scared, you should have fun. Bring a date to hold hands with.",
        "A tantalizing spine-tingler.",
        "The gimmicks, in the end, are too arbitrary to tie together in a memorably haunting fashion, though they do culminate in a Big Twist, a nifty one that almost -- but not quite -- makes you want to see the movie again.",
        "A classic haunted-house story enshrouded in fog and steeped in portentous atmosphere. It gives you a case of the creeps oh-so slowly, then hits you with a clever, mind-warping way of saying, \"Boo!\"",
        "There are hints of madness in all the characters, and it gets creepier and more surreal as it goes along until it finally comes to a showstopping climax that took me completely by surprise and made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up straight.",
        "The suspense is as tingly as jalapenos on the tongue.",
        "The icy reserve that sometimes stands in the way of Kidman's expressive gifts here becomes the foundation of her most emotionally layered performance to date.",
        "In drawing out his effects, Amenabar is a little too confident that style can substitute for substance. As our suspense was supposed to be building, our impatience was outstripping it.",
        "Beautiful to behold but lacking in any kind of palpable dread or suspense.",
        "Kidman gets kudos for giving the enterprise a touch of class, while the film gives the studio's library a rare pedigreed addition.",
        "Isn't much more than a proficient gothic mystery with a final twist that offers a satisfying little frisson before you start counting how many times it's been used before.",
        "The payoff matters at least as much as the setup, and this story's secret is way too easy to guess.",
        "The Others is great as a collection of acknowledgments, but a ghost story made of a bunch of ghoulish thank-yous isn't that haunting.",
        "This is a subdued and sometimes subtle exercise in ghostly doings, going against the horror-movie grain by relying on quietude and understatement.",
        "The big surprise is so obvious that it makes the deliberate pacing seem painfully slow, and Kidman's prissy accent and tight-lipped performance are more than a little grating.",
        "What Amenabar offers here is an unconvincing, pretentiously artsy pastiche of just about every hoary old gothic thriller you can think of."

With an impressively deceptive screenplay, one believes everything that Grace (Nicole Kidman) goes through and believes, but as her perception changes, so does the viewers until one is not quite sure what one ought to believe. Excellently directed by Alejandro Amenabar, who also did the soundtrack and wrote the screenplay, with some amazing cinematography and film editing, \"The Others\" manages to create such a genuinely spooky mood that one just cannot tear oneself away from watching the film through the end. The cast is impressive, to say the least. Nicole Kidman gives one of her best performances to date, as the grief-stricken, somewhat psychotic mother trying to protect her children at all costs. The children actors are excellent, also, as well as the servants in the film - especially, Fionnula Flanagan, who delivers a chilling performance as Mrs Mills.Overall, the film is definitely worth seeing and is one of the scariest and gripping films that will make you wonder about it for days and days...",

This isn't a typical \"haunted house movie\" or \"ghost story\" either, and there is absolutely nothing corny about it. Kidman, of all cast members, delivers a fantastic performance (as usual). The film tells the haunting tale of a woman who returns to her mansion, after her husband begins to fight in World War II, with her two young children, who are highly sensitive to light stronger than that given off by a candle, and an elderly woman serving as a nanny. The terror begins when her two children begin claiming to see \"ghosts\", which at first she does not believe, but is eventually forced to, when she sees no coincidence between her children's tellings and the evidence of intruders in the house. If there's one horror movie that should have been won the awards for (at least) Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound Editing at the Academy Awards, THE OTHERS is that film. It creates enough suspense and terror to keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole, entire feature. It is a definite must-see.",

Featuring a stellar score composed by Amenabar himself, The Others also has a great lead performance from Nicole Kidman and good supporting turns from Fionnula Flanagan, Alakina Mann, and James Bentley.

The great music accompanying the film is also a major player in this role as he truly keeps you on the edge of your seat. The plot as a whole is also very good and the storyline is well conceived and executed. In addition, the twists and turns this one takes really elevate it above your typical ghost story. Finally, the cinematography is gorgeous. Largely taking place at a single location, the film utilizes it to its full creepy potential and quite beautifully at the same time.

Amenabar's execution is brimmed with suchtoo sincere to its mannerism..The OthersThe Others is a character driven horror drama about a mysterious house that reveals horrifying truth to a slightly superstitious and a bit deranged family. Amenabar's execution is brimmed with such panache that it uses concepts of mirage and lightings and such other tricky camera work to scare the bejesus out of the audience rather than relying upon typical hokum equations like creatures or benign art designing to enhance its intensity. The malleable mythological tale with an updated version that actually warps us back to ancient times, is the key and the theme that fuels this poised and reserved tale that is too sincere to its mannerism. The background score is brilliant along with the jaw dropping cinematography, sharp sound effects and fine editing. The narrative is way too sharp than it seems and the primary reason to that is the awareness of the writer of the chemistry and the equation and each tiny characteristic of the characters. This is not your average scoreboard mentality natured script, it runs on merit of bratty and rebellious kids against the overprotective emotions which will leave you shook on your seats. Kidman is the only performer in here that makes it all work and flaunts her potential to make you writhe on your seat by being on the same side of the coin as yours. Each mirror on screen, each ray of candlelight, each shady room and each painting, everything that Amenabar places on screen, he is fiddling with you subconsciously while we sit nervously and our fingers half eaten off as he narrates it. Kidman's stellar performance and Amenabar's finesse on execution and his jagged script are the high points of the feature. The Others is a lot about us and that is how we are able to easily communicate with them, you'd want to find out who is singing.",

While her husband is fighting the Nazis, she lives isolatedIn this film, a mother tries to educate her two children by herself, protecting them from a mysterious illness that causes them great sensitivity to intense lights, such as sunlight. While her husband is fighting the Nazis, she lives isolated in a Channel Islands mansion, keeping the house in partial darkness along with three mysterious servants. The lead role is played by Nicole Kidman, who does a brilliant performance in a character who sometimes seems very loving, almost needy, and other times seems unusually hard. But she's just a woman trying to bear a burden that seems heavy: the burden of carrying everything back while her husband is away. The children are equally interesting: played by James Bentley and Alakina Mann, two very competent young actors, they are naive, sweet but also very mischievous, and their mischief contributes greatly to the suspense, especially the girl. She seems to know something that nobody else knows or to have a particularly sharp intelligence. The father, played by Christopher Eccleston, is almost a mere figure. He is purposely an absent character who is permanently present for the simple fact of all the others are constantly speaking of him, and this absence has great importance to the psyche of his wife. But the true life of this film is borrowed by Fionnula Flanagan and Eric Sykes who (along with Elaine Cassidy) give life to the house servants. The way they acted and how counter-acted with Kidman is brilliant, giving the film a deeply conspiratorial atmosphere. The constant darkness, the gas lights, the huge old house, the permanent haze surrounding the grounds are clich\u00e9 elements that give the film a touch of elegance and help the audience to grab to the movie until the end, which is quite unexpected and disconcerting.",

It did feel pretty spooky and atmospheric and the story was intriguing enough to keep me interested to watch it right through until the end.It was a good length and didn't seem to lag at any particular point. It had good acting, I felt that Nicole Kidman and the two child actor/actresses were particularly good, giving very realistic and believable performances and all in all it felt like a pretty high quality production, so it is worth seeing, although its not a particularly fast paced movie but rather more of a spooky slow burner, I suppose.I'm not usually interested in period dramas but I do like a good supernatural movie, or ghost story, so this fit that well.The main downsides to it, if any, is that it doesn't feature any amazing special effects, so don't watch it if thats what your looking for, its more a modern 1940s movie I suppose and it may be possible for others to guess some of whats going on before its revealed, though there is an extra twist at the end, which will probably surprise most. I thought that the end was pretty good but I suppose if you've seen many similar movies then it may be possible to figure it out.All in all, it struck me as being a good, quality production. The story was interesting enough to keep me interested and there are some twists towards the end, although we, as viewers, are kept somewhat in the dark (har har) for most of the movie, its worth it to wait until the end when all is spookily revealed.I thought that the story was pretty good in general and I would say that its worth watching, for the performances alone almost. It did seem a pretty traditional ghost story made for the screen and it did work, all in all, pretty well, so I would recommend it.",
