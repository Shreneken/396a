  "summary": "A police drama about a veteran officer (Denzel Washington) who escorts a rookie (Ethan Hawke) on his first day with the LAPD's tough inner-city narcotics unit.  [Warner Bros.]",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "One of the finest cops-and-robbers thrillers of recent years.",
    "Ominously atmospheric study of police corruption dangles danger and sinister motives at every turn.",
    "Denzel Washington ventures into the dark side as a seriously corrupt narcotics cop in Training Day, and the results are electrifying. So is the picture, thanks to taut, sinewy direction by Antoine Fuqua and a compelling script by David Ayer (The Fast and the Furious).",
    "Be warned: Though it's entirely justified by the story, there's a level of violence and brutality in Training Day -- that some terror-weary audience members may not care to cope with these days.",
    "A taut, high-velocity film that departs from the action flick template by having actual ideas.",
    "If nothing else, Training Day is a gorgeous pedestal for Denzel Washington.",
    "On a purely visceral level, Training Day is easily the most exciting movie out there right now, but as a morality tale with anything large on its mind, it's a cop-out.",
    "Antoine Fuqua's propulsive, elegantly written police thriller, offers the unsettling spectacle of Denzel Washington.",
    "Washington creates an indelibly charming and terrifying character whose volatile blend of dedication and horrible expediency keeps us off balance.",
    "A razor-wire-taut (and extremely violent) exploration of what happens when good guys go bad, badder, baddest.",
    "With its unflinching style, Training Day can be hard to sit through at times. But it's worth the discomfort for the adrenaline rush of the plot and Washington's compelling performance.",
    "This is a movie that rocks and socks you, and has a performance by Washington that's ruthless and scary. But in the end, it leaves you unmarked.",
    "Even when it falls back excessively on coincidence and contrived set pieces, even when it gushes irretrievably over the top in its final act, Washington makes Training Day sizzle.",
    "It is so propulsive so much of the time, it almost looks as if it's going to go the distance. If Washington & Co. don't quite manage to bring it home, the getting there sure is something.",
    "Even if the movie loses its nerve at the end, that doesn't take anything away from Washington's performance.",
    "The movie raises questions that are on plenty of minds right now, including whether and how much the rules should be bent to wage a war (in this case, on drugs) that cannot be won conventionally.",
    "So extreme is his mad dog behavior, indeed, that it shades over into humor: Washington seems to enjoy a performance that's over the top and down the other side.",
    "Bit of melodramatic grandstanding that it is -- is made irrelevant by Washington's volcanic energy and fierce conviction.",
    "Mr. Washington's dry-ice grandeur -- the predator's reflexes contrasting with a pensive mouth -- deserves regard, and his powerhouse virtuosity will almost guarantee him an Oscar nomination.",
    "Though Training Day doesn't resolve itself as well as it deserves and ends strictly cops-and-robbers style, it's given us some great acting and something to ponder. Not every cop show can lay claim to that.",
    "Training Day has the best performances and worst third act of any movie you're likely to see this year.",
    "But this is Washington's show, his Scarface, if you will, and his smiling, seductive monster is a thrilling creation that gives Training Day all the bite it needs.",
    "Even after it becomes clearer which side of law Harris is operating on, the film continues to work as a taut -- if violent -- police thriller.",
    "It's a little depressing to see such a thrilling talent deployed in such an ordinary and sordid movie. Training Day isn't awful, but it's absolutely nothing special.",
    "As exhausting as it is exhilarating to watch, the film in the end is less than fully satisfying.",
    "There's no denying that Washington can play a rococo villain with flip ebullience, but I fervently wish he were doing it in a movie that paid more than lip service to the real world.",
    "The masochistic brutality it's selling still seems glaringly out of step with the current mood of the country.",
    "One of those movie equivalents of a freeway pileup -- it's a mess, at once insistently watchable and a total dead end.",
    "A blandly twisting plot with no meaningful revelations or substantial themes."

The action, the one-liners, the immortalized ending, the shady characters, the fact that this was filmed in the real gang areas in LA, and the look into the face of evil (Denzel) really made this movie shine.

Never has the line between right and wrong on the streets of LA been more poetic and  indulging. Denzel Washington is captivating in his role as Alonzo the mesmerising hard faced detective willing to go to unsettling methods to reign in the narcotics line bulging through the drug dominated neighborhoods our protagonists drive through. Ethan Hawke is also perfectly cast and a first day on the job trails for Washington's unit. His upstanding ethos twinned with his Innocent damaged gaze gives the two leads their Shakespearean explosiveness and appeal. Fuqua's real triumph however dwells in his shooting of an authentic  LA. The city being the muse and center of the film. The real people , the culture and the threat of their lives are entangled in our characters story. A massive step forward in film making.

Unlike most of his roles Denzel Washington's Alonzo Harris is an absolute monster.  Cruel, violent, deceitful, and downright nasty, he makes other loose cannon cops like John McClane seem like SpongeBob in the episode where he becomes a hall-monitor.  Denzel rightfully earned an Oscar in this role.  Dafoe also does a great job, which earned him an Oscar nomination as well.  This movie is a gritty, exhilarating, and extremely well crafted thrill ride.  There are plot twists and turns you won't expect, as well as lots of memorable dialogue and action.  Corruption and morally ambiguous situations literally stuff the film, which makes it as thought provoking as it is visceral.  Near the ending there is a generic and basically pointless chase scene which took up enough time to force me into giving it an 8 instead of a nine, but don't let this quibble discourage you from seeing it.  Thanks to Training Day, the next time I walk into the DVD store, I know which movie I'm looking for first.",

Harris gives Hoyt one simple task; accompany him on a one-day ride-along where he must prove himself worthy of enlistment. Now from this point on the movie maintains a steady level of immense entertainment. The most noteworthy aspect of this movie is Denzel Washington's Academy-Award Winning portrayal of Alonzo Harris; the rugged cop that has seemingly blurred the line between what is right and what isn't. His performance is as charismatic and imposing, as it is chilling and antagonizing. Every line that Washington delivered was either intensely funny or incredibly demented (but still funny). Which brings me to the script; \"The Fast And The Furious\" writer, David Ayer, delivers deeply provocative dialogue, as well as a compelling narrative that delves into some very insightful themes. The main theme of the movie, however, seems to be a blend of the \"Crime doesn't pay\"",

I liked the plot, and that's about all I would highlight. Don't expect any flashy action here. The pace is slower. This is exactly what hit my taste though, as I prefer slower films that climax at the end. As I said, I thought it was an interesting plot and I was even surprised at how it ended. For me, a great film that I can recommend to fans of the crime genre.",
