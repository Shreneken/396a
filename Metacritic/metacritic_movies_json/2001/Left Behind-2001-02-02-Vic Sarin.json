  "summary": "In one chaotic moment, millions people around the world suddenly disappear.  This is the rapture that God has planned as the first sign to begin the unraveling of the end of time.  (Left Behind Productions)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Hark! A Christian thriller about the Last Days that doesn't (totally) suck. That's got to be a sign of the times.",
    "Might be extremely effective while preaching to the converted, but it's no great shakes as secular entertainment.",
    "With an appealing lead in Cameron, and a nicely brisk pace, there's a decent, midlevel Apocalypse movie here. But be aware that you will have to peel away several pages of the Bible to get to it.",
    "Seems perfectly timed to coincide with the ascension to office of George W. Bush. It's a clunky effort Bush could have written and directed.",
    "This picture's b-movie values probably play better on video than in theaters.",
    "Piously acted, stiffly directed, and infused with a view of world politics that might charitably be described as delusional.",
    "For all its intimations of fire and brimstone, the film isn't remotely frightening, and the high-school-level acting doesn't help.",
    "A slow-moving, dirt-dull narrative crammed with clunky expository dialogue and obscure Biblical references.",
    "Watching Left Behind's plodding screen adaptation may make you feel the Deity has already abandoned us to a shockingly dull post-apocalypse.",
    "A blundering cringefest, thanks to unintentionally laughable dialogue, hackneyed writing and uninspired direction.",
    "It's well-shot and well-edited by Hollywood standards, though special effects don't reach the top Hollywood level. The stars have their hearts in their work: Cameron and Johnson don't have great depth but give their all. Currie makes a subtle villain.",
    "The loosely scripted story is further burdened with clunky dialogue and performances,\r\nshoddy continuity."
