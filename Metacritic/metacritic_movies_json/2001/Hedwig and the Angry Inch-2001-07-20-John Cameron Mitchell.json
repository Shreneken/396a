  "summary": "Adapted from the critically acclaimed off-Broadway rock theatre hit, Hedwig and the Angry Inch tells the story of an 'internationally ignored' rock singer, Hedwig, and her search for stardom and love.  (Fine Line Features)",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The sight of Hedwig and his band transforming a trashy trailer into a glitter-rock stage during \"Wig in a Box\" was so exhilarating I almost leapt out of my seat. The movie is pure theater, as it should be.",
    "Builds into a moment of such gorgeous rocking that you truly lose yourself in some musical otherworld you never dreamed you'd reach in current films.",
    "The story is told so passionately that it demands as much of you as it does of its performers, all of whom are up there, giving everything.",
    "On the screen, the rip-roaring rock musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch retains all the excitement and energy it had on stage while adding depth, clarity and emotional texture.",
    "Mitchell retools his play magnificently, opening it up into a vibrant cinematic work.",
    "Clever, funny, wildly innovative film.",
    "The film's not only funny and weird, it's oddly poignant. I miss Hedwig already.",
    "Mitchell directs and stars in the riotous, loving, and only occasionally pathos-milking film adaptation of his own acclaimed Off Broadway play, with great up-your-ante music and lyrics by Stephen Trask.",
    "John Cameron Mitchell credits Plato as the inspiration for his rock musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Now Mitchell has turned his play into a raucous, touching celebration of a film.",
    "Mitchell gives this post-punk, neo-glam rock extravaganza everything in his loaded arsenal of talents. He gets the sound right, the look right, the fun right and - this is crucial - the pain right.",
    "Offers an enormous amount of pure silly fun for the entire non-nuclear family, no matter what gender they may be.",
    "Mitchell, who also directed and wrote the screenplay, originally created this glorious rock opera for the stage with composer-lyricist Stephen Trask.",
    "It's a positive hat trick by John Cameron Mitchell.",
    "Wildly witty, but also inventive, audacious and poignant.",
    "Ever hear of a rock musical that actually rocked? John Cameron Mitchell's glorious adaptation of his acclaimed Off-Broadway show might be a first.",
    "There's some kind of pulse of sincerity beating below the glittering surface, and it may come from Mitchell's own life story.",
    "There's a lot more at work in this raucously entertaining movie than cross-dressing clich√©s.",
    "This drag-queen melodrama, like its star, perseveres.",
    "Cameron's imaginative directing and screen-shaking performance give this rock musical plenty of oomph.",
    "The production is fantastically funny, high-energy camp, punctuated by Trask's infectious score and by Mitchell, dressing in a succession of wigs twice the size of his body.",
    "Falters in its final 15 minutes, when the funny lines peter out and the flashbacks get fuzzy.",
    "(Mitchell's) Hansel may be small-boned and soft-featured in an androgynous way, but his Hedwig is a force of nature, burned out and jaded yet brimming with compassion and bursting with energy.",
    "A screen spectacle that beseeches its audience for adoration and mass acceptance.",
    "Despite some imaginative packaging too often proves a drag in more than the sartorial sense. Taking Mitchell's sketchy book far too seriously, the movie grows leaden between its terrific songs.",
    "It's this strategy (however unconscious), and not simply a lack of directing talent, that makes Hedwig so relentlessly assaultive, heavy-handed, and emotionally monochromatic."

John Cameron Mitchell's Hedwig and the Angry Inch, is part love story, part comedy, part tragedy and 100 percent Rock and Roll Musical. Mitchell plays the lead roll of Hedwig with bravura, soul, and wreckless abandonment of what anyone thinks. This is a film for anyone who looking for love, has been in love, or fallen out of love. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll watch it again and again. The replay value is astonishing considering there is fantastic costuming, amazing songs, various storyline angles and just plain memorable fun. Truly one of the best movies I have ever seen. Deeply touching and emotional you won't be disappointed.",

The quirkyness and sincerity combined make this absolutely amazing. This is one of the rare movies that can competently compete on several different levels, in many genres. It's out there and wacky, but also sensitive and it respects it's own ludicrous characters enough to give them the film they deserve. Not in everyone's tase, I'm willing to bet- I think this one requires a very open mind and broad taste, but once you get into a rhythm on this one, it's addictive.",
