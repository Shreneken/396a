  "critic_reviews": [
    "Not about the justice or injustice of the legal system. Rather it's about the tragedy of Sam's predicament.",
    "Penn makes us take the leap required by Kristine Johnson and Jessie Nelson's screenplay -- you end up deeply caring about Sam and Lucy.",
    "A warm, hard-to-resist story.",
    "Penn's stark and unvarnished portrait of the challenged Sam makes even the hardest-to-swallow plot acceptable.",
    "The role sounds like a sentimental trap, but Penn doesn't fall into it. It's a sensational performance, and he illumines a movie that sometimes seems in danger of descending into modish Hollywood political correctness.",
    "Ham-handedly manipulative film.",
    "The cancer of dishonesty begins to grow half an hour into the film, and it riddles the picture by the end.",
    "Just don't believe the anti-hype. There are lots of reasons to have a good cry these days -- here's a nice, warm place to get squeezed.",
    "The kind of performance Penn delivers in I Am Sam, which may look hard, is easy, compared, say, to his amazing work in Woody Allen's \"Sweet and Lowdown.\"",
    "I can imagine the pitch meeting: \"It's 'Kramer vs. Kramer' meets 'Forrest Gump.' No, wait, 'Rainman' has a baby!\"",
    "The dumbing down of low-IQ sentimentality.",
    "By-the-numbers Oscar bait -- but Penn does manage, against such odds, to make us see Sam as a person, not a performance.",
    "Not a bad movie, and its intentions are unimpeachable. But its sentimentality is so relentless and its narrative so predictable that the life is very nearly squeezed out of it.",
    "This isn't an ordinary film built on a remarkable performance; it's a poor one with a gem at its core. Penn can elevate it to mediocrity, but he cannot make it fly.",
    "Contrived, manipulative and shamelessly sentimental, this film is notable for the courageous reach of Sean Penn, who gives a bold, heartfelt performance.",
    "Well-intentioned but ludicrous tale.",
    "It’s a heart-tugging scenario undermined by a striking hypocrisy: obscuring a hot-button issue in casting, some actors with Down's syndrome have minor roles, while Penn plays the lead -- and chews the scenery.",
    "I Am Sam is about as connected to the real world as Dr. Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham, from which its title is derived -- in fact, in the realism department, Seuss may have the edge.",
    "It's a difficult issue, one that is not well served by a hollow confection like I Am Sam.",
    "The film is so busy that every minute is exhausting. It's as if the filmmakers were idealistic teen-agers afflicted with a group case of Attention Deficit Disorder.",
    "The film means well, but each scene gets clobbered by sappy screenwriting.",
    "Drawn out and dishonest in equal measure, Sam fights it out with \"The Majestic\" for the title of worst \"important\" movie of the year.",
    "The movie that Disney uses to explore this premise drips with so much corporate good-neighbor syrup, you might want to wear something waterproof. And Penn's performance is, at best, ripe for discussion.",
    "Is this what Sean Penn has come to in his 40s? He hasn't appeared this retarded since he was married to Madonna.",
    "An especially insipid example of the Hollywood message movie.",
    "In one of the year's most woefully manipulative and oppressively pandering offerings: I Am Sam, a dolled-up TV movie-of-the-week masquerading as profound cinema.",
    "Penn's portrayal strikes me as equally insensitive. It's the nightmare performance of 2001.",
    "Actual concussive cranial abuse would be preferable to Jessie Nelson's I Am Sam.",
    "It's a bad movie that only a parent could love."

It is true what Chicago Sun-times wrote that every device of the movie is designed is to convince us Lucy must stay with Sam even though common sense makes it impossible to go the distance with the premise, but this doesn't make it a bad movie.

A film involving a true ethical dilemma. It hard not to get emotionally involved with the film. Sean Penn is amazing in the lead role, which if it had have been released a different it likely would have won him an Oscar (Penn lost the 2002 to Denzel Washington for his role in Training Day, which is hard to object). Michelle Pfeiffer was also great in her role as she develops more and more throughout the film. Sam is a character that is as lovable as any character could ever be. His meetings with his friends are great scenes to watch, they are very cute.",

Armed with such potential and considerably explored by the filmmakers in many ways, it offers expectations with such huge cast. As much as honest and pathos its ideology is, the methods that it adapts to draw in the emotions out from the viewers is pure manipulation. The plot track wanders in without any whatsoever connection or logic and visits pointless places for more than two hours. As it ages on screen, there is neither sincerity, mannerism and maturity in script to breed any aspects of the feature appropriately. The screenplay is so naive and inedible that viewers cringe on seat as the makers attempt to attain a closure of their self-created destructive bubble. The primary reason why it doesn't work is its futile constant knack for drawing out a chuckle and its shallow script that it surfs through the entire feature. Penn's riveting performance is genuinely moving, to a point where it carries off the entire tale on merit and makes it worth surviving for the viewers. As much as brilliant Penn is, Pfeiffer couldn't be more distracted whilst Fanning shows some promising skills. The background score is pointless with immature camera work and daft and questionable cinematography. The screenwriter and director Nelson not only possess sloppy writing skills with incoherent forcibly imputed sequences but also lacks execution skills which is demoted by its confused camera work. Penn is the only high point of the feature as it elevates the momentum as much as he can. I Am Sam is Penn claiming the title of being an actor, and it aches to encounter such a talent go waste by on something so fatuous.",

Seann Penn gives a great performance as the titular character. I imagine a film such as this will have brought a lot of controversy at the time it came out, due to the actor not having a related mental/emotional disability as portrayed in the film but I did feel the sensitive subject areas covered were treated with respect. I thought this was quite a memorable film, although it is a bit hard to watch at times, again due to the films themes. It also features a nice soundtrack, with most of the songs performed having been written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney and are sung by Sarah McLachlan, Sheryl Crow etc. This film is well worth a watch for the depiction of how vulnerable people are treated in modern American society and highlights compassion at times (which isn't to say everything goes perfectly, certainly not), if nothing else, so I would definitely recommend it, even though having some tissues to hand may be an idea if your prone to crying when watching emotional films!.",
