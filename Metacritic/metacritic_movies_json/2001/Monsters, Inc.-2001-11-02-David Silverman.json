    "summary": "The Academy Award-winning creators of \"Toy Story\" open the door to a frightfully funny world of monsters and mayhem and scare up lots of laughs in their new movie, Monsters, Inc.  [Disney/Pixar]",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "As giddy and antic as any great Warner Bros. cartoon of the 1930s and '40s -- it bears seeing more than once, if only to allow for the sight gags that play second fiddle to the plot, a rarity in animation -- but also resonant and real. In other words, it's the perfect movie.",
        "It's the Pixar animators who keep grown-ups as riveted as the kids with visual marvels that dazzle and delight.",
        "The story's charming, the set pieces are wildly inventive, and even the throwaway one-liners, about everything from movie-animation pioneer Ray Harryhausen to the old Oscar Meyer jingle, are hilarious.",
        "It's unfailingly lively entertainment that doesn't stint on (earned) feeling. Ideas about fear of the unknown, industrial corruption, and the splendours of polymorphity are all taken in stride. The balance tilts towards action and gags, and does them gloriously.",
        "There hasn't been a film in years to use creative energy as efficiently as Monsters, Inc.",
        "It comes from Pixar, the animation studio that scored with the \"Toy Story\" series and \"A Bug's Life,\" and it has more zip and a tad less soul than those predecessors.",
        "The climax, featuring what's essentially a suspended roller coaster of closet doors, is as thrilling as it is imaginative.",
        "Movies like Monsters, Inc. literally make you feel like a kid again, marveling at the joyously inventive sights before you, and that's a feat that should not be taken lightly.",
        "\"Shrek\" is a scintilla funnier, \"Toy Story 2\" a hair's breadth more poignant, but \"MI\" is every bit as imaginative and lovable as these other contemporary animation classics.",
        "Smart, funny and ingeniously detailed with terrific vocal teamwork.",
        "Though the comedy is sometimes more frenetic than inspired and viewer emotions are rarely touched to any notable degree, the movie is as visually inventive as its Pixar predecessors.",
        "Not quite up to the exalted level of the two predecessors (\"Toy Story\" and \"Toy Story 2\"), be assured it's still the most eye-popping and thoroughly entertaining animated film to come down the pike so far this year.",
        "Confirms that despite all the technical tools at their disposal, one thing counts head and shoulders above razzle-dazzle eye candy (or anything else, for that matter): the story and characters, and Monsters, Inc. introduces worthy additions to the Pixar pantheon.",
        "Much more kid-oriented than any other computer-animated movie thus far. In other words, it's much more Disneyish. I enjoyed it.",
        "An unprecedented friendship between a monster and a child leads to an amazing chase scene.",
        "The spirited interplay between Goodman and Crystal is both wacky and, dare I say, charming.",
        "The movie's cutest twist is that the monsters are more scared of kids than kids are of them, because they think human children are toxic.",
        "Funny and sweet enough to delight kids and inventive enough to satisfy adults.",
        "Monsters, Inc. has got that swing, that zippity, multilevel awareness of kids'-eye sensibilities and adult-pitched humor.",
        "Monsters, Inc. is cheerful, high-energy fun, and like the other Pixar movies, has a running supply of gags and references aimed at grownups.",
        "It's a nice movie. But Disney has never learned that \"nice,\" especially in comedy, is a negative virtue.",
        "Clever and jokey in a vaudeville sort of way, but lacks the heart and sheer imagination of the company's best work for Disney, \"Toy Story 2\" and \"A Bug's Life.\"",
        "Doesn\u2019t have the warmth of the Toy Story pictures, but it still boasts a very entertaining slapstick-farce structure and some neat hairy, oozy, tendrilly creatures.",
        "Though it has its charms, Monsters, Inc. does not measure up. As a childhood entertainment it is certainly fine, but Pixar's celebrated lure for adults is largely absent.",
        "The funny lines fall flat and the relationships and conversations among adult characters are straight out of 1950s sitcoms. Now that's scary.",
        "But Monsters, Inc. -- directed by Pixar soldier Pete Docter, not by master digital comic John Lasseter -- turns out to be stingy on context, commentary, and the prism-ing view of pop culture that made the earlier films mint."

It's aMonsters, Inc. is film animation at its most heart-warming, poignant and hilarious. The film is not just a simple, pretty diversion to keep the young ones quiet for 90 minutes, but an incredibly clever, multi-faceted film for all ages. It's a buddy movie, it's a work-based sitcom, an imaginative fantasy film, and most pleasingly a biting and intelligent satire on both the world energy crisis and the over-exposure of children to increasingly horrific images in the modern world. Inventively, the monster city is not powered by electricity, gas and oil, but by children's screams, which the workers of Monsters Incorporated, dubbed \"scarers\" are tasked with collecting by going through portals into the human world, portals which appear as closet doors in the bedrooms of children. The monster world is facing an energy shortage due to the fact that kids \"just don't get scared like they used to\", resulting in some monsters resorting to increasingly drastic and amoral techniques to extract childrens' screams. The cast all give sterling vocal performances - John Goodman's hairy soft-hearted giant Sulley and Billy Crystal's minuscule green cyclops Mike make a great comedy double-act, Steve Buscemi's reptilian villain Randall is appropriately slimy and conniving, and the staggeringly multi-talented animator/writer/director/occasional actor Bob Peterson voices the cynical slug-secretary-from-hell Roz, and never fails to raise a smile. Monsters, Inc. gets the balance between vastly differing moods just right, with cuteness (Sulley's adorable father-daughter relationship with Boo), humour (anything said or done by Mike) and darkness (Randall's unsavory evil master plan) all given equal service throughout the film by director Pete Doctor and the multiple writers. I also challenge anyone who's in possession of a working heart not to blub at the film's bittersweet, utterly heartbreaking finale. This might provoke considerable debate amongst Pixar devotees (as the vast majority of the studio's output is jolly good, afterall) but I say that Monsters, Inc., while only being the fourth film released, is the very best work the animation powerhouse has produced thus far. It's truly Pixar's finest hour not only due to its flawless technical craftsmanship, but because of its abundance of heart and soul.",

There is an imaginative concept behind the Monsters world. The characters are likeable. Plus, the animation is great giving us a bright and colorful world. On the other hand, this film does not offer much for an older audience. The story does not have much too it and the characters are simple, both lacking the sosphistication of later Pixar films and Toy Story although I have not seen the original in a while so I cannot say that. So I will wrap up my review with this. If you have little kids and you are looking for something fun and safe to show them, show them this film they will probably love it like I did back when I first saw the film in first grade. However, if you are looking for animated film with some sophistication then you might want to look elsewhere. While Monsters Inc. is a great kids film it is an ok film. Given the weak performance of Cars 2, which is for babies, and Brave, which was consisted mostly of an unoriginal story with only the last third being interesting, I am worried that Monsters University will be another film for the kiddies as opposed to the people who saw the original as kids and are now adults and/or in college.",

When I was younger, I would always have a few movies to watch whenever I was in a bad mood and this was one of them.  This movie has such great laughs and likable characters that you must have a heart made of stone not to love.  The animation is beautiful even to this day and you can't help but smile at the colors and appeal that this film gives off.  All the settings that you see were beautiful for its time and the characters look incredible for being so early in the stages of computer animation.  We all were scared of the darkness and monsters at one point in our lives, and if you weren't, well then you will still love this film.  Pixar has always had a knack for making lovable characters, and I think with this movie they show some of their most creative and fun characters of all.  The movie talks about friendship, and although many children's movies talk about that, I think this movie is one of the first to do it correctly.  There isn't much to talk about in a film that has been out for about 11 years, but I think we can all agree this is a classic piece of animation and one that everyone, both young and old, can love.",

It was the movie I got most excited for to watch, fast forward eleven years and I still get excited for it. This monster world is so different from what we know yet so interesting and fun. Their source of power comes from the screams of children which seems so very strange but in the context of this film, makes perfect sense. I am never forced to accept anything the film throws at me, I choose to accept them because they make sense.\r Another important reason for why I love Monsters, Inc. is the characters. James P. Sullivan is our protagonist. He is very good at his job, known to many as the top Scarer in Monstropolis. Throughout this film, Sullivan's perspective on everything changes while his caring and comforting character grows stronger. His best friend and roommate, Mike Wazowski, is a funny and smart character who sometimes fails to see the obvious. He is full of energy and charisma, making it impossible for me to dislike him.\r Apart from the characters and the beautiful chemistry they share, the story is very well written and enjoyable. It had some hilarious laugh out loud moments, but also some very sad ones. The 3-D is okay, but seems non-existent at times.\rAnyone who hasn't seen this movie yet must do so, and those who have should go back and revisit it. It's the well written story, the colorful characters and the heart this film carries that makes it such a timeless classic.",

The movie's got a great plot which is pretty much about these scarers and it includes Sully (John Goodman) as the main scarer and Mike (Billy Crystal) as his best friend.After we get to know these two characters, we later realise that a little girl gets into the monstropolis and they've got to get her back to her door before it's too late.Sully and Mike have got great chemistry with each other throughout this movie and those two are honestly hilarious characters throughout this movie.Also, you can tell that the pixar team have put lots of time and effort into making the animation look brilliantly good, especially the fur on certain characters like Sully.The characters are very memorable and they're not very forgettable at all, the main characters throughout this movie have a lot of heart and soul which I honestly love about these classic Pixar movies.Finally, all the voice actors suit who they play and they do a very good job on their dialogue and playing the role of their characters throughout this movie.The humour throughout this movie is honestly great, I actually forgot on how good the humour really was while watching this movie again.Also, I'm pretty sure right Henry J. Waternoose III is actually a nonce in this movie, he says this exact quote \"I'll kidnap a thousand children before I let this company die\".Overall, Monsters, Inc.

A children\u2019s movie does not just contain the friendly voices behind animated characters in a made up world.  A movie for children is much more than just the goofy characters, the vibrant colors, and the silly skit.  The make or break of a children\u2019s movie is one thing: the moral.\rIn the fall of 2001, together, Disney and Pixar came out with another classic movie of made up worlds and interesting creatures.  Director Pete Docter, with co-directors David Silverman and Lee Unkrich, created a movie for all the viewers to watch and take a small life lesson from.  The entertaining, comical, and adventurous movie is aimed at the younger children, but some life lesson can be taken from the movie for those of all ages.\rMonster\u2019s Inc. is a movie unlike any the children have seen before.  The originality of this film lies in the plot of the skit, as a message to the children behind the lines.  Not only is Monster\u2019s Inc. an animated film, with fuzzy characters, in a fantasy world, but also gives the young viewers a lesson to watch and take from the events of the movie.\rAlthough some may say that the \u201ccharm\u201d of this film is from the vocal cast, they are only looking at the movie from an educated adults view.  The targeted viewers for Monster\u2019s Inc. are the young children, given from the animations.\rBased on the common criteria of animations, vocals, colors, scenery, characters, etc., the movie alone rates very well.  The uniqueness of each character adds to the moral of the movie.  Sully, the big-hearted monster, with this \u201cpartner in crime\u201d Mike, the small comical monster, make a great dynamic duo.  Together, they are the top ranking partnership in their \u201cscream factory\u201d, bringing in the most money by walking into different worlds through kid\u2019s closets and scaring them to record their screams for the monster\u2019s worlds power.\rThe movie seems to sound like a horror film, monsters crawling into kid\u2019s rooms from their closet and scaring them.  Well that\u2019s the twist with the moral.  The town\u2019s biggest, scariest monster is actually the one with the biggest heart.  The monster Mike, looks scary with his one eye, but is actually extremely comical.\rWhen one \u201cscare\u201d goes wrong, and a human, Boo, is released into the monster\u2019s world, she becomes acquainted with Sully and Mike.  At first the monsters are afraid of Boo, because it\u2019s believed that they have diseases and will kill the monsters.  How ironic, that the little human girl is afraid of the big monsters?  After a night, they become friends but Sully and Mike must hide Boo from the rest of the community because having her holds the risk of being fired.\rBoo\u2019s name comes from her as a human and living in the monsters world.  Ironically, she is not scared of the monsters, but the monsters are scared of her.  The uniqueness of this idea adds to the entertainment of the film, showing that not everything is how it seems.  In reality, Boo should be scared of the monsters, but she is not.\rThis ironic plot gives the movie a different outcome of the overall moral: don\u2019t judge a book by the cover.  Just because something is believed to be scary, like monsters coming out of the closet, does not mean that they are scary in reality.  Just because Mike and Sully are monsters, and they look strange, different, and scary, does not mean that they actually are.  The main message given to the children teaches them that a monster, or anything else, is not actually what it appears to be.  Sully is big and scary, but in reality, he is not and he actually has the biggest heart.\rViewers of this movie should come out feeling as though they should reevaluate what they feared, or judged too quickly.  Not everything is how it should seem.  Ordinary children associate monsters as scary creatures to be afraid of and fear.  Monster\u2019s Inc. takes this fear of monsters, and turns it around.  The movie doesn\u2019t just explain monsters are not real, but takes it in a more creative direction by showing that just because monsters appear scary, does not mean that they are scary creatures.  The movie shows monsters as nice, caring, and funny creatures.\rMonster\u2019s Inc. brought in a $34 Million into the box office, and scored a 3.8/5, according to the movie rating website, Rotten Tomatoes.  The average viewer takes into consideration, the skit, voice-overs, character\u2019s appearance and every last detail.  Every viewer should, at least, walk away with a new view on monsters and a laugh.\rThe originality of this movie is unlike any other.  Monster\u2019s Inc. uses what children fear most, monsters, and make them seem like harmful creatures.  This movie puts the imaginations of these young kids and has them look behind appearance and what they expected.  Monster\u2019s Inc. expresses a new idea in their growing minds and opens up their thoughts to see that appearance is not always what it seems and to take a look on the insides, because you cannot judge without getting familiar with somet",

Now, for the main characters- Sully and Mike acts as best friends throughout their jobs, they show cleverness to entertain viewers in a way of humor. Especially, Roz, who appeals using her slow-paced talking and reminding the paper work assignment of Mike in a hilarious silent way.\r Monsters Inc. is really a great time if you are bored, it can entertained you because the characters are charismatic and joyful which makes the film feel alive. And they even not stop entertaining till the credits, they showed that the film is real and the characters worked as Hollywood actors and even mentioned \"No monsters were harmed in this film\", really a diversion of realism that can caught adult's attention to watch it. Even my aunt loves this movie even she's 27 years old.\r Monsters Inc. is a good film and look it even won Academy awards. It may not seem as fresh as the Toy Story film but outstanding packed humor and realism makes it sufficient enough to be added to PIxar's success in the animation universe.\r Rating: 9  10",

Monsters, Inc. confirms what every child really knows - the things that go bump inRemember when, as a child, you used to fear the monster under the bed or in the closet - how your parents would tell you to go to sleep, that it wasn't real? Monsters, Inc. confirms what every child really knows - the things that go bump in the night have more substance than silly grown ups recognize. Brought to the screen by the marriage of Disney and Pixar, Monsters, Inc. is the fourth computer animated motion picture offspring of this union. Like its older siblings, Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc. is a triumph of storytelling. Each new movie of this sort raises the bar a little more, and, while Monsters, Inc. doesn't eclipse Dreamworks' Shrek, it comes close.\r There's a world out there, somewhere under the rainbow, where monsters live. The sprawling city where they go about their daily lives is called Monstropolis - a vast, bustling place populated by all sorts of misshapen creatures who would cause the average human child to crawl under the covers. Energy in Monstropolis comes from an unusual source - the screams of children. Employees working for mega-corporation Monsters, Inc. go through gateways into the bedroom of human kids on Earth, frighten them into screaming, capture the energy from the screams, and convert it to electricity in Monstropolis. But, since children are becoming harder to scare, Monstropolis is facing a \"scream shortage.\"\r Everything that was true of the two Toy Story movies and A Bug's Life can be said about Monsters, Inc. - this is the kind of movie that works on multiple levels - as fast-moving, lively fun for children and as slyly written, visually impressive entertainment for adults. Monsters, Inc. is one of those rare family films that parents can enjoy (rather than endure) along with their kids. And childless individuals venturing into a theater showing this picture need not worry that they'll be viewed as deviants - Monsters, Inc. is capable of drawing audience members from across the age spectrum.\r The older the viewer, the more in-jokes they'll get. Most everyone will appreciate the \"Don't Stalk\" street sign and the tabloid newspaper called \"The Glob\". But it will take someone with a little more sophistication than the average 10-year old to get a chuckle out of the club named \"Harryhausen's\". From a visual standpoint, Monsters, Inc. is a small step forward from Toy Story 2 in its variety, richness of design, and background detail. I say a \"small step\" because Toy Story 2 was strong in all of these areas - Monsters, Inc. is just a little better.\r The great strength of the previous Pixar films, as well as Shrek, is that they offer a genuine emotional component that runs deeper than that of the run-of-the-mill animated feature. Such is the case here, where the attachment between burly Sulley and tiny Boo touches the heart. Part of it is because the animators have pulled out all the stops in making Boo shamelessly cute, but it does the job. The little girl brings out Sulley's soft side and smoothes some of Mike's rough edges. (As in Shrek, the animators opt to make the human characters somewhat \"unreal\", rather than going the Final Fantasy route and attempting to replicate actual human appearance.)\r Monsters, Inc. manages to last 90 minutes without a single song. Too often, music has become a crutch in animated productions (rather than the asset it can be when used appropriately). The fact that Monsters, Inc. doesn't need Randy Newman songs sprinkled throughout (although there is one during the end credits) is a testimony to the strength of the writing and the vocal characterizations. John Goodman and Billy Crystal make for an effective odd couple (in a break from tradition, they recorded their parts together, rather than separately). James Coburn is suitably dignified as Henry J. Waternoose, the owner of Monsters, Inc. Jennifer Tilly lends her helium-like voice to Celia, Mike's girlfriend; Steve Buscemi is hardly recognizable as the diabolical Randall; and Mary Gibbs' baby-talk makes Boo all the more adorable.\r Monsters, Inc. reaffirms the fact that a good animated film can be every bit as stimulating and emotionally satisfying a motion picture as a high quality live action endeavor. While this movie may threaten to be swamped by Harry Potter mania this fall, it definitely deserves to be seen. Young Mr. Potter may practice magic, but Monsters, Inc. is nothing short of enchanting.",

Pivoting on the novel idea of monsters as genial working stiffs who scare kids just for a living, pic is clever and jokey in a vaudeville sort of way.\r Not measuring up to Pixar\u2019s usual level, artistically or financially, is no disgrace; the outfit\u2019s three previous features have grossed a combined $1.2 billion worldwide, and the Bay Area operation has quickly built up a reputation for consistency in the kid pic realm perhaps equaled only by Disney himself in the 1940s and \u201950s. Still, \u201cMonsters\u201d is noticeably more relentless, frantic and noisy than its predecessors, as well as less charming and captivating. Nor does it come close to rivaling \u201cShrek\u201d as the standout animated picture of the year.\r Pacey item centers on the team of Sulley and Mike, the top \u201cscarer\u201d and \u201cscare assistant\u201d in Monstropolis, a town dedicated to and powered by the screams its professional monsters provoke from Earth\u2019s young children. A towering, horned, purple-and-green-haired bear of a creature, Sulley (voiced by John Goodman) is the proverbial softie inside a hulking exterior, and he\u2019s encouraged, prodded and provoked at every step by the literal ball of energy that is Mike (Billy Crystal), a lime on legs distinguished by one giant eye and a motor mouth.\r Great fun is had laying out the basic contours of Monstropolis life: Beasts of every imaginable shape, size and configuration report daily to a giant factory to scare the bejesus out of kids everywhere, who are accessed via portable doors that magically provide direct entree to their bedrooms. Air tanks instantly capture the resultant screams, the energy source for the entire city.\r Workaday banter, friendly joshing, office romances and professional rivalries are effortlessly laid out, with Sulley\u2019s status as every child\u2019s worst nightmare challenged only by Randall (Steve Buscemi), a purple, multi-armed lizard who covets the popular Sulley\u2019s rank and enjoys the extra advantage of being able to turn invisible at will. Other colorful characters imprinted instantly and engagingly on the mind include Mike slinky, snake-haired receptionist girlfriend Celia (Jennifer Tilly), the crotchety office overseer Roz (Bob Peterson) and the old-school, crablike big boss Waternoose (James Coburn).\r Dramatic gears are set in motion when a tiny girl named Boo (Mary Gibbs) slips through her door from the human world into Monstropolis. However fearsome they can be when called upon, monsters have a paralyzing fear of contact with homo sapiens, whom they\u2019ve been taught are highly toxic if touched; an entire organization, the Child Detection Agency, staffed by emergency personnel in sealed yellow suits, exists for the sole reason of dealing with such intruders.\r Knowing what will happen to Boo if she\u2019s caught, and quickly suspecting that physical contact with her isn\u2019t so dangerous after all, Sulley and Mike protect the pig-tailed kid, a pre-verbal imp whose utterances sound like those of a Teletubbie on speed and who is, unfortunately, not the most endearing tyke ever put onscreen. In fact, she\u2019s pretty obnoxious, which doesn\u2019t help during the film\u2019s longish midsection that\u2019s mostly devoted to the monster team\u2019s frantic efforts to hide Boo from everyone else. Much of the film, then, becomes a cat-and-mouse chase, with distractions offered by the smoothly malicious plottings of Randall and an amusing digression when the duo is momentarily banished to the Himalayas, where they are enthusiastically welcomed by a boisterous Abominable Snowman (John Ratzenberger).\r But as the chasing about continues, it becomes increasingly apparent how insufficiently the premise has been developed; the excellent basic ideas have yielded too few twists and dramatic junctures to keep the picture flying at the level at which it starts. The climactic roller-coaster ride pursuit \u2014 on tracks in the giant warehouse where the portals are kept \u2014 provides some sensory thrills, but the poignant note on which the story ends forcibly reminds the audience of the genuine emotional chords the film has previously failed to strike.\r Pixar\u2019s vast army of design personnel has hardly been asleep at the wheel, as the monsters and settings overflow with imagination and wit. Even when the narrative becomes a bit tedious, there are visual and verbal references to keep adult auds amused; little kids may be scared at times, but in a reasonable, unthreatening way. In ways that viewers may now begin to be taking for granted, the computer animation here is still incredibly impressive.\r \u201cMonsters\u201d is preceded on prints by a jolly three-minute Pixar trifle, \u201cFor the Birds.\u201d",

Meanwhile Mike bottles their screams and uses them to provide power for the monster world's every need. It's nothing personal - - it's just clock-punching employment. Or it is until a little girl they christen Boo (Mary Gibbs) manages to cross over to Mike and Sulley's dimension.\r If the monster world authorities find her, the boys are going to be out of a job and Boo's going to be detoxed out of existence since monsters are convinced that kids are poisonous. Will Mike and Sulley get Boo safely back to her own world? Can Monstropolis survive without the power of kiddie screams? What is evil Monsters, Inc employee Randall (Steve Buscemi) up to? And is Mike ever going to successfully date medusa-haired Monsters Inc receptionist Celia (Jennifer Tilly)?\r Flawlessly animated, Monsters, Inc glows with loving care and attention, but talking about the quality of the CG work is akin to watching The Godfather and rambling on about how all those flickering single images successfully create the illusion of movement. It's Pixar's storytelling and not the technology that makes their films fly.\r Goodman's deep rumbling tones turn Sulley into the most huggable of huge, furry critters - - his slow-burn realisation that Boo may not be the lethal killing machine he's always believed human kids to be is simply joyous. And while Sulley's the heart, Crystal's furiously ad-libbing Mike is the lippy, fast-talking brain, pumping out one-liners to compliment the sight gags and slapstick. It's the classic buddy movie combo of big 'n' loveable and small 'n' sarky.\r But Monsters, Inc is much more than just a framework to hang jokes on. The humour works as part of a thumpingly good narrative that finds time to slot in a truly creepy villain, some serious tension and two belting action sequences. Not to mention a big soppy ending that sends you out into the night with the warmest of hearts.\r It's not quite up to Toy Story 2, but it doesn't fall that far short. Monsters, Inc stakes an early claim to this year's family entertainment crown - - it'll take something truly spectacular to beat it.",

Or it is until a little girl they christen Boo (Mary Gibbs) manages to cross over to Mike and Sulley's dimension.\r If the monster world authorities find her, the boys are going to be out of a job and Boo's going to be detoxed out of existence since monsters are convinced that kids are poisonous. Will Mike and Sulley get Boo safely back to her own world? Can Monstropolis survive without the power of kiddie screams? What is evil Monsters, Inc employee Randall (Steve Buscemi) up to? And is Mike ever going to successfully date medusa-haired Monsters Inc receptionist Celia (Jennifer Tilly)?\r Flawlessly animated, Monsters, Inc glows with loving care and attention, but talking about the quality of the CG work is akin to watching The Godfather and rambling on about how all those flickering single images successfully create the illusion of movement. It's Pixar's storytelling and not the technology that makes their films fly.\r Goodman's deep rumbling tones turn Sulley into the most huggable of huge, furry critters - - his slow-burn realisation that Boo may not be the lethal killing machine he's always believed human kids to be is simply joyous. And while Sulley's the heart, Crystal's furiously ad-libbing Mike is the lippy, fast-talking brain, pumping out one-liners to compliment the sight gags and slapstick. It's the classic buddy movie combo of big 'n' loveable and small 'n' sarky.\r But Monsters, Inc is much more than just a framework to hang jokes on. The humour works as part of a thumpingly good narrative that finds time to slot in a truly creepy villain, some serious tension and two belting action sequences. Not to mention a big soppy ending that sends you out into the night with the warmest of hearts.\r It's not quite up to Toy Story 2, but it doesn't fall that far short. Monsters, Inc stakes an early claim to this year's family entertainment crown - - it'll take something truly spectacular to beat it.",

Well, my personal taste differs a little, there are some other films from this studio that I prefer and that I like more (Inside Out, Up and Wall-E are some of them), but that is a matter of personal taste and not properly a matter of merit. It's a great movie, worth watching as a family.The script couldn't be better: the film takes us to a world parallel to ours, where the monsters of our childhood nightmares live. They have found a way to get in and out of our world through a machine, and harness the energy of frightened children's screams to generate electricity for their world. Sullivan and Mike are two monsters who share a good friendship and work together on this task, with Sullivan holding the record for scariest monster. However, things get out of hand when a human child ends up entering the world of monsters (they think children are toxic, and they poison everything they touch) and become very fond of the two friends, who now need to get rid of her.The film has a very good cinematography, full of color, light and movement. The digital animation is excellent, creative, original (the details are the key to understanding the originality of the whole set) and very well done. As is the hallmark of this studio, very good actors were chosen to voice the various characters, starting with John Goodman and Billy Crystal. I also liked the participation of Steve Buscemi, who gave life to the villain, Randall, and Jennifer Tilly also deserves praise for her work here. The soundtrack, honestly, didn't add that much to the film, in my opinion, with the exception of a few occasional jazz tones.",

All computer animated films looked aThe best computer animated film of them all, and the most adultUntil now I couldn't bring myself to believe that computer animation was the equal of either stop motion animation or hand-drawn animation. All computer animated films looked a little (usually more than a little) too sterile, many were animated poorly (\"Antz\", \"Shrek\", \"Final Fantasy\"), and even the single unqualified success (\"Toy Story 2\") provided little evidence that a computer animated film COULD reach the heights other kinds of animation could. \"Toy Story 2\" had flawless character animation, but nothing as inspired as the best in \"Tarzan\" (released the same year, although I could have chosen almost any other Disney cartoon to make my point); effective art direction, but nothing to match \"Fantasia\" or \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\". And I thought that \"Toy Story 2\" was as good as the art was ever going to get.I was wrong. This is far better. And what's more, there's no sense whatever that the script (an unusually rich and uninhibited script) is bumping up against the limits of what the medium will allow. It's now been proven that computer animation CAN be just as good as any other kind. Whether it will be allowed to be in future is another question, but for now, I'm hopeful. What we have here is computer animation's first ENTIRELY unalloyed artistic delight, with every character gracefully and characteristically animated, every virtual set just right and pleasing to look at, and an eye-tickling mastery of colour, light and shade that I thought would forever elude CGI artists.It's not fair to judge anything good as \"Monsters, Inc.\" as though it were a children's movie, but I can't resist comparing it with \"Shrek\" - which emphatically IS a children's movie. \"Monsters, inc.\" is admittedly ABOUT children, in a sort of a way. The inhabitants of Monstropolis rely on children's screams for their energy, and the central story is kicked off when one of the monsters accidentally brings a small child (which he calls \"Boo\") into the city. But we never see things from her point of view. We see things from the point of view of the monsters, who are all adults - and who, like most adults, see children as frightening, almost incomprehensible members of another species. And they ARE. To be sure, Wazowski comes to feel strong affection for Boo, but she never becomes more than a humanoid pet (which is not to demean the relationship). This is a story about adults looking at childhood from the outside.\"Shrek\", of course, is a children's movie through and through. Its attention span is short, it has an unthinking mean streak, and children will have a whale of a time watching the central characters (the bigger they are, the more fun it is) act childishly and make poo-poo jokes. \"Monsters, Inc.\" has too much genuine wit, characters too rich, a world with too much depth, and a story at once too coherent and too complicated, to be PRIMARILY a film for children. This is not to say children won't like it. Maybe they will. (Who can say?) Here's the bonus: if they DO like it, it will (unlike \"Shrek\") actually have a beneficial effect. It will make them less frightened of the dark.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nMy first ever exposure to Monsters, Inc. was when we had gone to McDonald's and I got a Mike Wazowski toy. I was really scared of it, and my sister used to often scare me with it. Little did I know that Mike is supposed to be the comic relief of the movie. Later on I saw the trailer, and eventually the whole movie. And now I can say with a guarantee that Monsters Inc is one of the better Disney movies. Sure there are some things I didn't like (which I will talk about later) but other than those things, this is absolutely perfect.One thing I really like about Pixar is that they always take one thing we like from our lives and then expand it into a full blown story. You play with toys? There's Toy Story. You like fishes and the ocean? There's Finding Nemo. You like cars? There's...well, Cars. So similarly over here we were all afraid of monsters coming into our rooms when we were sleeping alone as kids, and that's what this movie is based on. Unlike the conventional monsters who want to kill us, these monsters are working for a power company who just use children's screams for powering up their world.The story revolves around Sullivan and his best friend Mike Wazowski, who work at Monsters, Inc. Sully is a professional scarer while Mike collects the screams from the children. However, there is one rule that the monsters must abide by - children should not learn about their world otherwise they will no longer be scared and the monster world will run out of energy. Things go down very badly when Mike and Sully find out that Sully accidentally brought a little girl named Boo back to their world. Meanwhile Randall, the second best scarer and Sully's rival, is making a scream extractor which will help him extract the most screams and make him the best employee.The movie is twenty years old and still the world shown here is very dynamic even by today's standards. The third act where Sully, Mike, Boo and Randall are jumping from one door to another was very cool. The animation is also very good, especially the fact that every single hair on Sully's body is distinguishable, and all the pores on Randall's body can be seen. The comic timing is also great, like the part where Randall says, \"Say hello to my scream extractor!\" and Mike immediately says \"Hello.\". And also the part where Sully thinks Boo got crushed so he faints just as the emotional music starts playing.Now like I said, there are a couple of things I didn't like in this movie, which is what stopped me from giving it a perfect score. First of all I really liked Randall. He was my favourite character in the whole movie. He looks cool, his superpowers are admirable and he's stronger than he looks. But he still loses to humans. First with Boo, who is literally a child who can't even speak. And then by grown humans who beat him with a broom in the end. It would have been better if he got stuck in the middle of nowhere like he made Sully and Mike do so. And the second thing is the part where they are in Nepal. That was boring to say the least.Monsters, Inc. is one of those movies that can be enjoyed by both children and adults. It is very rare for a Disney movie to be that way nowadays, so it can be revisited back even today. Like I said, its animation has aged very well, which is why it is so much fun to watch it without feeling something is off. And it has a sequel too, something it took me too long to learn about. I really liked it compared to most movies Disney has been making nowadays.",
