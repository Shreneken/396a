    "In the Mood For Love is ravishing beyond mortal words.",
    "Probably the most breathtakingly gorgeous film of the year, dizzy with a nose-against-the-glass romantic spirit that has been missing from the cinema forever.",
    "Wong weaves a spell that no other director could create.",
    "There may be no more sensual director in the world today than Hong Kong's Wong Kar-Wai.",
    "The sexiest movie of the year.",
    "The film is alive with delicacy and feeling...It's a beauty.",
    "This enthralling, enigmatic, romantic drama from Asia's most influential auteur (Chungking Express) is an essay in appetite and inhibition.",
    "Smolders with more reserved passion than \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\"",
    "It is undeniable in its poignancy, an ecstatic vision of what might have been, though as much for its story as for the fact that the whole thing dissolves like a paper fan in rain, an evanescent masterwork.",
    "The result is a kind of ultimate romantic film, joining an almost Jamesian sadness and discipline to that extraordinary visual sensibility. It's not the kind of thing you see every day.",
    "A wondrously perverse movie that not only evokes a lost moment in time but circles around an unrepresentable subject. Mood is the operative word. A love story far more cerebral than it is emotional.",
    "It's a masterpiece, a sublime tone poem that shows what cinema is capable of when it tries to do more than just tell a story.",
    "A love story told from the point of impact, at the heart, and no conventional resolution could be more profound.",
    "Although In the Mood for Love isn't in the mood for action, it dazzles with everything but.",
    "It's extraordinarily sexy: The atmosphere is all cigarette smoke and Nat King Cole songs, silk suits and tight sheath dresses.",
    "A stylistic tour de force, one that wordlessly emotes and wears its emotions on its literal silk sleeves.",
    "Wong denies us the satisfaction of resolution, but in sharing his mastery of cinema, and his gift for conveying mood, desire and vivid emotions, he's more than generous.",
    "The story gains most of its dramatic impact from superbly understated acting and Christopher Doyle's atmospheric camera work.",
    "The most ingenious device in the story is the way Chow and Su play-act imaginary scenes between their cheating spouses.",
    "In the Mood for Love has novelty value, I suppose, and plenty of pretty camera moves, but it's not really a movie you can warm to.",
    "A stylistically fastidious, exasperatingly affected package that will put most people in the mood for slumber."

In just over 90 minutes, it conveys, through a voyeur-like cameras eye and spot-on, often silent, acting from Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung, an intensity of locked-up longing that's perhaps never been so captured on screen. The leads' spouses are having an affair, which brings them together unwittingly, though they too live in neighboring apartments. Initially joined by mutual heartbreak, they become joined by shared desire for one another that, in 1960s Hong Kong, is verboten. The leads are never joined through plain expression, but rather in often tense, mannered, scenes where they share a space (e.g., a cab) and communicate through just a glance or movement. And, in these scenes, the camera latches on to their subtle gestures with a yearning of its own that brings slight, soft acting full circle, giving it clear meaning. The leads encounter one another, repeatedly, in somewhat scripted, yet somehow not contrived, terms. An encounter might involve bumping in to a neighbor running a common daily (or nightly) errand. Indeed, an encounter of this sort becomes a centerpiece of the film, and the subject of perhaps the most entrancing visual sequences put to film in recent decades. In the Mood for Love is about quiet but telling action that, when enveloped by the camera, becomes loud. Wongs rich visuals tug the viewer into a muted world wrought with emotion. A feat many directors aspire toward. A feat Wong executes to perfection.",

The main tension comes from the fact that things will inevitably change and the question is whether these two people, who seem to deserve more out of life, can get it without becoming undeserving themselves.

Chow and Sus spouses are often away on foreign travels due to their jobs which eventually leads to Chow and Su becoming more and more lonely. After numerous coincidental meetings in the neighborhood a conversation occurs and the news editor and secretary realizes the kinship of their situations. One night Chow invites Su to dinner confiding her in his suspicion about their spouses having an affair. Su admits that she's had similar thoughts, but none of them has any solid evidence. Their intimate conversation gradually turns to regular dinner meetings where these two modest individuals find a unifying chemistry, and in time a subtle romance comes to life.\r The two leading characters are portrayed as introverted, somewhat static and well educated people with high morals, and brought to life through Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung's low-keyed and emotionally demanding performances. Wong Kar-Wai wants us to emphasize with our hero and heroine even though we are aware of the fact that they are about to commit the same deception as their spouses have done. That one feels emphatic towards Chow and Su is hardy unavoidably considering what they are coming to terms with, but Wong Kar-Wai's real masterpiece is that he has us sitting through most of the film wishing for the main characters to become lovers. The esoteric dialog is convincingly communicated and Shigeru Umebayashi's theme song \"Yumeji's Theme\" is like a hymn to Chow and Su's tranquil and romantic friendship.\r \"In the Mood for Love\" is a film that lives on it's on terms and invites the viewer into a dreamlike, poetic and hypnotically beautiful universe. It's without clichÃ©s, filled with hope and contains lyrical shades that makes the film seem like one great love poem or an exploration of human behavior affected by love.\r This unforgettable slow-moving tale from one of the greatest visual storytellers in modern cinema stands alongside \"The Piano\" (1993) as one of the most profound love stories i've ever seen.",

As a result, director Kar-Wai Wong's moving film touches onA truly melancholy yet poignant experience, In the Mood for Love is a truly devastating look at those on the other side of infidelity. Yet, at the same, purely and subtly romantic. As a result, director Kar-Wai Wong's moving film touches on themes of adultery, marriage, and love, as these two people try to cope with the way in which their lives have been destroyed. Blessed with good cinematography, good acting, and a great score, In the Mood for Love is a wonderful work that really hits home.\r After moving in next door to one another, Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung) discover that their spouses are having an affair with one another. What plays out is them imaging their spouses' spending time with one another, as well as them imagining confronting their adulterous partners. Unfortunately for them, their spouses heavy travel schedule leaves prevents any of these interactions from actually taking place, thus leaving them in eternal limbo as they await their returns. As expected, the two fall in love and spend more and more time with one another, but repress their emotions to keep up appearances. By the film they are willing to move on their love, time has passed and they simply can no longer because together as life has brought them extenuating circumstances.\r A decidedly melancholy film steeped in themes of respect and loneliness, In the Mood for Love only subtly pays off on its hinting at the main characters' love. Though Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan certainly hit it off and love spending time with another, the film goes out of its way to showcase the two of them maintaining their purity and not becoming their spouses. Instead, they hold themselves back and keep on just being friends. Wong does great at capturing this element as the romantic tension and longing between the two shines through in large part to the camera work and acting.\r In the Mood for Love is incredibly slowly paced, which allows for the full emotional impact of their trauma and regrets to really linger with this audience. Even more, this slow, methodic pacing almost becomes wholly melodic and poetic as Wong weaves his way through this relationship, the crumbling of their marriages, and their later attempts to reconnect but to simply be kept apart. In particular, the discussion of the old method of hiding secrets and then seeing Mr. Chow do exactly as he described while in the ruins of Cambodia is a truly moving and poetic ending to the film. Yet, incredibly subtle and restrained, as is the case with Wong's characters. Plus, this scene does a great job capturing larger topics in the process. it was not just our two protagonists whose lives changed, but also all of Hong Kong. As hinted to at the end, Hong Kong has changed dramatically since they met four years prior to the end of the film. Not only have their former landlady's moved out, but times have changed and people are moving on. The fact that Wong chose to end the film in Cambodian ruins is also attached to this element, considering it is a very visual representation of the way in which time moves on and leaves destruction, ruins, and memories in its wake. The camera work in this final sequence is particularly moving as it moves through these Cambodian ruins as Mr. Chow visits them.\r Ultimately, Kar-Wai Wong's In the Mood for Love is a truly tragic exercise in heartbreak, repression, and loneliness. Though these two may love one another, they simply cannot allow themselves to express this in the conservative Hong Kong. If they did, it would be the end of them socially. Thus, they remain silent. Wong does a tremendous job capturing their chemistry even in silent moments and developing his characters, as well as their relationship. Wholly authentic, In the Mood for Love is a film that may be very slow, but it is a truly melodic and poetic experience.",

Personally, I find it not only incredibly difficult to go through but also is left in awe with the structure of the film. Probably, because there isn't any. Dashing across the film, the script tells a story from a third person's perspective. In a sense that the fable is narrated to him or her, as a memory shared in the form of highlights. Now, this sort of writing has always inspired me. Something that you can see majorly in Pawel Pawlikowski's Cold War. Often, while writing such a material, you are under sheer pressure to not boast off about something inessential to the storyline and also not make the events loud enough to give away the trajectory of these characters.Walking that fine line, comes a nuanced vocab, that the writer and director, Kar-Wai Wong is speaking flamboyantly. Not, for a split second does he give away its essence beforehand. And plus, this format of jumping forward with an uneven pace, helps the maker create a jarring impact on you that is soothing despite of the poignancy that it breathes perpetually, there was always very little window for these characters to peek through and almost impossible to go through.As Evan Puschak observed so smartly in one of his sort-of-reviews, the film is majorly shot with a frame within a frame tone, that helps us dive into the \"observer\" theme instantly. Plus, the enactments of these characters for their supposed situations, is just pure fun where later on, the slow-motion montages nail the final nail in the coffin expressively. It would and should provoke everyone to be In The Mood For Love, since it first and foremost is about the evolution of a friendship; innocent I find this world.",

And In the Mood for Love is definitelyThank god I postponed watching this movie until I am in the right..... mood! ♥♥♥♥I always wandered how a WKW film would be, if it was less focused on atmosphere, and more concerned about its narrative. And In the Mood for Love is definitely this movie. The plot of this movie is more cohesive than of the other Wong Kar-wai films.The rest of his films don't have a conventional plot, but rather disjointed beautiful and hypnotic sequences that allow emotions to flow through them. This is not the case here. In the Mood for Love still doesn't have a linear narrative in the traditional way, I mean it's still a WKW film, but the movie has a more contained narrative to say the least.Unfortunately, the movie didn't hit me emotionally as much as it should. Don't get me wrong, I was moved by the movie even more than every WKW I've watched so far, with the exception of Chungking Express. The issues I had with Days of Being Wild and Fallen Angels are what kept me from being fully emotionally engaged, but as for In the Mood for Love, it's the over-control upon the movie's story that deprived me from being entirely connected emotionally. It may sounds strange, but that's what I felt, and in all probability that's what many people also feel if they have been already familiar with Wong Kar-wai style.I don't want to seem as if I'm just creating problems, or make some flaws up out of no where, but I felt that some emotions and feelings passed quickly without hitting me hard.On the other hand, having control on the narrative aspect of the movie, Wong Kar-wai's poetic visual style became more mature. You can easily identify his trademarks, which the movie is full of them; playing with the time, using elliptical editing, and repeating songs, but they are utilized in a more beneficial and purposeful way, hence more delicate and exquisite way.Even the beauty of the cinematography is different from those of Wong Kar-wai's other works. Here the beauty comes from the sumptuous colour palette more than anything else. In the Mood for Love is unquestionably one of the best movies in cinematic history in terms of using colours. The colours here set the mood, and keep enriching it throughout the film's fleeting runtime.However, the characters of this movie along with the performances are the real pleasure I got from. All the subtlety of the characters are brought out by a magnificent cast. Tony Leung Chiu-Wai is quite possibly one of the most talented actors ever. His performance is simply ingenious. Maggie Cheung is equally terrific, if equally, perhaps marginally inferior in comparison Leung, but it's her character that astonished me. Unlike Days of Being Wild's Su Li-Zhen, this character her is jaw-droppingly multi-layered. And the way the brilliant script delves into her is just mind-blowing. Every time Leung's character, Chow, shares the screen with her unravels a new layer in her character, while showcases the talents of the two lead, especially Leung's unique gift.The masterful combination of the ingenious symbolism of Wong Kar-wai, and the movie's sprawling and elaborate narrative is what makes In the Mood for Love stands out, either from Wong Kar-wai's oeuvre, or from the Romance genre. In the Mood for Love is undoubtedly worthy of being hailed as Wong Kar-wai's masterpiece, but Chungking Express is still my favorite among WKW's cinematic gems.(8.5/10)",
