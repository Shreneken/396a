    "critic_reviews": [
        "Glitter is the week's only major Hollywood release, and it offers considerable escapist entertainment while hitting an affirmative note.",
        "And above all, the film is lacking in joy. It never seems like it's fun to be Billie Frank.",
        "Glitter is, if nothing else, comfortable with what it is, namely earnestly made, wholehearted schlock.",
        "This is the worst performance by a pop star in a dramatic role since Madonna suited up for \"Shanghai Surprise.\"",
        "Helplessly clich\u00e9d, predictable and unaware of its own lameness, it could easily become a camp classic on the order of \"Grease 2\" and \"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\"",
        "We don't have much space to tell you about Glitter, so we'll be blunt. This star vehicle for singer Mariah Carey is primarily a showcase for her breasts.",
        "\"Zis is not verking! Zee glitter cannot overpower zee artist!\"  That, in a          sentence, sums up what is wrong with this picture.",
        "Glitter, the kind of movie only 11-year-old girls who dot their i's with hearts would find bearable.",
        "It touches on universal themes of love, friendship, and family. Suffice to say it falls dreadfully short.",
        "Even the soundtrack doesn't rescue the movie from its tedious banality.",
        "It doesn't help that Glitter is such a derivative mishmash of cinematic and real-life situations that it's nearly impossible to count all the ways.",
        "It's doubtful that even a real actress could have triumphed over the rusty tinsel of Glitter, a hapless, retro-'80s ''Star Is Born.''",
        "A butt-numbing exercise in tedium, sporadically redeemed by moments of unintentional hilarity.",
        "A heart-wrenching debacle from the starting gun.",
        "Just when you think it could not get more ridiculous, Hall, Lanier, and Miss Mariah go that extra mile.",
        "Glitter deserves yet another title: \"A Star Is Dull.\" As phony a vehicle as one could possibly concoct for a wannabe movie star, pic carries Mariah Carey into a swamp of gloppy melodrama.",
        "Mostly dross, an unintentionally hilarious compendium of time-tested cinematic clich\u00e9s that illustrates the chasm between hopeful imitation and successful duplication.",
        "I desperately wanted Glitter to be trashy and over-the-top, to be so courageously awful. As it is, it isn't nearly bad enough to be that kind of good. It's simply there, all dressed up with no place to go, and that's the most damning thing you could say about it.",
        "Assure Patient, who has paranoid delusions about Jennifer Lopez being molded into the new M______ C_____, to rest easy because Lopez has never made a film as bad as Glitter.",
        "Worst movie of the year."

The big problem is that she didn't learn her acting skills. That just happens with Glitter. It's not only that bad, but I hated this crap of a movie starring a rags-to-riches performer who wants to be a star. Big deal. The movie was atrocious, stupid, nothing special when this film came out. Even worse, it's from the director of 2Pac's final movie \"Gridlock'd.\" Anyway, Glitter is totally the worst movie ever before Catwoman and FYI, the story is terrible. As many of us might say \"All that glitters is not quite actually gold.\"  Go ahead and buy it on the bargain bin, but stay away from Mariah 's acting and that horrid DVD cover (much like the poster itself). Showgirls, look out!",

It essentially follows Mariah Carey around in a series of loosely related events. She's one of the most wooden actresses I have ever seen. Due to the confusing direction, I thought this was a biopic at first, but it's actually a vanity piece set in the 80's. The scenes transition with - you guessed it - glitter. Go figure. This movie was released in 2001, and Mariah Carey blamed September 11th for its failure. The real reason is that it's painfully bad.",
