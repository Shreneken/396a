  "title": "Ocean's Eleven",
  "rating": 8.6,
  "release_date": "2001-12-07",
  "summary": "In this remake of the 1960 Rat Pack heist movie, Clooney plays Danny Ocean, a man of action attempting to orchestrate the most sophisticated, elaborate casino heist in history.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "It's a scrumptious and dizzy-spirited lark, a what-the-hell-let's-rob-the-casino flick made with so much wit and brains and dazzle and virtuosity that the sheer speed and cleverness of the caper hits you like a shot of pure oxygen.",
    "Soderbergh's film will be remembered less for the (inspired) star casting than for being one expertly made piece of pure, unpretentious popcorn entertainment.",
    "Forget Oscar, Ocean's Eleven is the coolest damned thing around.",
    "One thoroughbred of a movie. Sleek, well-muscled and brisk, director Steven Soderbergh's newest offering delivers just about everything anyone could possibly want from filmed entertainment -- except deep thought.",
    "If the new Ocean's Eleven is mostly Clooney's show, he's more than up to the task of carrying it. Indeed, this could be his career-defining role: The twinkle in his eye has never seemed more disreputable, his devil-may-care charm has never seemed so appealing, and he dominates the movie with the graceful ease of a Golden Age Hollywood star.",
    "The most purely entertaining movie to come out of Hollywood so far this year, and if that doesn't seem worthy of Soderbergh's talents, it's worthy enough for a night's amusement.",
    "The movie, in a very real sense, is about the privilege, the sexiness, of being a movie star. Certainly it isn't about the heist; never was.",
    "A champagne bubble of a movie, lively, effervescent and diverting. If it bursts earlier than we'd like -- and it does -- that takes nothing away from the considerable pleasure it provides along the way.",
    "Soderbergh rallies a seismic jolt of enthusiasm, and the movie is an elating blaze of flair and pride.",
    "Together, they (Clooney and Gould) threaten to sneak off with the movie when Soderbergh isn't looking, sowing madness and sex appeal in their wake.",
    "An all-star remake of the all-star original, Ocean's Eleven is a lark for everybody concerned, including the audience. Breezy, nonchalant and without a thing on its mind except having a little fun.",
    "Soderbergh won't hit the Oscar jackpot with Ocean's Eleven, but he has come up with a stylish winner.",
    "It's a kick, it's a gas, and it gives the Rat Pack itself a run for its money.",
    "In her byplay with Clooney, Roberts only occasionally strikes a spark. Clooney, on the other hand, generates heat.",
    "A caper that rarely goes wrong.",
    "It's not deep for a second -- indeed, it repels depth deliberately as if allergic to it -- but it's as swell a swell time as grown-ups could want at the movies.",
    "Serious pianists sometimes pound out a little honky-tonk, just for fun. That's like what Steven Soderbergh is doing in Ocean's Eleven.",
    "Soderbergh -- helms a much tighter and arguably cooler film --  even if the only thing audiences are likely to remember about this Ocean's Eleven is that, while they were watching it, they enjoyed it tremendously",
    "Soderbergh and writer Ted Griffin added plot twists that will catch you off-guard, dumped the clever ending and worked in a love story that's as superfluous as elevator shoes on Shaquille O'Neal.",
    "Good, expensive, easygoing fun. It's no masterpiece, but why should Soderbergh --  or anybody -- get three in a row?",
    "There's no joy and little playfulness about this caper comedy, which, despite a lighthearted script, has a sober undertone to it, almost a melancholia.",
    "This time, the actors don't seem to be making up the movie as they go along, and they're guided by a gifted director who has earned the right to have some guileless fun.",
    "The movie tells you right up front you're going to get what you came for: big stars, winking inside jokes and a spin on something so familiar it doesn't matter that you don't buy it for one minute. You're not meant to.",
    "The movie is mechanical, but machines can be elegant, even inspired.",
    "The movie is slick and studiously cool -- with plenty of visual flourishes but not too much soul.",
    "Despite dashes of droll dialogue from screenwriter Ted Griffin, the remake aims for cool but instead gets chilly.",
    "Sure, like cotton candy: It doesn't do a thing for you, but it's wickedly sweet as it melts on your tongue.",
    "Too bad it commits the crime of being so intensely average, because what could have been sensational turns out to be merely this week's heist movie.",
    "A pretty good caper comedy for 11-year-old boys -- \"heist thriller\" would make it sound too ambitious.",
    "Doesn't offer much."

First off, the cast lives up to the hype. Whenever a film manages to get so many great actors together, you know you are in for something interesting and that is exactly what this one delivered. In addition, the entire robbery sequence was very intriguing and kept you on the edge of your seat as it was happening. Every character really brought something to the table and in spite of there being so much competition for screen time, it never felt overwhelming in that respect. The thing this film really has going for it, without a doubt, is the banter between Clooney and Pitt. The comedic elements brought to the table by the both of them really helped make this into one of the funnest films I have watched in a while.\r I am not typically a huge fan of Soderbergh's films, but this one worked well, however there were some negatives. Of course Don Cheadle's accent was...indiscernable. I do not want to comment on whether his accent was good or not, but at times, it was tough to understand what exactly he was trying to say. In addition, I had a tough time sitting here and believing that Julia Roberts was the most attractive and talented actress they could have cast for a role that emphasized her attractiveness. There has to be someone more attractive than her who was interested. Seriously.",

I'd like to think that this is very much in similar to RianStart the car at your own risk, the getaway driver has another place to be.Ocean's ElevenSoderberg's smoothest and underappreciated trilogy started from this standard chapter. I'd like to think that this is very much in similar to Rian Johnson's films. In the sense that the plot is incredibly thick and easily flamboyant in any circumstances it faces, as a result the storyline flips, turns, detours and shoots straight before reaching its destination. Now if a viewers isn't in sync with the on going gag or banal plans, the final product might come off quite textbook. Now, I don't know whether the script is written with such reverse engineering in mind or is always up for investing on engaging flim flams.The director Steven Soderberg has created history for me while making this trilogy. There have been plenty of multi-starrer films as such but none of them went by as swiftly as this one does. And the trick he uses is not to keep these characters linked scene by scene and instead the object that serves the objective. And then, face changes, agendas changes, plan changes and the team changes but the objective stands tall.Despite having an incredible cast, Brad Pitt and George Clooney are mostly standing ahead in the queue. And why wouldn't they, their repartee, between a huge heist going down, about little thing is what makes it rain in this night. The small talks, the actual talks, the bone and not the meat of the material comes when Pitt and Clooney is waiting for something. Kind of like they are in between reality and fantasy, the past and the future, where they stand in present solving an entirely different solution. Almost as if that window is for you to see, not for the characters or even any other viewers, just for me. Ocean's Eleven isn't actually the name they came up with, it should have been called The Benedict Job, I mean they all agreed to it.",

Even though Soderbergh's charm and the drama between the team holds up as rewatchable entertainment. It's a cool film, but lacking personality at times which the follow-up films have in spades.  It's still a solid outing, and probably the most consistent and iconic tonal film of the trilogy. Not a classic, but it poses as one.",

It's a very light film, made for entertaining, with an improbable but fun plot, full of moments of intelligent humor that look good in the movie. In addition to Clooney, who has done here one of his most popular works, we have Brad Pitt, Bernie Mac, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia and Julia Roberts among others. Clooney and Pitt stood out for the positive, being able to amuse and to make humor without losing the charm of their characters or overshadowing the colleagues. The story is relatively simple but allows almost all actors to have room to appear. And although I said the story is unlikely, the biggest problem of the script for me was the love trio Clooney-Roberts-Garcia. The idea was good, but it did not work out because Julia Roberts never seemed very willing. The romantic chemistry between her and her two colleagues was zero and I ended up thinking about what the actress really thought she was doing in the movie. Andy Garcia has already made more inspirational performances but was decent enough on his character. The scenarios are very good and realistic, from the safe to the gaming rooms, and the great sights of Las Vegas are truly beautiful and look good on the screen. The soundtrack is great and stays in the ear.",

The script is very witty and funny, and packs many surprises and some fun characters along the way. The ending is unexpected but still makes sense at the same time. The script messes with your brain, makes you get all the possible solutions and still be wrong. The cast is very good and the sets are fantastic, especially the duplicate bank vault scene. While it definitely is slow for the first half and the editing is choppy in some places, that doesn't disguise a brilliantly made second half of the film.",

This is what Ocean, released from prison, is aiming for. Plan the shot with a friend of his. Specialists in every field are recruited, the best ones. The casinos belong to a single owner, certainly Tony Benedict, very organized and, if it happens, very cruel. We also learn that Tess, Ocean's ex-wife (but he's always very much in love) is with Benedict. For Ocean it would therefore be a double revenge. The robbery succeeds: super-technological. And the reconciliation between Tess and Ocean is also successful.A nicely made movie of light entertainment.",
