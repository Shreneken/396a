  "critic_reviews": [
    "Ghostbusters is one of those rare movies where the original, fragile comic vision has survived a multimillion-dollar production.",
    "Ghostbusters is a hoot. It's Murray's picture, and in a triumph of mind over matter, he blows away the film's boring special effects with his one-liners. Spotting a lusty, totally transformed, fire-breathing Slgourney Weaver, whose body has been overtaken by a spirit, Murray walks past her saying, \"That's a new look for you, isn't it?\" Thank you, Bill. And don't get outta here, you knucklehead. We like you in this kind of movie.",
    "Whoever thought of having evil's final manifestation take the form of a 100-ft. marshmallow deserves the rational mind's eternal gratitude. But praise is due to everyone connected with Ghostbusters for thinking on a grandly comic scale and delivering the goofy goods, neatly timed and perfectly packaged.",
    "With his deadpan delivery and snide quips, Murray more than holds his own amid the myriad state-of-the-art special effects.",
    "Although it reunites the comic talents of director Ivan Reitman, writer Harold Ramis and star Bill Murray, the team responsible for the Meatballs phenomenon, their style here is far more laid-back and relaxed. There are still plenty of laughs, but not of the frantic sledgehammer variety.",
    "Within the top-heavy cast, it’s Murray’s picture, as the popular comedian deadpans, ad libs and does an endearing array of physical schtick.",
    "However good an idea it may have been to unleash Mr. Murray in an ''Exorcist''-like setting, this film hasn't gotten very far past the idea stage. Its jokes, characters and story line are as wispy as the ghosts themselves, and a good deal less substantial."

A movie like that would probably not be greenlighted today. The strengths are the awesome cast which has fun playing the roles, the director, humor and the mixture of comedy, fantasy with some science fiction elements. It creates a world that is fully believable and entertaining. Also it gets the mixture of seriousness and humor right in a way that non harms the other. It is the story of the 3 parapsychology scientist Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz and Egon Spengler (later joined by Winston Zeddemore) who investigate paranormal activities. Because this field of science is not taken serious and seen as fraud they are thrown out of their jobs at the university and are discredited. Because of this they start a business called Ghostbusters. They use their knowledge and technical skills to develop tools / equipment to locate, capture and contain ghost. Of cause there is more to it as paranormal activities are on the rise. I stop with the set up here. The story might sound a bit silly but works fully. Maybe the start is a bit to slow for my taste but it introduces the characters well. The rest is a great story with an epic climax. It is one of the most well know movies of the time. The humor is awesome and is carried by the cast and script. The actors have a great chemistry together and so it is natural that the demands for a new movie and the franchise are still strong. They created something that is a timeless classic. Lets continue with the strong cast. We have Bill Murray as Peter Venkman. Must I even praise him? He made so many wonderful performances in his career and this is one of the best of them. He is a charming trickster and master of persuasion. Then we have Dan Aykroyd as Ray Stantz. He is the noble scientist with a hearth of gold. Harold Ramis as Egon Spengler is the smartest scientist of the group. He has also some dry humor. Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore has less screentime in this movie but fills it with a really good performance (They say that the role was for Eddie Murphy and was cut down when he was not available but other say this was just a rumor). These 4 Ghostbusters are pop culture icons and legends. This performance laid the foundation for the franchise. It ends not here as we got even more great actors / actresses. There is Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett with a great performance. She is a legend in the industry and one of my favorite actresses. Then we got Rick Morranis another one of my favorites. He has also so many good performances including this. Sidenote: I wondered why he made no movies after becoming a big star. His wife died and he quit his career to raise their kids. He is such a great man. There is Annie Potts as Janine Melnitz who is often forgotten, has a smaller role but fully delivers. Finally I want to mention Ernie Hudson as Walter Peck. He has a memorable scene and says he was mocked by / for the nickname he was given in this movie;-). A truly remarkable cast. All characters work well and I consider it a true strength. I praise also the clever written script by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and of cause the director Ivan Reitman. Without these it could also not be a cult classic. The special effects were amazing for its time but aged a bit badly. Still has some scary scenes. Then there is the humor which is another strength. There are a lot of good jokes, memorable quotes and scenes. I must also praise the music. The Ghostbusters song by Ray Parker Jr. has also become a classic and is still sometimes played today in the radio. Heard it so many times but still enjoyed it. Overall this is a childhood favorite I still enjoy as adult. A cult classic that earned its place in movie history. Even after all the years it has so many fans. One of the easiest recommendations I can make for movies.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nAh yes, Ghostbusters. One of the classics that came from the 1980’s, I’m sure it was a time considered by many to be a great decade. This movie has been seen by audiences and plenty of critics alike as one of the greatest comedies ever made. And, seeing as there is a new Ghostbusters movie coming out soon I feel it would be fitting if I looked at the two films that came before. Does it meet the expectations I hoped for, or am I going to have the unpopular bad opinion? Well, let’s go into detail.\r The film centers around scientists of various degrees of credibility, Ray Stanz (Dan Akroyd) the person who is always energetic about what he does, Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) the logical one who doesn’t have much emotion and has his eyes always focused on science, and Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) the sarcastic one who’s not afraid to say what he thinks. All of them, after being kicked out of teaching in university decide to start a business centering around catching the paranormal and see what makes them tick. At least, that’s what I assume why they keep all of them in a secured container.\r You also have Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett who requests the Ghostbusters help to discover the strange occurrences happening in the apartment building that she lives in. Little does anyone know about what events are about to unfold.\r First thing I like to say is that the soundtrack is nice, the various songs that play throughout the entire movie I’m sure it hasn’t left the mind of some people currently reading this. It really is a thing of beauty to listen to. The special effects too, especially for the time look very good. It has aged quite a bit though, especially with the party scene with the monster what wrecks everything. I rarely had a feeling that he was actually there chasing Louis Tulley (Rick Moranis) at all.\r Oh yeah! The characters, let’s talk about that part. The chemistry between our trio of scientists is pretty funny, Murray, Akroyd and Ramis certainly know how to work off each other and be able to provide comedy that made me chuckle when it happened. Not surprising, since both Akroyd and Ramis were also writers of the script as well. If I remember from research, Akroyd too worked on Saturday Night Live at the same time that Murray was in the cast. So I had no doubt that they could make a concept like this work very well. When Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) arrives on the scene later on, they waste no time in giving him time to develop and work with the other cast. Every character in this story, main and supporting alike, manage to make a story about capturing ghosts possible.\r Even with all this, there are a few things holding me back from giving the film a very high score. For starters, some of the science in this thing isn’t exactly logical. I’m not talking about that ghosts can never happen; I have no issue. It’s things like how can something like a proton pack actually scientifically work? I don’t think protons work like that! There are also a few minor scientific licenses they used. 300cc of what again? That would kill someone, not put them to sleep! I guess Dana's right, Venkman's not a scientist!\r This is going to sound odd, but I was a bit disappointed that I didn’t laugh as often as I should have. They clearly written a lot of stuff that should have made me visibly laugh, but all I did was chuckle every now and then at most of them. I only laughed out loud once, and that was when they used the packs for the first time on a maid’s cleaning cart. Her reaction after the blasts stopped was golden! I wished I could have laughed more often, but I suppose that’s my problem, not the film in that regard.\r I really don’t want to upset anyone who thinks of the film as a masterpiece, but it’s really a good film. I promise that! I just think that it isn’t perfect. That is all.",

I thought it was funny, imaginative and entertaining, and I do completely agree it is underrated. I really liked the soundtrack, and the special effects were truly excellent, considering it was made in the 1980s. The direction was slick and self-assured, and there are a lot of truly funny lines in the script like \"Ray, if someone asks you if you are a god, you say yes\". I can't count the number of times I was laughing when I watched this film. The performances were brilliant. Bill Murray, who is excellent when he is given a great script, see him in Lost in Translation for evidence, steals every scene he's in, and Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis both gave spirited performances. Also fun to watch were Annie Potts and Rick Moranis, and Sigourney Weaver was her usual charming self here. I will confess when I first saw this I was frightened by the dog like creatures Zuul and Vinz Clortho. I also felt that scenes like the Marshmallow Man (or whatever it was) bit got a bit too silly, but hey, it's all part of the fun.

It is about a group of scientists who are failing at their current job and decide to open up a business for catching ghosts after many ghost sightings have been heard about in New York.The main reason this movie stands out is the characters, most notably the Ghostbusters themselves. They feel like real people and the reason for that I believe is because most of their lines were made up by the actors as they went along and in real life people make up what they say as they go along which adds a sense of realism. Bill Murrary absolutely steals the show; he's funny, his character is likeable and feels real. All of the characters have great portrayals and all tell good jokes but Murray is the stand-out of the lot.The movie may seem like it's aimed at kids with all of the ghosts and whatnot but it actually has lots of adult jokes and is actually aimed more at older viewers.There's something about nearly all movies made around this time which makes them so special- many of them are so simple yet so effective. Many of the outstanding movies nowadays are those which contain complex storylines but are very good (like The Dark Knight) but it's great to see how great these older movies can be by having such a basic premise.I also need to note that the pacing in this movie is great- everything progresses quickly and never comes to a halt.I couldn't really find many issues with the movie but I do have a few. They aren't major but they are minor things I would like to point out.Winston, even though I like his character, feels like he's just 'there' and doesn't really add anything. This is probably because he is introduced later on so he kind of feels slapped in and isn't really necessary.Even though I like the final act (the fight against the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man), it feels a bit short and only lasts a couple of minutes. I'd like to have seen it cause more chaos.Also, it might just be me but it kind of ends rather abruptly. Usually in a movie, the final act goes down and then there's a final scene clearing everything up. In this it's like the credits are playing over that final scene. Imagine at the end of Star Wars (spoilers for the first Star Wars even thought you probably already know the ending), imagine the credits start rolling as soon as the Death Star has been destroyed and they are playing over the award ceremony scene. I mean, it's not like anything needs clearing up at the end of this movie but it's a bit different to other movies.Overall, this is a great movie with great characters, great dialogue and humour and also very good pacing. I would highly recommend this.8/10",

      "content": "In this film, the protagonists are four paranormal fanatics who decide to join forces and create a company specialized in removing ghosts of New Yorker's houses. The boss is Dr. Peter Venkman (played by Bill Murray), an parapsychologistIn this film, the protagonists are four paranormal fanatics who decide to join forces and create a company specialized in removing ghosts of New Yorker's houses. The boss is Dr. Peter Venkman (played by Bill Murray), an parapsychologist little crazy and deeply sarcastic. He's assisted by Dr. Egon Spengler (embodied by Harold Ramis), the intellectual genius of the quartet, Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Winston Zeddmore (played by Ernie Hudson). In this film, they have to win Gozer, a demonic entity that will try to use Dana (Sigourney Weaver), a girl who Venkman tried to conquer, to achieve it's dark aim of destroying the world.We're facing, probably, one of the most iconic comedies of the eighties. Bill Murray, who could already consider himself an experienced comedy actor, reached an exceptional level, dominating this movie and toasting the audience with deeply ironic and irresistible laughing moments. The result was Murray's launch to stardom, as one of the best comedians of the eighties cinema. Another actor that was highlighted was Rick Moranis, who plays Mr. Tully, one of the funniest characters in this film thanks to Moranis enormous talent. The film has a number of very good special effects, probably the best of his time, a time when special effects knew how to be in a movie without dominating it. The soundtrack is also a very positive aspect of this movie, with the \"Ghostbuster's\" song topping the Billboard Hot 100. This song is still known to the general public presently.This film should be one of the comedies that more money earned over during the eighties. And it's not difficult to understand why: it's a movie for everyone and appeals to children the same way as the elderly. It's very curious that a film whose many critics said so bad manages to keeps it's popularity today, thirty years after being released.",

Well, I’m sorry to tell you guys, but your favorite movies are no less repetitive and self-indulgent than the modern ones you seem to hate. Yes, some movies were good in the past. A lot of them also CREATED the same tropes you complain about in modern movies. You just grandfathered them in because they were the ones YOU liked. This movie is filled with horrible motivations for characters (the same people who are “appalled” by the behavior of men in Hollywood seem to love ALL of Bill Murray’s roles that play that exact archetype) and characters that talk a lot and really manage to say nothing of importance. Egon at one point proceeds to explain how, if their current amount of ghosts were a Twinkie, his “ new data” (never explained) shows that they would have a 35 foot long, 600 pound Twinkie on their hands...so in a round about way he said they have a lot more ghosts to worry about...but he said it with a metaphor that had science words so it sounded like he said something smart...seriously, this movie is just made by a bunch of coke head actors, yet you all treat it like some “scientific” take on ghosts. Saying things that you heard in your high school science class doesn’t mean you know what you’re talking about...or that you’re saying anything that correlates to actual fact. If you like a movie, GREAT, enjoy it! Don’t pass yourself off as an objective critic, though, because you **** keep convincing me to watch these overrated 80s movies simply because you were all in elementary when they came out. Or that’s when you first saw them, at least. 7/10",
