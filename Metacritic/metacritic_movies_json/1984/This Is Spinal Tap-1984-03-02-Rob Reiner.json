  "summary": "Spinal Tap, one of England's loudest bands, is chronicled by film director Marty DiBergi on what proves to be a fateful tour.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The rock scene hasn't been the same since this hilarious 1984 comedy.",
    "One of the funniest, most intelligent, most original films.",
    "Deserves an encore anyway for its invaluable contributions to the vocabulary of rock'n' roll and pop culture.",
    "Screamingly funny. Few films, if any, can match Spinal Tap for consistent laughs. Every scene is a classic.",
    "80 minutes of total joy, its momentum utterly uncompromised, every single second an invitation to snort uncontrollably. I can hardly wait to watch it again.",
    "The greatest laugh-out-loud comedy of the 80s.",
    "This Is Spinal Tap is virtually guaranteed to appeal to nearly everyone. The film contains everything from laugh aloud moments to scenes that will have even the most dry, humorless viewers smiling with unrestrained mirth.",
    "This is Spinal Tap is hilarious to everyone who’s not a musician. Because for as ridiculous and perverse as Rob Reiner’s heavy metal mockumentary gets, the slim, 82-minute comedy gnaws at more truths than any other rock ‘n’ roll biopic ever put to celluloid.",
    "There are too many classic moments in this film to possibly count, and I won't even bother trying to quote lines or describe gags.",
    "Time hasn't dulled the agonising richness of the songs, the toe-stiffening stupidity of the on-stage concepts, or the endless pith of Tufnel and St Hubbins' wisdom. Even if you've seen it an unhealthy number of times, have another go.",
    "Reiner's brilliantly inventive script and smart visuals avoid all the obvious pitfalls, making this one of the funniest ever films about the music business.",
    "A towering achievement in cinema, music, and life art. Funnier and more prescient every time I see it.",
    "A heady flow of brilliant stupidity.",
    "So intensely funny that the viewer must hang on every word: comic gems spill forth almost continuously.",
    "Spinal Tap is still on the right side of the fine line between stupid and clever.",
    "A vastly amusing satire of heavy metal bands.",
    "One of the great movie satires. And if it isn't the funniest rock spoof ever made, it certainly shares the title with \"The Rutles.\"",
    "''It's such a fine line between stupid and . . . '' ''And clever,'' muse the band members collectively. It certainly is- and the delightful This Is Spinal Tap stays on the right side of that line.",
    "The group's members come off more like real musicians than parodists.",
    "For all its japes and jokes, the movie is really about exhaustion of the spirit: sitting in a bleak hotel suite at 4 a.m. with the bad taste of last night in the mouth and the feeling that tomorrow will not be a better day.",
    "It's no wonder young musicians say they learned to be rock stars from This Is Spinal Tap. It came to satirize and stayed -- and stays on -- to celebrate.",
    "Hilarious pseudo-documentary spoof of a British rock group that was so on-target in its satire, many viewers took it for the real thing.",
    "The material is consistently clever and funny.",
    "Begs the question: Did the lads from Squatney trail the zeitgeist at every turn, or were cobandleaders David St. Hubbins and Nigel Tufnel simply in touch with their past and ahead of their time?"

Anyone who has ever been in a band will relate to the struggles of Spinal Tap as they try to release their newest album. Rob Reiner really hit this one out of the park. The cinematography is great.

As mocking and cutting as the movie, it still manages to express show the genre some love. My favorite moment is when David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), playing and singing on stage, urges Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest) with a nod of his head to come out of the wings and join him on stage. Nigel had quit the band in disgust after David's meddling wife had attached herself uninvited to the band. Nigel hesitates but then walks across the stage, straps on a guitar and plays in unison with David. It's a special moment in a special film.",

The writing is funny and brilliant, but fails to keep it true to its nature and fumbles its way down the road. There are few hilarious sequences installed in here that one cannot not get lost into it. Another major dilemma in here is that the priority in here is nothing but the punch line of the joke which is kept above the bigger picture in here and fails to make a definite point out of it. The performance is promising and hilarious at the same time, as they draw plenty of laughs from the screen. Rob Reiner; the director, is bang on the money on his execution skills and is convincing throughout the course of it. The music bits of the feature may come off, off putting and uneven in here. This Is Spinal Tap is a gentle yet insulting tap on the back in its self-created genre as it fails provide the essential ingredients to it and leaves it undercooked.",

The problem I find with many comedies is that they are not as funny as I want them to be, but here, that is anything but the problem. From the interactions between the band members to the lyrics in their songs, the comedy never stops here and really, you barely have time to recover between jokes. All of the band members, Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer, are hilarious and turn in strong performances to boot. Rob Reiner is great here as well, as are Tony Hendra, June Chadwick, and then I really liked Bruno Kirby's small part as well. The fact that much of the dialogue was ad libbed makes this one even better and really helped to make it feel so natural. Spinal Tap is obviously not a real band, but it truly felt like it was at times since the interviews and interactions felt so natural and authentic. In every way imaginable, This Is Spinal Tap is a classic comedy from the 80's that is worthy of the praise it has received over the years.",

The film stars Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer as the main group members. What surprised me most about this film is that most of the films dialogue was improvised by Reiner, McKean, Guest, and Shearer. It works quite well throughout the film, as the jokes feel more organic and not staged. There's not much else to say about \"Spinal Tap\". It's a really clever movie that's modestly executed and it, in all honesty, pays off. While, it's not a solid eleven (ha ha see what I did there?) in my book, it's still a freaking hilarious movie.",

From how loud the amps can go to the story about how their drummer spontaneously combusted, pretty much everything is some kind of a joke.

It's certainly an 80s film and it obviously has a strong 1980s feel to it - the brand being very much portrayed as an '80s hair band.It's kind of ludicrous in an excessive parody kind of a way but its also very much a good bit of silly fun. It looks like everyone enjoyed making the film, from what you can tell and that somehow makes watching it more enjoyable too. I hadn't realised (until I read the credits) that it was co-written by Harry Shearer (who does various Simpsons voices). The 'philosophical 80s rocker' (surely that's a contradiction in terms?) is a new one on me but there you go!. This is, I believe, a cult classic and certainly I thought it was an enjoyable parody film, in the same way as 'Airplane!' is a very good parody, or send up, of disaster films. I would definitely recommend this film, primarily for fans of 80s rock and roll/hair band groups (Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Van Halen etc.).",
