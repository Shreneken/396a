  "summary": "After losing a powerful orb, Kara, Superman's cousin, comes to Earth to retrieve it and instead finds herself up against a wicked witch.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Director Jeannot Szwarc could have done more with the action scenes, but he has a snappy sense of pace and comic timing. Blond, blue-eyed Slater brings an engaging sweetness to Supergirl; and she plays Linda with an awkward, gawky girlishness, subtly different from her Supergirl role.",
    "Helen Slater is a find: blonde as Supergirl, dark-haired as Linda Lee, she’s an appealing young heroine in either guise. Screenplay is filled with witty lines and enjoyable characters, but Jeannot Szwarc’s direction is rather flat.",
    "Most delightful of the Super-series for its good-natured disregard of narrative considerations.",
    "The gift of Christopher Reeve, in his best scenes and when the filmmakers allow it, is to play Superman without laughing, to take him seriously so that we can have some innocent escapist fun. Helen Slater has the same gift, but is given even less chance to exercise it in Supergirl, and the result is an unhappy, unfunny, unexciting movie.",
    "Supergirl arouses some initial curiosity about the differences between the two cousins; for instance, that Supergirl can't change in phone booths and is much the better flier of the two. However the film, as directed by Jeannot Szwarc and written by David Odell, quickly loses its novelty.",
    "Slater not only makes for a dull Supergirl, but she's stuck in a clumsy, silly film that tries for the light touch of Richard Lester's Superman II and fails decisively.",
    "If Superman was an eagle streaking across the sky, Supergirl is the result of that eagle’s bowel movement.",
    "Jeannot Szwarc's direction is flat and uninspired, emphasizing the jokey elements without any sense at all for the material.",
    "Queasily suspended between drag theatrics (Faye Dunaway and Brenda Vaccaro camping it up on a soundstage replica of a carnival spook house) and Spielbergian wholesomeness (Canadian Helen Slater as a toothy, Aryan Ubermadchen), this is one comic-book feature that doesn't fly."

Embrace the camp and nonsense and you will find a charming and surprisingly stylish tale of a young women discovering what she is capable of.",

Le film n'est en tout casUne distribution de premier plan pour ce film \"Supergirl\" même si les vedettes n'y font que cabotiner et se ridiculiser éhontément... et pour la gamelle sans doute ! mais tout de même...  il y a des limites à tout. Le film n'est en tout cas rien moins qu'un épouvantable nanar qui cumule bêtise, maladresse et premier degré inexpugnable : impossible donc d'en rire (ou d'en sous-rire, même en soldes).Il faut dire que si la cousine de Superman est une blonde absolument ravissante, elle n'en reste pas moins écervelée, tellement écervelée qu'elle pourrait jouer dans une télé-réalité. Quoi qu'il en soit, elle est venue nous faire un petit coucou imprévu parce que là d'où elle vient, c'est tous des branques cousins consanguins de Régis, Rainman (l'autre super héros) et Forrest, Forrest Gump (encore un super héros). Du coup, il ne faut point s'étonner de ce qu'elle trimballe, la pauvre... mais sur Terre, elle a trouvé d'autres débiles à qui parler : tout s'arrange !Evidemment, à l'origine, il ne s'agissait pas d'un navet mais bel et bien d'une grosse production... cependant, elle a bien mal vieilli et cette baudruche de film atteint les confins du ridicule très ridicule, les repousse même, toujours plus loin... Pensez à l'inviter à dîner un mercredi, ça pourrait être intéressant.",
