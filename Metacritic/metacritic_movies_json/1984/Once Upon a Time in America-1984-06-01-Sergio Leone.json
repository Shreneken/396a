  "summary": "A former Prohibition-era Jewish gangster returns to the Lower East Side of Manhattan over thirty years later, where he once again must confront the ghosts and regrets of his old life.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "A film of fatally flawed heroes, oversized passions, nation-building, and, inevitably, violence, America follows its characters from childhood to old age by way of the kind of grand-scale filmmaking that wouldn't be seen again until Martin Scorsese's Gangs Of New York. [2014 re-release]",
    "An epic poem of violence and greed.",
    "While The Godfather delivers certainty and a comforting dramatic resolution, Once Upon A Time In America delivers a profound kind of mystery. While Coppola's film delivers answers, Leone's asks questions. It lingers and plays on the mind; its meanings shift and change like a faded memory or a half-remembered dream.",
    "A brilliantly detailed Lower East Side Jewish version of The Godfather.",
    "Watching the film takes some patience. You have moments where there's 10 seconds or more of silence in between dialogue. When it gets violent, it's not the psychotic glee we're used to from Quentin Tarentino and his acolytes, it's simply the way things were in that life, unvarnished and brutally honest.",
    "A film as epic and rich as Sergio Leone's imagination, Once Upon a Time in America sits at the head table of gangster movies.",
    "This epic is a compendium of kitsch, but it’s kitsch aestheticized by someone who loves it and sees it as the poetry of the masses. It isn’t just the echoing moments that keep you absorbed—it’s the reverberant dreamland settings and Leone’s majestic, billowing sense of film movement.",
    "This is Leone's gangster film to end all gangster films, a work of tremendous intellectual depth and emotional range.",
    "Once Upon a Time in America paints a portrait of the United States as a land of shadows and violence, yet one that nevertheless has an irresistible, romantic pull. [2014 re-release]",
    "Although substantially shortened for its United States release, this violent drama still has the feel of an epic, as director Sergio Leone explores the seamiest byways of urban Americana through the story of two gangsters who start their partnership as Brooklyn kids in 1921 and tragically end it in the late '60s. Yet the story has gaps and many of the incidents have a flatness which suggest deeper flaws than cutting and trimming probably account for. [U.S. theatrical release]",
    "As a magnum opus, Once Upon a Time in America falls just a few point tragically shy of greatness.",
    "Once Upon a Time in America remains the most “problematic” of Leone’s major pictures. It is enveloping, operatic and slightly mad. We can forgive the confusion and the non- synchronised dialogue. But to this day the misogyny remains indigestible. [2014 re-release]",
    "While Leone's vision still has a magnificent sweep, the film finally subsides to an emotional core that is sombre, even elegiac, and which centres on a man who is bent and broken by time, and finally left with nothing but an impotent sadness.",
    "Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America has the mind of a dazzling art film and the soul of a TV mini-series.",
    "It's a collection of occasionally vivid but mostly unfathomable incidents in which people are introduced and then disappear with the unexplained suddenness of victims of mob murders. [U.S. theatrical release]",
    "Once Upon a Time in America arrives as a disappointment of considerable proportions. Sprawling $32 million saga of Jewish gangsters over the decades is surprisingly deficient in clarity and purpose, as well as excitement and narrative involvement.",
    "This would-be epic schlep, dragging almost 50 years of chronology over a sluggish 140 minutes, is far too slight of text and ponderous of presentation to sustain more than nodding-off dramatic interest. [U.S. theatrical release]"

However it has dated pretty poorly. Set during the 20s, 30s and 60s, it looks far too much like a 1980s film, which it is.The score (composed by Ennio Morricone, who is a genius) belongs in a romance film, not a misogynistic gangster film where the men routinely assault and objectify women. It also has a very 1980s sounding version of \"Yesterday\", which is laughable.The characters are unsympathetic and unremarkable, giving you no reason to root for Robert De Niro's character as he returns to his old neighbourhood for revenge.Easily the worst film of Sergio Leone's catalogue.",

Me talking about this legend will not do justice to his legacy. With over 520 credited scores, it is a life worth lived. Every single one of his scores are so uniquely distinct, and yet fits so perfectly with the genre it's based on.Some of the best written music ever, such as: 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', 'The Untouchables', 'Once Upon a Time in America', 'The Mission', 'The Hateful Eight', and 'Days of Heaven'. Of course, not forgetting 'The Thing', with its two beats sounding like a heartbeat, but like an alien trying to imitate a human heart in order to blend in. Super eerie.Also, the Razzie Awards don't know **** when it comes to movies. For those who do not know what I am talking about, let me briefly explain. The score for 'The Thing' was nominated for Worst Score at the ceremony. Like...what!?Even if you haven't seen the movie, you would most certainly heard one of his scores. You just cannot escape it; it is that timeless and instantly recognizable. A titian has left the building.Rest in power, Ennio Morricone.",

It is amazing, a true milestone in the crime drama genre. The cinematography, images, scenery and locations are all superb and quite sweeping, while Ennio Morricone's score ranks up there with his very best. While the film clocks in at nearly four hours long, it never feels boring to me while the pace is quite elegiac everything else just compels you. I will admit, this is another film you need to see more than once to understand/appreciate it.Sergio Leone's direction is also superb, the story is always compelling and rich and the dialogue is very thought-provoking. The characters are wonderful if different. Unlike The Godfather(not a bad thing by the way), Once Upon a Time in America doesn't make you feel sympathy for its characters, these characters are actually quite nasty people but the way they are written and acted makes them compelling too. The two rape scenes are very shocking and perhaps brutal, but again that's no flaw in any way, because this slant on crime and the like is quite realistic if you put it in perspective.The acting is another strong asset. Robert DeNiro and James Woods, both are great actors, and both give brilliant performances. So overall, extraordinary, not only of its genre but of film full-stop. 10/10 Bethany Cox",
