        "But the most stimulating, satisfying aspect of this action fantasy is the theme music.",
        "Its dazzling special effects make its combatants flip and fly, spin and soar, all the while punching and kicking each other like jackhammers, only to leave viewers utterly unmoved.",
        "Pic consists largely of choppily edited fight scenes (usually involving somersaults and back flips) combined with various computer graphic effects.",
        "It would miss the point to complain that the plot is nonsensical drivel peopled by paper-thin characters and a paucity of ideas.",
        "This tedious hodgepodge of martial-arts mayhem, bogus mysticism and computer-generated special effects doesn't even pretend to have a plot.",
        "Fragmented and monotonous, without a semblance of the gymnastic cleverness that at least made the first Mortal Kombat film into watchable trash, Mortal Kombat Annihilation is as debased as movies come.",
        "This film has no story, no characters, and no coherence.",
        "Here's the lowdown on the latest chapter in Mortal Kombat: deadly dull.",
        "The movie is nothing more than a perpetual chain of elaborately choreographed (by returning star Robin Shou) fight sequences that mix live-action foregrounds with complexly layered digital effects and are linked together by the most flimsy and laughable of plot elements.",
        "It's cynical and it's depressing, and I would lock a child in a room before I'd show him Mortal Kombat: Annihilation."

You do realize it's a martial arts movie based on a friggin video game, right? The martial arts scenes (most of the point of the film) were excellent. The choreographer did one of the best jobs I've seen in a m.a.'s movie in a long time. They actually got actors that could fight, instead of \"pretty faces\" like in the first edition (a movie which I also liked).

We get goofier performances, worse dialog, and uglier special effects. The plot goes into a bunch of mystical mumbo jumbo. It tries to go grander in scale than it's predecessor, but it all just leads to poorer writing.\r We still get the entertaining fights though. The movie definitely doubles down on the fan service. Just like the first movie it's strength is in watching the game characters fight each other with over-the-top action. These fights are backed up by an awesome soundtrack.\r It tries to go bigger than it's predecessor and ends up falling short as a result. It also gets quite a bit cheesier. However when it's focusing on the first movie's strengths (cheesy martial arts action with fan favorite MK characters) it's still pretty entertaining. The expanded roster of characters taken from the games still makes it worth a watch for fans of the series and of the first movie. The lack of R-rated fatalities is still a disappointing non-inclusion, but no more so than it was in the first. Overall the movie just isn't as good this time around.",

Don't buy it, matter of fact, don't rent it on Blu-Ray.

Even the best actors /actress cant get much out of an awful script or a bad role. What troubles me the most are the sparks of good ideas in this movie. With adaptations and improvements you could make a better or even good movie out of the setting and some ideas. Then there are the fights. While I admit that the final confrontation is engaging the total performance is disappointing. It is sadly not even \u201cSo bad that it is good\u201d. That would at least improve the rating.
