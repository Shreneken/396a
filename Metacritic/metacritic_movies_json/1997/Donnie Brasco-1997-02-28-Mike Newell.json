    "critic_reviews": [
        "There are moments here that are so distinct in emotional timber it's as if they were directed by someone who'd skipped the last two decades of American genre film and opted to get back to basics -- like character, and the ways in which two actors can sit in a smoke-filled car and turn an everyday conversation into art.",
        "The true soul of the New York mob is portrayed in Donnie Brasco, a first-class Mafia thriller that is also in its way a love story -- perhaps director Mike Newell's best.",
        "It's hard to think of another American film with this range of moods: satirical, sometimes hilarious, yet suffused with a sense of loss and riddled with the kind of violence that makes you recoil and lean forward simultaneously.",
        "One terrific movie... Pacino and Depp are a match made in acting heaven, riffing off each other with astonishing subtlety and wit.",
        "It's the electric interplay between Pacino and Depp that will make it a Mob movie classic.",
        "Crackling good... the best crime movie in a long while.",
        "You wouldn't mistake Donnie Brasco for a great movie or an important one, but it's something that's become almost as rare in American movies: a consistently absorbing and intelligent adult entertainment.",
        "This is Depp's coming-of-age role, and he's terrific. Pacino, who's shown more flash than substance recently, reminds us how great he can be when he loses himself inside a character. The bond between these two makes the film sing.",
        "The violence in this movie is gruesome (a scene involving the disposal of bodies is particularly graphic). But the movie has many human qualities and contains what will be remembered as one of Pacino's finest scenes.",
        "What better casting than Al Pacino, whose own career, of course, has reflected all the seasonal changes in the gangster saga. Pacino takes the part and runs with it so boldly that he ends up in Arthur Miller land.",
        "This sort of story has been told many times before, but thoughtful performances by Al Pacino and Johnny Depp make it more engrossing than expected.",
        "Perhaps the most impressive thing that Newell has done with Donnie Brasco is to cull an atypically low-key and introspective performance from Al Pacino, an actor known for manic, scenery-chewing efforts.",
        "Depp conveys his character's ambivalence and ambiguity with utter conviction, and though the annoying score tries to throw Pacino's monologues over the top, his persuasive, low-key performance puts the violins in their place.",
        "The psychological dimensions of the story remain underrealized, but the loaded central premise and intimate focus the film sustains combine for a very involving and dramatic piece of crime lore.",
        "Depp's tight, guarded performance is almost painful to watch, and Newell seems to have reined in the flamboyant Pacino, whose portrait of the mobster as a grumpy old woman may be his best work in years.",
        "It\u2019s [Depp's] first genuine \u201cadult\u201d role (not counting the tedious Nick of Time), and it allows him the freedom and emotional range to move, speak, and deal with issues more as an actor and less as a brat-packer.",
        "Because the filmmakers have skewed the story into a Donnie-Lefty lovefest, the breakage of their trust signals the breakage of Donnie's spirit even in triumph. Case closed. It's the kind of fade-out we might expect from the it's-all-hopeless era of '60s counterculture movies. It's emotionally effective, but also a cheat.",
        "Unfortunately, the story isn't inventive and Newell's methodical approach to it verges on monotony.",
        "That bland, opaque quality is a disadvantage here; whatever else [Depp] is capable of, making audiences feel his pain is not at the top of the list.",
        "The movie\u2019s disappointingly straightforward, with no discernible flair."

Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, and Michael Madsen, are all fantastic in this one. Ultimately, this one is a gangster film that does a really good job developing the characters and making them all very human. By the end, you can see why Depp's character is going through the things he is and the conflict he is facing. In addition, though you know Pacino and Madsen are bad men, you feel a ton of sympathy for them. That is a key to the success of many films and this one completely nails making us care and feel for the characters, no matter how bad of a person they may be. In addition, the development these characters go through in two hours is great and feels like a good representation of the true story behind this one. My only complaint here was the beginning, in which the development happened at the snap of a finger and seemed a little rapid and unlikely. I feel like they probably skipped over some information there, which is too bad. However, as a whole, this one is very good and a good depiction of what really happened minus some small inaccuracies. A great showcase for the talents of Depp, Pacino, and Madsen, for sure.",

It's a perfect way to capture the ruggedness of the steel girders, the grandeur of the East River, and the magnificence of the city's world-renowned skyline off in the distance, all in a single sequence.However, one must also consider that the bridges serve a more symbolic purpose.  Donnie--an undercover FBI agent--successfully infiltrates the Bonanno crime family, and in doing so slowly transitions from an upstanding G-man into a gangster.  Thus the bridges are also used as a metaphor--a way to physically manifest his crossing over from good to bad.'Donnie Brasco' does so many of the big things right, not least of all Al Pacino's extraordinary performance.  But it's the little things that make the film endlessly re-watchable, and I'm happy to have discovered another detail that can be added to the list.",

The film follows a young FBI agent (Johnny Depp), as he manages to infiltrate a mafia faction through one of its veteran soldiers, Lefty (Al Pacino).\rThe growing bond between Pacino and Depp's characters plays out beautifully, with both leads giving subtle and low-key, but brilliant performances. The dialogue is witty and sharp, and delivered near-perfectly by the vast majority of the cast.\rOne element of the film that wasn't so effective was the subplot involving Depp's deteriorating relationship with his wife and family. These scenes seemed necessary, but in my opinion were a little clunky in their execution. While there were some scenes that could have been shortened or cut out entirely (the film coming in to a lengthy 150 minutes), overall Donnie Brasco is a fine gangster flick.",

Donnie Brasco to see if it's interesting to know what happened in real life in the book of Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia. The actual film itself is loosely based on the true story of Joseph D. Pistone aka. Donnie Brasco played by the famous Johnny Depp himself. Donnie Brasco revealed to be Joseph D. Pistone who is an undercover FBI agent who infiltrated the Mafia Bonanno crime family in New York City during the 1970s. He befriends with Lefty Ruggiero played by Al Pacino who vouches for him. He gave him his trust and loved him like a son but he doesn't know his real identity. Al Pacino and Johnny Depp have good chemistry together and they both played good characters along with the other casts like Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby, James Russo, and Anne Heche. The line \"Forget about it\" is a line that has been said multiple times and I don't know how many times they're been saying that. If I don't know how many times they  said \"Forget about it\" just \"Forget about it\". So out of all the gangster films out there, this one is one of the deeper ones (if not the most deeper film). Some people say that this is best crime film, however it's not a perfect film by all means but it is a good film with a good story that stays true to the real life adaptation of the book. With strong performances by Al Pacino and Johnny Depp, this is a movie for you.",

The psychological dimensions of the story remain underrealized, but the loaded central premise and intimate focus the film sustains combine for a very involving and dramatic piece of crime lore that should generate solid late winter biz.\r In a substantial step down in the gangland pecking order from his roles in the \u201cGodfather\u201d films and \u201cScarface,\u201d Al Pacino here plays Lefty Ruggiero, a two-bit wiseguy who, as of the tale\u2019s start in 1978, has worked as a loyal foot soldier for 30 years, has done 26 hits by his count but is basically broke and destined not to ascend any higher in the ranks. Brash as he can be, Lefty is intimidated by his boss, Sonny Red (Robert Miano), and lives such an unrewarding home life with his obedient wife and junkie son that it\u2019s no wonder he prefers to spend most of his time with the boys.\r At his barroom hangout, Lefty meets a young man, Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp), who quickly impresses him with his knowledge of jewels and his tough-guy prowess. Smart and unafraid to stand his ground, Donnie inspires nothing but confidence as the older man shows him the ropes, giving him, as well as the audience, an irresistibly intriguing guided tour of mob life from the inside. Donnie meets Lefty\u2019s guardedly accepting cohorts, who most importantly include the hulking, explosively temperamental Sonny Black (Michael Madsen), the suspicious Paulie (James Russo) and the more voluble Nicky (Bruno Kirby), and is told that, under Lefty\u2019s sponsorship, he could be on the road to one day becoming a Made Guy in the family.\r What Lefty never knows, however, is that his streetwise willing student is actually FBI agent Joseph Pistone, who is taping hours of revealing talk and, as he is welcomed further into the mob hierarchy, accumulates mountains of evidence on their illegal activities. The question becomes, how long can Pistone\u2019s successful impersonation last before some slip puts him and the entire operation in jeopardy?\r The answer is, far too long for Pistone\u2019s wife Maggie, who is forced to endure long months without seeing her husband and is not even able to ask him what he\u2019s doing on the rare occasions he does return to see her and their three daughters. The strain on the marriage becomes almost unendurable, and one can only conclude that such a job is not one for a family man.\r But Donnie\u2019s ties to his new family are, by contrast, growing stronger, as his proposal for an expansion into Miami is met with approval by the quickly rising Sonny Black. But when the New York group\u2019s new club is raided by Miami police, the boys smell a rat. A subsequent struggle between Sonny Black and Sonny Red for dominance in Gotham inevitably leads to a bloodbath, whereupon it\u2019s only a matter of time until the FBI pulls Donnie out and puts the hammer down on the mob.\r All this would provide more than enough narrative incident for any movie, but screenwriter Paul Attanasio and director Mike Newell to resist wallowing in the alluring trappings of the gangster genre. Downplaying, although not ignoring, the standard violence, suspense and excitement, the filmmakers keep their attention trained on the growing bond between Lefty and Donnie and the looming betrayal that Donnie knows will doom the man who has taken him under his wing.\r So Donnie remains an opaque creation. The film does not give him an interior voice, a door into his feelings, so one cannot engage his point of view or even connect with this intriguing and brave man as much as one would like, despite the outward appeal of Depp\u2019s performance.\r By contrast, Pacino unlooses an unchecked stream of visible thought and emotion, beautifully delineating the need his small-time neighborhood thug has for a best friend and surrogate son. Although perhaps familiar in its outer trappings, Pacino\u2019s fine work is the key to the film succeeding to the extent that it does.\r Although the supporting actors get across the right attitudes, none of them have roles of sufficient depth to permit more than superficial readings. As Pistone\u2019s wife, Anne Heche gets to do little other than suffer and hurl accusations of neglect.\r Very proficient in the many scenes with the two main actors, Mike Newell\u2019s direction is a tad soft around the edges and lacks the intense atmospherics normally associated with such fare. Sharp production values accentuate the tacky disco-era look.",

The story is a mafia story that sells itself to the audience as a true story and after the credits rolled I jumped on Google to know more and found that some details were left out or changed slightly, I didn\u2019t think it made the film any less enjoyable though but I did think it was worth mentioning to you. Mafia stories in cinema are plenty and to be blunt most are rubbish but Donnie Brasco is one of the special ones that keep the viewer watching right to the end. Like all of my reviews I wont be giving away any spoilers about any film even older ones so you can read this one with confidence that you also can enjoy it. Mafia life, mafia death is a solid front for this film and I really liked that it showed more of everything in the \u201clife\u201d during the runtime than the downfall since that part of these gangster films really bring the tone down. The two major leads are Al Pacino and Johnny Depp and yes we all know Al Pacino is a fantastic actor and this film doesn\u2019t change that but the true wonder is Johnny Depp. Depp shows us before he was Capt Jack Sparrow from Pirates Of The Caribbean he really was a solid actor and I for one would love him to fill the realistic role of an actor again. Donnie Brasco shows us what its like to be pulled into organised crime and go from being a nothing jewel thief to roaming the big city of New York with some of the most feared men that walk its streets. The film clearly doesn\u2019t start exactly back far enough in my opinion but does give you enough back story to understand everything that is happening when the film kicks off. None of the areas of the film felt rushed or unfinished but I did wish the writers/director expanded of a few scenes and maybe cut down on others. This is the kind of film that if you had to guess what was going to happen next I think that 8 out of 10 times you\u2019d be right on the money, this isn\u2019t a bad thing because though you may know where its going you want to see how the screenwriter is going to show it.For a film based on organised crime I was expecting more violence but I put that down to the fact that almost every other gangster film over uses the violent factor. Since I mention violence don\u2019t go in watching thinking that its minimal because when it does show that side of the world it doesn\u2019t shy away. Some films and tv shows glorify violence to shock the viewer but I have always thought that type comes across as lazy writing whereas here its used just right. During the film the story progresses quite quickly and of course that makes sense because of the time constraint of film but I think at least putting some time scale on the film from time to time would have given a better understanding of how many days/months or even years have passed during each major situation.  It might sound like a minor gripe but it was really odd to follow a story only to be shuffled from one major situation to the other and have to guess how much time has passed.I like most movie lovers know the big hitters in this genre of film and I would put Donnie Brasco into that group. Holding off on some films or just forgetting them for whatever reason isn\u2019t always a bad thing as I don\u2019t think I would have appreciated DB the same way if I was younger. This film is one of the easiest films for me to write about and rate",

Donnie Brasco is an overlong stretched script that is predictable and flat out exhausting in its first act only to discover that the rest of it was just mundane. Mike Newell picks out his favourite details and sequences from the book and executes it with all the conviction but in the end there just isn't enough material to keep the audience investing in it. The only part that got it right was the star cast and boy oh boy what a star cast it is, Johnny Depp and Al Pacino face to face on screen encounters are the only highlights about it. But how much can a performance carry around a movie on its shoulder, Donnie Brasco lacks better editing, gripping screenplay and a soul.",
