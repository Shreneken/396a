  "summary": "A multifaceted look at the porn industry in Los Angeles in the 70's and 80's, focusing on the journey of a young man (Wahlberg) from restaurant dishwasher to porn star and beyond.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson has perfectly wedded form to function by filming Boogie Nights in a style suggesting the grainy texture of porn and the ambivalence of the era.",
    "While it's very funny, Boogie Nights taps into something much deeper with its on-target depiction of the shifting political and social tides of the '70s and '80s and thoughtful relationships between characters. It's a deeply satisfying movie.",
    "With Boogie Nights, we know we're not just watching episodes from disparate lives but a panorama of recent social history, rendered in bold, exuberant colors.",
    "Mark Wahlberg, in a star-making performance, has the kind of electric ingenuousness that John Travolta did in \"Saturday Night Fever.\"",
    "With its ceaseless music, large canvas, shrewd casting and flawless ensemble acting and the dexterity of its whiplashing mood switches, the movie recalls Robert Altman's \"Nashville\" more than any subsequent movie has.",
    "Has the quality of many great films, in that it always seems alive.",
    "Darkly comic, vastly entertaining and utterly original.",
    "From the second it begins, Boogie Nights seizes your senses and pulls you right in: no turning back, no time for debate, no regrets.",
    "I'm not sure all of this works out as convincingly as Anderson intends in the movie's somewhat unsatisfying ending, but getting there is a wickedly enjoyable journey.",
    "Isn't just an expose of the porn industry -- it's a provocative and involving character study, as well.",
    "Notwithstanding its occasional grotesque nods to postmodernist convention, this is highly entertaining Hollywood filmmaking, full of spark and vigor.",
    "A true storyteller, able to easily mix and match moods in a playful and audacious manner, he (Anderson) is a filmmaker definitely worth watching, both now and in the future.",
    "A stunning glimpse at acting -- and life -- in the raw.",
    "The movie's special gift happens to be Mark Wahlberg, who gives a terrifically appealing performance in this tricky role.",
    "Moore, who may be the most unpredictably talented actress in movies right now, plays Amber with an inseparable mixture of maternal feeling and lust that's flabbergasting.",
    "He (Anderson) manages to guide his cast of characters through an epic story of self-delusion with a skill and grace that many more experienced filmmakers would be hard put to match.",
    "It's a deeply divided film--hugely ambitious and uneven, with sequences that seem to point to a new, comically flagrant movie sexuality and others that drag one into the funky muddle of the dreariest dopehead downers from the '70s.",
    "These late scenes are over the top, as mean and reductive as editorials in a tabloid, and they nearly extinguish the moral subtlety of what's gone before.",
    "Heavily influenced by Quentin Tarantino's brand of quirky sensationalism, this high-energy saga by Paul Thomas Anderson goes a long way toward exposing the greed and stupidity of the pornography trade, then loses its moral compass and steers toward a sadly superficial ending."

Mark Wahlberg is an average actor at best. Some of the cast is alright mainly Julianne, Cheadle, Burt and a few cameos by Alfred Molina and Thomas Jane. Aside from all of those positive notes the movie is drab, overlong, full of many needless scenes, offensive profanity and some of the violence is also graphic. This movie could have been amazing but many changes to the actors, story and content needed to be applied before the movie was released in 1997. There isn't one reason anyone should see this movie.",

Everyone's born with one special thing, and Eddie Adams (Marc Wahlberg) uses his \"special gift\" and is poised to take the world of porn by storm. Eddie Adams, (also known as Dirk Diggler), is discovered by porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) and soars to the top of the pornography industry. After achieving great success in the industry during the 1970's, the 80's did not fair so well for Dirk. A change of culture coupled with a drug addiction, he quickly hits rock bottom not knowing anything else to turn to. At the heart of the story is a group of eccentric, outlandish group of characters, an unorthodox \"family\" if you will. An incredible collection of actors and performances keep this lengthy film completely engaging throughout the 155 minutes. Despite of what you may think of these people and their profession, you can't help but be drawn into their lives and personal stories. Paul Anderson's attention to the fine details; decor, style, culture, and social attitudes of the era are spot on. It is heart-rendering and darkly humorous with an message of redemption and forgiveness.",

It's a movie more than the usual life of the party story in which fun and drugs ensue. It tells its story with fascinating characters, including an absolute standout lead by Mark Whalberg. But what makes this movie stand out is Anderson's style and technique on how he tells this story and never loses your attention. The situations feel grounded in reality that we can identify with the characters and the struggles they go through. It does not just show the fun to be had behind the porn industry, but the dark side as well. The transformation in structure is done so beautifully that it stands out from other movies that take on this similar formula. Overall, \"Boogie Nights\" is a standout thanks to its excellent style, storytelling and performances (even if it hits familiar beats.) I give this an A!",

The scenes between Wahlberg and Reilly's characters are among the most memorable in any Anderson film. There is a lot more humor from scene to scene than in most Anderson films, ironically that may be why I didn't connect with these characters as well as would have liked. The scene where Diggler and the boys go to a drug dealers house to rip him off best illustrates this. This is a scene that is ultimately where the protagonist of the movie hits rock bottom, but instead of feeling that emotion, I was laughing and shaking my head in disbelief. Don't misunderstand, I enjoyed this scene, and I think Anderson wanted us to see the absurdity. However instead of connecting with these characters as I have in other Anderson films, these moments disconnect me. For me moments like this are what takes this film from being great to just another good movie.",

During the late '70s, a small cadre of directors believed that they could combine the raunch of real sex with an involving plot. It was a lofty goal, and one that ultimately proved impossible to realize, especially with the advent of video forcing movies to be made cheaper and faster. In his new film, Boogie Nights, writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson takes us back to the disco era, and, by following a small group of characters, recreates the rise and fall of \"artistic porn\" and those who participated in it.\r But Boogie Nights isn't just an expose of the porn industry -- it's a provocative and involving character study, as well. While it could be argued that Anderson has bitten off more than he can chew -- a few too many of the men and women populating his film are left half-developed -- an overambitious approach is always preferable to the alternative, and Boogie Nights does enough things right that it's easy to overlook its few shortcomings.\r One of the movie's greatest, and most immediately obvious, assets is its ability to capture the feel and mood of the late '70s and early '80s. At different times throughout the film, Anderson uses long, single takes where the camera pans from one character to another, putting the viewer in the midst of a swirl of activity. The director also has a talent for picking just the right songs for each scene, making the soundtrack an integral part of the movie rather than just a jumbled collection of old disco hits. Add to that the hairdos, clothing, decor, and attitudes of the era, and you have an effective re-creation of recent history. And, unlike The Ice Storm, which transpires in '70s suburbia, Boogie Nights is set in the sleazy heart of Los Angeles' drug-and-sex industry.\r Anderson also does a wonderful job of delineating the differences between the late '70s and the early '80s. The first half of the film, which takes place between 1977 and late 1979, is lively and energetic, with the focus on parties and good times. Then, following a pivotal sequence at a 1979/80 New Year's Eve gathering, Boogie Nights' tone shifts to something more grim and contentious. The porn industry goes into a downward spiral with mass-market video supplanting carefully-made movies, and the actors and directors are sucked down with it. Drugs and death run rampant. No one dies during the movie's first half (although there is a drug overdose), but the final hour features a body count.\r At Boogie Nights' center is Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), a waiter at a San Fernando Valley night club who is \"discovered\" by idealistic porn movie producer/director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds). Jack's dream is to make a movie that is \"true, and right, and dramatic,\" and his vision excites Eddie, who changes his name to Dirk Diggler and quickly becomes the hottest young stud in the industry. Together, the director and his star seek to elevate the Adult Film to the next level (which actually resembles a cheap exploitation action flick).\r Although Mark Wahlberg has the starring role, and gives the best performance of his career (although there are still times when he is stiff), he is easily overshadowed by two more impressive portrayals. Burt Reynolds, doing his best motion picture work in recent memory, develops Jack into a three-dimensional individual who really believes in his job until disillusionment hits. Matching Reynolds' performance step-by-step is Julianne Moore, who can add her role in Boogie Nights to an ever-increasing list of interesting and challenging characters. Meanwhile, Heather Graham, Don Cheadle, and William H. Macy are impressive in smaller parts (all of them deserve more screen time). And porn icon Nina Hartley gets some mainstream exposure, and even a few lines, as Little Bill's wife.\r Boogie Nights is filled with so many subplots and secondary themes that it would be impossible to recount them all here. Some of the most obvious involve the allure of stardom and the price certain individuals are willing to pay to attain it, the difficulty of \"rehabilitating\" one's name after being associated with something as \"damaging\" as the porn industry, and the inner need to belong. All of the men and women populating Boogie Nights encounter at least one of these elements as they traverse their character arc.\r With Boogie Nights, Anderson has realized the potential he showed in his previous feature, Hard 8 (which featured John C. Reilly and Philip Baker Hall, two members of this movie's ensemble cast). Boogie Nights is a dramatically rich and visually arresting motion picture that has earned (and is deserving of) comparisons to the films of Robert Altman. The result is a memorably penetrating motion picture.",

Riley) a Porn Actor with a unique taste in Magic, Buck Swope (Don Cheadle) a Porn Actor who is extremely knowledgable on stereo systems and is keen to run a buisness based on them, Scotty J. (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) a Gay boom operator who immediately falls for Eddie, \"Little\" Bill Thompson (William H. Macy) whose wife (real-life porn Actress Nina Hartley) constanly embarasses him by having sex with other men in movies and public, them and many other colourful characters.\r Eddie becomes acquainted to all of these quirky, likable characters and joins the industry under the name \"he sees in bright, blue neon lights\" Dirk Diggler, And becomes the industries hottest thing.\r Eventually Drugs kick in, the 80's is approaching and everyone goes there seperate ways, Dirk hits rock-bottom countless times, Bill shoots his wife them himself, Julianne Moore fails again to legally see her kids, Buck fails to get a loan. in a nutshell everything get's to their individual heads and ultimately it destroys them.\r Eventually though everything works out, in both unhappy and happy ways, Dirk reconciles with Jack, Rollergirl continues education, Buck uses stolen money to fund his buisness and aid his pregnant wife, Reed becomes a magician in a Nightclub. Essentially everything is back uder Jack Horner's control.\r Paul Thomas Anderson has made a film that is not solely based on Pornography, but based around the Actors and behind the scenes of it all, inspired by watching 70's porn flicks and enjoying the cheesy stories and setups which would eventually be missing from the 80's ones. he wrote \"The Dirk Diggler story\" a 30 min tribute flick about a fictional porn star.\rObviously sometime later he managed to build this wonderpiece around that original idea.\r Boogie Nights is an Essential PTA movie, everything he does has always had character development in mind, and in all honesty with this film he's not asking you to engage the characters or Pornography, but rather watch and identify the individualism of the real people behing the fictional Camera.\r Aside from that everyone is wonderful, Burt Reynolds steals the show as the always laid back director, Mark Wahlberg's insecurities give him alot to work with and he does well,\rEveryone in their own right in this movie, actors and characters are all perfect.\r Final Verdict: Sit down and Enjoy, Great casting, An Excellent screenplay, Sharp directing and of course one of the 90's best hits.",

I love the cast of this film so much. Burt Reynolds was the perfect character to play Jack in this movie. He is cool as hell. I didn't care for Julianne Moore until I saw this movie, I thought she did a great job and she was the character that I liked the best just because she was such a nice person. There is also Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly both of who I really like and are great in this film. I think what is so special about Boogie Nights is that it captures its time so well and brings us behind the scenes of the pornographic industry a place where we have never been before.",

During the late '70s, a small cadre of directors believed that they could combine the raunch of real sex with an involving plot. It was a lofty goal, and one that ultimately proved impossible to realize, especially with the advent of video forcing movies to be made cheaper and faster. In his new film, Boogie Nights, writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson takes us back to the disco era, and, by following a small group of characters, recreates the rise and fall of \"artistic porn\" and those who participated in it.\r But Boogie Nights isn't just an expose of the porn industry -- it's a provocative and involving character study, as well. While it could be argued that Anderson has bitten off more than he can chew -- a few too many of the men and women populating his film are left half-developed -- an overambitious approach is always preferable to the alternative, and Boogie Nights does enough things right that it's easy to overlook its few shortcomings.\r One of the movie's greatest, and most immediately obvious, assets is its ability to capture the feel and mood of the late '70s and early '80s. At different times throughout the film, Anderson uses long, single takes where the camera pans from one character to another, putting the viewer in the midst of a swirl of activity. The director also has a talent for picking just the right songs for each scene, making the soundtrack an integral part of the movie rather than just a jumbled collection of old disco hits. Add to that the hairdos, clothing, decor, and attitudes of the era, and you have an effective re-creation of recent history. And, unlike The Ice Storm, which transpires in '70s suburbia, Boogie Nights is set in the sleazy heart of Los Angeles' drug-and-sex industry.\r Anderson also does a wonderful job of delineating the differences between the late '70s and the early '80s. The first half of the film, which takes place between 1977 and late 1979, is lively and energetic, with the focus on parties and good times. Then, following a pivotal sequence at a 1979/80 New Year's Eve gathering, Boogie Nights' tone shifts to something more grim and contentious. The porn industry goes into a downward spiral with mass-market video supplanting carefully-made movies, and the actors and directors are sucked down with it. Drugs and death run rampant. No one dies during the movie's first half (although there is a drug overdose), but the final hour features a body count.\r At Boogie Nights' center is Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), a waiter at a San Fernando Valley night club who is \"discovered\" by idealistic porn movie producer/director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds). Jack's dream is to make a movie that is \"true, and right, and dramatic,\" and his vision excites Eddie, who changes his name to Dirk Diggler and quickly becomes the hottest young stud in the industry. Together, the director and his star seek to elevate the Adult Film to the next level (which actually resembles a cheap exploitation action flick).\r Although Mark Wahlberg has the starring role, and gives the best performance of his career (although there are still times when he is stiff), he is easily overshadowed by two more impressive portrayals. Burt Reynolds, doing his best motion picture work in recent memory, develops Jack into a three-dimensional individual who really believes in his job until disillusionment hits. Matching Reynolds' performance step-by-step is Julianne Moore, who can add her role in Boogie Nights to an ever-increasing list of interesting and challenging characters. Meanwhile, Heather Graham, Don Cheadle, and William H. Macy are impressive in smaller parts (all of them deserve more screen time). And porn icon Nina Hartley gets some mainstream exposure, and even a few lines, as Little Bill's wife.\r Boogie Nights is filled with so many subplots and secondary themes that it would be impossible to recount them all here. Some of the most obvious involve the allure of stardom and the price certain individuals are willing to pay to attain it, the difficulty of \"rehabilitating\" one's name after being associated with something as \"damaging\" as the porn industry, and the inner need to belong. All of the men and women populating Boogie Nights encounter at least one of these elements as they traverse their character arc.\r With Boogie Nights, Anderson has realized the potential he showed in his previous feature, Hard 8 (which featured John C. Reilly and Philip Baker Hall, two members of this movie's ensemble cast). Boogie Nights is a dramatically rich and visually arresting motion picture that has earned (and is deserving of) comparisons to the films of Robert Altman. The result is a memorably penetrating motion picture.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nBoogie Nights is an incredibly well directed movie about the seedy, psuedo-glamorous industry of pornography. The best parts of the film are in the direction and atmosphere of the movie. The costumes, colors, and environment bleed late 1970'2 Los Angeles. The film is in essence about sex as a commodity. Throughout the film there is no passion or love it is just a way of making money. In one scene when Dirk Diggler's package is finally revealed it is not as a tease or anything like that; it is for us to see what the moneymaking product is. The film's performances are all solid and interesting. Burt Reynolds is phenomenal as the director Jack Horner and the rest o the performances are all interesting and show the actors and actresses as people, not objects. One other thing about \"Boogie Nights\" is how it effortlessly brings together humor, drama, and action. Julianne Moore's custody battle for her child is a particularly heart-wrenching scene; while the pool scenes bring in more comedic elements. However, Boogie Nights does have a few shortcomings. The entire second half of the movie teeters on being melodramatic and gets rid of the likability of some of the characters. I understand that it is meant to show what fame does to people but to me it wasn't the right direction for the movie to take. Also, a few scenes such as the scene at the drug dealer's house were out of character and were more upsetting then integral to the plot. Despite these shortcomings \"Boogie Nights\" is an excellent movie by an excellent director.",

Paul Thomas Anderson has its name written all over the frame that is perfectly balanced on this character and plot driven feature where if not for his execution, it would have been difficult to pull off such a powerful script. Mark Wahlberg is brilliant in his portrayal and is supported well enough by a great cast like Julianne Moore, William H. Macy and Heather Graham.

A clever analogy for the beauty, innocence and art of cinema and celluloid, being replaced by cheap and nasty mass-produced video, made solely for profit and entertainment.What's interesting is how PTA is able the make such a sleazy and immoral environment seem so fun and innocent, within the first act. When the 80's arrive and everything takes a turn for the worst, the writing lost its way and Boogie Nights becomes a bit of a mess (I thought the same of Magnolia). We lose touch with the central characters and Wahlberg (who is great in the 1st half) doesn't have the chops to play the latter stages of his character's demise. The character/scene's which made the greatest impression were with Eric and his mother,  based on PTA's own mother.Bogie Nights is still a great achievement, especially considering PTA was only 27 when he made it.",
