    "summary": "Based on James Ellroy's novel about the movie industry, corrupt cops, tabloid journalism, gangsters and sexual obsessions of every stripe, L.A. Confidential is set in 1950's Los Angeles.",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "A movie bull's-eye: noir with an attitude, a thriller packing punches. It gives up its evil secrets with a smile.",
        "A juicy noir stew of amorality that's the best thing since \"Chinatown.\"",
        "A tough, gorgeous, vastly entertaining throwback to the Hollywood that did things right. As such, it enthusiastically breaks most rules of studio filmmaking today.",
        "An irresistible treat with enough narrative twists and memorable characters for a half-dozen films.",
        "L.A. Confidential, with an exceptional ensemble cast directed by Curtis Hanson from James Ellroy's densely plotted novel, looks to be the definitive noir for this particular time and place.",
        "He's (Hanson) never before generated the kind of heat inside a picture--and out of it--that he has with L.A. Confidential.",
        "One of the best crime dramas to come along in years.",
        "Seductive and beautiful, cynical and twisted, and one of the best films of the year.",
        "There are so many things to enjoy here.",
        "As the story unfolds, carefully and elaborately, what develops is not just a remarkably intricate crime tale but a brilliant and compassionate story of people who struggle to rise above their flawed nature. This may be the best movie of the year; it's definitely one of the greatest crime films of all time.",
        "Voluptuously engrossing.",
        "You have to pay close attention to follow the double-crossing intricacies of the plot, but the reward for your work is dark and dirty fun.",
        "See L.A. Confidential. Be astonished at discovering anew how very, very satisfying movies can still be. And how fine that can feel.",
        "This movie restores genre elements to a level of potency that's disturbing, satisfying, and rare as hell.",
        "This sleek adaptation of James Ellroy's dauntingly complex novel has the black-and-white tabloid soul of an old \"Confidential\" magazine.",
        "Lately, it seems that film noir has become the province of independent productions. As a result, it's refreshing to see a big-budget, studio effort of this sort that does nearly everything right.",
        "Hanson delivers something ever rarer in film culture, not a new film noir but an old-fashioned total movie, somehow of a single piece.",
        "That rare mainstream cop thriller that refuses to telegraph its outcome in the first 15 minutes or, for much of its running time, to tell you how to feel about its protagonists.",
        "A movie of shadows and half lights, the best approximation of the old black-and-white noir look anyone has yet managed on color stock.",
        "Full of period locations, costumes, and one very clever Lana Turner gag, it's easy to see why Ellroy is so pleased with the film.",
        "A glamorous, alluring entertainment that revels in the artifice of Hollywood while exposing its corrupt heart, L.A. Confidential pays stylish homage to some of the great film noirs of the distant and recent past.",
        "\"The Big Sleep\" and \"The Maltese Falcon\" echo loudly throughout.",
        "The story is so complicated that the movie can't quite make it clear, but the picture has impressive energy and high-intensity performances from Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, and Guy Pearce.",
        "A movie that refuses to kick into gear until it's far too late.",
        "Director Curtis Hanson keeps the hugely complicated story zooming along the boulevard of broken dreams without losing sight of the details that make the trip worthwhile."

Guy\rPearce ,just nailed the character of Ed Exley.His transformation from a\rfame-lover and political smart officer to a real justice seeking man is\rvery good.

Confidential perfectly captures the dark and dirty world of a 1950s pulp-noir. The film, as is often the case with noir, is all about contrast - whether it's the contrast between sun-kissed villas and dingy slum interiors, or the contrast between a cop following the law to the letter and another bending the rules to get the job done, or even the contrast between steamy romance and brutal violence. The various plot-lines that run parallel to each other feel episodic, but all are engaging and build to an immensely satisfying conclusion.The performances across the board are strong,but of particular note are Guy Pearce's by-the-book lead protagonist, Kevin Spacey's celebrity super-cop and James Cromwell's formidable police chief - they cast make the already excellent script shine. You have all the usual noir hallmarks - the femme-fatale (Basinger), the quick-talking, smart-ass reporter (DeVito), dirty criminals and even dirtier cops, yet L.A. Confidential still manages to be creative. For instance, few films that I can think of put such a focus on the public face of a police force - the maintenance of a media machine that is required to keep the authorities looking like the good guys. The film is nigh-on flawless, and a joy to watch.",

Confidential may be one of the few book adaptations that holds up (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo does too) and despite its very loose adaptation it is flawlessly executed with standout performances from the likes of Kevin Spacey and James Cromwell. However the film really belongs to Guy Pearce's Ed Exley who is the by the book character everyone loves to hate. This may be an oversimplification on my part but his performance is flawless, invoking all the emotions, especially as he reminisces about the death of his father in a gripping scene between him and Spacey's Jack Vincennes (whose answer to why he became a cop is brilliant). At its best LA Confidential is a film of two halves but each episode is cleverly put together with each character shining. The film embraces the period, including the obsession with noir and pulp to great effect with Kim Basinger bringing to life the role of the Femme Fatale as she effortlessly manipulates those she sees while also showing her vulnerable side during her scenes with Russell Crowe's Bud White (A career highlight). The story follows the brutal murders of the staff and customers of a late night coffee shop called the Nite Owl. However a plot that starts out simple frays off into multiple sub plots that are equally intriguing and cleverly put together providing one of the most intelligent look at the inner workings of a police station and the people we trust to solve our crime (The game L.A. Noire tries to do the same but falls flat). The film is a exhilarating tale of corruption, murder, sex and general wrong-doing that shows that there is no black and white, only shades of grey. Its everything a perfect noir should be and more. A timeless classic.",

These are just some of the elements that make Curtis Hanson's L.A.Crooked cops. The mystery and allure of Hollywood in the '50s. Death, double-crossing, and secret alliances. Paparazzi waiting to get that one breakthrough picture. These are just some of the elements that make Curtis Hanson's L.A. Confidential one of the most exhilarating noir thrillers to reach the screen in recent memory. With a script that pays homage to the films of the '40s and '50s and may remind some viewers of the likes of Chinatown, L.A. Confidential proves that every period piece thriller doesn't have to go the way of Mulholland Falls.\r It's 1953, and the City of Angels is in the grip of an unprecedented wave of violence. Cops on the take turn their backs on crimes. The jailing of a major mob boss leaves a vacuum of power that leads to a turf war. Then comes the Night Owl Massacre, where six victims (including an ex-cop) are brutally gunned down at the Night Owl Caf\u00e9. The police begin routine investigations, but it quickly becomes apparent that this is no ordinary multiple homicide.\r The difference between L.A. Confidential and numerous other, more routine films of the genre begins with the script. Smart, insightful, and consistently engaging, Hanson and Brian Helgeland's faithful adaptation of James Ellroy's novel is a real treat for anyone who views film as a medium for both art and entertainment. The movie is filled with small twists and turns, but not so many that the plot becomes difficult to swallow or to follow. The subplots - and there are several - are as well-developed as the main story, and the supporting characters are presented as more than mere colorful misfits decorating the background.\r Atmosphere is another of L.A. Confidential's strengths. This is Technicolor noir - a film made in color that has black-and-white sensibilities. Like Devil in a Blue Dress, this movie proves that multi- hued film stock does not automatically hamstring such a production. And, while the Los Angeles of L.A. Confidential may not accurately reflect the real city during the '50s, it nevertheless represents what we expect Hollywood to have been like, from the glitzy buildings to the cool-but-beautiful femme fatales and the sure-handed, silent men.\r The three leads give strong performances. Spacey's Jack is cocky and confident, Crowe's Bud is brimming with tightly-controlled anger, and Pearce's Ed is caught between his towering ambition and his desire to do the right thing. It's interesting to note that two of the three main actors in this distinctly American tale are Australian. Despite having appeared opposite Denzel Washington in Virtuosity, Crowe is best known for roles in the likes of Proof and Romper Stomper. Pearce's big break came when he cross-dressed in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. It's worth noting that both actors have perfected their American accents to the point where it's virtually impossible to detect a down under twang. Meanwhile, the supporting performers include James Cromwell as the chief of police, Kim Basinger as the woman torn between Ed and Bud, and David Strathairn as a high-class pimp.\r It takes L.A. Confidential nearly two and one-half hours to spin its tale, but the time passes remarkably quickly. There's hardly a wasted moment in the entire movie, and director Hanson (whose previous credits include The Hand that Rocks the Cradle and The River Wild) maintains tight control of every scene. Lately, it seems that film noir has become the province of independent productions. As a result, it's refreshing to see a big-budget, studio effort of this sort that does nearly everything right. L.A. Confidential is likely to be one of the best offerings of the early Autumn.",

Confidential, I immediately realise that it's directed by Curtis Hanson, the same guy who directed The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. It had some big stars in this like Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger and Danny DeVito. It had a good story about three police officers and detectives investigating the \"Nite Owl case\" and other stuff. Kevin Spacey is Det. Sgt. Jack Vincennes who moonlights as a technical advisor on Badge of Honor, a popular TV police drama series. He is also providing Sid Hudgens, publisher of the Hush-Hush tabloid magazine. Russell Crowe is Officer Wendell \"Bud\" White who is in love with Lynn Bracken and he investigates the Nite Owl case where his partner is killed. Guy Pearce is Det. Lt. Edmund \"Ed\" Exley who is investigating the Nite Owl case. His father is murdered by a man who Exley nicknames \"Rollo Tomasi\". I kinda like the part where the police and criminals are fighting at \"Bloody Christmas\". The story is great and well written and it is faithful to the novel which is based on by James Ellroy. Kim Basinger is really good as Lynn Bracken, the directing style is immense when something goes wrong and the police are on the crime investigation and the cinematography is great. I know I say that quite a lot but what can I say? They immense. As much I loved it for it's story, directing, editing, art design and cinematography and everything about this. L.A. Confidential is a impeccable neo-noir crime film filled with characters, mystery and beautifully crafted set pieces. If you guys haven't seen it then I will definitely recommend you watch it. It is very good, really fantastic and very Hush-Hush.",

The film is now a little forgotten, or at least I haven't seen it so much on TV specialized movie channels... but the fact is that it is a remarkable work of cinema, won two Oscars (Best Actress, for Kim Basinger, and Best Adapted Screenplay) and received nominations for seven more statuettes (Best Film, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Soundtrack). It was, in fact, the great film of 1997, even better than \"Titanic\".The film takes place in the golden years of Hollywood: shortly after the arrest of the biggest mobster in the city, the police seem determined to prevent the formation of new crime syndicates, but gradually the rot and corruption of the police force itself becomes evident. Among them, three policemen stand out, for different reasons: the brutal Bud White, the self-centered Jack Vincennes and the determined and incorruptible Ed Exley. Each of them, alone and in his own way, finds himself investigating the same crime: the death of a policeman in a massacre that took place inside a restaurant, and his eventual relationship with a mobster who runs a deal of luxury call-girls, surgically operated to resemble cinema stars.I loved this movie, in all its engaging ways. The script is extraordinary and develops in a wonderful way, giving each of the characters the time to develop, even some that would otherwise be relegated to an amorphous background. As in a good film noir, women are not as innocent as they appear, and the police are far from being the heroes. There are no one-sided characters, they all have a rich dark core, which the script takes as much advantage as it can.The cast is truly colossal and is full of big names. Kevin Spacey achieves, with this film, one of his best works as an actor, at least for me, and the same can be said of Kim Basinger, in a somber character that reminds us of one of the most wronged and forgotten actresses of the golden age of Hollywood : Veronica Lake. Did the Oscar given to Basinger this year also end up being, indirectly, a posthumous prize for this great actress, whom Hollywood devoured, but never esteemed or honored? In addition to these two actors, the film also features an excellent work by two Australian actors, Russel Crowe and Guy Pearce, both at the best level, and a great Danny De Vito, in an amoral and delightfully hypocritical character. James Cromwell was equally excellent in his role.Technically, the film is full of value and quality, starting with grandiose cinematography, which avoids falling into the commonplace of noir films and fills the screen with color and light, capturing the Californian sun and the beauty of the city in its rich colors. The filming locations chosen for the recordings are excellent and their judicious use helped the film to fit the period and the context in an impeccable way. The sets and costumes, as well as the automobiles that were used, help a lot in creating an environment and a clear temporal notion, and are magnificent on the screen. The soundtrack, in charge of Jerry Goldsmith, is impeccable and appears at the right time.",
