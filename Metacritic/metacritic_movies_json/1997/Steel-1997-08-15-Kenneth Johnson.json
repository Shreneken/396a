  "summary": "A scientist for the military turns himself into a cartoon-like superhero when a version of one of his own weapons is being used against enemies.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The concept may not be bad, but there are times when the execution borders on embarrassing.",
    "Well-intentioned but hulky and lumbering, \"Steel\" falls somewhere between the cacophony of \"Batman & Robin\" and the tepid Robert Townsend vehicle \"Meteor Man.\" With a size-22 shoe, it just keeps stepping on its own feet.",
    "Writer-director Kenneth Johnson provides a tinny story and a leaden pace for his tarnished titan. There’s a coziness and simplicity to the production that would be better served on TV. Cinema-size, it comes off as corny, antiquated and slightly cheesy.",
    "A tepid vat of cinematic sludge...O'Neal will doubtless survive this latest misadventure, as he did last year's outing as a genie in \"Kazaam,\" but only the most devoted of his admirers will want to watch him lumber through \"Steel.\"",
    "\"Steel\" plays like a Saturday morning cartoon -- overdone stunts and hokey chase sequences with the hero on a motorcycle, dodging heavily armed gangsters as well as cops who think he's a bad guy.",
    "Steel's target audience of 12-year-old boys would be better off staying home and busying themselves at traditional, character-enriching activities: sniping at family pets with BB guns, playing Nintendo, and masturbating.",
    "You know you are in trouble when the back cover of the DVD boasts that \"There'll be a lot of thrillin' before Steel himself can start chillin'.\""
