  "summary": "An engrossing sci-fi thriller about an all-too-human man who dares to defy a system obsessed with genetic perfection.  [Sony]",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "A handsome and fully imagined work of cautionary futuristic fiction.",
    "Niccol's futuristic fable is a gorgeous construct, from its cast on down to the brilliant, clinical nature of the set design that reflects a future in which even a particle of saliva can be one's undoing.",
    "This is one of the smartest and most provocative of science fiction films, a thriller with ideas.",
    "The average thriller, even if it's set in a faraway or futuristic world, tends to offer visceral, ephemeral excitement, and not much else. However, while Gattaca has the energy and tautness to compare with the best of those, its thought-provoking script and thematic richness elevate it to the next level.",
    "The film's bleak future society is admittedly nothing new, and there's no lack of contrived or wooden moments, but Gattaca's parable of nature versus nurture is compelling enough to make it worth seeing for reasons besides art direction.",
    "Gattaca, New Zealander helmer Andrew Niccol's impressive feature debut, is an intelligent and timely sci-fi thriller that, with the exception of some illogical plot contrivances, is emotionally engaging almost up to the end.",
    "Andrew Niccol wrote and directed this intelligent and suspenseful science-fiction drama featuring strong performances by Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Alan Arkin, and Gore Vidal.",
    "Gattaca is a welcome throwback to the days of good, low-tech sci-fi, stressing character and atmosphere over computer-generated effects and juvenile thrills.",
    "Implausible in countless ways and wooden for long stretches, Gattaca at least never collapses into a special-effects barrage or erupts in long, choreographed explosions; it sticks carefully to its pristine vision.",
    "Sets, music, and imagery are rigorously controlled and undeniably stunning, but after a while flaws creep into the plot's double helix.",
    "Designer babies rule dystopia in stylish SF thriller filled with recycled plot devices.",
    "Although that's enough plot for two movies, Niccol proceeds to clog up his meticulously mounted story with a murder and a romance (hence Uma Thurman), allowing needless intrigue to distract from his ideas.",
    "Niccol's work is artful but self-important and thin.",
    "No aliens. No firefights in space. No robots. Just an eerily attractive, sleekly costumed cast in a stylish, cooly intelligent throwback to the Twilight Zone era of deeply serious science fiction.",
    "Although the movie has its moments -- particularly when our hero finds himself surrounded by a gimlet-eyed circle of futuristic detectives -- it's never really successful.",
    "Gattaca may be all done up in new-fangled notions, but underneath all the guff about designer babies, it rests on a notion that was a staple of the original \"Star Trek\" series.",
    "Clearly, an effort was made to create a serious, thoughtful movie.",
    "It's a great set-up but sadly the plot unfolds slowly and with little action, playing like a short story.",
    "Niccol's script, which has the earnest simplicity of a freshman philosophy paper, is merely naked exploitation, a sci-fi snow job that projects a contemporary ethical question--would a perfect human be human?--into a solemn future where the worst-case scenario unfolds as conventional Hollywood melodrama.",
    "The moody images and Michael Nyman's score aren't enough to salvage this banal 1997 science fiction story."

I think \"Noop\" needs to watch this again. \"No essence.\" What are you on about?. Of course the essence was there and it was in the quite insipid form of discrimination based on a humans DNA which has already started to some degree and in the film relegates those without perfect DNA to the scrap heap and dead end jobs. It is not to hard to imagine the losses to human civilization if such discrimination had existed a hundred or so years ago. For example, Albert Einstein would have been on the scrap heap. Makes you think doesn't it. An excellent script with superb performances by the cast, particularly Jude Law. Again I find myself wishing I could push the scorer further to the right. 10 out of 10 does not give justice to this superb film.",

Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude Law, and Alan Arkin, turn in great performances here and you can really feel the emotion in their performances. The score is also brilliant and the thrills/intrigue are provided quite capably by this one. In addition, the sets are effects are really well done. However, where this one truly excels is in its message. A warning about eugenics, Gattaca is not really a science fiction film or a thriller. Rather, it is an inspirational film as it shows that no matter what people think, you can achieve your dreams if you work hard enough to do so, even if there are things that could/will hold you back. In terms of the science fiction, the futuristic elements and technologies are all really well done and developed, plus all are very interesting ideas that may seem implausible now, but could be fact in just a matter of time. The thriller element was also interesting, but since I do not want to spoil too much, I will not mention what I like about it, but it keeps you on edge as you try to see if the cops will figure everything out or not. Overall, Gattaca is a smart, thrilling film that grabs a hold of you early on and does not let go until the film is over.",
