  "title": "Good Will Hunting",
  "rating": 8.6,
  "release_date": "1997-12-05",
  "genre": [
    "Drama"
  ],
  "summary": "Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a brilliant mathematician, but also an angry young man. To avoid jail time, he agrees to work with Sean (Robin Williams) a therapist who comes from the same tough Boston neighborhood.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "Intimate, heartfelt and wickedly funny, it's a movie whose impact lingers.",
    "First and foremost, Good Will Hunting is a film riding young, exuberant energies.",
    "The script's bare bones are familiar, yet the film also has fine acting, steady momentum, a sharp eye and a very warm heart.",
    "Director Van Sant, who made the lyrical \"Mala Noche,\" \"Drugstore Cowboy\" and \"My Own Private Idaho,\" returns to his favorite hunting ground -- the subworlds of grimy, poetic lost boys -- and pulls us right in",
    "Damon convincingly matches Williams recrimination for recrimination in this portrayal of mutual tough love, even with the latter giving what may be the best performance of his career.",
    "Gus Van Sant, working from the tangy, well-written script, gets so much humor, grit and emotional truth out of this tale that the familiar formulas behind it simply fall away.",
    "This beautifully realized tale is always engaging and often quite touching.",
    "An ordinary story told well. Taken as a whole, there's little that's special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path, leaves the audience with a warm, fuzzy feeling, and never really challenges or surprises us.",
    "It's the individual moments, not the payoff, that make it so effective.",
    "You'd never guess this just-off-center movie was directed by indie hero Gus Van Sant. Maybe, like Will, he's casual about his gifts and feels no need to trot them out.",
    "Stuffed--indeed, overstuffed--with heart, soul, audacity, and blarney. You may not believe a minute of it, but you don't necessarily want to stop watching.",
    "Both smart and shrewd -- it wraps that same comforting message in a thoroughly entertaining package.",
    "This is good, solid work that never achieves either the art or poignance of Van Sant's earlier and more personal projects.",
    "While the charismatic performances of Damon and Affleck make Good Will Hunting a difficult entertainment to resist, doing just that is not as hard as the film would like to think.",
    "It isn't surprising that the film was originally based on actors' improvisations, since it creates a universe of tremendously enjoyable characters and allows them plenty of room to roam, but has only the most predictable notion of plot and nothing whatever to say beyond be-yourself pieties.",
    "Part character study, part redemptive drama, and all cheesy heart, it's Boston-baked melodrama, a little too gooey at times, but still pretty delicious.",
    "Matt Damon and Robin Williams give touching performances, but Gus Van Sant's filmmaking is surprisingly ordinary.",
    "Van Sant's direction is surprisingly static and conventional, which doesn't help this earnest, underwhelming misfire.",
    "Damon--as actor, not as co-screenwriter--is the best thing about Good Will Hunting.",
    "The acting is top-notch and some scenes are authentically well-observed."

So yeah this movie is another one that everyone should see because the way Matt Damon and Ben Affleck this art is that they fake you out in the beginning making you think it’a a comedy but then you get introduced to Robin’s character and then the movie flips into a drama. So the main person I really want to bring light on is Robin because he is so amazing in this roll he goes from being a humble person to grabbing Matt’s character by the neck and that’s what makes him feel more real, he has emotions and with his perfect performance he brings weight to a certain type of character and I don’t think I can ever unsee the way he plays him and I don’t want to either.

That's a tough one, but I'll take a shot. Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody puts a code on my desk, something nobody else can break. Maybe I take a shot at it and maybe I break it. And I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I did my job well. But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East. Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen hundred people I never met, never had no problem with, get killed. Now the politicians are sayin', \"Oh, send in the Marines to secure the area\" 'cause they don't give a **** It won't be their kid over there, gettin' shot. Just like it wasn't them when their number got called, 'cause they were pullin' a tour in the National Guard. It'll be some kid from Southie takin' shrapnel in the ass. And he comes back to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from. And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks. Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason he was over there in the first place was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price. And, of course, the oil companies used the skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices. A cute little ancillary benefit for them, but it ain't helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And they're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil back, of course, and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink martinis and **** play slalom with the icebergs, and it ain't too long 'til he hits one, spills the oil and kills all the sea life in the North Atlantic. So now my buddy's out of work and he can't afford to drive, so he's got to walk to the **** job interviews, which sucks 'cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids. And meanwhile he's starvin', 'cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat, the only blue plate special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State. So what did I think? I'm holdin' out for somethin' better. I figure **** it, while I'm at it why not just shoot my buddy, take his job, give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard?

The story is predictable but what makes it enjoyable are the characters, the acting, and the relationships (particularly Will’s relationship with Williams’ character as well as his relationship with Ben Affleck’s character). It’s a nice feel good movie. My only issues come from the last third/fourth of the movie where we have to sit through a lot of arguing as well as moping and doping even though its obvious that the film will end on a happy note and what that note will be specifically. Since this is a Robin Williams movie where he plays a teacher that inspires a pupil, I feel its fair to compare it to Dead Poet’s Society, which is a better film. I found the arc of the students’ in that film to be far more interesting and I like how the happy ending comes at the cost of some tragedy. Additionally, that film was not as predictable. With all that said though I still enjoy Good Will Hunting it’s a heart-warming film with a good message that pulls at your heart strings. It makes you laugh and cry as well as remember a time when cell phones did not exist and the Dunkin Donuts logo looked different. It is cliché and predictable but I’m willing to overlook it because the characters are likeable and the relationships are fantastic especially in the first half (second half/third is where the clichés fall in). This is definitely a movie that everyone should see at least once in their life.",

The film has a tendency to give you speeches instead of conversations but they are so well written you cannot help but listen in awe as these characters wax lyrical.

The problem with this is that Will seems very reluctant to be noticed for his remarkable talents, but famed lecturer Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgård) takes it upon himself to mentor the young but flawed genius, who has a knack for getting into countless fights and all other forms of bad behaviour with his best pals Chuckie (Ben Affleck), Morgan (Casey Affleck) and Billy (Cole Hauser).\rAs Lambeau attempts to put Will through therapy, Will makes a mockery of the process, so Lambeau decides to send him to a longtime friend, Dr. Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), a roommate Lambeau's younger years. Sean immediately notices the similarities that he and Will share in regards to family life and past problems.\rWritten by Damon and Affleck, Good Will Hunting tells a trial and error story of how our pasts most definitely matter and make a difference to how our futures may take shape. Will is frightened to let anybody into his life, even giving up his remarkable abilities just so he can remain with people he trusts, and not get hurt again the way is troubled and horrific past show.\rBut the film is also cleverly funny, with the chemistry between Damon and Williams electrifying, bouncing off each other in fast-paced successions of dialogue and humour.\rRobin Williams gives a magical and emotional performance as Will's eventual therapist, he holds troubles quite dear to himself that he could never speak about until this kid came along, something that certainly taught both characters a lesson.\rThe film does play out in a very predictable and often feel-good manner, but this isn't a bad thing, Will's character needed to develop and evolve to the new people in his life, including a girl (Minnie Driver) a student who falls for Will. With an Oscar for Damon and Affleck for their screenplay and a well-deserved Oscar for best supporting actor in Robin Williams, Good Will Hunting has all the ingredients of a well crafted, gifted and defining piece of cinema that still goes down as one of the best films of all time.",

A superb cast, surprisingly it's one of Matt Damon's best acting works. And of course, a wonderful game by Robin Williams. A Good Will Hunting drama that exists and will exist beyond time, it will always be relevant. Good Will Hunting is a prime example of demonstrating people's self-reflection. Throughout the film, 2 societies are opposed: the intelligentsia societies led by Gerald Lambeau and the societies of ordinary friends with Chuck. The finale of Good Will Hunting is excellent, Will chose love after all, which only happens 1 time",

It is about a extremely intelligent person who is only a Janitor, and after he is jailed for assaulting someone he has to go and see a therapist. I'll let you watch the movie, but the rest of it is about him uncovering his potential making friends and learning valuable lessons. Highly Recommended.",

This vivacious film runs on nothing but the merit of the script. Matt DamonAccept Your Blessings.Good Will HuntingVan Sant's coaching is pretty much what you already know. His guidance isn't extraordinary but is undeniably productive. This vivacious film runs on nothing but the merit of the script. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, the writers, aren't bringing anything new on the table, but it is the Disney of the dramatic movies. Incredibly confident in its ingredients, the film never stutters, not even for a frame. What's been so crowd pleasing about the script, is its ability to create a topsy-turvy world in a pragmatic one. Usually, the concept of \"power\" in the hand is often presented as misused by the characters and also always is craved by them.In here, Matt Damon who powerfully portrays a guy that accounts in, his photographic memory as a hindrance. His surrounding doesn't ask him to repel it, but his affection towards that very surrounding and the fear to go physically distant with it, makes him turn all this into a hobby. Damon's excruciating performance of an arrogant and blessed kid has a match that makes him rubble in a snap.And the answer is Robin Williams, that cloaks in a completely opposite persona to Damon in order to get in, in his game. If Damon likes to hurt, he keeps his wound open, if Damon oozes power and rage, he whispers warmth so gently that it makes your eyes teary within a blink. And despite of all the other tracks sprinkled amazingly in the film, Williams and Damon sharing a few laughs sitting in the room is the best asset of it, that Gus Van Sant is well aware of and encourages it like some big antic to stand tall and proud upon. Good Will Hunting is never a hunt, if anything it is the surrender in a long lasting lost game, that actually our host never cares for.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThis an exceptional movie revolving around the theme growth. We start out meeting Will Hunting as a cocky, rude and frankly dangerous 20 year old who has no idea what he is doing, and when he is convicted for a fight, we soon learn at court that he is an orphan who has had many abusive foster families, causing his behaviour. By the end of the movie, Will has ironically matured in age and in character as he gets a job he is finally worthy of, and whilst he originally takes it, he decides to leave it whilst he goes to \"see about a girl\". This therefore shows he has taken the even braver option, facing his demons of forever being alone. The growth theme takes the same journey with Will's therapist Sean, who we see move on from the passing of his wife. When Will first confronts Sean about his wife, Sean gets so angry that he strangles him, but when Will confronts him about it more angrily in a later session, Sean replies calmly. Sean is also shown to have confronted his inner termoil towards the professor. Sean's plotline concludes as he decides to go travelling (showing he does not need to put all his focus into his work after his wife's death), when he finds a letter from Will saying he has left to follow Skylar, foreshadowing that Will will continue to lead a successful and in-love life, similar to Sean's. Overall, the script and acting is really what carried this movie, with heartfelt performances from Williams and Damon, and incredibly detailed and articulate writing, helping the audience delve deeper into Damon's character.",

Their chemistry is very strong and the ideas and values they talk about are both fascinating and engaging. I wish that this whole film's plot could've just solely been about these two, but disappointingly, the screenplay written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck is too incompetent (it's a good thing they stuck to acting I suppose). In between the thought-provoking scenes involving Damon and Williams is a cliché-ridden story told with characters that are not engaging nor have enough backstory for us, the audience, to care about. All I need to say is that it is a romance plot with the titular character and a girl and there's a misunderstood fight between them and....ugh....yeah. It's that same old 'song and dance' we all achingly know. In fact, the effect the film had on me was a tug-of-war, pulling me back and forth between smart characters with smart dialogue and dumb characters with dumb dialogue. I'm teetering on the fence for \"Good Will Hunting\". I want to like this film, but I just can't stomach its amateur plot peppered with intelligent scenes. It (sadly) comes across as Hollywood trying to relate with the smart crowd and failing, which in turn, makes for a phony film.",
