    "critic_reviews": [
        "In As Good as It Gets, his (Brooks) mastery of the nuances of language and emotion has turned the most unlikely material into the best and funniest romantic comedy of the year.",
        "What Brooks manages to do with them as they struggle mightily to connect with one another is funny, painful, beautiful, and basically truthful--a triumph for everyone involved.",
        "Nicholson, Hunt, and Kinnear will win you over as they turn the film into a valentine to New York's walking wounded.",
        "It's a case of actors and strong writing coming together, and it's uncommon in contemporary movies.",
        "As funny as it's got all year.  Manipulative and calculating? Sure. Submit! Enjoy!",
        "It all adds up to a compelling, deftly executed film that thoughtfully examines the actions and motivations that draw people together, directing their uneasy relationships.",
        "The result takes the audience on a screwball odyssey that mixes engaging twists with off-putting turns -- often fun, always watchable, but never quite as good as it could be.",
        "There's so much good here, in the dialogue, the performances and the observation, that the movie succeeds at many moments even while pursuing its doomed grand design.",
        "The movie often verges on being too much; Brooks' supreme balancing act is to keep it all under control.",
        "Not a positive triumph, but it does bring a smile to the face and, perhaps in some cases, a tear to the eye.",
        "Appreciate it instead as an exceedingly well-crafted fairy tale, alive with eccentric, overdrawn Dickensian characters and irresistibly wholehearted sentiment, and you'll enjoy perhaps the most accomplished and satisfying work of Brooks' career as a middlebrow entertainer.",
        "A cute premise that, upon closer inspection, rings falser rather than truer. It's pretty good, but not nearly as good as Brooks gets.",
        "A sporadically funny romantic comedy with all the dramatic plausibility and tonal consistency of a TV variety show.",
        "Wicked, but it works.",
        "As Good as It Gets works: by the end you'll no doubt be won over by its cranky hero. But for those of us who cherish the quirkily unformulaic Brooks of old, it's a tainted victory.",
        "The material has no dramatic center, a problem pointed up by Brooks' failed solution to it -- his use of an ugly-cute little dog, Simon's pet.",
        "Gets bogged down in sentimentality, while its wheels spin futilely in life-solving overdrive.",
        "An overstatement. The movie's too long, and the direction is sometimes slack -- but the script is crammed with withering ripostes, ably delivered by Nicholson and Hunt.",
        "Nicholson's over-the-top acting gives an entertaining edge to the plot's feel-good manipulations.",
        "In between all the laughs and tears, it becomes painfully obvious that there's not a whole lot of story here to prop up the constant emotional yanking.",
        "Experiencing this movie is a little like watching a manic-depressive's medication wear off."

The writing, the acting, the risk-taking. It does an incredible job of presenting the character complexity of three 'broken' people which start to be healed by each other through, well friendship / love. The thing that is so cool is there are no actual 'one-liners' per say. The comedy is about the irony of the characters and the situation of the scene itself. For instance, Melvin Udall has no clue how to deal with normal social situations, causing rage reactions from everything that comes out of his mouth, yet he's a successful 'romance novelist' that understands the heart and head of woman \u2014 subtle but super hilarious!

Can they be any better? Director James L Brook's speciality is exploring the human psyche, emotions and portrayals of these many emotions and parts. Nicholson's Melvin Udall is  an obsessive-compulsive disorder, frantic and unstable-yet-stable in his ways in life. I liked how Hunt gave life to her Carol Conelly's single mom-waitress act. I was a tad disappointed at the way how Carol's new boyfriend starts to make out - it just didn't fit with the Carol I saw, the Carol who's working many shifts to ensure that she has the money to afford her little boy's asthma treatment, as well as making sure she can also afford the day-to-day finance of her house, where her mom also lives in. I enjoyed Kinnear's 'Simon the **** portrayal, his subtle movements, his manner of speech and delivery, and his physical presence. Cuba Gooding has a very few scenes in the movie, but is no less memorable. I somehow felt that the second half was a little dull compared to the first, but maybe that's because the early fun of seeing Melvin Udall's 'disgrace of a human being' starts to mellow out, and the actual evolution of the movie's plot begins to grow. The screenplay was just strong enough for the material and characters at hand. Obviously, one cannot take one's eyes off Nicholson whenever he's on the screen, whether explaining in such clever sarcasm to Greg about why he works alone at night, or handling Greg's maid, or even when Carol confronts him with the 'you crazy ....' after he tells her quite insensitively that 'we all die, and from what I hear, your son will too'. It's hilarious and its hurtful, but that's the best part - Melvin Udall is a single man, and it's because of a reason - he's just impossible to get along with. It's not for a lack of trying, it's just that he has never met anyone who could show him the mirror and pick out the flaws in his face. Enter Carol, let the movie take its course, and you'll see just how one can change when one is receptive to one's environment. \"You make me wanna be a better man\" isn't just your standard movie cliched lines, it actually is resonant of Melvin's feelings towards Carol, and it is deeply moving how their relationship evolves and grows. Melvin's attachment to Simon's dog over time is moving and natural. Melvin feels something inside and he is grateful that he has a visitor in his house, and it is disturbingly pleasant. I've seen this movie time and again, because it is Nicholson and Hunt at their very best, and Brooks' direction at its most truthful and honest core.",

The characteristics of the characters are well crafted and detail that offers more personal experience to the viewers since it goes way too deep and bisects it wisely by comparing it with others; a masterstroke by the writers to meddle with the audience subconsciously. It's parallel tracks are given equal importance with fine polishing around the edges that is decorated by the three dimensional characters that resides in this typical New York neighborhood. The background score by Zimmer is impressive, the cinematography is decent if not extraordinary but has fine editing and camera work that is breezy and light and is uplifted by music that plays vital role in order to elevate the momentum. Nicholson is in his A game where he redefines his throne and proves why he still is the best of all and on the other end, Hunt is equally challenging and replies to his all serves with a winning shot where both of them are supported nicely by Kinnear and Gooding Jr. The narration is elaborative and not stretchy with adaptive tone that unfortunately wears off in its latter stages as it loses its grip on settling for a mellow course. Brooks's execution is what fuels this familiar drama and offers a fresher perspective to it that is brimmed with tiny cathartic notions that are just pills for adrenaline rush to the audience. Ticking for more than two hours and fixating on a singular topic, it is surprisingly intriguing enough to keep us invested in it. The dry humoristic tone of each character, the morale conflicts and their answer to it and Nicholson and Hunt's stellar performances are the high points of the feature. As Good As It Gets is actually as good as cinema can get on terms of the craft it carries out from mundane events.",

Both Jack and Helen Hunt put in great performances that were worthy of praise. My main niggle is that it is way too long; it could have easily been shortened by at least 20 minutes and that would have maybe given it a little more punch.

That is, he is virtually a hermit, who lives confined at home and has fits of rage if forced to escape his routine or socialize with the people around him. The most regular victims of Udall's caustic and rude temper are his gay neighbor Simon, his dog Verdel, and Carol, the waitress who serves him coffee every day, always at the same table, and which he eats. using plastic cutlery that you bring with you. Everything changes with the robbery of Simon's house: confined to a bed, wounded and broke, Simon becomes partially dependent on Melvin, who will gradually learn to do acts of kindness and generosity towards the people he has hurt.The cast is led by Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt, two proven actors, who here manage to give us two excellent performances. Personally, I thought Hunt was too young to be a love interest for Nicholson, but the fact is that they both seem to be totally at ease with the characters and also with each other. Greg Kinnerar gives us an equally mature and consistent work, in which he is assisted by Cuba Gooding Jr. And a final word for the excellent dog used in the film.Technically, it's a standard film, within most Hollywood works. It has good cinematography and editing, with good colors and a very safe pace. The scenarios used are very good, with a natural highlight for Melvin's apartment. The soundtrack fulfills its role well and there is a lot of situational comedy to make the most serious audience laugh.",
