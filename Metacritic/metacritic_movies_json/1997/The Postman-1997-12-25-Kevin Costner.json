    "critic_reviews": [
        "Although The Postman conveys a thoroughly imagined vision of a future society, its basic concerns are actually far from those of traditional sci-fi, as it quickly comes to feel more like a Western than anything else.",
        "If you take The Postman at face value - that it's a straightforward, post- apocalyptic adventure tale, then it could seem like one of the worst movies of the year, if not of all time.",
        "It's tempting to accuse director and star Kevin Costner of taking the idea of vanity production to a new level in this frontier adventure based on a book by David Brin.",
        "Regrettably, The Postman is just one more reminder of what a nonfactor sincerity often is in terms of artistic merit.",
        "The Postman isn't as atrocious as the inane trailers and media hype have indicated, but like \"Waterworld\" a lot of the prerelease scrutiny is well warranted.",
        "Costner's ponderous post-apocalyptic morality tale feels every minute of its nearly three hours.",
        "There are those who will no doubt call The Postman the worst film of the year, but it's too good-hearted for that.",
        "But since Costner can\u00edt save his movie, it's something of a stretch to think he might be able to save the world.",
        "Goofy and gee-whiz when it isn't being post-apocalyptic glum, it is such an earnest hodgepodge that only by imagining \"Mad Max\" directed by Frank Capra can you get even an inkling of what it's like.",
        "The dragging pace is one of several agonizing defects in this bloated sci-fi action drama.",
        "The story takes place in 2013, but you'd hardly know it from the age-old clich\u00e9s Kevin Costner purloins to tell this overblown action yarn, which relies so heavily on ideas borrowed from John Ford westerns that the Hollywood giant should have been credited as codirector; too bad Costner can't invest them with Ford's kind of life and originality, though.",
        "What willful streak of perversity inspired Kevin Costner to take on this wacky tale of a letter carrier-turned-postapocalyptic hero?",
        "Director-star Kevin Costner falls head over heels in love with himself in this nihilistic, post-apocalyptic clunker about a loner who becomes a reluctant sperm donor, role model and inevitably a godsend to what's left of America.",
        "Every truly awful movie epic has a point of no return, a moment when the accumulated bad lines and bogus sentimentality become so cloying that the best defense against a mounting queasiness is an awed amusement.\r\nThe Postman, offers a new opportunity for levity every few minutes after its first hour."

Communities have become isolated, there is no government, United States seems to have disappeared and armed militias on horseback are oppressing the people. However, a man will change that when, somewhat accidentally, it triggers a movement of resistance to oppression.The center of all history is the way a man, with no name but who is nicknamed \"Shakespeare\" due to his survival as an artist and itinerant declamer, ends up giving rise to a movement of resistance to a strong and fierce armed militia, when he disguises himself as a postman to be able to receive help from the people, averse to the visit of strangers. He comes to be seen as a symbol of hope when he lies, assuming himself as a representative of a Restored Government, which does not even know whether it exists or not.The central idea is great, and the film is interesting by the ideas it presents and by the good work of the leading actors, Kevin Costner and Will Patton. The two actors worked well and their characters are very interesting. Costner gave life to a hero by chance, full of internal conflicts and a complex psychology that he managed to explore; Patton was an insensitive and bloodthirsty villain, cultured but cruel. The sub-plot created between the Postman and Abby turns out little and does not seem very happy by the way she quickly forgets her husband. But worse are the three hours lenght, which are not justified by the plot and denounce a bad post-production and editing work. There's a lot left in this movie and lots of details that don't matter and should have been taken off. Another problem is the time when everything is happening: the year 2013. Okay, the movie was shot in 1997, but we're in 2018 today, and it seems silly that they thought of a future so near as something so apocalyptic. The film should have been thought for 2113, not 2013.Despite all the flaws, the film is interesting and tells a good story of freedom, resistance to oppression and tyranny, survival and companionship. Despite the long lenght, it entertains who has not watched it, but its not worth more than two or three views.",
