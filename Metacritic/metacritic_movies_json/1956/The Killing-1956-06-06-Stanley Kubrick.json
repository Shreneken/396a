    "Orson Welles was so taken with this film that after seeing it he declared Kubrick could do no wrong; not to be missed.",
    "The kind of Swiss-watch precision and attention to detail that would eventually get Kubrick labeled Hollywood's most notorious perfectionist.",
    "As good as the story and direction are, though, the true strength of The Killing lies in the characters and characterizations.",
    "Stanley Kubrick was always infatuated with human clockwork, both in terms of what makes each of us tick and how we choreograph our lives, deaths, and sins. The Killing, his big heist movie, suits this obsession perfectly. It is often considered, and rightly, his first masterpiece.",
    "Even though he was just staring out, Kubrick instantly mastered the crime genre. A stunning film.",
    "The word that occurs to me in describing Kubrick's approach to Johnny and the film, is \"control.\" That may suggest the link between this first mature feature and Kubrick's later films, so varied and brilliant.",
    "From the heroes’ complicated planning to the story’s cruel twist ending, The Killing illustrates how human beings have a bad habit of getting in their own way.",
    "One of the great devils of 1950s American cinema.",
    "Characteristically Kubrick in both its mechanistic coldness and its vision of human endeavour undone by greed and deceit, this noir-ish heist movie is nevertheless far more satisfying than most of his later work, due both to a lack of bombastic pretensions and to the style fitting the subject matter.",
    "Thematically, The Killing anticipates themes, motifs and incidents to come in Kubrick’s oeuvre, most famously the notion of master plans undone by human fallibility, that are also to be found in the tales of fate and life’s absurdity of by his mentors Lang and Huston.",
    "If anything identifies The Killing as a Kubrick picture, it is the movie’s overall sense of fatalism – even as we watch how carefully things are planned, there is a sense of impending doom.",
    "Though The Killing is composed of familiar ingredients and it calls for fuller explanations, it evolves as a fairly diverting melodrama.",
    "This story of a $2 million race track holdup and steps leading up to the robbery, occasionally told in a documentary style which at first tends to be somewhat confusing, soon settles into a tense and suspenseful vein which carries through to an unexpected and ironic windup."

It is a classic heist story with some good characters with their own backgrounds, but also some weak characters that you can foresee how they will end. Anyway it was a good idea not to reveal everything of the heist plan until the end, so there is still something to learn until then. Sterling Hayden as Johnny was perfect.",
