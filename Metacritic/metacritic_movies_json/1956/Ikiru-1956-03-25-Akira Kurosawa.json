  "critic_reviews": [
    "Over the years I have seen \"Ikiru\" every five years or so, and each time it has moved me, and made me think.",
    "A thoughtful, existential meditation about the meaning of life and what constitutes a life well-lived, Ikiru is almost guaranteed to prod the viewer to examine his or her own mortality and ponder how, in the end, the scales will tip.",
    "The genius of Akira Kurosawa’s Ikiru is the way this deeply sentimental film continually deflates sentimentality.",
    "This is the flip side to his samurai films, an introspective, naturalistic contemporary drama combining progressive social criticism with a universal humanist message.",
    "A beautiful and unusually quiet film from one of the world's greatest living directors.",
    "Were it the only film Kurosawa ever made, his name would be rightfully engraved on film history.",
    "It avoids all the maudlin cliches and blind alleys of examining the “meaning of life,” giving us instead a rare portrait of a man experiencing a genuine insight into what his wasted years have been leading to.",
    "Meticulously constructed, beautifully played and poignant.",
    "The narrative is carefully paced, the central performance magnificent, the final effect overwhelming in a manner that recalls the great Russian writers Kurosawa admired.",
    "Kurosawa performs a tour-de-force in keeping a dramatic thread throughout and avoiding the mawkish. It is technically excellent with a telling Occidental-type musical score.",
    "Like “Stray Dog” and “Drunken Angel,” it illuminates a reeling society while telling a story of deep human emotion.",
    "Kurosawa’s eclectic style is a delight: his striking, varied compositions reflecting the old man’s journey from darkness to some kind of light right until the moving finale.",
    "Ikiru wows for its complicated interrogation (and innovation) of subjective, cinematic experiences of time and memory, but lulls in its commemoration of a wealthy, privileged man who finally decides to care after it’s absolutely confirmed he has no time left to live.",
    "If it weren't so confused in its story-telling, it would be one of the major postwar films from Japan. As it stands, it is a strangely fascinating and affecting film, up to a point—that being the point where it consigns its aged hero to the great beyond."
