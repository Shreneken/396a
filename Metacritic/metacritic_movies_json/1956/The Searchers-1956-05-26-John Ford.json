  "critic_reviews": [
    "A meditation on survival, The Searchers is about the loss of faith and the death of heroes.",
    "The Searchers contains scenes of magnificence, and one of John Wayne's best performances.",
    "This C.V. Whitney production is undoubtedly one of the greatest Westerns ever made. For sheer scope, guts and beauty I can think of no picture of the Indian Wars of the Southwest to compare with it.",
    "By the time of The Searchers, Wayne had toughened to match Ford's darker vision. Redemption is still out there, but it has to be fought for, and sometimes winning it doesn't make anyone happier.",
    "A deeply emotional experience that is also a grand entertainment, The Searchers is a true American masterpiece.",
    "In 1956 audiences flocked to The Searchers precisely because it was a John Wayne western, and lapped up its mix of Injun-fightin' action, rough comic knockabout and intense, emotional storyline. Seen now, it is all that and much, much more.",
    "Directed by John Ford, The Searchers is widely recognized not only as the greatest American Western but as one of the best Hollywood films of all-time.",
    "The Searchers gathers the deepest concerns of American literature, distilling 200 years of tradition in a way available only to popular art, and with a beauty available only to a supreme visual poet like Ford.",
    "John Wayne's Ethan is his all-time top performance: funny, romantic, hard-bitten, scary, the personification of machismo.",
    "There is perhaps some discrepancy in the play between Wayne's heroic image and the pathological outsider he plays here, but it hardly matters, given the film's visual splendour and muscular poetry in its celebration of the spirit that vanished with the taming of the American wilderness.",
    "The box office appeal of John Wayne combined with the imprint of John Ford makes The Searchers a contender for the big money stakes. It's a western in the grand scale - handsomely mounted and in the tradition of Shane.",
    "The Searchers is more a look at American genocide and racism, and the poison of revenge-obsession, than it is an adventure movie, and it feels like one of the wisest and most mature Westerns on the classics docket.",
    "Decades before an apologist Western such as Kevin Costner’s Dances with Wolves, The Searchers bluntly addressed this country’s racism toward Native Americans by putting one of Hollywood’s most famous faces on it.",
    "A rip-snorting Western, as brashly entertaining as they come."

The story is extremely simple, they're are some strange plot holes that audiences seemed to gloss over. On top of that, the role of the Native Americans in the story is extremely unrealistic, besides the fact that they are all played by white actors, perhaps excusable because of the times, there antagonistic forces are simply overly evil and hateful, and the are given no real depth. The visuals are gorgeous, and the landscape and set design is immaculate, but the story is hindered.",

Its quite a shout-y film, so if that doesn't appeal then perhaps its best to give this a miss. There are lots of scenes involving male characters fighting with one another, trying to prove each other the better one - that sort of thing. Of course im aware of the, how shall I put it?, non-PCness of such films and I did cringe at scenes where scalps were shown and the idea of the brutal savagery of supposed indians (native Americans) but I can also see that this film may be appreciated as an example of a classic American western too. There were one or two mildly amusing moments present too (such as one when a cowboy is bent over, having to get someone to pull sharp items out of his behind 'did that hurt?' 'no! shutup boy...' that sort of thing).Its definitely cheesy but its not an awful film - its not great, its relatively good, I'd say. I think I enjoyed more than I disliked it, so I'd recommend it on that basis, yes.",
