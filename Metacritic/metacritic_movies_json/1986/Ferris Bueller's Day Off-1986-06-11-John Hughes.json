    "When people think fondly of John Hughes, it's movies like Ferris Bueller that they're thinking of.",
    "This is the funniest teen movie I've seen in eons.",
    "This is John Hughes' best teen film, and it's a call to arms to everyone in the world who doesn't want to follow society's lame-ass rules at the expense of living a cool life.",
    "At its best Ferris Bueller is a free-spirited romp, a devil-may-care respite from grueling dailiness.",
    "The film's heart is in the right place, and Ferris Bueller is slight, whimsical and sweet.",
    "In this film [Hughes] has created a character who is every teen-ager's fantasy, but in the process he has lost some of the authenticity of his other films - leaving several slow transitions or awkward moments.",
    "The story and pacing of this offbeat comedy wear thin after the first 20 minutes.",
    "The overriding impression is one of utter nihilism, as reflected in a world divided into bored, crassly materialistic teenagers on one side and doltish, unfeeling adults on the other.",
    "Paucity of invention here lays bare the total absence of plot or involving situations."

I was directed and written by John Hughes (Home Alone, The Breakfast Club) and with all of his early work it balances comedy right along with the darker moments. It's only flaw is that I think it doesn't quite tie up all the loose ends, which leaves the viewer wondering but I still wanted to see more. Its comedic, dark, and has some of my favourite characters in film.",

Featuring a great performance from Matthew Broderick, a funny script and great direction from John Hughes, and some oddly touching moments, this one has all the ingredients for a success. Luckily, it takes this ingredients and uses them wisely, ending up with a really good comedy. Though it may get a bit outlandish at times, it really captures the end of high school well and honestly just feels like a good time. It is an enjoyable little film that may not be entirely realistic, sure, but it surely delivers in the entertainment department and is a film that you wish would never end, unlike the end of high school, which cannot come soon enough for many. Overall, Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a classic that I am ashamedly just getting around to, however, it was more than worth the wait as it delivered exactly what I was hoping for: a funny high school comedy with some killer writing and acting.",

But what sets this film part as another teen movie is not the premise of the film, but the actual character of Bueller and is influence on his little entourage of classmates and is entire school who hear about his 'illness'.\rFerris orchestrates several ways so as his day off goes smoothly, dummy in the bed, recorded message for the doorbell etc, but a persistent school principal (Jeffrey Jones) may just wreck that.\rThe day really consists of various places that Ferris has clearly wanted to visit, and a very memorable scene at a parade, which is just too enjoyable.\rAlan Ruck also stars as the worrying and depressive Cameron, Ferris' best friend but someone who has issues with his parents. Mia Sara plays Sloane, Ferris' girlfriend, who Ferris manages to get out of school.\rThe movie has all the vintage touches of Hughes, the in-your-face cinematography and the exaggerated moments of simple scenarios with pounding music to signify the scene.\rFerris continuously speaks directly to the camera, this is quite clever in that we see the influence and effect that he has on the other characters and the bigger, overall picture of what is being told, he is narrating the insecurities that teens face in their everyday lives, and what it means to be free, and also the simple case of not having everything doesn't necessarily make him unhappy.\rWhat I feel took the film down though was Hughes excessive use of his dramatised camera techniques, they just become annoying and didn't suit the style of the film at all, and the film could have benefited greatly without them.\rThe message within the film does do the whole feature justice though, dealing with problems head on and looking out for your friends couldn't be more heartfelt in this film. Something as simple as freedom for the youth couldn't be more important, and Matthew Broderick has the perfect face and charm to put across that message. Certainly not an amazing film, but the agenda that the film has is one of the upmost importance and is a nice deterrent from the typical teen films that we are now accustomed to, if you don't stop for a while and admire it, you might just miss it.",

It is rather what a middle age man with bad job would do on his day off. But that 's not my biggest complaint is not that. I don't mind if movie lacks logic or realism as long as it is entertaining.\r My problem was that movie didn't live up to hype it got. I didn't find the movie as entertaining or funny as everyone on internet said nor I didn't find Ferris as cool or likable as everyone thinks.\r First let me talk about the movie. The movie was very dull, boring, slow and uneventful for me. Even the situation that happens are not so entertaining sometime. For example, take museum scene. Sure setting a scene in museum is boring itself.But that is not a big problem. A good director can make a scene set in boring classroom interesting. What makes this scene boring is that characters do nothing. They do not do any mischief, they do not destroy anything, they do not do prank or the fact that do not give any witty remarks on any painting. They just stand and stare the painting. Instead camera shows the paintings. If I had to see the painting, I would use my internet to Google some painting or if I don't have internet, I would simply go to public library and read a book about painting. When fun thing actually happen i.e.; watching baseball game , they don't show much. Only time I laughed was when Ed Rooney was humiliated.\r Now let me talk about Ferris Bueller himself. Even if I forget he lies and manipulate people who loves him the most, I still don't like this character. I did not find him cool at all. There is no strong reason why he is the most popular kid in school who is worshiped by everyone. Only special thing about him is his unbelievable luck. I found him boring guy who keeps on explaining why is he cool.",

Ferris Bueller's Day Off is immensely fun and likable as both a comedy and a film. It is marred slightly by some of the sentimentality, but the story is engaging and the script is smart and funny. Hughes does a very admirable job directing, and the film also boasts some lovely cinematography and a catchy soundtrack. Then there is the acting, I liked all the performances in this movie. Matthew Broderick indeed plays an arrogant, spoiled and bratty sort of character, but he actually manages to give him some likability too. Alan Ruck is also excellent as his melancholy friend, and Mia Sara is gorgeous as his girlfriend. But it is Jeffrey Jones who almost steals the show as he suffers all those humiliations he goes through. In conclusion, I like it a lot and it is one of Hughes' best. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

I think all teens have felt this urge, and often have, or played sick for one more day toThis movie is a light and fun comedy that takes us back to school days. After all, who hasn't wanted to take a day off and simply enjoy their youth? I think all teens have felt this urge, and often have, or played sick for one more day to themselves. What, surely, will never have happened is something as complex and sophisticated as what Ferris Bueller decided to do.The film is fun and uses a tasteful comedy style, without good resources, able to delight the whole family. John Hughes assures a firm and intelligent direction, who guides the film with skill, combining a creative and intelligent story with a very well written and thought out sense of humor.The still young and inexperienced Matthew Broderick does a good job as the protagonist, and is already showing signs of the talent he will develop in mature works. He knew how to give his character a strong charisma, combined with a rebelliousness and stubbornness typical of a teenager who has been pampered too much. Mia Sara did an equally competent job, even though she's a more cliché character: she's the pretty, popular girlfriend, who's obviously also one of the school's cheerleaders. We find characters like her in virtually every teen comedy! Personally, I didn't like Alan Ruck very much. The actor is good and does what he can, but the character is irritating with all his spoiled rich boy whining. However, it's not just Broderick that makes the movie worthwhile: Jeffrey Jones' incredible work also deserves applause. He gave life to the school principal, who wants to prove that Ferris Bueller is deliberately skipping classes, and at the expense of that, he goes through a series of hilarious situations where, of course, he suffers hard. It's an impressive work by this actor, which makes us laugh until we cry.Technically, it's a film that doesn't have any major demerits, but it also has little that stands out: it has good cinematography, an excellent soundtrack and a series of witty and well-written dialogues, but everything else is within the standard you would expect from a 80s comedy.",

Matthew Broderick's acting (playing as Ferris Bueller) is miraculous: he is always in the right tone, never acts too much, never misses any line ! Yet he an be a jackass sometimes or have a really dumb face but that's all. The rest of cast is iconic with the marvelous Mia Sara and the gorgeous Jennifer Grey.Coming from this kind of comedy movies I didn't expect the characters to evolve that way. If some don't change from start to end (as the principal or Bueller's girlfriend), others change a lot. It's hard to identify if this movie is rather for kids (surely not considering its vulgarity at some point) or teenagers (because some jokes are frankly childish). As an adult you may want to retain some few lessons.I was really skeptical when I understood that the movie wanted to make school look like a horrible boring and brain-washing prison but as the plot moved on I realized things were a bit deeper than that. Of course there are some major critics to the adults world but some other things are just unexcusable, like the fact that Ferris' parents admit they prefer him to his sister, that the police puts someone who is in theorical danger in custody, and that crashing a car is not supposed to be the best way to assume yourself.In conclusion there are some parts looking just like a 'Home Alone' movie and some others that are way more inspired and original.",

Although the extent that Ferris goes to pull off his lie is a little unrealistic, it still adds to the comedic aspect of the film that everyone loves. Overall, I think that John Hughes made another great film and one that has stayed iconic and fun to watch, even over 30 years after it premiered.",

My favorite scene was definitely the parade scene. Only thing I didn't enjoy about the movie is Mr. Rooney. He's one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen and he bothered me so much throughout the course of the movie.",

This movie is a comedy about a teenage boy ditching school to have a fun day. Pretty much any teenagers dream come true. Most people know someone in their life who is a lot like Ferris Bueller, someone who is fun, goofy, spontaneous and rule breaking. I love this comedy film, mainly because of Ferris and Cameron's friendship. The energy of the movie is so upbeat and fun. It's a great movie for family movie nights.",
