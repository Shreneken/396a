        "Isabella Rossellini\u2019s singer Dorothy is a heart-rending open wound, Dennis Hopper\u2019s Frank Booth one of cinema\u2019s great nutjobs, and Lynch\u2019s control a thing of nightmarish beauty.",
        "Blue Velvet is David Lynch in peak form, and represents (to date) his most accomplished motion picture. It is a work of fascinating scope and power that rivals any of the most subversive films to reach the screens during the '80s.",
        "The last real earthquake to hit cinema was David Lynch's \"Blue Velvet\" -- I'm sure directors throughout the film world felt the earth move beneath their feet and couldn't sleep the night of their first encounter with it back in 1986.  (Review of 20th Anniversary Re-Release)",
        "What dazzles still about David Lynch's Blue Velvet is its total authority: Not a single false gesture. No shock delivered solely for its own sake.",
        "Hopper creates a flabbergasting portrait of unrepentent, irredeemable evil.",
        "It's mostly fascinating, though the unconverted may be in for a rough two hours.",
        "Doesn't progress or deepen, it just gets weirder, and to no good end.",
        "So strong, so shocking and yet so audacious that people walk out shaking their heads; they don't know quite what to make of it."

Its surrealism aspects may swiftly guide some away, but the others that stay are truly in for a surprising film. The plot focuses on Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle McLachlan) a young man that ventures down to his hometown of Lumberton after his father suffers a severe stroke. After visiting him in the hospital he ventures his way home, taking a shortcut through an abandoned field. There he finds the remains of a human ear and takes it to the police. After some investigating, Jeffrey finds his way into the grasp of a strange woman named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) who develops an unusual attraction towards Jeffrey. He then begins to stalk her a little, and the story kicks off from there. Jeffrey comes to a close encounter with the main antagonist of the story, Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper). He is a violent sociopath that snorts amyl nitrite through a gas mask, which triggers him to experience constant amounts of pleasure and rage and inflict mass amounts of sexual anger towards Dorothy. Frank has kidnapped Dorothy's son and husband in exchange for her to be his sexual servant. Jeffrey discovers this and tries to help her get them back. While this plot sounds strange and complex, it's actually supposed to be. That's what makes this film so brilliant. It's emotionally charged atmosphere and characters pulls you in to experience the surrealism that is inflicted upon these characters. Directed by David Lynch, who is a master himself at surrealism, presents the film in such a strange and bizarre film that it's completely hard to imagine what's going on. The film itself is beautiful because of this as I have truly never seen a movie as original and as creative as this. While Blue Velvet is criticized due to the fact of the sexual aspects of Rossellini and how awful she's treated during the span of the film, it actually shows how broken she is and the amount of pain and suffering she would go through in order to maintain her peace and to make her way back to her son and husband. A lot of people tend to spew hate on the film because they tend to think that it's trying to go for a realistic approach. In any means it is NOT. The acting is great from the 3 main leads and the strongest role definitely goes to Hopper. Frank Booth is indeed a creepy, creepy villain. It's one of the late Dennis Hopper's best performances in a film as he is both haunting and hilarious. All in all Blue Velvet is a tough film to swallow, its contents are both graphic and surreal. Its a brilliant film that makes you think of the inevitable, that makes you think of what is real, and what is the surreal.",

In a town overwhelmed by bright white picket fences, blood red fire trucks, and carefully pruned roses, there's something especially grotesque about a man having a heart attack on his front lawn while his cocker spaniel laps spraying water from the hose still clinging to his hand.\r Blue Velvet is a film about the reality and streams of subconscious desire seething beneath a preposterously idealistic vision of America. Jeffrey discovers a severed, ant-infested human ear near a grassy trail (Lynch's homage to Bu\u00f1uel's Un Chien Andalou), bringing it to the attention of the local police chief. With the help of Sandy (Laura Dern), a voyeuristic girl-next-door who emerges hauntingly from the shadows and promises her devotion to his mission, Jeffrey breaks into the apartment owned by an emotionally frayed chanteuse, Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rosselini, doing her best impersonation of a living china doll). Forget for a moment that MacLachlan is Lynch's doppelganger here.\r Lynch is less concerned with self-reference than he is with charting the uncomfortable crawlspace between boyhood and manhood. The many rooms of Blue Velvet are fascinatingly representative of internal moods: the white walls of the virginal Sandy's home; the garish blues and vaginal pinks of Dorothy's kitschy modern apartment; and the cluttered, homely look of the Beaumont home. Jeffrey innocently woes Sandy with an okey-dokey \u201cchicken walk\u201d before the officer's daughter speaks of a dream where darkness fell upon the face of the earth because there were no robins. It's all set to the sounds of Angelo Badalmenti's brilliant TV-noir score, which evokes everything from the wide-eyed glee of '50s pop (Roy Orbison and Bobby Devlin, whose \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d was the inspiration for the film) to divine religious hymnals. In a town where Awake magazines are readily associated with Jehovah's Witnesses, Dennis Hopper's Frank becomes a kind of satanic assault on normalcy. He's a rapist and kidnapper and if Dorothy's desire to be physically hit by Jeffrey is any indication, Frank's perversion easily spreads. But, then again, Lynch seems to suggest that love is as potent in Frank's fetishistic strange world as it is in Sandy's happy-go-lucky one.\r Even when the robins do return to Lumberton, Lynch still forces his characters to acknowledge the grotesque backside of their idyllic worldviews.",

Congress should pass a law declaring that if David Lynch ever tries to make another movie he should be drawn and quartered. I decided to watch this movie after seeing that it was one of the American Film Institutes top 100 movies of all time. AFI even said it was even one of the top 10 mystery films of all times. The big mystery is who supports this crap. I'll give you the play by play of this movie as I watch it. It has the worst sound track of any \"serious\" movie ever made. Some of the songs are good songs, I love Roy Orbison etc.. But they are all out of place. The acting in this movie is horrible. The dork main character chews up the scenery. And then there is Dennis Hopper. Hopper is the worst actor of all time. He ruins ever movie he has ever made. Think about it. Apocalypse Now was awesome until Hopper shows up. Hoosiers might have been a good movie if he had not been cast. This movie is definitely no exception. It has one of the worst/weirdest scene ever in any movie. Dennis Hopper (have I told you how much I hate this asshole?) starts sniffing something, (oxygen?, glue?, his underwear?) and rapes Isabella Rossellini while he yells for his mommy. Damn, I need a shower. This movie is just full of unnecessary sexual violence. Why does that damn curtain keep flapping? And what is with the 25 times the actors say or drink a Heineken? \"Heineken? Fuck that shit! Pabst Blue Ribbon!\" That is a line delivered ham fisted, straight from the movie. This ranks right down there with Muhalland Drive, another David Lynch movie, that is the worst movie ever made. Is that guy dancing with a snake? More underwear sniffing, and then Hopper puts on lipstick? Man this movie is bad? Roy Orbison's estate should sue for slander. To quote an Orbison song played during this movie, \"I can't help it if I cry,\" at how bad this movie is. Oh shit, the man in the yellow coat is a cop! I didn't see that coming. Also, what year did this take place? Most of the cars are from the late 50's, and a few from the 60's. The main dork dresses like it's 1982, but everyone else dresses like it's 1962. The dork sure does heal well. First he's stabbed in the face, (and that appears and reappears trough out) and then he is nearly beaten to death and then the next day he is fully healed. WTF? I didn't see that coming. David Lynch convinced Isabella to get naked and beat up one more time. Wouldn't you just take her to the hospital, not to your girlfriends house? What the hell?!? Now the guy with the yellow coat is standing there, and he's dead, standing? What in the world is Dennis Hopper sniffing? Sorry about the long rant but I can't say enough about how bad this movie is. Don't just take my word for it. From wikipedia: Roger Ebert, noted film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times, supports my view, although he praised Isabella Rossellini's performance as being \"convincing and courageous\". Ebert criticized how she was depicted in the film, even accusing David Lynch of misogyny: \"degraded, slapped around, humiliated and undressed in front of the camera. And when you ask an actress to endure those experiences, you should keep your side of the bargain by putting her in an important film\" David Lynch you put your disease in me.",

A man collapses while watering his lawn, and the camera, after following him to the ground, burrows into it--parting the blades of grass to reveal a colony of swarming bugs. The message is clear  perfection often hides deeply-rooted rot. Dreams can easily turn into nightmares. Corruption is everywhere, even in places that seem immune to it. These themes, and others about the pernicious influence of evil, are explored in some depth throughout \"Blue Velvet\".\r Returning home to visit his father who is in intensive care at the hospital, Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), stumbles upon a human ear he finds in a field. With local police detective Williams showing little interest to investigate, Jeffrey and Sandy (Laura Dern), Detective Williams's daughter, decide to do their own investigation. But what Jeffrey and Sandy's investigation leads them to discover that a dark underworld exists in their hometown. Jeffrey becomes suspicious of nightclub singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), who is involved with Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), an unstable violent man. Dennis delivers a genuinely disturbing performance. There is a dark obsessiveness to \"Blue Velvet\"  one that lingers long after the details of the film's mundane drug and kidnapping plot fade away. One is absorbed in the way that David Lynch draws Ivy League college kid Kyle MacLachlan down into a web of voyeurism, rape, sadomasochism and erotic tension. Perhaps the most fascinating thing about \"Blue Velvet\" is how it literally becomes a journey into darkness  how as Kyle MacLachlan becomes drawn into the web.\r A truly eccentric and unsettling observation of the underlining, unspoken aspects behind the facade of any town, USA. \"Blue Velvet\" isn't a film for everyone. It has such an ominous, erotic nuance that disturbs, which has come to define his critically acclaimed work over the years. People who like straight forward storytelling where the journey from point A to point B is laid out for them won't be fans of \"Blue Velvet\". Much like Jeffrey, it's up to you to decide whether you fall into the former or the latter group.",

That is mainly because the acclaim it got from when it first came out does not really translate to present day, and so one would tend to get an impression and have expectations that the film is not going to match. It has been so many years and nowadays the vibe of the film is different. At the same time, it really is a good film and perhaps can be better appreciated not for being outrageous or frightening, but rather for some fine filmmaking and acting. In particular, loved the set for the female lead's apartment the performance by the actress playing her was quite good. The film has many memorable bits and pieces, but the overall vibe is about half as intense as watching an accident involving two vehicles with the highest safety rating and everyone has on their seatbelts. This sounds like it is bad, but it is not. Like I said, it is hard to write a review for. This is really a very good, a very theatrical film; and it is good to see, not so much for shocks and frights, but to appreciate a nice piece of work.",

The writing is witty, exhilarating and gripping throughout the course of it where if plotted a graph there barely would be a dip somewhere in its second act which is feasible. The technical aspects like background score is up beating and horrifying and is perfectly edited too. David Lynch; the writer-director, once again proves his excellence and passion towards the art of the cinema through his brilliant execution skills which holds the audience on the edge of the seat, rooting for more even after the curtain drops. The performance level is satisfactorily filled in by Kyle MacLachlan, Isabella Rossellini and Laura Dern as a supporting cast. The only minor conflict in this feature is the definite point that it fails to make despite of building it up to such a peak where the audience feels vulnerable and surrendered to the world depicted in here. Blue Velvet is a smooth and satisfying experience in terms of craft that is explored in here and the thrill it offers along with it.",

He has a technique and a style that is his alone, and where the seemingly perfect world that we see with the naked eye often coexists, promiscuously, with all the rot that only inDavid Lynch is not a director who appeals to everyone. He has a technique and a style that is his alone, and where the seemingly perfect world that we see with the naked eye often coexists, promiscuously, with all the rot that only in nightmares we can imagine. He is a director who likes to take what is apparently perfect and immaculate and show the rotten hidden side. And that is precisely what we see in this film, which is not perfect but it is difficult to remain indifferent.This film could be seen as an adult fable as the protagonist, a young man named Jeffrey Beaumont, feels compelled to take curiosity to the last consequences after finding an ear cut in a field. When starting an investigation parallel to the police, he discovers links between the ear he found and a bar singer who lives in isolation, and to whom a mobster kidnapped her husband and son to use her as a sexual object in bizarre erotic fantasies.For me, this film is quite surreal and creates around its story and its characters a purposefully surreal and dreamlike environment, as if it were telling us a dream or nightmare. This helps us to understand the biggest problem of the film: the lack of logic in the behavior of characters. On the one hand, we have a young man who feels so curious that he is unable to understand that he is going too far. It does not control himself, just as we do not control ourselves when we are dreaming. On the other hand we have Dorothy Vallens, a deeply sexualized singer who acts incoherently, but who can perfectly symbolize the erotic fantasies repressed in a dream. To top it off we have Frank, the most obvious psychopathic killer in cinema, with random, perverted behavior that screams instead of talking, but that expresses all the anger that we often dare to express only in dreams.The cult status that the film has achieved over time and the way it catapulted David Lynch's career has allowed the actors to have benefited equally. Kyle MacLachlan achieves quite a good performance. Isabella Rossellini also gives us one of the most important roles in her career, despite having a forced and irritating accent. Dennis Hooper was good at bringing Frank to life and looks really menacing. There is still space to mention Laura Dern's good performance, in a sweet and very restrained paper.Technically, it is a colossal film and where cinematography has been used masterfully. There are a lot of truly impressive camera angles and shooting plans, particularly at the beginning and end of the film. The use of color and light, and later the shadow and night, were elements that Lynch knew how to make the most of. Not being a film where the effects have a lot of time, we have time to appreciate the sets, thought in detail, the choice of some colors and the way some characters connect to them (think, for example, that the Dorothy's apartment is dominated by warm colors like red, and the rich symbology surrounding the blue velvet robe). Another detail that was meticulously thought out was the soundtrack, truly impressive and a welcome help in creating the environment.",

It is most certainly not meant to be a straight-up thriller, that's just an absurd idea. Also, you can't properly judge it by seeing it only once, I've seen it maybe 5 times now (going to see the new 35mm print tonight at Film Forum! Ohhhhh yeah!), and am only now beginnign to be able to get a handle on its full dimensions. On the issue of its aging well or not, the NY Times and I agree it has held up amazingly well. It's probably the best thing Hoppers' done. Rossellini is astonishing. Also, one must never forget that it contains one of the most talked about, memorable scenes in all of cinema, not just American: Rossellini's totally unexpected nude appearance, which shocks on about 3 or 4 levels. Most people don't see how absolutely hilarious it is. It's really a dark comedy. The idea (if you can call it that) seems to be simplistic (there's good and bad in the world going on simultaneously), but there are layers to it that can be penetrated and yeld much more complex meanings and suggestions. The young characters enter the dark world that's always been there, next to their light one. They emerge, changed forever, but manage not to be seduced into the underworld. This is modern, American mythology. And it's damn well made, stupendously entertaining stuff to boot! Lynch hasn't really matched it, though Wild at Heart came close, and I am amazed at how few people saw and appreciated Fire Walk with Me. Only Kubrick, Allen and Welles surpass Lynch in importance among American filmmakers. Not enough people agree with this, but time will correct that error.",

On paper itHaving absolutely loved Mulholland Dr., I was keen to see more of Lynch's films. This predecessor, while exhibiting a lot of the filmmaking chops that in part made the former so enjoyable, is unrewarding and at times grotesque. On paper it sounds great: an innocent young man gets tangled in the hidden criminal and erotic underworld that you'd never guess was there in his picturesque town. Some of the representations of this latent darkness are great (the shot zooming into the well-trimmed lawn to reveal a sea of gnashing bugs is inspired and very creepy), and indeed these two halves to the film are in themselves believable (Hopper's villain is nightmarish and feral, the ordinary citizens quaint and unassuming; which is unsettling in its own way). But whereas Mulholland Dr. took me through all the emotional reactions I can think of, the scenes here where these contrasting sides met only made me feel nauseous and uncomfortable (a naked and bruised woman lingering awkwardly in a family's front room, for example). Lynch's talents were evident here, and overall I admired it for its hard-hitting and challenging mission statement, but while I really wanted to love this movie I feel that, with its garish and even repulsive confrontations, it did its best to put me off.",

As somebody who loves Lynch and a lot of his films(the only one I've disliked is Dune), Blue Velvet is up there at the top. The Elephant Man(never has there been a film that moved me more) may be my personal favourite but Blue Velvet is quite possibly Lynch's masterpiece. Loved Mulholland Drive as well, but it is not as accessible as Elephant Man or Blue Velvet- films that even those who aren't fans of Lynch are likely to love- and is his most polarising most likely.Blue Velvet is an incredible-looking film. All of Lynch's films are beautifully shot and that is true of Blue Velvet as well, and the imagery is both hauntingly surreal and beautiful, all the different colours really popping out at you. The music is hypnotic with a very haunting undercurrent and really adds to the story's strangeness and mystery elements. The script is thoughtful and cohesive with a dose of weird but subtle humour as well as some deliberately not so subtle parts(especially with villain Frank Booth). The atmosphere created is the very meaning of scintillating and suspense levels are to the maximum. The story- one of the most coherent and accessible of any Lynch film- is always interesting and entertaining, the detective story elements are genuinely suspenseful and at times scary, Lynch has never directed a tenser scene than the climax here.Lynch's direction is superb; along with Mulholland Drive it contains some of his best. The characters all serve a point to the story and they are very interestingly written, in the case of Frank Booth, one of the most evil and fascinating villains on films, iconic. The acting is superb as well, especially with Dennis Hopper who's terrifyingly sadistic and sometimes hilarious, he is very over the top but in a gleefully enjoyable way. Kyle MacLachlan has never been in a better film or given a better performance than here, he's certainly not had a character as interesting either, Laura Dern is great and sensual Isabella Rossellini has a challenging role that she plays to truly devastating effect. Look out for an oddball but memorable appearance from Dean Stockwell as well. Overall, a strange but utterly mesmerising masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox",
