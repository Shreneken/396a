  "critic_reviews": [
    "Though Aliens is unable to eschew some obvious sci-fi conventions and those of other genres as well, it brings a fresh and lively spirit to this tired cinematic clime. Scene to scene, encounter to encounter, its tension builds unrelentingly. So, fasten your seat belts. It`s a blast.",
    "Aliens is one of the most intensely shocking films to open in ages: Even if you think you've got the stamina for cinematic suspense, you may find yourself out in the lobby, midway, catching your breath. This film is also the best monster movie of the year and the best picture of any kind to open so far this summer. Put it another way: Aliens is the Jaws of the '80s.",
    "A nonstop, high-tech, souped-up war movie, with gung ho marines blasting special-effects creatures, and a genuinely convincing, exciting action heroine.",
    "Tautly paced and expertly directed, this roller coaster ride of a motion picture offers a little bit of everything, all wrapped up in a tidy science fiction/action package.",
    "For this movie stands to be something its predecessor was not, a megahit. And it deserves to be, for it is a remarkable accomplishment: a sequel that exceeds its predecessor in the reach of its appeal while giving Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore.",
    "Truly great cinema- manages to dodge that 'dodgy sequel' curse with ease.",
    "There is always an interesting tension in Cameron's work between masculine and feminine qualities. When it finally hits the fan here, we're in for the mother of all battles.",
    "I'm giving the movie a high rating for its skill and professionalism and because it does the job it says it will do. I am also advising you not to eat before you go to see it.",
    "But of all the film's choices, the best was Weaver. She's its white-hot core, given fine, irascible dialogue to come blazing out of that patrician mouth, and the chance to look, for a moment, like a space-dusted Sleeping Beauty in her hyper-sleep casket.",
    "Director James Cameron dumps the decorative effects of Ridley Scott's 1979 Alien in favor of some daring narrative strategies and a tight thematic focus.",
    "James Cameron's vault into the big time after scoring with the exploitation actioner The Terminator makes up for lack of surprise with sheer volume of thrills and chills - emphasis is decidedly on the plural aspect of the title.",
    "The startling thing about \"Aliens\" is how obsessed it is with women as child bearers. It's  the theme that allows the movie to have all the trappings of a typical science fiction/action movie while creating a primal emotive connection for the audience.",
    "Under the direction of James (''The Terminator'') Cameron, [the special effects team has] put together a flaming, flashing, crashing, crackling blow-'em-up show that keeps you popping from your seat despite your better instincts and the basically conventional scare tactics.",
    "Cameron isn't as concerned with scares or atmosphere, the staples of traditional horror films, as he is with setting up difficult situations for his characters to get out of, leaving audiences deliciously on edge.",
    "Cruder than the original, Aliens is a distinctly greedy mega-production.",
    "Toward the end, the film resorts to placing a young girl in jeopardy in a pathetic attempt to pander to who knows what audience. Some people have praised the technical excellence of Aliens. Well, the Eiffel Tower is technically impressive, but I wouldn`t want to watch it fall apart on people for two hours."

      "content": "\"In space no one can hear you scream\". This was the tagline for the 1979 cult classic movie Alien. Well now its new tagline is, \"This time it's war\". When I first saw Alien, I was blown away completely by its intense story, great special\"In space no one can hear you scream\". This was the tagline for the 1979 cult classic movie Alien. Well now its new tagline is, \"This time it's war\". When I first saw Alien, I was blown away completely by its intense story, great special effects and superb acting, and I thought there is no way they can top this, but I was wrong. Its sequel, Aliens, is as terrifying and exiting, with twice the amount of action. The story takes place 57 years after the events of the first film, where Ripley escaped in the pod and ejected the alien into deep space. Having drifted into space for so long, she is rescued by a bunch of space crew members. Although trying to convince to the executives from her employer the events that occurred, even explaining how her crew got killed, they refuse to believe her and as a result terminate her space flight license. Ripley also discovers that the planet, where her former crew first found the alien, is now home to a colony of co workers, with women and children. Later Ripley is visited by one of the executive staff named Burke and a Lieutenant, who informs her that they have lost contact with the colony on the planet. They plan to send a number of marines, led by the Lieutenant, to investigate what is going on, and they would like Ripley to be their consultant. Hesitant at first, Ripley and Burke come to a deal that as long as they don't bring any unknown creature back to the ship and her space flight license is restored, she will accompany them. Once they land and investigate the colony, the marines discover that the co workers have all been killed by some horrific creature, Ripley suspects with no surprise at all, that this was done by the aliens. They then encounter a survivor, a little girl called Newt who informs them that everyone else is dead. At first in shock and trauma - even refusing to speak to anyone, finally starts talking, but only to Ripley as she somewhat feels more protected around her. Then all hell breaks loose, as the aliens surround the marines, as they attempt to fight them off with their pulse rifles. This film retains its special effects from the first film; there are great shots in out of space (even though we only see bits of them for a few seconds in the first 30 minutes), and of course those fabulous designs of the aliens. They look somewhat a little different, and in my opinion better, than the design for the first alien. The performance from the cast is once superb, especially from Sigourney Weaver; she has really upped her game from the last time. In the first film she was like an outsider from the rest of the crew, but in this one she is really the main star. She's like a female Bruce Willis in the Die Hard movies, because she is more fearless then ever when it comes to facing the aliens, especially the final battle which I will not reveal. Besides Sigourney Weaver, the little girl who plays Newt is bright and delightful; she really does a terrific performance when it comes to those traumatic moments. The bond between Ripley and Newt develops into a Mother and Daughter relationship, and we really care about them more than we do of the others. As well as action and thriller, there's also a real heart to this film. Also the sound effects are brilliant; I love the sound that comes out from those pulse rifles. Usually when it comes to sequels, all they do is copy all the ideas from the first film and rip themselves off the next time. At the time it came to the conclusion that sequels could never be as good, or better, and Aliens could have easily fallen into the same trap, but for once it didn't. James Cameron, remembered from making the brilliant Sci-fi 1984 movie Terminator, has not only directed, but also written an unbelievable script. I gave full credit to him for coming up with the idea of this incredible new story, I really think it's that good to be up there on one of those top 10 best Sci-fi action movies of all time. This is defiantly one of the best I have seen in all movies that I have watched in my time.",

While the first one was more about the fear that arises in people in the face of an unknown and deadly danger, this was more about an all out open warfare between humans and an overwhelming army of aliens, hence the title. I could see hints of James Cameron's other memorable character, The Terminator, in the Ripley of this instalment.\r I could sympathize with some of the secondary characters, the ones who were well developed, but couldn't care less about the others, who I rightly recognized as cannon fodder from the outset. This time around, a child survivor is thrown into the mix, a girl called Newt. She is a primary character and I found her portrayal very satisfying.\r The action sequences were shot extremely well. They both enthralled and kept the tempo running. James Cameron's direction captures every scene with subtlety and precision, a technique which he improved over time and used in delivering a greater film a few years later in the shape of a sequel to another franchise. But this movie amongst his other works proves beyond any doubt that he has all the makings of a great action director.\r The effects did not necessarily jump out at you. They seemed to be at the same standard as the ones from the original, even though this was made seven years later. The score was slow paced and haunting.\r Ripley seems different from the first movie. She feels like another character. And as it is mainly an action flick, this change is not explored. In Alien, she was a flawed heroine. But here she just fills the boots of a main character, firing guns, killing stuff, and hardly ever pauses for reflection. In essence, she brings nothing new to the table, even though the movie ran for two and a half hours. A lot of this time was spent developing the other characters, some of which were fairly well realized, so some amongst the audience may be more satisfied than I was.\r Why I couldn't give this movie a perfect score has a combination of reasons that ultimately has to do with my personal preference. Cameron is clearly intrigued by ideas and stories of heroic men and women struggling to survive against odds ordinary mankind may not be able to cope with. These larger than life super monsters often create much of the action and drama in many of Cameron's other movies too. Ridley Scott's Alien was a simple science fiction, albeit significantly more plausible, tale about a parasitic alien species who reproduce by inhabiting living organisms and killing them eventually.\r Cameron does not explain how or why these species came into being, where the Queen came from, or what happened to the ship where these eggs were found at the start of the first film. He simply saw an opportunity to expand the idea into a highly charged gun blazing blockbuster. Now I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it. On the contrary I believe his Terminator 2 is amongst the greatest movies ever made. But Terminator series was his own creation and he made it that way. It was his child to mould as he pleased. This was not. Here I was hoping to see a sequel which would continue the story Scott set out to tell, a kind of story which would encourage philosophical discussions.\r I enjoyed the movie for other reasons, though I could not help but feel a little disappointed. I came out of it thinking that Cameron was not capable of delivering a movie that could amaze holding the same concepts the original did. He could have easily retained all the gun fighting and flame throwing but may have dotted the plot with a bit of discussion related to the origin of the species, the engineer species, or anything logical and reasonable he could come up with. If he thought this was not possible, he could have at least addressed the issues by putting the words into the mouth of some character so we would have known that the characters are thinking the same thing but had their hands full.",

Tautly paced and expertly directed, this roller coaster ride of a motion picture offers a little bit of everything, all wrapped up in a tidy science fiction/actionPerhaps the best single word to describe James Cameron's Aliens is relentless. Tautly paced and expertly directed, this roller coaster ride of a motion picture offers a little bit of everything, all wrapped up in a tidy science fiction/action package. From the point when the opening half-hour of exposition ends and the real movie begins, Cameron barely gives viewers a chance to catch their breaths or ease their grips on their armrests as he plunges his characters from one dire situation to the next. This is one of those rare motion pictures that involves the audience so completely in the story that we're as worn out at the end as our on-screen counterparts.\r Aliens takes place a half-century after the events in Alien. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver, reprising her role as the lone survivor from the first outing) has been in cryogenic sleep in outer space, accompanied only by her loyal cat, Jones, until a salvage ship discovers her and brings her back to Earth. There, she finds herself facing serious charges of official misconduct (she was responsible, after all, for the destruction of a space ship) and her claims about the alien are greeted with skepticism. She is stripped of her pilot's license and left to cope on her own with life in the future - a future without her daughter, who recently died of old age. Then, all contact is suddenly lost with the terraforming colony on LV-426 - the planet on which Ripley's crew discovered the alien. A corporation executive, Carter Burke (Paul Reiser), approaches Ripley with a proposition: accompany a military team to LV-426 as an advisor and have her pilot's license restored. She concurs, but with a proviso: they are going there to destroy the aliens, not to harvest them or bring them back. Burke agrees.\r If Aliens was no more than a series of suspenseful, effectively executed action sequences, it would still be a superior motion picture - Cameron's grasp of what gives an audience a jolt of adrenaline is that masterful. However, the element that elevates Aliens into the sparsely populated stratosphere of great science fiction movies is character identification. We care about what happens to the men and women populating this film. Even the supporting characters, such as Hudson and Vasquez, have personalities - they're not cookie-cutter fodder for the aliens to pick off one-by-one. I'm not talking about complex characterizations here, but the likability factor (or, in one case, the detestability factor) is way up. It doesn't take long for us to land on Ripley's side and to start cheering her on.\r Ridley Scott developed Alien as a horror film - a \"haunted house in space.\" Cameron's approach is different. Aliens is a fairly straightforward action/adventure picture. The horror elements are still there (most notably in an early dream sequence and during the scene when the marines encounter the cocooned colonists), but their impact is diminished. Nevertheless, even though he changes the tone, Cameron remains faithful to the original (something that cannot be said about the later two installments of the Alien quartet). From plot points to visual cues, it is apparent that Cameron made a careful study of the first film before embarking upon the sequel. The aliens, based on the design by H.R. Giger, possess virtually the same grotesque look (shiny black skin, prehensile tail, row upon row of sharp teeth). The space ships, rendered using \"old fashioned\" special effects (i.e., model work, not computer generated), have the same workmanlike appearance - starfaring behemoths built to be functional, not aesthetically pleasing. In fact, it should be noted that, although the fx work in Aliens may not be state-of-the-art by today's standards, it still holds up reasonably well.\r For James Cameron, who would go on to direct two of the 1990s most memorable motion pictures (the action-packed Terminator 2 and the all-time box office champion, Titanic), The Terminator may have been the movie to put him on the map, but Aliens announced him as a force to be reckoned with. For fans of the Alien series, Aliens represented an unqualified triumph, exceeding the expectations of the most optimistic faithful. (Unfortunately, the lamentable Alien 3 stalled the series' momentum, effectively trashing the emotional core of its predecessor while sending the franchise into a creative free-fall.) When it comes to the logical marriage of action, adventure, and science fiction, few films are as effective or accomplished as Aliens, and there's nothing on the market (either in theaters or on video store shelves) that will leave you as thoroughly exhausted.",

It differs slightly from Alien from the fact that it is more of an action movie in comparison to Alien, which is a suspense, sci-fi horror movie.

This film introduces the Alien Queen, which now gives us a good explanation of how the Alien race came to be and how those dreaded facehuggers were made. I toughly enjoyed the plot and it moves at a faster pace from the previous film; no waiting for something to happen, although it takes a while for Ripley and the marines to find the Alien hideout. James Cameron has written a really good story and I found it really enjoyable to see Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) emerge as a determined, tough heroine, trying to protect Newt and battle against the Alien scum. Ripley forms a bond with this little girl and the final scene is a highlight of this fact, where Ripley has a one on one battle in a mech against the Alien Queen (which is pi**ssed off because Ripley torched all of her precious eggs). This sets the stage for a pretty satisfying climax to what is actually quite a long movie, longer than the first one. The line, \"Get away from her you Bi**h\" that Ripley says when a close up of her is shown while she is in the mech is possibly the best line in this movie; I love the way she raises her voice when she says the word \"Bi**h!\" It's almost like she's saying, \"bring it on\" in a rather more intimidating and threatning way. Ripley was definately scared of going after the Aliens with the marines at the start of the movie but she then learns to confront her own fear. The sets are again, astonishing and expand on the scope from the first Aliens. The special effects are really good; like the Aliens design and the fire effects of the machine guns that the marines use. This movie is just as violent as the first movie and one scene just made me go \"Ugggh\"; the scene when the android, Bishop gets sliced in half by the Alien Queen and this \"Milk\" substance pours out of his nostrils and mouth. James Cameron has made the right choice to make this an action movie rather than a suspense horror film because I couldn't really see what he could have done more with the Alien character in that situation. Although, this action packed take on the Alien series would be abandoned and return to the slow, suspenseful film in the next Alien film, Alien 3. In my opinion, Aliens is a brilliant sci-fi movie and is overall, the best Alien film I enjoyed in the series.",

Aliens is that film, and on top of that it happens to be a sequel. Aliens is absolutely brilliant, its stunning at everything it does. The film follows the unfortunate woman Ellen Ripely  who finds herself confronted by the alien creature again, but this time she's not alone neither are the aliens, \"this time its war\". This film is everything a good sequel should be, it gives the main character new dimensions to work with in character terms. The horror elements are still there but now they are combined with an action/thriller-esk genre vibe as well. This new action element is executed nicely and only helps drive the plot forward. The new characters that are introduced are excellent and believable too. Each character is, for the most part given enough screen time, and depth, so that when they do die you actually care about them. The world that James Cameron creates for this movie is absolutely astounding. Cameron builds on the already rich universe that Ridley Scott created for the first film and capitalizes on it greatly. Each scene in the movie feels necessary and tightly planned out, making each scene interesting and moving the action along quite nicely. If you were only to watch one sci-fi movie in your entire life, Aliens would most certainly be the one.",

I've held on to those words with fondness. They symbolize the undying hunger in audiences for a good ass kicking film. And back in the day, this one kicked ass like no other.\rI had read the script to this film and wondered where those additional atmospheric scenes had gone in that theatrical cut. It was truly satisfying to see that they had been sitting dormant in James Cameron's editing bin, and were now part of this Extended Cut. I won't give away all the goodies to allow you for a better surprise, but let's just say the additions are well placed and definitely help the establishment of plot and character.\rIt is fun to look back at Mr. Avatar and see the early makings of a phenomenal action director. The tough guys with damaged egos. Technology turned on its side. And, of course, the curiosity for alien races quickly becoming a predicament larger than expected.\rFor those of you who haven't seen this film, it's an action extravaganza centered around the Alien universe created by Ridley Scott in the film of the same title. Only this time the fun is not contained to one ugly guy playing hide and sick in a space ship. James Cameron's outing has a high count on casualties and enough opposition to take over a foreign country, or in this case, a small planet.\rWhere this film might benefit from an upgrade is in the special effects department. Which is an interesting comment to make in regards to a Cameron picture, since the guy got his start doing effect shoots. He practically invented the genre. But since my viewing of this film is taking place in 2012 and we have all been bombarded by the likes of Lord of the Rings and the Avengers, the effects clearly show the cracks in the shell.\rNevertheless, I enjoyed the film thoroughly and I would gladly watch it again. In fact, it makes for a perfect marathon if watched together with the first one.\rThis is sadly the last in the Alien series where the production was taking the future of the xenophorms with any seriousness. Yes, David Fincher was a very good call for the third installment, but it was also the moment when the studio decided to put the franchise in the hands of accountants with little regard for filmmaking, and our award winning director never gained the proper production tools to do the franchise any justice... All that being said, I am actually a fan of Fincher's version. It's just hard to follow up a gory gun fest like Aliens with an emotionally driven piece like Alien 3.",

You may watch Aliens independently but miss out many plot elements key to the franchise. With Alien having established the presence of deadly alien in a suspenseful horror manner this sequel satisfies the kick-alien action which was missing (definitely not necessary) in the first film without sacrificing much of the suspenseful storytelling that made Alien special. Another plus point for Aliens is that it has a strong lead performance by Sigourney Weaver and very impressive visuals for 1986. It has the typical James Cameron touch for both screenplay and direction and does complete justice as a sequel. The movie always has edge of seat thriller feeling with the Aliens getting smarter with every advent thus suspense has a strong hold. The final act is full on entertainer but has feel like the protagonists would escape any kind of dangerous numerous times which has a bit hard to digest apart from that Aliens is among the top lists in sci-fi, a justifying sequel which answers few unanswered questions of 1st film and not to be missed even today.",

He did a very nice job blending the scares from the first one with a more actiony premise. This combination of thrills with the action is ultimately the film's largest success, as it makes it a very fun one to watch. It is hard to look away throughout because so much is always going on. The special effects were also, largely, good. There were some sequences that looked beyond fake, but all of the stuff with the aliens was convincing and well done.

AfterThe rare case of a sequel that rivals an excellent predecessor. Even more it changes the formula. While Alien is pure science fiction horror Aliens is more science fiction / action with horror elements. It continues Ellen Ripleys story. After surviving the events of Alien she drifted in space for 57 years until she is found by another ship. After telling her story no one believes her and she is turned into an outcast. However she got the information that on the moon where the eggs were found a colony was established. After the contact with the colony is lost she is recruited for investigation together with a group of space marines. So starts the story. It is intense, has great action, suspense and creates this feeling of distrust and dread that makes this movie remarkable. The menace is so intense that you are lost in the immersion. The great actors / acting increase this effect. Again Sigourney Weaver delivers an awesome performance as Ellen Ripley. Michael Biehn as Dwayne Hicks is equally awesome and became one of the most acclaimed characters in the franchise. Must I even praise Lance Hendriksen as Bishop? He is a great actor and he nailed his role. Special praise also to Carrie Henn as newt. Good child actors are rare and deserve even more praise. If I think about it this movie has a lot of favorite characters of the franchise so I can call it the gold standard all other movies will be compared to. Of cause I must also praise and mention James Cameron as director and writer and Gale Anne Hurd as producer. They tired to make something a bit different than the original while staying also true to it. There are so many cases in changing too much and pissing off fans in movies, videogames or books. Here it works and was acclaimed by fans and critics. Then there are the sets and Alien design. They did again a great job in delivering the mundane of science fiction that looks natural and believable. The Alien design were from H. R. Giger from the first movie except one that was done by James Cameron himself. These effects and care made the difference. Everything looks whole. Overall this is again a cult classic and must see. It cemented the status of the franchise and is one of the rare sequels that rivals the original movie.",

I wont deny that this was a fun action ride, but it doesn't even come close to Ridley Scott's film, and is not part of the franchise in my opinion. I own the Quadrilogy, and have watched these films probably like 50 times in my life time, and its funny how my first impressions of them have changed so much, and how the really good stuff just got better, but the hidden crap under James Cameron's film just started leaking out over time.  Would have given it a higher score as an entertaining action film, but since its the sequel to a fantastic Art film, and it lacks any art on any level it completely fails.",

Y es que después de verla yo diría: \"jamás una secuela fué tan buena\". Yo respeto que 'Alien' es la original. Pero esta me gusta más en casi todo su metraje, e incluso me parece mejor por momentos. Aunque si es cierto que muchas fases de la película bebe de la original. El final de la película es probablemente uno de los tres o cuatro mejores que he visto. El momento Ripley saliendo con el robot para enfrentarse al bicho. Eso es épica.Los personajes son maravillosos, asentandose ya para mi Ripley como uno de mis favoritos del séptimo arte. El resto son sensacionales, los marines, perfectamente explicados y desarrollados cada uno. A mi me encanta Vázquez o el sargento, con su puro, ese puro... La niña no molesta nada, al revés se convierte en un genial recurso narrativo y, por momentos, los tiene más puestos que la mayoría de marines. El guión como suele ocurrir en este tipo de películas, siempre hay algo que no encja del todo o que parece un poco absurdo. Pero en esta película, a excepción de un par de cositas, está bastante bien trabajado, elaborado y pensado. Y visualmente es increible, como están hechos los interiores, los nidos de los Aliens... genial para la época y el escaso presupuesto que le dejaron a Cameron.En conclusión, 'Aliens' me encantó cuando la ví, creo que ha diferencia de la uno que iba más por el camino de la ciencia ficción, esta va más por el de la acción y el toque marine, hace que se diferencie de su predecesora pero mantenga la esencia y siga siendo buenísima.

It is the perfect compliment to Alien (1979). The first film was a claustrophobic suspenseful horror film and this is an intense action film. They are both equally entertaining. The vast majority of the special effects are convincing and realistic, my only gripe is the rear-screen projection as it looks washed-out compared to the foreground. There is so much truly stunning cinematography. Sound design continues the epic memorable trend set by the first film. The most memorable being the pulse rifle sounds. Characters are memorable and interesting except maybe Newt who can get a little annoying but overall that is a minor gripe. There are some truly awesome moments in the story that is perfectly told. The special edition is better than the theatrical version but it is very long! I love the action and evolution of the series. It is exciting and fun. I do usually prefer suspense to action. I loved most of the old-school ambitious effects. More action than horror, not a bad thing, very good action at that.",

Cameron found a way to preserve the spirit of the original while taking it in a new direction and expanding on its characters and universe in what feels like an effortless and wholly inevitable follow up to the original classic - he knew the same old shtick just wouldn't cut it this time around.So instead the film jumps genre - a lot of people regard this as an action movie though I think they're off by one. This is an action-thriller, or an action-suspense movie. The scenes of gun shooting and alien running and jumping is played first as suspense, and then as thriller, wrapped in an ostensible action package. It's more like trying to fight back against the invincible boogeyman than it is just mowing down hordes of faceless baddies.The special effects by Stan Winston are out of this world. Maybe the best mechanical and miniatures of the entire series (it's ironic that the parts that aged the worst are the old CGI). The Queen and her egg laying is just as gnarly as ever. The Alien slowly rising out of the water behind Newt is an all-time iconic shot.Sigourney Weaver is never better than in this film. She's given just a bit more characterization this time around, involving the subtext of mothers and daughters, but it never overtakes the story and most of its emotion is brought through in her performance. There's a shot of her smoking a cigarette near the beginning, with a long untapped piece of ash hanging from it, that says everything just from the way she holds herself. She has to go back and fight, there's nothing left for her in the \"real\" world. She takes what she learned in the original and here becomes an ultimate badass heroine for the ages.This is a prototypical Cameron movie. I'm not sure how he does it but he takes seemingly simple plots and characterizations and makes them fresh, exciting, thrilling, and acceptable to the audience, while honoring the pacing and rhythms without flourishes or indulgence and still manages runtimes in excess of 2 hours. The 2 1/2 hour director's cut here is superior in every way, and it doesn't even feel longer.",

It progresses wonderfully over \"Alien\" as the story is logicaly developed so there`s none of that lets do a sequel stuff. From the moment of Alien ending I wanted to see what happens with Ripley. I have not been dissapointed as this fearsome and very smart woman goes through another xenomorph massacre. The story ofcourse puts her in this situation against her own will, as if the fate played a joke on her. It is clear that the main actress plays the best role, although she is very well accompanied by Hudson, Vasquez, Hicks , Bishop and Burke. The climate of this movies builds up almost 1/3 of it`s time. We know that something bad is going to happen and we await it with fear. This way the story is fairly simple though it still manages to put us on the edge of our seats. We`re never sure whether the next encounter with the black creatures will be the last one, and it`s the same until the end of the film. To add to that, the special effects easily hold on their own after 15 years, especially the alien customes and gore. I have this movie memorised.",

The Tyranids from Warhammer 40k? Aliens. The bugs from Starship Troopers the film (not the book)? Aliens. The Brood from X-Men? Aliens. The Flood from Halo? Aliens. Probably a few others I've missed? Aliens. James Cameron took Ridley Scott's spookhouse in space and completely changed gears to deliver the ultimate scifi war film. Do smartguns on steadycam mounts make a ton of logical sense? Maybe not, but they looked damn cool. So much of what James Cameron designed was incredibly cool and has influenced pop culture. The Pelicans from Halo? Just copies of the Dropship from Aliens. The dropship pilot telling us we're in the pipe five by five? A direct line from Aliens. Angry black sargeant? That's just Apone. Shotgun being good in Doom? Probably Hick's, for close encounters.The greatness of Aliens, apart from its many cool little tidbits, is the pacing. It's relentless. You're on this sorta roller coaster ride, but it's not quite fun. It's tense, scary, completely draining. And when you think you've managed to escape the worst of it... the Queen pops out of the rear landing gear and you're right back in the thick of it, witnessing an epic fight with a goddamn power loader. This film is great because it dialed absolutely everything up to 11. Looking back, it's easy to see that Alien 3 would've been somewhat of a disappointment no matter what they chose to do.

In 1979, Alien terrified audiences and is now hailed - rightly so - as one of the most important sci-fi and horror films of all time. Subsequently, in 1984, James Cameron released his powerful debut The Terminator. (If you discount his true debut, Piranha II. Eek.) While Alien proved how terrifying sci-fi can be, Terminator proved the same - but also how emotional it can be too. Aliens builds on the legacy of both its predecessor, and Cameron's own predecessor. He expertly explores the emotional backstories of the characters that we just weren't given the time to do in Alien. But he doesn't forget what the sci-fi buffs and the horror fans want - plenty of action, plenty of screams and a grand spectacle. Aliens is, quite simply, the best sequel I've ever seen.",

This mainly do to the difference in the directing by James Cameron and Ridly Scott. Cameron fast pace style gives Aliens the horror feel that it needs.

Tautly paced and expertly directed, this roller coaster ride of a motion picture offers a little bit of everything, all wrapped up in a tidy science fiction/actionPerhaps the best single word to describe James Cameron's Aliens is relentless. Tautly paced and expertly directed, this roller coaster ride of a motion picture offers a little bit of everything, all wrapped up in a tidy science fiction/action package. From the point when the opening half-hour of exposition ends and the real movie begins, Cameron barely gives viewers a chance to catch their breaths or ease their grips on their armrests as he plunges his characters from one dire situation to the next. This is one of those rare motion pictures that involves the audience so completely in the story that we're as worn out at the end as our on-screen counterparts.\r From the moment it became apparent that Ridley Scott's 1979 science fiction/horror film, Alien, was going to be a success, Fox began discussing the possibility of a sequel. For many years, the proposed Alien 2 languished on the back burner, lacking both a viable script and a director. Then, in 1984, a little-known filmmaker named James Cameron thundered onto the scene with a no-frills, gripping movie called The Terminator. The film's box office success gave Cameron some clout in Hollywood, allowing him to get a hearing when he pitched his version of an Alien sequel. Fox liked what he proposed and the project was greenlighted. (Consider how things have changed in 15 years - now, sequels are routinely given the go-ahead before there's a script or even an underlying premise.) Seven years after Alien reached screens, its belated, much-anticipated follow-up exploded into movie theaters, leaving patrons breathless and coming back for seconds and re-affirming that it is possible for a sequel to top an original both creatively and financially.\r If Aliens was no more than a series of suspenseful, effectively executed action sequences, it would still be a superior motion picture - Cameron's grasp of what gives an audience a jolt of adrenaline is that masterful. However, the element that elevates Aliens into the sparsely populated stratosphere of great science fiction movies is character identification. We care about what happens to the men and women populating this film. Even the supporting characters, such as Hudson and Vasquez, have personalities - they're not cookie-cutter fodder for the aliens to pick off one-by-one. I'm not talking about complex characterizations here, but the likability factor (or, in one case, the detestability factor) is way up. It doesn't take long for us to land on Ripley's side and to start cheering her on.\r The most touching human relationship in Aliens is the one between Ripley and Newt, with the childless woman caring for the motherless girl. The emotional payoff comes at the very end, and has less to do with the aliens' defeat than with the bond that has developed between these two characters. Many action films lack a heart; the Ripley/Newt element makes Aliens more than just a tightly-paced shoot-'em-up. And, when Newt is kidnapped by the aliens as a potential host for one of the aliens' face-hugger offspring, it raises the stakes by a notch, adding an additional layer of urgency to an already intense climax. Furthermore, Cameron has some more fun by contrasting Ripley's maternal relationship with Newt to that of the Queen alien and her \"children\", all of which Ripley is trying to destroy. The final struggle becomes that of two mothers pitted against one other.\r Two versions of Aliens exist. The first is the theatrical cut, a 137 minute edition that Fox released in movie houses across North America during the summer of 1986. With a running time of 154 minutes, the second is James Cameron's official director's cut, which includes a number of intriguing scenes, including a lengthy sequence on LV-426 detailing events that lead to the colonists' obliteration. Although the additional material is spread throughout the film, the most telling moments occur early (including a key scene indicating how devastated Ripley is about the loss of her daughter), thus not damaging Aliens' overall momentum. Given a choice, the restored director's cut is the preferred version. (In fact, it may now be the only version available on home video, unless you frequent a video store stocking older tapes.)\r For James Cameron, who would go on to direct two of the 1990s most memorable motion pictures (the action-packed Terminator 2 and the all-time box office champion, Titanic), The Terminator may have been the movie to put him on the map, but Aliens announced him as a force to be reckoned with. For fans of the Alien series, Aliens represented an unqualified triumph, exceeding the expectations of the most optimistic faithful. Unfortunately, the lamentable Alien 3 stalled the series' momentum, effectively trashing the emotional core of its predecessor while sending the franchise into a creative free-fall.",

From the very first time i saw on the television as one of those few feature films aired on public television i was captivated by it. The movie is huge and a worthy sequel to the thriller \"Alien.\" How huge is the movie? Even today we still have video games being made based on the movie universe.\rI recommend you watch the Special edition of Aliens that adds around 15 minutes of the movie that helps a bit in establishing the plot and the nuance of the universe. Although the theatrical cut is better in term of pacing.\rThe movie expands from the original Alien and now makes it more about human vs aliens survival story. What would happen if you have horde of aliens against you and not just one. It's incredible. The special effect still holds up because they weren't CG, but they were real life props and they look believable. It isn't perfect though, there are some shots where you notice how dated the special effect looked, but it's minor nitpick.\rNext is the superb casting. Sigourney Weaver is just incredible. That elevator scene, you know what i'm talking about, she's so bad ass against all odd. The rest of the casts are excellent. Henriksen is awesome as Bishop, Paxton character is so funny and quoteable, the Newt girl is also awesome and didn't annoy me as much. Unfortunately, Michael Biehn isn't very noticeable in the movie since Weaver just stole every spotlight in the movie. She's that awesome.\rAll in all, i really like the movie. Growing up i was captivated by it, and now as an adult, i could appreciate the movie more as an iconic film with huge impact to the popular culture,and i'm very thankful to James Cameron for directing this movie.",
