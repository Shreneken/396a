  "title": "Stand by Me",
  "rating": 8.4,
  "release_date": "1986-08-22",
  "summary": "Stand by Me's screenplay by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans is based on Stephen King's novella \"The Body,\" a somewhat autobiographical account of an overnight hike by four Oregon youngsters to seek the body of a boy who had been struck by a train. [New York Times]",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "The entire cast is superb and it so perfectly paced, that the story unfolds with wit, pathos and sensitivity and completely free of emotional shortcuts.",
    "Stand By Me is the summer's great gift, a compassionate, perfectly performed look at the real heart of youth. It stands, sweet and strong, ribald, outrageous and funny, like its heroes themselves--a bit gamy around the edges, perhaps, but pure and fine clear through. It's one of those treasures absolutely not to be missed.",
    "Stand By Me is one of those films that stands up to the test of time. It may never top any critic’s “films of the century” list, like Citizen Kane, or Raging Bull, but it has a charm and depth that seems to resonate with each generation.",
    "The Ben E King theme song and all the imagery of tousled adolescents preening themselves like miniature James Deans rekindle memories of old jeans commercials, but the film is so well-observed and so energetically acted by its young cast that mawkishness is kept at bay.",
    "The richness of its tapestry, densely woven from human emotions and character interaction, ensure it will never lose that relevance.",
    "Rob Reiner’s film is all about the journey, not the destination. And all of his young actors are great — Wheaton as the sensitive narrator, Feldman as the slightly crazy wild card, and especially Phoenix as the tough-yet-tender doomed soul.",
    "Stand By Me is a shuck. It trumpets its sensitivity while reveling in coarseness. And at its climax it suggests that manhood can be found through the barrel of a gun. Maybe this is how Rambo discovered puberty. Maybe real kids should be discouraged from following his example.",
    "Stand by Me is easily one of the best Stephen King adaptations and one of the best coming-of-age stories ever made.",
    "Scripters have written inspired dialog for this quartet of plucky boys at that hard-to-capture age when they’re still young enough to get scared and yet old enough to want to sneak smokes and cuss.",
    "A sentimental film that works because of its unsentimental moments--in particular, its sometimes embarassingly honest portrayal of what interests boys and how they talk about it. Reiner elicits some excellent performances from his young cast (River Phoenix is a standout) and Kiefer Sutherland is memorable as a menacing teen hood.",
    "A film of honorable ambitions severely compromised by a creeping show-biz phoniness.",
    "There's another, more important reason why Stand By Me isn't for kids. Its perspective is that of a knowing adult, which is to say that though the film is frequently affectionate and funny, it contains a drop too much condescension to be entirely successful.",
    "Without his comic underpinnings (there's only a crude pie-eating fantasy as comic security) Reiner seems lost in his own cinematic wilderness—button-down careful, almost afraid to move. His only storytelling strategy involves crosscutting from one talking head to another, and he leaves too many literary ends dangling from the Stephen King novella on which this 1989 film is based.",
    "Some of their horsing around, 1950ish style, is comical, but too much of what they do is only too plainly imposed by the movie makers. Rob Reiner's direction hammers in every obvious element in an obvious script."

I will say I absolutely loved Shawshank Redemption, and despite the fact that it was unfaithful to the book, and badly flawed, I liked It too.Stand By Me, based on the novella by Stephen King, which I admit I haven't read, not only has a wonderfully engaging story, but it is both funny and moving. This is helped by the strong and wholly believable performances from the entire cast that include Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack, Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Conell and River Pheonix especially.The script was very well-crafted, and the film tells brilliantly of the values of friendship and standing together. Other strengths were the beautiful photography and the fine direction from Rob Reiner. But what impressed me most about Stand By Me was not only its nostalgic feel, but despite the hour and a half running time, the characters particularly Chris were so well developed. And I mustn't forget the beautiful song Stand By Me over the end credits.A beautiful, unforgettable film, with a definite 10/10. Bethany Cox.",

Stand By Me is about four friends who set out on what is most likely going to be their last adventure together before reaching junior high and going their separate ways. Of course they don'tGrowing up is tough, but somehow magical as well. Stand By Me is about four friends who set out on what is most likely going to be their last adventure together before reaching junior high and going their separate ways. Of course they don't know this at the time. They're just a bunch of kids who want to see a dead body. The trip there is a doozy though, and in more ways than one. On top of finding themselves in some crazy and even dangerous situations, these youngsters must come face-to-face with some of life's hard truths as well as the first taste of their own mortality. It's some pretty heavy stuff. Especially with the likes of the already world-weary at the age of 12 River Phoenix and the forgotten by his own parents Wil Wheaton leading the way.It's not all gloom and doom though. In fact, Stand By Me much less dreary than the Stephen King novella \"The Body\" that it's based on. There are plenty of comedic moments stemming from the kind of silly, risky hijinks and vulgar banter that could only come from a group of young males. It's got all of the original story's heart, and none of it's occasional mean-spiritedness. What it doesn't have is good child acting. While I'm sure it was fine for the era, unless people are just watching it now through rose-tinted glasses, nobody is really going to view these youngsters as the crème de la crème at that point in time, despite them all growing up to be much more talented. Luckily, their genuine devotion to the material and strong direction from Rob Reiner ensure that none of the emotion is lost.It's the kind of movie that will bring back fond memories of childhood friends and the time you spent with them. You'll be nostalgic for the fun, mystery, and even the heartbreak of youth. An effective drama that will reach the kid in you by getting in touch with the adult who more fully understands the real reasons these kids are struggling with their lives in a way one just can't at that age. It has the power to make you laugh and maybe even cry. In a way Rob Reiner has made it possible to feel like you're going along with the kids onscreen. To me, it's worth putting up with the poor acting and low-budget production in order to experience something like that.8.2/10",

As the premise guidesits beauty and horror..Stand By MeStand By Me is a character driven drama about a group of guys leaving for an adventure without any supervision into the wild nature which changes them through its beauty and horror. As the premise guides you, it is layered and has a metaphorical tone that is depicted through a bunch of teenage kids which is pure masterful storytelling. The chemistry among the characters communicates fluently and the credit goes to the writer who installs these little tactics that can easily resonate with each generation. The structure doesn't divide itself into various acts, it's just a big marvelous adventure of love, laugh and life. The writing is adaptive and strong with humorous sketchy bits that never leaves the bridge of practicality. It follows probably the best structure of the script as in, it starts funny and light and then grows a bit sensitive and sensible with a heartfelt ending that echoes through the audience even after one leaves the screen. The background score may not be up to the mark but the cinematography and editing is purely magical in here. Devouring the nature in each aspects, the camera work is beautiful with stunning visuals and mesmerizing location that helps foliate it. Having said that, it also has a poignancy that can be inedible for the viewers and some boldy essential questions are raised too.The young cast shows some promising skills, if doesn't go as anticipated it certainly works, the performance is in safe hands. Reiner's execution delivers unflinchingly in here and shows tremendous amount of finesse with the help of explicit adaptation. Teenage bonding, stunning visuals and a poetic tone are the high points of the feature. Stand By Me is not one's typical teenager feature, it speaks to all generations and has the potential to walk through decades.",
