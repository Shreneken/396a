  "summary": "A young recruit in Vietnam faces a moral crisis when confronted with the horrors of war and the duality of man.",
  "critic_reviews": [
    "It was Francois Truffaut who said that it's not possible to make an anti-war movie, because all war movies, with their energy and sense of adventure, end up making combat look like fun. If Truffaut had lived to see Platoon, the best film of 1986, he might have wanted to modify his opinion. Here is a movie that regards combat from ground level, from the infantryman's point of view, and it does not make war look like fun.",
    "Possibly the best work of any kind about the Vietnam War since Michael Herr's vigorous and hallucinatory book \"Dispatches.\"",
    "Platoon is a triumph for Oliver Stone, a film in which a visceral approach to violence, which has always set him apart, is balanced by classical symmetries and a kind of elegiac distance. This is not the Vietnam of op-ed writers, rabble-rousers or esthetic visionaries, not Vietnam-as-metaphor or Vietnam-the-way-it-should-have-been. It is a movie about Vietnam as it was, alive with authenticity, seen through the eyes of a master filmmaker who lost his innocence there.",
    "[Stone] succeeds with an immediacy that is frightening. War movies of the past, even the greatest ones, seem like crane shots by comparison; Platoon is at ground zero.",
    "If Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter are like slaps to the face, Platoon is a punch to the gut.",
    "Platoon is filled with one fine performance after another, and one can only wish that every person who saw the cartoonish war fantasy that was Rambo would buy a ticket to Platoon and bear witness to something closer to the truth.",
    "Stone's eye-blistering images possess an awesome power, which sets the senses reeling and leaves the mind disturbed.",
    "PLATOON is a shattering experience. Writer-director Stone, a Vietnam veteran, used his first-hand knowledge to create one of the most realistic war films ever made, one whose success lies in the mass of detail Stone brings to the screen, bombarding the senses with vivid sights and sounds that have the feel of actual experience.",
    "With craft, crackle, a little bombast and plenty of residual rage, he has created a time-capsule movie that explodes like a frag bomb in the consciousness of America, showing how it was back then, over there.",
    "This mercilessly intense movie is definitely not for the faint of heart. The atmosphere remains highly charged from beginning to end. There’s no letup, nary a suggestion of humor to break the tension. The viewer remains as stunned and repelled by the action as the movie’s well-bred narrator, an idealistic young volunteer (played effectively by Charlie Sheen) who naively expects to find himself by sharing the mud with the mostly poor and uneducated grunts.",
    "A touch too heavy on the Faust scenario, this is nevertheless a typically powerful effort from Stone especially strong on the nightmarish aspects of the war, as when a simple misundertsanding instantly becomes a massacre...Gripping stuff",
    "There is plenty of good work to be found here, and pic certainly grabs the viewer by the collar in a way not found everyday in contemporary films.",
    "He makes a good job of it, though the wider aspirations to contemporary relevance seem dubious. Stone seeks large lessons in the experiences of ordinary men in battle, but it isn't clear Vietnam has anything new to offer: war is hell and somebody inevitably gets shafted, but the uniqueness of this conflict lies away from the military arena: in politics, psychology, and history. For all the purported naturalism, the film seems resolutely schematic, and the attitudes shaping the drama are far from open-ended."

Isso é muito importante para a narrativa, pois, junto com ele, vamos descobrindo como as coisas funcionam, e uma subversão de valores quanto aos EUA naquela guerra fica bem clara no segundo ato.Os personagens são ótimos, e o tempo de tela dado a cada um os desenvolve muito bem. Os diálogos são ótimos, e as interpretações estão no mesmo nível. Willem Dafoe é o meu favorito aqui. Charlie Sheen faz um ótimo trabalho e Tom Berenger entrega o que peso que o antagonista precisa.A fotografia é muito boa, principalmente nas cenas de ação, passando a confusão e o terror da zona de guerra. A ost está bem presente no filme e inclui muito nos arco dramático.Audio: English, with original subtitles - Q60T 50' TV Speakers [DTS 5.1]Quality: 1080p SDR [Remastered Bluray]",

Charlie Sheen.A film that has now become synonymous with Barbers haunting score that forms the bedrock for the character study of these group of men we are thrown into awful conditions with fighting an enemy they cannot see or understand. What follows is a 2 hour experience of being dragged from one harsh set piece to the next being seen through the eyes of new recruit Chris played by a very young Charlie Sheen. The journey is shepherded by his 2 surrogate father figures played here excellently by Berenger and Defoe as they attempt to guide these young men from two very much opposing viewpoints.I first saw this when I was exploring war movies at a young age and consider this seminal viewing. This is a piece of work from Oliver Stone that would form the mould for many wartime movies to follow. Often mentioned in the same vein as Apocalypse Now, although two very different movies, both study its characters and look at how war and the atrocities seen can fundamentally change an individual. There are many big players here before they got famous, John C McGinley (from Scrubs fame) steals every scene he is in and Forrest Whitaker and Johnny Depp are also part of the supporting cast. The narrative thread is sometimes a little lacking and the main focus is to study one mans tour in 'Nam largely influenced by the directors own experiences of warfare during his time of service.Platoon is excellent. Its narrative by todays standards is slightly lacking with no real thread carrying things throughout apart from Defoe and Berenger fighting metaphorically for Charlie Sheens soul. As a study of the horrors of war during Vietnam it has rarely been done better and even now rewatching this many years later it is hard not to get choked up any time Barbers classic theme swells throughout the horrific images being displayed. If you are a war film connoisseur who hasn't seen this, you should probably rectify this immediately.",

Writer-Director Oliver Stone captures some raw brutal scenes and attempts in empowering the characters through it, creating a perfect arc for the plot line but fails to ask for attention and offer gripping screenplay to the audience. Charlie Sheen seems a bit unsuitable for his protagonist role and doesn't quite justify its character whilst Willem Dafoe breathes life into the character and is outstanding as a supporting cast. Platoon takes big leaps on its first act and slows down on its second one until which the track becomes predictable on its climatic sequence.",
