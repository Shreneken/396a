    "summary": "When the seaside community of Amity finds itself under attack by a dangerous great white shark, the town\u2019s chief of police (Roy Scheider), a young marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and a grizzled shark hunter (Robert Shaw) embark on a desperate quest to destroy the beast before it strikes again. [Universal Pictures]",
    "critic_reviews": [
        "Importantly, Spielberg instinctively knows exactly when to keep his camera still and allow what's in front of it to take precedence.",
        "Spielberg balances terror on the water with a rich portrait of an island police chief (Roy Scheider) torn between public-safety concerns and a community that thrives on the tourist dollar.",
        "Perhaps the most perfectly constructed horror story in our time.",
        "It is a stunningly effective thriller, as cleverly engineered by director Steven Spielberg (with considerable assist from film editor, Verna Fields) as the mechanical sharks that everyone knows by now play the great white shark.",
        "The terror, panic and small town politics are all brilliantly done but this is also a film about bravery and friendship and the scenes in which the trio bond as they sit out at sea waiting to fight death itself are moving and witty.",
        "The movie version of Jaws is one of the most exciting and satisfying thrillers ever made.",
        "This is a suspense classic that leaves teeth-marks.",
        "Best of all is Steven Spielberg\u2019s direction: the camera moves like a predatory animal, gliding eerily across the surface of the vast Atlantic, creating sequences of almost unbearable suspense.",
        "One of the most effective thrillers ever made.",
        "It was the complete nightmare that invented the \"summer blockbuster\", launched the genius on a global scale and delivered an astonishingly effective thriller built on a very primal level: fear.",
        "Steven Spielberg overcame the lumpy plotting of Peter Benchley's novel to create an efficient, graceful fright machine in Jaws.",
        "The first is the best. When it comes to this kind of thriller, no movie has been able to top Jaws, although many have tried. And, as the years go by, it seems increasingly unlikely that anything will come close.",
        "Robert Shaw [is] absolutely magnificent as a coarse fisherman finally hired to locate the Great White Shark; and Richard Dreyfuss, in another excellent characterization as a likeable young scientist.",
        "Jaws is still terrific and has lost none of its bite.",
        "What sets Jaws apart from most of the other ceiling busters and makes it a special case, like \"The Godfather,\" is that it is quite a good movie. For one thing, it is mercifully free of the padding\u2014cosmic, comic, cultural\u2014that so often mars \"big\" pictures. In that sense, the movie is very like its subject. If the great white shark that terrorizes the beaches of an island summer colony is one of nature's most efficient killing machines, Jaws is an efficient entertainment machine.",
        "If you think about Jaws for more than 45 seconds you will recognize it as nonsense, but it's the sort of nonsense that can be a good deal of fun, if you like to have the wits scared out of you at irregular intervals.",
        "From the outrageously frightening opening--in which a beautiful young woman skinny-dipping in the moonlight is devoured by the unseen shark--to the claustrophobic climax aboard Quint's fishing boat, Spielberg has us in his grip and rarely lets go.",
        "What this movie is about, and where it succeeds best, is the primordial level of fear. The characters, for the most part, and the non-fish elements in the story, are comparatively weak and not believable. [20 June 1975]",
        "While I have no doubt that Jaws will make a bloody fortune for Universal and producers Richard Zanuck and David Brown, it is a coarse-grained and exploitive work which depends on excess for its impact. Ashore it is a bore, awkwardly staged and lumpily written.",
        "Steven Spielberg's mechanical thriller is guaranteed to make you scream on schedule (John Williams's score even has the audience reactions programmed into the melodies), particularly if your tolerance for weak motivation and other minor inconsistencies is high."

            "content": "Jaws is simply one of the greatest motion pictures of all time.

Based on the best-selling novel by Peter Benchley, the film opened to audiences around the world and apart from receiving critical acclaim, grossed hundreds of millions thanks to word of mouth and clever advertising. Three mediocre sequels followed in 1978, 1983 and 1987 but the original from 1975 is THE definitive suspense film. The plot concerns a small New England holiday resort that is being terrorized by a killer great white shark. The corrupt mayor of the town wishes to regard the numerous shark attacks as boating accidents. However, as the bodies mount it becomes clear to police chief Martin Brody that the problem can no longer be ignored. So, with the help of oceanographer Matt Hooper and crusty old fisherman Quint, Brody heads out to sea on a small boat in order to catch and kill the shark once and for all. Once they get on open sea, the film suddenly becomes a straight out action-adventure film, which is a genius move by both Spielberg and the producers, because in the first half of the film, the tension is slowly built up notch by notch so that when the viewer wants the shark dead too, then the characters decide to do the same and the way it gradually makes the transition is brilliant. Also, one cannot review the film without mentioning the iconic musical score by composer John Williams, a frequent choice in nearly all Spielberg's films. The music represents the mindless attack of the shark and it also is accompanied by some traditional swashbuckler music in the less suspenseful moments. The film's other big claim to fame is the fact that it had one of the most troublesome shoots in film history. The three mechanical sharks constructed for the film rarely worked, and when they did it was only for a short while. The reason for having three sharks was so that the filmmakers could exercise their control over the shark. The cast is superb also, with Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss all giving their signature performances. However, the star of the show, as all learned movie buffs know, is really the shark. The film was released on June 20th of 1975 and quickly became the most popular film of all time at that time. It set the record for summer blockbusters since, grossing over 400 million dollars and shooting Spielberg to international fame. Overall, a classic chiller that belongs in every DVD collection. (10/10)",

It exemplifies what minimalism is supposed to do in Horror by hiding its monster and only drawing it out in measured doses. Similarly, the drama is measured and counterweighed with humor, humility and intertwining plot threads like moviemakers can't even do anymore. Complaints about the acting or characters are absurd; several of these stars turn in the performances of their lives.

Jaws is filled with close calls, gruesome deaths and general bloodshed, yet the build-up is everything. He makes us wait for the shark, and only shows us bits of its work to whet our appetite. But just when you think you've seen it all, he shows his hand. The shark is truly a force of nature. Hideous, scary, deadly.\r A suspected shark kill is dismissed as a boating accident. The Mayor, having the city's best interests at heart, persuades the chief of police, Brody, to keep the beaches open for tourists. He reasons that this is their main source of income and they should not endanger that by scaring away the tourists. Even after another death, the townspeople are still adamant in keeping the beaches open. Their livelihood is attached to the sea. The mayor is a delusional man who thinks if he ignores the problem long enough, it will go away on its own. This precipitates in a lot of trouble. The shark's presence is only hinted at for the first hour, in a classic whodunit style. But when it finally arrives on camera, it is overwhelmingly cringing to see it do what it does live.\r A seasoned seaman offers to catch the fish for a price. The minute all illusion flies about the cause of the deaths, a bounty goes up which brings inexperienced seafarers into the fray to claim the prize. They think of it as a sport. Someone catches a shark and everyone thinks this is the one that made the kills. The third main character, Hooper, wants to be sure and advises on cutting open the belly and investigating the items within. When things get way out of control, the mayor relents and agrees to hire Quint to kill the shark. He is accompanied by Brody and Hooper on this voyage, which takes up most of the second half of the film. The three men lure and assault and do everything they can to kill it. This endeavour makes up for plenty of scares and surprises.\r Brody is an outsider. We can see his confusion and helplessness as it slowly dawns upon him the enormity of the task that falls on his shoulders. He does his best to convince everyone to do the sane thing, but runs into a wall every time he tries to close the beaches. Hooper is a college boy with a fancy degree. He is Brody's only support for a long time. For some reason he decides to stick around and help out the chief, probably because he has seen how the rest are taking the issue. Quint is the tough guy with a mysterious past. He's the most experienced in the field of fishing. But he names a price the city has to come up with to catch the monster and remove the taint from the island's reputation, so the tourists continue to pour in and keep the economy flourishing.\r Spielberg doesn't shy from depicting barbarity. The deaths shown are disturbing and bloody, none more than the last one. But where he differs from the typical gory movies is how he handles characterization. We see these people as real men and not archetype characters in service of the story. Spielberg knows the importance of this and that is why he dedicates the majority of the first hour in establishing two of the main characters, and using a portion of the second to develop the third.\r The score was riveting and foreboding. It established the mood fairly well yet was quiet and unobtrusive. The mechanical shark was very convincing. I went to research it immediately after I finished watching because I was sure they used a real shark. They only included real sharks in scenes where it was just minding its own business and just swimming about.\r The film never drags for a second. The first half is a set up but has its own scares and special moments involving the animal and the characters. The second half stole the show and completely transformed the movie. We follow only three characters after the mid point. The characterization was fun and felt genuine. Quint shone out especially in one memorable monologue.\r Spielberg has demonstrated how a summer blockbuster aiming for big bucks should be made. By merging scares and thrills with absorbing characters and narrative, he started a trend which has since been followed every summer after the year the film came out in.",

It's by far the best damn movie I've ever seen. It's arguably one of the most influential movies ever, and a real masterpiece of modern cinema. Plus it's fun to watch all of those people get eaten. You hear the dun dun dun dun music, and see Bruce's fin protruding out of the water, and you're like, \"Oh shi'ite, dude! **** going down son!\" And then the blood fills the water, everyone screams and shouts and lets the piss run out as they're running. And then you've got these three guys, Amity Island Chief of Police, Martin Brody (played by the late Roy Scheider), marine biologist, Matt Hooper (played by the outstanding Dr. Leo Marvin), and finally, hard ass fisherman and WWII vet, Quint (played by a badass). The three set out to save all the little people of Amity, and kill Bruce, the shark. No, his name isn't Jaws, dammit! Anyway, the story is awesome, and the characters are characters you can really connect with! I mean, honestly, who hasn't set out on the high seas to hunt a monster great white before? Plus the actors who portray them really do justice to the characters. And the music is suspenseful as a **** No doubt about that! Such a simple yet ominous soundtrack, one by the incredible John Williams. Anyway, so, the movie is thrilling, is a pioneer in the art of storytelling and character development, and set the standard for modern thrillers! It's no wonder Jaws has been considered one of the best ever! I mean, **** me man, I barely scratched the surface of how awesome this movie is. You'd really have to see it for yourself. So if you haven't watched, go watch it, and if you aren't convinced, go to hell. Because Bruce will be waiting for you there. Also, Saddam Hussein was here.\r*DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN!*",

Steven Spielberg was still only a young movie maverick with a few modest features to his name, but even at this stage in his career he demonstrates such a grasp of effective film language and good storytelling, and showcases just how much influence a certain Master of Suspense had on his directorial style. Roy Schieder is incredibly likable as chief protagonist Brody, a city cop newly moved to an island town with his family, and there is some great tension and class-based conflict between Richard Dreyfuss's wisecracking hippie marine biologist Hooper and Robert Shaw's condescending salty seadog Quint. The trio play beautifully off of each other, and are all engaging and interesting characters who grow as the film's narrative progresses. The \"sinking of the Indianapolis\" scene is one of the very best on film - a brilliantly emotion-fuelled character moment that shifts without warning from macho banter as the characters compare scars to the confrontation of a horrifying ghost from Quint's past. This sequence makes for a refreshing change of pace from the rest of the film, and there are few scenes in modern blockbusters that compare in terms of bringing a real sense of humanity to proceedings - we are really allowed to get under the skin of the three men, making us question every one of our preconceptions about them. One of the great blessings of Jaws was, strangely enough, that the huge mechanical shark dubbed \"Bruce\" by the crew very seldom worked the way it was meant to. Spielberg would have reportedly shown the creature much more if he were able, but it is the fact that we only glimpse the monster for much of the film that makes it so terrifying. That, and the masterful combination of \"shark vision\" POV shots accompanied by John Williams' chilling and iconic theme music. Jaws may have established much of the modern blockbuster formula, but it is far superior to the vast majority of films of that ilk through near-flawless craftsmanship, infinitely quotable dialogue, great performances and a tense, exciting story that delivers at every turn. It works as a character-driven suspense thriller, as a monster movie and at its most basic level, as pure entertainment. It's not only one of Steven Spielberg's best films, but one of the best films of the 1970s, and is deservedly beloved by audiences. Sadly, summer blockbusters will never be this good ever again.",

The first time I watched this movie was when I was still a child by that time I really enjoyed it. Although, I never considered it -not even then- as a horror movie but more as an action, thriller/adventure movie. Lately, I saw Jaws rated as one of the top 10 horror movies. I got confused for I didn't remember it as that good; thus,I decided to rent it to see if I discovered something new. Quite honestly, I ended up disappointed because this time I watched it from a much more mature, less sensationalistic, and more critical perspective. The result? I found it utterly boring! There were very few good moments and the actors' performances were ok, but they were never great. In fact, Jaws was fatalistic, totally unrealistic, and very slow . The first 30 minutes were truly tedious. There was not a story, just a shark moving around, and killing people out of nothing. Oh...! this too! Was the mayor so stupid to believe that hiding the presence of the shark from the press and public  would not affect tourism? Honestly? How ridiculously silly is that??? Even the greediest businessman would have actually done the opposite, for ignoring the danger would have meant his ruin and the ruin of the whole town if someone else got killed!!! But of course such idiotic behaviour can be seen only in bad movies, and we should not forget that Jaws was based in that nonsensical plot.Furthermore, the shark wasn't really horrifying or threatening but it looked pretty fake. Don't misunderstand me...that wouldn't matter much to me if the plot was logical and attractive -but it wasn't- or if the characters were interesting and well developed- but that was not the case either. Sadly, I never felt particularly connected to any of those characters...I never cared about their fate, because there was no depth there; they were almost caricatures of real people!. So, yeah, JAWS is a classic, and perhaps for many, it was a great movie. Personally, I believe its popularity is due to the fact that it was the first big 'horror' blockbuster; however, there are lots of thrillers/horror movies even older than this one that show much better plots, characters, photography, and are also much more original and interesting than this film (e.g The Birds).  Perhaps many of the reasons why people still find it so 'great' is because of the romanticism associated with the idea of the 'classic movies'. We tend to idealize them. Jaws is indeed a classic; nevertheless,  if you think JAWS is the BEST movie ever, then you need to watch more films or pick better ones!..and if you think real sharks behave like the one in JAWS, come to Australia and talk to us, see them yourself and talk to those who know (i.e Marine biologists). Sharks are certainly dangerous, but  they are not JAWS! Overall, Jaws, is mere fantasy...and if the movie was meant to be just that, then it wouldn't be as bad, but it was meant to be a thriller (or horror!); that is precisely why it is so disappointing and so poor! Jaws...an entertaining film? Perhaps... Good? NEVER!...Would I watch it again? No, I will not.",

Unlike the countless shark flicks that have followed, \"Jaws\" doesn't just try to get by on gory kills alone. It's remarkably written with very human characters and an excellent build up in tension.\r Even when the shark isn't onscreen the characters themselves are so amazingly brought to life that I was hung up on every bit of dialog. We may not learn too much about their pasts or anything like that, but we are given just enough information about them to be able to tell what kind of person they are. That's all you really need.\r The climactic battle of man vs. beast is excellent. The movie doesn't shy away from giving you the bloody deaths when you want them. It just doesn't go out of it's way to overindulge in them. As a result the story and events are much more believable.\r I movie's score and even the special effects are still incredible after all these years. Jaws makes a strong argument for why practical effects can be just so much better at times. Of course the talent behind bringing the shark to life are the ones who really deserve the praise. Their work on Jaws is incredible.\r It's a movie that has aged incredibly well. Even after all these years Jaws can still provide thrills that most modern movies just can't. A masterful work that's brilliantly brought to life and still deserving of the highest praise even today, Jaws is simply not to be missed. If you haven't watched it yet, then do so ASAP. It's a classic. If you already have watched it, well you already know how amazing it is, so convincing you to watch it again is probably something I don't even have to do. It's just that good.\r 9.2/10",

It's one in an extremely rareThe classic summer blockbuster that started the 40 year continuing trend not only holds up but is better with every viewing (save that very first time as a young kid in the theatre, nothing could compare).  It's one in an extremely rare pantheon of movies that defy all odds by being better than their best selling novels.  The vision of its new director was a most assured behind the camera presence that I sensed even as a seven year old.  It was a whole new level of movie.\rNow the DCP being shown for its theatrical re-release shows how amazingly that original film photography holds up.  It still looks like a contemporary shot movie in many ways, and the digital surround sound is on the same level.\rThis is an example of pure 100% efficiency movie making with not a second wasted in its Oscar winning editing packed so tight with goods you are amazed how much and rich a story for one feature.  That was the case in 1975 and holds true today.  I feel sorry for those younger generations who think it drags in the second act.  They've been brainwashed by too much of today's insipid pace for pace's sake bloated VFX movies which leave character and nuance in the dust.  The balance of pacing achieved by Jaws was at an all time pinnacle I'd say.\rProbably the most famous music score in cinematic history with maybe only Psycho, Rocky, Star Wars and 007 as contenders, and despite being endlessly used in parodies, it's still absolutely effective.\rThe secret to the monster movie here was casting great actors in a human story that only amplifies the menace of the terrifying beast below in that rare Hollywood scenario (especially these days):  a horror that is entirely possible and real yet never underwhelming.  If Jaws was made today, undoubtedly it would be too over-the-top.  CGI would certainly ruin it and not because of that wonderful technology itself but the misuse and overuse of it.\rEven rarer, it is that once in a generation cinematic event that transcends the silver screen and becomes a cultural milestone and part of our collective consciousness.  Psycho did it with the shower. \u00a0Fatal Attraction did it with the one night stand. \u00a0Jaws did it not just with sharks but with the water itself, and in even deeper and more primal terms with what lies beneath the water - the great unknown.\rEqually simple B grade thriller material elevated by class A big studio machinery which took the project seriously, a man against nature adventure classic for the ages, and a well researched scientific study of sharks and the oceans which became the inspiration for so many marine biologists, conservationists, and documentarians; JAWS is as great as movies ever get.  The old saying, they don't make 'em like they used to never applied more.\rLong Live The Great White!",

The shark\u2019s not working!\u201d That report, piped in through walkie-talkies off the coast of Martha\u2019s Vineyard during the shooting of Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1975 classic Jaws, open The Shark Is Still Working, a feature-length documentary included on the new Blu-ray edition of the film. Among the many trials of this famously cursed production, the failure of the mechanical shark is the most instructive, a \u201chappy accident\u201d that demanded innovation and proved that old-fashioned cinematic trickery\u2014like the use of off-screen space, misdirection, and ominous sound design\u2014was better than any special effect. That\u2019s one of the ironies of Jaws\u2019 success: It heralded the dawn of the blockbuster event, yet its big effect, the terrifying spectacle of a great white shark, had little to do with what makes the movie great. Spielberg could have made the shark work with nothing but a guy in a rubber zipper suit.\r There\u2019s a sequence in Jaws where a couple of locals, looking to claim a hefty reward for catching the shark, hook a piece of raw meat on the end of a long chain, attach it to the end of a dock, and hurl it out into the Atlantic. The shark takes the bait and tears away the end of dock, leaving one of these yahoos in the water, but rather than show the creature, Spielberg simply follows the movement of the dock as it heads out to sea and then suddenly back toward shore. It\u2019s a telling indicator of Spielberg\u2019s aesthetic: Time and again, Jaws finds ways around the obvious and explicit, some simple piece of invention that\u2019s more surprising and arresting than it would have been otherwise. The \u201970s \u201cfilm brat\u201d renaissance introduced a lot of great directors, but Jaws makes an argument for Spielberg as the most intuitively gifted of all of them.\r Working from Peter Benchley\u2019s pulp thriller\u2014Benchley and Carl Gottlieb scripted, though production started with an unfinished draft\u2014Spielberg balances terror on the water with a rich portrait of an island police chief (Roy Scheider) torn between public-safety concerns and a community that thrives on the tourist dollar. After a skinny-dipper becomes the shark\u2019s first victim on the sleepy Atlantic island of Amity, Scheider is advised to write it off as a \u201cboating accident,\u201d but he keeps his eyes on the water and witnesses another death. With town officials pleading for the shark\u2019s capture before the July Fourth weekend, Scheider gets some help from two experts with wildly varied temperaments: Richard Dreyfuss, a college-educated marine biologist, and Robert Shaw, a grizzled seaman who agrees to hunt the shark at a premium.\r The first glimpse of the shark doesn\u2019t happen until over an hour into Jaws, and the trio\u2019s harrowing adventure at sea occupies only the final third, yet the escalating, agonizing tension is present from the start. John Williams\u2019 iconic score does its share of the heavy lifting, but what\u2019s really striking about Jaws is how much Spielberg gets from reaction shots, especially the eyes. Production headaches caused the schedule and the budget to balloon\u201455 days to 159 days and $3.5 million to $9 million, respectively\u2014but its most masterful scene involves Scheider simply sitting on the beach, fretting over every scream and splash, imagining the worst. The worst finally arrives, but it\u2019s resided in our heads well before it happens.",
