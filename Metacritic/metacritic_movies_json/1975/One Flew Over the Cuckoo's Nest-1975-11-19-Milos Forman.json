  "critic_reviews": [
    "Nicholson’s live-wire performance turns what could have been a standard movie malcontent into a martyr.",
    "It’s not just Nicholson’s performance that makes this film a masterpiece; it’s the fact that Forman was able to prevent that performance from capsizing the whole enterprise.",
    "Playing the mental-hospital firebrand who rebels against monstrous Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), Nicholson seduces in an anti-establishment classic with a gut-punch exit.",
    "Too many classic set pieces to mention but keep your ears cocked for that immortal line \"Mmmm, Juicy Fruit.\" Certified brilliance.",
    "Brilliant cinema theatre.",
    "Forman’s classic has not aged one bit. In fact, it’s become more relevant than ever, considering today’s tumultuous climate.",
    "Here is the bruised-plum role that put Jack Nicholson into the biggest of big leagues.",
    "One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest is the best film therapy one can recommend.",
    "With One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Forman takes his rightful place as one of our most creative young directors. His casting is inspired, his sense of milieu is assured, and he could probably wring Academy Award performances from a stone.",
    "The film remains a stunning collective of method acting and 1970s social critique.",
    "Although the picture has not aged as well as some of its contemporaries, its themes remain germane, the story has lost none of its punch, and the performances retain their freshness.",
    "Its honest and forthright depiction of mental illness, combined with Nicholson’s tour-de-force bull in a china shop performance, mean that it has lost none of its power to provoke and entertain in the four decades since its release.",
    "Jarring and electrifying drama.",
    "So good in so many of its parts that there's a temptation to forgive it when it goes wrong. But it does go wrong, insisting on making larger points than its story really should carry, so that at the end, the human qualities of the characters get lost in the significance of it all. And yet there are those moments of brilliance.",
    "This slick and entertaining 1975 film of Ken Kesey's cult novel will inevitably disappoint admirers of director Milos Forman's earlier work.",
    "A comedy that can't quite support its tragic conclusion, which is too schematic to be honestly moving, but it is acted with such a sense of life that one responds to its demonstration of humanity if not to its programmed metaphors.",
    "The supporting cast is flawless, with a special mention owed to Brad Dourif as poor, doomed Billy Bibbit. But the script lacks the woozy, otherworldly subtlety of Kesey’s book, relying instead on pop psychology and finger-pointing: once again, it turns out women are to blame for pretty much everything.",
    "One Flew over the Cuckoo 's Nest is an earnest attempt to make a serious film. But in the end the movie backs away from both the human reality and the cloudy but potent symbolism that Ken Kesey found in the asylum."

One the book was controversial and still is today because of the materials that the film deals with. But is considered a classic as well as the movie. The movie is a classic because the way Nicholson conceived R.P. McMurphy as he was acting. The movie was directed by Milos Forman who in my opinion is a fabulous director. [***SPOILERS***] The absurdity of it all may have been shocking because it was a ward and their were people with mental defeciencies that sometimes would lead to grave violence which is shown in the institution by the fights that take place. But it is understandable that the twist would lead to a friendship that may have been short but showed that way for someone who was trapped. The characters are lovable in every aspect. Chief is the deaf and dumb indian or so we think, Taber is the annoying yet risky nut, Harding or um... you know his nickname is the cautious and self-centered nut and R.P. McMurphy who supposably has nothing wrong with him. The movie started empty and ended up filled, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a classic for every generation and will remain that way.",

      "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThe 1975 movie “One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest” directed by Milos Forman a man named Randall P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is admitted into an asylum in place of finishing his prison sentence. The movie is based off of a book of the same name, and there are a few differences that I believe make the movie subpar. The inaccuracy that bothered me the most was that Chief, who narrates the book, is nothing but a mere side character in the movie. Although I understand that in a movie it was hard to portray Chiefs thoughts as he does not talk, I believe that his unique way of thinking and his narration of the story is exactly what made the book as good as it was. The second inaccuracy was the fishing scene. In the book this is a pre-planned official outing that even has a doctor present for supervision of the boys, but in the movie McMurphy steals a bus full of patients, drives to Candy’s house, and then takes them fishing on a stolen boat. I think the story did not gain anything by changing this scene, and that in the process of trying to make the movie more comical they lost some of the things that made the story as haunting as it was. The cast of the movie also did not meet my expectations. Jack Nicholson portrays McMurphy very well with his personality, but I was expecting somebody that was more sauve and handsome, as McMurphy is described as a sort of player in the book. I also think the choice for Harding was also a mistake, as the book made him seem more sophisticatedly handsome, a man who had a beautiful wife as well, but in the movie he looks like a run down old man. The part of the movie that did not disappoint me, though, was the cinematography. For a film that was shot in 1975 I think they did a good job making sure the movie had smooth transitions, and was comfortable to watch. The lighting also helped set the scene for the movie, and also accurately depicted the darkness and “coldness” of the hospital that is described in the book. Overall I would give this movie 2.5 out of 5 stars, but I highly suggest that you just read the book instead.",

P. McMurphy. In fact, could any other actor do that type of role with the same energy and enigma Nicholson brought to the table? Never. This was a destined role for a great actor like Nicholson. He lives and breathes the character as if he is the essence of the film.And Louise Fletcher? Even though in her entire career, this was the only role she was known for, it is STILL one of the greatest villains in history. Fletcher plays Ratched with no smile, all work, and a sinister need for control. And the supporting cast of mental patients are equally brilliant.This movie has everything an entertaining movie needs: plot, great characters, great dialogue, emotion, comedy, tragedy.

It's notI can't tell whether this movie is either heart-warming of the powerful struggle against a dictatorial ruler, or a sad tale within the harshness of the mental hospital representation of the control built within autocratic societies. It's not like they treat you as human beings, pickled on drugs and manipulated through humiliation.But, the role of this anti-authoritarian rebel, who goes along the name of Randle P. McMurphy and the main protagonist of this inspirational film, is perfectly suited to a gentleman called, and of which became his debut award-winning role, Jack Nicholson. A choice of a lifetime - either that, it would take him years to get noticed, probably. Do you think he would have gained roles in such films as As Good As It Gets, playing an obsessive compulsive with an attitude problem? Something's Gotta Give? Anger Management? He certainly looked like he deserved that Academy Award for best actor, which is quite a stupid statement, because he did.And who wouldn't give to play a role, a role against an autocratic system. Somehow a sad, somehow ferocious battle. The main antagonist, Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, as well as having a name that sounds like a sharp, steel knife, a cold, biting winter, making you think of scratchy, horrible things, it was her calm, yet within, sadistic, demeanour that somehow took a strong grip, on not just the ward full of patients with multi-layered problems, but the audience. The involvement creates a chilling and uncomfortable atmosphere, yet you carry on watching the film because you want to see what happens within this system, being just so engrossed in it to not stop watching it. It's films like these that keep us on our toes and feel for ourselves the control and power that these patients experienced.I cannot predict people's reactions for the ending, although it might be obvious to some. There is always a difference between the book and the film. Chief Bromden, apart from Randle, (or 'Mack', how he is called), is sane, not exactly showing it in the beginning. Seems like a one way ticket to peace and tranquillity, but it is fortunate enough that Randle was lucky to be there with him in the first place. Instead of thinking that the villains have to have their way, it is often an accomplishment within the human spirit, and Randle certainly brought the spirit within the hospital. Winning 5 Academy Awards which including Best Actress (Louise Fletcher) and Best Screenplay, this psychological drama is none more deserving which makes you think more about the society we live in. And for me? A touching poignant idea on the idea of an autocratic society, and the strength of the human spirit.",

The genius if RP McMurphy is the performance of Nicholson, we never quite know if this man is insane, thus ending up at the mental institution, or if his cunning wit but also lazy nature has brought him here.\rBut of course, there is quite the proverbial thorn in the side of our anti-hero, in the form of Nurse Ratched, a calculated and frightening care worker within the walls if the institute who is brought to life in eerily silent fashion by Louise Fletcher, her focused and condescending persona against the live wire and rambling Nicholson is a perfect light and dark or good vs evil-type set-up.\rThe undeniable highlights of the film are interactions McMurphy has with his fellow patients including Cheswick, Martini and of course Chief, the silent giant. From these characters it is clear that the intentions of McMurphy become somewhat unclear, is he around just to mess with their heads or is he trying to help them? But the interactions and confrontations that happen between McMurphy and Nurse Ratchet are uniquely cold, still and disturbing. The purpose unclear, but the entertainment in full swing.\rThe flawed moments lie in the arc of the story. The comedy, while enjoyable, also overlaps with the very serious nature of the film, which can sometimes create a blurred line as to what we should and shouldn't be amused about, but perhaps this was the intention, for reaction and criticism purposes.\rThe performances alone are enough to grant this masterful status, but the blend of sombre techniques and a varied score of heartwarming and heartbreaking demeanour has made it unique in every possible way, from the setting to the situations.\rOne of the most quotable and memorable films you will watch, with its superb characters who go above and beyond in their roles to encapsulate their characters, it truly is a great sense of wonder.",

McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), whose criminal record earned him a season in a labor camp. To escape this verdict, this smart guy decided to pretend to be crazy in order to serve the sentence in a mental hospital. In this new environment, McMurphy show resistance to rigid and austere rules of behavior imposed on patients and zealously fulfilled by the head-nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), causing a number of situations where he seeks, in his own way, returning to colleagues the joy of living.Directed by Milos Forman, a veteran of the seventh art that this film helped to immortalize, this movie has great actors, among which are a remarkable Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicholson, who took here one of the most memorable performances of his career. Sydney Lassick, Brad Dourif and Danny DeVito, in the role of some patients in mental hospital, are also noteworthy. It's a film about freedom and resistance to oppression, a film that teaches us to seek out the good side of things, even in the worst circumstances, and that the worst prison is what we do about ourselves when we give up. The film is full of scenes that range from humorous to the touching but conquers by it's bewildering end, seemingly incomprehensible until we reflect about it and understand the kind of freedom that McMurphy was entitled.Touching, exciting, touching, are adjectives that aren't enough to properly characterize this true work of art, whose beauty was dimly reflected in awards it has received, and which contained the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Drama, Best Actor Drama, Best Actress Drama, Best Actor Debut, Best Director and Best Screenplay and the Oscar's for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Picture.",

What’s moreOscar’s two-times BEST DIRECTOR winners is an elite coterie (newly recruited is Ang Lee earlier this year), Czech-born Milo Forman is another foreigner has accomplished the one-two punch with this film and AMADEUS (1984, 9/10). What’s more impressive, it achieved another grand slam in all 5 major Oscar categories.\r Basically the film is confined inside a mental institution, among a breed of patients, a newcomer McMurphy’s arrival stirs Nurse Ratched’s tyranny, whose strategy of manipulating those deranged is to coerce them into retread their horrible past and force them suffer under the name of group therapy, such a detestable character, Louise Fletcher nailed it, a borderline leading role, Fletcher’s Oscar victory may raise some controversy, but her performance is impeccable in accentuating a devilish incarnation of obstinacy and ruthlessness. Nicholson won his first Oscar in his heyday, as McMurphy, a petty criminal has a sane mind, threatens the authorities as a black sheep in the group, whose devil-may-care boldness and utter naivety (assuming that the institution is a much better place than a prisoners’ reforming farm) conflicts in the process of his freedom-seeking and his direct influence on other real mentally-impaired ward mates, ultimately, his tragedy is a boomerang to his gullibility and self-considered kindness, which squanders his best shot of escape and obliquely preconditions Billy’s final breakdown. The ambivalence of McMurphy’s heroic recklessness is the most intriguing topic of the film, he is not an amiable fellow, a ruffian on the street with a rebellious attitude, it is not in his intention to ameliorate his fellow mates’ condition, his presence does not have an initiative motivation, what he does is his knee-jerking response of a living soul who hankers for an unsubdued environment which the society refuses to proffer.\r There are many political allusions can be extracted from the film, to which I shall not refer  since I am no American and am unfamiliar with the history, but the film garners a great amount of impressive supporting performances, Dourif’s big screen debut is stutteringly poignant, whose demise is a facile move in heightening the tension, but performance-wise, it is more awe-inspiring than the two leads aforementioned. Sampson, as the Chief, symbolizes the hope of the unsuppressed, his backstory is curtailed and his pretense has never been given a chance to be expounded. Two old-hand actors are surprisingly seen in this film when in their youth, a tough Lloyd and a meek DeVito, and many deceased names also, Crothers, Redfield and Lassick, the latter is another show-stealer, over-the-top but strikingly hilarious.\r Forman’s preference over classical music also reflects in the film, the opening score from Jack Nitzsche hums along with a melancholic tone and the symphony-driven pieces are inserted into the right place at the right time. There are many memorable shots, e.g.  Nicholson being electric-shocked and Fletcher being strangled are too authentic to stare, on the whole ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO’S NEST is a sound accusation towards high-handed suppression and dominance, its sociological impact even rises above over the film’s own integrity of a gem made with excellent cast and wry irony.",

I decided to read more into it, and it seems that the central theme was Jack generally being a selfish jerk, who has the realization that most people there are committed by their own free-will, and Jack softens up to help \"free\" them in a way. The relationship between Chief and him is quite amazing, and now that I understand that Jack decided to stay to help the others, it makes me understand and respect the movie a lot more. It was something I missed, but am glad I read some further information on it. The scene where Chief puts Jack out of his misery post-labotomy is as great as him finally escaping and breaking free from his mental concerns. The movie is well-acted and while it took some extra research to understand, that makes it even better. It'll probably grow on me as the days go.",

I've said it before and I'll say it again; Jack Nicholson's Academy Award Winning turn as R.P. McMurphy is one of my all-time favorite film characters, and he ultimately makes this movie that much more entertaining. Everyone else did an incredible job in their respective roles, including Louise Fletcher's Academy Award Winning portrayal of the villainous Nurse Ratched, a young Danny DeVito's depiction of Martini, and a young Christopher Lloyd's illustration of Taber. Now, I know that some people claim that movie bastardizes the book because it's not told from the perspective of another character in the film. However, the movie still effectively presents the themes that are communicated in the novel, and it still makes a meaningful attempt at trying to portray all the events in the novel correctly. \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\" was a movie that was ahead of it's time. If it were released now, in 2011, I wholeheartedly believe that it would be a success - bigger than it was in 1975. It makes you laugh until it hurts you it makes you feel horrible, and it makes you cheer in triumphant glory. Perfection.",

Some suspect that he is fakingThe message here is that life is full of joy and happiness, even in places you won't expect. We experience the asylum through the eyes of McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) as he arrives there and gets into the routine. Some suspect that he is faking his insanity to get out of a jail sentence.\r This debate is never really explored in the movie. He may have been a little unorthodox but surely enough he is sane most of the time, except for the occasional rips in the exterior when we can't really be sure, like when he claims to be able to lift a certain heavy object and use it to make his escape. And he does not seem to be especially concerned about being thrown between people who are clearly more disturbed in their minds. He only loses his cool when he is being repeatedly pestered, which I think most people would. He feels constrained by authority and almost immediately after coming to the facility attempts to meddle with the schedule set in place for the patients. On several occasions he disregards rules and regulations entirely and creates serious trouble for the institution. Occasionally we delve into the lives of some of the other patients and learn about their experiences before they were committed.\r Nicholson delivers a once in a lifetime performance. McMurphy is so full of life that you can't help but be drawn to him. The plot takes you to wherever Mac decides to take us, and it is a ride of wonder. The secondary characters were well realized and quite fun to watch. The interactions between them were the source of much of the humour in the movie.\r Some treatments allegedly used for the benefit of the patients are also highlighted, like Electroconvulsive therapy and Lobotomy. The way the staff keeps control over the patients has the same underlying threat of force or punishment to keep them in line just like in a prison.\r Towards the end, McMurphy sacrifices his own interests to show his friends what life is like on the outside. By embracing the joys of life, he embodies its values more than the ones who claim to be assisting the people in this madhouse.\r I always wondered how people went mad, and why so few came back to sanity. Though it may present a dramatized version of it, it was moving when it came. And the fact that 'normal' people expected 'mad' people to behave in a certain way, and maybe even welcomed it, is perhaps the reason when somewhat disturbed people when admitted into institutions only deteriorate as they conform to the commonly accepted view. Perhaps a bit of understanding and love may be the key to make the disturbed people believe that they are indeed wanted and should make an effort to resolve their unresolved issues, and be more resolute and assertive about their needs.\r This isn't the kind of movie to depend on cinematography and score. It's very simple and straightforward. Sometimes having glitter only ruins the effect, and I'm glad that's not how the movie was made. The focus was on acting, directing and screenplay. When these departments are well looked after, you can have a good decent movie without the need of an especially big budget.\r Not many movies would be able to achieve the same sense of belonging one could feel for with people declared clinically insane, and I feel like it speaks for the strength of the director, Milas Forman, who has a knack for portraying out of the ordinary individuals in situations that are themselves quite extraordinary.",

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a beautifully written/directed piece of cinema with one of greatest ensemble casts you are ever likely to witness. Louise Fletcher, for me, steals the show with her seemingly effortless attempt at playing the twisted, manipulative character that is Nurse Ratched. Her performance is undoubtedly flawless and that's not to mention the lead role of R.P McMurphy, played by the legendary Jack Nicholson who, like the rest of the cast, puts on an almighty show. Arguably, the scene that guaranteed the Oscar win for Best Picture is the scene where Billy is caught by Nurse Ratched in the morning. The use of silence here is impeccable  and really puts us in the centre of the situation with the other patients who loom helplessly in the background watching the drama unfold. It's certainly no surprise that OFOTCN is one of only three films to have ever won the famous \"Oscar Grand slam\", winning Best Lead Actor, Best Lead Actress, Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay.

This film was a rare treat in which I found myself shouting with joy when things went well for characters and screaming and crying with sorrow when it didn't. An outstanding performance from Jack Nicholson, whom I believe to be the best actor to have lived, is accompanied by amazing performances from Sydney Lassick, Christoper Lloyd, Will Sampson, Brad Dourif and Louise Fletcher. This film is relate-able to so many people, as it delves into human nature and kindness between one another; forgetting that the majority of the characters we see suffer from severe mental disabilities.

The film pulls no punches and is often hard to watch, but is so powerful in it’s message that itOne Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest was a social protest film that attacked the social stereotypes and tragic failures of the mental health system. The film pulls no punches and is often hard to watch, but is so powerful in it’s message that it remains a classic film of the 1970’s. One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest is a complex film, about complex people misidentified as simple. Much like other modern protest films One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest applies to one societal problem, but can transcend its subject matter and represent more modern problems, making it truly timeless.\rMany films have approached the community aspect of human life, some attacking it some defending it, this film seems to do both at the same time. The film contains a major paradox, both criticizing those who shun people from society for their differences, while showing that community is part of the human way of life, and that even society’s rejects need community. Most of the shots throughout the film are medium or close ups, which most likely represents what a close group the patients are. It’s both tragic, brilliant, and heartwarming to see how a group of neglected and forgotten people can band together, when society turns its back on them.\rThe most impressive aspect of the film is the treatment of the characters, which is most likely a representation of the time it came out. Many of the characters in this film are connected by the fact that they have mental health issues, and they are rejects, but the characters are all distinctly different characters, and not just stereotypes. The treatment of the characters is impressive in it’s own right, because today critics would probably say that the film is insensitive, it’s humor is occasionally a little crude, but it’s the exact opposite, the characters are treated as normal human beings, which is the most equal way to treat any character in any film.\rThe movie contains a very angry message pointed at the methods of treatment for the mentally ill, and is an extremely powerful, albeit a little hard to watch, because of it. Simply put as the film progresses we see all of these characters, go through the horrific treatment they were subjected to, all the while following one main character, Randle. By the end of the film the main character is a vehicle for the message being sent, as the story takes Randall, a broken man, and breaks him permanently. By the end the audience should realize that they have watched a film, exemplifying the tragedy of the failing system.\rIn conclusion One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest is a powerful, social protest film that uses great characters to send it’s message. Beautifully acted, tragic, and infinitely complex, its message transcends its subject matter and represent a tragedy of the system’s ineptitude. It’s also one of the few movies that can tackle such a tough subject with care, respect, and finesse, it’s just in general a great film.",

There to thwart McMurphy at every turn is Nurse Ratched, whose methods of treatment are so proscribed by rules and regulations that she can't see she's sometimes doing more harm than good.\r The most evident conflict throughout One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is that between Ratched and McMurphy. They are natural antagonists. She's a strait-laced, by the book individual and he's a freespirit and rule breaker who pushes the envelope at every opportunity.

As the narrative accelerates toward its conclusion, McMurphy risks all in a final gambit. When he loses, we know it's over for him. For all that she is the film's villain, Ratched is not inherently malevolent. She's cool and unemotional, but she believes what she is doing is for the betterment of the patients. She's one of those individuals who does bad things while thinking she's doing good. That makes her more complex and interesting than a character who represents evil incarnate.\r The film's ending is unsurprisingly its strongest aspect. McMurphy's fate, presented in such an uncompromising manner, is like a punch to the gut, and the last true act of friendship shown to him by Chief brings a tear to the eye. The final scene is meant to be cathartic, but it doesn't seem that way. Although it's accurate to say that freedom has been attained by both Chief and McMurphy (albeit in different ways), it's hard to see the conclusion as anything but a cloud with a silver lining. For a film that is inspiring and upbeat for most of its running length, this change in tone leaves the viewer disoriented.\r Ken Kesey, who wrote the book upon which the 1963 Broadway play and the subsequent movie were based, was displeased with the screenplay credited to Bo Goldman and Lawrence Hauben (Milos Forman also had a hand in writing it).

This is a standard theme for movies and literature; what's different here is that the establishment wins. After McMurphy, representing the fly in the ointment, wins an occasional engagement, he is ruthlessly crushed. Ratched is victorious, as she must be in a tale like this. Like Terry Gilliam's Brazil, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a cautionary allegory of what happens when too much power is ceded to the government. In the Watergate atmosphere of the Nixon administration, this theme resonated forcefully. 30 years later, with many traits of Nixon's presidency replicated in the George W.

There to thwart McMurphy at every turn is Nurse Ratched, whose methods of treatment are so proscribed by rules and regulations that she can't see she's sometimes doing more harm than good.\r The most evident conflict throughout One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is that between Ratched and McMurphy. They are natural antagonists. She's a strait-laced, by the book individual and he's a freespirit and rule breaker who pushes the envelope at every opportunity. (The reason he's in prison is evidence of that - having sex with a 15-year old.) For much of the film, they probe one another, each winning minor skirmishes. As the narrative accelerates toward its conclusion, McMurphy risks all in a final gambit. When he loses, we know it's over for him. For all that she is the film's villain, Ratched is not inherently malevolent. She's cool and unemotional, but she believes what she is doing is for the betterment of the patients. She's one of those individuals who does bad things while thinking she's doing good. That makes her more complex and interesting than a character who represents evil incarnate.\r On a less concrete level, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is about an issue that was prominent in the 1970s (and has re-asserted itself with some force in the 2000s): the struggle of the individual against the establishment. This is a standard theme for movies and literature; what's different here is that the establishment wins. After McMurphy, representing the fly in the ointment, wins an occasional engagement, he is ruthlessly crushed. Ratched is victorious, as she must be in a tale like this. Like Terry Gilliam's Brazil, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a cautionary allegory of what happens when too much power is ceded to the government. In the Watergate atmosphere of the Nixon administration, this theme resonated forcefully. 30 years later, with many traits of Nixon's presidency replicated in the George W. Bush administration, this aspect of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (unlike that of the state of mental health care) has relevance.\r Ken Kesey, who wrote the book upon which the 1963 Broadway play and the subsequent movie were based, was displeased with the screenplay credited to Bo Goldman and Lawrence Hauben (Milos Forman also had a hand in writing it). He felt it detoured too far from what he had written, and refused to participate in publicizing the finished product. Nevertheless, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest became one of the most celebrated movies of the 1970s, winning the \"Big Five\" Academy Awards (Actor, Actress, Director, Picture, and Screenplay) and being nominated for an additional four. Although the picture has not aged as well as some of its contemporaries, its themes remain germane, the story has lost none of its punch, and the performances retain their freshness. Viewed 30 years after its release, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest remains a very good motion picture, although one that perhaps just misses the pinnacle of greatness where its reputation suggests it resides.",

Only The Shining rivals it, in my opinion. Good job on Jack Nicholson and Scattman Crothers for being in both, by the way. The beauty in its direction, the sometimes beautiful, but sometimes chilling score, and the absolutely mind blowing performances, they all mix together like the spices in a  good meal. It's fantastic. Jack Nicholson plays the raunchy, but somewhat likeable lead with biting wit and later crushing sentimentality. His other inmates, played by the likes of Danny Devito and Christopher Lee, are all fascinating characters in their own right, that you only get to scratch the surface of. And, of course, the oscar winning performance of Louise Fletcher as the chilling, but relatable nurse, who truly believes she is helping the men she keeps captive, is one of the best performances I have ever witnessed. The immense beauty in its finale, the biting relationship between McMurphy and Bramden, the hilarious actions that he does to prove his insanity, his slow decent into madness, the soul crushing emotional climax just before the end, it's too much to comprehend. I can not describe how utterly and truly shocked I was after watching this movie. It is one of the greatest pieces of art ever made, a rare occasion where everything from the casting to the writing was so pitch-perfect it felt as if the stars had aligned just for this masterpiece to exist. If you have not seen this movie, you are missing one of the seventies' greatest films. Watch it if you have ay self respect as a movie watcher.",

The secondary characters of the movie are very, very bad. The ending of the movie is more ridiculous than the opening, but the worst part of the movie is when a friend (Of course, it hardly even reaches the style of friend) kills him at the request of another friend. The stage design is awful. Neither realistic, nor surreal, nor minimal, nor anything, and intentionally made into a ridiculous form. None of the people in the asylum even come close to the style. There is nothing in this movie. Even relationships are artificial.",
