            "content": "On an island off the Scottish coast is a very strange community that Sgt Howie (Edward Woodward) ventures to in search of a missing teenaged girl. On landing he is astonished to find that the crowd of old men has never heard of the girl. His quest will be stranger yet.The island is \"ruled\" by Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee) who is the descendant of a scientist who introduced exotic cultivars of fruits and re-introduced druidic or pagan beliefs. As the island prospered with its exported fruits the paganism became more deep rooted. The Sgt finds more and more mystery as he continues his quest for the girl.Pitting Christianity against early pagan druidic rituals is just one of the intellectual pleasures of this cult film. As the local teacher (Diane Cilento) tells the Sgt, it's easier for a child's mind to understand reincarnation than resurrection. It gets them past all those rotting bodies.Part mystery story, part horror, The Wicker Man blends several genres into one fascinating film. The May Day Festival is a throwback to pagan rites of a thousand years ago (a bit of which continues today in Morris dancing) and are a highlight of this film. The bizarre procession to the sea to offer sacrifices to the sea gods and sun god is historically accurate and sets up a surprise ending not to be forgotten.Woodward is splendid as the pompous officer who clings to his religion. Lee is terrific as the eccentric lord. Cilento is a hoot as the teacher. Britt Ekland is the landlord's daughter Willow and Ingrid Pitt is the librarian. Blending folk and Enya-like music (by Paul Giovanni), director Robin Hardy creates a bawdy pagan world in the midst of the 20th century. The Celtic symbolism (Nuada the Sun God) is beautiful and helps set the tone.A visual treat with great music, this film really gives the viewer something to think about. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "I've been fascinated by 'The Wicker Man' ever since I first saw it on TV in the late 1970s. I was very young then and probably didn't completely understand it, but I knew immediately that it was a very special movie, unlike anything I'd ever seen before. Twenty five years, and literally thousands of movies later, I think even more highly of it, especially now that I'm able to see the cut available on the 30th Anniversary DVD, which is over fifteen minutes longer than the version I already own on video. And, yes, 'The Wicker Man' is still unlike any other movie I've ever seen. I think this is mainly down to the brilliant script by Anthony Shaffer, who also wrote 'Sleuth' and Hitchcock's 'Frenzy'. There hasn't been anything made remotely like it since.  I think it's the greatest British horror movie ever made, but the description \"horror\" only gives you half the story. It's also a thriller, a mystery, a Christian morality tale, and in a weird way, a musical. Christopher Lee regards it as the best movie he's ever been involved with, and describes it as one of the three or four greatest movies ever made in Britain, and I agree with him. Lee is very good in the movie as the enigmatic Lord Summerisle, but Edward Woodward is the real star. Woodward is best know for his TV work, as either 'Callan' or 'The Equalizer', depending what generation you're from, but he's superb as the deeply religious Sgt. Howie. Apparently Peter Cushing was initially suggested for the role, as was Michael York, but I really can't imagine either of then being half as good as Woodward is. The supporting cast are all superb - Diane Cilento as the school teacher, famous mime Lindsay Kemp as the publican, and especially Britt Ekland as the publican's daughter Willow. Ekland's seduction dance scene is the second most famous scene in the movie. She claims her speaking voice was dubbed throughout , director Robin Hardy disputes this, though her singing voice certainly was, and she used a (ahem) butt double. I also get a kick out of Aubrey Morris' graveyard scene. Morris is a great Brit character actor and was also in 'A Clockwork Orange', Hammer's 'Blood From The Mummy's Tomb' and sci fi trash classic 'Lifeforce'. Another Hammer alumni Ingrid Pitt ('The Vampire Lovers', 'Countess Dracula', etc.) is also in the cast as a librarian, but sadly in underused. Still, I'm glad she was involved. Inexplicably some people seem to hate this movie. I can't for the life of me understand why. It's utterly brilliant, utterly unique, and I never tire of watching it. If you've never seen it before I envy you! It's a cliche, but believe me, you have never seen anything like it before!",

            "content": "\u0091The Wicker Man' follows the story of Sgt. Howie (Edward Woodward) who travels to the Scottish island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. However, the entire population of the island, including the girl's own mother (Irene Summers), denies that such a girl ever existed and as the righteous Howie investigates further he learns the terrifying truth of Summerisle. Famed for an exceptional yet short performance from the legendary Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle, \u0091The Wicker Man' is a textbook example of how to create a virtually seamless horror/thriller. Director Robin Hardy at one point thought this low-budget movie would never be made as he was forced to work with a very small budget, a short shooting schedule and a studio on the verge of bankruptcy that was in fact declared bankrupt just a few short months after filming was completed. However, \u0091The Wicker Man' was made and nowadays is accepted as one of the finest horror/thrillers of all-time despite not receiving the praise it so deserved back in the Seventies. \u0091The Wicker Man' was brilliantly written by Anthony Shaffer who chose to add very subtle clues as to what would happen that are made more apparent on further viewings. With the added advantage of obvious research into the pagan rituals \u0091The Wicker Man' sought to portray the movie is left with a chilling feel of realism. An enchanting soundtrack is blended marvellously into \u0091The Wicker Man' which seems to lull the viewer into a false sense of security. Despite the constant foreboding feeling created by the intricate plot and top notch acting, there is a certain playful feeling that is brought about by the elegant soundtrack making it difficult to actually envisage any evil events occuring. One could be forgiven for wondering on a first viewing just where this bizarre little movie is going but the story has a quality about it that can grab the viewer and keep their interest all the way to the bitter and awfully haunting ending. The final scene as the credits roll is an image that is now engrained on my mind with all its emptiness and despair. As the curtain falls on this performance (so to speak) it becomes hard not to question the events leading up to the end and the humanity of these islanders. In some ways \u0091The Wicker Man' is an unsettling history lesson that makes itself seem all too real. Edward Woodward gives a tremendous performance as the increasingly baffled Sgt. Howie. He played his character convincingly and Howie's eventual realisation of what is going on around him is portrayed so well that it adds more realism to the movie. Woodward was able to take a character that may be a figure of loathing in another type of horror movie and make the audience feel empathy towards him. The strong religious beliefs within Howie thoroughly clash with the free-loving pagan society which adds humour and distress at the same time. However, as mentioned before, Christopher Lee somehow stole the show playing the relatively small part of Lord Summerisle. His magnificent onscreen presence seems so powerful that one forgets that he is only in the movie for a short amount of time. Added to this great mix was Britt Ekland as Willow, the beautiful landlord's daughter. Her seductive, nude dance (though a double was apparently used in parts) was one of the most erotic moments in horror and helped to contribute further realism to the movie. The scenes featuring the clashing characters of Howie and Willow are both amusing and tense making for some interesting character interaction. \u0091The Wicker Man' is undoubtedly a cult classic of the horror genre which I recommend to all fans of horror/thrillers. Visually pleasing with some superb acting and direction as well as a fine screenplay. My rating for \u0091The Wicker Man' \u0096 9/10.",

            "review_title": "Brilliantly realized but not for all tastes",
            "content": "Edward Woodward (later star of \"The Equalizer\" TV series) is a devoutly religious police inspector who travels to the small island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. There's a cover up to the girls whereabouts by the entire community and he finds himself equally appalled by their free-living lifestyle...simple pleasures which include drinkin', singin', swingin' sex...and pagan human sacrifice. The title refers to a giant wooden idol necessary for climactic May Day ceremony.THE WICKER MAN opens fairly slowly (and some complain it has too many musical numbers), but after the first pub scene it becomes suspenseful, creepy (without a stitch of violence) and brilliantly atmospheric, creating a seemingly authentic (and unusual) society not dependent on standard moral or religious codes. It's safe to say that the strong and unflinching religious subject matter in this film carries with it the potential to infuriate Christians and Catholics. It's also extremely ironic that this same close-minded worldview is perfectly reflected in the bullheaded lead character, and also helps to seal his fate. Not that the pagans in this film aren't equally unwavering in their beliefs, but the \"power of in numbers\" philosophy rings true here. Imagine a small place in this world NOT adversely affected by standard organized religion and you get the gist of Summerisle.If you want gore, you won't find any here. If you can't go into this film with an open mind, you simply won't appreciate what it has to offer. And if you are looking for a standard horror film you may be disappointed (or you may be like me and be pleasantly surprised). The ending is simultaneously chilling and oddly amusing. Both Woodward and Christopher Lee (with great hair) as Lord Summerisle are excellent in their roles.Much censored over the years, try to avoid any version running under 94 minutes.

            "review_title": "Proof that the British horror genre was once great?",
            "content": "There is a distinct air of menace flowing throughout The Wicker Man, a distinct feeling of unwelcome and unkind put across in the most brilliant of manners because everyone acts so nicely. Then there is the awful feeling you get at certain points when you realise the character of Sergeant Howie (Woodward) is in actual fact a policeman and what might happen if he hadn't been. The Wicker Man is really a mere exercise in suspense on the surface but I think it toys with other, more political ideas during the core of the film before substituting everything and just focussing very briefly on the religious aspects it raises.For Sergeant Howie, he is bordering on the ultimate fish-out-of-water. Howie may be British and may well still be in Britain but that does not exclude him from the fish-out-of-water treatment that other film characters get when they are in that respective situation (see Doyle in 'French Connection II' and Neo in 'The Matrix' among many other examples). Howie is a man of pride; a man with ideas, discipline and rules and regulations he likes to stand by. He is a thorough man and this is partly his downfall since it is this case that is so difficult, it sees him assigned to it. Howie is on a remote Scottish isle investigating a disappearance of a young girl but while remaining within the boundaries of his own world; his own language and even his own country, Howie will find the going difficult and complicated due to several unsuspecting and eerie things.Firstly, the location of the island is important because it obviously resembles a sort of detachment from the mainland or indeed the rest of the world. There is special care taken to tell the audience as well as Howie that the mainland is a good week or so away by boat. So within this isolated utopia for the locals develops a sub-culture, a world in which people are people but methods of teaching, governing and religion are very different. This can be read into as some sort of political statement by the writer of the film \u0096 perhaps he is bringing to attention the level of policing in Britain for the time? There is no suspicion from Howie at all in the film but I noticed very quickly there was no police station nor was there any feeling that rules were apparent. The whole island was governed by a mysterious, never seen man and look at what situation the island locals were in, in terms of mentality.So if this island is a society without law and order; without a stone wall ruling on the most basic humane regulations, is the writer trying to bring to our attention the dangers of lack of authority in our own country? But The Wicker Man is not entirely an ambiguous text revolving around statements on our own world and society. It is a chilling and haunting horror film that predominantly falls into the 'Gothic' typecast due to its minute details on screen. There is a distinct ritualistic tone to the film and it is one that is fetishised. Several years earlier, Christopher Lee himself starred in the highly fetishised 'Dracula'. Here, shots of naked people sitting on grave stones and people having sex in graveyards, maybe to merely gross the 1973 audience out or to just make us aware that this is indeed going to be different, are included and add an ever present layer of disturbance but also one of ambiguity \u0096 why is it that people here do these things? To combine sex with a place of death can be linked with the film's overall theme. The man in the scene around the maypole sings a song about evolution and reproduction and generally about a certain circle of life. From here, it is only obvious that the act of reproduction (sex) to produce new life would take place in a location in which you bury the dead. Life goes on, it seems.Then there is that extra evidence to suggest this is one of the great Gothic horrors. How may of the cast are actually playing themselves? There are the people in the public house and the elderly folk by the harbour. This gives off its own air of disturbance in the sense they might be playing themselves and what with the commentary on society as a whole, the two seem to bind together all the too nicely. Then there is the attention to faces early on. The chocolates in the baker's window have faces on them and the close up of the pub sign has a face on it. There is also the excessive wearing of masks later on as identity is toyed and revealed but generally kept ambiguous. Is this the future of the society circa 1973? Do we know what we believe in terms of religion? And where we are going in the future? What about the schools and the policing? Will this be the sad reality of a nation gone mad if these things are cut back on? I think these are the sorts of questions the writers are raising by making a film like this and it must've been all the more disturbing in 1973.So if The Wicker Man succeeds as a statement then it certainly succeeds as a piece of Gothic horror. It mixes in the uncanny with the surreal and it carries a distinct atmosphere of dread all throughout. There is ambiguity all over the place but I especially liked the attention to the film's music: is it diegetic or not? Sometimes it is and others it isn't but it's such a head-trip of a soundtrack that it's difficult to notice most of the time. This surely one of the better British films ever made.",

            "content": "A police sergeant (Edward Woodward) goes to a remote island near Scotland hearing that a young girl is missing. When he gets there it seems no one has ever heard of her...and most say she never existed. He continues to search and the mystery gets deeper and deeper leading up to a very disturbing conclusion.I saw this during it's theatrical reissue in 1980--it was the cut 88 minute version. I was disappointed. It was advertised as a horror film and the edited version leaves gaping plot holes. I just saw the extended version on the DVD and loved it!For one thing, as I said, it is NOT a horror film. I went in expecting that and didn't get it. It's actually a thriller with strong religious and sexual overtures. There's WAY too much to get into about the religious views in this film, and the sexual element is STRONG! There's a whole circle of nude young women dancing around a fire, and an exceptional sequence in which a very erotic song is sung by a nude Britt Ekland. The mystery itself is fascinating but I really got caught up in the religious and social aspects presented in this film. Credit writer Anthony Shaffer for his script.Also the acting is great on all counts. Woodward deserves credit for playing such an unlikable character--and STILL getting you to sympathize with him! Also Hammer stars Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt (whose part is brutally reduced in the short version) are just great! For one thing it's interesting to see them playing fairly \"normal\" people (instead of vampires) and they give out excellent performances. Lee especially is enjoying himself--he did the film for free! To this day he said it's his best movie--he's right.An excellent, haunting thriller but it might be too much for some people. There's next to no blood or violence, but I do know some people who just found the ending a bit too much to handle. Still, it's a definite must-see.A deserved cult classic.",

Check out the blonde babe Britt Ekland's naked dance against a wall which can still give men palpitations.

            "content": "The bizarre and chilling tale of a fool chosen to be king for a day.The shocking denouement of this film has stayed with me for many years, far longer than scenes or images from more famous films.  A classic of its kind, it deserves the re-release it will probably never get.Superficially a mystery thriller, this intelligent and well researched story delves into the beliefs and rituals of Ancient Britain, its folk mythologies and music, and reveals some of the un-settling fears that lie at their root.  Set on a remote Scottish Island and giving the appearance of being a Whisky Galore, Local Hero type community, there is yet something off-centre about the townspeople that Edward Woodward, as Sergeant Howie, has come to investigate.  The presence of Christopher Lee as the eloquent, commanding Lord of the Isle, gives the film an insidiously creepy edge suggesting a Hammer Horror lurks around the next wee wall.  He is perfect in the role.The story un-folds like a cross between Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby, as the dogged Howie gets led all over town, up one blind alley and down another.  Clues are dropped all the way about what is really going on, but we don't heed them.  Until it's too late.  Too late to walk away.The standard video version runs for 85 minutes, cuts many important scenes and shows others out of sequence.  A BBC version shown in 1998 ran around 95 minutes.  The full version ran 102 minutes but I have never found it.However, whilst uneven in parts and certainly flawed this is one of the most intelligent and interesting stories I have ever seen on film.

            "review_title": "A cult film about cult practices...",
            "content": "The best British horror film ever made? Probably, yes. The best horror film ever made? No. The best occult thriller ever? Quite possibly.The film was in part conceived as a vehicle for Christopher Lee to get away from his Hammer roles and give him a chance to demonstrate that, yes, he could actually act. Perversely, however, the film is in many ways homage to the films produced by the Hammer studio and is at the same time their antithesis.Although Lee's Lord Summerisle was certainly a stronger character than his Hammer caricatures, and was suitably sincere and sinister, it was left to Edward Woodward's bumbling, pious Highland Police Sergeant to carry the film.The rest of the cast are not as strong as the two central characters. Famously, it was always suggested that Britt Ekland's voice was overdubbed for the entire film. Robin Hardy has now denied that, stating that only her singing was dubbed. Even if the other actors' performances fail to match those of Woodward and Lee, somehow, it doesn't detract from the film.Almost as famous as The Wicker Man itself are the stories surrounding the film. The version first released was almost completely butchered from an original, almost grandiose cut of 102 minutes to a more concise 87. Christopher Lee has always maintained that this was a crime against the greatest piece of art with which he had ever been involved. The original negatives were then accidentally thrown out!When a fuller version finally surfaced in 2001, Lee's contentions were (at least in part) proved. The film was overall improved, and save for a couple of points of rather clumsy editing (the flashbacks Edward Woodward has as the penny drops spring to mind) and the pointless scenes before the flight to the island, it ran more smoothly and made more sense.The film's greatest asset comes through in whichever version you actually see. The eerie sinister atmosphere never fails to be conveyed. Somehow, the fictitious Scottish island setting of Summerisle, which could so easily turn twee at any moment steers clear of the territory occupied by Brigadoon or the now happily deceased BBC TV drama 'Monarch of the Glen'.The setting's remoteness, which could have been its worst enemy, is actually its greatest ally.Perhaps the most interesting thing about the film, however, is the way that it steadfastly refuses to fit precisely into any genre. It is all at once a horror, a thriller and even a musical! Unbelievably, these things come together and fit into the film.The music in The Wicker Man is unique, always adding just the right tone of eeriness or bawdiness to proceedings. A strange mix of elements including traditional folk music, it's as innovative and interesting as the soundtracks to Blade Runner, or The Virgin Suicides. The opening title sequence to the tune of Corn Rigs succeeds in transporting you with the plane over the remote coastal peninsulas and out into the Irish Sea towards Summerisle.My only criticism of the film (and I really am nitpicking here) is the way it goes about establishing Sergeant Howie's Christianity. I can't conceive of the Howie character adhering to any religion other than one of the obscure forms of Presbyterian Protestantism practised in parts of the Highlands of Scotland. These scenes contain an apparent reverence for the sacraments that appears more Catholic in nature. This distinction in religious backgrounds is important to understanding Howie's attitudes. Nevertheless, I am truly nitpicking when I make this criticism!But what ultimately makes this film is its ending. Without giving the game away for those who have not yet seen the film, it is inevitable, and yet wholly unexpected when it finally comes.The Wicker Man would be a classic of its genre - if it had a genre. Instead, it has to be ranked as a classic film.",

            "review_title": "Intelligent cult classic - relevant still almost 50 years later",
            "content": "A British cult classic film which uses intelligence, tension and thrills, over a big budget, blood and gore to deliver a haunting vision which leaves something with you.Edward Woodward plays Sergeant Howie, a police man who is sent to a Scottish island village (The Summerisle) to investigate the disappearance of a young girl, Rowan Morrison. Things begin to get strange when the small community deny any knowledge of her; furthermore their own behaviour bemuses Sgt Howie too - some are openly promiscuous, some sing strange songs of life and creation. Although he already suspects it, meeting Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee) confirms that the inhabitants of the island follow Pagan traditions. Howie must try to uphold the law of a Christian country, deep within Pagan territory, which means working against what the inhabitants of the island see as normal, and he, the law, and Christian religion - see as wrong and immoral. A massive twist at the end of the film promises a memorable and haunting conclusion to the film. The picture shows what can be accomplished with a small budget. The stars of the film are undoubtedly Woodward and Lee who carry this film, probably more so Woodward, as Lee doesn't appear for long periods of time. This is Edward Woodward before his famed role as TV's \"Equalizer\". Christopher Lee appears in this after his stint in a lot of Hammer films, proving that he can do something other than out and out horror roles. The supporting cast didn't really deliver brilliant performances, but in the context of a British 1970's film, they didn't look out of place either. As an example, it seems obvious to me that Britt Ekland isn't there for her acting or singing ability - but other assets, which she finely displays! The film looks lovely and bright; it uses a lot of natural colours of nature which helps the theme of the film somewhat. The music in it is beautiful and haunting at the same time - it's just a pity that the dubbing is obvious for the most part. This is not the only thing which is a little out of place, some of the sequences including flashbacks and random dancing/cavorting aren't done that well, some choppy and some with an overuse of cross-fade, but not enough to make you lose track of what's going on. The pace of the film isn't always easy, and certain parts during the beginning and middle can be a little dull, but as a whole it all works - I just keep telling myself, this film is nearly 50 years old. I just put these down to the film being from the 70's and using techniques of the time - and this film does feel pretty much like a film of its time.\nOne thing that isn't necessary just of the time; and something that's interesting and relevant to see almost 50 years after the film was released is the religious messages/stance. A lot of the religious conflict in this seems to be apparent in the world today still: two (or more) sides or beliefs banging heads against each other with neither willing to back down, ultimately with somebody suffering. There isn't a right or wrong, it just depends on which side you sit to justify the actions - and in this instance much like real examples - which side has the biggest number of people. This film does that and through following a more typical western point of view of Christianity into a Pagan world it makes the viewer that little bit more alienated, and that little bit more shocked by the end. This is a great film, not the best horror film you'll see, but absolutely one of the best cult films you'll see. It's actually difficult to put this into a genre, many people would argue is horror but it's not, nor is it a thriller, action or detective film. It's a bit of a lot but nothing in specific - but one thing that is absolutely apparent by the end of it, it's clever, intelligent and it's make you think. While the ending has been spoiled over and over again, go into this film with an open mind and you won't be disappointed. 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "It is somewhat strange that some of the best British films of all time are not very well known outside movie-buff-dom.  The Wicker Man is certainly one of them (another is Get Carter).The Wicker Man is not just technically very well made, with an excellent cast, a glorious cinematography and a gripping script, it goes beyond that. It is one of those rare treats that manage to question your belief system. It lures you into a foreign system of beliefs, it seduces you into sympathising with an act that is - legally speaking - a murder.It is impossible to categorize the film into a genre.  Some have described it as a horror film, which in a strict sense is completely wrong as there are no shock elements here, no gore whatsoever, and just one killing; but in a more relaxed sense this is not such a bad characterisation after all, because the film uses the language of horror films, e.g. permanently hinting at that something mysterious and horrific is going on.  Similarly flawed are characterisations as a fantasy film (nothing supernatural) or sci-fi (no science), but the film takes a little bit each from the flavour of these genres.",

            "content": "Devout Christian copper Sgt. Howie (Edward Woodward) journeys to a remote island community, located off the western coast of Scotland, to investigate the reported disappearance of a twelve year old girl; on finding that the locals follow a pagan religion, and discovering that their precious fruit crops had failed the previous year, Howie begins to suspect that the missing child has been chosen as a human sacrifice to appease the gods and ensure a successful harvest..Unjustly ignored on its original release, The Wicker Man has since been acknowledged as a true classic of horror cinema, a status it most definitely deserves: rarely has a horror film achieved such an all-pervading aura of dread and culminated in a such a thoroughly gripping climax, leaving the viewer feeling so utterly emotionally drained as the end credits roll.Although there is very little in the film that would qualify as 'horror' in the traditional sense (no gore, no cheap scares, no supernatural occurrences), The Wicker Man is undoubtedly a frightening experience, its increasingly unsettling moments of weirdness, which include several oddball song and dance numbers, creating a palpable atmosphere of dread that really gets under the skin. Howie is clearly being led a merry dance, the bizarre pagan rituals and occult happenings witnessed during his stay, coupled with obvious subterfuge on the part of the islanders, all indicating that something terrible is afoot.Precisely what that is only becomes apparent in the film's final few minutes, but rest assured that it is a truly hideous revelation, one that will remain in the mind long after the sun has set on this marvellous piece of macabre cinema.",

            "review_title": "The Sleep of Reason",
            "content": "Although \"The Wicker Man\" is sometimes classified as a horror film, it starts off like a standard police detective drama. Neil Howie, a sergeant with the West Highland Constabulary, arrives on Summerisle, a small Hebridean island, to investigate the case of a young girl named Rowan Morrison who has been reported as missing. To his surprise, however, the local people prove to be unhelpful to him in his search, either evading his questions or deliberately misleading him. An even greater surprise to Howie is the discovery he makes about the religious beliefs of the locals. They have abandoned Christianity and, encouraged by Lord Summerisle, the local laird, adopted a form of paganism. Howie starts to suspect that Rowan may have been murdered as a sacrifice to the island's pagan gods.The film raises some interesting philosophical issues about the nature of religious belief. Howie is a devout Christian, and is shocked by the paganism of the islanders. He is shocked partly by their open attitude to sex which conflicts with his own puritanical views, but mostly by their callousness about human life. Although the film was made in the hippy era of the early seventies, with its growing interest in alternative forms of religion, it is not a celebration of paganism. The faith of the islanders is not a benign nature-worship but rather a cruel, superstitious, mechanistic fertility cult, devoid of any genuine spirituality.The view one takes of the religious issues raised by the film will probably depend upon one's own religious views and also upon how one sees the ambiguous character of Howie. On the one hand he comes across as deeply unsympathetic- narrow-minded, dogmatic and priggish. On the other, he is the only representative we see not only of law and order but also of decency and morality. He may be a prig, but he is also the only character in the film who objects to human sacrifice on moral grounds. It seems to me that two quite different interpretations of the film are possible. On the one hand, it could be seen as a humanist critique of religion. On this reading, Howie's Christianity could be seen as merely a watered-down variety of the islanders' fierce paganism, more socially respectable but no more rational. When Howie challenges him about his beliefs, Lord Summerisle retorts with some sharp comments about the Christian doctrine of the Virgin Birth.On the other hand, it would be possible to see this as a Christian film, an exemplification of Chesterton's dictum that when men cease to believe in God, they will not believe in nothing, they will believe in anything. Summerisle and his followers do not merely reject Christianity, they also reject the entire rationalist tradition of the Enlightenment. They believe that human sacrifice will ensure the success of their harvests and that illnesses can be cured by placing a toad in the sufferer's mouth. Howie stands not only for orthodox theology but also for orthodox science. Religion and science are sometimes portrayed as being in conflict, but it can also be argued that science has had a beneficent effect upon religion; by removing material affairs such as the cure of the sick and the fertility of the soil from the hands of priests and shamans and entrusting them to doctors and agronomists, it has freed contemporary Christianity from these concerns and enabled it to concentrate more on spiritual matters.I normally like films that tackle weighty themes and ask difficult questions without necessarily providing easy answers, so I am disappointed that I did not like \"The Wicker Man\" more. It seems unfortunate that so many versions exist; I have seen two on British television, both different from one another and neither the full director's cut. I will therefore reserve my comments on the direction until I have seen the definitive version, but neither of the versions I have seen flowed easily. The famous ending is genuinely shocking (as Goya said, the sleep of reason produces monsters), but what leads up to it does not always tell the story with any fluency.The acting was too often wooden and lifeless. In the case of Edward Woodward as Howie this was presumably deliberate, as his character is supposed to be a stiff, formal individual who finds it difficult to show emotion, but none of the other characters seemed any more animated. Christopher Lee as Summerisle had too much of the urbane British gentleman about him and not enough of the religious fanatic. The worst contribution came from Britt Ekland, who wandered through the film as though she did not know what she was doing in it. Come to that, I wasn't sure what she was doing, either. A body double was used for her dance scene, her singing voice was dubbed and (according to some accounts) her speaking voice was too, apparently because she could not manage a convincing Scottish accent. She was presumably only hired because the film-makers thought that to have a glamorous international star in the cast-list would be good for the takings at the box-office.Despite these weaknesses, the film is often thought-provoking, and there is enough of interest to make it worth watching. 6/10",

Bryce David and Ray Girvan are totally correct in their views - This film revolves around the plot set-up of someone from a Scottish island sending an anonymous letter to a police station hoping that the policeman who reads it will investigate the case of a missing child - AND WHO WILL BE A VIRGIN ! What`s the chances of that ? and as said how would the islanders know in the first place ?  It also ignores other logical things like won`t Sgt Howie be missed if he`s sacraficed ? and is it fair to assume the police will investigate the contents of an anonymous letter ? It also seems to ignore police procedure . Wouldn`t CID lead the investigation for a missing child , and don`t policemen travel in pairs ? It`s rather a clever idea of a character being killed because they`re a virgin but not if it`s to the detriment of the rest of the story There`s other things that annoyed me . If this is a totally isolated Scottish island untouched by modern society then the inhabitants will be Celts , but are their pagan based ideals truly Celtic ? Doesn`t the English West country have may poles ? If so then surely people from the West country can`t have anything in common with these islanders who have a different cultural background ? The philosophy seen here is more new ageism than Celtic so is there any point of setting it on a remote Scottish island ? It`s also obvious that this has been happening for years . Does that mean they`ve been writing to police stations on the mainland for years and the cops have been sending them virgins ? I can`t escape from this ridiculous premise no matter how hard I try I don`t know if it`s the fault of the production or if channel 4 used a bad print but everything on screen seems very cheap and badly edited as the camera jumps around from scene to scene . The sound editing is very poor but listening to the songs I can`t say I`m complaining and I feel I should point out to anyone thinking of hiring Britt Ekland that if they`re using a stand in can they please use someone who has a vague passing resemblance to her , you know someone with blonde hair might be start . I know Christopher Lee said pre LORD OF THE RINGS that this is the best movie he ever appeared in , but can anyone name me a good film starring Lee where he doesn`t use the words \" Gandalf \" or \" Mordor \" ?THE WICKER MAN gets two out of ten",

            "content": "Drawn to a small Scottish Island by a letter pleading for help in finding a kidnapped girl, Sergeant Neil Howie realises that things are very different from life on the mainland.  He begins to suspect that Rowan's disappearance may be part of a ritual to appease the nature gods worshipped on the island.Well known now as one of the best British horror cult movies (one critic called it `the Citizen Kane of British horror') this film still stands today as new generations discover it's ending and fall in love with that.  Sadly, most people know the ending before they have actually seen the film, which, in my mind, greatly takes away from the film's impact.  For that reason I will make no mention of the ending's detail suffice to say that it works very well and actually raises the rest of the film.The main body of the film sees Howie hunting for the missing girl and finding that things are not as simply as he originally thinks.  The film comes across as a sort of spiritual musical for the most part and doesn't really bring out the tension or suspicions until near the end.  The downside of this is that parts of the film appear slightly dull or meandering.  I did get a little tired with the overuse of naturalist religious images but I accept that they were necessary for the story to be built.The cast are very good.  Lee was happy to do a film that brought him away from the camp Hammer horror mould into which he had been set.  His Lord Summerisle is an image of cold, religious zealotry \u0096 terrifying in his portrayal of evil as part of `the right thing'.  Woodward is also cast against type as he was a harder man in much of his work rather than a pure upright type.  Ekland is good but is dubbed the whole way through the film to give her a Scottish accent in place of her own distinctive Swedish one. Of the cast it is Lee and Woodard who carry the film \u0096 their scenes together work well and they also carry the opposing moral weights of the story.Overall this is a film that has had a reputation built on it's ending, and for that it is well deserved.  However for the majority of the film the pacing is a little off and I felt that the songs slowed the film down too much.  Overall the film works due to it's set-up and payoff, however it's delivery as a total film is not as good as it's reputation would have you believe.",

Now, human sacrifices aside, I think I'd like to live on this film's fictional Summer Isle.  What a groovy place.Oh, and I do like the movie these days.A few crotchety commentators have pointed out some \"plot holes,\" and I think their arguments need debunking.  The cultists were not necessarily counting on Woodward being a virgin; that was a bonus.  Even if he wasn't quite so pure, his status as (a) an adult and (b) a representative of the government would still have made him a good sacrifice, if not ideal.  And I get the feeling that, had Woodward not come through in the end, the cultists really would've burned that girl.But tish and pish to all such concerns, since horror movies are never really supposed to make sense anyway.  The really great thing about this film is its oppressive atmosphere and general freakyness.  I love the wonderful folk music, the passive-aggressive townsfolk, the eerie animal masks, the drawn out sacrifice segment; it's all so ballsy, when you consider that the average movie plays it so much safer by comparison.  And of course, the contrast between the island's idyllic appearance and the sinister goings-on there works really well.This is a cult classic that deserves its status.  You can sneer if you like, but horror really doesn't get much better written than this.",

Give me a bad movie and I'll write for days, but with a brilliant film like The Wicker Man, I'm at a loss for words. If it's possible, I enjoy The Wicker Man more and more with each successive viewing. I notice things each time I see the movie that I never noticed before. It may be something as insignificant as a small piece of set decoration or a look that one character gives another, but they all add to the overall enjoyment I get out of this movie. And regardless of the number of times I've seen The Wicker Man, that final scene has lost none of its power. The images of Sergeant Howie being led off to face his destiny are some of the best I've seen in any movie. It's the kind of moment that you don't easily forget. As I said, it's powerful stuff.I just checked to see who won the Academy Award for Best Actor for 1971. Don't misunderstand because Gene Hackman is good in The French Connection, but there are very few performances that I feel compare with Edward Woodward in The Wicker Man. People in movies like The Wicker Man don't generally get recognized for awards, but they should. It's a fantastic performance. Every moment, whether it's what I call The Seduction of Sgt. Howie to The Indignation of Sgt. Howie to The Martyrdom of Sgt. Howie, Woodward expresses more emotion and conveys more feeling than most actors are capable of. Whether you like the character or not, it would be difficult to deny how effective Woodward is.",

            "review_title": "A towering classic of the British horror scene",
            "content": "One of the quintessential British horror movies of the 1970s, as reckoned in the many books to come out on the subject in recent years (Ten Years of Terror is recommended reading to any fan of the genre), THE WICKER MAN is a truly unique film which succeeds in being a true horror film. Yet there are no vampires or monsters here, no bloodshed, violence, or gore. Instead, the film starts off deceptively slowly, taking care to characterise Woodward's central figure and paint a complex picture of the community of Summerisle into which he comes. Then the clues begin to fall together, the suspense builds up rapidly and POW!, the film hits you with one of the most stunning climaxes ever seen in a horror film.For the most part, this doesn't even feel like a horror film, just a study of a community of pagans and heathens. Upstanding Christian Howie is of course shocked by all the so-called depravity he sees around him (couples copulating in fields at night; young girls dancing naked through fires; reproduction and reincarnation taught at the local school) and tries desperately to uphold his moral values when temptress Britt Ekland dances naked into the room next to his at night. The movie is beautifully shot, as seen in the opening shots of Howie's plane flying into the island; and the visuals are accompanied by plentiful folky music which helps to transfer the spirit of the islanders across, with many of the tunes being catchy and playful, not to mention melodic. When I learnt that THE WICKER MAN was actually filmed in 26-or-so separate locations I was shocked, because I was completely convinced that the community of Summerisle really did exist at first.What makes this film - and, in particular, the finale - so effective is its basis in reality. There are no showy or shouty performances, just matter-of-fact people going about their lives. No special effects or anything like that. Only vague hints of the darker things to come later in the movie - talk of crop failure and ritual sacrifice; the Hand of Glory appearing on Woodward's bedside; the whole story of the missing girl and the hare in her coffin. Towards the end, the film becomes a suspenseful actioner for a while as Woodward infiltrates the May Day celebrations in disguise and attempts to rescue the kidnapped girl, but then the twist ending arrives and turns everything around that you've previously seen, much like in THE SIXTH SENSE and no less effective.The finale is classic stuff and the image of the burning wicker man one of the most enduring in horror cinema. The moment in which Woodward first sees the figure and says \"oh, Jesus, no!\" still has the power to send a shiver down my spine although I've seen the movie half a dozen times. The shots of Woodward reciting the Lord's Prayer as the pigs squeal and burn is almost impossibly powerful and quite stunning - I've never seen anything like it. Forget CHILDREN OF THE CORN, THE WICKER MAN really is the last word on pagan worship and the theme has never been bettered.Edward Woodward puts in the performance of his career as the increasingly desperate Howie; a flawed and often laughable man, but still one you can identify with and sympathise with, and that's the key. Screen legend Christopher Lee enjoys what was his personally favourite performance as Lord Summerisle, and makes his character's convictions scarily convincing - a chilling turn, despite the fact that he is kind and courtly, or happy and laughing, for the majority of his appearance! Genre regulars Britt Ekland and Ingrid Pitt once again shed their inhibitions for the sake of their art to good effect, and each and every creepy islander is effective in his or her role, giving the film a truly scary conspiracy-style feel when the secrets are at last unearthed. Always watchable and truly enduring, THE WICKER MAN has achieved the interest it always deserved in recent years, with the final cut finally being released on Blu-ray format. This really is one of the best horror films to come out of the British Isles and maybe one of the best in screen cinema.",

            "content": "Hammer Films may be synonymous with British horror, but they don't have a total monopoly on the genre in the isles - as demonstrated by, for example, Tigon's 1971 classic 'The blood on Satan's claw.' 'The wicker man' may even still be the most famous example, and not only is it not a Hammer production, but it's a far cry from any other such title that readily comes to mind. It's one matter to note the prominent folk elements that define the narrative; it's another to observe the substantial, prevalent role of music as it flavors many scenes. Even the fundamental thrust of the narrative are well removed from the usual horror fare, as our protagonist is a stodgy, conservative, unlikable police officer and Christian zealot, while the people he is investigating are happy, fruitful, and productive, and by the standards of 2022 appear far more enlightened by comparison. This is hardly to say that one should unremittingly condone every last activity of the Summerisle community, yet by and large the genre element is much more about what the viewer reads into the picture with their own presuppositions, as opposed to what is outwardly shown to us: not the blood, gore, violence, or monsters that any film may bear, but our cultural biases. The horror of this feature is the absence of horror.'The wicker man' is truly, unquestionably brilliant, classic, and essential. One recognizes very well how this one movie not only raised the bar for horror when it was released, and rather upended the genre, but also how it has influenced and inspired storytelling within these spaces in all the years since. And even at that, one iteration is clearly distinct from another - not just because this was arguably the point of origin, but because each provides its own twists to set it apart. The horrid protagonist and the fetching music are absolutely aspects that make 'The wicker man' so unique, but they're not alone, for the marvelous genius of the costume design, production design, and art direction dressing up the lovely filming locations could never be mistaken for anything else. Where it shows up outside select folk songs, Paul Giovanni's original score is just as delicious - and, why, look at that cast! Christopher Lee, Ingrid Pitt, Britt Ekland, and more!One can practically feel the full, loving passion and care of Robin Hardy's direction; every scene to play out, especially within the last act, carries the undeniable warmth and meticulousness of only the greatest and most meticulous film-making craft. And Anthony Shaffer's screenplay is just as exquisite, a dazzling spectacle that towers over many, many of all its predecessors, contemporaries, and successors of genre fare. Usually when we watch a movie and find ourselves cheering for the villain it's because the title is so poorly made, or its characters so dull. Here, it's not just because the protagonist is so thoroughly unsympathetic, but also because the Summerisle community specifically is so friendly and inviting, and almost (key word: almost) everything they do is not at all out of the ordinary, let alone worrisome. From characters and dialogue to scene writing and the story at large, Shaffer crafted an unforgettable tale that stirs together fiction with just enough realist flourishes to stand the test of time forevermore.It's hard to speak at especial length about this picture without betraying foreknowledge for those who haven't yet enjoyed it. All I can say is that whatever expectations one may have of genre storytelling, even the very highest, I firmly believe this will continue to meet or exceed them. For every superb horror film that has ever been made, very few can meaningfully compare: 'The wicker man' is a must-see for one and all, and that's all there is to it.",

Soon he realizes that cheerful and smiling residents of the island, adults and children led by their spiritual leader Lord Summersisle (Christopher Lee) are engaged in the pagan religion with the rituals that shock and disgust devoted Christian Howie.

I automatically gravitate towards movies with such stories and it's one of the reasons why I watched THE WICKER MAN. Unfortunately, the script is filled with so many plot-holes that I simply couldn't get into it. Of all the many plot-holes, the biggest and the least forgiving one has to do with the police officer and the anonymous letter. You'd think that the character played by Woodward would have WONDERED for one second about who sent the letter and what's the purpose of the letter. But from the get go, the script assumes that the police officer believes the letter is 100% authentic, even after he's being played around here and there on the island by its inhabitants as he's doing his investigation. At one time, Woodward even decides that the girl is not dead but alive and yet he still doesn't question the authenticity or even the reason behind the anonymous letter that got him there in the first place. I mean, come on! After deciding Rowan was still alive and after being played like a puppet, Woodward should have at least questioned the merit of the letter. He should have then tried to find the person responsible for the letter and ask that person the questions that needed to be answered, etc. But no. The letter is just a plot device.Had the script actually dealt with this *massive* and important detail in a right way, I think I would have sorta accepted the film as is but because this deliberate oversight from screenwriter Anthony Shaffer, I just didn't like THE WICKER MAN. To add more goofiness to the whole silly script, Edward Woodward, who overacts shamelessly, comes across as some sort of Dudley Do Wrong. He's so dense and overlooks all the obvious clues that he just looks stupid (the massive plot-hole I've already mentioned doesn't help him much too), and in the end, whatever happens to him, well, he deserves it thoroughly. Because of this, the movie's much vaunted climax is entirely devoid of any shocking, tragic or emotional resonance. Had the police officer actually been written as someone with some sort of intelligence and had the script actually dealt with all the important details it tried to set-up, then the ending would have been amazing.There are other silly plot-holes, like how the folks on the island will explain the police officer's disappearance to the people on the mainland. Or do the extremely isolated people of the island usually send letters to the mainland? Or why is everyone singing? With everyone singing, including a naked Britt Ekland, the movie ends up looking like a musical of sorts. Unfortunately, the kind of music the film has reminded me of the songs in MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL and every time someone started singing, I couldn't help but laugh out loud. Anyway, the idea behind THE WICKER MAN is actually great but the execution is seriously faulty on so many levels that the really cool idea within the story is completely nullified. THE WICKER MAN doesn't work at all.",

When he arrives on the island, the folks seem to have no idea about who the girl is, but through his investigation he realises that they are keeping him in the dark about it. While, at the same time his Christian beliefs are tested as the community led by Lord Summerisle openly perform their Pagan ways, despite that of Howie's personal disgust.It's been quite awhile since I've last watched this flick, but none of that impending doom and confronting material I felt on my first viewing has escape this timeless masterpiece. The way the old-fashioned tale is able to captivate with it's vividly, intelligent labyrinth of believable developments and symbolisms makes it hard not to get emotionally attached. Well, that was the case for me. \"The Wicker Man\" was a different type of horror (which has never been matched in its context) compared to the most practical Hammer vehicles that were coming out of England at the time and actor Christopher Lee knew it. The version I got around to watching was the extended director's cut and I didn't really know that it had a bumpy, that's a REAL bumpy production history. The interviews on the DVD on the matter is pretty interesting and very informative. It was nice to see it in its full cut, as think I caught the original theatrical release when it was played on TV.This fascinating film is something you won't see quite often with it's very expressive and soothing folk musical elements that burns itself a mark in the haunting atmosphere. While, the seductiveness of these sensual activities and rituals of the old religion gives the film an powerful embrace where you're just so compelled to the presentation. While, it might look rather relaxing and carefree in appearance, there was just something unsettling underneath it all waiting to break out. And the sting in the film's tale proves that. The film is probably best known for it's shocking conclusion and I still get goose bumps and a lump in my throat when watching it.The credible story by Anthony Shaffer stirs the emotions by balancing out some complex and poetic details, but it's so well rounded on many levels that the intensity thickens with the continuous debate between the two religions - Christianity and Paganism. Also there's some moral ground being thrown about and script too is rather diverse. But let's not forget the central focus is that of the missing girl that adds to the mystery side of the story. This segment of the story is incredibly gripping and has a realistically nightmarish touch in the way it pans out. The film's art direction is beautifully captured with it's mesmerizing glow and the picturesque location provided some breath-taking scenery.The performances are nothing but short of fabulous with a strong show by the entire cast. Their characters were rather fruitful and they took advantage of that. Edward Woodward is downright brilliant as the hard-nosed Police Sergeant Howie who represents Christianity and the law. He simply evokes such a strict passion in his delivery! Christopher Lee is at the top of his game as the mysterious Lord Summerisle. Gladly none of them chew up the scenery. The rest of the supporting roles were great too. Britt Ekland is extremely divine as the very tempting Willow, Diane Cilento is equally so as the schoolteacher Miss Rose. Also making a very small appearance is Ingrid Pitt.Vintage work all round makes this one an effectively clever and graceful, but also quite unsettling film.Side-note: But even with all of this praise that I have given to it, I see that mostly people tend love it or hate it.",

I don't think it is quite a classic, there are parts that do move slowly and others that feel somewhat stilted. Regardless, it is still extremely good, with a brilliant script and impressive locations and cinematography. The story is also very effective, and the ending is another great strength, being quite shocking. That is the thing about the Wicker Man, it is bizarre and it is disturbing but that works in the film's favour in alternative to against it. The acting is very well done, as is Robin Hardy's direction. Edward Woodward does a good job as the prudish Sergeant Howie and Britt Ekland is beautifully seductive as the pub landlord's free spirited daughter. But in my opinion, it is the magnificent Christopher Lee who walks away with the film as the mysterious Lord Summerisle. Overall, while not quite a classic, it is still a very effective psycho-sexual horror-thriller, that was bastardised by a completely unnecessary remake with Nicolas Cage. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

Howie encounters a peculiar, yet seemingly peaceful pagan cult led by the charismatic Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee at his most personable and persuasive). However, said cult may not be nearly as benign as they outwardly appear to be.Director Robin Hardy relates the absorbing story at a steady pace, handles the strong and provocative subject matter about radically opposing religious principles and perspectives with care and intelligence, astutely pegs a happy and charming quality that slowly, but surely becomes more increasingly grim and upsetting as the narrative progresses towards a shocking downbeat conclusion, and tops everything off with a wickedly playful sense of merry perverse humor.Anthony Shaffer's sharp and literate script brilliantly subverts the old standard cornball notion about the enduring strength of faith: Howie's staunch adherence to his deeply felt Christian beliefs enables him to die instead of giving him the ability to survive and live to see another day. Another ingenious and inspired touch is that horrible and disturbing things happen in the bright daylight rather than at night like in more generic horror fare. Moreover, this film further benefits from fine acting by Diane Cilento as sweet school teacher Miss Rose, Britt Ekland as the enticing Willow, Ingrid Pitt as a foxy librarian, Lindsey Kemp as easygoing innkeeper Alder MacGregor, Aubrey Morris as a creepy gravedigger, and Ian Campbell as hulking brute Oak.

            "content": "Great ideas to be found in The Wicker Man, but, man, is it poorly executed! It's barely competent in its direction, editing, and writing. Of course, the version I watched is apparently much shorter than the latest director's cut. Still, I can't imagine it being any longer - Christ, how could it be any longer? 90% of the film's faults can be found in the main character, Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward). He is a police officer who goes to remote Summerisle to investigate a reported missing child case. The island is populated by pagan worshipers, and he is a Christian. While the inhabitants dance around the isle naked, he prays, sweats, and assumes that they are going to or have already sacrificed the missing child to their heathen gods. Howie is a terrible character, very poorly performed by Woodward. He's constantly shifting and changing, going through ridiculous jumps in logic. To boot, he's entirely unsympathetic - one of the cinema's greatest douche bags. Basically, I was sitting there just wishing someone would sacrifice his ass. All the other performances are rather pretty amateurish, as well. Christopher Lee's is the only one really approaching competence, although there were some stretches when I couldn't exactly understand what he was saying. I guess Britt Ekland was okay, who plays the innkeeper's daughter, but I was probably just hypnotized by her gyrating bare bum. The writing is often laughable. Even though I watched a shortened version of the film, there were still too many scenes that were obviously and unarguably redundant. I'm specifically thinking of a scene in which Sergeant Howie goes to the library and reads a book that gives him the final clues he needs to realize where the missing girl is - except that he already figured it all out the night before in his hotel room. The screenwriter really should have been paying more attention - or any attention at all. There are a couple of big reasons that do make the film marginally decent. I mean, even while I did feel it was a pretty silly film, and I could go on criticizing it for pages, I did actually find a lot to like. In particular, the music is great. It can be thought of as a musical, as there are several musical sequences - and very good ones - in the film. And it does have an amazing, memorable final sequence. All in all, it's worth a watch. I just don't think it's worth going nuts over, as many seem to have. 6/10.",

Howie realizes that the locals are pagans, practicing old rituals, and Rowan is probably alive and being prepared to be sacrificed. The end of the story is a tragic surprise. This movie is a different horror movie in all aspects: first, the environment, with beautiful and happy people, naked women, full of sunshine, love scenes and songs, contrasting with those dark and Gothic movies, with monsters or weird persons, taking place in the night, in shadowy castles or forests. The simple and original story, which has a surprising end, hooks the attention until the last scene. The cast, mainly Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee, has a great performance, especially in the duel of their religious beliefs.

What he finds is a culture steeped in Paganism, presided over by Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee). Meeting static and indifference wherever he goes - and being driven to anger by the assault on his Christian beliefs - Howie is very much a man alone and most likely in grave danger? Directed by Robin Hardy and adapted to screen by Anthony Shaffer from David Pinner's novel, Ritual, The Wicker Man is very much a cult masterpiece. The back stories to it could make a film all by itself, be it censor baiting, studio cuts, body doubles or just plain offending religious groups, it's a film that is well worth looking into via the top range home format releases.From the moment Howie (a truly brilliant Woodward) lands at Summerisle everything seems off, there's a sinister atmosphere pervading the story. He is met by unnerving imagery wherever he goes, songs and rituals gnawing away at his senses, there's even eroticism deftly placed within the film's master plan. He doesn't know what's going on, and neither do we, this is a mystery right? There is after all a missing child to be found, right? But once Lord Summerisle (Lee also terrific) enters proceedings and ups his game, things unravel in edgy fashion, building up to the justifiably famous and harrowing finale.Some modern horror fans may baulk at the lack of bloody carnage et al, but this is classic horror.

            "content": "Ever since its troubled release back in 1973, director Robin Hardy's \"The Wicker Man\" has been slowly (but constantly) adding new members to its cult following as the film becomes better known, and it's just now that finally the movie is getting the praise it deserves as one of the best films (regardless of genre) ever made. It's hard to believe that this superb example of a mystery and suspense was almost lost, as the financial problems of its production company (British Lion Films) nearly cost Hardy his movie. Fortunately, the film managed to be finished, and while not exactly in the complete version of the director's vision, \"The Wicker Man\" was released theatrically and Hardy's tale of the horrific results of a clash of faiths was able to enchant us with its perfect mix of horror, mystery and suspense.In \"The Wicker Man\", Edward Woodward plays Sergeant Neil Howie, who travels to the remote island of Summerisle after receiving an anonymous letter informing him of the disappearance of a young girl named Rowan. Immediately after his arrival to Summerisle, Howie begins his investigation, but discovers that the locals refuse having met Rowan in the island. Somewhat discouraged by the answers, Howie decides to keep investigating, and soon discovers that the population of the island follow a strange religion with pagan beliefs that are a shock for his conservative Christian faith. As he discovers that Rowan may still be alive (and the villagers plotting her kidnapping), he decides to attempt to rescue her from what he thinks is a barbaric and uncivilized way of life, but he'll discover that there is much more in Summerisle than the case of a kidnapped child.Writer Anthony Shaffer became fascinated by the idea of a modern clash of religions when he attempted to adapt David Pinner's novel \"Ritual\" to film, but while the adaptation failed, the idea became the source for \"The Wicker Man\"'s main theme: a confrontation between two extreme sides of religiousness. It's really amazing the way that Shaffer explores this theme through the story, because cleverly avoids to use the archetypes of \"hero\" and \"villian\", and just lets the characters drive the plot towards it's legendary finale. While he cleverly utilizes the missing child plot to question the nature of faith, it's surprisingly never disrespectful, and despite using exaggerated features of both in his characters, the movie is more a cry against blind fanaticism than against a specific religion.Even when Shaffer's brilliant screenplay is one of the film's fundamental elements, the direction by Robin Hardy is what truly makes the whole movie what it is. Despite being under a serious budgetary problem, Hardy managed to bring to life Shaffer's thriller taking advantage of the script's exhaustively researched plot to create a movie that was ambiguously captivating and of a simply otherworldly nature. By blending a natural, semi-documentary visual look with the unforgettable folk score by Paul Giovanni (that updated old traditional songs), Hardy created a joyful atmosphere that despite being cheerful and playful at first sight, becomes increasingly haunting as the plot unfolds. Giving little to no clue about the mystery of the plot, Hardy maintains the suspense always at the maximum level in preparation to a sublime conclusion that has now become a classic.Another of the film's best features are the incredible performance of the members of the cast. Edward Woodward is simply perfect in the difficult role of Sergeant Howie, delivering one of the best performances in the history of the horror genre as the main character of this brutal clash of cultures. The legendary Christopher Lee plays Lord Summerisle, owner and ruler of the island, and one of the movie's most interesting characters. Lee literally becomes Summerisle and fills the role with his natural charm and breathtaking talent. Director Hardy managed to convince Diane Cilento to come out of retirement and play a part in \"The Wicker Man\", adding her experience to the film's assortment of talents. Finally, Britt Ekland plays Willow, a local of Summersile who gets interested in the newly arrived cop. Ekland may not give a performance as amazing as her three co-stars, but she gives the eroticism the movie needs in an unforgettable scene.Sadly, the first thing one notices about \"The Wicker Man\" is how date it looks. While the themes at play are really universal, the movie can't help but look like a product of its time, specifically Great Britain in the 70s. True, this can be a flaw in a way, however, thanks to the style Hardy took on the making of the film (like truly exploring a different culture) make up for this flaw and now give the film the look of a real documentary film (and this of course increases its gritty realism). \"The Wicker Man\" has faced some criticism due to the constant use of songs through the movie, almost to the point of being labeled a pseudo musical film. While this is true to an extent (the songs are really omnipresent), I think that the way they are used fits perfectly the very detailed plot, and adds an enormous amount of realism to Summerisle village and its culture.\"The Wicker Man\" may look like another typical thriller with the same kind of mystery and suspense that has been done over and over for a long long time, but it's actually one of the most intelligent and interesting movies ever made. It is a brilliantly written movie that invites its audience to question the nature of heroism and morality, and to witness how far mankind can go for their beliefs. While it really looks dated by now, it's still one of those movies where everything fits in the right place, making the movie as a whole feel like perfect. \"The Wicker Man\" is definitely a must-see, and not only for the horror genre fans. 10/10.",

The mystery behind the letter and the European feel were so much better than the remake. This also did a good job depicting the orgies and sex scenes in a fairly subtle fashion.

I'm browsing through a number of these right now. Many never made it big because they tried so hard to evoke the feel of the time. This is a great example. It is set on an island so as be more abstract, and it casts the societal difference in an oddly stark metaphor: religion. Through this we have two incongruous threads: some reference to promiscuity which we are meant to see as linked to the paganism. Well, it _was_ linked to what the paganism stands for in the movie, but the connection is too thin. For instance, in one episode, our hapless detective (who is at a loss to understand what it is going on) stumbles on a woman in a bath. Her pose is stylized as if to say: movie nudity here. The heavy lifting in this department is by Ms. Britt, whose scenes are similarly artificial, not linked to anything we see, just stuff that we evoke from the 60s.The second odd thread is the twist at the end, which is both clever and cinematic.

What is important is that the film will/should make a huge impact on you, stay with you long after you have seen it.  And though I can honestly say that this is a film that I am in no rush to see again, I must confess that it was truly horrific, truly terrifying, truly inspired.  Robin Hardy does a masterful job of direction. Lots of folks said they saw the ending coming long before it did.  I did not.  Hardy kept me totally in the dark.  Some of his camera shots are beautiful.  Girls jumping over flames on a summer day.  The scene with the dance on its way to a celebration.  The script is the backbone of the film, and as much credit goes to Anthony Shaffer as to anyone else connected with the film.  His script is filled with tension, wit, and a weird life of its own.  The acting is first-rate.  Edward Woodward plays the policeman with character, conviction, and a real sense of honor. It is his portrayal that makes the film so powerful.  He is a man we learned to like, to follow in the film as he unveils the mystery of the missing girl.  Christopher Lee does a marvelous job as do most of the actors.  And even though the movie has a little too much nudity and some bizarre songs, these really do not detract from the aura of the film but somehow enhance it.  Film poetry of its darkest nature.",

            "review_title": "A quaint island full of pagans",
            "content": "I've known about this movie for a long time, but have put off watching it for almost as long. I suppose the horrendous remake starring Nicholas Cage ruined my perception of it, but it's best to pretend that that movie never existed, much like the supposed missing girl in this movie. The film is about a policeman from the UK who is sent to a strange island off the coast of Scotland to look into the disappearance of a girl named Rowan. Soon after arriving, he is sickened to find out that the people on the island practice all these grotesque and unusual acts in order to worship their pagan gods. Sergeant Howie digs deeper into the mystery of the strange island and finds out the locals are lying about the young girl when they say she isn't real. Her existence must be kept a secret because she is apparently going to be sacrificed in some strange ritual that takes place every May. Little does Howie realize though, the girl is not the real sacrifice. He is. The islanders choose him because he came there without being invited first and is foolish. After Howie tells the leader of the Island, Lord Summerisle, that killing him won't save their harvest, he is placed inside a giant Wicker Man effigy and burned horribly to death. The ending of this movie is probably one of the most disturbing I've ever seen, and it really shows how pagan beliefs can be savage when zealots make the rules. Woodward as the police sergeant is great, and throughout the movie you can sense his frustration (and later fear) as he is lied to constantly by the islanders. Christopher Lee also plays the leader of the island, and that alone makes it worthwhile. A definitive pagan movie for sure, but also has a musical element to it.",

            "review_title": "An absolute masterpiece from beginning to end",
            "content": "Loosely based on the 1967 novel \"Ritual\" by David Pinner, this is an absolute masterpiece from beginning to end. The superb and extremely clever script by Anthony Shaffer is pitch perfect in every respect. Robin Hardy directs the material with such skill and energy that it is hard to believe that this was not only his directorial debut but that he only directed two other films, though a third is reportedly on the way. It has an atmosphere quite unlike any other that I have seen. I have seldom come across a soundtrack that adds so much to a film as the compositions by Paul Giovanni - and the accompanying ritual dances - really sell the idea that we are being confronted with a cult that has had little contact with the outside world for decades. I am most certainly a connoisseur of horror films and this is my clear favourite. While they are some very frightening and highly memorable visuals, the thing that I adore most about the film is that it concerns the evil that men do as opposed to vampires, werewolves, (on screen) gods and monsters. In this sense, it is a fascinating and thought-provoking exploration of the darker side of humanity, the mob mentality engendered by cults and the extremes to which people will go in the name of their religious beliefs. These issues are examined through the prism of paganism but it could really apply to any religion since, throughout recorded history and probably well before that, people have justified killing their enemies and committing other heinous crimes on the grounds that it is what their god or gods wanted. Unfortunately, that is unlikely to change any time soon. This film secured a place in my Top 20 when I first saw it a little over a year ago. While it is still a member of that select group, it has received a very slight demotion from 14th to 16th place. As such, it has gone from being my favourite 1970s film to my second favourite after \"A Bridge Too Far\". However, considering that the 1970s is one of my favourite film decades, that's still pretty good.The film stars Edward Woodward in one of his best performances as Sgt. Neil Howie, a devoutly Christian police officer who ventures to the remote island of Summerisle off the western coast of Scotland on April 29, 1973, two days before May Day. Having received a letter addressed to him personally, Howie has come to Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl named Rowan Morrison, who has not been seen for months. He is greatly disturbed by the fact that the inhabitants of Summerisle worship the ancient Celtic gods and get up to all sorts of degeneracy, debauchery and deviancy. He is particularly disgusted by the schoolteacher Miss Rose teaching her class of young girls that the maypole is a phallic symbol. However, a more serious concern is the conspiracy of silence that pervades Summerisle since everyone on the island, including her mother, initially denies that Rowan existed. Miss Rose later claims that she and the others were telling the truth, after a fashion, since they believe that a person's soul returns to nature \"when the human life is over.\" As such, they do not recognise death in the same manner as other, more...mainstream religions and the civil authorities. In the course of his investigation, however, Howie comes to suspect that Rowan is still alive and the islanders' celebration of May Day will not be as innocent as those which take place on the mainland. Howie's puritanical beliefs are a crucial aspect of both his character and the film itself. Woodward does an excellent job at conveying Howie's religious fervour and the sheer revulsion that he feels at the behaviour and warped sensibilities of the islanders. Although he is far less screen time that Woodward, Christopher Lee nevertheless steals the show as Lord Summerisle, the island's fiercely intelligent, very charismatic and frightening leader. His Lordship's grandfather was an agronomist who, in 1868, discovered the island's unique properties when it came to the growing of, by the British Isles' standards, exotic fruit. More to the point, the earlier Lord Summerisle fostered the belief in the islanders that the old gods would bless Summerisle with prosperity if the strains were successful. His son and grandson continued this policy to great and terrifying effect. Lee is one of my absolute favourite actors and he brings all of the considerable talent at his disposal to the role of Lord Summerisle. He loved the script so much that he agreed to do the film for the free and often described it as the best film that he made in a career that included more than 200 projects over the course of seven decades.Britt Ekland is dubbed by Annie Ross for her memorable role as the landlord's daughter Willow MacGregor, not the kind of girl that you'd bring home to your mother, but that's okay since she was never much of an actress. Anyway, I have a sneaking suspicion that she may have been hired with the very sexy yet very strange nude dancing scene in mind! Diane Cilento, who later married Shaffer incidentally, is excellent as Miss Rose, one of the more unorthodox teachers to ever grace the silver screen. The film also features strong performances from Ingrid Pitt as the rather incongruously Polish accented librarian, Aubrey Morris as the incredibly creepy gravedigger, Lindsay Kemp as the only slightly less creepy Alder MacGregor and Irene Sunter as Rowan's mother May Morrison.Overall, this is an absolutely wonderful film with some very interesting things to say about human nature. This is the sort of the film that never really leaves you once you've seen it.",

            "content": "A \u00a8must see\u00a8 picture , essential and indispensable to see ; it has plenty of intrigue and horror , though there is also ample suspense , thriller and nudism . British classic about a Scotland Yard police sergeant called Howie (Edward Woodward) is sent to a Scottish island village , Summerisle , in search of a missing girl whom the townsfolk claim never existed . The Scot police previously received an anonymous letter that implies the lost girl has been killed . There , the cop meets some rare denizens , (Diane Cilento , Britt Ekland , Lindsay Kemp , Aubrey Morris , among others) practice rare pagan rituals and pre-Celtics customs and all of them ruled by Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee who agreed to appear for free) , the aristocrat ruler and religious leader of the strange society that cultivates apples and other agriculture products . Lord Summerisle , at the beginning seems to take it all as a joke , but he subsequently discovers his real intentions . Stranger still are the weird events that ulteriorly take place there . Then , Howie swears to find out the truth . This extraordinary and harrowing film from Robin Hardy -considered to be one of the finest horror ever made- contains suspense , mystery , occult terror with gratuitous eroticism and spectacular outdoors shot in Scotland . This is one of the most unusual British films and is set in a Scottish offshore island with a community practicing bizarre pagan sexual rites . Very persuasively and intelligent script written by playwright Anthony Shaffer , author of 'Sleuth' . The flick was inspired by an engraving called \"The Wicker Image\" in Britannia Antiqua Illustrata (1676) , some people have doubted the historical existence of the Wicker Man suggesting that it came from Roman propaganda by people such as Julius Caesar ; there is , however, undeniable evidence that the Druids and the Celts practiced human sacrifice . As \u00a8The Wicker Man\u00a8 legend , however, is firmly tied in with Druidism . Nice acting by all cast , although the film is set in Scottish territory and all the characters are meant to be of Scottish nationality, all five of of the leading cast are not Scottish : Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward are English, Diane Cilento is Australian, Ingrid Pitt is Polish and Britt Ekland is Swedish . The movie was intended as a vehicle for Christopher Lee ; Lee himself has said that he considers this to be one of his greatest ever roles . The film displays a very good and colorful cinematography by Harry Waxman . The lyrics for the popular song 'Corn Rigs Are Bonnie' was actually written by Robert Burns in 1775 ; the music was written especially for the film musical score by Paul Giovanni . The final song, sung by the islanders around the sacrifice, is a thirteenth century 'reverdie' song celebrating the return of Spring . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Robin Hardy , being filmed in 1972 in Galloway in South West Scotland . Shown only in truncated copies for many years , for that reason to beware the lousy versions which may still be in circulation . This absorbing as well as exciting movie was followed by an inferior remake panned by critics and lukewarm by the world public . This new version by Neal LaBute with unsettling acting Nicolas Cage along with Molly Parker , Leelee Sobiesky , Diane Delano , being located in state of Washington . It differs on the original in various issues , as previous adaptation was in a Scotland island , the latter in State of Washington with a matriarchal society and without sexual situations , starred by a depressed patrolman (Nicolas Cage , character of Edward Woodward) affected by a car accident when receives a letter from ex-girlfriend (Kate Beaham) asking help for her disappeared daughter , he then goes to a strange matriarchal community , an Amish-alike, (ruled by Ellen Burstyn , Christopher Lee role) . Besides , first version the community cultivated apples , while in its remake are bees with drones represented by men and a Bee Queen well incarnated by Ellen Burstyn .",

            "content": "1974's The Wicker Man is another one of those little gems which is well known to genre fans but largely unnoticed by the public-at-large, which is a shame because it is a very fine film. \tAt first glance, one is tempted to think that this is another Hammer wannabe, particularly so when you learn that two of its lead players are longtime Hammer veterans Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt. However, you quickly realize during the first few minutes that this is definitely not the case, as The Wicker Man was filmed on location on an island west of Scotland and is rich in both local atmosphere and mood in ways that Hammer films are not. \tEdward Woodward plays the buttoned down police Sergeant Howie, who in the opening sequence lands his sea plane in the Bay of Summerisle. The good sergeant has come to investigate the disappearance of a 12-year old girl which was reported to his department on the mainland via letter. He is quickly taken aback by the quirky behavior of the locals and the fact that nobody seems to know anything of the missing girl, which is extremely odd because it obvious that Summerisle is very much a small community where everybody knows everybody. As the film progresses, so does our unease as we learn, step by step, that Summerisle is a pagan worshipping community lead by it's namesake leader, Lord Summerisle, portrayed by Christopher Lee in what he once said was his finest performance. Howie, a Christian lay minister and still a virgin in middle age, is shocked by what he sees going on around him and so are we, as we see, among other things, young children gaily dancing sans clothing around a maypole, a young girl putting a frog in her mouth, and the lovely Britt Ekland very direct in her attempt to seduce the policeman. We learn, too late for Howie and too late for us, the secret of Summerisle. \tLet me not give the film's superb climax away. Let me just say that Lord Summerisle found what he was looking for in Howie, in his words a `willing kinglike virgin fool,' to sacrifice to their pagan god. \tThe Wicker Man is not quite a masterpiece, but close enough and it reminds somewhat of another underrated film which came along later, 1981's Dead and Buried. We follow Howie around the island and see the island and its people through his eyes. We share in his confusion, outrage and terror. As does he, we learn too late the dark secret of Summerisle and share in his ultimate fate. \tHats off to British Lion for a wonderful film. The cast, along with outstanding camera work, made this film what it is. One gets an excellent sense of semi-rural Scotland, and even through the lens of an interesting story, the flavor of the land and its people shine through, giving one a desire to visit there. Lee, Ingrid Pitt and Britt Eklund turned in solid performances, although Lee's claim that this was his best performance seems a stretch. There were some marketing and publicity problems with The Wicker Man when it was released and one wonders what it's reputation would be today if it had been handled better. Sadly, we will never know.",

            "content": "A police sergeant (Edward Woodward) is sent to a Scottish island village in search of a missing girl whom the townsfolk claim never existed. Stranger still are the rites that take place there. While the remake of this film was a complete travesty (see other review), it had the positive side effect of exposing the original to a new audience, myself included. I am grateful for this, because \"The Wicker Man\" is wonderful.The acting is great, with a very special appearance by Christopher Lee, and the scenery is beautiful. I enjoyed the directing, and I am especially partial to the music. One scene involving a nude dance was very 1970s but also timeless for its beauty (the nudity is purely aesthetic, not erotic).The best part of this film, though, is beyond a doubt the religious overtones. While you would expect the Christian detective to be the hero, he actually comes across as more of an oppressor. His condemnation of the simple ways of the islanders make him out to be the villain, despite being the protagonist of the story. I thought this was a very clever way to tell a story... something the remake completely ignored.This is \"horror\" in a very different sense than we know today. There is no fear, no scaring the audience and little or no gore (a trickle of blood once or twice). There is almost no violence, and even the nudity is lacking in sex. Yet, somehow, there is a horror undercurrent here due to the upheaval of mainstream values with unsettling alternatives. Awesome! I don't know if I could more highly recommend this film. For those who want a slasher and guts, they're going to be disappointed and possibly confused. But those who like horror to be a little intellectual and leave you thinking, this is one for your shelves. I think the fact this film has sat quietly in the background for so many years is a shame and really ought to be changed -- can we revive the elements this film has mastered?Unfortunately, the film was \"lost\" for a while and then found, but it is unclear how good the elements werethat havebeen found. The \"final cut\" blu-ray, for example, still looks faded and washed out in many scenes, and I find it hard to believe this was intentional. If a better negative could be found, we might get a better-looking film. But that is more of a nitpick, because even on VHS it still had an impact, video quality or not.",

The community living their is led by a laird of the same name, played by Christopher Lee with his typical larger-than-life relish. Something ain't right.For the most part, the movie is a cross between an almost silly comedy in which Woodward's stiff-necked copper is constantly upstaged by the playful weirdness of the inhabitants. Their lifestyle seems to be an odd mongrel between paganism and Woodstock re-visited. Most of their ideas are utterly shocking to the policeman, who is a Christian churchgoer of the old-school. He is unworldly, inexperienced, a virgin and sullenly proud of it, and extremely uncomfortable with ideas outside of his - very small - box. They are cheerful, happy, and completely indifferent to his investigation. His lordship is equally munificent in his courtesy, and equally dismissive of the case.Britt Eckland plays Willow, the pub landlord's wife, if such a concept exists on Summerisle. She's hot to trot and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce their official lodger. We see her perform a naked dance that brings a whole new dimension to the term 'slap-happy'. (It's not actually Eckland's body we see; a more voluptuous stand-in was used).As the movie proceeds, what little tension there is mounts very slowly - almost too slowly. Sometimes it drags. Whilst throughout the meandering plot, incidental music assumes the sort of folksy froth of a tree-hugger's seminary. There's no clue to what's coming.What's coming is the titular Wicker Man. Our hapless investigator learns too late that he has been slowly inveigled to his own terrible doom.The whole thing hits like a train-wreck after an anorak's convention. You are left to watch the bright sun setting on a day that has just sent our policeman up in smoke.As I say; this is hard to categorise. You make of it what you will. It's completely off the wall. The movie that comes closest in my experience is Clint Eastwood's similarly-vintaged 'Beguiled'. Here, a wounded soldier of the American civil war strays into a secluded girls-school and also comes to a conspiratorial sticky-end.One thing's for sure; you won't forget it!",

            "content": "The Wicker Man is a horror film that will stay with you for ages, if not forever. You will never forget the shocking images, the battle between paganism and Christianity, and that unbelievable ending. Heading into the film, I was expecting something more visceral and bloody. Maybe the trailers for the 2006 ill-conceived remake brought different ideas into my head, but the chills here are more subtle. After the initial disappointment, I was entranced by this British folk horror film. It is an intelligent film that blends together a mixture of genres; horror, thriller, and musical. Yes, you have heard that last part correctly. As someone who studied history and religion, this film spoke measures to me.\nIn the 1950's and 1960's, actor Christopher Lee appeared in a series of films called Hammer Horror. While he did well in those roles, they were often devoid of much substance and Lee wanted to take on more challenging roles. He got his wish in 1971 when he met with screenwriter, Anthony Shaffer. They decided it would be fun to create a film based on \"old religion.\" Shaffer read a book called Ritual and the idea for this project was born. Later, director Robin Hardy joined the film. Everyone had to work quickly to release this film to help the studio, British Lion, avoid bankruptcy.\nAs almost as famous as this movie itself, is the story of making the film and the adventures since then. One of the most famous, and delightfully disturbing, sequences is the nude song-and-dance by Britt Ekland as she sung \"Willow's Song.\" Apparently, Ekland's voice and body image was dubbed for most of the film. While the most famous edition of the film is the brisk, 88-minute one, Hardy original cut had an additional 12 minutes...which was the one he intended to show. However, the prints were thrown away. Many people tried to find it and cobbled together different editions of the film to show the director's original intention. Director's cut or not, the film remains a terrifying tale.\nSergeant Neil Howie (Edward Woodward) is on his way to one of the islands outside Scotland to investigate the disappearance of a twelve-year-old girl, Rowan Morrison. Initially, the folks on the island tells him they do not know of the girl. As he roams the island and gets to know the people more, he increasingly becomes aware that the islanders are aware of the girl. He also sees they practice pagan worship, which differs from his strict Christian morals. He meets with Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee) where he explains the paganism; the free use of the naked body, procreation before marriage, bonfire jumping, and lots of sex. In fact, the innkeeper's daughter, Willow (Britt Eklund) attempts to seduce him. As the investigation grows deeper, Howie is led to believe that Rowan may have been murdered as a sacrifice for poor crop yield...and the islanders may not be done yet.\nEdward Woodward's faithful and bumbling cop carries the film throughout. We get under his skin and mind and of course if you are a strict religious person, you could easily understand the shock as he faces something that truly undermines his religion. And what he does in the final minutes of the film is unbelievable. He was a television actor prior to the film, and he deservedly got some great roles after the film. Lee's character is more complex than the previous monster films he has done. His character is sinister, yet sympathetic. He makes you understand the behavior of his people. Britt Eklund, a horror veteran, will seduce your mind and soul throughout this film so be forewarned.\nWithout gore and blood, you can see why The Wicker Man is a horrifying feature. Not only that, it is a study of religion. This is the sort of thing you would see during the Middle Ages, so there is a sense of reality. Upon research for the film, The Wicker Man is actually a ritual the Romans had in France to deal with prisoners. The music is very haunting, very folkish. Paul Giovanni used the music to help this feature flow the way it did. The editing is unusual, sharp, and very effective. When the movie was originally released in America, it was widely ignored. It eventually became a cult classic. Whatever you do, do not seek out the remake. Seek this film out instead. It may move along at a slow pace, but unforgettable images will scorch across your mind I promise.\nMy Grade: B+",

            "content": "Pretty much everything comes together in this movie -- the direction, the score, the performances, the script, the photography, and the location shooting.I have no idea where the writer, Anthony Shaffer, got his ideas from, but it seems like he must have sat down and done a feverish week-long reading of Frazier's \"The Golden Bough.\" He has just about everything in there and the rituals depicted, as far as I remember, are correct, though I am not sure they're all Gaelic. (The rutting in the cornfields, the \"rebirth\" through the stone cave towards the end.) Maybe in addition to Frazier we should throw in Mary Renault's \"The King Must Die\".I notice I'm skipping over a summary of the plot. This is because I'm sure it's adequately covered in other comments. Also, to be honest, it is not a very pleasant story to think about, unless you're the kind of person who gets a kick out of seeing a cat play with a doomed mouse. (Cf., John Fowles' novel, \"The Magus.\") The story anyway isn't at all plausible. It's one of those tortured schemes in which the victim is trapped because everything he does has been predicted precisely by the trappers. His slightest move has been anticipated and planned for.Back to these more or less random comments. The score is by Paul Giovanni and will knock your socks off. (There's a lot of music in the film.) There is nothing in the way of an underscore. No incidental music to speak of, except a curious \"pwong\" sound at moments of particular drama, like the discovery of a March hare in a coffin or a sunset during a sacrifice.The first song we hear is shortly after Neil Howie, the police officer, enters the village, which, by John Barleycorn, I recognized immediately as Plockton, though I haven't been there for 30 years! Okay, so Howie walks into the local pub for the first time and is greeted by friendly and happy villagers of various ages. Howie is an uptight Presbyterian and, refusing a whiskey, asks to be taken to his room by Willow (Britt Ekland), the daughter of the pub's manager. The assembled musicians then begin to play a folksy tune and the patrons sing along. And it is at that particular point in the film -- maybe 10 minutes into it -- that we realize that something is seriously awry. The song is \"The Landlord's Daughter\" and the lyrics are a little beyond \"bawdy\" and only a little short of \"obscene\". Howie stares aghast as the some of the patrons begin to swing and dance to the rhythm. Willow bumps her rump against a couple of hairy men and laughing bends over while submitting to a kind of consensual frottage. This scene is shocking and really weird as hell -- trust me.Ekland shows Howie his room upstairs and while he lies in bed, he hears her close the door to the room next to his. Then the band downstairs commences a slowly bouncing beat until a fiddle begins to play. We expect the fiddle to bring in the tune -- but no. The fiddler repeats the same note but only in something like 16th notes. (I don't want to get in over my head here.) Upstairs a naked Willow thumps her palm softly in time with the rhythm on the wall between her and the sweating, virginal police officer. She begins to dance, writhing lewdly, and sings a strange song with erotic lyrics -- \"Come to me and say 'How do?'/ Things I will give to you/ A touch as light as feather.\" I'm going to run out of space and I've hardly touched on the things that make this movie so remarkable. I can't very well NOT mention the excruciating climax of the film. (The last print I saw was lacking a few scenes, including one last entirely bleak one.) The thing has a hallucinatory quality. Odd things happen at odd times. Not only that, but they seem to tap into one's collective unconscious. It's as if all of the most primitive beliefs and rituals, the most staggering of human experiences, have come flooding out of some place you never knew existed in your brain. Half-coherent fairy tales, songs, and games, and dances from our individual childhoods and our joint pagan past parade around the edges of our perception. It is as spooky as all get out, and there is hardly any violence and not a drop of blood.Whew, what an experience.This is your comment, you may delete",

Christopher Lee plays Lord Summerisle who wants to grow fruits on the island. The crop failed and something must be sacrificed. Sargent Howe, Woodward, was written a letter about the missing girl, Morrison. First no one knows her. He persists.

            "content": "This is a truly odd little film from Britain that in spite of a rather low budget still packs an amazing punch. Edward Woodward stars as a police inspector sent to a small island off the Scottish coast to investigate the disappearance of a girl. However, when he arrives he's greeted very coldly and the locals all say they have never even heard of the child. However, as the film progresses, it becomes obvious that the locals are all a bunch of lying weasels, as Woodward is able to prove that the girl DID exist and that there is a massive conspiracy among everyone--but what, exactly, it is isn't certain. At the same time, the traditional and Christian man, Woodward, is deservedly shocked to find that the locals are all pagans. The community indulges in sex outdoors, naked fertility dances for the children and nature worship--like a group of modern day Wikkans. Where all this takes Woodward and the extremely wild but disturbing ending are all parts of the plot I really can't mention, as it would ruin the suspense, but believe me, it is REALLY, REALLY weird and haunting.Now parents must understand that this is a very, very adult movie and comes by its R rating honestly. Not only should it receive the rating because it's pretty scary, but there is quite a bit of nudity. Many adults will be amazed at the beauty of Britt Ekland's body double as she dances very seductively, but most sane parents won't want their kids watching this. If the film were only slightly edited, it would be appropriate for teens.Also, while some might find that the movie might have an anti-Christian slant, I would disagree (though I am sure the copious amounts of nudity make it problematic for some). While the town is full of pagans and they seem to have an idyllic life, Woodward's character is not some angry or hypocritical Christian and he doggedly stays with his convictions throughout the film.Once you've seen this movie on DVD, try to watch the \"making of\" featurette. It has lots of great insights and information that make the movie come alive. However there is one mistake in it, as they say that THE WICKER MAN is totally unique and while it is unusual, it is strongly inspired by Shirley Jackson's story, \"The Lottery\" and also is quite similar to the American made for TV film THE DARK SECRET OF HARVEST HOME (1978). If you like THE WICKER MAN, try to find another great film with similarities that also stars Christopher Lee--HORROR HOTEL, which is about a modern town of witches bent on evil.",

            "content": "The Wicker Man (Robin Hardy, 1973)I have to revise my original review of this film-- though, from checking every archive I can find, I'm not sure I WROTE a review of this film after first seeing it. This could turn out to be a good thing, because my original feeling for it was \"what the hell was all the fuss about,\" and after finding out that, yes, I had seen the original uncut version, my confusion deepened.Well, it's been eight months or so since then, and the thing's crept into my consciousness. Repeated viewings have had exactly the same effect they had with Argento's masterpiece Suspiria, to wit:viewing #1: what the hell was all the fuss about? viewing #2: I can see where there are some points made and subtexts in this film that would greatly appeal to the people who held this thing up in such high regard to me, and Ed Woodward and Chris Lee are very fine actors (and Britt Ekland unclothed is always worthwhile), but it's still kind of, forgive the pun, wooden. viewing #3: My god, this is a profound film. viewing #4: Why hasn't the rest of the world clued into how great this is? (Probably because it was so badly mangled in its original release that it left a bad taste in the mouths of many, from what I've been told.)This film was the directorial debut of Robin Hardy, who has since gone on to direct only one other film and a few episodes of a TV series (read: mysterious shadowy figure). It was the brainchild of Anthony Shaffer, a name that should be well known to all film buffs (Frenzy, Sleuth, Death on the Nile, Sommersby, et al.). It stars Edward Woodward, already a veteran TV actor by the early seventies, as the uptight Sergeant Howie, a Scottish constable who decides to investigate an anonymous tip-off that a thirteen-year-old girl named Rowan Morrison has been abducted on a small island famous for its apples. Howie's nemesis, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee looking surprisingly young, given that he was over fifty when he played this role), flits in and out of the film, dropping hints that all is not, perhaps, as it seems, but offering all the help he can given that Howie doesn't seem to understand that police procedure doesn't have to go by the book. After all, you can only offer someone so much help if he doesn't see where you're going with it.Yes, there are a lot of things about this film, on the surface, that could have been done better. It was obviously made on a shoestring budget that didn't have room for a Steadicam or top-quality film. Unfortunately, that leads to unconscious links about other things in the film that are supposed to look primitive (the islanders' costumes for the Mayday celebration, for example), and the first-time viewer tends to knock the film for things that should be praised because of it.As for the content of the film itself, the acting is, as one would expect from names like Woodward, Lee, and Ekland, easily above average. The plot moves along quite effortlessly, and the underlying subtext, while strongly presented, never gets in the way of a bang-up mystery (and while the ending becomes somewhat obvious about two-thirds of the way through the film, by then you've realized that the resolution to the mystery isn't what this film is about at all, and you-- or at least I-- become willing to cut Shaffer and Hardy a lot of slack). The scenery-- and no, you dirty-minded little nappers, I'm not talking about Britt Ekland's infamous naked dance-- is breathtaking, from the opening credits panning over Howie's district, to the very end. \"But,\" you're saying, \"all of these things are true about many other films that have probably been forgotten thirty years after they were made.\" True. And what keeps The Wicker Man firmly entrenched in the heads of so many, I'd warrant, is the gorgeous and profoundly influential soundtrack to this film. The main theme (which is untitled, but for years I've heard it referred to as \"The Wicker Man Song;\" Sneaker Pimps released a version of it in 1997 with the title \"How Do\") is rapidly becoming one of the world's most covered songs, and all the songs in the film are extremely well executed. (Also in the \"mysterious shadowy figure\" vein, composer Paul Giovanni never scored another film.) I've no idea whether these songs were written especially for the film or whether they're traditional, and I can't find a single Internet resource capable of telling me, but this film is worth buying simply for the music. The rest will come to you. Trust me on this. Christopher Lee-- who holds the record of having been in more films than anyone else (ever!)-- considers The Wicker Man his finest work. I haven't seen everything Christopher Lee's ever been in (I'm not sure there's a living soul aside from Lee himself who has!), but I'd have to agree with him based on what I've seen. Once The Wicker Man has you, it has you for life. **** 1/2(Note: the film has presently been verified in release in three versions: 87 minutes, 95 minutes, and 102 minutes, with the 102 minute version considered the \"uncut\" version, which is selling for close to $100 in many places. Don't believe the hype-- I got mine for $12 on ebay. It is rumored that a full version of the film, which runs 122 minutes, DOES exist somewhere and has never been released.)",

            "content": "The Wicker Man is an outstanding horror film from 1973 - perhaps the finest British horror film of all-time, and certainly a film that weaves an absorbing spell on a whole range of levels. It is not a horror film in the sense of buckets of blood and gore. Nor is it a horror film with ghosts and creaking doors and strange sounds in the night. The film plays out more like an enigmatic mystery thriller, with the horror coming right at the very end when we learn where the narrative has been leading us all along. In fact, The Wicker Man has a classic climax that will both surprise and unsettle viewers who are new to the movie. It is an ending far more memorable, and horrific in a subtle way, than any shock moment in, say, an Italian gore film.Deeply religious Christian policeman Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) flies out to the remote Scottish island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. Almost immediately upon arriving, he finds the islanders alternately unwelcoming or downright peculiar. The missing girl's mother, May Morrison (Irene Sunters), claims that she never even had a daughter; the locals in the island pub refuse to acknowledge the girl's existence; and at the island school, the pupils and the teacher (Diane Cilento) say they've never heard of the missing girl. Howie is equally perturbed by some of the other events he witnesses - the pub landlord willingly surrenders his daughter for sexual hijinks; the children at the school are taught about phallic imagery and are encouraged to dance naked through flames; pagan symbols are to be found everywhere. The entire island seems lost under the sinister spell of Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), and Sgt. Howie becomes increasingly certain that his missing girl may be the victim of some kind of pagan sacrifice....To reveal much more would be to rob the viewer of a staggering conclusion. Let's just say that Howie finds out all too plainly what is really going on by the film's end. Woodward gives a career-best performance in the film, etching a remarkable portrayal of a devout man who is so bound to his moral code that he is sometimes as dislikable as he is honourable. Lee excels too as the island's top man - this is one of the great roles of his prolific career. The film switches from police mystery to pagan horror, with frequent pauses for atmospheric folk songs, and is at all stages a work of real intelligence. In both its shorter theatrical version and the longer Director's Cut, it tells an enthralling story while keeping its trump card cunningly disguised. There aren't many movies in the history of the medium that are genuine \"must sees\".... The Wicker Man, though, is one of the few!",

            "content": "How does a film be so good? Well every one of them has their flaws, and I'm sure even this, The Wicker Man, does, yet it's guaranteed that you'll surpass whatever flaws the film may hold due to the pure brilliance it beholds. Written by Anthony Schaffer (Sleuth, Frenzy) and directed by one hit wonder of film, Robin Hardy who is previously working on a somewhat another adaptation of his 1973 work called 'Cowboys for Christ', The Wicker Man is one of the best any could ever see.The Wicker Man is a great film; that's basically what I'm going to try to get across. The messages and themes in this movie are so phenomenal and elements bizarre, that its hard to believe people out their actually hate this movie. Whilst at first the film gives a some what biased message against Christianity, the movie unfolds into a matter of religion being some what a muddle in general due to human kind's way of behaving upon it. A film that strikes a message across over mans obsession over religion? Yes, it works, and oh how it does.The plot is as follows; Sergeant (Neil) Howie receives a letter from anonymous from Summerisle, a small secluded Scottish island consisting of a community with some what odd and different believes from the mainland's religion and culture which possibly fall into Paganism. The letter explains of a missing girl called Rowan Morrison. Howie, being an incredibly strict Christian, so strict that he refuses to have sexual intercourse before marriage, and strict to his career as a police officer, is given nothing but \"nonsense and rubbish\" as he asks the whereabouts of Rowan Morrison, and other questions to follow, which ends with a festival called May Day which lives up to the films poster art work. This is where the questioning of your personal beliefs comes in. Howie seems to be very closed minded and strict about the culture of the people on Summerisle, and although you may think the people of the island think the opposite back, they too are quite ignorant and \"insane\" due to their beliefs and religion hence \"God is dead, he had his chance\".The film has an amazing pace, and along the whole feature there are scenes such as a girls nasal passage wrapped around a tree on her grave, and a jar of foreskins in a local shop which makes this film so different and obscure like no other because of its exploration into unheard territories of religion(s) and culture that we as the majority of society may be very unaware of. Another thing about The Wicker Man is its incredible realistic portraying of \"pagan\" cultures, where as in the remake we see people running around in brown and white robes, and in this film we see them as normal and well presented people living on an island isolated from their culture, but not living in the 1800's or anything ridiculous and far-fetched. The film does play on its characters to represent the message of accepting one another's cultures, religion, beliefs etc.Not only has this but the movie has a certain spark of music to it. Along the whole movie there is folk like music that occasionally makes its way into the film and suits in very fine to what scenes it connects with, such as the scene between Howie and Willow (Britt Ekland) and their moment despite their separation of different rooms. The music adds more to the islander's crazy, fun yet somewhat enlightening religion.The acting from almost every character and actor in the film is remarkable. Edward Woodward does an absolute spectacular job as the strict, up tight \"no fun\" police officer, and his character works so well with him, its not only convincing, but you begin to get annoyed by his character for being so, as many would say \"boring\" and yet we as the audience can understand just how he feels about the way things are run on Summerisle, and in the end there is a complete character change, that makes you feel so gloomy over the ending of the film. Even Edward Woodward's character went on to inspire the Simon Pegg's character of Nicholas Angel in Hot Fuzz (2007) in which Woodward himself stars in too. Christopher Lee has always has a certain enigma about him as an actor, in the James Bond film The Man With the Golden Gun he plays a mysterious and intellectual man which is convincing, not only due to his acting abilities but his facial expression, height and so on. Even today in films such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) he still has a morbid yet intelligent character about him despite he is only on screen for a few moments. All the extras of the film that appear on Summerisle also have this mysterious character about them. The sort of \"they know something I don't\" act is seen through whole movie by all the citizens of the island. Christopher Lee's role as Lord Summerisle has got to be one of the most influential and amazing performances I have ever seen on screen, and I'm sure there's more than a handful that agree with me.The Wicker Man, no matter how unheard of the film may be, should be seen by everyone who actually has a care left about film. This movie toys with personal beliefs and religion, and doesn't necessarily portray specific messages, but gives the viewer their own thought on the subject of religion, culture and beliefs. This land mark in film history will never be forgotten as long as people uphold its pure brilliance, no matter how many people say it isn't a horror film, and no matter how many remakes it may have. The Wicker Man has stood the test of time and as long as religion stays on the planet, this film will always stand the test of time.",

It really is one of the most stunning films that were ever unleashed upon the world. Unique is the most appropriate word that comes to mind in order to describe it. The Wicker Man is unlike any film you ever saw and an entire chapter of British cinema history to itself. Usually, it takes many parties to create a masterpiece but I dare to say The Wicker Man is largely Anthony Shaffer's accomplishment. His screenplay almost is too brilliant to put into words. The tiniest details and the slightest side-aspects are worked out perfectly. As a viewer, you'll literally feel like you're there\u0085on Summerisle! No matter how illogical the plot may sound, the Wicker Man feels disturbingly real and alarming. Simply categorizing it as horror would do injustice to this versatile work of art. The fear and uncomfortable emotions it causes definitely are horror, but in the very first place this is a compelling mystery and a rough religious portrait. Actually, I don't want to give away too many plot aspects. The matter is far too fascinating to spoil and the solid story is so intelligent that a short summary wouldn't bring it any honor. Yes, I have that much respect for this film!! Just look at all the devout professionalism and be astonished as well! Another amazing aspect about The Wicker Man is the tempting soundtrack\u0085with a slight bit of imagination; you could actually call it a musical. The music and the film make one terrific wholesome here, and that's a pretty rare achievement. Only in the ancient European exploitation, you can find a similar music-picture relationship. A good cast finishes it all. Edward Woodward shines in the leading role and Christopher Lee portrays the most memorable character in his entire remarkable career as Lord Summerisle. And then there's Britt Ekland as Willow! Unquestionably the most gorgeous lady in the British horror industry. Frankly, you haven't lived until you see (and hear) her sing her Siren's Song\u0085This film deserves a spot in the IMDb top 250 more than any other motion picture ever did before.

At first the locals seem very uncooperative & deny anyone named Rowan Morrison ever lived there, as Sergeant Howie carries out his investigation it quickly becomes apparent that the inhabitants of Summerisle are in fact Pagan worshippers who believe in human sacrifice & have lied to him. Howie fears Rowan might have been murdered but the truth, when revealed, is even more horrifying...This British production was directed by Robin Hardy & is a classic piece of horror with excellent storytelling. First off I'll say that there seems to be various versions of The Wicker Man floating around that range in length from under 90 minutes to over 100, from the original theatrical cut to the director's cut there are definitely a few different versions out there & I'm honestly not to sure which one I saw so bear that in mind. Anyway, the script by Anthony Shaffer first of hooks you with the mystery surrounding the missing girl & then presents a Pagan world where Christianity doesn't exist, it's a world where children dance naked around fires, where a mother tries to cure her daughter's sore throat by putting a toad in her mouth, where children are taught twisted ideas about sex, where there are no Church's or ministers & where the villagers openly have sex in public. It's all rather unnerving & pretty creepy as well, the character's are brilliantly developed, the dialogue is very effective but it's perhaps it's fantastic twist ending that The Wicker Man will be best remembered for as it's simply superb & has tremendous impact. The whole film has been thought through carefully & the sustained build up to it's climax works brilliantly, as a horror film, as a mystery, as a warning & it's original, it's considerably different from just about any other horror film I've ever seen anyway.Director Hardy does a great job here, who would have thought some pretty terrible sounding folk songs could be so creepy & unnerving? There's a great atmosphere to The Wicker Man although there aren't really any out and out scares, it has it's fair share of nudity but lacks any real gore or violence but when a film is this good & has such an excellent story that's as brilliantly told as The Wicker Man the lack of gore isn't a consideration.Technically the film is good, shot on location in Dumfries & Galloway in Scotland it makes for the perfect backdrop. The music plays a big part in The Wicker Man & it's very atmospheric & unsettling. The acting is strong from all involved, Woodward is very good, Christopher Lee states that this is maybe the best thing he's ever done while the Swedish Britt Ekland takes her clothes off.The Wicker Man is considered a cult classic & it's an accusation I have a hard time arguing with, however as always there are going to be people out there who 'don't get it' or simply don't like it & that's fine because we are all entitled to an opinion. Having said that I'm pleased to know there seems to many more out there who definitely like it rather than not, personally I think it's a great film & it's as simple & straight forward as that. Remade by Hollywood & starring Nicholas Cage as The Wicker Man (2006) & interestingly set for another remake or 'reimagining' as they like to describe it by director Robin Hardy as Cowboys for Christ (2007) again starring Christopher Lee.",

            "content": "After reading many praising reviews I was very motivated to watch The Wicker Man. First I considered watching the remake with Nicolas Cage first. But nobody seemed to be happy with that version and decided to leave that alone for now. So I watched the original and to be honest I am at a loss of words. This movie has to be one of the most overrated movies ever made. If you can even call this a movie. It was more of a musical than a conventional movie about cult traditions. As a true thriller / horror this fails miserably.Be warned this review will contain (mild) spoilers.From the moment Edward Woodward comes to the island it is obvious that something will happen to him. You don't have to be a genius to discover that. He is called to the island in order to find a missing girl. During his investigation he soon finds out that strange things are going on like villagers running around naked, having sex on the beach, pagan rituals, villagers singing songs. And because of this he suspects foul play. After witnessing these strange events you really beginning to expect that the viewer also is being made a fool of. The so called twist isn't a twist but just an ending. Since the result of the event in the end doesn't get revealed. This annoyed me a great deal. What was the point of this movie? To entertain me, to shock me, to educate me on ignorance or other man's religion? This movie is neither thrilling, scary or exciting. I did laugh at some scenes since it was so ridiculous. But overall it was so dull and irritating. Not once does the sergeant call for backup. Maybe he was proud, but he seemed quite intelligent so why didn't he? And if you suspect foul play you are not going to announce that. Certainly not to the people who you can't trust. In this case the whole village couldn't be trusted. It could be that he was blinded by his sense of justice. But even then it is a bit far fetched that he didn't make more of an effort to leave the island to get help. I really tried my best to understand why many reviewers liked this movie. I can only speculate and will keep those thoughts to myself since they can be considered rude. I do think that this movie is really bad. If it wasn't for Edward Woodward, Christopher Lee and some beautiful women I would fall a sleep. I am not a fan of musicals and I already had doubts of combining song and dance with thriller elements. The result is a movie that thanks to strange events and some songs starts out interesting but ultimately fails in surprising the viewer. No matter from what angle you look at it. The real mystery and horror to me is the fact that they have made a remake of this poor movie. Why not make a movie about that thought and process? That would be far more intriguing and interesting than this.",

The locals seem odd, but he is intent on finding her and decides to persist, despite increasing hostility from the natives. The islanders' behaviour grows more and more bizarre and it soon becomes clear that they worship the old pagan faith, a faith that demands bloody rituals and levels of sexual openness that Woodward's staunchly devout Christian belief finds repellent. Christopher Lee plays the Lord of the Isle, a man who controls his people through the pagan religion his ancestors allowed to thrive on the island. Lee is excellent as the charming, but deadly sinister Lord. As the film reaches its crescendo, Woodward finds that he has been deceived and must pay the ultimate price: the girl's disappearance was but a ruse to lure Woodward to the island to make him the latest human sacrifice. The final scene sees Woodward burned to death in a giant wicker man, the islanders chanting their chants. Aside from an infuriatingly awful soundtrack, The Wicker Man delivers as a chilling demonstration of deception and horror.",

But also a very predictable one. Even if you haven't watched that many movies, you kind of know where this one is going. To make matters worse, this guy is all alone on an island, where everybody seems to be crazy. Or indeed they are if we'd judge them by our civilized standards. So the ending is inevitable.Although I thought the guy could at least die a hero. If you remember the ending, he (the cop) comes out of the cave with the girl. He's standing over a cliff. He should then realise that there is no way out (no escaping the island) for him. While he's on the edge and Dr. Sommerisle (Christoper Lee) is standing there with him. Now while he might have still the survival instinct in him and tries to get away from there, it has to be clear to him that there is nowhere for him to go, when he sees the town folks appear on top of that cliff. They block any way for him to escape, so where does he try to go? He should've tried to tackle/grab Dr. Sommerisle and take a fall with him down to their certain deaths ... That's at least what I think would be right for this character to do ... but then you wouldn't have this climax ending with the fire, of course.Despite all that, this movie grabs you with the suspense that it is building (although in some parts it just is too long) and delivers very good acting performances. I've seen the 99 minutes version and the 80-something minutes version. The longer version has a more believable beginning, so I'd say it's the better one :o)",

            "review_title": "An misunderstood cult classic that became a legend (9/10)",
            "content": "(***Possible Spoilers...***)Anyone reading the various posts on the comments page can read the plot so I won't bother with that...Instead what I have to note about people's views on The Wicker Man (in general as well as on IMDb) is that the film is so easily misunderstood. At face value I can understand that people are disappointed with what they presumably expected to be a straight horror film. However, this film is the best kind of film... a 'grower', one that the more you delve into it and learn about it sucks you in and enthralls you more and more. It's true that the film suffered many set backs during both production and post-production (for instance attempting to shoot a film about the may day festival in the middle of Autumn - a lot of the tree blossoms in the film had to be 'stuck on') but it's this which gives it that unfulfilled potential and quirky charm that allows it a cult status. The script is brilliant and the acting (Britt Ekland aside) is valiant, especially considering most of the locals were indeed actual, untrained locals. It really is Christopher Lee's best role (he delights in mocking his own previous roles whilst delivering an all together more sophisticated performance than in any of those hammer horror parts).In fact, The Wicker Man is mislabeled as a 'horror' film, it's unclassifiable (why people are so obsessed with trying to classify it I have no idea)... its more like a play than a film really, but then what would you expect from the writer of \"Sleuth\"?What really gets me, however, about the film, which so many people seem to miss (or choose to miss) is that its a perfect satire of the time it was made. Depending on which side of the fence they fall, people seem to disagree upon whether the islanders are the good guys or Sgt. Howie is, whether it is a film celebrating Christianity or paganism. Truth is and the point is its neither.The early seventies (post summer of love, hippy revolution etc.) was a time of increased freedom of thought and action all over the world especially in the USA and Europe. More and more people at this time were rejecting Christianity and I guess what you could call 'orthodox' religion. The seventies saw a significant rise in the number of people dabbling in what they would call Pagan spirituality (although I'm sure true pagans would complain that they were merely following a trend and had no true belief at all) as a opposed to that of God. Personally I'm an agnostic and do not like to judge any followers of any kind of faith, but this whole film is a well constructed diatribe about the follies of any kind of organised worship. The whole movie is peppered with endless similarities between the pagan worship and that of Christianity. Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle is constantly pointing these out to Edward Woodward. It's Howie's closed mindedness and complete rejection of the Islanders right to a different faith that leads to his doom, however as he learns from Lord Summerisle himself, the only reason the pagans worship so on the island is because his late great grandfather used it as a way of controlling the workers that first lived there. The reason for the bountiful fruit crops growing on Summerisle is down to volcanic soil on the island, the pagan religion was merely carried on as a kind of tradition. At the end (SPOILER WARNING...) Howie shouts something along the lines of to Summerisle:\"What will happen if the crops fail again this year? They'll have to use the next best sacrifice and only the Lord of Summerisle himself will do...\"\u0085pointing out that Summerisle's lie will end up with his own demise. The point of view of the film is that rejecting one faith and merely replacing it with a closed minded fanaticism of another however different makes you just as chained and no gives you no more freedom of thought or action.The screenplay is wonderful, detailed and purposefully leaves you at odds as to who's side you should be on. As in life, it's not a clear cut affair. Still, amazing film and I personally wouldn't want it to be perfect because discovering it, laughing along with it and at it and being chilled by is all part of its charm.",

But slowly, but surely, we get on his side, see his logic, until we have the giant pay-off at the end.(What an end it is - shame that so many people know about it before viewing. I didn't and couldn't stand up for about five minutes.)Christopher Lee has his best film role as the feudal lord and ring leader, although that says more about his anything-if-the-money-is-right choices. We also have Brit Ekland in the undressed (or was it a double?) form of her life.Maybe the film was a happy accident - one of these films where the parts fall in to place almost by themselves?

It isn't really a horror film, or a murder mystery or even a black comedy, but contains elements of all three. This is, however, one of the most clever films I have ever seen.Devoutly religious police officer Neil Howie arrives on Summerisle seeking a missing child, a little girl named Rowan. He finds a community virtually cut off from the rest of the world who have reverted to a pagan lifestyle. Howie is quite shocked and morally outraged to see women dancing naked in the fields around bonfires, couples having sex right out in the open where anyone can see, grade school teachers instructing the class in fertility lore and herbalists healing with frogs. He is also sorely tempted by Willow, the Innkeepers daughter played by Britt Ekland, who tries to lure Howie into her bedroom with a song and a naked dance. Of course, he resists. Everyone seems quite amused by his piousness and not very concerned with the disappearance of Rowan. When he finds a hare buried in Rowan's grave, the angry Howie confronts Lord Summerisle, played with perfection by Christopher Lee in one of his favorite roles. Slowly, Howie comes to learn the truth; a virgin is needed for a sacrifice due, and the virgin in question may be Rowan...or it may not be.There's only one word for this film: stunning. There are no clich\u00e9s here, no standard film formulas. This is so original that I truly did not see what should have been the obvious plot twist coming, and was quite surprised and shocked by the unforgettable ending. The cast is absolutely flawless, the visuals are impressive and haunting and the film is filled with lovely folk music throughout. Viewers charmed by the simple, nature-loving folk of Summerisle will not soon forget the final harrowing scenes. If it doesn't make you say \"wow\" nothing much will.10 stars for this innovative treasure.",

The plot is good, the acting great, the soundtrack is appropriate and the erotic dancing of Swedish beauty Britt Ekland is something I would have never expected from a movie from that time. Or maybe we are getting more Victorian than they ever were in the 70s.Anyway, this is an intense thriller, dealing mostly with feelings of social weirdness. In fact it is so intense that I felt the need to make a pause after an hour or so. And it is a psychological thriller, no gore, no murders or monsters or anything like that. I especially liked the fact that the pagan religion of the island wasn't actually portrayed as silly and evil. Quite the opposite. The religiously active policeman didn't go out into hysterical fits either, and we see on the actor how the character is split between his deep Christian beliefs and his job as a a police officer.To conclude, if you liked Children of the Corn you will absolutely love this one. It's deeper, with more script to it and a lot more acting. I wonder how the 2006 remake will be, I hope they didn't trim it down in order to appeal to both dumb and pious people that bring their children along.",

Neill Howie (Woodward) is a policeman from the mainland who is called to a small island off the west coast of Scotland called Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a 12 year old girl. The Sergeant is immediately taken back by the strange people on the island. They lie to him at every turn and there is a general lack of Christian morality everywhere he looks. On his first night he is tempted by the Inn's sexy daughter (Ekland) who dances nude on the other side of the wall to entice him to join her. Sgt. Howie is an upstanding Christian who is still a virgin so he is able to fight off the temptation. Even though he has jurisdiction on the island, no one is willing to help him find the missing girl. He is eventually brought to meet Lord Summerisle (Lee) who informs the sergeant that the girl is dead. He further shocks the Sergeant by telling him the Island and its people worship the Gods of nature are all Pagans. He is urged to leave their Island before their May Day celebration the next day. Sgt. Howie attends the ceremony in disguise, believing that the missing girl is still alive and is going to be sacrificed. *Spoiler Alert* He actually finds the girl alive only to realize that he is the one the cult wanted all along. He is brought to a hillside where a giant wooden wicker man is waiting for him. Along with animals, he is to be burned alive as a sacrifice. All though highly rooted in its era of the early 1970's, this British film is a well-crafted chiller that has one of the best Horror twist endings of all time. With its history of poor distribution and Christopher Lee saying this is one of his favorite roles; The Wicker Man has achieved true cult status. The film doesn't scare you with jumps or shocks. Instead it weaves a tone of creepiness from the beginning until the horrifying and shocking conclusion which stays with you long after it's over. Enough cannot be said about the lead performance by Edward Woodward. A lesser performance could have made this film unravel, but you never doubt the believability of this character, and Woodward should get the praise for this. Director Robin Hardy, working from a script by Anthony Shaffer, puts the audience behind the eyes of the lead character. We're trying to figure out the strange Island and its people just like Sgt. Howie is. It's obvious something sinister is at work and we experience the film from his perspective which is one of the strengths of the film. Britt Ekland's nude dance is erotic and memorable, and the many odd scenes this film has stacks up to make a scary and memorable Horror film.",

Shaffer had read the David Pinner novel Ritual - which had first been written as a script for Michael Winner and I can't even imagine what he would have done - and turned that inspiration into his own story.Shaffer wanted the story to be about what happened when modern religion and the old pagan ways meet. There was to be no blood or gore; it was about the kind of horror that just sneaks up on you, always there, something unknown and yet unfathomable. I guess people need a handle for it and call it folk horror today.This film feels at the crossroads of art and horror; Performance meets The Devil Rides Out except the rules no longer exist.

Instead, it's about the new ways and the ways that have been for much longer than modern man can know.Christian Sergeant Neil Howie (Edward Woodward) is presented at first as the virtuous hero; he's at the island of Summerisle looking into the disappearance of Rowan Morrison. Yet the villagers refuse to admit that she ever existed.He's shocked at the ways of these people, who put frogs in their mouths to cure illness and dance around phallic maypoles. He finds the images of the past May Queens. He meets Lord Summerisle (Lee), the man who leads this village. And he finds the answers that he seeks, despite perhaps not liking them.There's also tempted by Willow MacGregor (Britt Ekland, who was three months pregnant, she was dubbed by Annie Ross and her body double was dancer Rachel Verney) and there's a scene where she dances with a wall between her and Howie that is volcanic. It doesn't have any nudity but it's filled with sensual energy.Director Robin Hardy also made The Fantasist and The Wicker Tree, a very loose sequel to the original movie. Hardy first published the sequel as a novel, Cowboys for Christ and it's about American Christian evangelists who travel to Scotland and end up in a similar situation. Lee plays a character called the Old Gentleman who is either or who is not Summerisle.Shaffer also wrote The Loathsome Lambton Worm, a direct sequel that begins immediately after the ending of The Wicker Man with Howie saved by his fellow police officers. It has a fire-breathing dragon and is much more fantastic than the first movie.",

Superimposed on this core content is an excellent performance by Edward Woodward, a reasonably good one by Christopher Lee, the total irrelevance of Britt Ekland (and her admittedly beautiful nude stand-in) and the extremely irritating minor characters and (I'm a Scot) the strange variety of accents.There is some beautiful scenery and an admittedly shocking conclusion leading one either to exclaim \"So what?\" or to wax eloquent about Christ's sacrifice morally inverted, or some such profound thoughts which, truth to say, the content of the film doesn't really merit.Oh, and it is quite funny in places. I could certainly watch it again a number of times, but I suspect that it might just get funnier rather than more shocking and profound. I'll report back differently if otherwise.",

In short, the pagans are testing him since he won't do for the wicker man if he's not \"pure\". Anyhow, I think that's the point beyond giving guys like me a cheap thrill.No need to embroider the obvious. The movie is indeed original and one of the best combination mystery-horror films on record. That first shot of the wicker man silhouetted against the sky is a real stunner. Then too, note the way each side in this culture clash mouths its magical incantations at the moment of truth, all the while the setting sun looks on indifferently. Woodward is excellent as the dogged sergeant. He's just the right mix of prig and authority, an upright guy who long ago gave up trying to think outside the box. I guess my only complaint is Summerisle's (Lee) silly wig. Then again, maybe it's supposed to be, but for what purpose.No doubt about it, the movie's a real grabber from start to finish.

One of the few problems here is the fact that there are some really bland and unappealing folk songs throughout here that just make this one feel overlong and quite bland. The numerous musical interludes really overwhelm this one as they're not that good and really don't offer up much of anything for the film other than getting in some nice innuendo, but on the whole it's not that appealing to stop the film cold to feature yet another suggestive local song-and-dance that's already mentioned before or to have an utterly obnoxious folklore tune continually play out. There's also a rather big problem here with the central mystery that unfolds here, simply providing a series of behavior that he finds weird only due to the contrast against the Christian ideologies he keeps spouting off yet none of these events really have much of a horror or even suspense setup as their standoff-ish behavior and mysterious rituals don't have any building suspense. The whole first hour plays out like a sardonic fish-out-of-water tale rather than any kind of macabre overview of a horror film as it boils down to a continuous series of run-ins with free-spirited folks who stonewall his investigations and scoff as his views of their practices which really hinders the film somewhat. There's still a lot to like here despite these issues, as there's a wicked air under the surface here as the weirdness of their transgressions slowly reveals far more menacing tones. The way it shows their attention to the pagan religion spurning his efforts with their brazen worship of paganism iconography and symbolism, the lax attitude to sexuality that shows copious couplings in public spaces, nude worshipping practices and the induction of children into sexually explicit conversations which are then thrown back at him with a rather easy-going dismissal that works a rather involving mystery here as they overlay these with the slowly unfolding mystery about the girl. This is certainly aiding nicely with the events of the finale which is undoubtedly the highlight here with the absolutely crazy ritual procession through the town as the garish costumes and jovial dancing creates some fully impressive sequence which comes off nicely alongside the central twist here that makes for a truly harrowing and cruel twist that really works well here. That gives this a considerable amount of good parts over the flaws, and along with the fine nudity throughout gives this a lot to really enjoy about this one.Rated R: Full Nudity, Violence, Language, some sexual conduct and intense themes of children-in-jeopardy.",

The townspeople are clearly hiding something and soon Howie begins to think that their leader (Christopher Lee) might be hiding the girl for a Pagan sacrifice. The history of THE WICKER MAN is just about as interesting as the film itself. If you're slightly familiar with the picture then you know that it was released to rather lukewarm reviews and there's no question that people weren't lining up to see it. After all, horror films during this era were a lot more in your face and they certainly wasn't as mature as this. After several edits the film pretty much went away until eventually being rediscovered and becoming a classic.If you've never seen THE WICKER MAN then it's best that you don't read too much about the plot other than you have a cop on a mysterious island looking for a girl who might have been murdered. Everything in the first two-thirds of the movie are just build-up for the conclusion of the film, which has to be one of the creepiest in history. This isn't an in=your-face shocker but instead I've always seen it as a bizarre religious film that slowly creeps up on you.I've always loved the performances in the film and especially that of Woodward. He is very stern here and you could say that his character is a jerk at times but I've always thought this was a great way to play the character. To prevent spoilers I won't talk about Woodward's greatest acting but it's certainly a chilling moment. Lee was always great at playing these cult leaders and he too delivers a wonderful performance. Fan favorites Ingrid Pitt and Britt Ekland are also on hand.The music is terrific, the cinematography great and there's no question that director Robin Hardy perfectly builds everything up to the climax. I would say that some of the musical numbers might have been better left out but the overall experience of THE WICKER MAN is quite grand.It should be added that there are three versions out there. The 88- minute theatrical cut should pretty much be avoided at all costs. Not only is it missing a lot of scenes but it's also re-arranged and not really worth watching. The 99-minute extended cut is without question the best version. The 94-minute version known as \"The Final Cut\" would be the second best version but I must admit that I'm not sure why this version was made or even needed considering most are going to go with the extended version.",

Surely there's some kind of nostalgia involved for the Wicker Man is deeply rooted in this 60s into 70s period where Old Society collides with Hippie Utopias.Basically the movie is flat: nothing ever comes ahead of the premise. Police officer comes to investigate the disappearance of a young girl in an remote Scottish community. He suspects murder and these people's customs are very strange indeed. No suspense as he goes from rational to grotesque and upsetting discoveries and the copper hero himself is a caricature of the bland emotion-steering British civil servant.On the other hand the local population is rather funny, barely wicked but mostly over-the-top for the discrepancy between abrupt rationality and insidious insanity is too huge for us to feel at ease with either side. The one we would like to root for is of course Christopher Lee who gets a magnificent role that he acts with splendid talent. Unfortunately his character doesn't take over the lead and gets stuck with the rest of the movie in the grand-guignol and would-be-clever ending.On the whole see it only if you're interested in Lee's performance or studying 60s-70s sociology through the movies.",

            "content": "\"The Wicker Man\" starts as a mystery about the disappearance of a young girl in a remote Scottish location named Summerisle. But very quickly, small hints of weirdness are left like Tom Thumb's white pebbles in the way of the police investigation conducted by the no-nonsense and uptight Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward). And as he follows the trail, Howie starts looking at the villagers with suspicion, then astonishment, then disgust. But strangely enough, no fear.The trick with Robin Hardy's film is that although the story is told from a first person POV like a detective flick; there's one thing we know that Howie does not: it is a horror film, one even coined as \"The Citizen Kane\" of the genre and so we know something creepy is impending. And the tension is less heightened by the instances of horrific events but by our anticipation. But then what could possibly be horrific where the closest to antagonists are regular, colorful folks, including old people, women and young lassies?But Howie, remarkably played by Woodward, is never quite in a state of fear, which is a novelty for a horror film, it's only where confronted to the truth that he can make the 180\u00b0 turn. And the film never totally prepares us for that ending, no matter how much weirdness the plot works on, the shock is there, totally unpredictable and its effect is just sheer terror not lingering on any hope not any suspense hanging on a last minute salvation. Indeed, once the reality of the eponymous wicker man takes its full form, you've got one of the most unforgettable conclusions of any film with a final shot that won't get wiped from your memory any sooner.And so as far as the genre is concerned, the horror is there but not the conventional one you might expect. Consider movies made the same year like \"The Exorcist\" or \"Don't Look Now\", both relied on conventional tropes: night-time, jump scares, violence and gore... \"The Wicker Man\" has none of that. As a matter of fact, it's mostly set in broad daylight and no act of violence is committed for a good portion of the film. The first unsettling effect comes from the feeling of a conspiracy induced by the way the local people (usually friendly and cooperative) are very quick to say that Rowan doesn't belong to the village. And since everyone seems to undermine the investigation with a malice that progressively loses its discretion, it's pretty evident that Howie is alone in that turf.Then the atmosphere gets even stranger as there's something puzzling in the way hints are so ostensibly left, that one might take them as cheap contrivances worthy of a B picture.. after all, if you're tying to cover for the disappearance of a little girl, why have the spot left by a potentially incriminating photograph visible like the nose in the middle of a face... if she's not part of the school, why leave an empty seat, or a register that still contains her name... there's something so awkwardly convenient between the way the inhabitants are hiding a secret and the way they leave loose ends that you're tempted to believe this is all part of a nightmare-inducing scenario where the hunter is an obvious target.And slowly the quest for little Rowan plunges below the tip of the iceberg, and we get a first answer on why a school lesson would talk about phallic symbols, why young people would dance naked around a fire, or others indulge with the kind of interplays you're more likely to find in a Swedish skin flick... even poor Howie is tantalized by the beautiful Britt Eckland who calls him to her room in a scene that is cleverly edited with shots on Howie praying Jesus to keep him strong. And so what could have been a sexploitation excuse turns out to be a character-establishing moment imposing Howie as a firm Christian. And so we get to the core of the film, an opposition of beliefs between the Christian man and the pagan villagers who believe in old Celtic legends, offering offrandes to Gods or sacrifices. Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee) plays a sort of grand guru of this sect and doesn't seem at all concerned by these beliefs that were restored by his ancestor, Lee is certainly given one of his best roles as the faux-affably long-haired aristocrat who's too cordial not to be the Big Bad of the film.And as Howie gets closer to May Day and understands the prospects of sacrifices for a better harvest, he reassembles the pieces of the puzzle and understand the macabre implication of Rowan's disappearance. At that point where no specific horror moment was shown, the film took me back to my worst memories, one including a TV program against vaccine where a little boy was lost in a medina and creepy masks representing diseases kept stalking him, a nightmarish vision that the film reminded me of. I have a problem with masks and the whole festival was quite a difficult sight to watch with so many close-ups but even that was just an appetizer compared to the real terror that was awaiting us, the one that gave its true meaning to the title.And while I was processing the film in my head, I realized there was something twisted and deeply cynical that didn't surprise me coming from the author of \"Frenzy\" or \"Sleuth\", the fact that if you switch the perspective and start watching the film from their own perspective and accept their paganism as a set of beliefs, then no matter how amoral they are, there's an area where the ending can be seen as a happy one where they accomplished a mission. And unless I'm wrong it's one of the rare instances where the ending is indeed 'happy' if you consider the bad guys' perspective.",

The sexy daughter of the local Innkeeper, Willow Britt Ekland) tries to seduce Howie who is a devout Christian.

Howie begins to suspect that the girl has been murdered. He manages to find her grave only to discover that a rabbit has been placed in her coffin. He goes to the Office of Records where the librarian (Ingrid Pitt) reluctantly shows that no death certificate for the girl exists.Along the way, Howie is exposed to the islander's odd rites and ceremonies. He deduces that they are all part of a pagan cult. Ceremonies are planned for May Day to offer sacrifices to their false gods to ensure a better crop season the next year. During a ceremonial march led by Lord Summerisle (in yet another horrendous wig) Howie dressed in a ceremonial costume, sees the young girl for whom he has been searching and tries to rescue her.Emerging from a cave, Howie is met by Lord Summerisle , Miss Rose, Willow and others.

            "content": "Having seen this film years ago, but only remembering a rather dull and simplistic movie with a stunning ending, I have been curious over the years to hear of people who regard it as a classic. I borrowed a copy from my son, then settled down to see what the fuss was about. The opening sequence really sets the scene for what is about to unfold - a very tedious solo flight to the island. This sequence does nothing except to provide a background for the opening credits. It's slow, boring and meaningless. The film starts when the plane lands at the island and Woodward's character begins to interact coldly with the islanders. Yes, he is sure of his convictions and his authority, even though he is often told that he is not the authority he believes himself to be. But I don't care. I don't care for his personality, nor his assumed authority, nor the simplistic approach Shaffer and Hardy have adopted to this symbol of blinkered Christian religion. I don't care for the clumsy speeches about religion, belief and morality - they never come over as natural dialogue , but as bits of cheap philosophy inserted baldly into the script. The brooding atmosphere of a \"reasoned\" man against a secretive and primitive community is present, but never fully developed. As the viewer I'm not sure who it is I'm identifying with - and that may be part of the film's appeal for many, but for me it leaves an emotional gap for which the cheap philosophy never fully fills. The shock of the first musical number, when the pub bursts into a bawdy song about the landlord's daughter is accidental amusing rather than skillfully handled. The erotic scenes outside the pub are odd, daft and laughable. When these are followed by the landlord's daughter's attempt to seduce the dour policeman by dancing naked in the next room - a room into which he cannot see - the film really starts to fall apart. The landlord's character is so badly Hammer horror funny that he can be spotted in many a horror film spoof. Yes, I can see people watching this to laugh at the ineptitude of it all. The sweet shop owner pops a frog into the mouth of her daughter to cure a bad throat, then asks the policeman if she can help him, to which he storms out shouting \"No, I doubt it, seeing you're all raving mad!\" Yes. A few drinks and a few friends and this film becomes an outrageous comedy. Wait until you see Christopher Lee! He gives a very assured performance - indubitably his best - it's just a shame that his blow dried hair and paedophile  manner undermines everything he says and does. The plotline is simplistic - a plod toward the discovery of why the policeman has been called to the island. It provides little side interest, little meaningful character interaction, simply a slow trudge toward the inevitable climax. There are no real people in this story. No real life. No ideas worth paying attention to. And no emotion. All this film has is a dramatic closing sequence. If you want to see the main point of the film - read a quick plot summary, then simply watch the ending. The rest of it is just too daft to take seriously.",

            "content": "I actually feel rattled after having watched this movie. I'm barely affected by most horrors and even though this isn't really a horror, it was incredibly disturbing. I found it hilariously weird and yet very engaging for the first three quarters but the last parts left me speechless. There are images which will be ingrained in my mind for the rest of my life. Like many great movies, it leaves you thinking for a long time afterwards. I'm going back over the movie in my mind, piecing things together. I see many of the scenes and words in a different light now. They exist in a deeper context now that I understand the full story.The Irish music is very gorgeous but also unsettling. You sense something is a bit off from right near the beginning. A bit like A Clockwork Orange, the music jars with the tone and events of the film in a way that makes it far more sinister than if we had dark, moody music.I'm reminded of the Joker in terms of the level of planning and control demonstrated here. It's impressive but psychotic. The Wicker Man is also very similar to Rosemary's Baby in the amount of isolation and confusion the main character feels. They don't feel supported and the people they meet are acting strange or indifferent to the point that they may begin to question their own sanity.Another theme which is present is the casual indifference to another person's pain to the point where laughter and joy can be enjoyed regardless. We can often understand why someone would commit a crime out of jealousy or rage or passion, but when they are gleefully ignorant of a person's suffering, when they show no empathy at all, we suspect pure evil.At first, the policeman's religious beliefs seem irrelevant and distracting. What matters is the difference between right and wrong, to simply be a decent human being and part of a healthy society. But over time we find that his religion is just a strong part of who he his; an atheist would probably have a similar reaction to what he sees but simply word their objections differently. Jesus may be irrelevant to exactly what's happening, but for him, the most direct way to express his disgust and disapproval is to turn to the words and ways of Christianity.Christopher Lee is extremely charismatic and commanding. He's tall and has a deep voice but also emanates a gentleness or kindness. He seems to emphasise almost every word he speaks. It sounds as though he sincerely believes everything he says. He could surely be extremely persuasive if he wanted to be. Britt Ekland seems to be a nymphomaniac, I'm not sure. She is very sexy and tries to tempt the main character. Even though she appears young and innocent and her sexuality makes her alive and human, the policeman still finds her untrustworthy and doesn't feel comfortable with her.Many of the other characters are suitably but subtly crazy (or seem that way). It's often annoying in murder-mysteries where every character is a suspect and acts overly suspiciously and then the actual culprit is some random person and the explanation is stupid. Here, the way the locals behave adds to the policeman's stress and isolation - he doesn't understand their culture or lifestyle which just exacerbates his difficulty in solving the crime he's investigating.I highly recommend The Wicker Man as it's very unique, has a strange and mysterious mood and is very thought-provoking and memorable by the end.",

Anthony Shaffer (One of my all time favorite writers) just makes it work, with help of course from the wonderful actors and director.Although not mentioned on the IMDb genre list, I consider this movie to be partly... well, a musical.

As this movie was out before my time I wasn't really aware of it until the mid 90's when I read an article in a film magazine about the best horror films of all time and this one was placed quite high at number 3 or 4 so I decided to ask my dad about it. He went on to tell me that it was one of the greatest films of all time and that I have to see it as it is really really good. My mother overheard this conversation and told me to not bother as it sucked. I decided my dad would be right on this occasion as he had introduced me to many other great horror movies such as Halloween, Friday the 13th, Psycho and many others. After spending a few days trawling around video shops (this was before DVDs) I eventually found an old copy in a second hand shop and bought it and watched it. As soon as it finished I put it in the bin and had a row with my dad over his crap judgement and told my mother I would never not believe her again as this movie is just an absolute awful piece of junk which is just over-hyped and overrated and it isn't even a horror film! I know the masses will disagree with me but I don't really care as I hated it all and actually preferred the Nicolas Cage remake which was just as bad but at least it had some horror elements to it!",

            "content": "On its surface \"The Wicker Man\" is about a police officer who is investigating the disappearance of a girl from a small island community. He meets nothing but resistance and opposition from the village as they are not very interested in outsiders and are also preparing for their big May Day celebration and would rather he not be around for it.As he learns more our police officer is apalled to find out that the community is a sort of revival village for paganism and the many songs he hears, interactions he has, and confusions he endures revolve around the culture shock of being in a world of people who don't think the way you do.This subtext is the most interesting aspect of the film to me. The way that witchcraft, paganism, and humanism are expressed is in many ways similar to the way a person who is Christian might feel in a community of all Buddhists or a Muslim might feel in a community of all Atheists.At first, it seems that while there may be differences in many areas, on the whole they should be able to get along. It is only after a considered screw-down into the details that it becomes apparent that they have intractable differences, not just surface ones.I don't know how much of this is intentional but it was the main thing I was feeling all the way through the film. Until the final facade is dropped and the heinousness of their communal intentions are revealed, there doesn't seem to be any reason that the police should care at all about what they are doing. They aren't hurting anyone and while their beliefs might make some roll their eyes, the same could be said of any religion or philosophy.It isn't until it is revealed that they have violent intentions beneath it all that all the awkward feelings and confusion that had permeated the film coalesce into the cruel scheme in which Sgt. Howie had been an unwitting pawn.It is a film about self delusion, communal story, and appearance vs substance. It's about knowing and how we know, fear of those who are different, and the limits of personal authority and autonomy.Strangely, I find it to be a strongly conservative film as many of the issues brought up from below the surface are typically fears of isolationists and fearful communities who are unsure of their ability to withstand cultural change or difference. Unfortunately that is also exactly the kind of person who typically would not watch this movie because of the paganism that is depicted within it. I do think there would be great value in it for those sorts of people though, if they could find a way to see beneath the imagery used and realize how much they have in common with the pagans in this film and also with Sgt Howie.Movies like this are not valuable because they are so intense (although it is) or because they portray us exactly as we see ourselves. The value blow the surface of this film is that the characters are so different from us that we are able to insert ourselves and our own issues beneath the metaphors the film maker is employing.It is precisely because the extreme to which this community takes their belief is further than I would go that makes me ask questions of myself and how far I would take certain beliefs especially when they run up against another.It is a warning of how manipulative, conniving, and cold we can be toward \"the other\" within our communities and an exhortation not to let ourselves go that way. Caring only for ourselves and our own small niches, silos, and facebook groups carries with it the huge danger of misunderstanding, not trying to understand, or not even not listening to people who aren't in our circle of confirming friendships even those who show up on our shores for altogether good or righteous intentions.",

My roommate and I sat down and began watching it one night when we probably should have been doing more important stuff. When the \"Corn Rigs\" music kicked in, we just looked at each other, puzzled. We had no idea what we were in for. It's not really a traditional horror movie. It's more like a horror musical. But don't let that fool you, it's the creepiest movie I've ever seen. It's so bizarre. I wasn't sure if I liked it after the first time, so I decided a second viewing was definitely needed. And I was right. The second time you watch it, you realize the intricate web that the islanders spin Sgt. Howie into. The amount of frustration he goes through searching for the girl is unnerving, I would have gave up or gone mad. And the great foreshadowing done with the connection between the bug and Howie can be seen the second time around. Their fates are the same. Both Lee and Woodward are great. Lee is just awesome as Lord Summerisle. And Woodward is an excellent actor, you can see the desperate look in his eye at the end. And you feel so sorry for the poor b*****d. The Wicker Man itself is an extremely impressive sight to behold. One of my favorite images in horror history is that of the burning Wicker Man and the islanders happily singing, drowning out Sgt. Howie's terrified screams. The Wicker Man is an unforgettable classic. Once again thanks goes to Anchor Bay for the re-release.",

I have no problem when they try to better the lives of people, but giving up your being to a stranger is a high price. The British cop is a first class buffoon. He would still be if he had come upon a less dramatic society. He jumps to conclusions, judges everyone, investigates a murder that never happened. He trashes people's houses, tilting at windmills. I know that ultimately what is done to him seems over the top, but people like him would do it to others if they had the chance. I think of the religious right in the U. S.

            "content": "Long before he wowed audiences as Robert McCall in the cult classic \"The Equalizer\", British actor Edward Woodward starred in one of the most misunderstood, cult classics in cinematic history \"The Wicker Man\". Though it's been long identified as a horror film, it's not the conventional kind of horror. There's no gratuitous violence, there's no jump scare close-ups, no bloody gore, there's only one killing and nothing that's going to scare you off of your chair when things go bump in the night. \"The Wicker Man\" takes it's horror to a more subtle level where it's unique, disturbing, unsettling and even at times puzzling. It's the kind of movie you have to see to believe and even the viewers will be restless after what they saw once the credits roll.The movie focuses on devouted Christian police Sgt. Howie (Woodward) who was assigned to investigate the disappearance of a missing girl named Rowan Morrison. His investigation leads him to a remote Scottish island called Summerisle where he meets up with the occupants on the island. However, the inhabitants abide by strange rituals that are alien to the standards that we live in. Though what might seem normal to them might not coincide with our rules and obligations. The sad part is that Sgt. Howie is learning this the hard way. While trying so desperately in getting a lead to finding this missing child, the villagers are not very cooperative and even claim that they never heard of this girl. Even her own mother seems to not be very compliant in his investigation, which is strange because she should by all accounts be most concerned for her daughter.The more passive the inhabitants are, the more frustrated Sgt. Howie becomes. And it's not just by the inhabitants who constantly dismiss, it's their unconventional way of living that also is testing his patience. The occupants on this island bask into a nonconformist way of life by engaging in pagan traditions and while Sgt. Howie seems strict on his Christian ways of life the culture clash becomes the focal point of this movie. The horror from the movie is from the uncomfortable and unpredictable practices that neither Howie or the audience can not fully come to grips with. And it's misunderstandings like this that make the atmosphere around you scary. What we can't decipher can give you feelings of frustration, anger, fear and disgust and when \"normal\" people enter new settings that defies their standards, it can leave a psychological scar on you that you might never fully recover from.When Howie finally meets the leader of the island, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee) the chief agrees to help him find the missing girl, even though he still takes the police officer for an unpleasant ride leaving Howie more uncomfortable. And the more mind games that's being played on, the madder Howie is becoming which eventually leads him on more dangerous paths than even he or we could've imagined.Even though his acting career spanned almost seven decades and over 300 films, Christopher Lee has often said that \"The Wicker Man\" was clearly the best film that he starred in. In fact he actually loved it so much, he starred in it for free. Lee along with Woodward, and other key supporting performers including Diane Cilento, Britt Eklund and Ingrid Pitt they had succeeded in keeping everything authentic while making it feel surreal. The set-up is perfect thanks to the brilliant script by Anthony Shaffer who's ideas were inspired by the novel \"Ritual\" by David Pinner. The alienation and isolation of being alone in a place where you're not accustomed to can be very tense and the worst part is no one is really there to help you.Aside from the unnerving vibes, \"The Wicker Man\" has a world that filled with curiousity and intrigue. Where else would you find a place that features one of the most erotic and seductive scenes in the history of cinema where love isn't just a pleasure it's a way of life. Aside from that the folk music presented here comes off catchy and provocative and as an added bonus the music is not a collection of obscure Celtic folk songs dating back thousands of years. Instead the songs were composed by Paul Giovanni which may be original but convincing enough to making us think these songs are compositions ressurected from the ashes.It was a shame that after the film's release, the movie never fully got the respect that it deserved. Many purists were turned off by the myriad of sexual innuendo. It was also heartbreaking that this badly misunderstood movie was criticized by the way it presented itself with those claiming it had an anti-religious message subliminally hidden in the narrative.Such an example of anti-Christian feelings the masses had was that as Sgt. Howie was being sacrificed by the occupants on the island, he starts yelling verses from the Bible while Summerisle and the islander inhabitants look on dancing and frolicing. I think those reviewers had Shaffer's script badly misconstrued. Sure I agree that Howie is not a likable character. He's conceited, judgmental and is kind of dismissive in his feelings. But he was assigned to the island in serch of finding a missing girl who ended up meeting the people he would soon regret. It's the occupants on the island that are the villains, who set up Howie all this time to begin with. When Howie dies, he won't go down quietly, he'll go down a hero in his world in the name of the shameless people who brought him here in the first place. Not to say that his views are better, but his pride and his morals reign supreme.",

I loved the strong performances, and unlike the reviewer at the Wicker Man page, I also enjoyed the music and the atmosphere of the film. Christopher Lee gives one of the best performances of his career as Lord Summerisle; the Wicker Man was voted one of the top one hundred most important British films of all time for many a good  reason.  It broke the mold for horror films and it's like hasn't been made since.  I love the \"thinking man's horror film\" gestalt that this film has and the way that things gradually unfold, leading us inexorably towards an emotionally charged, stunning climax.  The seventies kitsch that the site reviewer laments adds immeasurably to the atmosphere of the film for me; an atmosphere which is very earthy and enjoyable.  The characters are very human and vibrant, and all of them are likeable, which is strange all things considered.  I really did like Lord Summerisle.  I liked the sincereity of all the villagers.  This \"likeability\" adds a profound depth to one's sense of shock and horror at the end of the film.  All in all, I must respectfully and quite vigorously disagree with the negative review bestowed upon the Wicker Man at it's page.  I felt compelled to rebut it and to point out that not only did I love this movie, (indeed, it's one of my all time favorites; right up there with Dr. Strangelove and Lawrence Of Arabia), but I enjoyed the music so much that I'm going to buy the CD as soon as it comes out this month!

This is part of the brilliance of the film. The music is beguiling - perhaps the best soundtrack in any film. The acting is utterly convincing. The rites are performed with such belief and passion. The final ideological duel between Howie as he sings a psalm in opposition to the locals as they swing back and forth whilst singing \"Summer is A'Coming In\" as the wicker-man burns is perhaps the most striking and thought-provoking conclusion to any film.

Filled with a lot of bad Scottish folk songs (and I mean a lot of them), neo-Pagan mumbo-jumbo, lots of people with bad teeth and a hero who gets killed for trying to do the right thing, it just wasn't really scary or very interesting.",

            "content": "The Wicker Man is hardly a horror film in the traditional sense of what most people would expect to fit that definition. It is however a terrifically unsettling experience with a stunning conclusion. The film is deeply shrouded in the style and attitudes of pop culture that were prevalent at the time it was made. So much so that much of the music sounds like Simon and Garfunkel type stuff, and the hippie attitudes of the late sixties seem to have been warped to fit pagan beliefs, or vice versa. But whatever the motivations, the finished product is definitely something to behold.Edward Woodward plays a sergeant from Scottland Yard summoned to investigate the apparent murder of a young girl in an isolated island community. Woodward has not even set foot on the land at Summerisle before he suspects the locals have something to hide. Though they are not outwardly hostile, they are hardly helpful with his search. And each step he takes on the island seems to reveal more and more strange behavior. The inhabitants are openly pagan in belief and practice. They make no bones about the fact that Christianity has long since vanished from the island, and now some kind of new-age translation of their old ways has taken roots. Christopher Lee plays the man in charge of it all in a role so delicious, he did it for free.Strange behavior aside, it is obvious that nobody plans on helping Woodward find out what happened to the little girl. At least that's what he's led to believe! Woodward is eventually able to piece together some clues leading him to believe she is still alive and will be sacrificed in a May-day ritual of some sort. He then sets out to search the island from one corner to the next to find the girl and get her out in time. That's his plan, anyway.....To read further would be a grave error if you have not seen this film. The ending was a big surprise for myself, and thankfully I did not read enough about the film to get any hint of the conclusion..... Well, to sum things up, Woodward learns that HE is really the one who will be sacrificed! The girl was never missing. She was just a means of getting Woodward out to the island to be sacrificed. He being a virgin, a servant of the king, and a couple more reasons that I cannot recollect, made him the perfect candidate these pagans were looking for. Since their crops had recently failed, they believed only a proper adult human sacrifice would appease their sun god and bring the crops back. Woodward is placed inside a giant man made of wood, and burned alive along with several animals. The scene was stunning, and for moment I was sure they'd either cop out and tell us it was all a big hoax, or someone or something would come along a save the day for Woodward. Though I felt very bad for his character, thankfully the film never copped out and filmed the ending we see.The Wicker Man is a very good film on many levels. The acting is very good from the main characters. Lee is always a treat, Britt Ekland is particularly stunning, and Woodward is top-drawer. He never really hit it that big in the US, and this is a shame. I've seen the guy in like three films, and he's really talented. Perfect for this policeman role. Breaker Morant is another fine one with him. The hippie music is a little odd, but somehow hypnotic so it ends up actually working. The story is not all that believable, and the final scene may not have been conceived properly in terms of blocking. Honestly, if I were in the cop's shoes, it would have taken one hell of a lot more than one guy to drag me into that contraption. I know, \"but where was he going to run to?\" Still, he would have resisted more than he did. Overall, I'd strongly recommend the film. And by all means try and avoid the remake. By all accounts it is terrible. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",

            "content": "A claustrophobic tension pervades this film from the first moment, when a devout Presbyterian policeman sets of on a journey to a remote Scottish island, to investigate the disappearance of a missing girl. He receives a frosty reception from the villagers upon arriving on the island. He also suspects them of stonewalling but is impotent to counter their response effectively. This dynamic sets a pattern for much of the film. Howie, played to perfection by Edward Woodward, is further disturbed to learn the islanders practice ancient pagan rituals, in stark contrast to his absolute devotion to the Christian faith. The more frightened he becomes, the more dogmatic his reactions, and the less he's able to see what is happening around him. His interplay with the charismatic community leader, played brilliantly by Christopher Lee, only adds to his distress in his search for answers. Howie correctly perceives that the pagan religion is being used by Summerisle as a form of social control, but is unable to counter Summerisle's challenges to his own religious beliefs.Symbolism is very important in this film. The meanings of various animals and shapes may baffle you when you first see the movie. If you can hang on till the final 20 minutes, everything becomes wonderfully and completely clear. It's well worth the wait. It's a superbly written and acted movie, that will leave the viewer with questions about society and life long after the final credits have rolled.",

And I'm not talking about the Pagans.Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward)a prudish Scottish Policeman, receives a complaint from a resident of Summerisle (a remote island somewhere off the coast of Scotland) about her missing daughter. This precipitates Howie's encounter with the islands \"quaint natives\", back country, rural folk, \"Pagani\", in Latin, and it's not long before the devout Christian copper discovers that they have abandoned Christianity and become exactly that. As the community's leader (a delightful Christopher Lee) calmly explains, Jesus \"Had his shot, and, in modern parlance. . .blew it\" Lee's ancestor rejuvenated the desperate island's economic prospects by introducing a new and hardy strain of fruit, and knowingly attributed his success to his worship of the old Celtic deities who were once reverenced in Britain before the imposition (and eventual adoption) of Christianity. And now, the islanders have not only reclaimed their ancestor's old beliefs, but in the process have \"freed\" themselves from conventional Judaeo-Christian morality, much to Howie's consternation. \"You teach them what? False Medicine! False Religion?\" However, to these islanders, the Celtic Gods are very real, and they are as sincere and unwavering in their beliefs as Howie is in his. The policeman's pursuit of the missing child, affirming repeatedly along the way his complete faith in the right of Christian dogma and morality, will lead him and us to a harrowing end on a windswept cliff at sunset, where we finally realize, too late, that what we might regard as unquestionably true just might not be somewhere else. . . .and that is far more terrifying than any monster could ever be. This film should take on increasing importance in this day and age, where, everyday, we are bombarded with news reports, and in some cases real events in our own backyard involving people whose unwavering belief that what they believe in and do in the name of that belief is right and good end up inflicting irreparable harm on others. And I'm not just talking about suicide bombers. The joy, the utter suety , with which the people of Summerisle go about their May Day festivities at the expense of Seargent Howie is truly one of the most effective pieces of cinema I have seen, and should be a stark warning to any of us, on either side of the fence, who, even in the back of our minds, believe that we alone truly have \"it\" right.

            "content": "\"The Wicker Man\" is a great movie. Not only is it an original subversion of the genre conventions of typical \"horror\" films, but it also subtly incorporates themes much wider than the narrative. The film starts of as Detective Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) arrives on a picturesque Scottish island after receiving an anonymous letter telling him that a young girl has been missing for months, so he sets out to find her. But he finds the locals of Summerisle to be uncooperative, and their behaviour - particularly their neopagan religious practices - bizarre and sinister. The film seems to have sparked debate between Pagans and Christians on the board as to which theology the film is advocating, or whether it is scornful to both, but I don't think this really features. \"The Wicker Man\" is a film with no apparent political or strong ideological agenda, and as such it raises more questions than answers. The films rejection of genre markers adds to the neutrality of the way it treats its subjects. This could be in reference to Pagan tradition itself. Whereas Christian teaching suppresses the parts of human nature it finds dark or impure, the sort of beliefs depicted embrace their animalism and celebrate everything that is innate to human beings in their role as part of nature. Sounds fair enough, but in the ending scenes when the animalism of humanity, or \"nature\", is laid bare in all its brutality, the result is disturbing and abhorrent. Despite the moral neutrality of human nature, in most people there is a desire for purity and goodness. Part of the irony of the human psyche is that there are instincts and behaviours clearly \"natural\" - things we were born to be - that are too dark to be embraced or even really accepted by sane people. Woodward's character can be seen as somewhat dour and closed minded, but in the end his adversaries prove his suspicions correct, and the islanders simply come across as sick...forks. In a similar vein, the film plays up the similarities between Christianity and Paganism, yet never quite derides or exalts the concept of Faith. It is faith that seals Detective Howie's fate, but at the same time faith that lends it some dignity. The contrast is enhanced by the setting of the film. Summerisle is at first glance a normal village, and its inhabitants look normal. But the details build up a dreamlike surrealism and confusion - on Summerisle, everyday concepts such as school, church, medicine, childhood and social interaction are subverted from mundane to glaringly abnormal. This gives a disconcerting sense of what it might have felt like when the first Christians set foot in Pagan Britain, and of the subjective nature of normality. By placing a conventional man as the outsider to a strange community, the film creates an empathy with the outsider, contravening the usual character \"roles\" in Horror. \"The Wicker Man\" is in no way typical of a horror movie, not even the murder scene. The fact that such a horrifying act takes place in broad daylight, in the open, by a whole community, and that their emotional reaction to the situation's brutality is so indifferent not only underscores that what's \"natural\" isn't always \"right\" but also triggers questions about the horrors that become accepted in societies. There is nothing like \"The Wicker Man\". For the most part, it is a strange fusion of crime thriller, surreal comedy, musical and (at the climax) epic, and it somehow pulls it off; the overall feel is similar to a disturbing dream that stays with you all through the next day after you wake up. Its weirdness is what makes it work :)",

            "content": "Robin Hardy has created a very different kind of horror. The Wicker Man is not a slasher, an exploitation flick, a ghost story, a werewolf film, etc. It is a blend of horror, mystery and religion with a touch of drama. After watching I thought it best to break the plot in two halves. The first half plays like a mystery, Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) is sent a mysterious letter asking him to locate a missing girl, Rowan Morrison, who lives on Summerisle. Throughout the first 50 minutes we are lead to believe many things about this girl but which ones are the truth? This is what makes The Wicker Man such a brilliant movie. The director never really settles on any idea or mood and as we see religious rituals and meet Lord Summerisle (an amazing performance by Christopher Lee) we know there is something quite sinister under it all.From the 50 minute mark, though, the movie slowly grows into a full blown horror which still manages to shock this very day. The great thing about it though, is the fact that Hardy decides to draw it out so our suspense levels are at the point where we are gripping the couch, just awaiting what is to be inevitable. And when it comes it hits like a hammer, it is shocking but done in a way so that it is not cheap or exploitive.The Wicker Man is horror at its best. There is no violence, no cheap shocks, bad acting or predictable music. Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee are both excellent in their roles. One a devout Christian cop and one the head of a Pagan community. An enchanting soundtrack is used marvelously in The Wicker Man which seems to lure the viewer into a false sense of security. Despite the thought of sinister goings on in the community , there is a certain light, playful feeling that is brought about by the elegant soundtrack making it quite hard to actually believe there any evil events occurring.Although this is not pure horror, it is easily one of the greatest (horror) movies of all time. Well-acted, great soundtrack, captivating direction and the best ending to a film ever put onto celluloid.5/5",

Unlike the first two films, Robin Hardy's debut was originally mishandled and overlooked, only belatedly recognised as a brilliant original years later. Christopher Lee still refers to it as his greatest film role, while the exceptional score continues to inspire new generations of folk new wavers. Brimming with eroticism, haunted atmospherics and authentic pagan idolatry, it retains its bewitching power all the way to the horrifying finale.The other thing about the Wicker Man, is Britt Ekland. For a great number of young, British hetero men growing up in the 1980s, forbidden fruit came courtesy of two very impressionable, unforgettable sources: the well-bookmarked novels of horror writer James Herbert, with their unique descriptions of ritual and romance (all \"secret softnesses\" and \"moist forests\" being plunged into) - and Ekland in The Wicker Man.For those whose previous experience of girls cavorting round their bedrooms was confined to watching their sisters wig out to Altered Images, the vision of innkeeper's daughter Willow McGregor getting her kit off, shaking her jelly, and hammering lustily on the dividing walls, will have seared itself like an atomic-flash on the eyeballs for eternity. So potent and universal is this pagan rite of passage that acclaimed TV writer Steven Moffat once milked the phenomenon for an entire episode of 'Coupling'.",

            "content": "The 2-disc DVD edition of the 1973 British cult classic THE WICKER MAN (TWM) includes the 88-minute cut that played in theaters and the restored 99-minute version. If you're expecting a high body count, slam-bang action, and fast-paced editing of the sort spoofed so brilliantly in HOT FUZZ (also featuring TWM star Edward Woodward), you may feel impatient, but chill out and pay attention, and you just might be glad you did.After a puckish opening title screen thanking the people of Summerisle \"for this privileged insight into their religious practices and for their generous co-operation in the making of this film,\" Sir Anthony Shaffer's screenplay tells the story of Police Sgt. Neil Howie (Woodward) investigating an anonymous tip begging him to find Rowan Morrison (Geraldine Cowper), a 12-year-old girl living \u0097 or is she? \u0097 on Summerisle, an island off Scotland that's renowned for its apples and other produce. A staunch Catholic and by-the-book police officer, Sgt. Howie's expectations are confounded from square one. When he arrives via seaplane for an overnight stay, expecting to be served fresh Summerisle apples and veggies, he's surprised to be handed a plateful of turquoise-hued beans from a can. Indeed, all the islanders seem to be eating nothing but canned produce as Summerisle's apple crates lie empty. But that's nothing compared to Howie's outrage as his investigation reveals that the islanders, led by Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee in a performance brimming with urbane mischief and menace) are all free-thinking, free-loving pagans.The culture clash between Howie and the Summerislers lends TWM as much wry humor as mystery and suspense. Things only get weirder, creepier, and often, more titillating as everyone he meets stymies his investigation into Rowan's disappearance. Everybody from Rowan's family to her teacher, Miss Rose (Diane Cilento), to Lord Summerisle himself initially deny that Rowan even exists, then claim she's dead, then\u0085well, with the strange excuses and even stranger rituals on Summerisle, the determined Howie has his work cut out for him as the film reaches its shocking climax.Over the years, fans and critics alike have tried to stuff TWM into the horror and fantasy categories, perhaps because the cast includes Lee and fellow genre movie veterans Ingrid Pitt and Britt Ekland. However, anyone anticipating traditional monsters, copious bloodletting, or F/X-oriented frights will be disappointed; that's not what TWM is about. For all its suspense, we never see anything supernatural happen; even the weirdest things can be explained by real-world circumstances. There's a bit of low-key gore, but by and large, the monstrousness is of a purely human variety, the evil and intolerance that lives and lurks quietly like a sleeper cell in people's hearts, minds, and belief systems. To me, that's scarier than any supernatural creature, because it hits closer to home.TWM creates an air of unworldly unease, of events beyond what we can see and hear, keeping us guessing to the end. Between the uniformly fine acting, Robin Hardy's skillful direction, and Shaffer's slyly sinister script, TWM is a great example of how you don't need endless gore and sadism to chill an audience to the bone, just suspense crafted from atmospheric direction, a stellar cast, and foreboding arising from the enigmatic circumstances, character development, and a location whose beauty hides its treachery.Shaffer's script plays fair, trusting the audience to keep up with its skillful combination of wit, mystery, and dread. The characterizations are fascinating throughout, particularly with Sgt. Howie and Lord Summerisle. My husband and I have joked more than once that, in the end, what really killed poor, well-meaning, stalwart Sgt. Howie was the stick up his ass. Even before he realized he'd been tricked, that he and not Rowan was the intended blood sacrifice that the Summerislers hoped would appease their ancient gods and jump-start their crops, Howie showed nothing but hostility and intolerance towards the placid islanders' religious practices. If he'd only loosened up and let himself be seduced by the bewitching Willow McGregor, he'd have lost his virginity, rendered himself useless as a blood sacrifice, and saved his own life. God and Howie's fianc\u00e9e would've forgiven him, I'm sure. :-) I'll admit that as much as I love the film as is, there's always a part of me that wishes they could have had one last shot set one year later, showing whether Summerisle had their hoped-for bumper crop or, perhaps, showing Lord Summerisle himself being dragged into the wicker man and set aflame after another disastrous barren year. Yeah, I guess it's better to keep the audience guessing, but closure has its merits, too.Paul Giovanni's haunting music, with traditional Celtic songs woven throughout, is practically another character in the film, by turns erotic and beautiful, bawdy and joyful, fitting the film's tone perfectly. No wonder Eli Roth used \"Willow's Song\" in a key scene in HOSTEL! As Willow, Ekland looks luscious and does a decent Scots accent, though her singing is dubbed by Annie Ross, and some shots of her backside were done by a body double. But why quibble when there's such a powerful erotic charge to watching Willow drive poor Howie nearly mad by, well, making love to the wall separating her room from his? Say what you will about pagans, they know how to party! :-) The DVD's extras include the restored version and a terrific commentary track on Disc 2, with moderator Mark Kermode interviewing Hardy, Lee, and Woodward, exchanging entertaining stories about the tricks involved in making a low-budget, tight-scheduled movie while studio British Lion was on the slippery slope to bankruptcy. Disc 1's excellent documentary featurette, The Wicker Man Enigma, includes interviews with Woodward, Lee, Pitt, Hardy, Shaffer, and Roger Corman, as well as the jaw-dropping story of the idiots who thought they were putting the TWM negative in a vault but instead put it in a waste pile that was buried under England's M3 highway!",

It's a feast to our eyes and senses first of all, even if we all deny it.Then it comes the metaphor of a judgemental society turned against itself. The police man is the whole film judging what he is seeing, because it's different from what he knows - the prejudice all around yes.and then, when he feels the risk he starts to talk to Jesus, even if before that we didn't find him THAT Christian. It works pretty well.So the film has that message, even though it works more as a bizarre ritualistic horror film, or whatever it may be called. And it's fun, the characters are somehow wicked. The only criticism for me is how the things are shown to the viewer. Of course that WE are the policeman, but we feel him like a stone coming to one event to the other. Maybe i saw the shorter version, i believe the longer cut would reveal more about the character. The guy is not explored as he should be.So we have a good film, very attractive visually, questioning our own beliefs, while is entertaining us. A great classic i may say, with a top notch ending that is basically making fun of us. A lot.",

            "content": "Perhaps the cult film to end all cult films -- due to the fact that it is a cult film that concerns, well, a cult -- \"The Wicker Man\" is a highly influential and surreal story about a devout Christian police officer sent to a remote island in Scotland in search of a missing girl. Things go awry, as not only does the hedonistic way of life these islanders enjoy clash with that of the officer's beliefs, but also because no one will tell him the truth about what happened to or what will become of the missing child.Filmed entirely on location in Scotland, \"The Wicker Man\" has a sense of authenticity that is driven home by a pair of knock-out performances in Edward Woodward and the legendary Christopher Lee. Woodward, as the would-be hero, keeps things grounded even at their most bizarre and ridiculous. His grim facial expressions and looks of horror say it all. Lee, on the other side of the coin, is playing the enigmatic leader of the cult, and is certainly in his prime in one of his finest roles. Elsewhere, the acting ranges from questionable to non-existent, but because these two men deliver in spades, the film rarely suffers.Granted, there's a wealth of musical numbers that make things a bit awkward, but maybe that's the intention. Afterall, most of the film seems aimed at catching its audience off-guard and creeping it out, and to that end, it certainly succeeds. Even nearly forty years later, it still manages to at least make you uncomfortable one way or another, whether it's through the unassuming scenery, the outrageous costumes and rituals or simply in its shocking ending that will certainly leave you with a little extra left to chew on. \"The Wicker Man\" is quite simply a unique horror film that is must-see material. Whatever you feel after watching the film, you'll certainly be affected one way or another, and that's the film's ultimate brilliance.",

            "content": "Last night I watched director Robin Hardy's 1973 movie The Wicker Man and was completely stunned by what was on the screen. I have heard good things about this movie, and decided to watch it on demand. The music is one of the many things that makes this movie work, along with decent performances by the actors involved, and disturbing scenes that seemed torn from an ancient past.A police officer named Sargeant Hardy (Edward Woodward) comes to an island village in search of a missing girl. The locals deny she ever existed and don't offer him much help. They aren't hostile per say, but you get a sense that something just isn't right about them. After discovering some strange rituals that go on which involve Pagan religion, Howie becomes suspicious and, being a Christian man an all, appalled and disgusted by what is going on. He continues his search for the missing girl using his authority as an officer of the law. He has an idea about what's happening, but never truly suspects where this trip to the island is really going to lead him until the shocking ending which I will not reveal.The folk music that opens the movie was perfect for a film such as this one. It fits in with everything that goes on. There are dance numbers as well, and one in particular involves Britt Ekland who plays Willow. This scene, which is rather unusual but surprising for a movie out in 1973, will become important to the plot of the film and the shocking journey that follows at the end.The scenery is eerie and though this film is not scary, well not until the shocking conclusion anyway, it is more of a mood piece that pulls you in and creeps you out instead. The atmosphere is creepy as well, and Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle is perfect in his role. He never appears terrifying, but you easily sense that there is a reason to be frightened of this man.The film is the director's take on two distinct and different religions. Edward Woodward as the passionate Christian fits the mold well. His distaste for Pagan religion feels completely genuine, not like that of a man just playing a part. You feel his anger and disgust. The island's inhabitants also fit their beliefs as well. They never appear to be actors, but a real society that might easily exist somewhere in the world.Weird, creepy, shocking. These words all fit as descriptions of The Wicker Man. The film is neither gory nor terrifying, but it will make your blood run cold anyway. Highly recommended. I've never seen the remake, but this film is a definite must see.",

            "content": "'The Wicker Man' is - like 'Withnail & I', 'Get Carter' and 'Performance' - quite rightly hailed as a cult Brit classic. The simple fact that this obscure film has attracted well over 200 reviews on the IMDb website is testament to the enduring spell it has cast upon its admirers (either that or it is a testament to the IMDb's popularity). Christopher Lee acclaims it his finest screen performance but Edward Woodward (Sgt Howey) and Lindsey Kemp (the publican) steal the acting honours. And although Britt Ekland appears, her voice was dubbed over and a body double used for the nude scenes (much to her chagrin). Though one must honour screenwriter Anthony Shaffer ('Sleuth', 'Amadeus') and director Robin Hardy too.It's well worth tracking down the original uncut version because it helps establish Sgt Howey's character as a somewhat odd but thoroughly devout Christian. Quite rightly he is considered something of a prude, yet one cannot fault his decency and spiritual integrity. Indeed, this gives the story its backbone of credibility. The tenacious way in which he conducts his investigation whilst the inhabitants of Lord Summerisle's Island play with him like a spider caught in a web is testament to this. As viewers we sense that Howey is anything but paranoid and therein lies the true terror (paranoia being the delusion that 'everyone is out to get you'; clearly this is no delusion).The film possesses a discordant weird ambiance throughout and features a superbly horrific ending. The music perfectly underscores the mood, suggesting a dark Celtish folklore in which pagan rites dominate all spiritual belief. There are many brilliantly evocative images which linger on in the mind of the viewer, including the scene of the naked woman grieving on a tombstone (recalling the Mardi Gras trip scenes from 'Easy Rider'), the naked women jumping through the flames, the insect tied to a pin in a schoolgirl's desk, the inhabitants wearing animal masks, and of course, the final scene in which director Robin Hardy wonderfully juxtaposes the burning sacrificial pyre against the setting sun.According to historians, the lost edits from this were used as filling for a Buckinghamshire road improvement scheme, when boxes of unwanted film reels were crushed up to use as ballast. Even the current extra-length version we now enjoy only exists by accident, after the UK distributors sent US cult director Roger Corman their only fuller length copy, having cut the British version for various reasons. Luckily Corman was impressed with the film and had kept the only longer-length version safe, which is why we can now enjoy an extended, but alas by no means complete, version of this brilliant, brilliant masterpiece.",

Soon this devout Christian detective uncovers a secret society of modern pagans.Directed by Robin Hardy (The Fantasist) made an fascinating, eerie dark humor thriller with seemingly real local people and very memorable folk music. Woodward and Lee are excellent in the film. Perhaps not the horror movie that some people were expecting (Like i did).

Disc one has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an fine digitally remastered Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Disc one also includes 35 minutes documentary with the cast & crew, theatrical trailer and more.Disc two is the extended version that is pretty close to Hardy's intended cut.

            "content": "The great Christopher Lee, who agreed to appear in this film for free, is said to consider \"The Wicker Man\" of 1973 the greatest film he was ever part of. For good reasons, as this is one of the most unique and original cinematic masterpieces ever brought to screen and an absolute must-see for everybody interested in film. I will not try to discuss whether this is a Horror film or not. The unique greatness of \"The Wicker Man\" combines elements from a variety of genres, Horror, Thriller, Mystery, Fantasy, Drama, and even Musical, but it can not really be limited to one particular genre. \"The Wicker Man\" is one of the most essential films for any lover of Horror and Cult-Cinema to see for a variety of reasons. Firstly, this film profits from one of the greatest scripts ever written. The convoluted and fascinating story of \"The Wicker Man\" from the pen of Anthony Shaffner, who had previously written the screenplays to \"Sleuth\" (1972) and Alfred Hitchcock's \"Frenzy\" (also 1972) is based on David Pinner's novel \"Ritual\". Though I have never read the novel, I must say that Shaffner more than deserves to be called a genius for how he transferred it into one of the most intriguing scripts in film history.Scottish police sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) is called by an anonymous letter to investigate the disappearance of a young girl on the remote Scottish island Summerisle. Upon his arrival, nobody seems to have ever heard of the girl. The deeply religious Sergeant Howie, however, is shocked to find out that the residents of the island, above all the sophisticated but mysterious Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), are practicing a pagan customs and free sexuality...As said above, the ingenious script by Anthony Shaffner must be one of the most brilliant that was ever written. Robin Hardy's direction also deserves utmost praise, however. The beautiful Scottish landscapes are a wonderful setting for this fascinating film, the cinematography is brilliant, and, above all, the film provides one of the most unique scores. Beautiful Scottish folk songs go in hand with gripping suspense, surrealism and convoluted mystery. Another outstanding quality of \"The Wicker Man\" is the brilliant cast. Edward Woodward is excellent in the role of Sergeant Howie, who has little understanding for non-Christian beliefs. The character of Sergeant Howie is another brilliant aspect of the story. At first one does not really know whose side to be on - that of the dutiful but narrow-minded Sergeant, or that of the open-minded, but mysterious pagans. The incomparable Christopher Lee, one of the greatest actors ever in my opinion, delivers one of his greatest performances as the mysterious Lord Summerisle, another character which makes this film so brilliant and unique. The female cast includes Swedish beauty queen Britt Eckland as the innkeeper's seductive daughter Willow, Diane Cilento as the school teacher, and Ingrid Pitt, sexy leading woman of several Hammer Horror films, as a librarian. Actually, it must be said that all the performances are great here. Lee and Woodward, of course, range at the very top, and Britt Eckland is too beautiful to be true. All said, \"The Wicker Man\" has everything one could possibly desire in cinema, stunning suspense and genuine creepiness, complex mystery, delightfully bizarre weirdness, overwhelming settings and photography, brilliant performances and intriguing characters, beautiful and hypnotic music, and one of the most mesmerizing story lines ever in cinema. A remake was made in 2006, which I will never watch as the mere thought of it disgusts me. This 1973 original is one of the most unique, fascinating and compelling experiences a cineaste can have, one of the greatest British films of all-time and a masterpiece that no lover of cinema can afford to miss! The 100 minute director's cut is essential. 10/10",

I am so glad that this movie finally is getting the props it deserves, and if you are thinking of purchasing it, you have to get the Collector's Edition, which has about 12 minutes of original footage that is not only essential for the whole affect of the film, but drops some subtle hints as to what is actually going down.A 9/10 must see. 1 point deducted for some bad folk music, although you have to listen to the words of the songs, as they get more and more sinister as you go along.",

This is supposed to be the definitive \"restored\" version of this film?I also happen to have a mint condition 1988 Magnum Entertainment VHS copy of the \"uncut\" version which runs 101 minutes and my puzzlement deepens.Between the VHS and DVD versions I spot one or two variances between the insert shots. Case in point being the first insert of Rowan's photograph when it is received in the police station. In the VHS version it is a full-length view of the entire photo, while in the DVD version it is replaced by a jarringly out of place, very tight close-up of Rowan's face.Also, is the DVD version guilty of the infamous \"false letterbox?\" I have played the VHS and DVD side by side and am convinced that the DVD has taken a fullscreen print and simply masked the top and bottom of the image to create a widescreen image. This is based on the fact that the \"width\" of the VHS image is identical to that of the DVD, while the \"height\" of the DVD image clearly indicates that portions of the image have been masked.Notice how many times the tops of people's heads are trimmed throughout the film. Final proof for me came with the establishing shot of the Green Man pub sign, which in the DVD is not-so-neatly cut off top and bottom just at the borders of the sign, while in the 1988 VHS copy, we not only see the sign, but also so decorative metalwork above and bushes below it.All throughout the film there are countless examples where the composition of the frame suggests the masking of a fullscreen print rather than the transfer of a widescreen image.Can anyone else out there back me up on this?

            "content": "What makes a great horror film? It might seem a frivolous question, a near rhetorical one to which the answer \"a film which scares\" is obvious. Yet few would interpret The Wicker Man, the 1973 British cult classic, as particularly scary in the traditional sense. It is in the themes and ideas behind the film, however, that the element of horror is to be found. Like its American contemporaries The Exorcist and The Omen, The Wicker Man deals with that most effective of horror themes: religion.Having been anonymously alerted to the mysterious disappearance of a young girl from the remote Scottish island community of Summerisle, Sergeant Neil Howie encounters difficulties in his search for answers in the form of the obdurate islanders, who fervently deny the girl's existence.That a film so regularly ranked highly in horror \"best of\" lists can contain traces of a musical might seem perplexing, even contradictory, the mutual exclusivity of the genres surely set in stone. Much of The Wicker Man's effect, however, can be attributed to its musical heritage, its eerie atmosphere of impending threat engendered primarily through the heavy usage of folk songs. On the second day of his visit, Sergeant Howie encounters a group of children dancing around a maypole, the increasingly rapid tempo of their song lending a sense of unsettling urgency to their otherwise harmless actions. The song outlines the basis of the community's beliefs, namely reincarnation and the old gods of the earth and the sun. The paganism which characterizes the islanders immediately establishes the film's religious commentary. Howie is a fundamentalist Christian, his views steadfast and self-assured. He is repulsed and repelled by what he encounters in Summerisle, the openly practiced sexual rituals and teaching to schoolchildren of phallic symbolism the direct antithesis to his conservative views of celibacy and quietly reverential worship. Played inimitably by Edward Woodward, Howie in many ways represents 1970s British society itself, at one point sternly reminding Lord Summerisle\u2014the leader of the island, authoritatively portrayed by the great Christopher Lee\u2014that he remains the subject of a Christian country. The dynamic that exists between the two characters juxtaposes their respective faiths, Howie's protestations that Summerisle is a place of heathenism and the community's practices ludicrous indulgences in sacrilegious nonsense countered immediately, the similarly far-fetched elements of Christian doctrine highlighted, scrutinized, and ridiculed as just as unbelievable and absurd. Lee brings an avuncular grace to his performance, his retorts simultaneously firmly definitive and benignly inoffensive\u2014a description, incidentally, which rather effectively summates the film itself. Whilst not strictly anti-Catholic, the film takes a skeptical stance to organized religion, Woodward's depiction of his character as uptight and immovably fastidious deliberately preventing the audience from meaningful identification with him. Summerisle and its population are presented in such a way that we are made to question whether the strict society Howie represents is really a more appealing prospect. The island is inexplicably opulent, its crime rate all but non-existent, its inhabitants close-knit and undeniably satisfied with life. Indeed, even Howie himself is tempted by the allure of this alternative way of life, a particularly memorable scene in which the young woman in the room next to his nakedly dances, pounding his wall and singing a hypnotically mesmeric song conveying the testing of his ideologies. Like the audience, Howie is fascinated by this culture and, though he maintains an austere facade, sees in it the kind of free-spirited life which he can never himself enjoy.Effectively utilizing music to create an atmosphere of tense unease, The Wicker Man is a film replete with religious imagery, symbolism, and detailed commentary upon the role of religion in society and its effect upon its followers. Impressively acted\u2014particularly by its two leads\u2014it is the kind of film which remains embedded in the mind long after viewing, its chilling effect making it impossible to forget.

            "content": "There are actually two main \"versions\" of this film. The first, heavily cut for its original cinema release, is the one most people have seen. Then there is the fully restored version, all cuts replaced but with a grainy quality that makes them stand out somewhat (the negatives were lost, and so the \"missing\" scenes had to be taken from prints of an older copy).The cut version of the film feels rushed and incomplete in places, and some early character development is lost. I find the complete version significantly more entertaining and satisfying on the whole, despite the quality issues of some of the shots.The Wicker Man is not scary in an obvious way. It's nothing like, say, The Exorcist. The Wicker Man doesn't hit you in the face with horror; it quietly creeps up on you. That creepy feeling dawns on you slowly, and the atmosphere is built up with care. The way all the villagers act indifferently or defensively to the supposed disappearance or murder of a young girl is disturbing, especially as everyone seems to be hiding something - even the girl's classmates.This is one of my main criticisms of the cut (or butchered) version of the film: not quite enough time is given to that subtle process of building up the suspense of the film. Such was the cutting that the two nights Sgt. Howie spends on the island are reduced to a single night, and several entire sequences are lost.The full version, however, is a small masterpiece. The central idea of this closed-off pagan community, generally peaceful but indulging in the occasion ritual of human sacrifice, is delicious. Edward Woodward as Howie is on top acting form, as is Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle. The ending of The Wicker Man (from which the title gets its name) must go down as one of the most genuinely shocking in cinema history. You just don't expect the main protagonist to come to such a horrific end. Because the film plays it cool up until that point and never goes over the top, the ending also seems harrowingly believable. I also liked the idea that, in terms of what may lie beyond death, both Howie and the villagers get some kind of \"pay-off\" from the ritual. The islanders get the reassurance that their crops will thrive in the coming year, and Howie gets a martyr's death and a kind of sainthood that seems fitting. The film made me think a lot about belief systems - who is to say paganism is less valid than any other system of religion? All religions are sustained by faith and passion rather than reason or evidence.Thought-provoking, strangely beautiful, and just plain creepy, the restored version of The Wicker Man is a must for any horror movie fan's DVD collection. But even if you're not usually a fan of horror, you're likely to take something away from this burnt offering. The word \"classic\" was invented for this brilliant and eccentric film.",

            "content": "\"The Wicker Man\" is a subversive, double-edged fable about the attractions and terrors of the primitive and ritualistic.  It simultaneously criticizes and endorses the hedonism of the 1960s in a gleefully ironic fashion. Howie, supposed hero and only representative of decent, conventional society, is a dim, guilt-ridden figure while the islanders, initially presented as suspicious, menacing rustics, led by the suave, charming Lord Summerisle, are a liberated, fun-loving community, determined to protect their way of life.  The movie is blatant in the presentation of their obsession with procreation, rejection of traditional Western taboos about sexuality, and worship of nature.  Summerisle is a clean, brightly lit place, that comibines edenic innocence with hidden threat, and, depending upon your point of view, is either devoid of evil or its evil is concealed under a seductive surface.  The sense of a world ruled by ritual and in tune with nature is underlined by the constant use of folk music rather than the menacing scores associated with horror films.The movie belongs to two traditions - films of witchcraft and paranoid thrillers about city folk who find themselves the victims of rural plotters and conspirators.  It is imperfect, and at times overplayed.  Some of its appeal comes from its troubled history.  It became an instant hit among a small group of horror fans when it was released with 16 minutes cut by British Lion, a company undergoing a change of management and whose executives disliked the picture.  It went into distribution as a supporting feature with \"Don't Look Now\", a truly sensational double-bill.  There are thematic similarities and a close resemblance between Howie's pursuit of the fleeing dragon-headed hobby horse and Donald Sutherland's pursuit of the red-coated dwarf through the Venetian canals.  Because it wasn't given a press screening or advertised much, \"The Wicker Man\"'s reputation spread mostly by word of mouth.",

            "content": "The story involves a police officer (Edward Woodward) flying to a Scottish isle to find a missing girl. As a devout Christian he is horrified to learn that the islanders have long ago rejected Christianity in favor of paganism. He starts to suspect that the entire populace is involved with the girl's disappearance.Many people peg \"The Wicker Man\" as a horror film, but this is not correct. Yes, it ends as a horror story but the first 85% of the film is a mix of other film genres -- mystery/detective, musical and erotica.The cast features Christopher Lee as the head pagan Lord Summerisle. Britt Ekland and Ingrid Pitt are also on hand.WHAT WORKS: The picture was filmed on location in Scotland and features some truly breath-taking photography. It'll definitely make you want to visit this magnificent region of the earth.Britt Ekland plays \"Willow,\" the hotel-keeper's daughter, and she has an excellent scene trying to lure Woodward out of his room for some late-night amorous activity. Her siren-song \"How Do\" is a soothing and moving piece of music. Sometimes I just put on this scene to enjoy (I'm talking musically, of course, but Ekland is pleasing to look at as well). The film is worth getting just for this song.The May-pole song is also a catchy folk ditty.***SPOILER ALERT*** The ending is also a bit unexpected. I kept waiting for Woodward to escape his terrible predicament, but it never happened -- they literally fried his a$$! ***END SPOILER*** WHAT DOESN'T WORK: As the mystery progresses and Woodward does his detective work the story fails to capture your undivided attention. In other words, the story has a decidedly lazy vibe to it; your mind may wander at times. Needless to say, if you have a problem with ACDC -- I'm sorry, I mean ADHD -- you probably won't like this picture.THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND: This is an early 70s British film and so naturally has that Hammer film vibe, even though it's not a Hammer film. The folk songs and soundtrack naturally reflect this era. So, if you don't like Hammer films or early 70s folk/hippie music you probably won't appreciate \"The Wicker Man.\" Also, there is a lot of nudity, even in the short version, so if nudity offends you skip this one.FINAL ANALYSIS: This is a very original film that successfully mixes various film genres. As far as originality goes \"The Wicker Man\" is 5-Stars film all the way. It's worthy of its 'cult film' status. It's dated, however, and therefore screams out for a remake. Hence, although nothing can ever take the place of the original, I'm personally looking forward to the remake.FINAL THOUGHT: Did the mainland police officer REALLY lose in this story? Philippians 1:21 states, \"to live is Christ and to die is gain.\"GRADE: B-",

            "content": "British film director Robin Hardy, who passed away this year at the age of 86, only made three movies during his lifetime, and his debut feature THE WICKER MAN, now has undergone a long way to become a religious horror cult after its initial cold shoulder from critics and audience upon its release in its home turf. In the brief preface before the opening credits, Sergeant Howie (Woodward) is seen as a devout Christian, which underpins his martyr-status like Jesus in the Eucharist. Shortly after, the film relocates entirely on an Scottish island, Summerisle, where Howie comes to tackle with the case of a missing young girl, only gets increasingly miffed and discombobulated through the investigation where Celtic paganism is blatantly worshipped by its villagers, what's more horrific is that his advent is completely premeditated with a hidden agenda, and there is absolutely no way for him to leave this insular place.Far from being a conventional jump-scare horror fare, a salient feature of THE WICKER MAN is its mysterious set-up towards the final money-shot, which is constituted of a magnanimous supply of ethereal folk songs, often in diegetic forms, imbues a distinctly ritualistic otherworldliness, where symptoms of degeneration and heresy suffuse the film: the flagrant lies, the open-air lovemaking (with women uniformly stay on top), the eroticized close-up of a snail as an emblem of carnal consummation, the unorthodox teaching school children about phallic worship, a frog-swallowing medical treatment, a wriggling nude dance of telepathic seduction, the May Day celebration with animal costumes, masquerades and escapades. To a modern viewer who takes a more clement slant on religious persuasion, these sequences are mind-opening, palatably surreal, anything but threatening if they are not benighted enough to believe in human sacrifice. However, that is the road where this lucid story heads, the collision course between Christianity and paganism is inexorable, Hardy and screenwriter Anthony Shaffer pull no punches to leave its audience downright astonished, refuse to tamper the ending with a deus ex machina. So that is all she writes, a cunningly composed tale of religion foolery to an appalling effect. Certainly Sgt. Howie doesn't deserve this denouement, but surprisingly, there is less pathos out of it, since Woodward's stern and self-righteous performance doesn't make him a sympathetic hero, he is obstinately blunt and incredulously naive, could he have been more tactful and less religion- frenetic, at least, he would have find some ally among the folks, perhaps someone who hasn't been completely brainwashed by Lord Summerisle (Lee), thus it would turn out to be another story less confrontational. Overall, the cast is adequately one-dimensional, save the almighty Christopher Lee, who is visibly relishing in his suave and eloquent mastermind persona, a true form of evil but a charismatic villain who can compellingly entrance his adherents.With the iconic \"wicker man\" image immutably leaving an indelible fingerprint on audience's mind, Robin Hardy's one-hit-wonder promisingly retains its inimitable appeal by coalescing the horror genre with such inherently incongruous epithets as gaily, lilting and a hero's undoing.",

I then saw that it was being shown on TV, so in the interests of film I recorded it and watched it back the next day. Having read that it was a Horror film, I went in with a little hesitation as I am not a huge horror fan, although I must admit the first Halloween is film gold.I always try to keep an open mind when it comes to watching films and try not to be influenced by other reviews etc, so went into this with that in mind. As I started to watch the film unfold it was obvious from the start where this was going. Basically a Police Sgt is sent to a remote island in Scotland from the main land to investigate the supposed disappearance of a young girl. As soon as the main character arrives you realise he is out of his depth from the beginning. The character Sgt Howie, played by the excellent Edward Woodward believes he is the one in charge and his word is final because he has the law and God on his side, being a devote Christian. He believes he has the moral high ground over the people on the island because as his investigation, which was very poorly executed takes place he discovers a secret society of Pagan worshippers with liberal sex views, who are completely mad. Because he is blinded by faith and incompetence it ends badly.I was not impressed. For a Sgt who is a supervisor, in charge of other officers he never does his pre-investigation ground work or takes any precautions.(This is not seen in the film at any point.) He then travels to a remote island alone,which doesn't having any police presence, with only his uniform, pocket note book, truncheon, handcuffs ( I presume he had his truncheon and handcuffs with him as you are required to have them when on duty- but didn't see them) and mouth, from the mainland and you the viewer are supposed to be surprised when the villagers turn against him. I wasn't. I found the story to be very very weird and slow, boring and poorly executed. It is very undeserving of its cult status. It is not a horror film as some would make you believe and not frightening in the least. The whole premise was spoilt by the weak script. The character of the Sgt was written by someone who clearly doesn't know anything about the police service which served to ruin the story further. My summary says it all.",

But because of my expectations of it being a 'horror' film, and purportedly an excellent one, I was disappointed.However, watching this 15 years later, I enjoyed this much more more. I think this is because I have lived longer now and understand much more the danger and terror involved in groupthink and how easily we can all be a victim of the cult of opinion and shunned out to tragic consequences. This is especially true in this day and age of cancel culture where even people of the highest esteem one day are literally put in the stocks and scourged from society the next. One could reliably imagine that we are only a few short mistakes away from there being real world wicker man type rituals taking place on the streets of America for people having the wrong opinion.So yes the horror involved in this movie is most certainly real and visceral and I GET it now.

Such a film was 1973's 'The Wicker Man', scripted by Anthony Shaffer ( author of 'Sleuth' ) and directed by Robin Hardy. The legend goes that when British Lion boss Michael Deeley saw an early version he hated it so much he cut it to ribbons and to this day no-one knows where the missing footage went. But its popularity grew through word of mouth.I first saw it in 1988 when it was shown on B.B.C.-2 as part of 'Moviedrome', a series devoted to cult films hosted by Alex Cox. From the opening ( a poor quality clip of Sgt.Neil Howie praying in church ) I was hooked. Howie flies to the remote Scottish island of Summerisle, to investigate a complaint concerning the apparent disappearance of a little girl named Rowan Morrison. Right from the word go, he senses something is up. The locals stare at him as though he has stepped off a spaceship. He finds that Christianity is only taught in the local school as a comparative religion, and that the inhabitants are Pagan. Children dance naked round fires, couples fornicate in public places, penis-shaped trees are all over the place, the locals sing ribald songs about Willow McGregor ( Britt Ekland ), the buxom daughter of the landlord of the inn where Howie is staying.When Howie confronts Lord Summerisle ( Christopher Lee ), he expresses astonishment at finding a place so steeped in Paganism he can barely believe it exists in the 20th century. He continues his investigations, but the locals prove obstinate. Finally, he discovers what happened to young Rowan, and the answer has horrifying repercussions for him personally...That is all I want to tell you of the plot. Watch the film for yourself. Edward Woodward, who sadly died two days ago, is simply brilliant as 'Sgt.Howie', a God-fearing policeman determined to carry out his duties despite being led down wrong paths. In a particularly memorable scene, he is in bed while a naked Willow pounds on the wall next door, tempting him. Many men would not be able to resist her ( me included! ), but his faith keeps him pure. Also good is Christopher Lee as 'Lord Summerisle', a role far removed from 'Count Dracula'. He is charming and sinister. Diane Cilento and Ingrid Pitt give Ekland competition in the looks department.Fans of 'Rab C.Nesbitt' should keep an eye peeled for a young Barbara 'Ella' Rafferty and Tony 'Jamesie Cotter' Roper in small roles.The whole film is superbly written and shot, getting its 'scares' from atmosphere and mood, rather than blood and gore. Another of its strengths is Paul Giovanni's folk music. The final scene apparently terrified Woodward when he filmed it, and it is not hard to see why. It makes an incredibly powerful climax to this motion picture.'The Wicker Man' has often been described as a pro-Pagan film. I do not agree. It is apparent that the inhabitants of Summerisle are wasting their time by worshipping their gods, just as Sgt.Howie's faith in his ultimately serves him no good. It is anti-religious if anything. I do not really regard it as a horror film either ( only one person dies in the whole movie ). It is more of a mystery.Forget the pointless Nicolas Cage remake and watch this instead. It gets better with each viewing, whereas one viewing of the Cage version was more than enough.",

            "content": "It is refreshing to come across a vehicle that makes maximum use of actor Chistopher Lee's understated talents, and THE WICKER MAN is certainly such a film. I first read of this work in the pages of FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND when it was released in 1973, and had heard very little of it in the years following until I stumbled across a copy of THE WICKER MAN in a cutout VHS bin off of Herald Square six years ago. The work does far more than live up to the hyperbole that Forrest Ackerman is remembered for in his fantasy film journalism.Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodword) is a hard line Christian police sergeant who is called off of his regular beat to investigate the disappearance of a fourteen year old girl. He flies off to Summerisle,a community of pagan believers who still observe the seasonal rituals connected to remote Celtic harvest demigods, who are honored yearly by the ceremony of the Wickerman. The leader of the community, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee)is a sardonically affable host, and the community Howie is picking through enjoy playing their game of cat and mouse with him. There are a good many red herrings that obfuscate the increasingly confused Sergeant Howie, not the least of which is the joyful and raunchy sex baiting that is offered him by his road house manager's daughter Willow (Britt Ekland). And, though he cannot realize it at the time, it is Willow who offers him his only way out after he arrives at Summerisle.But, as the Christian Proverbs tell us, a fool always returns to his folly like a dog to its vomit. And so it is with Sergeant Howie. All of his righteousness will not prevent his appointment with the Wicker Man. The entire town has been playing a game with him, and it began in his own bailiwick. The climax of this film is one of the most shattering and emotionally wrenching of any Gothic film I've viewed. Mr. Christopher Lee comes through true to the form for which he is famed, but in a manner far more frightening then any previous gig he played with red contact lenses. In THE WICKER MAN, screenplay author Anthony Shaffer created a storyline with a number of surprises that make this work one of such calibre as his earlier work SLEUTH.THE WICKER MAN, in short, is a wonder,and quite possibly the first postmodern horror film. Make of it what you will, but I'd be very surprised if it doesn't keep you up thinking on any rainy night you view it.",

            "content": "One of the other things about suspense thrillers that make them suspenseful is the protagonist forced out of his or her comfort zone or element, this it's based on our subconscious fear of an area were not familiar with or even understand will turn against us. This film isn't exactly a horror movie, it's more of a supernatural suspense thriller.And the film may have been one of the partial inspirations for \"The X-Files\" yeah I could see an episode of Mulder and Skully visiting this island.The suspense is of a different kind, it's similar to the films \"Angel Heart\" and \"The Ninth Gate\" where on the surface it seems like a simple cut and dry hunt to find someone or something. But as you get more deeply engaged in the mystery you have a feel or realize it's about a lot more. It's all a math equation where you know it's all going to add up to something but the question is what. It's suspenseful because we know that the protagonist really should quit at some point because you have a feel if not exact proof that whatever it all adds up to it's not good. But at the same time you can't help but want to see it though to the end because you simply want to know what it all means; it's the common strength and folly of the need to know.I love the sense of isolation which adds to the unsafe feeling. There is just no one you really can trust in this film not just from the unusual nature of the people but that none are whom they seem, most I never found completely likable because it's like their nice but then their not. My favorite suspenseful moment no doubt is the game of chance where everyone has to be in line to stand inside a series of sword blades in the form of a star for an amount of time, if one is left in the circle when time runs out well you can guess what happens next.The visual and production value is great, it was fascinating and really strange at the same time just seeing the Celtic Pagan practices exercised in modern times, it really has the feeling of a world where these practices are the norm. My favorite is no doubt seeing the may day festival and everyone in all those bizarre masks and costumes, it was sort of the pagan version of Marti Graz. I even like the in-depth knowledge on all the pagan symbols and rituals, hearing about it made me want to know more.The music is great as well despite not my style it really fits with the film. And this film has a lot of music moments which almost makes this film a bit of a musical, and one of the ones I personally in my book since I personally am not a fan of the genre only other one I like is \"Dr.Horrible's Sing A Long Blog\" but that's a different story. Anyway, I really like the music and songs because of how strange they are as well as their sexuality overtones.The late Edward Woodward as Sergent Howie is good. It's true his character isn't totally likable, he's kinda repressed, pompous, not cool. However he's worthy of some sympathy because he has common sense and clearly out of place in the island. You can emphasize with his disorientation as we see in his eyes certain things that even we don't see everyday. Like seeing sexual acts in the public eye, naked girls in some fertility dance jumping though a bon fire (wonder if anyone ever died in that one), and others I don't want to give away you have to see to believe. You can share a bit in his disdain because certain things people do and say are ethically questionable.But to me the one character that really drives this film for me is Lord Summerisle played by one of my favorite actors Christopher Lee. This to me is probably my favorite role from him because his character is sort of on the gray area because he's not exactly a villain despite what he does at the end he would be. I find his character likable he feels like someone I could be friends with; he has charisma, he's interesting seems to have a lot of hobbies, he loves having fun and life, sociable. However he also has a sinister nature that brews within and when we see it near the end it is both disarming and sends a chill.The interesting thing about the film is seeing the constant conflict in both the Christianity and Pagan faiths. Both Howie and Lord Summerisle I feel are two sides of the same coin, both of them are strongly devoted in what they believe in. But their folly is in their inflexibility from Howie's lack of understanding of the culture as well as his repression which keeps him from being more human. Summerisle isn't completely up to the times and it's ethical boundaries, he believes that the old ways still work but when time moves on it always produces different results.The ending is unforgettable, seeing it turned my blood cold because I knew in that moment there was nothing more anyone could do.If your looking for something different in the suspense thriller genre then give this film a try, I guarantee you you won't get burned.Rating: 4 stars",

He flies out to the island and during his investigations discovers that the entire population follows a neo-pagan cult under the island's owner Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), believing in re-incarnation, worshiping the sun and engaging in fertility rituals and sexual magic in order to appease immanent natural forces. Howie, an extremely devout and conservative Christian, is increasingly shocked by the islanders' behavior; yet, he is attracted and repulsed by the alluring and sexual Willow (Britt Ekland), the landlord's daughter. He receives no assistance in his search from the islanders, who initially deny Morrison exists and then say that she recently died. Howie persists and uncovers evidence suggesting the girl was a victim, or perhaps is soon to be a victim, of human sacrifice. Delving deeper into the island's culture, he disguises himself as Punch, a principal character of the May Day festival, to uncover the details of the ceremony\u0085 ---Summary from Wikipedia--------------------------------------- This is a great example of what I call the \"stranger-in-a-strange land\" movie genre. While Howie, who is as 'male virgin' and a devote Christian, may deplore the pagan religion of these strange island people, he has a hard time justifying why his religion is more rational than theirs. For example, after witnessing young virgin girls forming a circle and jumping over a fire naked, he asks Lord Summerisle why he allow such immoral behavior on his island. Lord Summerisle explains that the girls are enjoying their divinity lessons representing parthenogenesis\u2014reproduction without sexual union.Howie explodes, \"What ever is this? I mean you've got fake biology, fake religion. Sir, have these children never heard of Jesus?\"..\"Himself the son of virgin impregnated by a ghost\" Lords Summerisle interrupts, implying 'is OUR religion any less rational than YOURS?This story challenges modern traditional beliefs, with the music, dances, costumes and customs of the island hearkening back to an older time before Christianity replaced Gaelic paganism. The movie is not only challenging and unsettling but leaves us with an unforgettable ending.",

            "content": "(Some spoilers, or hints at spoilers) Despite a rather flawed premise in which a solo Sergeant named Howie (Edward Woodward, '\"Breaker\" Morant') investigates a missing girl in an island community somewhere near Scotland, 'The Wicker Man' proves to be compelling viewing. One could argue that his precinct was short staffed, and his lone Detective status was natural given the circumstances. However, usually I believe more than one Police Officer will investigate a disappearance of a girl, especially if it's within a remote community and unfamiliar territory! Regardless, Edward Woodward's uptight extremely Christian Sergeant is quite a contrast to the community he explores, and he soon finds himself at odds with their religious Pagan practises, and how the community is raising the children of the island, as he searches for the missing girl.Christopher Lee plays Lord Summerisle, the leader of the community, and deceivingly helpful host in Howie's search. It seems the entire community are constantly lying to this would-be Detective, but as the story unfolds, you might be able to click what is exactly going on up until its rather terrifying conclusion. Christopher Lee has his familiar trademark presence, but it was Edward Woodward who really made this film for me. His performance is exactly in this strange film that borders on a musical/thriller/hippy film that explores cults, and I found myself really rooting for his character- who in reality was the underdog, as he holds to true to his beliefs and the law he works for. 'The Wicker Man' is not your typical thriller/horror movie (several musical numbers will see to that), and you can see the 1970s look and influence within this film. However, 'The Wicker Man' proves you don't need heaps of blood and gore to show horror, and debut director Robin Hardy shows us a good job of that through Howie's eyes-- as the community Howie explores unravels, and as our isolated hero becomes more disturbingly isolated throughout the story! 'The Wicker Man's' themes, issues and conclusion will ultimately garner a response from its audience, and Anthony Shaffer's story is good enough to keep the viewer interested. Overall, I thought it was really good, and while I can't say I liked the ending, it was perfectly disturbing enough given the content and direction of the film! Oh, and a very weird...but a very attractive Britt Ekland is in it too! **** out of *****!",

Cult horror films have always impressed me, from the low-budget gags of The Evil Dead to the exploitative depraved nature of Cannibal Holocaust and The Last House on the Left. While these films are dark, intense and sometime funny, The Wicker Man not, except maybe a little funny(unintentionally). A Scottish Police Sergeant, played by Edward Woodward, is sent to investigate the disappearance of a local girl on a small island off of mainland Scotland. The people of the community seem a bit strange in contrast to the \"all business\" sergeant Howie. Nobody seems to recognize this girl at first, but the people's stories change as they contradict themselves. Howie's quest soon brings him to the lands mysterious leader Lord Summerisle, played by Christopher Lee(who else?), where he learns the island's pagan history is responsible for the people's promiscuous behavior. The acting is solid by the two leads and the plot is somewhat intriguing. Don't be fooled. They call this a horror, but it's not the least bit scary. The pagan rituals are campy rather than black; like the performances you'd see at amusement parks for kids. They say it's also a thriller, but it's hard to be \"thrilled\" when the plot's laid out so easy and predictable. It's more a musical than anything. They couldn't go 5 minutes without breaking out into some of the worst Scottish folk songs imaginable, singing about the \"corn ring and barley\" or \"the landlord daughter\". The whole film I was waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never comes. No scary atmosphere. No foreboding rhythm. Just song and dance for the whole family.",

My evidence that the film is an expose of the Illuminati? The small rowing boat which takes Edward Woodward's policeman Neale Howie from his plane to the Island has, painted on its side, a single eye - the famous illuminati symbol. The island itself works as a metaphor for our modern environment: everywhere one looks there are the marks of paganism and the old gods. Perhaps the arrival of Howie in a plane shows his (humanity's) descent into a lower state of consciousness, one which must ultimately lead to human sacrifice (the final symbol of the Wicker Man itself standing for all the wars, torture and atrocities which have risen from the human form in Capitalist/Materialist society). The name - Neale Howie - may be telling us that here is a man who can have the humility (he knows how to kneel) to look up to a higher state of human/divine consciousness (Christ), rather than being tied to unregenerate nature, as the islanders under Summerisle's rule are.   The way in which sex and conformism (i.e. having babies) is indoctrinated into the children at their school mirrors the relentless way in which our wider culture drums these same things into the poor plebian population. Perhaps the most extraordinary sequence has Howie - unable to get his plane to take off again - follows the constantly vanishing Hobby Horse around the island's twisting alleys. Surely there is no more poignant and sinister portrayal of the human tendency to follow vanishing whisps (each of us has our own special ones, our \"hobby horses\") which take us nowhere but to ignominious doom.   The death of the king of fools in the end shows us how the side of us which desires justice, higher consciousness and meaningful relationships (true romance) is forever roasted before the heathen gods of produce and natural phenomena. The head falls of to reveal nothing of substance, but rather the glowing single eye of the natural sun - the oldest of the pagan symbols and furthermore worshipped down the years by the Illuminati.",

            "content": "'Oh Christ, oh Jesus Christ!' Christopher Lee is dismissive of a lot of his screen-work, but this is one of his favorites (along-with The Whip and the Body). It's hard to call this a horror-film, but I guess you could say it is, depending-upon who you root-for. There really are no villains in this film, though hardcore religionists would say the pagans who inhabit the island are evil are just flat-wrong. Western civilization still has its sacrifices in our American death-penalty, and in warfare. Almost every generation is called-up to give-of-their-numbers to Mars, and the bottom-line. So-called conservative economists argue that a minimum-of-poverty is needed to maintain-capitalism/consumerism. There are sacrifices-aplenty in our 'modern' world, and they are hardly-removed from pagan-sacrifices, just more-removed and indirect from our daily-lives (what could be more \"modern\"?). Oddly, the film is critical of the ancient and the modern.No, this is more a thriller, with a 'horror-reveal' at its climax, as it was created by director Robin Hardy. Sadly, the producers of the failing UK-studio balked at his cut, and we have been left-with cobbled-together theatrical and 'director's-cut' versions of the films with many of the scenes and insert-shots back, but from shoddy-sources like videotapes. The original-negatives of deleted material were hidden in-a-hole on an English country-road, according to Christopher Lee and others close to the production. Why? Why did RKO destroy an hour of Orson Welles's 'Magnificent Ambersons'? This is done as retribution by producers, so that a director can never reinsert-the-footage. Why? Partly because producers cannot usually create, and some of them resent this. It also gives them a chance to legally-assert authorship, and thus ownership of a property based under international copyright laws. Due to the butchering of The Wicker Man, Christopher Lee has attempted for decades to do a remake, but it appears it isn't going-to-happen with him now. The Nicholas Cage remake can only suffer from this fact, since it doesn't improve-upon the original. It actually does a poorer-job, yet has a budget almost twenty-times the 1973-version.Literally 'stealing-the-show', Lee plays the enigmatic and charming Lord Summerisle, and he haunts the entirety of the Wicker Man until the brutal-ending. The other protagonist of the film is the character of Sergeant Howie, who has been sent by the mainland-Police to investigate the disappearance of young-girl on the island, namesake of the Lee-character. This island is Lee's domain, and he has reinstituted pagan-beliefs alongside the island's agriculture--fruit-groves in the cold, hostile-environment of the Hebrides. The cop is entering a world he (and we, the audience) never knew existed. Unlike the remake, I'd say the Summerisle seems inviting and sensual. It's a place you might want to call home. As a stodgy-Christian, Howie doesn't really get this, and it seals-his-fate, a nice touch of irony.It appears the 'new-beliefs' (really ancient, British-ones) are working, for the crops are abundant and the people of Summerisle seem happy and prosperous. There are numerous-references to fertility-symbols, and the musical-numbers are both-inviting and haunting (if not a little goofy), & they lull Howie and the viewer into a complacency (as pagan-rituals do to their sacrifices). Seargeant Howie (a daft-name, chosen so the audience doesn't fully-identify with him) is being tested by the pagans for his purity, and the gorgeous Britt Ekland is the bait, though her acting is a bit 'wooden' (or is it 'Wicker'?). Still, she--and her body-double--add a great erotic-flavor to the film that makes paganism seem pretty inviting. Well, unless you are the sacrifice, though believers would likely have no-problem. This then, is the horror-component of the film, a non-believer sacrificed by believers.There are many-reviewers who have said this is about a battle-between paganism and orthodox-Christianity. This is accurate, but there are nuances to this, and comments on the surrender-to-irrationality by the pagans AND Sergeant Howie. Let's-face-it: the cop isn't likable, and we aren't really supposed to identify with him until the end, as simply a human-being caught-up in something he never wagered-on. Like a pagan-initiation, the story begins as a mystery, both tempting-and-warm, even human. The initiate penetrates more-and-more layers of the mystery of the cult until...you'll have to watch the movie, it is an ending for-the-ages. There really isn't any gore here, just a little-blood, so gorehounds won't like-it, but who cares? This is inverse-horror.",

            "content": "Most horror movies never live up to that name. They're actually \"scare movies\" or \"shock movies\" or even \"sick titillation\" movies. The Wicker Man, though, is true to its genre. This film will unsettle, it will disturb and it will horrify you.Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) is a policeman summoned to a tiny island off the coast of Scotland to investigate the disappearance of a child. From the very moment he lands his seaplane and sets foot on Summerisle, Howie finds nothing but confusion and oddity. He can't get a straight answer from anyone about what happened to the girl or if she even existed. The girl's own mother won't tell him the truth. Howie does observe strange rituals, midnight orgies and blasphemous behavior. He finally meets Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), who won't give him any answers about the missing girl but does tell Howie of the history of the island and the pagan religion that took hold of it. It is in that heathen worship that Howie comes to suspect that the missing girl's fate was death\u0085or something worse.There is a lot to praise about The Wicker Man, but you have to start by lauding the two elements that have become the unique calling cards of this movie. Firstly, this is probably the only truly Christian horror movie. And I don't mean there are a bunch of demons and angels in the story or anything like that. At the heart of this film is a conflict between Christian faith and Christian living and the ancient superstitions and practices of paganism. Beyond a threat to life and limb, this movie challenges Christian belief and propriety. There is a lot of nudity and bawdiness in the story, but its presence is not to arouse but to tempt Christian virtue. The Wicker Man is a movie about depravity, degeneracy, brutality and death that remains suitable material for a church group because of the undeniably Christian dynamic at its heart.The other defining aspect of this film is that it is probably the only true horror-musical. There is a lot of people singing in this movie and none of it is meant to be ironic of comedic or to wink at the audience in some fashion. All of the songs and music play a role in creating and establishing the crazy and evil society Sergeant Howie falls into. Not only does it make everything on the island seem unreal and otherworldly, but the contrast between the jolly, happy songs of the pagans and the ominous and terrible acts that occur amplifies the discomfort and unease in the viewer.Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee are outstanding as the parochially Christian Sergeant Howie and the paradoxically more worldly pagan Lord Summerisle. The clash between these two men is one of the great standoffs in horror cinema and neither swings and ax or waives a machete at the other. Woodward plays a man of rigid faith but never lets that rigidity imprison Howie or turn him into an unsympathetic martinet. Lee's performance is even more subtle, playing a character who's meant to be more in tune with the feelings and attitudes of modern audiences yet never letting viewers ignore or deny the evil that dwells in Summerisle's heart.There's very little graphic violence in The Wicker Man and it's from an era when horror movies would often start out like a different kind of film, in this case a missing person mystery, before twisting into something awful before the audience's very eyes. So, if you've been weaned on the gorefests and overwrought suspense of horror films in the last several decades, you might need to have a little patience. If you stick with it, though, this movie will creep you out like few things you have ever seen. The Wicker Man is not a thrill ride. It is not supposed to be funny or exciting. It is a horror movie. Watch it at your own risk.And for pete's sake, make sure when you rent it that you're getting the original and not the thrice-damned remake starring Nicholas Cage. That one isn't a horror movie. It's just horrifyingly awful.",

He is wrong, dreadfully wrong. Secondly, he seems to think that musical sequences involving percussive nudity addressed to the camera have their place in horror films.  I couldn't begin to figure out where that idea came from.     Thirdly, his so-called hero, the character we're supposed to root for, is basically an angry nun, expressing his pious disapproval to everyone he meets, and never once shutting up about Jesus. Wicker Man is supposed to be a horror classic, to be put on the shelf next to Rosemary's Baby, the Exorcist, and the Shining.  Well, this belief as almost as misguided as the film itself, which belongs next to Slumber Party Massacre and maybe an instructional video about drywall. I suppose if you're looking for camp on the level of Incubus, then you've found the right film.  But if you're looking for something scary, or meaningful, or entertaining, or even non-cringe-inducing, then put Wicker Man back on the shelf.",

            "content": "The \"Wicker man\" is a cult classic highly rated by some reviewers that I respect very much.\"The Wicker man\" has in interesting story. A police-officer from the mainland goes to a Scottish island in connection with the disappearance of a girl. Initially the local population remains absolutely silent, but after a while the officer supsects a relation with the pagan religion that still reigns on this island.The hostile silence in the local bar at the beginning of the film reminds of \"Strawdogs\" (1971, Sam Peckinpah). The police officer is as much a stranger to the locals as the American professor Sumner in \"Straw dogs\". The idea of a pagan religion still excisting at the edge of Europe (in stead of a voodoo religion in the third world like in \"I walked with a zombie\" (1943, Jacques Tourneur)) is refreshing and contradicting a false sense of Western superiority. For the anthropological aspects of paganism some reviewers refer to \"The golden bough\" (1890, James G. Frazer).There is however one big drawback to the interesting story of \"The Wicker man\". It is mainly used as en excuse to show female nudity (apparantly the old rituals dit not prescribe male nudity). That the '70s sex symbol Britt Ekland is cast in one of the roles is absolutely no coincidence.",

            "content": "A police sergeant visits a remote Scottish island to investigate the disappearance of a young girl.  The locals on Summer Isle treat Sergeant Howie with a mixture of suspicion and amused disdain.  Gradually, he comes to realise that a pagan religion holds sway over the islanders, and they are guarding a sinister secret ...\"The Wicker Man\" is what is known as a 'cult' movie, meaning that students like to watch it.  Apart from the climax, which in fairness does have a certain frisson of horror to it, the film is actually excruciatingly bad.  Made in 1973, it sports a kind of folk-music trendiness which has dated horribly over the years.  Songs like \"Corn Rigs And Barley Rigs\" are just plain silly.  There was also a fad at the time for so-called 'ritual theatre', and this manifests itself in the form of chanting and rhythmic swaying on the part of the islanders.  It is supposed to evoke the dark uncontrollable urges of the human beast, but the ritual scenes are more likely to make a modern viewer laugh than tremble.Edward Woodward plays the straitlaced sergeant with the strict christian beliefs who finds himself stranded amongst the heathens.  He looks good, and even acts a little towards the end, but Neil Howie is a ludicrous proposition from the outset. How many police sergeants in the highlands pilot their own seaplanes when they make house calls?  Do sergeants really burst into schoolrooms, erase the writing on the board, and take over the lesson unbidden?  Howie takes it on himself to walk into May Morrison's home without being invited and insult her religious beliefs.  He then conducts a single-handed search, without warrant, of every house on the island.  He even exhumes corpses on his own authority, and threatens to arrest the librarian if she doesn't show him the register of deaths (why would a librarian have this anyway?)  When Howie clubs the landlord into unconsciousness and steals his costume, the viewer has given up bristling at the improbabilities, and merely accepts that a police officer would do this.Britt Ekland as Willow, the publican's daughter, is one of the film's more radiantly ludicrous elements.  Never mind that on this bleak island there is a girl who looks like a supermodel.  There are daffier things than that awaiting us.  Britt does a mating-dance to attract the policeman, and this consists of banging her hands on the walls of the bedroom whilst boogieing around naked.  In fact it is the body double who does the boogieing, Britt's contract presumably limiting her to topless work.  The double looks different, has darker, longer hair and moves with much greater suppleness than Britt.  And then there is the dubbing.  The highland accent must have been beyond the Swedish Sexpot, because her entire dialogue is lip-synched by someone else.The maypole song is meant to convince us of the earthy, vital commitment of the islanders to metempsychosis, but it makes us cringe.  The nerdy teacher takes the lead, and the kids perform some of the crappiest choreography ever filmed.Ingrid Pitt is allowed to keep her own North European accent, which is preferable to some of the shaky Scottish accents knocking about the film, but has to undergo a gratuitous nude scene when Howie interrupts her hip-bath.  This was the era when naked breasts were considered progressive, and Britt and Ingrid were brought in to supply the nudity in every British film.If this is ignominious, think of poor Christopher Lee, playing Lord Summerisle, who has to wear a truly awful wig and sing an out-of-tune duet with Diane Cilento.  The film is shallow and lazily put together.  This is typified by the library sequence, where Sergeant Howie reads up on pagan rituals without even removing his cap.  It just so happens that there is a book on the shelf which explains the symbolism of a Mayday procession, just like the one that is about to happen.The 'celebration' is weak and unconvincing, and bathotically incorporates nursery rhymes and a heavy metal guitar solo.  Lord Summerisle makes a pointless and clumsy speech retrospectively explaining everything that we have seen. How the policeman comes to be the Fool is just laughable.Who decided that this film project had the coherence to succeed?  Who chose the terrible songs?  Who sent for Britt?  I don't know.  Who would take on the role of a prudish, meddling, anally-retentive policeman, unaccountably investigating a murder on his own?  Edward Woodward would.",

            "content": "If you've never seen or heard of The Wicker Man you're obviously an inhabitant of some remote island not dissimilar to that featured in the film, a Scottish isle upon which lands our hapless hero, Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward), a mainland copper in search of a reported missing child. \"Have you lost your bearings?\" ask the islanders on his arrival, and, considering the mess he gets into during the course of the story, he obviously had. Howie, you see, is a devout and still virginal god-fearing Presbyterian. He practises his religion as he does his job \u0096 strictly by the book (or The Book) and is appalled to discover that the island's community is still practising pagan rituals, and even worse, still teaching these rituals in the local school. So now, as well as conducting his investigation, he also feels duty bound to lead these heathens on to the path of righteousness. Thus begins a cat and mouse game as Howie pointlessly tries to pit his wits, and his religion, against the passive yet manipulative islanders, led by the charismatic Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), who are completely in control of their environment, whereas he is a man alone, a fish completely out of water, in a place where mainland laws, and his own Christian beliefs, no longer apply, his only companions being his Bible and his God.Sounds heavy doesn't it? And so it is eventually, but in the meantime we are treated to a nice travelogue of a fictitious Scottish island community, accompanied by a Celtic folk music soundtrack (no other score is involved), that yet has a simmering threat forever in the background. Howie is witness to several blasphemous goings on that you certainly wouldn't organise as part of a church fete, he is given the runaround by the villagers in his search for the child, and even his own chastity is put to the test by the pub-cum-guesthouse landlord's daughter (a dubbed Britt Ekland).Arguably a problem with the film is that Howie is not a bloke you'd get along with. He's not likable. In fact he's a pain in the arse. He is as much a zealot in his own beliefs as the islanders are believers in theirs. Also they enjoy their religion, barbaric as it sometimes transpires to be, whilst he is almost puritanically strapped into a straightjacket and almost flagellates himself with his in such a blinkered, intransigent and intolerant way that you can't help feeling that in the end he gets everything that's coming to him. But of course this is the ambiguity of the film \u0096 Who's side, in the end, do you find yourself on? But of course, that's for you to decide. Or not.The UK DVD release features two versions of the film: the theatrical version of the movie running at 84 mins, and also the extended \"Director's Cut\" running at 99 mins. The extra footage (easily spotted by the change in picture quality as it has been sourced from an original 1\" analogue telecine master 'the best element known to exist') includes scenes on the mainland before Howie leaves for the island (and consequently different opening titles) and which establish early on his anally retentive character; more footage of Lord Summerisle which develops his character and influence on the islanders a little more, and footage which establishes more clearly that Howie actually spends two nights on the island, not one, which is a little vague in the original theatrical release (or one of them \u0096 let the purists rant!).The special features include a theatrical trailer; TV and radio spots, a 25 minute American TV interview with Christopher Lee and director Robin Hardy and a 35 minute documentary 'The Wicker Man Enigma'. The animated menus are also beautifully presented with each scene selection panel featuring footage from that scene. There are also talent biographies and a special CD Rom feature providing you with the original Theatrical Press Brochure for the film. Also, exclusive to the UK release, there is a full-length commentary (on the Director's Cut version) by Edward Woodward, Christopher Lee and Robin Hardy, and moderated by British film broadcaster Mark Kermode. Mostly it's very informative, but Christopher Lee comes across as such a bolshie individual, perhaps it's his age. He keeps trying to dominate the conversation with poor director Robin Hardy eventually managing to cut in with 'Would you like me to tell you what really happened?' with Lee indignantly responding with 'Well I don't remember it being like that at all...' and also deliberately cutting the others off in mid-flow with lines like 'Can I just point out that that chap on the left worked in the Glasgow Hippodrome...' and then going off on another tangent. Then he keeps harping on about how disgraceful it was that the 'greatest British movie of all time' was deliberately hacked to pieces by the distributors, something he goes back to again and again in his best, brooding, ominous curse-ridden tones straight out of Lord of the Rings. He may well be right but hey, Chris, we got the point the first time you ranted about it. Add to that some of Robin Hardy's comments, which are often vague, confused and contradictory, and which set the ball rolling back into Lee's court again. Edward Woodward meanwhile tries uneasily to keep the mood a little lighter, change the subject and not lose his cool. Mark Kermode does well to keep it moving and in check. If you listen between the lines it's actually very entertaining. It's an atmospheric, unique and memorable film with an equally haunting soundtrack and is available on this UK release from StudioCanal in what is probably it's definitive version (but I'll let others continue to argue over that. Cue Christopher Lee\u0085).",

The film starts out with the intriguing premise of a police sergeant (Edward Woodward) attempting to locate a missing twelve year old girl on a small island off the coast of Scotland. With most of the villagers disavowing any knowledge of the young girl, and the girl's purported mother (Irene Sunters) even denying her existence, you get the sense of something malevolent going on in this closed community. And there is, but what it boils down to is a village steeped in paganism that relishes nudity and ritual sacrifice. This completely disorients the straight laced, Christian Sergeant Howie (Woodward), who nevertheless becomes convinced that the girl he's looking for is alive and somewhere on the island. One needs to consider that Rowan Morrison (Geraldine Cowper) was used as bait to lure an unsuspecting adult male to the island for the purpose of making him a human sacrifice victim to appease the nature gods and provide for a successful harvest the next growing season. The finale is quite horrific for the venerable Howie, who goes out like a martyr amidst a population of amoral citizens.Amidst all the ritualistic dancing and nudity, I was struck by one thing, and that was Mrs. Morrison's antidote for her other daughter's sore throat. It would never occur to me to relieve a frog in one's throat by placing a frog in one's throat.",

The movie has some good moments, but its whimsical tone and dated 70s sensibilities make it hard to take this story seriously. It's true that the film does not fit well into any one genre, but I would attribute that more to a lack of focus than sheer originality. The film blends police investigation with horror, erotic pagan ritual, and cheesy music and dance. Yes, that's right -- there are several unfortunate sequences featuring really bad New Age folk music presented in a musical theater format. The pagan philosophy is heavy-handed, and much of the film ends up being more comical than it is ominous. I think it would have been much better if they dropped the musical numbers, focused more on the horror elements, and offered Christopher Lee a darker, more menacing role. (For some reason, Lord Summerisle kept reminding me of Willy Wonka.) Of course, the Wicker Man is best remembered for its shocking ending. Indeed, there is an abrupt shift of tone near the end, when we realize that a sacrifice is about to take place and the wicker man is finally revealed. This sequence does evoke an effective sense of horror, however, the film then proceeds rather quickly to its inevitable conclusion. The Wicker Man is not a terrible movie, but it seems more like an interesting relic from the 70s than a timeless classic. Some may find a certain charm in its campiness, or a hint of greatness in the final act, but there is little else to recommend here.",

The film is filled with bizarre touches, haunting music and genuinely macabre scenes, all leading up to the shocking--and, sad to say, all too believable--conclusion. Britt Ekland's nude pagan dance will long remain in your memory; trust me on this one! The film version on the DVD that I just watched, despite the fact that it IS the edited print, and NOT the full-length director's cut, is a winner in every way.

This is certainly a much better film although once you know how it ends future viewings do lose some of their impact.Edward Woodward plays Sergeant Howie of the West Highland Constabulary; he has received a letter reporting that a young girl, Rowan Morrison, has gone missing on the remote Summerisle. When he gets there everybody claims that there is no such girl on the island. Even the girls supposed mother claims not to recognise the girl in the picture he has. It soon becomes clear that life on the island is very different from that on the mainland; the population has given up Christianity and taken up older Pagan practices. Some are fairly innocuous like dancing around the maypole but when Howie sees a group of islanders dancing naked in a stone circle he becomes more disturbed. As the investigation continues he comes to believe that Rowan may have been murdered and later still he comes to the dreadful conclusion that she is still alive and that Lord Summerisle and the other islanders plan to sacrifice her to their gods on May Day. As the time of sacrifice approaches he searches desperately for her and eventually finds her. This isn't where the film ends however; just as he thinks he has rescued her he learns that she was never in danger but he most certainly is.This is a strange film as it is hard to pin it down to any one genre; it could be a murder mystery except for the fact that the 'victim' is alive, it could be horror but until the very end nothing horrible happens and that comes as a shock rather than as a building feeling of dread. There is just a constant feeling that something isn't quite right on the island. The acting from Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee was great, Woodward making us believe that Howie is as devout as he claims and Lee being delightfully sinister as Lord Summerisle. The rest of the cast put in good enough performances, the most memorable was Britt Ekland, although that was mainly for her naked dance. I can't believe that anybody reading won't know how this ends but won't spoil it just in case; suffice to say it is one of the most memorable of film endings.",

I should also mention, the island and its Lord owner are real, hopefully what happens in the story there isn't. Basically police Sergeant, and Christian virgin Neil Howie (Edward Woodward) is sent to a Scottish island to investigate the reported disappearance of a teenage girl, Rowan Morrison. As he spends more time on the island, he finds the pagan peoples' behaviour, particularly sexual and blasphemous, utterly appalling, and he is not getting far with the search for Rowan. Even the owner of the island, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee in his favourite film role) is involved in this stuff, he even says in blasphemy \"God is dead\"! When Neil sees the people getting ready for their pagan ritual, he disguises himself and eventually finds Rowan. But they were not after her, and the ritual is not about her sacrifice, but Neil's. The film's concluding scenes are the most powerful and chilling, where the man of God is placed into The Wicker Man where he is burned alive, almost crucifixion because he is pure, a virgin and a Christian.

            "content": "Wowzers!! I was totally unprepared for the goings on in this movie and thought I'd be settling down to an old, predictable, 'horror' - how wrong I was. The Wicker Man, written by Anthony Shaffer and directed by Robin Hardy, is so bizarre and yet so cunningly clever, it's a truly worthy cinematic experience. Sergeant Howie (played adeptly by Edward Woodward) sets off to a remote Scottish Island to follow up on a 'missing child' case, having received a letter from one of the islanders about her disappearance. Right from the get go we are treated to the outlandish ways of the island folk and let's just say, the straight laced Howie is not exactly welcomed with open arms. It soon becomes apparent that the islanders actively pursue a pagan belief system and are immersed in an unusual lifestyle that involves the worship of nature and pagan Celtic gods, and an open reverence for fecundity, sexuality and fertility - this totally outrages the conventional, god-fearing Sergeant and the more he sees, the more frustrated and irritated he becomes. Imagine his horror at the continual cavorting, sudden bursts of jaunty folk music , and elaborate (and somewhat explicit) fertility rites.As Howie goes about his business he soon finds, much to his chagrin, that no one is willing to help him in his quest to find the missing girl and that no one will even openly admit to knowing her. This stonewalling, combined with his continual exposure to the islanders' hedonism, just compounds his intolerance and revulsion which I believe is neatly summed up when he hollers at the top of his lungs 'Heathens!, bloody heathens!'. He quickly learns that all residents of Summerisle (including himself) must defer to the charismatic Lord Summerisle (played with panache by Christopher Lee) and although this 'leader' isn't 'worshipped' as such, it is evident that he 'runs the show'.The artful depiction of ancient British customs, celebrations and costumes are a huge component of Wicker Man, not to mention the islanders' random eruptions into bawdy folk songs. The movie appears to have been casted with a range of unskilled, 'wooden' actors who are not altogether believable and seem big on 'over acting' but, as the plot unfolds, you may well change your opinion as to their 'acting skills'. There are though, without doubt, some genuinely bad actors and some painful attempts at the Scottish accent (apparently the Landlord's daughter's 'accent' was so heinous they ended up dubbing her lines). There are also many seemingly over the top, and obvious, metaphors (think: dead child cakes, numerous phallic symbols, dead hare in a casket, lingering shots of the sun etc).After initially sympathizing with Sergeant Howie and the way he is ridiculed and lied to by the wilfully uncooperative islanders, one begins to finds his staunch, prudish, celibate and rigid brand of Christianity somewhat objectionable, and his intolerance of the islander's customs and beliefs, particularly narrow minded. The juxtaposition of Howie's 'god fearing' ways and the islanders ebullient and, on face value, 'cheerful' worship of nature, is cleverly enacted but, as the movie plays out, the portrayal of these contrary beliefs beg questions such as, is this an indictment of religion (including but not necessarily limited to the Sergeant's and the islanders)? Is it solely an indictment of paganism? Is it pro Christian and anti heathen? And, if that last theory applies, why wasn't Howie depicted in a more sympathetic light? Other interesting elements of the movie include the fact everything we are presented with is seen only through the eyes of Howie so one does start to wonder if his biased, prejudiced view of the pagan folks actually colours what he (and in turn we) see. This notion is exemplified when the Sergeant is in his room at the inn and, in the next room, the Landlord's daughter is stark naked, dancing around in a highly suggestive manner and repeatedly slapping the wall (yes\u0085.. that bit was weird). Howie leans up against the wall and you see his perspiration and pained expression of unfulfilled desire as he battles with this 'sinful' temptation. However, you then realize that a) he didn't know she was naked, and b) he didn't know there was 'dirty dancing' going on. Was it all just a figment of his imagination? And if so, how much else of what he saw on that island was conjured up by his mind's eye?.In conclusion, if you want to watch a well thought out, creative, totally non-generic movie that may generate much discussion - and if you appreciate strange, off the wall and sometimes bizarre film-making - oh yes, and if you can handle an eyeful of naked, nubile young women prancing and dancing around - you're gonna love it!",

            "content": "Anthony Shaffer's THE WICKER MAN has become over the years a cult classic of modern horror due to the fact that while it never points at anything other than what is on the surface, it taps into tradition on both sides of religion. On one side, there is the faith that we've come to know as Christianity (although it could also be Catholicism, if you will). Sergeant Neil Howie (Edward Woodward) is at this end of the spectrum. His devoutness is quite strong, but even then he's not a Bible-thumper nor a promoter of the Word. On the other side is the entire community known as Summerisle, a place founded by the forefathers of Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), people who have joined forces to create a society in which paganism is the norm. For Howie, a man who represents the uninitiated, their constant cheerfulness as they dance around the May pole and sing folk songs; their casual yet ritualistic approach to sex; their beliefs and education system brings forth a shock. He is clearly on foreign land, and his search for the missing girl he has been summoned to find will lead him to a surprising discovery.Even then, the question that arises from what the end result is: will Summerisle's offering truly bring a successful harvest? Their last harvest was a failure -- crops did not grow -- and once the question is verbalized by Howie himself, for a second, Lord Summerisle's eyes fall to the ground, downcast. It's a reminder of a near identical scene in a similar story, Shirley Jackson's \"The Lottery\". Questions arise throughout snippets of narration as the preparation for the lottery goes on, if this is all necessary. One person answers that it's been discontinued in neighboring towns. Another one blames the new generation doesn't respect tradition. And Tess Hutchinson, like Howie, comes to realize too late what the lottery really is. Like Hutchinson, Howie allows himself to get drawn in the seduction that is fleshed out by Willow's (Britt Ekland) erotic dance as well as his moral sense of duty to save the life of this young girl. And like Hutchinson, Howie fails to see the extremism within the hedonism of Summerisle.Mislabeled as a horror movie, THE WICKER MAN is far from it, even though the ending is what people will debate. Cleverly drawing the viewer in for a meandering investigation, it misleads the viewer as it blithely throws its secret onto the foreground more than once and even adds several musical numbers that are sweetly ominous in their own way. Strong actors hold the movie up high and misdirect the viewer even more, thinking they will see a dead-on horror film: Christopher Lee, a veteran of horror films, plays against type as a congenial man with that baritone voice that commands attention (and even sings a song). Ingrid Pitt has a small part. Edward Woodward, a non-horror actor, is tragic as the man who has fallen in an elaborate trap. And then there is Britt Ekland, beautiful for her time, playing a part that shows off her beauty, and Diane Cilento, who is as cheerful as the rest of Summerisle, with those staring eyes that point at a dark inside. This, precisely, is the heart of the people in Summerisle: zealots who portray a sunny disposition, but who are corrupted at a soul level.",

Of course, if you're quick, you'll catch all the little things along the way.It concerns a call that the mainland police received about a missing girl on an island off the Scotland coast. Enter Sgt. Howie (Woodward) and his attempt to interrogate the people on the island as to the whereabouts of the girl. For the most part, they are not only uncooperative, but rather amused by his manner and his determination to get to the truth and by certain remarks he makes about his own beliefs.If you've never seen this movie, you should rent it right now. Considered by many as the \"Citizen Kane\" of horror movies, it leaves you thinking about it long after it's over, and that's even creepier.",

It would have to be a thriller because there is not the slightest hint of horror in the film, with perhaps the exception of the hero's perception of his situation at the end.The film has an amateurish and slapped together feel to it. The music, which sometimes has characters bursting into song, is inappropriate and distracting. Neither cinematography or sound rise above an amateur level.Edward Woodward is excellent as the obsessive policeman sent to investigate the disappearance of a young girl from a remote Scottish island. He soon finds that the island's inhabitants are, without exception, lascivious and perverted ... and liars.Christopher Lee is terrible in the role of the island's lead citizen and benefactor. Poor Lee is further handicapped by a series of awful costumes, hair styles and wigs. One of the latter appears to have been directly stolen from Cher. Lee is not alone in suffering in idiotic costumes. Virtually the entire cast is forced to don appalling get-ups before this show is done.Supporting and character roles are the most fetching in this film, and an ample helping of female nudity serves to boost excitement during otherwise boring moments.Without revealing the finale, some questions come to mind. How did the islanders know the policeman that would be sent would be, believe it or not, a virgin? How did they know that he would not re-board his plane and leave after the first few blind leads? Portrayed as a upstanding cop, why is he constantly threatening people, breaking and entering, and trying to force his moral standards on the citizenry? All in all, a diverting way to spend an hour and a half, the Wicker Man fails on more levels than it succeeds upon. Hardly qualifying as a cult film, Wicker Man is a mild film about a cult.",

            "content": "If you haven't seen the film then by no means read this review, since knowing the ending beforehand largely spoils the effect. However for those of you who have seen it or know the story, here goes:This was an excellent film and part of its excellence was its upending of so many movie clich\u00e9s. One huge clich\u00e9 is that the hero of the piece, (Edward Woodward) could take on an army and win against outrageous odds. The hero is quite literally toast and that comes as a complete surprise to those who have no inkling of how it ends. The viewer is teased into thinking he is going to be smashed on the rocks below but an even more horrifying ending is in store as the title character, not seen until the last minute or two of the film finally appears. One might, based on so many other films one has seen, expect that the SWAT team would arrive by parachute and put the fire out and arrest all concerned. That this does not happen is about as gripping an ending as one could devise. The amiable and gentle folk of the island have all gone collectively bonkers and it isn't just from an excess of drinking. And how many old inbred aristocrats such as played by Christopher Lee have we read, seen, or heard about? Well-bred, high born, and flat out insane? Islands of course are famous in literature for being dens of wickedness hidden from the view of the larger world. From Papillion to Lord of the Flies to Jurassic Park, they are special, rather magical places and this one is no different. At the same time it makes paganism look like fun. There is a delightful playfulness in the spirit of the islanders. It seems almost a satire on the clash between paganism and the early missionaries of the Church. The music is wonderful. One wonders if there was ever a sound track album that came out of this film. It seemed at certain points on the verge of becoming a musical, a musical horror film the likes of which had never been seen before Sweeny Todd.The cultish eroticism in the film did not distract from the story and did not seem in the end, gratuitous although it might have easily been so. There was a kind of sixties flavor to the weirdness, when people went native and dropped out, adopting very strange ideas indeed. One thinks of Charles Manson, Jonestown, Scientology, and Heaven's gate. How anyone could have hoped to remake this classic adequately is beyond me.",

A phenomenal performance as always, Woodward is an unrecognized talent in British acting. Woodward was in middle-age when this was produced, and thus missed his shot at stardom, much to our loss.This movie is a harrowing, bizarre exploration into the man's preoccupation with the occult, a juxtaposition of the Christian religion vs. The earthly religions.The production is rich in symbolism, history, setting and iconography.

            "content": "Gruesome and not all together accurate, depiction of the Old Pagan Ways, but beautiful in some ways, nonetheless.As a Pagan, I must say that I was not surprised to find that Pagans were depicted as the villains here. Such is the way of man, to fear what he does not understand, and to seek to destroy that which he fears.Other than that one gripe, I found the whole human sacrifice ploy to be indicative of the condition about which I first spoke. All religions of old practiced human sacrifice at one time or another, including the religion of choice of mainstream America; Christianity. I found it a convenient and contrived device to use here, after such beauty was displayed. But perhaps that was the intent of the director; to lull us with the wonders of Pagan revelry and then murder that lulled sense of placation with the horrors that follow.Whichever the case, it worked. This movie is a beautiful glimpse into the world which was, and then you are plunged into the darker side of that same world.As Satanists/Luciferians are considered to be a Christian heresy, so is the type of rite featured at the end of this movie, to the Pagan community at large. The burning of the \"stuffy guy,\" \"corn man,\" \"wicker man,\" or \"John Barleycorn\" is a beautiful and sacred tradition among many in the Pagan fold, as there are as many denominations of Paganism as there are in Christianity. The corn man was filled with animals raised as sacrament to the God of the Hunt. Fresh fruits and grains (the best of the previous year's harvest) were placed into the corn man's extremities, he was erected and burned as a burnt offering to the Goddess as a wedding present. She marries the God on Beltane, or May Day if you prefer.Macy's still has a beautiful May Day parade, and many schools still celebrate May Day with festivals; some still featuring the May Pole.Just as there are fall festivals, there are still spring festivals the world over. Most do not remember why, but some of us do.I found the duplicity of this particular group of Pagans to be delightfully dark and highly enjoyable; sneaky, underhanded and just wrong, but enjoyable to watch.But if you are not of the Pagan Folds, never fear. This movie does not glamorize Paganism. To the contrary, it drags us back to the Dark Ages when human sacrifice was an acceptable means of offering, and human life was not yet considered sacred. So it will sit well with your fine sensibilities and not compromise your self-righteous indignations.Watch it for yourself to witness one of the most beautifully dark movies to ever be committed to film.It rates a 9.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",

They must be considered lost for ever. However, this print was found in the Harvard Film Archives, and thus is acclaimed like that of a lost, and newly found, episode of 'Doctor Who'.Added material takes this version of the film to 94 minutes. It opens in a church, with star Edward Woodward, singing a hymn. However, this reviewer inwardly groaned, as the film quality looked poor, with the colour all washed out. However film quality picked up with the next scene, and quality remained good to OK at least, through the rest of the film, with very little exception. Some later scenes were shot in that very rich vivid colour that is just so emblematic of the seventies.After the short church scene, as we get the opening credits, we see Edward Woodward take off in a plane and fly to a Scottish island called Summerisle. On landing he is not made welcome but rather is told that the island is private property. Woodward declares that he is Sergeant Neil Howie of the West Highland Police Force and that he is here to investigate the case of a missing child.Sgt Howie stays the night in the local inn. He is not impressed with the hospitality, nor the rowdy locals. He realizes the culture of the island is very different from his own. His culture shock deepens as he visits the local school, and finally, when he meets Lord Summerisle, JP, owner of the island, and somewhat of a feudal lord, he finally has revealed to him, the full history of the island.The audience, in these encounters, enjoys the obvious comedy, as the good Christian policeman, becomes increasingly shocked by his encounters, until finally engaging in verbal cut and thrust with a rather louche Lord Summerisle, played by Christopher Lee.Sgt Howie, despite all the obstacles he encounters, is determined to pursue his investigation of the missing child.There is much music in the film. All very appropriate. Mostly a lot of folk music, lots of singing, but also a little piping too. In a recent interview, a musician described how he was required to beat the drum to help Brit Ekland, with the rhythm, in her famous musical number. He went on to say that filming took all day, with the naked Miss Ekland, wrapped in a towel between takes. The musician stated that Miss Ekland demanded, and got, a bottom-double, whilst he himself spend the day with Miss Ekland, handing the said towel to her, and taking it from her, between takes. \"I have had worse jobs\" he drolly commented.Principle stars of the film are ably supported by Diane Cilento, Gerry Cowper and Ingrid Pitt. However my own personal favourite is the Gardener/Gravedigger, played lustily, to the hilt, by Aubrey Morris.A young couple sat next to me as the film started, but left after about half-an-hour. For young lovers, with low-boredom thresholds, it should be stated that this is not an all-action or slasher-type of horror. Rather it is slow-burning character-driven suspense film. If this appeals to you, if you wish to find out if Herodotus is right that custom is king, if you are looking for a raunchy sexy horror with lots and lots of lusty singing, then this classic cult horror is the film for you. 9/10.",

I am actually more annoyed by the film than I like it. Because I see a huge opportunity missed here. This film could have been a great criticism of religions. But instead, it chooses the opposite almost. Although it is never spelled directly, our protagonist is portrayed as a moral model, thus Christianity as the true religion as opposed to paganism. In one scene, our good christian policeman, fully uniformed in his officers, scatters some pagan symbolism or offering in anger, then proceeds to create a makeshift cross from some pieces of wood on the same altar. How dumb! It could have really been a masterpiece if its message had matched its weirdness. One other major flaw of the film is that the protagonists behaviour doesn't match the situations that he is in. He was in numerous instances that he should have been alarmed and felt thereatened and unsafe. But he chooses to peacefully sleep when a lot of suspicious things going on around him, instead of trying to call for help. Again, dumb! And when I say dumb, I don't mean the character, he is dumb too of course, as a result. But at the end, the filmed served its purpose as a horror movie and it is really a different and weird film, I can't complain about any clich\u00e9s and that is saying a lot when it's the horror genre.

Most of it can be summarized by the simple question: \"Where is Rowan Morrison?\", the good cop Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) keeps asking, first of this person, then of that group, then of some other person, over and over and over, through two-thirds of the film. Then rather suddenly toward the end, the story's underlying premise becomes apparent, but then the ending, too, gets stretched out. There's no gradual escalation in the story, just a seemingly endless loop of repetitious plot for over an hour, followed by a long, drawn-out ending.Once we approach the end, we can see that the film has some thematic value, or at least it did back when it was made. But with ever-increasing technological interconnectedness the story's underlying theme is trending outdated.Even for 1973, the script is not well thought out, with huge lapses in logic and some plot holes involving both Howie and the residents. Further, I find the residents foppish, self-satisfied, and annoyingly blithe. None of the characters are worth caring about.Cinematography, casting, and acting are generally credible, though Woodward's performance at the end is melodramatic; perhaps that was the Director's fault. There is no score. The various songs are unmemorable.This story could have been told in thirty minutes, with the first twenty devoted to investigative questions and the final ten devoted to the ending, with its genuinely unique visuals of the wicker figure high on a hillside against the backdrop of the setting sun. The visuals here are captivating. But the script is poorly written, and the overall story, and its attendant theme, is fast becoming irrelevant here in the twenty-first century.",

Woodward (like all the leads) is no born-Scot but manages to look every inch the pious God-fearing Highlander, respectful of God to the extent that on his first night he can resist (but only just) the lustrous attractions of a sensually inflamed Britt Ekland (for the second time in British films, requiring to arouse herself in little or no clothes - remember the phone conversation with Michael Caine in \"Get Carter\") to save himself for his fianc\u00e9e on the mainland.We, the viewers, like Woodward's Neil Howie character, are at first bemused and later repulsed by the pagan rituals and beliefs of the islanders which, although commonplace to them, run to strange dressings-up, nude dancing, very odd song lyrics and all the way ultimately to human sacrifice. The locals see nothing unusual in this, Christianity having been long-banished as the island's main religion. The acting of the two male leads is excellent, Woodward earnest but twitchy, Christopher Lee as the Lord of the Manor and ringleader of the rituals, debonair but menacing. It's one of the latter's best roles with nary a fang in sight. I'm not quite sure I believed Britt Ekland's Highland brogue but Diane Cilento (ex-wife of Sean Connery) is prim and sinister by turns as the local teacher who acts as Lee's amanuensis. The rest of the genuinely Scottish cast (I know, I'm Scottish and recognise many of their names and faces from TV and film) create a sense of foreboding throughout like a Greek chorus, by turns donning outlandish fertility traits and masks and droning a menacing hum as the mob gathers Woodward to his fate.There are so many weird and wonderful scenes here, obviously Ekland's famous nude dance for one, but also others like a child mischievously feigning death falling out of a wardrobe as Woodward searches for the missing girl, a mother making her daughter put a live frog in her mouth to cure a sore throat, the teenage girls nude dancing, right out of a Matisse or Fergusson (Scottish colourist) painting, before the fiery conclusion with Woodward inside the Wicker Man atop the hillside as the sun goes down.I'd read many conflicting accounts of this film but was delighted I ignored them and was rewarded with a movie experience that I'll not easily forget and with every other year bringing to light some disturbing story of a weird religious cult somewhere, this film will stay relevant for a long time to come, I don't doubt.",

Euripide's The Bacchae and the Eleusis rites, both minor and major rites. In that sense, this is more than a thriller or a horror movie, and that is wath it makes so unique, so special, and so impressive. In that way we have to understand what all the people call \"pagan cult\". The symbolism of Eleusis rites appears since the arrival to the island and all wath happen. Is not a casual thing that the island calls Summerisland, and that the future victim, Sergeant Neil Howie, need to come by his own will to be part ot a voluntary sacrifice, instead of beign abducted. Agrarian symbolism includes the way in Summerisland beer is made, and all the film atmosphere always remember us that is an island basically full of young girls, who seduce the newcomer in order to conducted to his ritual sacrifice, exactly as happen with Pentheus, who want to know the name and the rites of the new arrival god, Dyonisus, who needs the sacrifice in order to succeed. In the Teban myth, girls on an island sacrifice Pentheus, exactly as in film Sergeant Neil Howie is finally burnt out on an agrarian rite of purification.A supreme masterpiece that goes beyond conventional film genres. One of the greatest british films ever, in my opinion. A must see!",

            "content": "The story of the making of The Wicker Man is as horrifying as anything in the film itself; British Lion, the company responsible for producing it, underwent a change of management that lead to the film being partly disowned and re-edited as a \"B\" movie in support to Don't Look Now, and after a modestly remunerative run vanished almost without trace in America. It was seen as unmarketable and tales of shady dealings in connection with the movie have filtered through the years to become the stuff of legend. Even poor old Rod Stewart was said to have tried to buy the film so he could destroy the negative - he was supposed to object to the nude scenes of his then girl friend Brit Ekland! That fact that it turned out to be untrue (Stewart didn't even know she was in it!) is all part of the film's fascinating history.The film's original negative is now lost, either inadvertently destroyed or, if you believe the conspiracy theories, buried under the M3 motorway!Ah, yes, the film itself. Anthony Shaffer's screen play introduces us to Sergeant Neil Howie (Edward Woodward), a Scottish police offer who receives a letter from one of the inhabitants of Summerisle, an island in the gulf stream off the west coast, claiming that a young girl has disappeared. Arriving on the island, Howie, a committed Christian, discovers the occupants have reverted to Paganism, re-introduced in the 19th century by the grandfather of the current lord of island (Christopher Lee). And it dawns on Howie that the young girl may have been abducted in preparation for a ritual sacrifice...To go too much into the plot would spoil the film, for it relies on a shift of the viewer's perceptions (not a twist as such)to experience the full genius of The Wicker Man. What we have here is a virtually unique film that dares to be different. It only has a toe in the horror genre, and is at heart a film that examines belief systems (Christianity versus Paganism) and their effect upon the followers of these faiths. Thus the viewers's interpretation of events is often called into question, viewed through the filter of our own beliefs. Once seen it's a film that's impossible to forget.Thanks to the brilliant playing of Edward Woodward Howie never comes across as a prig, but someone who finds the Pagan tradition on the island so totally at odds with his beliefs he can not accept the truth of the situation until it is too late. Christopher Lee also gives a fine performance, and the cast is rounded out by Brit Ekland, Ingrid Pitt and notable British character actors like Aubrey Morris. It's a film of conflict and curiosity, and the ending is as horrifying as anything in cinema. A near masterpiece, only Robin Hardy's rather clumsy direction spoils the proceedings. The story and the theme are all. I refuse to watch the re-make. Why bother when the original is so compelling?",

            "content": "THE WICKER MANAspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: MonoA deeply religious police sergeant (Edward Woodward, in a note-perfect performance) searches for a missing schoolgirl on a remote Scottish island, where he uncovers a Pagan society rooted in old superstitions and the worship of vengeful gods. First-time director Robin Hardy and acclaimed writer Anthony Shaffer (twin brother of Peter, and author of FRENZY and SLEUTH, the latter based on his stageplay) took aim at organized religion with this unusual entry, which opened at the tail-end of Hammer's Gothic cycle and quickly vanished from sight, only to re-emerge as a favorite of cult movie fans everywhere. To the accompaniment of Paul Giovanni's haunting score - comprising variations on traditional songs and folk music - THE WICKER MAN depicts an isolated community steeped in ancient beliefs and ruled with deceptive benevolence by a patriarchal figure (Christopher Lee, in unusually subtle form) whom the script suggests is a monstrous con man, maintaining the island's customs not through genuine convictions, but because the islanders - all of them true disciples of The Cause - simply know no other way.The central mystery (Woodward's search for the missing girl) is genuinely engrossing, and the bawdy songs which greet the sergeant's arrival are soon replaced by an earthy sensuality as the true extent of the islanders' belief in regenerative powers - divorced from traditional notions of 'morality' - become apparent. Lee's assessment of God verges on blasphemy (\"He had His chance and... blew it!\"), but ultimately, neither Christianity or Paganism emerges with any credit from the devastating finale. There's real magic in every frame of this extraordinary film, though it's clearly not for everyone: For some, the careful pace and deliberate absence of familiar horror motifs may seem a little long-winded, even dull, though everyone else will be enchanted by this unique, one-of-a-kind movie. Most viewers were introduced to the film via the 88-minute 'theatrical print' - roundly condemned by Hardy and Shaffer - simply because it was the only available version for many years. However, despite the filmmakers' protestations to the contrary, it's still a remarkable experience. The 'definitive' 100-minute version underlines many of Shaffer's themes with greater clarity, making it a revelation for anyone who's only ever seen the theatrical print or the 95-minute variant screened on British television during the 1990's. There's a few bits and pieces in the 88m version which are exclusive to that print, and Woodward's encounter with the doctor in the longer version (39m into the picture) opens a little too abruptly, indicating an apparent loss of footage. Also missing from the 100m print is the animated 'sun-god' which appears after the closing credits in the 95m version, filling the screen before retreating into darkness. The loss of this brief, iconic fragment is inexplicable.",

I live less than 10 miles from Culzean Castle (home of Lord Summerisle), and know Kirkcudbrightshire very well indeed. I have stood on the very cliff at Burrowhead and watched the sun dip into the sea. Living as I do in relatively close proximity to many of the locations I am looking forward a visit this summer to Plockton on the western mainland opposite the Isle of Skye and to explore and soak up the atmosphere of the place.

It is not frightening and has no horror themes, but unsettling the entire time. It is also said to be a musical, but the singing colors the atmosphere rather than telling the story in a traditional musical sense. And some of the creepiest moments in the film involve the songs and texts, some of which are traditional folk songs.This kind of film is very rare. It is rough around the edges, but also very sophisticated. The kinds of scenes being so indulgent with time and detail showing ritual, especially with long sections music and dance, are something I cannot imagine being accepted again by today's expectations.The only drawbacks I found was that the style of cutting was sometimes a little bit jerky. Some of the acting, not so much from the main actors but from the smaller parts, was pretty over-the-top and could have been more effective if they acted a bit more normally.Also, it is perhaps a little bit dated being released in the 70's - There is a lot of nudity and all of it is female nudity, which doesn't really make sense as it really should include both sexes.But all in all really worth a watch if you don't mind something a little bit weird and unconventional!",

Into this world comes the devout Christian, Captain Howie, played with appropriate horror by Edward Woodward, looking for a missing girl. What he finds is a date with The Wicker Man. This is very hard film to peg. It has horror, comedy, drama, and lots of singing. But it is not easily ignored. If you can make it past the subject matter, I had no problem with that, you will find one of the greatest movies of the last forty years. It deserves a place among such uneasily defined movies as The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Dog Day Afternoon, and A Clockwork Orange.The amazing score by Paul Giavanni is one of the films many wonders. It is full of old fashioned bawdy folk music(Corn Rigs, The Tinker of Rye, and Gently Johnny), ritual songs(Maypole and Chop), and pub songs like The Landlord's Daughter. They can stand on their own, because they are made in a style that is sustained outside of the movie. They are not specifically tied to it, but they make the movie better.The one thing that holds the movie from instant greatness is the title. It's a good title, but the wicker man does not appear until the end of the movie. It is not the essential drive of the movie. Titling it The Wicker Man makes it one of those surprise ending movies, which it is in a way, but it shouldn't be thought of that way. The whole movie is good and it's about the whole movie, which is about the island. Summerisle is a much better title. Nobody is waiting throughout the film for what the wicker man is and the previews would be about the island, rather than giving away the ending. Nonetheless, The Wicker Man is a unique experience that is still fun, alive, and daring, even thirty-four years later.",

            "content": "This is far more than just a review. I need to compare because prior to the newest remake of The Wicker Man I had never heard of this film. After seeing the very decent and harshly panned remake starring Nicholas Cage I knew I HAD to see this \"glorious\", \"terrific\", \"classic\" original that everyone was raving about. Now I won't pretend the film wasn't good, the original Anthony Shaffer's The Wicker Man is a decent and disturbing occult drama. I can't say thriller because there isn't near the thrill that the remake had to it. This original was more of a dramatic, and disturbing look at a very disturbed little island. This is where the remake absolutely trounced the original because Neil LaBute's Wicker Man had so much more depth and background information and left no major plot holes like the original does. Why does Sergeant Howie (the exact person they needed for the sacrifice) come to the island?? Who sent the letter?? Why was he sent alone?? All these questions are dealt with in the remake with more a secure story and background. Still Anthony Shaffer's The Wicker Man takes the cake on twisted. The people on this island are not just cult freaks and cut off from the mainland...they are utterly and completely insane. This is proved with the very strange sudden burst into song making it into a semi-musical complete with naked dancing and slapping their rear ends while they dance. The film has a very dark and disturbing undertone for certain but it's claim to fame is questionable?? Edward Woodward plays Sergeant Howie, and absolutely impresses!! Woodward is terrific as the morally secure, determined police officer. I would say that he does a significant better job at the part than his predecessor Nicholas Cage. Much like the remake Woodward truly is the star and everyone else is a supporting cast, some more than others. The beautiful Britt Ekland is thrown in there as a seductive temptress and does a decent job in that role. Irene Sunters plays the mother of the missing girl and her role hardly takes her from her kitchen but she still manages to come across as disturbed and creepy so kudos to her. And legendary actor Christopher Lee makes an appearance in the latter half of the film as the mysterious leader Lord Summerisle. Lee has a small part but he definitely adds to the cast and does a terrific job as Summerisle. The debate between Lee and Woodward over their \"pagan\" rituals is quite interesting.The film is not mind blowing although it is ripe with culture of the British which is great for them. I can see it being a highlight of their movie making history because it's intriguing and haunting. The Irish or English ballads that are used throughout the film absolutely chill you to the bone and are reminiscent of Simon and Garfunkle. Director Robin Hardy who never really went anywhere after this film does a really great job capturing the beauty of this island and the people and their foreign ways. But the film doesn't give you enough answers to all the peculiar questions. The story feels half fulfilled and the ending instead of being a thrill turns out to be disappointing because the questions are just not answered. For that reason the original falls short of being as good as or better than the recent remake. I know that's not a popular opinion and I might get booed for it but the remake had so much more of a story and besides the fact that the depth of the story was added there was so much that they kept faithful to the original film which is why I don't understand the outcry of hatred towards the remake. They were almost identical!! EXCEPT the new Wicker Man made so much more sense because the background information provided and the spin on the story. Either way both are worth seeing one is a cult classic and the other should be seen to compare. Definitely unique and strange film made by the British and possibly one of their best. 6/10",

And how many controversies would have this film raised had it been made today? A remake was done in 2006\u2796is it as good as the original?What begins like a delectable musical, with a song about wheat and barley playing over an aerial photograph of the beautiful Scottish land- and seascapes, soon turns into something as subversive as possible. The \"landlord's daughter\" song, couples having sex in the open, the May Day \"tree-man-woman-man-grave\" song, young schoolgirls learning about \"phallic\" symbols from a stern school teacher, naked pregnant women dancing around and jumping over a bonfire so that their babies come out healthy, a live frog being pushed into a little girl's mouth (and then taken out a moment later) to cure her sore throat, the school teacher telling a devout Christian police officer that the concept of reincarnation is more acceptable to children than the concept of resurrection because reincarnation doesn't demand much of \"childish imagination\" as much as the resurrection of a \"rotting\" dead body does\u2796THE WICKER MAN is a brave and terrific attack on the concept of organised religion and making one's own choice in the matter of faith.The acting is top notch. If Edward Woodward is earnest as Sergeant Neil Howie, an officer of the Mainland Police and a devout Christian, investigating the disappearance of a young girl on the island of Summerisle; then Christopher Lee is terrifyingly sinister as Lord Summerisle, a self-proclaimed master of everyone and everything on the island of Summerisle. I would especially mention Britt Eklund, who brings in a throwing-caution-to-the-wind and I-don't-care kind of sex appeal as Willow, the innkeeper's daughter. What I liked most about THE WICKER MAN is that despite being a horror film, there are no visible elements of horror in the film; yet, the film is so atmospheric, I had this feeling that something was definitely not right on the island of Summerisle. Like I mentioned earlier, the film starts like a beautifully shot musical set in a picturesque location and progresses like one. Even the subversive scenes - scenes that powerfully challenge one's faith - are accompanied by songs\u2796beautifully rendered songs which are, again, of a subversive nature.There are three films I am really thankful I was able to see: Pier Paolo Pasolini's 'Salo', Ruggero Deodato's 'Cannibal Holocaust', and this one, Robin Hardy's THE WICKER MAN. These films are shocking, no doubt, but they also raise some important questions. THE WICKER MAN is a must-watch and I am happy that a film like this was made.And this just occurred to me so I am editing my review a bit (I would still give THE WICKER MAN 10 out of 10 because I found it to be a brave and well-made film). What was the actual intention of the makers of this film? Did they want to push the view that anyone who practises the so-called \"pagan\" rituals and does not conform to Christianity is evil?",

            "content": "I hear the whole \"Old horror movies were scary, new horror movies are just gore-fests!\" argument so often that I'm pretty much desensitized to the utter stupidity of it. For one, people said Night of the Living Dead (1968) was just as excessively gory in its time as people say Saw IV (2007) is excessively gory today. There is just as much sex/nudity in The Wicker Man (1973) as in Hostel (2005), if not more. New or old, movies pushed the level of shock value in their respective generations\u0097that has never changed. Being someone who's seen a large amount of older horror films, I can say firsthand that the majority of them are pure laugh-out-loud cheese horror, and their fans are blinded by nostalgia. I can count the amount of horror movies that have genuinely frightened me on one hand, and not a single one them was over 15-years-old. You're reading the review of a horror fan that has actually grown up and matured with the times. Not a horror fan that is stuck with old horror movies the same way a teenager is stuck with the blanket he's had since early childhood. I realize that modern horror films don't just dibble around with cheesy monsters and ghosts; they add realism and true emotion. Am I saying everything from the 2000s has been gold? Ha! Read my reviews and you'll see I hate 95% of it. But that doesn't make old horror movies superior, because they're just as bad for their own reasons. Namely cheese. But despite everything I just said, The Wicker Man was one of the few movies\u0097modern or aged\u0097that is genuinely deserving of the hype behind it. Mostly.I'll start with the things The Wicker Man got right. While the movie was not absolutely terrifying by any means, I agree with the reviews that state there is a level of apprehension that is prevalent from open to close. The atmosphere is not perfect, but it is slightly better than average. The entire film carries a surrealism feel, but it isn't really surrealism. The use of colors is very neat to watch. I put the art direction far above that of Suspiria (1977), simply because it's a lot less over-the-top and cheesy. The acting and direction are both fairly well-done for its time. The Wicker Man, for the most part, avoids everything that made the other movies from its time so cheesy and laughable.The story is very well played out, even if it is a little thin. There is a definitive mystery behind it, and it's pretty immersive, for the most part. I'm someone who is easily bored with movies, but this held my attention to the end\u0097mostly. There are a lot of repetitious scenes that had no point, but the atmosphere and color-work made up for it.The director seemed to be inserting some idea about religious extremists on both sides of the spectrum, but I really failed to see his point. I give him props for not bashing us over the head with a clich\u00e9 moral, however, and that is where The Wicker Man really becomes superior to other films like it.Now the things The Wicker Man failed at. Above everything else, as interesting as the story is, there just isn't enough here to stretch out for that long of a time. It's a single-line plot with no subplots, and when it finally reaches the end, the only thing I really thought was: \"Well . . . that was pretty cute.\" Why? Because it played out a like a children's fable, and lacked any maturity of an adult piece. Get rid of the nudity and it could pass as an Alice in Wonderland wannabe. Maybe that assessment is a little too harsh, but that's really what I thought directly when it was over. It all plays out way too tritely for me to take seriously. All the answers to the main character's questions just fall in his lap with no effort from him whatsoever. He just stands there and people tell him what he wants to know. It's really sad to see such great atmosphere go to waste due to poor, childish storytelling.Overall, though, I really liked The Wicker Man for what it was. It was a cute morality tale with some nice visuals. But it's ludicrous for people to state this as the most terrifying movie of all time, or even one of them. It has a dull sense of dread, but I'd hardly call that true terror. It has some memorable scenes, but I'd hardly call it a masterpiece because of them. It borders a lot on take-it-or-leave-it, but I'm going to say this. If you're a modern horror fan who thinks everything from the past is cheese, check this out. It may challenge your opinion on the subject. If you're a horror fan stuck in the past, just get over this movie. It's not THAT special.4/10",

Watching it again recently for the second time only confirms my new beliefs that \"The Wicker Man\" is a masterpiece and a well-deserved classic.It's a slow burner with an extremely, increasingly intriguing mystery surrounding a missing girl. From the minute Edward Woodward steps onto the island it's obvious that something isn't right with these people, and they're hiding something, though you're not entirely sure why. It's a film about encounters really, that don't make any sense, and are so unnatural that they turn out to actually be quite frightening. \"The Wicker Man\" has a very imaginative and solid screenplay, that clearly has had a lot of thought being put into it, with its creepy religious symbolism and ultimately shocking finale.Edward Woodward is the only normal man we see throughout the whole film, and like \"Shutter Island\" he can't leave, and so their is a great atmosphere of claustrophobia and also a coldness from the awe-inspiring scenery. The songs are also unsettling, if not a bit overlong, they seem to be cheery and well-practised, just something very unnatural about it all. \"The Wicker Man\" also has some fantastic iconic moments, not just the final scene, but throughout their seems to be moments that will always stay with you.Christopher Lee does a find job, also dawning an hilarious wig resembling a mild Patsy from \"Absolutely Fabulous\". He also has some classic lines and will probably be one of the most memorable characters of all time. In my opinion \"The Wicker Man\" was way ahead of its time, and the ending is no exception. When we meet \"The Wicker Man\" a sheet of sheer terror certainly does cover you. It is monstrously creepy, and will probably stay with me for as long as live. Unless I get Alzheimer's and forget EVERYTHING! \"The Wicker Man\" is an essential horror classic. You might not appreciate the first time, but as time goes on, you won't be able to put away that image of \"The Wicker Man\" which ultimately leads up to what probably is the best twist and finale to any film in history. It's the definition of chilling, and also you feel a lot of sympathy. Everything about it is unsettling and gripping. This is true horror.",

            "content": "This is a great little film, which proves you dont need a bucket load of money, or star value (well A list anyway) to make a genuine classic.Part of the mystique surrounding this film is I believe it didn't exactly set the world alight when it was released (I could be wrong here.) Theres so much to like about this film I found I have revisited it several times over the years, it reeks atmosphere without any contrivance or tricks. I think this has alot to do with the plot, the Scottish island location and the pagan overtones that lie at the heart of the movie (and the celtic/folk soundtrack as well). It revolves around a devout Christian police inspector investigating the disappearance of a young girl on a remote Scottish Isle, where the inhabitants seem to have reverted to practising pre-Christian paganism.Its got afew names in it Britt Ekland as the village barmaid, Christopher Lee as the Lord of Summerisle , Ingrid Pitt (as the town librarian!) and in the main role Edward Woodward. Edward Woodward is solid in the role as the driven pious policeman looking a missing girl.The rest of the cast is adequate without shining but I dont think this matters because the main purpose of the cast of Islanders is to weave a air of mystery through which Sergeant Howie must negotiate. The much heralded plot twist at the end of the film is a genuinely great one. Its organic to the plot of the film and doesnt seem in anyway contrived. The ending is particularly haunting & eerie & has stayed in my mind since I first saw the film. A genuine cult classic that probably deserves wide viewing even outside confines of the art/cult video shelf.",

            "content": "A righteous police officer investigating the disappearance of a young girl comes into conflict with the unusual residents of a secluded Scottish isle in this unsettling, intelligent chiller. Brought to the island of Summerisle by an anonymous letter, Edward Woodward's constable is surprised to discover that the island's population suspiciously denies the missing girl's very existence. Even more shocking, at least to the traditionally pious law office, the island is ruled by a libertarian society organized around pagan rituals. Repelled by the open acceptance of sexuality, nature worship, and even witchcraft, the officer takes an antagonistic attitude towards the people and their leader, an eccentric but charming English lord (Christopher Lee). The officer's unease intensifies as he continues his investigation, slowly coming to fear that the girl's disappearance may be linked in a particularly horrifying manner to an upcoming public festival. Anthony Shaffer's meticulously crafted screenplay creates a thoroughly convincing alternative society, building tension through slow discovery and indirect suggestion and making the terrifying climax all the more effective. Performances are also perfectly tuned, with Woodward suitably priggish as the investigator and horror icon Lee delivering one of his most accomplished performances as Lord Summerisle. Little noticed during its original theatrical run due to studio edits and a limited release, the film's intelligence and uncanny tone has since attracted a devoted cult following.",

We follow a police officer named Sergent Howie to a remote island in Scotland called Summerisle. He is investigating the disappearance of a young girl, and from the moment he sets foot on the island you can tell something isn't quite right.The locals are secretive, unhelpful and downright strange. And intriguingly so. The Wicker Man is a mystery within a mystery and utterly compelling. You will feel Sergent Howie's despair and frustration as he constantly asks where is the missing girl, and receiving neither a straightforward or satisfactory answer.The music that accompanies this masterpiece enhances the already tense and dreamlike atmosphere greatly. The melodic and haunting sounds can be soothing at times but full of malice. The cast are brilliant. The islanders are utterly convincing as oblivious Devil should care types, who see nothing wrong with their lifestyle or what they are a part of. Edward Woodward gives a heroic performance as the confused Sergent determined to discover the truth. It is Christopher Lee however who steals the show as the island's minister, Lord Summerisle.Christoper Lee delivers an Oscar worthy performance as the proud and well spoken leader. His casual manner and overwhelming sense of authority add to the already sinister and unsettling theme of the film.The Wicker Man is one of my top ten favourite films as it is so unique and absolutely captivating. It is portrayed lightly throughout, but with an undercurrent of darkness and doom. As i'm sure you've already heard about the famous ending, i however won't spoil it. But i will tell you it is shocking and has stuck with me since the first time i saw it. Great ending, spectacular film.",

It is one of the few films that you encounter that genuinely transports you to another world, a world where a conventional Scottish Catholic is a strange alien creature, and a creature to be hunted.I won't reveal any details of the plot in this review but it's a film that is loaded with atmosphere - it literally oozes menace from a very early stage. Viewers who are expecting to be \"entertained\" with explosions and car chases will walk away unsatisfied, and those coming here expecting a conventional \"horror\" will be confused. There are no supernatural aspects to this film over and above the imaginings of the human mind. There are few moments designed to make you jump in the manner of a conventional horror - that is not what this film is about.This is a story of tribalism, religion, deadly group superstition and a devastating parable of the dangers of what can happen when groups of humans agree on fanciful explanations on the nature of reality.The acting isn't mind blowing, and the film does look its age, but none of these things really seriously matter. It's all about the atmosphere, and the isolation and this is portrayed amazingly well by the way the piece is structured, the cinematography and the wonderful music.All in all, this is a wonderful film, that will both fascinate and shock. Not everyone will like it, but it certainly ranks, for me, as one of the greatest films of all time. Many of the films that are made today are singularly incapable of capturing the imagination in the way this film does as it's difficult to imagine such an isolated community existing in our globalised world - and that's part of the magic of this tale. It's believable and if you let yourself go with it, it's a shocking and disturbing piece of cinema.A must see for anyone seriously interested in film.",

He has received a letter about a missing girl, but on arrival gets no help from the islanders, who hinder and mislead him, whilst his extreme, almost puritanical Christianity collides with the pagan practices enforced by the island's leader, the mysterious Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), leading to a terrifying conclusion...The film is very eerily shot, with some great use of music, much of it actually sung or performed on camera. The location shots of the Scottish Highland scenery, with it's houses, mountains and countryside add a very ethereal quality to the movie. The resulting atmosphere is one of almost jollified menace and this continuous right to the famous ending, with the islanders singing joyously as the wicker man goes up in flames.Some terrific performances abound here. Edward Woodward is spot-on as the continually perplexed and outraged policeman. Christopher Lee really enjoys his role as Lord Summerisle. Britt Ekland is alluring as the seductive Willow while the rest of the cast affect a well-realised veneer of sinister normality.The plot works very well in spite of one or two contrivances - in particular the scene where Howie is tricked into dressing up as Punch - and the famous ending works on two levels - the final nasty surprise which snares Howie in the Wicker Man and the hint that islanders actions will be to their own undoing as much as they prove to be Howie's.For those interested, it is worth reading up on the many articles written about the ideological struggle in \"The Wicker Man\", as the movie acts as a microcosm for many similar and more destructive struggles taking place in the world today.Provocative and powerful, \"The Wicker Man\" especially now is a film that needs to be seen.",

It's a non-scary but very mysterious Horror movie. Quite 'cheesy' but I believe it aged well as The Wicker Man maintains its quality with the storytelling. The bizarre atmosphere is absolutely fantastic as well.If there's one thing that may have bothered me a bit was that the locals didn't seem to be to concerned about their poor harvest.

I guess Robin Hardy can be extraordinarily flattered knowing that this piece will continue to age and remain relevant, especially as a social commentary of sorts.A horror that isn't really bloody. Police Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward), is sent to a remote island in search for missing girl Rowan Morrison. From the start it doesn't help that the locals are abrasive and lack any information, soon after the devout Christian realises he is surrounded by a community of Pagans. Ultimately leading to a hopeless climax, wherein logic is irrelevant and your fate on the island is ultimately sealed.Woodward's portrayal is timeless regardless how successful \"The Equalizer\" was, and Christopher Lee as Zealot Lord Summerisle is outstanding. Apparently it still remains Lee's favourite role but even after having more than 250 credits to his name, the man continues to have such a unique commanding presence in every picture. Unfortunately, too many of my peers now regard this film \"silly\", and the 2006 \"remake\" has only gone on to cement the absurdity of such a story. But I believe that \"The Wicker Man\", will continue to have influence for a very long time. I love how isolated from the outside world it remains and how futile Howie's investigation is, yet he bravely soldiers on in the face of animosity.All that remains to say is that the Scottish countryside is beautifully shot, and the eerie folk music build incredible tension. The mystery is revealed by the end and while it's nothing incredibly clever, the motives make sense to no one but the people who concocted it. The final moments are so wonderfully choreographed they end the movie as if it were a stage production.Final Verdict: A fantastic picture that ends in utter despair. 10/10. Classic British picture.",

It remains however well within the top 40 films of all time!So much has been written about the film, both here and in many learned places, I do not propose to re-hash the plot, merely to add my own viewpoint. Some years back CINEFANTASTIQUE devoted an entire publication to this genuinely awesome film, probably the most authoritative work ever compiled on the subject. Those amongst you who share the fascination of this one-off classic should try to locate a copy of this magazine.\nChristopher Lee once commented that this was the role of his life and he is correct. He IS Lord Summerisle! For his part, Edward Woodward as the pure and innocent Sergeant Howie, so far out of his depth and yet so rigidly determined to see justice done, must strike a heartfelt chord for anyone who cherishes Christian values (and who would be prepared to back them no matter the odds).Something happened with this film that is curiously indefinable. Perhaps the paganistic May-time songs, the extraordinary images such as the beetle inexorably circling the pin to which it is tethered. The incredible script from Anthony Schaffer, the maypole dance. There are just too many to mention - all part of the larger mosaic. The scene which sears more than any however, is that when Howie crests the hill and confronts the Wicker Man. His look of abject horror as he cries out in fear and desperation, is like nothing I have seen in any other film. You share his mortal terror and funk as surely as if you were in his place. The final scene of the collapsing Wicker Man to the back-drop of the setting sun while the villager chant in that dreadful circle is not something you can forget either. Having your dinner straight after this film would really not sit well would it?The greatness of this uniquely filmed masterpiece is beyond words. You can either SEE it or you can't!

What makes this movie stand head and shoulders above the horror films of the time (and since) is that feeling of a man losing control and falling inexorably towards his doom.

It is truly one of the greatest horror movies ever made.Horror films can be seperated into two types in my opinion. You have the horror films that depend on blood and gore to tell a story but then you have horror movies like this that depend on subtle shocks and the anticipation of terror to scare an audience.Edward Woodward plays Police Sergeant Howie who lives in Scotland but travels to an island off the coast to investigate the disappearance of a girl (without arming himself with a truncheon or handcuffs). At first, the islanders seem normal enough, aloof more than anything. However, gradually Sgt. Howie faces hostility and as a devout Christian, he is horrifed by some of the pagan practices on this island. He meets the Island Lord played by Christopher Lee who seems a nice chap at first...This is quite a realistic film. Even today in the UK, pagan rituals are practised in certain parts such as the south of England and Scotland. Those who practise pagan rituals believe that their way is right and do not take kindly to those who would try to change their way of life.Back to the film, Sgt. Howie becomes stranded on the island and because he foolishly didn't bother packing a truncheon or handcuffs, he has to depend on his wits to stay alive as the locals become more and more hostile.I will not give away the ending of this film because if you haven't seen it and I give it away, it's power to shock will be diminished. It is a truly horrible ending that sticks in your mind for days. I watched this film again at New Years Eve 2001 and the ending still shocked me, it's image ingrained on my mind for days.The truly scary thing about the activities of the pagans is that they do not actually believe that what they do is wrong. A conventional person may look at their practices and think that they are evil but a pagan will look at his/her rituals in an entirely different manner. Nothing is black and white.I believe there is going to be a remake of this film but nothing could ever match up to this masterpiece.",

            "content": "It's been a few months since I checked the comments for this movie, and wow, so many new comments, and so much anger expressed in some of the reviews. What gives? - have people been shelling out their savings in a desperate bid to find on-screen entertainment - only to have their hopes dashed against the rocks of disappointment? Sure sounds like it! I guess I better add my encounter/appointment with the Wicker Man to the list.I first saw this movie when I was quite young on TV in the late '70's. I'm sure it would have been severely edited for TV -  with very little sex or nudity to worry about, but it made a big impression on me and it left me feeling uneasy - this could well be the strangest movie I'd ever seen. My view of the world had just been altered!  In every TV show, movie, and real life incident I'd observed up till that time,   policemen (and other figures of authority) were always in control - and there were always others to back them up. That was the way of the world, wasn't it? So how could a figure of authority like Howie be so far out of his depth, and have so little control over his situation?\"   True, this is not a horror film by what we expect of the genre these days i.e. monsters, psychotic killers etc. The real horror here is Howie's predicament, finding himself in a situation with no familiar boundaries, where the rules and regulations which he has existed by in normal society count for nought. This premise is much more subversive and scary (& should still be) than any haunted house or possessed teenager coughing up bile. People's lives are built upon assumptions & understandings about the way things work, and to have all these stripped away would indeed be frightening. The other aspects of the film? Well, I guess we are dissuaded from siding with Howie too much, and he is portrayed as something of a control freak, representing uptight conformity at it's most repressive. But siding with the pagans isn't all that easy either, which I guess leaves you dangling somewhere in between?  The rituals & aspects of daily life shown in the film vary between quaint/bizarre/and just plain odd.  The music? a matter of taste I guess - I ordered the CD soundtrack as soon as it came out and I wouldn't part with it. Will have to give this movie a 10 out of 10 on the \"saw it when I was younger & I still think it's great (even if some other people don't)\" scale.",

            "content": "This striking, lavish shocker has an undeniable freshness and force and appeal, and is so exquisitely crafted, that many misunderstand it; as, although sensational, it isn't either sensationalist or exploitative, yet it doesn't take up ineffable emotions (others than those basically allowed for by the situation and the genre), sentiments, empathy, ideas or meaning, safe for the minimal psychology needed, because there's no interaction other than a deceitful and hopeless one, between a visitor on the island and the masks, and the islanders are shown only as deceivers, so that the copper is the only one characterized, in his interactions with a world of deceiving masks (two phony religions are opposed: a phony, gain-driven heathenism, and a phony Christianity, the heathenism is boosted by the Summerisle's lord need for gain, on a fruitful island the people eat fruits from the cans, this heathenism isn't idyllic, and the copper's death, though echoing the lines from S. Paul, has him cursing his enemies). But then, its art in offering something so suspenseful is all the more awesome, because it has to rely mostly on beauty, music and feeling, on atmosphere; the score has many folk tunes, pop music, which I enjoyed. The dreamy, feverish feel also comes from this plausible premise, of a person meeting only masks, in the remote place where he lands; therefore, if all has been deceit, all has been dreamy and ungrounded, and the script means to have it entirely so, since very few of the copper's former life is evoked, it's an experience of a labyrinth, with laconic psychology, and since then some other genre movies have been made in the same spirit, where a protagonist with a basic psychology has an experience of a puzzling situation, with a sense of menace, and this makes the '73 work a classic genre movie, and it's unfair to ask from it what it hasn't been supposed to be (e.g., a drama). One has to have the dignity and honor of acknowledging a good genre movie, and this one certainly is a masterpiece.Its New Age isn't glamorized at all. There are clues: the lack of fruits is due do the last year's bad crop. On the other hand, the storyline's logic is dreamlike: the bewitched islanders picked the copper, selected him, but how did they find him, how did they know whom to lure there? The copper doesn't phone, doesn't inform his office, doesn't keep in touch with the outside world, doesn't report, and we are in the '70s, and if an anonymous letter has been followed by an inquiry, the copper's disappearance would be as well. If he would of accepted the local Aphrodite's advances, if he would of surrendered sexually, would that of saved him? Does he ever get a chance? Hiding a girl is one thing, hiding the murder of a policeman is different. What are the islanders' chances in getting away with it? The islanders don't stage an accidental death, but a holocaust.It has a strong leading man, Woodward. The copper doing research in a public library, reading about occultism, must be an early use of the trope.Another good occasion for us to remember Lee, here as the master of Summerisle.",

Like other people I was entranced by the soundtrack - the most memorable parts of the film are those accompanied by the wonderful May time songs.The songs themselves are beguiling, seemingly simple but with hidden subtleties and they fit wonderfully with the plot.  The Willow Song and accompanying dancing is intensely erotic - how Sgt. Howie (Edward Woodward) does not succumb I shall never know !  My favourite song is Gently Johnny which is a plaintive ballad singing of the joys of physical play - it reminded me of some the baudy songs in Carmina Burana.  Particularly shocking was the joy and energy the islanders show singing Summer-is-a-coming-in during the films final shocking scene.I think the other aspect which I found particularly powerful was the ambiguity the film suggests about pagan beliefs - there is much beauty in them with refreshing viewpoints compared with Sgt. Howie's rather stuffy, religious nature and yet also a barbaric side which becomes increasing more evident as the film unfolds.This is definitely a film that should be watch 2-3 times in one go as there are many subtleties which may go unnoticed first time round.

Infofreak (\"The most original and haunting British horror movie EVER. Fascinating, chilling, and utterly unique\", Infofreak from Perth, Australia, 17 August 2003) also has good information about Britt Ekland's famous seduction dance.***\"Wicker Man\" is brave, erotic and disturbing. While it is widely considered one of the greatest horror films ever, it is sufficiently allegorical to represent a different conflict depending on who is watching it. Churchgoers may view it as an attack on their belief system. Others may perceive this as simply a detective mystery gone sour, as the investigation of a missing girl by British Police Sergeant Christian Howie (Edward Woodward) on a remote, Scotland island leads to an unexpected solution. There's Order vs. Chaos; Stability vs. Entropy. Considering the present times, it can represent a societal collapse, where social norms are disrupted.\"Wicker Man\" also concerns the delayed schedule of a man's coming of age. A key plot point is Sergeant Howie's (no-sex-before-marriage) celibacy. During the police investigation, Howie resists the considerable temptations of the landlord's lascivious daughter Willow (Brit Ekland, and body double), whose erotically-charged, full-frontal-nude dancing will raise the temperature of most viewers. The audience is encouraged to believe the Sergeant is a fool for not having the girl. During the memorable May Day ritual, the Sergeant is wearing the costume of the medieval fool Puck. His failure to launch with Willow lends some credibility to what happens next.What I find most surprising about \"Wicker Man\" is the prevalence of hippie music, particularly early on. Considering the frights in store, this music seems counter-intuitive; not just with horror films, but in films where sanctimony and blasphemy appear.Visually, the imagery (directed by Robin Hardy and photographed by Harry Waxman) seems effortless. I like how the early scenes are rendered. While Sergeant Howie sermonizes in a church; the photography is grainy with high contrast and the colors are washed out. This look helps the viewer detach from the Sergeant's moral universe.The performances are stellar. Edward Woodward as Sgt Howie, Christopher Lee as the sinister and imposing Lord Summerisle, Britt Ekland (and body double) and Diane Cilento as Miss Rose inhabit their characters well. Lee, with his towering frame and charismatic basso voice, is the standout performer. The biggest star is arguably Anthony Shaffer for writing such an audaciously provocative screenplay.Contemporary, nymphomaniac and bloodthirsty Pagans are dancing naked and mocking orthodox Christian ways. That sounds like a movie to enjoy to me.",

With the incredible final sequences etched in my mind I have, over the years, sought out other such stylish and accomplished scenes, in vain. The naked ladies and the fire at the stones is well shot and Britt Eckland's dance is impressive even if we are now made aware that it took 13 hours and the inclusion of another party. Some editing achievement there then. No, this is not an easy film to like with its amateurism and embarrassing sequences, and yet. Undeniably there is something here, something that resonates, something that draws me to take another look, every now and again and, of course, the reason some have always found it so impressive. It is hard to put a finger on it but perhaps it is because it does not have too many notable scenes, lacks an overall sense of style and seems rather awkward that it seems all the more to speak to us in less obvious ways and perhaps, thereby to tap into something of us we are less able to express but feel nevertheless.",

            "content": "An exercise in atmospheric terror, Hardy's 1973 'The Wicker Man' is of the utmost importance. Despite contrary belief, don't let anyone fool you into thinking this is a horror film, or any sort of genre piece for that matter. It is not. It is also not a psychological thriller. It is a thriller, and it is indeed psychological, but its no 'Seven' or 'Silence of the Lambs' and for a good reason. It is less about being unable to trust one person, and more about being unable to trust anyone. The film begins with a Christian police officer, arriving on duty, at the island of Summersile, a place that appears to be a close, friendly and tight knit island of happy-go-lucky Scots who are all apparently unaware of his reasons for being there. He passes a photograph of a young girl, said to have gone missing, amongst a group of elderly fishermen, who analyze the photograph. They deny knowing said girl so quickly that the viewer immediately grows suspicious. So does the protagonist. The thing that differentiates The Wicker Man from most films of its kind is that our hero is smart. He's quick on his feet and we get the feeling that he feels the same discomfort as we do, as it occurs. There is never an instance where we feel he may make a wrong decision that may deem him dislikable or deserving of his fate. Despite the dramatically stubborn religious pride he wears on his sleeve, we are not prepared to see the wool pulled over his eyes any time soon. He is directed by the fisherman to a small market, owned by the alleged mother of the girl in the photograph (also the woman responsible for writing the SOS). He confronts her, but as we know, the film can't wrap up with a simple, \"It's alright, I found her already, thanks for your help.\" She also denies not only writing the letter, but also that the girl in the photograph is her daughter. The paranoia worsens. We see a clearly, logically thinking person begin to stumble over himself, and rightfully so. Every piece of information he is fed seems to contradict the last, and no one seems to have any idea what he is talking about. What adds to the eeriness of the film is that there are no dramatic scenes where characters crack under pressure. There's no 'good cop, bad cop' routine, where civilians of the island are wrongfully interrogated. Instead we see people calmly and cruelly tampering with a sane person's sanity. One big, awful joke is being played on Sergeant Howie, and he's aware of it, too. The point where we begin to feel bad is when the lies and falsities become so convoluted, where we can't really blame him for being tricked. His fate is silently but surely being determined by an entire town's watchfulness and ill-informed belief system. For a good majority of the film we are falling victim to the people of Summersile's joke, too, and hoping for the best. Prior to cell phones, and wi-fi, and just about everything else, Howie has no communication with the outside world. He has traveled long and far to take part in his own torment. It hurts for us, too. This poor chap just wants to do his job and go home, and we know thats not going to happen. I have no intention of saying anymore due to the fact that this film is almost essential to those that prefer discomfort to horror, spooks over scares and atmosphere over guts and gore.",

            "content": "British horror movies. What is it that these three words project into your mind? The Gothic melodramatics of Hammer? Long, dark coats and flaming torches? Frankenstein? Dracula? Or none of the above? Is the impact of the British horror film so feeble that it doesn't even spark a reaction in your mind? You'd be forgiven as, despite from a few real gems in Hammer's back catalogue, the history of British horror is seeped in watered down, made-to-formula genre movies of very little substance. Of course, great movies were still being made, but one stands the test of time particularly well for its era. That film is The Wicker Man (1973), and its history is as intriguing as the film itself.Edward Woodward stars as Sgt. Neil Howie, a devout Christian and policeman searching for a missing girl on the Scottish Island of Summerilse. There are many clues suggesting that the girl has been killed as a sacrifice by the pagan cult that inhabits the island, lead by Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee). But Howie soon discovers that the girl may be held alive somewhere for a forthcoming ritual, and sets out to find her. During his time on the island, Howie encounters all kinds of blasphemous activity performed by the inhabitants who have rejected Christianity in favour of the 'old gods'. He witnesses fertility rituals where naked girls jump through fire, schoolchildren dancing around phallic maypoles, a school teacher lecturing on the importance of fertility and bizarre, masked people wandering the streets. Howie's Christianity (and virginity) is also put at risk by the landlord's daughter (Britt Ekland), who dances and sings naked in a room next to his, enticing him to a point where his faith (and the content of his scrotum) is almost lost.The narrative of The Wicker Man centralises on the conflict between Christianity and paganism without ever taking sides. This is shown beautifully within the characters of Howie and Lord Summerisle, with Woodward and Lee playing off each other, embodying the films exploration of religious differences through their performances (Lee has said that his performance is the best of his career). The na\u00efve, virginal, honest Howie proves to be no match for the calm, manipulative evil of Summerisle, and Howie's fate seems to be completely in his hands, but for those who have yet to see The Wicker Man, I will write no further of the outcome. If you have never heard of The Wicker Man's ending then you are praised indeed, and should see it before you find out just what is so shocking about it.Hardy's direction maintains consistency as the film switches between the bizarre, the comic, the erotic and the chilling, whilst also finding time for a few musical sequences (the one in which the landlord's daughter tries to seduce Howie from the room next door is particularly well done). In fact, The Wicker Man seems to switch genres frequently throughout, yet what could easily have been an uneasy mish-mash of genres is instead consistent, poetic, thoughtful and frightening in the hands of Hardy, whose willingness to just let things happen creates a feeling that just anything might. But this insistence to throw everything together may put some people off, as the film is never entirely sure what it wants to be. But those willing to go with the flow will find it a remarkably rewarding experience, and one that is not easy to forget.The Wicker Man was hardly seen upon its release, mainly due to poor marketing and the distributors difficulty in categorising the film itself (Hardy was known to keep changing his mind about the nature of the film throughout production, telling crew it was now a musical / a thriller / a comedy etc.) Also, a horror film that takes place in bright sunlight instead of dark, shadowy corridors probably confused the poor saps at the distribution company. The film was also heavily cut by distributors who didn't understand what the film was supposed to be about, but now, with a recent release on video and DVD, The Wicker Man is available in its longest form, just as Hardy had envisioned it. But finding the missing footage proved to be an exhaustive and painful exercise, as no one knew of its whereabouts. The footage was eventually found in the vaults of Roger Corman's production company, as he had been sent a print on the film's completion. This print was used to restore the missing footage, but still the only existing negative has never been found and is believed to be buried underneath a motorway somewhere in England. For a more in-depth account of this particular films history, pick up Allan Brown's excellent book 'Inside The Wicker Man'.Although slightly dated, the theme of conflicting religious beliefs is just as relevant today and the intriguing detective story will keep just about everyone hooked.",

For I found the writing by Anthony Shaffer based on a book by the late David Pinner, a despicable and disgusting work of film making.Even with the likes of the actors, Edward Woodward, Christopher Lee, Diane Cilento and Britt Ekland, it is still in my eyes a dangerous film to have our young people to view. I write this criticism in hopes that parents will prevent their children and young teens in seeing this. It is truly the most horrendous type of work. Director Robin Hardy, man/woman spared no pains in bringing the hopelessness of believing in any kind of salvation. They have got to be atheists themselves to even want to produce such a sacrilegious piece of work. Shame on them as I condemn them myself to eternal hell for filming it. If I could face both writers and directors, I'd give them an up-pence they deserve for such contempt.I warn you all and ask you all, even you obvious sick people who found this entertaining, to begin condemning this film and see that it is never viewed again. It's that repulsive. Killing human beings, animals, to make a point is not entertainment. And then to show the burning of them to the end. Next we'll watch Joan of Ark at the stake, then Marie Antoinette beheaded and think this is enjoyable. No more of this horrible anti Christ stuff.",

As a thriller it fails to thrill, as a musical (yes there is much music) it is out there and unenjoyable and as a horror story it is unremarkable.So many have said that this is a classic horror film, but I hated it. The only redeeming feature of this snoozer is the always reliable Christopher Lee. He provides the right amount of menace for his character, Lord Sumerisle. The story could also be filed under mystery. It chronicles the journey of a religious and strong principled investigator Sgt. Howie. He has been brought to the sleepy island of Sumerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl whom the locals say never existed. He soon uncovers scandalous secrets of town rituals. I know that this is a \"cult film\" but that is certainly one cult I'd stay away from.",

The plot doesn't take much time to pick up its steady pace..Sergeant Howie, a devout Christian, played brilliantly by Edward Woodward, receives an anonymous letter recommending that he undertake the investigation of the disappearance of a young girl from the remote island of Summerisle. He sets off on this task by leaving for the island. Once there, during his quest, little by little he uncovers what actually happened to the girl. What he learns leaves him as well as the viewer equally shocked and disturbed...Make no mistake, this is a truly great picture...with a fantastic screenplay by Anthony Shaffer, brilliantly directed by Robin Hardy. And then there's the already famous soundtrack by Paul Giovanni and Magnet, which consists of folk songs performed by the characters in the film. They are also aptly placed and great accompaniments fitting in well with the narrative in some of the key scenes in the film. Albeit, the \"low budget\" element shows..Harry Waxman's cinematography is not very crisp, but that's small potatoes.About the acting...Edward Woodward in the lead role is outstanding as Sergeant Howie. Christopher Lee delivers a fantastic performance as Lord Summerisle in one of the best roles of his career. Then there is Britt Ekland's unforgettable \"Willow\"..and the other bunch of loony characters on the island...all make for some truly bizarre and memorable characters.It's a pity that the original release in Britain was massacred and reduced to a 87 minutes version..and to top it all, released as a B-picture on a double bill with \"Don't Look Now\"! It is difficult to believe. It definitely deserved a bigger, independent initial release.However, this film has stood the test of time, and is now revered as a cult classic, more than 30 years after its release.It is sacrilege to miss this one...go for it!",

Read only 1st 2 if you've not seen the film.I recently bought 4 movies whilst on holiday in Canada, 4 horror films which are either unavailable, banned or cut in the UK.They were Deep Red, I Spit on Your Grave, Zombie and The Wicker Man. After watching them all (!) in 1 afternoon / evening only one film left me feeling truly chilled ... The Wicker Man. Featuring no gore, no violence as we would expect from a horror and no explicit language out of context this is a proud example of what the horror genre needs more of.The Wicker Man has the audience seeing the ending from a long way off and yet teases them that all will turn out ok in the end, but In one of the most traumatic finales I have ever seen, it doesn't.The weird imagery and music of the majority of the film builds up a surreal, dream-like atmosphere from which we are abruptly awaken as Sgt Howie chases Alice (Rowan) out of the rabbit-hole from wonderland into a waking nightmare. Our feeling of security in his authority as a police officer is stripped as he is stripped and dressed in sacrificial robes.In his desperate plea to the villagers, Sgt Howie's reasoning falls on deaf ears, as though he were talking in another language, except the barrier here is belief and religion rather than words and meaning. Even Howie himself appears to lose faith as his rock-solid character crumbles and his prayers to Christ turn to profanity as he screams 'Jesus'.With fantastic performances all-round, this is a rare gem of a british movie and knocks spots off the Hammer \"movie template\".",

Very emotionally engaging film, almost suggestive, and affected you in a weird way that most movies don't. Works on a deeper/intellectual level as well and seem to explore some very interesting questions, almost making you dizzy when you think about it. Christopher Lee is usually a creepy guy in films but i think this is the creepiest role i have ever seen him in.

I can't say much more, you have to see the film yourselves.I find it hard to rate something like this, (i still don't quite know what hit me) but a perfect 10 would probably be closest.

            "content": "This oddity of a movie went by almost unnoticed on its initial cinema release, playing support as part of a double bill that also included Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now (another sublime work but that's another story). The very fact that The Wicker Man was met with such indifference seems somewhat absurd now. Over the years its reputation has grown and grown to the point that its often described as the greatest horror film to come out of Britain. I can't say I disagree with this view either. It remains a commendably intelligent and original genre picture and there really isn't anything else out there much like it.Its story about a policeman who travels to a remote Scottish island to investigate the disappearance of a young girl is not worth going into here. If you know the story it will serve no purpose, and if you have never seen the film before it will only spoil the experience. The mystery element is a significant strong point. The investigation of the disappearance of Rowan Morrison is never less than compelling. But what elevates this movie further is a combination of this strong narrative with an intelligent script and the bizarre details that are used to depict the unusual way of life of these pagan islanders. This latter aspect is serviced by the general oddness of the inhabitants, their pagan rituals and of course their music. The film is replete with folk songs. They simultaneously lend the story an authenticity and surrealism. The soundtrack incorporates a variety of moods from haunting lilting drones to the strangely upbeat. Best of all, of course is 'Willow's Song'. This is the haunting ballad sung by the femme fatale Willow in the dead of night through a wall to the protagonist Sergeant Howie in the next room. It's a song of enticement, where the siren tests the chaste policeman with one final trial of temptation. Even the repressed Christian policeman struggles to fight the sexual desire engendered by Willow and her song. To be honest the 'Willow's Song' sequence is worth the price of admission alone. The song itself is quite spine-tinglingly and hauntingly beautiful and this combined with the loveliness of the semi-naked Britt Ekland's provocative performance makes it one of the most perfectly conceived sequences of erotica in cinema.There is a great cast here too. Edward Woodward is terrific as Sergeant Howie, while Christopher Lee exudes cool authority as lord Summerisle. But even characters in small parts have real personality here, while there is a trio of fantastic actresses to add further class, namely, the aforementioned Britt Ekland, Diane Cilento and Ingrid Pitt - what more do you want? Then you have very odd performances from the likes of Lindsay Kemp as the highly camp landlord Alder MacGregor and Aubrey Morris as the strange gravedigger. Its overall a brilliant cast, well used. In addition to this the various locations and the landscape are used to great effect. The setting adds a great deal to the impact and helps generate the unique mood that The Wicker Man has. While the inclusion of various elements of pagan worship and belief is done in a considered way and always seems believable.There are two versions of this film available. And it does have to be said that the directors cut is the one to watch. Not only does it include extra scenes on the mainland and one where a young boy becomes a man via a ritual involving Willow but it also reorders the position of 'Willow's Song' within the story. In the director's cut this scene comes near the end of the film, just before the May Day finale. This means that it has extra significance. It makes it clear that it is the final test put to Sergeant Howie. In the original it comes too early and doesn't have the same impact.The Wicker Man remains a highly original work. Its story has a real purpose too. By the end of it you see everything fall into place and it becomes obvious that there is some real intelligence behind this. Its a glorious one of a kind movie.",

            "content": "1973. While \"The Exorcist\" was scaring folk back into churches, \"The Wicker Man\" was doing the opposite. Both films saw foot-soldiers of Christ attempting to save little girls from supposedly \"demonic\" forces, but with \"The Wicker Man\" you're practically invited to root for Christ's fail.Like many films of its era (even such innocuous ones as \"Kramer vs Kramer\"), \"The Exorcist\" was an unconscious reaction to a bevy of changes rocketing across American society. Though marketed as \"shocking\" and \"new\", these films typically put forth very conservative messages, attempting to restore a pre-counterculture order in which daddy is boss, children don't swear, mommy doesn't work, sex and science are bad and everyone believes in God.\"The Wicker Man\", of course, is a British film, so (like Ken Russell's \"The Devils\", released 2 years earlier) you get a slightly more pessimistic take on the period. Unlike \"The Exorcist\", which might have well been a Vatican propaganda piece, our religious hero here is a prudish chump called Sergeant Howie. Howie's shown to be completely impotent, incompetent, dies in a flaming pyre, is not miraculously saved by God, and the film's bad guys are the kinds of superstitious, religious nut jobs who were presented as the good guys in \"The Exorcist\". Their religion founded on an radical abstinence from sex, yet overflowing with a repressed sexuality in which phallic symbols are worshipped and little boys sing songs about impregnating women, the film's religious cult represent a kind of demented patriarchy in which God and Daddy protect villages from drought and misery, providing you remain steadfastly devoted to all things phallic.Directed by Robin Hardy and starring Hammer Horror legend Christopher Lee, \"The Wicker Man\" is today regarded as a classic of British horror. Its climax in particular is one of cinema's great sequences: it's a creepy, memorably directed set piece in which Howie confronts a religious cult. Slowly and slowly the sequence mounts, Hardy's imagery becoming increasingly bizarre (men in dresses, animal costumes, pagan dancing, giant wicker statues) such that it eventually creates a kind of ontological shock. \"I believe in the life eternal as promised to us by our Lord, Jesus Christ!\" Howie repeatedly yells, as he's cremated alive, \"Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, Jesus Christ!\" But God doesn't answer. The film ends with a kind of reversal of the Spanish Inquisition, our religious hero revealed to be as fanatical and psychotic as that which he denounces, sacrificed as a heathen by heathens themselves.Decades later \"The Wicker Man\" would be remade by Neil LaBute, who has made a career writing stories which play with, wallow in, reverse and test sexist, racist and classist stereotypes. With \"The Wicker Man\" (2006) he throws out the original's patriarchal cult and replaces it with matriarchal communes and rampant misogyny. In LaBute's hands Howie then becomes a character played by Nicholas Cage, an apparently noble, self sacrificing cop. Meanwhile the pagan cult is revealed to be a matriarchy where women run things and men serve only as manual labourers. Much of the film takes deliberate swipes at both feminism and femininity in general, with school girls literally chanting \"phallic symbol!\" and laboratories filled with jars of dead foetuses. Women, the film says, use their control over human reproduction to keep men out of the loop, stupid and at their feet. They are scheming, cruel and devious, and adept at using man's protective instincts against him. This is all encapsulated by an early scene in which Cage picks up a child's doll on the highway after it has flown out of a car window. He pulls the car over and hands the doll back to its owner: a rude little girl who reveals herself to be ungrateful. Later Cage risks his life to save the girl from flames (foreshadowing his own fiery encounter late in the film). Masculine nobility, the film says, is co-opted by the evil inherent to females. \"You bitches! You bitches!\" Cage spends the second half of the film screaming, his masculine weapons, status as a police office, fists, technology and bravado unable to hold back the might of womanness.While the film says women are a loose commune of praying-mantis-like feminist harpies who lure men into their web, use their sperm (literally) and then burn them alive in big wicker cages, LaBute also seems to suggest that much of this lady-hatred is something already latent in Cage. The film itself may be Cage's \u2013 recently burnt by an ex lover - sexist fever dream. Though denounced as being misogynist, the film seems (but not necessarily; I dare not watch it again to find out for sure) to be portraying the exaggerated, worst fears of a misogynist (Cage) and the worst case scenario of extreme feminism. Of course most of LaBute's plays and films (\"Fat Pig\", \"Some Girls\", \"Reasons to Be Pretty\", \"Company of Men\") are implicitly about abuse, and attempt to critique rampant sexism. These critiques mostly backfire, though at least LaBute is an equal opportunity offender, oscillating between films in which whites abuse blacks, blacks abuse whites, fat people abuse skinny people and vice versa, women abuse men and men abuse woman. There's something systematic about LaBute's projects, successive films and plays deliberately presenting the opposite of that which went before (consider the way race relations are reversed in \"Lakeview Terrance\" and \"Death at a Funeral\").Regardless, LaBute's remake is horrendous. LaBute's not a strong visualist and much of his film is unintentionally funny, though not silly enough to be enjoyably camp.8/10 - Though dated and poorly paced in some sections, the original \"The Wicker Man\" is worth watching for its climax. Worth one viewing.",

My father loves it a lot and was the one who inspired me to buy this version that includes all three existing versions, and of course, I started with the cinematic cut. I have only heard things about it before and didn't know what to expect from it, because it was mostly mentioned in the same context as Ari Aster's modern psychological terror fest \"Midsommar\" that has drawn a lot of inspiration from this movie here, and that is as twisted as this one. While I famously wasn't that thrilled by Aster's work, this one here really fascinated me on a mysterious level. On the surface, it seems to be a crime thriller about a mainland police officer who sets out to investigate the vanishing of a little girl on a secluded island, but the more time passes, the more the secrets unfold and reveal a disturbing truth. This film here is anything but ordinary and definitely not suitable for the average moviegoer, because aside from its original premise that indicates a crime thriller, it also combines many different other genres at the same time. When the islanders break out into song multiple times, it becomes a musical or when said people watch our protagonist from the distant while wearing disturbing animal masks, it has a strong horror film feeling as well. Whatever you call it, it is effective, at least for me. If you look for blood, gore or jump scares, you are at the wrong address with this film, because the tension is solely created by its subtle and mostly unnoticeable, small details that only contribute to the grotesque ending. It is full of sexual innuendos and similar symbolism and constantly juxtaposes natural religion and Christianity, as well as their respective rites and customs. The iconic and unforeseen ending is only the jaw-dropping climax of the whole psychological horror the film creates. \"What horror?\", you may ask, and I am going to show you what I mean. As already mentioned, the film is not graphic at all. The only thing that makes you feel extremely uncomfortable is those people living out their strange believes and customs, because what is there in the world more creepy than religious fanatics sacrificing everyone and everything in order to please their gods? This is the closest we get to real life horror, and I totally dig it. Of course, it still isn't perfect, mostly because protagonist Sergeant Howie isn't quite the most likable character and Lee's Lord Summerisle is underused (at least in this version), but it still has something intriguing that grabbed me the entire time. In the end, it definitely is a classic that convinces with its uncommon concept and atmosphere, and singlehandedly created a whole new subgenre of horror. You should have watched it at least once, if you consider yourself a horror film fan. I am pretty sure the other versions will improve this one here a lot.",

So out of curiosity I decided to give the original a watch, and all I have to say is... What in god's name is this?I've seen people call this a horror movie, and I'd say it's very very VERY far from that. This movie seems less like a horror film or a thriller and more like a crappy exercise at trying to unsettle you. As I watched this I felt less unsettled and more weirded out, even more weirded out then when I watched the remake. The plot sounds intriguing and starts off very strongly, but as it goes on and you see more of the people on the island it just seems stupid, preachy and even a little pretentious at that. Also something else I really, really really have to complain about is the music score. For a movie that tries so hard to be creepy and bizarre the music score doesn't fit the movie at all. It's surprisingly very upbeat in scenes where you wouldn't expect it too. Did the director listen to the score and think \"Yes! This fits the movie's tone perfectly.\" It's a more unfitting score then the score to The Uninvited.The best thing I could say about this movie are the performances from the two leads. Edward Woodward as the police officer Sergeant Howie is perfectly cast and commands a strong presence in every scene he's in, and Christopher Lee is clearly having a blast in the role of Lord Summerisle and does a great job at coming off as charming yet creepy as he always does.I'd strongly suggest not going near this at all. I know this movie is an important part of horror movie history to some people, but I guess not all of history is meant to be good. This gets a 3/10.",

Sergeant Howie realizes that the townsfolk are not being straight with him about the missing girl -- first they claim that no such girl exists on the island; then he finds that the schoolteacher has the name \"Rowan Morrison\" in her records, and manages to get the schoolteacher to admit that, well, OK, Rowan existed, but she died.

First he searches every house in the village to try to find her; then he decides to infiltrate the May Day parade/sacrifice ceremony.Sergeant Howie does find out what happened to the girl -- but the movie ends with a twist that seems to reverse everything you expected to happen.I must comment on the music. I usually hate musicals, but the musical numbers in the film worked fine for me. There was the ribald drinking song about the landlord's daughter (Willow, played by Britt Ekland). There was the lovely siren song that Willow sings to Sergeant Howie from the other side of the wall. There were a couple of others. All of them helped the film, usually by showing the viewer how ribald and paganistic these villagers really are.I'm pleased to have discovered this film. Rent this if you want something more intelligent than the latest Jason slasher flick.",

It's not about throwing scares in your face, it's about picking up on the subtle horrors and slowly learning about how twisted this place really is. The fact that it's so close to how people really live, but just with some minor quirks just makes it more disturbing. The music is fantastic and adds to the tension, the cinematography is so 70's but it works perfectly. The acting is terrific, especially from Ed Woodward and Christopher Lee.

            "content": "Enveloped with a chilling sense of dread, The Wicker Man is a gradually escalating nightmare that's bizarre, unsettling, outlandish, disconcerting & terrifying in truly unimaginable ways. However, not even in my wildest thoughts did I expect this to be a musical, and so the discovery was so weird & wicked that it nearly ruined the whole picture for me.Set on a small Scottish island, the story follows a Police sergeant who flies to the remote place to investigate the disappearance of a young girl, only to learn from the townsfolk that she never existed. A devout Christian, he is further appalled to discover that the locals have renounced Christianity and embraced pagan beliefs, and attempts to get to the truth of it all.Directed by Robin Hardy, everything about this British horror is different from the norm, and that can go either way with the viewers. The imagery is as confounding as it is disturbing, brims with an uneasy quality that further ratchets the suspense, and hints at a bigger conspiracy brewing beneath the surface. It's not scary per se but definitely has a creepiness to it that crawls under the skin.What didn't work for me, however, is the musical treatment that felt off, the slow pace that retains several scenes that could've been shortened without losing their effectiveness, and a few over-the-top performances that stopped me from taking the premise seriously. On the plus side, the pagan elements are finely researched, the intrigue is never lost, and the climax aptly brings the journey to full circle.Fascinating & frustrating in equal does, The Wicker Man relies on its atmosphere to deliver the thrills, and makes for an interesting juxtaposition of societal norms & counterculture that reaches its boiling point with a bold & bracing finale. While its unconventional treatment & deteriorating outward appearance will leave some viewers cold, there is a mystical aura to it that's powerfully alluring. It is one film I plan to revisit again in the future but for now, this rating will have to suffice.",

            "content": "A cut above all the other Hammer films that were so popular at the time, Anthony Sheffer's mature and ahead of it's time occult chiller \"The Wicker Man\" is director Robin Hardy's unique attempt at the horror genre, whose originality and one-of-it's-kind style has never been doubled. With a bright Springtime setting, soft-focus cinematography, a 'friendly' folk soundtrack and oddly sympathetic antagonists, Hardy creates a falsely safe environment, which, like it does to our hero, draws the audience in, gradually uncovering a brooding atmosphere of dread and terror that lies beneath it's harmless surface. Though it does happen in a slow pace, when the horror of \"The Wicker Man\" finally shows it's face, it comes with full power, leaving the viewer stunned and shocked, with a finale so terrifying today as it was back in the 70's when it was first released. Anthony Sheffer's intelligent script does not only succeed in it's originality and suspense-build up, but also in creating an interesting analogy of Christianity vs. Paganism, while questioning the pros and cons of both religions. Thus, it makes us question who the real villains are, and rather disturbingly so, also forces us to reflect over whether the antagonist's action can actually be considered crimes. On top of it all, the film also benefits from a great cast, which includes Edward Woodward, the gorgeous Britt Ekland (who, by the way, stars one of the most deliciously erotic scenes in the film) as well as the horror veterans such as Ingrid Pitt and Christopher Lee, the latter being a particularly interesting choice as, though playing a villain, does it so much differently than what he did in his previous works. Overall, a masterpiece of horror cinema which, though unfairly received at it's release, is finally getting the recognition it deserves. 10/10",

This isn't strictly true. It's more a detective film, though not your usual detective flic.Edward Woodward plays Scots police sergeant, Howie. One day, he receives a letter informing him that a girl has gone missing on one of the islands off the Scottish coast. The letter writer remains anonymous.\nWhen Sergeant Howie arrives on the island to investigate the girl's disappearance, and although he has a picture of the girl (which was included with the letter he received), the islanders tell Sgt. Howie they've never seen her before and that someone has been pulling his leg.\nEvery attempt Sgt. Howie makes to uncover the truth, is successfully frustrated by the local citizens. Gradually, Edward Woodward (who is magnificent in the part of Sgt. Howie), discovers that all is not what it first seems. The islanders, it seems, are modern pagans, and for them, Mayday is the most important day of the year. The previous year, their crops failed.

            "content": "\"The Wicker Man\" is a peculiar little film. It begins as a typical mystery: a Scottish detective travels to a remote Island off Scotland's coast where he is to investigate a report of a missing girl. Then the film mutates into a musical of sorts with numerous shots of topless women. Then it becomes a mystery again, this time fueled by religious beliefs. Undoubtedly paganism was an eye-opening concept in 1973 and while it doesn't completely translate in terms of effectiveness today, it presents an interesting theistic argument and lays the groundwork for a number of future thrillers that would employ similar twists.Edward Woodward stars as the police officer investigating into the missing girl, which is suspicious right off the bat. \"The Wicker Man\" is not particularly good at hiding the vital clues to the film's mystery, but then again this is thirty-some years and consequently more experience with the thriller genre talking. Presumably the rites and rituals of pagan culture mystified and perplexed people a bit more back then. Anyway, as he starts to look into the mystery the landlord's daughter (Britt Eckland) attempts to seduce him and the Summer Isle's lack of sexual censorship becomes 'celebrated' in the film.At first, \"The Wicker Man\" appears to attack the God-fearing Christian. Sgt. Howie, the detective, is outraged at the lack of Christian morality on the island. He can't believe that the church is no longer a church and that no priest or minister exists. His ignorance is laughable in a modern context, making his character a bit despicable. It is a film not kind to Christianity or at the least Christians who choose to remain ignorant about faiths that do not believe in Jesus Christ and are appalled that someone can practice them.Eventually that concept evolves. It still remains a film thematically based in religion, but Anthony Shaffer's story suggests that we not be so quick to pass judgment on those who believe differently and hold different moral standards than ourselves. The moral guidelines that different groups of people follow are not clear-cut; right and wrong is not so black and white. In that sense \"The Wicker Man\" is a brave film despite its flaws.It would be wrong to classify \"The Wicker Man\" as horror. It is a thriller with non-traditional religious themes that seem cultish and mysterious. It is a mystery that despite not being the most elaborate and impressive of story lines, is nonetheless unique and highly memorable. Undoubtedly anyone that sees this film will remember its final act, culminating in the burning of the wicker man.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",

The film did not scare me but when the end came did very much so shock me and disturb me cause I did not see the end coming like that at all. for a film thats 34 years old to still shock and surprise is a BIG accomplishment which is why its probably a classic.

I've seen movies about cults and weird religions and so forth, but nothing like this.A police inspector named Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) is dispatched to an island of the coast of Scotland to find a missing girl. Once there, he encounters a mysterious populace, all of whom seem to know more about the missing girl than they are sharing.Common knowledge classifies this film as a horror film, but that is a misconception. Apart from the last few mildly chilling minutes, it's not scary, it's just plain weird. Actually, it's more of a mystery. But it's anything but straightforward.The film's construction has a lot to do with the film's success or failure (this really depends on the viewer). Robin Hardy chooses to have Howie serve as a voyeur investigating the people of the island, and while this is never uninteresting, it sometimes causes the story to lose focus.Again, this is not a horror film, at least in the strictest sense. If you're looking for something like \"Halloween\" or, closer to the film's type, \"Les Diaboliques,\" this ain't it. Comparing \"The Wicker Man\" to any of the so-called \"traditional\" horror films is like comparing \"There's Something About Mary\" to \"Monty Python.\" That said, even looking at \"The Wicker Man\" as a \"way out there\" film, it still isn't perfect.The film would be more effective had it had a more sympathetic protagonist. Sergeant Howie is supposed to be the \"hero\" of the movie, but he's such a jerk that it's incredibly hard, if not impossible, to sympathize with him.Still, in some strange way I kind of liked this movie. It's never boring, and it has a few effective scenes. Actually, it gets better with after-viewing reflection. Still, I gave it a 6 because I was disappointed that it wasn't very scary.Do I recommend it? It depends on what you're looking for.

The result - well, it was actually pretty good. \"The Wicker Man\" is about a devout Christian detective, Seargant Howie, who arrives at Summerisle, an isolated island off the coast of Scotland. He is there to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. While the island folk seem a little strange, he continues his investigation, asking all local residents and businesses on the island, and keeps on hitting dead ends. But as time goes by and Seargant Howie observes the islander's Pagan rituals, he begins to suspect that the young girl may have been chosen for a human sacrifice. In a race against time to save the girl, Seargant Howie soon finds out that he may be the one who needs to be saved...I found this movie to be really interesting, the whole story was well done and like nothing that I've ever seen before. The film was rather short, running at 84 minutes long. As I understand it, Europe has a 100 minute director's edition that is available, so maybe those extra 16 minutes contained footage that was beneficial to the movie, because it was pretty short. Who knows? Even with it's brisk running time, the subject matter is compelling, watching the rituals and different beliefs put in action by the islanders was interesting enough. The overtones of paganism and ancient religious beliefs was really intriguing and an interesting subject matter. As the strange rituals take place, leading up to the sacrificial ceremony, the suspense level is quite high, especially when the twist is introduced. I didn't really find the film to be 'scary' per se, I found it to be more bizarre, but in a good way. Horror legend Christopher Lee gave a good performance as the strange leader of the island, and Edward Woodward was fitting as Seargant Howie, the narrow-minded detective. Britt Ekland also turns in a memorable performance as the odd young woman named Willow. The whole atmosphere of the island, and the creepy music and rituals are what made the movie so eerie I believe. The sense of being in a foreign place, surrounded by things you don't understand is really frightening. And the abrupt, brutal ending makes the film even harder to forget, it sticks in your mind for days. Bottom line is, \"The Wicker Man\" is a classic horror movie in almost every way, but if you're a horror fan who is limited to slasher, chop-em-up horror movies, \"The Wicker Man\" isn't for you. It emanates a sense of foreboding and a feeling of being surrounded by people whom you don't understand, which can surprisingly be a terrifying premise. Check it out if you appreciate older horror films, it's a must-see suspense thriller and will leave you thinking about it days after viewing, especially after the shocker of an ending. 9/10.",

            "content": "When i saw this film in 1973 at the age of 20, alone at night in the dark, it stunned me. A genuine believable horror story. No special effects, a great script, fine performances, limited budget . Just about every box that needs to be ticked in a horror film was included. A haunting scene with folk music is one of the films most memorable moments. A cracking ending, with Christoper Lee in fine form, it is a work that cannot be praised highly enough.Another positive no stupid comedy scenes to wreck the flow and build up of tension as the film progresses. Why oh why cannot horror film makers produce work like this, instead of the unimaginative effect ridden slasher scenes with teens, in so many productions today.",

            "content": "SPOILERS ALERT (if such a terrible movie could in fact be spoiled...) In October I set out to watch the greatest scary movies ever made. Searching the internet I found a list of 50 movies that included the Wicker Man. The synopsis suggested it had potential to be good but in watching it I learned the opposite.The Wicker Man is one of the worst films ever made (more disturbingly, Hollywood decided to remake it with Nicholas Cage decades later). As a horror, mystery, thriller, or any other genre it fails. Even if you were to watch it as a comedy, given how bad it is, you would be disappointed given how dull it is and how its cheesiness just gets on your nerves rather than making you laugh.Filmed largely in daylight, full of singing & dancing, lots of nudity while singing & dancing, and with the villains being too weird to unnerve the audience, there is absolutely nothing scary about say 99% of the movie.Then comes the ending which has a slight touch of horror but it is not enough to redeem the movie and in fact makes the viewer even angrier with the makers of the film. Basically, the main character (Sgt. Howie) is a Christian police officer who goes to an island where a little girl has gone missing to investigate. He encounters a pagan populace worshiping ancient deities and comes to a the conclusion that the girl is to be the blood sacrifice to appease the gods and make the crop yields better next year.The surprise at the end of the movie is that HE is to be the victim and the girl even helps to entrap him when he goes to rescue her at the ceremony at the end. In that moment you the viewer feel a great deal of sympathy for Sergeant Howie as he is dragged off by these deluded townspeople to be burned alive in a \"Wicker Man\" along with various animals in cages. Christopher Lee's character, Lord Summerisle, has pushed this ritual since he fears his town will sacrifice him if the crops fail the next year.This moment is the only good part of the movie but it comes after suffering through nearly an hour and a half of utter crap. There is no suspense until the final moments and because of this you merely feel cheated AND furious at the dark ending. To be frank, the townspeople are extremely irritating and the Sergeant is an idiot (five minutes after arriving in the plane he knew something was wrong with these people yet he went UNARMED to the blood sacrifice to save the girl).This movie could have been saved if as he was being surrounded, Sergeant Howie said 6 words: \"Good thing I brought my gun!\" That would have made the film a bit more like its distant cousin, Hot Fuzz. That is what Wicker Man is: An old version of Hot Fuzz with none of the qualities that make that movie a classic.In closing, if you want a good movie with a small town conspiracy, try the comedies Hot Fuzz & Waking Ned Devine, the horror flicks Population 436 & Sleepy Hollow, or even the television series Twin Peaks. I'm sure there are other works I could mention that are far better. Save yourself from the Wicker Man!",

            "content": "Robin Hardy's documentary on life on the wee Scottish Island of Summerisle will only surprise those who have yet to travel to the land that some have dared called 'directly to the north of England'. Those familiar with Scots Culture and tradition will unsheathe difficult and often uncomfortable points of recognition and dread as they follow Edward Woodward's doomed expedition to find a missing girl in the insular Island community. The naked couples romping in fields outside the local pubs, the institutional paganism, the horse costumes, the profound ignorance of the local people, the desecrated religious monuments, the culture of inbreeding and the construction of large sacrificial vessels for unsuspecting tourists - all important tenets of agrarian communities in the north but sadly not to be found in tourist literature on the area. In Fact the Scottish Tourist Information website only lists Summerisle as 'great for a pub lunch'.This is a chilling slice of island life in which we're invited to consider our good fortune in having embraced Enlightenment thinking (in as much as some of us have), developed industrial practise and liberal values. Lord 'leave no traces' Summerisle, the very personification of the argument for the reform of the upper house, leads a community in which the people would rather burn visitors and wait for the next apple crop than send someone across to the mainland to visit a supermarket. It's all very well setting light to local law enforcement but come on, would a trip to Marks have killed anyone? No, and thats the point.",

There are hundreds of comments here, and obviously I can't check every one (well I can, but I can't be bothered), but all the ones I've looked at get it wrong.The religion in the Wicker Man; it isn't particularly pagan, it isn't druidic, it isn't pre-Christian, and it isn't Ancient British. It's made up. Lord Summerisle explains this quite clearly half way through, when he tells Howie how his grandfather established the community, but that something was missing, so he introduced this artificial religion as an exercise in social engineering.This isn't just accidental either. It's critical to understanding the appalling ending, where Howie warns Summerisle that this awful sacrifice better work, or else he'll be next. Hence the haunted expression on Summerisle's face, because he knows Howie is right, and because he also knows that the religion is made up, and it's just a load of old tosh. And that makes the horror even worse for Howie, because he knows that there is nothing he can do, and that at least one participant knows it's a charade, but will go through with it anyway.I've given this film 8 stars, which for me is high praise, and though I didn't think much of it when I first saw it (when it was first released) it grows in my estimation every time I see it. It's certainly much more intelligent than even its fans appear to give it credit for.There's a message for contemporary Britain here. Britain is going through a crisis of xenophobia and racism because of imagined problems with immigration. There are a number of idiots around who claim that we need to rediscover a sense of national identity and rediscover our Britishness (or, in some versions, our Englishness), and crucially, they also claim that such nationalism can be benign and non-racist. They need to watch the Wicker Man and think about it very hard. This invention of a set of ideas to fulfill a perceived social need is exactly what Lord Summerisle's grandfather did, and look what a Frankenstein's monster he created.The final irony in all this is that there is a British singer songwriter called Billy Bragg, a leftwinger who witters on about rediscovering or reclaiming Britishness or Englishness just as I've described. But this same Billy Bragg has also derided the Wicker Man for presenting a travesty of pagan religion. Yes, Billy. Of course it's a travesty. It's meant to be. Go back and watch it again, and this time pay attention. They're talking about you.",

            "content": "*Spoiler/plot- 1973, An idealistic Highland police sergeant constable flies his plane to a remote Scottish rural island due to investigate a complaint by a local villager over the apparent disappearance of a young local girl. The more he investigates the crime he finds that the whole island's inhabitants are followers of a local odd nobleman and his nature worshiping religion much like the early pagan Druids. These villagers also don't like outsiders much less than police doing official crime investigations in their town. The island is known for it's extreme bountiful produce production and there is a mysterious connection to their strong and open religious nature worshiping events during May. The villagers have fallen on hard times economically and have decided to make a virgin sacrifice to the nature Goddess by fire in hopes of changing things for the better. The Christian virgin police sergeant is to be ritually killed to benefit the island.*Special Stars- Christopher Lee, Britt Eckland, Diane Cilento, Ingrid Pitt, Edward Woodward.*Theme- People's religious beliefs are powerful matters.*Trivia/location/goofs- The famous nude Druid pagan fertility dance of Britt Eckland in her hotel room featured a body double. The filming local is Summerisle, a small island off the Western coast of Scotland. Much of the villagers were used in this film. Christopher Lee says he worked on this movie for no money and told of 'poor' Mr. Woodward being continually urinated down upon by a sacrificial goat placed in an upstairs cubical in the 'Wicker Man' set as he played his dramatic improvised burning sacrifice scenes. This film is the basis for the large counter culture event in the Nevadan desert called 'Burning Man'. Much of the songs and rituals of this film are not religiously accurate, but are of interest.*Emotion- An enjoyable but rather odd film of the Hippie era. Much of the pagan religious rituals featured are based in early British pre-history. They hold some charm initially but get creepier as the film progresses. Much of the film is an old fashioned morality play reminiscent of the Medieval Period just updated to today's modern milieu. This film was a big attraction to people working in the Renaissance Faire phenomena due to its' crossover belief systems of springtime farming gods and their rituals of the English pre-history",

He also sees things happening that are so out of place, such as naked couples presumably fornicating on the grass at night, yet he never mentions it. Honest to god, I don't think I've ever seen such a dumb movie. Not to mention that Woodward is a terrible actor.You will certainly laugh when people start singing and dancing in this film. The music is laughably bad. At one point you think you are watching a Monty Python skit. Maybe this is supposed to be a comedy. You do get to see Britt Ekland naked and dancing around which is pretty risqu\u00e9 for a 70's film. That's about all this film has going for it.

            "content": "'The Wicker Man' (1973) is one of my favourite films. I'm Pagan and know that some people don't like the inaccurate portrayal of Pagans in this film. But as the film is a work of fiction, I think we can enjoy the story without comparing it to any branch of Paganism, modern or historical.I recommend the director's cut over the theatrical. The director's cut adds a lot of atmosphere and character development.This is where the spoilers will start...The image used for most of the physical and digital promotion is great if you've seen the film, but could be a spoiler for anyone who hasn't.'The Wicker Man' follows a Christian police officer going to an island to investigate a report of a missing girl. Only when he gets to the island does he realise everyone on the island is a Pagan who wants to sacrifice him in a giant wicker man to ensure a good harvest.Starring Christopher Lee, Edward Woodward, Britt Ekland, and Ingrid Pitt, it feels very much like a Hammer film even though it isn't one. I see this as a good thing because Hammer created a classic style that draws the viewer in.'The Wicker Man' is a fairly slow moving film and I wouldn't say any of the visuals are scary, but the story itself could be. For the story to be scary you just have to believe there are people in an isolated area who want to kill strangers.So what makes 'The Wicker Man' a good film when compared to more modern examples of a group of people trying to kill strangers like 'House of 1000 Corpses'? In my opinion, the lack of gore. Now don't get me wrong, I love gory films. I'll happily watch films just for cool gore effects. But gory films aren't often the ones that leave a lasting fear in my mind. The more special effects a film has, the less realistic it tends to look in years to come. Everything in 'The Wicker Man' still looks real. But some of the effects in 'House of 1000 Corpses' have aged badly enough to be funny. I love 'House of 1000 Corpses', by the way, I just can't honestly say it still looks as good as it did when it came out. Nothing in 'The Wicker Man' takes me out of the story.The end scene in 'The Wicker Man' in particular manages to be haunting and unforgettable without the need for overly graphic gore or violence. They had one shot at getting that scene because they only had one wicker man. The animals and Edward Woodward are actually in the wicker man for some of those shots. Forced perspective is used for the rest as they obviously didn't kill Edward Woodward or the animals.Modern horror films tend to have much faster pacing so 'The Wicker Man' probably won't appeal to those who expect faster pacing and jump scares. However, it will leave you with the horrific idea that you would be powerless against a group of people wanting to kill you.",

Although the twist at the end wasn't actually that bad and slightly makes up for the boring precursor. What I also found annoying in The Wicker Man was the outrageously, sinfully bad dubbing that was extremely distracting and cringe inducing. The main character was also rather infuriating, I found him irritating and difficult to empathise with; although rather gallant in the face of a group of people seem to not to care about the disappearance of a little girl. What annoyed me most about him was the fact that during the earlier parts of the film, he rides into town he has never been before, upon his high horse and believing just because he is part of the law he automatically achieves almost god like status among the town folk, and uses it as an excuse to constantly speak to them through snide remarks and impatient demands.It seems the internet is filled with admirers of this horror flick, but I cease to find the charm in this lacklustre bore fest. I strongly beg you not to waste your time watching it; you will probably find more scares in an episode of Goose bumps, than you would in this mess.

It is incredibly funny (watching it with an audience really brings that home), very thoughtful, sensual and strange. Rough around the edges it certainly is, but it contains should-have-been award worthy performances by Edward Woodward (from arrogance to disquiet to true panic and horror - the best thing he has ever done) and a cheerfully, sinister Christopher Lee (who says that it is the best thing he has ever done - he might well be right.)It's a masterpiece.

There are only woman in the island, which makes it more plausible for the inhabitants to choose Cage to the sacrifice. Bad things: The plot isn't very entertaining so the film gets annoying after the 40 minutes. Also, Cage is an annoying actor and we feel it's Hollywood in almost every single scene.All in all, both versions of \"The Wicker Man\" are good and deserved to be seen, but none of them are able to be labeled as a classic.",

            "content": "Wicker man excibits qualities that are rare to find in a Hollywood cult movie or in any cult movie for the matter. There is something truly unique and individual about the aesthetic feel of this movie that makes it stand out as folklorist and outwordly.The movie runs at one and a half hour long and it is really staight to the point from start to finish. (In contrast with the american remake). The opening scene lays out splendidly the psychological structure of an ultra religious catholic cop without even saying a word. It then proceeds directly to our point of interest - the island. Although you could argue that the long music cuts are a bit off putting and make the movie feel a bit over the top and querky I believe that they beautyfully set the pace and the overall atmosphere of the eerie pagan community. The end scene in just a candy for the eyes and doesn't exaggerate the tragic finale but rather leaves us with the a feeling of awe and mystery.The music is another strong aspect of the movie, a psych cult folk masterpiece great for lovers of this post-60s era. Sometimes it's greatest advantage can also turn into a big disadvantage. Considering the level of craftsmanship in these songs it's wierd that Giovani never released anything other than this OST.Christopher Lee delivers the baritone awesomeness that you would have come to expect from him with witty comebacks and remarkable philosophical insights. His monologue in the scene with the slugs is where the films peak for me in terms development of the cult's philosophical background.Having seen the other reruns of this theme (american one, and loosely midsommar) i believe that the lore and the concepts of this movie strike as more folklorish, dark and medieval. The trinity of the fool, the woman and the dragon gives me deep pagan symbolic quality that none of the reruns have. Also the inkeepers daughter.....Definitely worth seeing for the cult film lovers and not only.",

I then remember watching a Channel 4 series of Cult Films in the 1980s as a teen, and this was one of them and I sat through it all. It blew me away. \nThis is one of very few films that made an impact on me then and to this day 30 years later I still have it up there in my top 10. \nEverything about it for me works. It has a sense of realism, a believable scenario of that time. A unique film, that does not sit into any genre or category. It is very unsettling and for the first view difficult to know where it is going, but you want to stick with it. It builds on and finally grabs you and takes you to its harrowing finale. A British masterpiece.",

            "review_title": "Paganism at its funniest (not quite its finest)!!!",
            "content": "My husband and our best friend and I had never even heard of this movie before the year 1997.  We found it listed in a small book about Celtic paganism that we were thumbing through and then the three of us went on a mad search of video stores to find it. We just had to see it...a movie about paganism!  We were certain, however, that like most films, it would paint our faith in a really bad light.And I guess to some people, it did.  What with the final scene of Edward Woodward............. But it was all for a good cause...wasn't it?Seriously, this movie was good clean fun...just like most Christians would say about the Spanish Inquisition scene in Mel Brooks' \"History of the World, Part I.\"  I'll agree...it was a funny movie, but what Christians don't realize or understand is that was a really sad, brutal time for people who were not Christian.  But back to \"The Wicker Man\"...I find that this movie is an attention getter from the very beginning.  Of course, this was in part because the three of us who were watching it are pagan to begin with.  We wanted to see this portrayed in a movie.  And we wanted it to be positive.As I said, some would argue that the pagans were the \"good guys\" of the movie.  Most would say that Neil Howie (Woodward) was the hero who unfortunately meets his end bravely while being used as the sacrifice of a group of barbaric heathens.  Others would realize that it's Howie's self-righteous attitude and closed minded beliefs that bring about his martyr-like death.  And isn't that what certain people like...martyrs????One of the things that we especially loved about the movie was the fact that so many of the people had Nature-oriented names.  \"Rowen\" Morrison...\"Willow\" (played by blonde bomb-shell Britt Eckland)...and countless others.  The references to the hare(s) was another point that was great for those of us who understand the \"meanings\" behind their presence in just such a story.The idea of using ritual to aid in the fertility of the crops is not a new idea.  It's one that dates back to as far as there was people on this planet.  Ritual sacrifice is a part of it.  The burning of the sacrificial candidate (Howie/Woodward) was integral to the people of Summerisle.  Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee) leads the ritual drama and finally the sacrifice itself, promising the people of his island that the crops will be fertile and plenty again for the following year.  A sacrifice like this was performed, according to history, throughout many different cultures. Egyptians, Greeks, Celts (as in this movie), Aztecs and even the Biblical Jews...remember Abel the shepherd and all the other sacrificial lambs that meant prosperity in the coming months?  What about Abraham and his son Isaac?  Or even better...Jesus allowing himself to be killed for the sins of his followers?  The ultimate sacrifice.I guess what I'm trying to say (without getting into the nitty-gritty details of a bunch of history) is that this is a great film.  It has it's typical 1970s cheesy moments, of course, but it represents paganism with heart and spirit and shows that Nature is to be respected.  Above all else, it is a movie about honoring Mother Earth...with a few laughs along the way.\nI highly recommend this film.  Both for pagans and for Christians.  Despite the big sacrifice scene at the end (which by the way, most pagans DON'T do these days...sacrifices are not a common practice of ours anymore...), it offers a way to understand the beliefs which are otherwise feared and hated because they are so different.  And it does it in a manner that is easily understood.",

            "review_title": "\"The Best British Horror Film\"",
            "content": "This is one of my favourite films. It well deserves its accolade of \"the best British horror film\".It was shown on ITV last new year's eve and I believe the one before. Is this to become a tradition? Interestingly the shorter version was shown the last time rather than the director's cut. I prefer the shorter version (even though the reason for this brevity on its initial release was damage limitation, the producers considering it one of the worst films ever made), because it gives it one of the most beautiful opening scenes of a movie ever, the flight over the Scottish islands with the enchanting folk soundtrack. \"The Wicker Man\" deserves this dramatic beginning, as elucidating as the preamble in the director's cut may be.Whose side are you on personally? Some root for the joyous animist islanders; some egg on the stern but incorruptible \"Christian copper\". Personally, on first viewing, I lost all sympathy with the Islanders upon the revelation that their religion was not something that had somehow survived continuously from the misty past, as I had assumed, but had been imposed on them just a century before by an upper class Victorian eccentric.The conflict between the diametric opposites, the AMBIVALENCE is what makes the film so poignant, and I think a quick look at the background of its creator, the successful screenwriter Anthony Shaffer, is pertinent. Anthony Shaffer was the twin brother of the playwright Peter Shaffer, who later eclipsed him with \"Equus\" and \"Amadeus\", both great plays made into films. In the film of \"Equus\" the shrink played by Richard Burton bemoans the loss of primal ecstasy that curing the boy of his psychosis entails - this is so close to the theme of \"The Wicker Man\". In \"Amadeus\" the contrast is between the pedestrian competence of the dignified Salieri and the divine inspiration of the ribald Mozart (sibling rivalry between A. and P. respectively?)",

The time I devoted to trying to find this film, plus the hours spent watching it, amount to me kicking myself for listening to the film-snob reviewers before me.

Heck, I didn't know what to make of Britt Ekland, prancing and tapping about nekked, warbling some strange Celtic lyrics while trying to scissor her bedroom wall. Either I was already bored with the movie in the first 20 minutes--and Britt's boobs couldn't wake me up--or I found all the public humpy/grindy by the villagers in public an embarrassing turnoff.This is, in Judith Crist's words, \"an old-fashioned movie, and not a good old-fashioned.\" Police constable Edward Woodward flies out to an island off the coast of Scotland because he wants to follow up on a missing-child report. Woodward's character, about the thickest copper you could ever hope to hoodwink, can't get over just how weird and kinky the villagers are. He prays and prays and then walks by what must be a dozen couples copulating on the lawn across from the local watering hole. You can almost hear him saying to himself, \"I'm not seeing this, not, not, not!\"The scene looks like a birthing class for pregnant couples, way, way too early.As the story unfolds, Woodward gets more frustrated, sweatier, angrier, and begins to smell like a dead rabbit (don't ask). The ending is, well, sort-of predictable, but I did appreciate that Woodward's Christian faith is tested but doesn't break. He is, despite his stolidity, a hero in the true Christians-versus-lions-in-the-Colosseum tradition.What I can't understand is why this movie has such street cred. It's clunky and dull, the main character has the personality of kelp, and Britt Ekland, all cute and perky, is just so much eye-candy. A mannequin with nipples would have sufficed.Go figure.",

The 2006 remake is rife with meme-tactic moments in what could be Cage's most insane role to date. NOT THE BEES! Indeed. But the 1973 film it was based upon does such an incredible job in unsettling it's viewers, it's a wonder that it was ever remade in the first place, let alone poorly. It's touted as one of the scariest films of the 70's. To compare this to a film of late, definitely refer to Midsommar by Ari Aster. A devotedly catholic policy sergeant goes on a mission to find a missing girl in a remote village on an island off the coast of Scotland. This island, unbeknownst to him, is inhabited by a pagan death cult. What starts as a routine investigation turns into a hostage situation as the pagans of the island entrap our protagonist into their web of harmonious chaos, culminating in a virgin sacrifice inside of a male effigy, literally, made out of wicker. I came out of this understanding it as a metaphor for the loss of organized religion and morals in the modern age. I came into it knowing it was a horror classic, but not expecting the large array of original songs. Technically, The Wicker Man could be classified as a musical. Lots of singing, and dancing.. oh, and nudity. The climactic ending is truly and epic feat in psychological horror, and if anything, will make you look at Burning Man a whole lot differently.",

I was at a movie show a few years ago and was fortunate enough to see Ingrid Pitt. I bought the DVD as it was cheap at the same show and give it another chance. I don't know what it was but second time around with no expectation of a 'classic horror' hanging over it I was enchanted. First of all was the music. fantastic beautiful music in which the highlight is most certainly Willows Song in which the stunning and naked Britt Ekland temps the virgin Christian Edward Woodward. Then there is the acting. All play their roles well - Christopher Lee is always great, Britt Ekland is simply delicious enough to eat but the real performance is from Edward Woodward. Such a mannered, carefully presented performance right up to the end when he really comes into his own as a terrified man realising he is the victim of a cruel game and facing his own death. The movie almost has a false sense of security - you never really think these people who are so happy, open and free would commit such a crime. But as Mr Woodwards character is led over the hill to his doom towards the towering wicker man we realise the true horror in the story. I would not describe The Wicker Man as a horror.

            "content": "I detest most religions and religious beliefs so it was easy for me to cheer for the Heathen islanders, even if they were a bit wacky. Edward Woodward's uptight, self righteous police officer, Sergeant Howie, is a barely sympathetic character, entirely confined and controlled by his demented, pointless Christian faith, and therefor is the perfect target for some devious, mean spirited, soul testing pranks. Christopher Lee is compelling as the aristocratic wizard, his innate sinister yet sophisticated charm perfectly suited for his role as gracious host of his private island's Pagan Party. Few other actors could so effectively generate such a charismatic image of formidable worldliness. Think of a more modest, more homey Gandalf.There's a very memorable scene of a very gorgeous and very nude Britt Ekland writhing in possessed, ritualistic desire. The risqu\u00e9 scene functions not just as a salacious exploitation of Brit's sensuous physique but also as a stylized Rorschach test by which we are very emphatically prompted to measure our own level of prurient repression. Sexual desire, as Christianity would have us believe, is unnatural and evil. Ha! Some of the dialog, especially in the later half, is unnecessarily deliberate and expository - it would have been much more mysterious and suspenseful to not have the motives and meanings so literally explained. Heathenism, even more so than Christianity, embraces irrational, nonlinear thought and so it isn't necessary to have the pagan islander's ideas and actions any more comprehensible than those of the good Detective's. In fact, I much prefer my Paganism entirely inscrutable, thank you.The finale is positively gruesome, aesthetically inspired, and undeniably satisfying. In spite of it's modest flaws - the most obvious one being why the islanders would bother to continue to deceive the Detective once he's trapped on their island - this nasty little thriller will definitely tickle your spiritual funny bone.",

The fact that the music for me is one off the most important thing a movie can have. Bad music that doesn't fit the picture is a real disaster. Music and pic. Should be one. Is this the case the movie has already a fifty fifty change to be a good movie. And this counts certainly for The Wicker Man. The music of this movie is just superb. We gat Celtic/ Folk music as the flower 60 hippie like tinted music as even a 'Italian copper flick sound' in it. Marvellous. First thing I did after I saw for the first time the movie a few days ago, was ordering the soundtrack of The Wicker Man. Even as the movie there exists two versions of it. Also a nice scene in the movie now I'm talking about the music is the one in the 'Green Man' pub. When all the villagers start singing when Sergt. Howie walks in. This scene gets a certain Disney set-up feeling I think that is really enjoyable. The movie was intended to be a musical. This feeling shows in the 'Tree' (symbol of the p\u00b0nis) scene in front off the school/library.I saw the theatrical version as the extended version. I think in my humble opinion the most valuable version of this movie is the extended version. Because the beginning of both movies is completely different. I found it valuable info the letter Sergt. Howie gets at the police station in the beginning of the movie. The letter about 'Rowan Morrison' especially for him. Extended version gives you this info the other one doesn't. But this is the reason why the policeman goes over to the island. We know already at this point why !!! And so should it be.The acting in this movie is one of the best I ever have seen. One off the strongest conversation and acting in this movie was when Lord Summerisle, as a cool sect leader annoyed Sergt. Howie in his believing. As a true Christen.' What of the true God?'- 'He's dead, he had his change, he blew it', marvelous scene. The acting here is one of the strongest I ever saw. You could feel the disgust and anger of Howie because the Lord touched him deeply in a brutal way in his believe.Also this movie, and this is a great thing a love on certain movies is that real 70 ties feeling. Well this movie has it. The scene that the landlord's daughter starts banning the walls. Love this scene because of the feeling and atmosphere that (again) the music here creates. Psychedelica first rate. Mostly a stand-in does this scene.There are a lot of moments a really gat the creeps. For instance the children carrying the doll ' We carry dead out of the village' Also a real psychedelic frightening feeling settles, at the point Howie wants to leave the island and the animal faces pop-up and this again in combination with strange bizarre music. Not to forget the 'Horseman clapping his teeth did give ma the chills as well, KNAP.KNAP. The movie has also some marvelous details, like the coffin shaped oven plate.The plot of the movie isn't certainly not predictable. When he sets the girl free, even at that point I didn't know how the story would turn. In the way of 'The hunter is the one who's gonna be hunted'. I thought for a moment he could walk away out of the awkward situation. But the fool, the king had to bring his payment to the villagers and even (his) God can't save him here, out of this gruesome sacrifice he had to undergo. He didn't let go of his believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, bud no one could save him from the Wicker Man not even Jesus Christ himself.There are three little mistakes I spotted in the movie, but heyyyyyy what are these little mistake sin this great movie. NOTHING. Just wanted to mention them. That's all. 1/ In the pub the landlord's daughter goes into the door, to fix a room for Sergt. Howie. But a second shot later she stands next to this door singing with the other lads.2/ If you look close you will see the stand-in's face in the bedroom scene when she is hitting her bottom.3/ Girls dancing around the fire aren't naked. While Lord Summersville in the castle makes a clear statement about why they are naked to Sergt. Howie. ' It's to dangerous Sergt. Jumping through fire with your clothes on'.So in a certain way I just wanted to say, this is one hell of a good movie and I'm a little ashamed I waited all those years. But gladly I did it. And many times will follow in the future. This is a real must to see and I would even dare to say 9/10 for me.Dario/",

I expected some kind of cannibal holocaust, wild cruel rites in some dark and remote African, Amazonian or New Guinea settlement. Far from it, we are in a Scottish offshore island, and about to meet a community of neopagans who live happily a rather free and morally relaxed style of life following old pagan rites mixed with Scottish traditions, and spiced with traditional folk music; hippies of the 60's-70's would have loved to live there! Technically the film has its flaws, but the last scene offers something very original which we have hardly ever watched in cinema. Forget about its classification as a \"horror film\", it is not, actually there are many more moments for laugh than frightening ones, yet an atmosphere of mystery is present throughout the film.The plot is essentially a mystery about the disappearance of a girl from the community, the investigation of a just arrived policeman, and the lack of cooperation from the dwellers. There is a very interesting final twist, just before the remarkable last scene.But there is more it. The film contains several layers actually, and below the surface there is a very interesting clash of religious beliefs, and a reflection on the role religion and believing in the supernatural plays in the society (be it the promise of an afterlife made by someone who died in a cross or the belief in reincarnation on the grounds of the natural cycle of life and the gods that govern it all). It was my impression that neither of both are given much credit in the film, so maybe it does contain some kind of subtle atheistic message.In summary, a highly recommended film. The fact that there has been two recent remakes of it (both failed attending to the opinions of IMDb's reviewers) is indicative of the interest and influence The Wicker Man still conserves three decades later.",

'Sleuth'(1972) (Anthony Schaffer's previous work) is one of my favourite films of all time, and naturally I was quite excited about seeing this film. This film does share some similarities to 'Sleuth'(1972) with regard to sick, violent, and bleak satire, and also, the kind of 'Comedia Del Arte' elements such as the use of theatre masks and colourful, medieval costumes.Edward Woodward is exceptional as Seargeant Howie assigned to find the 'missing girl', and Christopher Lee back again to play another villain.One thing I loved about this film was the constant alienation technique involving song and dance. This brightens up the atmosphere of the film, but at the same time, manages to keep it bleak and mysterious.I definitely recommend this film to anyone to enjoys musical theatre, religious horror/thrillers, and fans of 'Sleuth'(1972).4 STARS.",

Christopher Lee acted his part Pro-Bono as he saw the potential. Interestingly he is a central character, referred to from the beginning, but not actually seen until halfway through. The Wicker Man combines horror, spiritualism, music and eroticism in a seamless and beautiful way to truly form a work of art. It pushes the envelope of these themes, even by today's standards and deserves to be more widely recognized. I would highly recommend this film. 9/10",

It is not suspenseful, it is not scary. I would hesitate to call it a horror movie as many have.It is not erotic despite the nudity involving attractive women. All the nudity and attempts at being erotic are either gratuitous/surplus even non-sequitur or attempt to contribute to the strangeness/shock value without really succeeding. Leaving most of it out would have improved the movie.The plot is thin and simple. There is an anti-Christian aspect to it which was and is so common that it comes across as stock formula.The acting is nothing memorable although a few people succeed at coming across as suspicious. But when that is almost everyone, it doesn't mean much. Edward Woodward is good but his work is wasted. If the rest of the movie had been better constructed. his performance would have been elevated. Given the surrounding material, his work withers. Christopher Lee has a couple of short interesting moments and I understand that he likes his role in this movie but frankly, it doesn't add up to too much. Diane Cilento is effective but doesn't actually do much in total. Britt Ekland was there as a sexual object.

Now before I carry on, I ain't picking on other styles of horror I am stating a point.  One other thing I like about English horrors is the endings.  There's always some fancy twist that screws with your mind.To the film...Christopher Lee...Superb.  Probably his greatest role.  He plays the role so well.  The film dabbles into paganism which adds the element of fear.  This works particularly well as most horror's do in relation to this subject.  There is also this weird crazy element about the film which gives the viewer the sense of the unknowing.  I also believe that the director wants us to be Edward Woodward in this film.  It treats us as it does him.  When watch I'll think you'll understand my meaning.I also read somewhere that some people class this film as a MUSICAL. Shocked, I read this theory and eventually agree with it.  It might be hard to see but why can't a horror film be a musical.  The songs are a little crazy but they have a kind of magic about them.

In some ways subtle and in some ways in-your-face with strangeness, this film is a surprising tale of good vs. evil - with evil winning in the end.A devout Christian police officer, Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) arrives in the island of Summerisle, searching for a missing girl. The locals deny knowing her, but as his stay on the island progresses he sees many strange things happening as time moves on to May Day. He follows many scattered breadcrumbs throughout the film and eventually realizes that he was trapped all along with no one to comfort or save him.This film was enjoyable because we, as an audience, were with the police sergeant throughout the entire feature. We knew only what he knew and were as baffled as he was with the strange ways of the village; such as the exceedingly inappropriate discussion at the local school, the animal masks that are worn frequently and the naked girls dancing and singing over a bonfire.With the horror occurring in the daytime, in front of an entire community and in a nice village (that you may even go to for your holidays), this film throws you off the scent with its many anti-conventions. The stereotypes of the genre are almost completely overthrown to create this twisted, terrifying piece of cinema.The final scene was particularly horrific; ending with the Sergeant Howie burning to death as a sacrifice in the Wicker Man. Reminiscent of the death of Jesus Christ, Howie sings praises to God and prays to be saved as he is burned to death - one man against many. This is a sad, yet powerful ending - again using the anti-conventions in the sense that the villains won this time.I strongly recommend seeing this film. Christopher Lee himself said that his role as Lord Summerisle was one of the best roles he had ever had.",

Also, it was quite predictable. Hmmm, if everyone in the town is a nut, what are the chances the girl won't be one too? When the cop finds her and at first she is smiling, it was obvious she wasn't scared and easy to infer what would happen next. I had heard this had a good ending and even that was far from good- it didn't show anything, only animals screaming and the cop spewing Jesus crap. If what happened at the very end of this movie actually happened to you or someone you know it would obviously suck, but it didn't make for an exciting or creepy movie. All of this was supposed to have been because they couldn't get their crops to grow for one year?! LOL Maybe they had way too much beer at 'Mr. Weirdo's' Inn/Bar- that could have caused most of the stupid things that happened in this movie.I'd recommend Silent Hill instead...it has plot similarities in that a crazy group of people does some very bad things crediting their odd religious beliefs, but has a much better plot, effects, and is genuinely engaging, dark, and creepy- like a nightmare in which you take a trip to Hell itself.",

Christopher Lee is great as Lord Summerisle, sweet and charming until crossed (though the hairstyle left a bit to be desired). I found some of the music to be slightly annoying at first, but it kind of grows on you after the second or third viewing...I found myself humming the maypole song and \"Corn Rigs\" for some time (not to mention Willow's song).

What he encounters is a town full of eccentric and downright strange people, all under the rule of Lord Summerisle (a commanding Christopher Lee). Time reveals to Howie, a devout christian, that he is in a town full of paganists. I will leave everything else in the film up to the viewer. It's all too good to give away here.

So I'll give it that, but nothing more, this movie is NOT scary, it is by no conceivable means shocking, unless (as other reviewers have pointed out well before me) you are somehow shocked and appalled by naked women and people not believing in god, and basically half the movie is hippies singing old folky songs.

It is possible, indeed, somewhat... likely that convinced Christians may shirk at some stage, may claim the film is a hatchet job on fundamentalist Christians such as one Sgt. Neil Howie. Anthony Shaffer's script for this film seems to be quite an achievement. He manages to maintain an ambiguity (well, if one ignores the implicit) in his authorial tone towards the Pagan and Christian faiths and viewpoints that leave the film open to innumerable countenances. While even this 100 or so minute cut of the film proves a veritable collaboration of disparate elements - the musical, the suspense thriller, the billowing black comedy, the sexual rumination... it does merge to the effect of a tumbling orchestra : an epiphany of appropriate ambiguity and dark mirth, at least at its close.Woodward's Howie is perfectly pitched; a closed-minded, indignant innocent, pray to a broader scheme. His downfall seems ignoble, his portrayal is as a pathetic little man unwilling to the nth degree to countenance the ways of Summerisle : Howie is far from a hero, with whom a prospective audience can identify. The pathetic nature of the character is not without pathos, however, as the conclusion plies its spell. The film is a delectable inspiration of macabre delights : from the insidious, nigh-on knowing connivance of the villagers to befuddle the hapless Howie, to the arch, fitting symbolism drenching many a frame, to the \"decor minimaliste\" of the ladies... it's a film languourously intent on a precise purpose; questioning the viewer's imposed repose - putting forth the implication that Christianity is merely righteous chicanery. I am well won over, to a degree, to the island's side, as opposed to the self-confident, staid Howie. The portrayal of Paganism is far from unattractive; indeed 'tis embellished with libidinous and communal fortitudes. Isle Summerisle's macabre manipulation of Messr. Howie is masterfully evoked,  emphasized especially with the scene on the last morning where his boat malfunctions...\nThe players ply their trade effectively; Woodward puts not a jot out of place in his crucial role; Lee is satisfactory in his way, if not brilliant, as Lord Summerisle. The minor parts are all more than adequately performed, with Diane Cilento resplendent where some are tellingly hersuite.I must commend this picture for its use of music, mood and mummery to ingrain a baffled indulgence on its viewers; if you are of the agreeable sensibility, you'll damn well love this film... Pray... try it, my friend.Rating:- **** 1/2/*****",

I also saw a few pictures, like the hand of glory beside the bed, and assumed it was a scary movie from beginning to end.\nBut then I got the chance to actually watch it. I don't remember my first reaction to it, I wasn't upset. I was probably more perplexed in the direction it was going, and also the musical nature of this film. But it was an intriguing journey.\nThen comes the horrific ending! That's where the horror of this movie actually lies. The protagonist in this movie played by Edward Woodward acts more like an antagonist. He doesn't come across as being very sympathetic. But still, by the end of the film, you do feel bad for him, to put it mildly lol.\nI've got the DVD of the wooden box, which contained an interesting documentary about the saga of this film. It's not the making of this film that's interesting, but the fate of the negatives. I wonder if someone wasn't upset with this film and deliberately had it destroyed? That's the conspiracy theorist in me.\nI've also watched and owned different versions, including the Media VHS, which has a longer intro showing Sgt Howie's life, and his reputation with his fellow officers, prior to leaving for Summer Isle. The theatrical version just starts with him flying to Summer Isle, but has a few scenes from that beginning section later in the movie, as a flashback. All versions work, it's just a shame the director's original vision was never realised since the negatives were trashed.\nOne of the best films of the horror genre, without so much as a drop of blood. The Wicker Man is a rare gem of a film.",

It is a brilliant invention of an \"alternative universe\" in modern time on one lonely Scottish isle, where the residents have reverted to the religion and customs of Ancient Britain.  Beautifully plotted, directed and acted as a \"murder mystery,\" it has a stodgy but sympathetic police sergeant as its hero and a tremendous cast of quirky eccentrics, the island's residents, who out-maneuver him at every turn. The locale, Summerisle, is lovingly created down to the last detail, including quite a bit of delicious pseudo-folk music by a group called \"Lodestone\" (aka \"Magnet\") and some fine humorous touches.  One of the best British productions of the 1970s, it should not be missed. This is not a children's film, so see the 95 to 98 minute version which is much the best edit. Though it contains suggestive language and disturbing ideas, there is no real violence or sex that would be offensive to a thoughtful adult. The original (85 mins.) release  destructively cut 10 minutes, partly from the heart of the story, presumably to outguess the censor.  Those cuts can not be justified even by the \"tighter\" standards of the 1960s, which produced much more salacious and violent stuff, particularly in the \"spy\" genre.",

But aside some of the elements were quite well done, and it was suspenseful and horrific in and anticipatory kind of way.No druids dispensing wisdom, no heroic cattle or woman stealing raids, just dark conspiracy.  This was done as a commercial film venture to make money. Notice that none of the respected folk rock bands of the era are represented -- no Fairport Convention or Pentangle.  This was a formula horror movie. And the horror was that the conspiracy against this self-righteous self-important uninvited do-gooder was plain as day but his devotion to his duty made him heroically and tragically persevere.  Remember, tragedy must be self-induced by a desire to play God, and this one follows the formulas.I couldn't help thinking, as I first watched this movie, how much this film owed to the tongue in cheek approach to B horror movies of that era.  By all means not a film for children, but if you are having one of those days where you get just sick of that variety of Christians who've never read a holy book not even their own, shoving their self righteous delusions into your unwilling face.... Better yet invite some Christians over to watch it, and serve them a roast suckling baby pig but don't eat any yourself; tell them you're a vegetarian but this baby piggy was sacrificed just for them...Honestly, this movie is about as close as this society can get to displaying a contemporary pagan society, and it does so with some cheesy self-satire. But the theme and lesson the imperialist west learned in that era is aptly portrayed by the inhabitants of the land of eternal summer, the Celtic euphemism for the land on the other side.

It tells the tale of a police constable assigned to investigate the murder of a young girl- and when he reaches the island, is digraced at the lack of Christianity that the inhabitants refuse to follow- instead, they focus their attention on worshipping Satan. The police constable- who accuses them of blasphemy- believes their is a link in the attitude of the locals to the missing child, and pretty soon these accusations turn into murder.\nQuite why actor Edward Woodward (great name!) is not recognised in other films is a mystery, as he puts on such a believable performance it makes the final 'twist' in the tale (which must have had an influence on Se7en) all the more tragic, yet it could'nt have ended on a more fitting note. The style of the film itself is beautifully restrained, and focuses more on the deranged, twisted attitudes the locals have, their clash with the police constable, and the authoritative presence of Lord Summerisle (played with gleefull menace by Christopher Lee, who claims this to be his favourite film). A subtle masterpiece of hypocrisy, religous propoganda and liberalist attitudes which climaxes with genuine horror 10/10.",

What he finds is a strange and sometimes perverse sub-culture practising what appears to be ancient paganistic rituals. As a devout Christian, Howie is not only offened, but highly disgusted by the inhabitants and this brings a ruthless determination to get to the bottom of the mystery.The tension builds as Howie slowly uncovers the strange ways of the townfolk and the relationship that the mystery has with the unusual practises of the same.No more spoilers, suffice to say that in the climax when Howie finally comes to meet the Wicker Man, Woodward turns in one of the most moving performances I can recall seeing in a long time.

            "content": "I saw this film for the first time recently, and was intrigued by the themes in the film, notably the information on pagan philosophy etc.I will not comment on the technical aspects of the film, as they have been covered in other reviews, though I must say I thought Woodward in particular played his role very well.I think any viewer knew \"something bad\" was in store for Howie when his seaplane failed to start when he wanted to return to the mainland for reinforcements ! What I do want to say is this. I am a Christian, and for me the most ironic part of the whole film was when the pagan Lord (Christopher Lee) said to Howie \"you know nothing about real sacrifice.\" The great irony is that Howie knew more about real sacrifice than ANY of the island people, as he knew the Lord Jesus Christ had died for his sins in His sacrificial death. And that though he died a painful death, Howie ultimately had the \"last laugh\" as he would be with the Lord forever...whereas unless the pagans repented of their evil deeds, they would be damned forever.I think the film makers \"acknowledged\" something of this when we see Howie about to die in the Wicker Man at the end of the film. Although the islanders were celebrating etc we also see Howie praying and praising God, knowing that when he died he would be with the Lord Jesus Christ. And I believe the film-makers captured something of this paradoxical hope and joy that Howie had. (Reminded me of the Protestant martyrs who were burnt at the stake under Queen Mary.) I also appreciated the tactic Howie used to try and appeal to the islanders when he was about to be taken to his death. He appealed to them that by killing him would NOT guarantee a good harvest - and then he used the tactic of saying \"and if you do not get a good harvest, then next year you will have to sacrifice your leader\" (referring to Christopher Lee.) For a few seconds, you could see Lee realising what Howie said was true, and had a look of fear - but quickly hid this by saying \"but we WILL get a good harvest this year !\" and then encouraging everyone to continue taking Howie to his death.So, I think the real twist of this film is that though the islanders SEEM to have won, it is actually Howie who gets the real victory.",

Here are some stanzas that differ from those in the film:I was the happiest of the Clan; Sair, fair may I repine; For Donald was the bravest man, And Donald, he was mine.Till Charlie Stewart came at last, Sae far to set us free; My Donald's arm was wanted then, For Scotland and for me.Thou woeful fate what can I tell? Right to the wrong did yield; My Donald and our Country fell Upon Culloden field.Second, the film is excellent. It disturbed me, even though I have known about it and its famous ending for years. Actors and actresses who are not native Scots do a reasonably good job with the distinctive Scottish accent. It is interesting to see the remarkable Christopher Lee as a fairly youthful middle-aged man. It is also interesting to see Edward Woodward, whom I had previously viewed only in 'The Equalizer,' splendidly playing the role of the baffled, ethical Sergeant Howie. The conversations of Lee and Howie are brilliant. The conclusion of the film is terrifying.Third, people who note that the film is dated or that it is not a true horror movie should remember that film dates quickly and that, as other commentators have remarked, The Wicker Man does not fit into any single category, a fact that is one of its strengths.Finally, since much, perhaps most, of my blood is Celtic, I shall make the following observation. Presumably Julius Caesar invented the legend of the Wicker Man in order to convince Rome and its various subjugated colonies that the Celts were more bloodthirsty than the Romans.

            "content": "It's a truly spectacular film and I'd say Britain's best horror film. The performances are all fantastic - some more than others. Edward Woodward gives an exceptional performance as devout Christian copper Sgt. Howie, he plays the role with a sort of innocence and likability, and is the character most of the audience are likely to relate to. He really shines throughout the film. Britt Ekland is also very well cast - although her experience making the film wasn't the best and she seems to regard the film very lowly, she still takes the character of Willow, the landlords daughter, on very well. She seems to represent the whole Pagan aspect of the film. Ingrid Pitt and Diane Cilento are welcome additions to the cast, but do not receive a lot of screen time and aren't overly crucial to the film. Christopher Lee remarks this as the best film he's starred in, and I would agree with him. He's terribly underused in the movie but the scenes he does feature in are some of the best. The music is very fitting and when I saw this the first time, was what really scared me. A lot of the songs tend to be mocking Howie and enhance the idea that everyone on the island of Summerisle is against him. Christopher Lee's duet with Diane Cilento of The Tinker of Rye, really stands out to me. The music is very powerful as it really lures the viewer into a false sense of security. The locations are stunning, and if made a point of visiting the ones I've not seen some point this summer. I'd say this movie really has to be seen with the deleted scenes intact, because the theatrical version leaves huge gaps to the story and cuts out a lot of brilliant dialogue between Woodward and Lee, and some further examples of the pagan practices in Summerisle. The Wicker Man is a prime example that, anyone can make a film on a small budget and it can still stand up against big budget rubbish that studios spout out, such as Neil laBute's horrific remake. I'm hoping Hardy's newest project Cowboys for Christ manages to keep this low budget, rural feel. Interesting that Don't Look Now & The Wicker Man were put into a B-Movie Double Bill and regarded as rubbish by the studios but now both stand out as two of the most chilling and powerful horror films ever.",

I can't say that I didn't like this film, nor can I say that it is a Classic horror film. Lord Summerisle(Christopher Lee) with a permanent, says this was one of his greatest roles, I can't say that I can agree with him, but you really have to judge for yourself.Sergeant Howie(Edward Woodward) in a good performance, keeps the film together, as the devout Christian policeman, who becomes a human marshmallow roast, so to speak. Sgt. Howie is sent to find a missing girl, only to learn of this bizarre behavior of the locals.Apparently, last years harvest didn't go so well, so the thinking of the local clan is a human sacrifice, and Edward fills the bill very nicely. For some reason, Scotland gets noticeable credit as the only filming location. Whatever , I never got a sense of surprise or horror, just aggravation or annoyance for not being able to find the missing girl.So, while this film gets HIGH ratings, just see it for yourself, at 88 minutes or the longer Directors cut, which give more BIOS on Sgt.

We have a Cristian devotee who is plunged into a world of old gods, superstitions and pagan rituals. The ideologies of the town's people and the sheer lack of concern over the missing child perplexes him. The way people of the town interacts him feels deliberate and feels almost as if they are taunting him, making a mockery of his religious belief. We see him praying at night and gradually being angry at the people around him. The way his character is shown is very interesting and I enjoyed it.In second part of the film, we are shown more bizarre side of the town and its people. By then I could feel the ultimate fate of our protagonist. Some scenes were really well made. I liked the dialogues. Songs were wonderful.I did not like the absence of horror element.

All the film is about is it sets on a Sergeant who comes to an island full of rituals and sacrificial killings, trying to locate a missing girl who the locals of the island claimed never existed. From there on, it's an unpredictable plot full of twists to whether this girl is real, alive, dead, fantasy or just a myth???? It could be any of those things and I'm not going to give away a cent of this thrilling film because you need to see it! All I can say is that this film is high on thrills, has many great mystery plots, contains it's level of violence and builds on the suspense throughout different scenes, with no music (only singing from the locals) creating a sense and feel of loneliness and isolation.Anyway, it's a classic and people need to see it and forget the remake. This film also let's you think and work out the different results in the actions that the Sergeant makes. The locals of the town give you the suspicion whether the Sergant should trust them and they're very unpredictable in their actions and the decisions they make throughout. It also plays with the mind, tending to let you continually point out what is going on. It's also very unpredictable and it will leave you shocked towards the end!!! The ending scene is the most unexpected and really leaves you in a web of questions! But nether the less it's worth it and definitely up there in the group of horrors and thrillers.It's also a rare gem and to me another one of those films which really go the two genres going. It's on the level of Black Christmas, Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Last House of the Left and of course Halloween. Just naming a few.

As I said, it's bleak and dark while being totally hypnotic. Like driving past a car wreck with fresh blood smears on the road, you're horrified but you just can't look away. Lurking beneath the murky surface is a sense of doom. The ending is disturbing in a way I have not seen before or since. I would not call this a horror film - at least, not in the traditional sense of the word. I'm not even sure if it can be probably categorized in one genre or another, and maybe it doesn't need to be. And let me clarify one thing: make no mistake, this is not a fun movie. It's not the thing you pop in when you're bored and looking to absentmindedly waste away an hour and forty minutes. The Wicker Man takes you by the throat with an icy grip and doesn't let go until long after the credits are over, if ever. It will remain with you for a very long time.

            "content": "Despite hearing a lot about this film as it was shot in Scotland, I've only just seen it. I knew it involved burning a huge wicker man as I've seen pictures in the newspapers etc. I knew the ending was special though I had no idea what happened.Now that I've seen it I love it, especially the non-Hollywood ending. I hate films such as Fatal Attraction which are morally shallow, and the all-too American solution which is simply to shoot the \"baddie\" (even though Michael Douglas' character in FA could arouse no sympathy in me). Some of the comments have been very judgmental, describing the islanders as \"weirdos\" just because they're not Christians. Tut tut.I must say that the film looks very dated, and the plot holes at times are ludicrous, and most have been mentioned before. But that didn't bother me. The mark of a good film is when it's still making me think a couple of days later.By the way according to the documentary which followed the TV screening of The Wicker Man, Annie Ross did the speaking as well as the singing I think.After going through most of the above comments it's difficult to say anything new.My main contribution has to be: why Scotland? Apparently the novel which started off the idea was based in Cornwall (in England) and the landscape of Cornwall would have been just as good (but they wouldn't have had an island setting).As a Scot watching this I was more sensitive than outsiders to the whole thing, and the idea of a whole island, with a pub and a Post Office and so on, but totally PRIVATE, is ludicrous. Under English law this might just about be possible, but in Scotland there is an almost universal right to roam, and most small islands are inhabited only by sheep, and larger ones full of tourists. Also the whole maypole/folk song thing comes across as very English, and as for cavorting naked in Scottish weather.........I kept thinking that the only people who would be likely to go in for the lifestyle in the film would be English incomers (and there are a good few places where dropouts/ hippies/goodlifers, call them what you will, have settled in Scotland), so the attempts at Scottish accents are a waste of time. Regarding accents, just where is the hotel landlord supposed to be from? His accent is about the weirdest ever. Woodward in comparison sounds quite convincing in his accent.I realise that for outsiders most of this will sound parochial (and many Americans on this board have struggled with the meanings of \"Scottish\", \"English\", and \"British\"). But apart from the terrific ending, these are my main impressions of the film. I would recommend that you see it and make up your own mind.",

I had no clue it was going to be completely absurd and not as overtly horrifying.The first half or so of the film just feels like dealing with a group of weirdos. I didn't get the sense of any impending doom for our puritanical copper until about the halfway point. The slow burn of learning bit by bit about this island and it's inhabitants is done really well.Everything about how Sergeant Howie interacts with everyone and everything is so funny. I love that the film depicts law enforcement and Christianity in comical ways. And I love how appalled this goober is by sexual competence and the rejection of his religion. It's fun to ridicule the guy until the film closes on a truly disturbing note.There really is nothing you can do in the face of groupthink and cult behavior.

I should have drunk or done drugs before watching this kaleidoscopic flick.Talk about an avant garde exercise in theatrical narcissism. This film is over the top.

The finale, while bizarre in itself, salvaged a 5-star rating as it finally tied the movie together. Recommended only if you are under the influence. About my reviews:I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.

It is certainly original, which is often a risk, but in this case it has certainly paid off and it's success, and recent remake, speaks for its self. It does not attempt to cash in on cheap thrills and jumps but instead aims to build up tension and mystery throughout by creating a society so far from our own which challenges all the taboos. As all the characters are made to seem odd the audience is forced to share PC Howie's sense of isolation which is emphasised through his physical and geographical isolation. The blend of well-known faces, Christopher Lee and Britt Ekland, as well as the Scottish islanders, means the audience doesn't know who to trust or suspect thus increasing the mystery. It's controversial subject matter and imagery have ensured it's success as a cult classic. You don't know what to expect from this film and can never predict what will happen next and that is really all you want from a horror film.

I know, this is bad. This, coupled with the fact that I had already seen the movie when I was young, meant that the best bit, the shock ending, was neither a shock, nor particularly emotionally affecting in any *other* way. Which I didn't expect. After all, this is supposed to be a horror classic.When the schoolteacher at the end of the movie says: \"You shall be *revered* and *anointed* as a king\" along with a neat, confirmatory nod of the chin to indicate the ceremonial appropriateness of this anointing, she could just as easily have been saying: \"You shall be *ritually burned alive* for being *irritating* public nuisance\" and it would have been just as good.Not that I'm advocating copper-torching. Far from it. It's just that the islanders come across as so ordinary and pleasant that the ending, far from being a horrendous shock, just looks... fake. Edward Woodward acts his little heart out, but everyone else looks like extras.Also, I have an ambivalence about the film's basic premise. As an adult I couldn't really take the film seriously as I regularly visit the Scottish islands and the idea of paganism bursting into bloom in a hundred or so years to the intensity necessary for this movie's plot seems now to be a dim-witted idea, much MUCH more dim-witted than it seemed when I was young. The Scottish Islands, particularly the far out, far up ones, are DEEPLY Christian. Although I suppose you could postulate that it's the depth of religion itself, whatever it is, that hangs around those distant beaches and mountains. Certainly they are soul-stirring places... Meh. Dunno. That spiritual aura is there in the islands themselves, and the movie seems to tell of it a little in the images and music... but going there in reality is better.I do rather like Christopher Lee's little speech about animals. That was well-written, and, though very much of the time, contained sentiments that one might keep close to one's heart without *too* much danger of developing a law-enforcement officer incineration tendency, I would hope.5 stars. 1 for the acting, which *was* good, very good in places, 1 for Christopher Lee's little speech about animals, 1 for Britt Eckland's dirty dancing and the nice song, which I like (that sequence wasn't half as daft in 2006 as I expected it to be), ermmm... 1 for Christopher Lee himself, who does pull his bit off wonderfully, and 1 for...... well, cough, I suppose a conglomerate of May Morrison, the Harbour Master and the daft gravedigger, actually no, he was behaving like he was in a \"Wicker Man\" parody, er... say the schoolteacher...There. 5.

The atmosphere is timeless, the story compelling, and the music joins everything into a seamless whole. There is no single classification for Wicker Man; it's a murder mystery, a thriller, a musical, and a kind of \"what-might-have-been\". The result is shocking, sad, and even wistful. To tag it purely as \"Horror\" is nothing less than an insult.The story begins with a policeman getting a letter, in which he is asked for his help in finding a little girl. The village she vanished from is located on a remote Scottish island.When the policeman arrives, he is greeted with indifference, suspicion, and outright hostility. His reaction to the practices and faith of the villagers is nothing short of indignant rage and puritanical snobbery. The two forces at play drive the story along in unexpected directions, well-spiced with traditional songs which further illuminate the tale.It must be said that Christopher Lee's performance as Lord Summerisle is nothing short of brilliant. He did not steal the film, but he made it much more believable. With all the glory heaped upon this film, it remains one of those which has no middle ground; either you will love it, or you will hate it. The only thing the factions DO agree on is that the re-make with Cage was a festering pustule and never should have been allowed to exist, much less sully the reputation of this gem of cinema.You owe it to yourself to see this film at least once, especially with a Pagan friend.

For instance, the village conspiracy (compare Shirley Jackson's \"The Lottery\"); finding the book in the library that explains everything; or the shaky old plot gimmick of tricking the hero then claiming he \"came of his own accord\" to be sacrificed (no, he didn't; coming of your own accord is turning up and saying, \"Hey, sacrifice me\"). Anyway, how do they *know* he's a virgin, apart from his being religious and not wanting to be seduced by a crazy wall-slapping barmaid.And there's the dreadful music: men in bars striking up choreographed songs, and the naff hippie adaptations of trad folk tunes. Is that ludicrous wall-thumping scene supposed to be erotic?Biggest problem of all: the main character behaves unbelievably at every turn. The script requires that he be sacrificed, so he has to act stupidly: again, all the old movie cliches crop up, such as telling the villain what his plans are, investigating alone, the one-size-fits-all clothes change, the sabotaged aeroplane, etc.An earlier reviewer is nearest to the mark in suggesting it's some sort of horror farce. \"The Wicker Man\" is very hard to take seriously, and I think it only keeps its reputation as a classic movie through the relentless hype by its originators, such as Christopher Lee, who keep assuring us how good it is.3/10",

After watching 'The Wicker Man', I felt that it has certainly exceeded my expectations.I think that this has been said before in other reviews, but I found the film to be very believable. The way in which the Summerisle Community starts off to appear so innocently and then seeing it at the end in such a barbaric way really creates a chilling contrast.

I believe that if the film had been about any other religious it would not have been allowed to be made. Film writers take a loving pagan religion, and gives it a nasty face to show the world. Judging and giving the wrong view of different religions, to different people is were you get trouble from. This film is very hurtful to true pagans who are good people and do not believe any god would ask for any type of sacrifices. The film did not even perceive these people on this island to be not true pagans with there own agenda.",

I sneaked in with a friend up the emergency exit of the local Odeon in Swindon and sat through the film wide eyed, the highlight being of course (being a hormonal lad) seeing the beautiful Britt Eklands knockers as she danced about.The film left a lasting impression on me and I had never forgotten it (or Britts tits).Then last month I saw that the movie had been brought out on DVD, together with the Directors cut. I purchased it straight away and watched the longer version that night. All the memories (or was it mamories) came flooding back and I watched entranced as the film unfolded. And what a great movie it is to!I won't go into details about the plot as it's been well documented here, but just to say my wife, who had never seen the film before, just couldn't believe the ending! She loved it.Christopher Lee, Edward Woodward, Britt Ekland and all the locals who took part acted their socks off and deserve the praise that has been heaped upon them.Small Spoilers-------- Personally I prefer the directors cut of the film. In this version it is easier to understand Edward Woodwards character, and where he is coming from and why he turned down the lovely Britt when she sang out to him to come to her. (I would have been there in a flash with her first call!) The film also has about a dozen songs in it, but don't let that put you off. They add a certain feel to the film that makes it even better. End Spoilers---------If you want to see a great atmospheric movie, with a fantastic story about kidnap, murder, the occult and a musical to boot, then this is the film to get your hands on!Don't miss it. 10/10",

It's one of the very few works of cinema-history that transforms into anything you want it to be: may it be horror, may it be thriller, may it be satire. For me it's a black-comedy-folk-musical and as black comedy goes it's up there with the best. It's is as dark and horrific as Kubrick's \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"The Wicker Man\"'s final scene even rivals the famous bomb-ride of Slim Pickens in Kubrick's masterpiece. The horror doesn't rely on pointed teeth or spilled guts but some very basic revelations about human nature. Religion is forced onto you by birth, place and upbringing. Here the christian stands alone against a community of pagans and everything he represents suddenly seems to be just as (or even more) bizarre, elaborated and downright silly than the heathen rituals he encounters. As for the musical part it's just done with a natural grace. Actually this is one of the very few musicals where the scenes of singing and dancing are motivated (by the villager's lifestyle) and thus becoming organic. When the townpeople get into their nicely choreographed sequence about the lovely inn-keeper's daughter you will be reminded of Dennis Potter's musical fantasies. And in terms of comedy think Monty Pythons (the animal heads that quickly duck behind the pier when Sergeant Howie can't start his plane) or contemporary british comedy troupe \"The League of Gentleman\" (\"This is a local shop for local people!\") who borrowed heavily from this films style and setting. Be open minded about this flick and it will  blow you away. Watch it today because tomorrow it could be too late.",

I would love to read the novel, but haven't been able to find it. This movie is completely filled with pagan rituals and a lot of sexual innuendo, which it makes this movie all the better. I have to tell ya, Britt Ekland has a wonderful 'siren song', or nude dance, and it was very stimulating, even though a body double was placed during the full body shots. I wonderwhy, Britt was gorgeous!  The movie has a wonderful cast, and contrary to what everyone says, I loved all of the music, including the ancient chanting, which was great. This came out the same year as 'The Exorcist' and wow! I was born in 1973 and I feel a certain connection to both of these films, sounds funny, huh? If anyone wishes to buy 'The Wicker Man', get the Wooden Box version, it contains both the theatrical and extended versions, which the latter is much morecomplete and more provocative, which helps the film.

However, I did enjoy this film apart from these serious detriments and I'll watch Christopher Lee in anything. (I prefer him in stuff like 'The Devil Rides Out,' where he's very elegant .) Some joker had ruined the ending of this movie for me, but I still didn't know exactly how it was coming, or why. It's a strange, subversive film that seems very much a product of its time, what with the hippie values and all. There's been talk of remaking it, but I imagine they'd have to jettison the songs and some of the Woodstock-era sensibilities. Who could play the religious, stiff-necked Sergeant? Would a character that old-fashioned and devout even work today? Perhaps Mel Gibson or Jim Caviezel would fit the bill, but I can't see them agreeing to it!

Then the remake with Nicolas Cage, with the excerpts and criticisms made me glad I didn't waste my time with it. But seeing a review of Imprint's (Australia) latest in depth box set release of this original really intrigued me to get it. And glad to have it and finally see it! Starting off slow and somewhat quirky, as a police officer arrives at this remote island village over the disappearance of a child that the locals have no recollection of. The mother runs a sweet shop, and has a daughter there safe and sound still. So was this a hoax by someone in the village? As the officer checks out the town, he notices the populace has strange quirks, and odd leads that make the missing girl to be factual - but of no concern for the officer. As the officer gets to the bottom of this missing girl he learns the the villagers are indeed hiding secrets about her. But are content her disappearance and subsequent death was all for a good cause within their religion. Mortified, the officer plans to head back to mainland and launch a full investigation - but lo and behold, his plane no longer works! What he experiences next is beyond any ethic or moral he's ever known! I regret calling it a 'musical', but there are a few numbers in it that are relevant to the plot somewhat - but to me over emphasized. As to the mythological aspects, I think is very realistic. As we still don't know and/or understand so much of ancient religious practices. Be it the Druids, Aztec's, Mongolians, etc. And as we've recently seen, many cults have flourished based on loose interpretations of the bible, satanic religion, or just outright fantasy sold as fact. And I think that's the scariest part of the movie in that it neither condones nor condemns the villagers nor the officer for their beliefs. I have yet to see the remake, but I'm glad to have seen this first finally. One of those that will haunt for a long time on the mind.",

It is such a classic film, and it is especially well-known for its ending, which I will not mention, because it's a great ending that you will not expect to the movie.Everybody does a great job in the film. Edward Woodward is great as Sergeant Howie, and the people of Summerisle all play their parts, from the main parts of Summerisle to the people that you see for just a few seconds. However, if anyone, it is Christopher Lee that steals the show. He is, above anything else, a wonderful actor, and has been for just as long as most people can remember. He seems to know a lot about his characters, and this is no exception. Despite the limited amount of screen time that he gets, he is flat out phenomenal.Another thing that I must point out is the music. A couple of the songs in this movie may seem sweet, but don't be fooled: there is definitely a creepy tone to each and every one of the songs.All in all, a great movie.

But it deserves to be seen because it proves that all you really need to scare people is a good story. This film has a terrific atmosphere. The island of Pagans that Howie lands on is filled with beautiful scenery which makes you wish you lived there. It's a stunning landscape. The film has colorful locals and really goes in depth depicting ritualistic Pagan practices, something many people are fascinated with. The people on the island worship the old gods and Howie is nonetheless shocked to discover their open sex lives and that the women seem to wander around naked all the time. The film is seen through Howie's eyes as he investigates the disappearance of Rowan Morrison. The real stars here, however, are the islanders, since Howie is somewhat boring. Howie is strictly Christian and therefore anything involving the worship of nature and Paganistic practices is considered evil. I found myself turning against him for being so narrow minded. Sure, he's a Christian, but that is what the islanders believe in. When the end finally comes and Howie discovers the role he has to play in the whole scheme, it can be viewed as somewhat horrific (that fate sure would suck) but then again, I never really saw the islanders as bad people. I myself detest Christianity (don't shoot me) and even though it was painful to watch Howie's fate, I realized that Howie believes in sex after marriage and Sunday mass, etc. while the islanders believe in sacrificing to the gods. Does that make them bad? All in all, it's a very touchy subject that makes for a wonderful film that scares without conventional tactics. It was made in the '70s, but trust me, it deserves a shot.",

The film's ending is deservedly the number one cause for favourable comment, with the scene of nude Britt Ekland singing and dancing in her bedroom the next, but there's plenty of other aspects about the film that just makes it better with every viewing, not least of them being the settings, the costumes and the cinematography.  The island that the police sergeant flies out to seems not to have caught up with the 20th century - no sign of cars, telephones, televisions... an explanation perhaps for its clinging to Celtic paganism.  Admittedly there are problems with the script if you think about them - for example, how do the islanders even know about this low ranking policeman to send him an invitation in the first place?

The pleasure-loving pagan faith portrayed here has a dark, vile underside which was always there, ready to rise and show its destructive self.One of my favorite contrasts is the joyous, seemingly life-affirming Maypole-dance scene as opposed to Howie's visit to the ruined church. In the latter, everything about the scene (which includes the haunting music) is wistful and melancholic- Howie picks-up a piece of the now decayed wooden screen and then let's it gently fall back. He approaches the desecrated altar and makes a cross of wood which he leaves on top of it. There is a sense of sorrow and loss as he turns and slowly departs- Christianity is dead here.10 out of 10.",

It was originally placed in a double bill with \"Don't look Now\" and within a year it had vanished from the cinema screens in the U.K. Cut to pieces by the distributer and over shadowed by \"The Exorcist\" on it's original release, it is only now that it is finally getting the reconigition it has always deserved.",

I get the feeling that these people think that the behavior of the people of Summerisle is ultimately justified. So Christianity imposed itself on pagans a thousand years ago, GET OVER IT!! In my opinion, if a place like Summerisle ever did exist, a mass B52 napalm attack on the island and all its residence would be in order.ON WITH MY REVIEW.I rented this movie in 1984 and the effect it had on me after watching it lasted for two days. This film really toyed with my emotions. I guess its the way the film dragged me from disliking the character of Sgt. Howie and feeling the peaceful people of Summerisle as being a bit \"picked on\", to ultimately feeling pity for Howie and utter contempt for the islanders. This is one of the brilliant things about this film. Its ability to transform your feelings towards the characters is subtle but still noticeable. If you start watching this movie you will get hooked and drawn in but may wish you had not been. And as the film begins its dash towards its climax, we realize along with Sgt. Howie, that he has made a horrible mistake in coming to Summerisle. This has one of the most jaw dropping and disturbing endings in movie history. Similar in affect that the climax of LOOKING FOR MR GOODBAR had on unsuspecting audiences. Before there was the USUAL SUSPECTS, before there was THE SIXTH SENSE, there was THE WICKER MAN. A VERY VERY WELL DONE FILM!",

            "content": "Seen by some as the last great British horror (maybe even the last great British film), the Wicker Man stands towering above the periods more camp attempts at the macabre.The film kicks off with straight laced copper, Edward Woodward, speeding towards Summerisle in his nifty little sea plane. He is a man on a mission. And this particular mission involves finding a missing girl.\nFinding the locals particularly unhelpful (especially the girls mother) Woodward decides to stay the night on the island, in the local pub. And that's when things get weird. Woodwards character, an utterly devout christian, is somewhat perturbed by people having sex in graveyards, naked girls jumping through fire and children being force fed frogs. His faith is tested the most, though, by having Britt Ekland do a nude jig for him. These tests of faith help to set up a thrilling climax.The Wicker Man is superbly shot, the scenery is lovely and everything is well framed. The notion of this film being a musical never quite escapes you, due to the villagers bursting into song every 5 minutes, but adds to the quirkiness of the village.As most of you will probably watch this on DVD I might as well give a brief over view on that. The 2 disc pack comes with the print of the film most people will have seen and a second disc with an extended directors cut. The vanilla version has been cleaned up and looks very good. Lovely 5.1 surround and a great documentary which explains the how the film was badly treated by the studio and why it became such a cult hit. The second disc is where the action is at though. A \u0091directors cut'. Although whether it is a true \u0091directors cut' or not is debatable. The extra material fleshes out the story significantly, extending woodwards stay on the island by a day and explaining why he's there and expands Christopher Lees role significantly. The new material is sometimes of dubious quality (having been buried under a road for some years!) and the sound is nothing to write home about, but it is as close as you can possibly get to the director's vision.",

As a convinced atheist, I see it as the struggle between two equally deluded world-views, and it is particularly interesting to see how the policeman calls the islanders crazy for believing some supernatural creatures will save their crops when he calls for eternal life right before burning alive.

He almost reminded me some ultra conservative Tea party members, claiming that we are living in Christian country etc. That made me think it was all a joke. Basically it would be a good comedy if they wouldn't burn him in a wicker man. The last part, with the tragic death of Sergeant Howie, turned it from a good comedy into a ... not really scary horror movie, making me thinking \"What a paranoid Christian had written the plot?\" The last episode promotes the idea that we are living in a Christian country and all good people believe in Jesus and those that do not are wicked pagans that are doing human sacrifice on regular basic. Although the Sergeant Howie was really irritating, that I was almost happy to see him been burned in the wicker man. LOL",

I absolutely love this film. A very unique kind of movie of any era and most certainly a very different kind of Hammer Film ever made that I highly recommend watching.A Scottish police officer, Sgt. Howie, played by Edward Woodward, is not just a police officer he is also a pious Christian who travels by plane to a remote island off the Scottish coast to investigate complaints of a missing child. Once on the island, Howie is disgusted and shocked by the hitherto unknown pagan culture of the island's citizens. The islanders have forsaken Christendom only to re-embrace the old Celtic religion of centuries before and they are led by Lord Summerisle, played by the incomparable Christopher Lee. Without spoiling the plot I will say the islanders have all colluded to draw an unsuspecting victim to the island to play a part in their rituals which they hope will make them bountiful. It is hard to explain the film without spoiling the plot and the ending is a shock which I don't want to dilute for those who haven't seen the film.Both Lee and Woodward command their parts so adroitly that you are engrossed in what they say or do next. There is fascinating tension between Summerisle and Howie and how they view the world around them through their religious views. When the two are engaged against one another you simply can't look away.This is a horror film unlike others because there is no blood, no \"monster\". It's an intelligent film about human tension with a horrifying ending. A must watch.",

Recently, I watched it for perhaps the 6tth or 7th time. All previous attempts have been ended by distraction at various stages of the film. But this time I was able to view it throughout without interruption. So, considering this film's reputation, and after at last giving it my fullest attention, I find that it is not a horror film of the classic genre, and neither is it a real thriller because its pace is so laid back. In fact, in previous partial viewings I've often thought Sergeant Howie should just push off back to the mainland like he is constantly being advised to, and let the Summer-islanders get on with their lives. And I've wondered if it is because I'm not a hard and fast religious person? To me it is no shock at all that the islanders are pagans. If it suits them, then go for it. Not so, Sergeant Howie. All this may make people think (from this review) that there is nothing in the film of worth to titillate or entertain. And that would be completely the wrong conclusion.Don't look for shock value in The Wicker Man. It is a beautifully crafted and complete film that, despite the obvious lack of budget, manages to convey the way of a tight island community. Outsiders are not altogether welcome until, ironically they are, called in by the islanders on a special premise unbeknown to the outsider. And a Christian police officer is the perfect guinea pig. There is plenty of community wit, humour and a prominent celebration of the sexual act. Remember, this is paganism and unlike strict Christian belief, sex is one of the joyous fruits of nature. And it is this celebration of life (and death) that comes through most of the film, to Howie's disgust and later temptation. And it is only in the last 5 minutes or so that the full reason for Howie's presence on Summerisle is revealed to him. And by that time, your sympathies may even have sided with the islanders, despite the dark deed they are about to perform.",

I think it's a great story, the execution of which may falter in spots (particularly in the wardrobe department), but not so as to detract from the overall effect.  [WARNING:  POSSIBLE SPOILER]  Viewers who find \"holes\" in the plot frankly do not understand what is happening to Sgt. Howie and what the islanders are doing.  The Sgt. is extremely important to the islanders and they can devote all their energy and guile towards seeing him carry out Lord Summerisle's design.  They have nothing better to do; perhaps nothing else to do.  The Sgt., for his part, has been invited to Summerisle, and believes it's his part to solve a mystery presented to him.  There's no way he can get \"search warrants\" before May Day, and the islanders are offering more and more evidence of complicity in a shocking crime he must prevent, if possible.  So the Sgt.'s professional improprieties must be weighed against the need for him to act fast, as well as alone.    Everything that seems ironic or too coincidental for belief (another criticism of the film) is explained by the fact that the islanders have a plan for Sgt. Howie.  He needs to be led - pulled along by the nose - to a specific conclusion in a short time.  In sum, the plot makes perfect sense and proceeds in a deliberate way to its horrifying conclusion.  Lord Summerisle is a swine, of course, and manipulates everyone to save his own skin.  It can't happen here?  Maybe not.  The pagan elements are particularized so that the film shouldn't offend \"pagans\" in general; the Summerisle theology is a patchwork of ideas culled from thousands of years of non-Christian history, presumably to include those notions most profitable to Lord Summerisle and the locality.  We don't know how the islanders behave when Sgt. Howie isn't around.  Perhaps everything - family names & relationships on Summerisle, for instance - are put-on for his benefit (certainly the film involves enough paranoia to suggest such a fact).  Who could believe that Britt Ekland is really the landlord's daughter, after seeing the two of them together?  The social structure of the island may have been cobbled together in a few hours by a drunken Lord Summerisle and his lovely schoolteacher/friend, and put in place just in time for the Sgt.'s arrival.  What makes the film so much fun is that we learn the Sgt.'s fate before he does, without learning exactly how the story will be resolved.  So there's a conspiracy - what's the point of the conspiracy?  The answer we learn in the final fifteen minutes, which are utterly perfect!",

Warning: spoiler ahead!At the end of the movie, the islanders are standing around the burning Wicker Man, with the unfortunate mainlander screaming inside - and they start singing \"Sumer is i-cumen in\"!  I was so moved by this I started singing along, softly, to myself. Jose, sitting next to me, realized that I apparently knew the song - which he'd never heard or heard of before.

There are many other elements to enjoy along the way - eroticism, comedy and even a sing-a-long with Christopher Lee! The film keeps you off balance throughout - constantly setting up the central character, Edward Woodward's puritanical Sgt Howie, as a figure of ridicule and letting the audience root for Lee's liberal Lord Summerisle and his followers instead. The Wicker Man certainly makes a lie of the theory that only virgins survive in horror films! There is no heroic rescue to save Howie in the end because this is so far removed from your typical Hollywood popcorn movie.This would not be the same film if it were not for the shoestring budget, patchy picture quality and folksy ballads. The soundtrack, by the way, is every bit as quirky yet ethereal as the film and is well worth owning.

The folk music and the complete absence of blood in what is usually described as an horror will put off a lot of people and the slowness of pace will deter others. But this is an outstanding film.Ostensibly about a missing person investigation, the main theme of the film is in the clash between Christianity and Paganism and their underlying ideas and beliefs. Not the dogma, rites and tradition of Catholicism more often featured in films but hard-headed evangelical Scottish Presbyterian Christianity - no work (and precious little pleasure) on Sunday, no taking the Lord's name in vain, no sex outside marriage and the Bible as the Word of God. The Paganism is well developed too, not just dancing naked round bonfires on Hallowe'en, but fertility rituals, festivals, ceremonies and sacrifice to numerous gods. Lord Summerisle who owns the island is candid that it was his grandfather who introduced Paganism for pragmatic reasons, but this is no made-up religion; instead a return to the old gods of the sun, the sea, fertility and the harvest.To my sometime Christian eyes, the Christianity of the police sergeant is captured perfectly and Pagan islanders seem sinister. Speaking with pagan friends, they welcome the portrayal of the islanders and regard the sergeant with suspicion or as a bigot. So then, is this film some sort of religious drama? No, it is an horror film. Horror can be more than shock or blood.One important point: If you have not seen this film and you get the choice of which version to see, choose the original (short) release. Much has been written about the various versions - the 'Director's Cut' is widely praised and it is interesting to see some deleted scenes - but one thing which seems to have been overlooked by almost all reviewers is that the original cinema release is a masterful piece of editing with a more logical flow, greater subtlety and an outstanding opening sequence. It also has far better picture quality. You can always watch the 'Director's Cut' if you want to see the film again.",

But anyways, quite a bit of the lost footage to the film is never to be found and rumoured to be landfill in the M4 motorway in England (maybe I'm wrong! England does have the full length version!) But here in America we are blessed with a video release of the infamous 102 min. version. So with that out of the way, \"The Wicker Man\" is a great imaginative, original sleeper, that should have been better received. But it wasn't, and thus is the reason it's considered a cult classic. In a way, \"The Wicker Man\" is like some adult Grimm's fairy tale, that has anything but a rosey conclusion. The story concerns that of Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward giving a rather convincing performance as one of the history's most self righteous annoying police officers) who is lured down to an island called Summerisle (but having been filmed in Scotland) because of a letter concerning a missing girl. Once on the island, Sergeant Howie begins interrogating the islanders in a rather abrasive manner sprinkling his dialog with words like \"heathens\" or \"pagens\", and declaring \"let me remind you, that you are still under England's rule and the church of England\" (I'm paraphrasing of course). He's basically acting very foolish for a man on his own, on an island he knows nothing about. But this is what makes the film kind of interesting...the protagonist is the most unsympathetic and annoying leads you're ever likely to witness. But as the story of the island continues to unravel, you do realise that he's right about the pagen thing. What I thought was so cool about the island, was that it reminded me of some kind of secret society that Mr. Steed and Emma Peel would be battling in the British TV show \"The Avengers\". Or maybe the kind of island Number Six from the TV show \"The Prisoner\" would try to escape from. Personally, I'm not sure I could leave an island inhabited by naked women who resembled Britt Ekland and Ingrid Pitt, but there is something menacing about pagen beliefs that Sergeant Howie will discover. What's really fascinating is the anti-religion themes (any religion for that matter) that dominate the script. Seargent Howie's over the top religous beliefs, that he uses as a means to judge, and never as a means to understand. And of course the islands over the top religous beliefs lead to human sacrafice for the good of the crops. It seems that neither beliefs are healthy in a society. But it seems to me that one human sacrifice for the good of all society is a fair trade, considering the deaths that probably happen from farm machinery alone. But in either case, the film leaves it up to the viewer to decide what is morally correct. Personally, I quite dug Paul Giovanni's score. It reminded me of some Fairport Convention or Traffic \"John Barleycorn Must Die\" song. It's folky \"laid back\" pagen music to groove by. Any movie about pagens with Britt Ekland, Ingrid Pitt (who cares if her accent isn't English, she's beautiful!!), Christopher Lee, and Edward Woodward (his parents must of been takin' the p**s on that name?) can't be all bad. I highly recommend this film to open minded people, who like great English cult films that Hammer Studios use to spit out. Not really scary, kind of weird funny. 10 out of 10!!!",

It has been called the Citizen Kane of horror. It has been called Sci-Fi. It is neither.It is simply the story of a righteous man who is put to the test of his own faith.

            "content": "Is it a cult classic? Or is it a classic film about a cult? The truth is that this film is the definition of a British cult classic. Recognition of just how good a film it is was a long time coming but it is now rightly recognised as one of the greatest cult horror films of all time. The plot centres around Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) who is sent to a remote Scottish island governed by Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee) to investigate the disappearance of a missing child. The plot itself sounds simple but in truth the film is a psychedelic erotic trip out from start to finish which is a really overwhelming cinema experience.The film contains stand out performances from both Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee which adds so much depth to the film. Christopher Lee's portrayal of an apparently civilized man being the instigator of these pagan rituals is truly chilling, and equally powerful is Edwar Woowar's reaction to this in playing a Christian upholder of justice. The film is filled with scenes of eroticism and impromptu musical numbers which really should not work, but strangely enough they do. People appearing in strange animal masks should not be terrifying, it should be funny, but it isn't. The film itself is filled with contradictions of the horror genre and is itself a flawed film (hence why I have not given it 100%), but despite this it is still probably the most chilling film of all time and I love it. I love just how flawed it actually is and the fact that it still works.If you have seen this film you will know that this is embodied in the encounter with 'The Wicker Man'; a fun filled occasion of music, dancing and sacrifice. All that is left to say is that this is a must watch film and one of my favourite horrors of all time. At the end on the film it gives you a feeling like no other film could...just pleased don't watch the remake by accident.",

            "content": "One of the greatest films ever made, and a film that I have seen so many times it amazes me that I don't get bored. You've read loads of reviews already so I'll cut straight to the points others don't usually mention. This is the epic historical battle between Christianity and paganism that has raged for two thousand years, perfectly encapsulated in a two hour movie. The earthy, naturalistic, sexual, hedonistic, amoral, lustful, jocular, deceitful and violent natures of the pagan islanders versus the serious, chaste, courageous, moralistic, steadfast, naive and self-righteous qualities of the Christian Sgt. Howie. The viewer is torn between the two forces throughout till the bitter end. The clash of morals is epitomized in the character of Willow, the landlord's daughter. To the Christian she is a slut and a sly temptress. To the islanders she is as lovely as a spring flower, graciously releasing the young boys of the village from their virginity. It's hilarious how her own father taps out the rhythms on his liquor bottles to the pub singalongs celebrating her carnal virtues. In the school the girls shout out an answer \"Phallic Symbol!!\" with glee as the teacher unashamedly lectures about the role of the penis in their culture, while the boys dance round the maypole singing a song we certainly didn't sing in my village.The folk-rock soundtrack is exceptional and performed by a band put together just for this movie. Try to find anything else by Paul Giovanni or the group Magnet. There's nothing out there. Every song sounds so pure and angelic (except the bawdy \"landlord's daughter\") but when you listen to the lyrics they are often explicitly sexual. A truly great film. However, three little points always annoyed me.1) If the island suffered a bad harvest, would they really bother taking a harvest photo of the May Queen with a few crappy vegetables strewn about? This is so obviously in there to help the plot along.2) The explanation given by Lord SummerIsle of how his grandfather bought the island and re-introduced paganism out of a personal whim and that the islanders took it on because of the success of his new fruit strains. For me it would have been more realistic to say he found the islanders already practicing paganism underground and he banished the Christian clergy for good allowing the old religion to flourish.3) The glee with which all the islanders, bar none, join in the last act. Surely at least one person would have piped up and said \"This is a bit wrong, isn't it?\"",

One would ask why choose this as the central theme? And the response given by the film is that this conflict can serve as a blueprint to change (or resistance thereof). Mind you this movie was filmed in the middle of social and cultural change in England.Musically there was a rejection of the Beatles, culturally there was rejection to established norms regarding the Crown and other traditional practices, and socially there was more acceptance to the diversity of people, all which came under attack by traditional values.This film ultimately does a great job at displaying the essence of the decade it was created during, but squanders any chance at achieving greatness by succumbing to a drawn out and ultimately uninspiring ending.",

            "content": "This movie sure gives a whole new meaning to the phrase \"burning pig.\"Now that we have tasteless \"jokes\" out of the way let's unwrap this literal Celtic straw man.The most powerful part for me was the end with the cop (Edward Woodward) praying to his Christian God while the people outside were praying to their Celtic Neopagan gods and the flick ending with a close-up on the sun that, if anthropomorphized, would probably say \"these primates must be crazy.\" The amount of sheer loneliness and helplessness the cop must have felt during his last minutes on Earth had to be beyond excruciating.God, those over-abundant sing-along muscial-y interludes were more dreadful than the whole \"human sacrifice\" shebang though. Sure, it gave the movie a \"creepy\" feeling and culminated wonderfully in the last scene of the movie but other than that it was pure torture. Just watching the movie should be enough to bring harvest to at least a thousand Neopagan island societies.Now there is not much to say about the rest of the movie which felt like a regular episode out of a generic contemporary Bri'ish TV cop drama. It all started with \"harmless\" police-obstructing activities of fun pranks and pub jokes and feigning ignorance with good-spirited quasi-hippie songs slipped here and there and eventually getting to the surreal David Lynchian tipping point and afterwards it was clowning around in jester costumes and then some. Suffice to say this stubborn cop wasn't exactly an exemplary Sherlock Holmes but your typical uptight stubborn fascist bureaucrat in a state security suit who no wonder ended up trapped on the island. Now now, I realize that the movie wasn't ever supposed to be about a cunning detective cracking bizarre homicide cold case and have \"boys down the station\" giving them a congratulatory pat on the back and being ordered a knight/dame by the Queen herself afterwards but more about one of Queen Elizabeth's Finest thinking he can arrest the entire \"heathen\" island alone while not seeing the obvious that's in front of him but nevertheless, color me curious, what would S.H. do? I am sure he would successfully turn the gullible villages against Summerisle himself since Watson would meanwhile fetch all the evidence villagers needed to see to be convinced (the poor copper didn't have anything on him except his fool(ish) costume) and wrapping it up perfectly by appearing at the Summerisle estate with Summerisle completely flabbergasted, the old dog. And instead of a borderline cynical close-up shot of the careless sun we would have a tender intimate close-up of Watson acting all incredulous \"b-but how did you know that Rowan was on it all along?\" with Holmes confidently responding \"The E-word, my dear Watson.\"Now, the overall theme is kinda dated and fits shlocky B-flicks that are based on the \"us modern civilized upright Christian citizens\" vs. \"creepy weird tribes and hidden retrograde cults\" trope and the entertainment and cheap shock derived from this clash of values. This type of \"spooky children-of-the-corn cult thriller\" genre, and particularly this movie, can be interpreted multiple ways: \n* We can see it as a silly oversimplification of polytheist/nature worship religions, plus putting a \"spooky\" spin to it -- and considering from the historical standpoint that the 1970s WAS basically the golden age of cults we could take it as a jab at these cults but with an awkward blend of basic imagery from these innocuous nature religions, showing them in a negative light by association. \n* Another could be taken as good ol' Christian-leaning British conseravative pandering (\"See how barbarous are these creepy pagans? You ought to be glad to be in good company of Jesus Christ & friends & The Queen, innit\").\n* Another as an English director painting fictitious Scottish villagers the same way some Yankee director from New York comes to shoot a spooky thriller in the south where they show Southern fellows engaged in simplistic gun-totin' Bible-thumpin' moonshine-brewin' endeavors. \n* Another as an egalitarian poke at all religions because it doesn't matter how innocent or \"righteous\" it is, at the end of the day when the sun goes down you are still going to look foolish (like a jester; that was a good one, Robin Hardy) when you think a \"prayer\" or a \"human sacrifice\" will grant you a bountiful harvest - but, God forbid, if you don't try, right?Now, The Wicker Man is a smorgasbord of all the above; it could work well as a religious satire (and it does) as well as a \"spooky thriller\" and also a dated critique of cults in general. Whatever the case, it was a fun movie. Chilly setting, sly villain, dense cop, 70s hairy humans, what else to wish for? Well, actually nothing, I don't wish to watch this movie again.* * * \"And on that bed there was a girl\nAnd on that girl there was a man\nAnd from that man there was a seed\nAnd from that seed there was a boy\nAnd from that boy there was a man\nAnd for that man there was a grave\nFrom that grave there grew ... \na tree\"",

The story suddenly becomes crystal clear.Instead of letting the viewer languish in all the chaos, it suddenly picks up, and the viewer is suddenly working out all the answers, right along with Sergeant Howie. It is compelling stuff at this stage, but it still never ceases to be bizarre.Despite a not altogether too surprising twist near the end, the visions of 'horror within society' really are the stuff of nightmares. This is especially true when the deceptively normal looking inhabitants of the island are all completely absorbed in the ritualistic singing, during the somewhat disturbing ending.It would also have been nice to have a few text sentences after the credits, along the lines of 'That year, the crops were successful.

This is not the only reason to see the movie, though its a pretty strong reason if you're the type who appreciates either form of gender doing unexpected things to the soundtrack of some very lively folk music.Another good reason to see this film is if you like to collect mental images of great hair styles in history. Christopher Lee's coif steals the show, hands down.Aside from the camp aspect, the story has a number of question marks in its plot. In other words, you can't understand why the main character, the investigating sargeant, gets so embroiled in a situation that could easily have been side-stepped with better protocol.That being said, if his protocol had been better we'd not have much of a story at all.Overall The Wicker Man is good for the musical score, film folly and novelty but it is poor as a contender for being called a \"good\" movie.",

            "content": "This film gets classified as horror, though it's actually a tense mystery. It's a textbook film in that the 'story' is a showcase for a chance to demonstrate the various forms of Paganism. It doesn't show a specific type, but rather shows a kind of mish-mash of different details of several Pagan religions, demonstrated in this film as one.The story involves a mysterious letter that claims that a girl has gone missing from a remote island community. A police sergeant (Edward Woodward) is sent to investigate. People alternately claim the girl doesn't exist, then that she is dead, but never really answering any questions. The mystery builds to the end, with it's shocking 'sacrifice'.This film was very controversial in it's day since the Pagans aren't shown openly eating babies and other ridiculous exaggerations; a common (and unfair) perception of the time, and sometimes now. They are shown as a normal people that laugh, sing, and even grieve (A quick, but touching shot of a nude woman crying over her husbands grave) as anyone else would. The ending doesn't help this perception, much, but there had to be a selling point or the movie would have never been made.Whether your interested in Celtic Studies, or like a suspense/mystery with good pacing (Try and get the 102 minute version, it seems to be the one that makes the most sense) then this film is for you.Steelblade",

However, what begins as a routine enquiry soon becomes a terrifying ordeal for the devout church-goer.What a wonderful piece of British eccentricity! From the outset as we see the seaplane carrying Sergeant Howie to the island of Summerisle, backed by wonderful views of the Scottish coast and hauntingly supported by Scottish folk music. Through the twists and turns of deceit and fully planned misguidance of the Summerisle residents. The beautiful landlords daughter (Britt Eckland) unsuccessfully attempting to seduce the devout Christian policeman. The powerful performance of Lord Summerisle, superbly portrayed by Christopher Lee. The strange May Day celebrations with all the residents sporting fear inducing masks and costumes. To the genuine, gut wrenching, horror of the closing sequence. Viewers are kept on the edge of their seat without realising what is really happening. Until the final true horror is revealed. This film is full of quirky remarks, haunting folk music, wonderfully evocative visions of a naked Britt Eckland. And finished with a moment of truly powerful horror when Sargeant Howie first sets eyes on the method of sacrifice.This is proof to me that for a movie to hold the true meaning of horror it doesn't need to fill the screen with a slashers blood-fest.

            "content": "I watched \"The Wicker Man\" (the original 1973 film) for the first time a few days ago. I admit, I disliked the movie quite a bit in the first half, trying to make sense of it all.However, the final 20 minutes or so are an awesome spectacle and the weirdness and the flaky hippie atmosphere of the whole thing built up quite nicely to the climax.SPOILER AND ANALYSIS: I was expecting this movie to be a \"pagans=good and misunderstood / Christians=bigoted and intolerant\" type of political screed. Instead, the film kind of takes more of the tack of \"a pox on all their houses\" when it comes to the subject of religion.There have been horror/exploitation movies made about the Inquisition, witch burnings, slavery in the Deep South and Nazi atrocities. I'd like to see one made about atrocities of the Soviet Union (specifically the forced famines of the 1930s).I got into a 'debate' with someone the other day about the root causes of war, and his response was a typical one: \"Religion is the cause of all suffering and misery in the world\". Well, they stripped out religion in the USSR (or at least they tried to) and that society was just as horrific (if not more) than Medieval Europe in terms of misery and death. I think that oppression by the use of religion is just a symptom of the darkness of human nature and it's inclination for social control over others.So I think the film is trying to say that whatever ideology or religion (whether it be Christianity in medieval Europe, forced atheism in the USSR or paganism in an isolated community) would be used by those in charge to maintain control at any cost, even resorting to \"state-sanctioned\" murder. SPOILER WARNING AGAIN: Wicker Man starts off showing many beautiful songs and dances of the old religion and then ends with a horrific human sacrifice--an ironic dichotomy of a Utopia devolving into the worst aspects of all the other idealistic societies.On the flip side, religion/ideology is a necessary evil that maintains social cohesion. Sure, we have pluralism and multiculturalism today, but there are \"anti-hate\" laws in place (state-sanctioned ideology) that force people to get along with each other, for good or bad. It remains to be seen if pluralism (the new religion?) will be able to survive economic collapse.",

As a Christian who has never seen this film before I found it a rather quaint and retarded exploration of spiritual forces, suggesting as it does, that there is a finality about the ritualistic sacrifice at the end. When of course the opposite is true. There is retribution. So, the film kind of leaves one laughing in the aisles somewhat. A wholly daft film that conveys only half the truth.",

I think the film represents a cultural stumbling block for much of the American audience. By & large, we're not likely to relate to the traditions of countryside pub life, English politeness or Celtic religion (even though elements of these customs have had their carryover here in different ways). Americans of Euro-decent who are interested in their lineage may find this fascinating. I would think the same could be said of those familiar with - perhaps through travel -and interested in the English culture. I wish I can say that the film would have a broader appeal based simply on its marvelous technique & style, but I'm afraid that the \"local flavor\" of Wicker Man is so thick that Americans would instantly see it as being too odd - or even \"silly\" as one person commented - to spend time on (to be sure, it does seem to have a small following here).

            "content": "***SPOILERS AHEAD!!!***\tIt's hard for me to say what I truly think of The Wicker Man. I've had the habit of deriding this film many times with friends on late-night movie binges. Sure, it's an easy enough film to laugh at; from the hilariously out-of-place folk music at the begging of the film, to the wanton Tits-and-Ass segments which sprinkle the mise en scene in a pathetically-transparent-yet-trademarkingly-70's attempt to keep our attention focused to the story, to the absurd nude dancing sequence in which a trope blonde shimmies against a bedroom wall, this movie has all the right ingredients for a cinematic train wreck. However, unlike countless other films which deserve their place in the annals of B-moviedom for whatever \"ironic\", \"cheesy\", or perhaps politically dated elements that can be found under the lens of couch-potato analysis, there exists some primal element about The Wicker Man which fascinates me, and subsequently begs me to come back for viewing after viewing. I remain baffled each and every time I finish watching this film, unable to put my finger on exactly what it is about this movie that makes it so compelling. Finally, I think that I have a vague idea as to why. \t \tFirst, there is the notion that this film evades any form of categorical summation. The Wicker Man is not a horror film - or if it is, it certainly isn't done in the traditional vain of the genre. The film's climax is certainly horror-like, it is the unveiling of an underling 'horror' that has been hidden all along. The film's ending aside, not a single person dies throughout the unfolding of the plot. The Wicker Man is also not a comedy, although the purposefully silly dialogue at times (\"NO, I DOES NOT REFRESH ME!!\") coupled with a hilarious classroom discussion of the use of phallic symbols in western culture is both smart and well-crafted satire. The Wicker Man is not a romance, although Sergeant Howie's subliminal want to disregard his religious faith and submit to his desires for Miss Rose becomes a pivotal element to the plot. The Wicker Man is not a musical, while the first bar room scene (\"The innkeeper's daughter?!\"), the aforementioned bedroom fantasy scene, and the May Day scenes would hint otherwise. In essence, The Wicker Man has all these things, but its totality is not an exemplification of any single part. It is the confluence and the concatenation of many individual themes and elements, making it a movie in a league of its own. \t \tThe Wicker Man is a story of what it means to lose one's identity. It is an extremely postmodern film in that: 1) as stated earlier, it evades a cinematic category, but is more a grouping of all those things, and 2) The film itself is a comment on how we as people are the collection of ideas and information that creates our cultures. The Wicker Man is the story of a man who is forced to question, and essentially abandon, both faith in culture and faith in a Christian God. Many would argue (yes, especially the post moderns) that they are one in the same. \t \tSergeant Howie arrives at the island looking for Rowan Morrison, a missing girl who he believes to have been murdered. Throughout his search, he is fooled, lied to, and manipulated by the townsfolk in an attempt to dissuade him from furthering the investigation. Howie is disgusted by the island's Pagan leanings, and uses his Christian faith as a means of looking down upon them and reassuring himself of his superiority, all while using his status as a policeman to intimidate them into submission. Howie believes that Morrison is dead at this point, yet he remains tenacious as his search progresses, looking for a body and a motive behind her murder. At this point, we notice that Howie begins to eulogize the missing girl. He makes a wooden cross out of sticks when looking for her body in the graveyard, he scolds the girl's mother and teacher for their lack of Christian teachings, and her carries her photograph in his breast pocket at all times. In essence, Rowan Morrison becomes an extension of the Virgin Mary. She has been transformed into the Christian model of femininity: Purity, chastity, and innocence. Rowan Morrison is now a legend, a myth, and a metaphor in Howe's mind.  He seeks to find her because it is his duty to defend the myth and the root of his beliefs. \t \tIn the end, Howie discovers that Morrison was alive the entire time. He attempts to rescue her, his Christian faith telling him that it is his duty to protect the chaste and pure. However, she deceives him and eventually leads him to a mob that seeks to sacrifice him for the crops of the island. He learns that Morrison was a rouse the entire time, and thus his idea of the chaste female, and all the Christian connotations that comes with it, was a product of his imagination. The legend he created and propagated was the result of an inherently corrupt belief system, and in the final moments of his life he sees that he lived a life searching for a truth that never existed. As Howie is captured by the villagers, he begins to pray, asking God to save him from the inevitable fate of being burned alive as sacrifice. As he is placed inside the Wicker Man, and as the flames begin to sear his flesh, he yells the words \"Oh God!\" It is at this moment that he stumbles upon his most feared revelation: In his darkest hour, after years of subservience and chastity, Howie knows that God would not hear his screams. This is the existential ends, the very Nausea that Jean Paul Sartre spoke of; to stumble upon the tragic realization that one lives in a world without God. In the final seconds of the film, the camera lifts up from the burning visage of The Wicker Man and we see a setting sun. Nature's own ubiquity prevails over the spiritual. The absolutes of a physical world will always triumph over the epochs of our fallible beliefs and the cultures they create.A terrible movie? No way. 8/10",

            "content": "Don't read past this first sentence if you haven't seen either version of Wicker Man (1973 and 2006).Having seen this version and the newer one, I must say that this version is atrocious. The only redeeming quality of this film is the burning of the \"Christian\" at the end.The audio was rough, at best; I've seen films from the 40s with better sound. The dialogue wasn't of consistent volume, I had to constantly adjust up and down to catch everything, and I still had to replay several portions to hear what was said. The musical breaks hurt the film far more than they helped. Maybe it had something to do with the social movement happening in the UK at the time, but the songs were too loud (comparatively), and seemed to only partially connect to the story.By the end, I was so annoyed by the investigator that I wanted to see him die, horribly. His acting was entirely unbelievable, as was his religious diatribe. When compared to the newer version, the best part about the ending was the victim's prayer for help, though it doesn't hit quite as hard as a man's daughter burning him to death (as in the 2006 version).In retrospect, I would have expected these two films to be juxtaposed, both in time and place of creation. America seems to be the current hot-bed of \"Christian\" propaganda, especially now, so it just makes sense that a contemporary film would retaliate with such anti-Christian sentiment. By comparison, I've not come across any zealots preaching Christian dogma in my times in the UK, though this film leads me to believe that it may have been worse at the time of production.",

            "review_title": "One of the all time great British horror films",
            "content": "I had seen The Wicker Man twice before. The first time I watched it, when I was about 16 or 17 (I'm 30 now) I just didn't get it, maybe this was because I was at an age when if a film had Christopher Lee in it and was on after midnight, I usually had a pre-conceived idea of what it would contain. I revisited a few years later and upon second viewing I did 'get it'. Watching it for the third time reiterated my opinion that it is one of the great British horror movies.The story centres around a police officer, Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) visiting a remote Scottish island, Summerisle, to investigate a report of a missing 12 year old girl. Upon arrival at the island, the islander's all deny any knowledge of the girl's existence, even the woman believed to be her mother. As Howie continues to investigate he begins to discover that all is not quite right on Summerisle, with the villagers seemingly practising their own religion, a lot of which entails highly sexual behaviour, which grates against Sergeant Howie's own strong Christian views. The islanders also seem to all be operating under the orders of the mysterious Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee). The town's disregard for Howie's authority and religious beliefs causes him to investigate further and when he discovers that the girl must be somewhere on the island, this starts a series of events that lead to a shocking climax.The reason the film works so well is because it eschews a lot of the horror conventions that were common in the era that it was made. Rather than using formulaic devices ('Don't open that door!' etc), the film uses it's location and cast of bizarre characters to create a sense of a creeping and gradual uneasiness. There aren't many moments that will cause you to jump out of your skin but the film contains surreal and disturbing imagery to create a sense of fear within the audience (another film that does this is The Shining). Another aspect of the film that sets it apart from it's peers is the soundtrack, which consists of traditional folk and pagan music that goes well with the films location and imagery, in fact, there are points in the film that almost feel like a musical, which lends itself well to the slightly surreal nature of the movie.What I like about the film is the fact that, as an audience, we are watching the film through the eyes of Sergeant Howie. He appears in every scene and we don't find out any information before he does, so his confusion and intrigue is matched by our own. Another aspect that helps the film work is the location. The fact that all the action takes place on a remote island adds to the fear. Howie arrives by plane, and when he tries to leave the plane has been sabotaged, therefore trapping him and the audience on the island. This is an incredibly effective device which adds to the fear the film contains. Another factor that helps the film is the islander's behaviour towards Howie, they never show any fear or appear to be intimidated by him and treat him with a casual indifference and amusement despite his authority, this gives him (and us) a feeling of powerlessness.I think that the film is about the dangers of organised religion and a clash of ideals and the devastation that these things can cause.It is a very well made film. The direction and cinematography are superb and Woodward and Lee both play their parts with convincing aptitude, the soundtrack is also brilliant too. It also features an incredible final shot too.An excellent and fascinating film 9/10 ...now what's this I hear about a remake?....",

            "content": "So the general plot is that The police man (Howie) gets an anon letter from an island that says someones daughter is missing. Then through trial and tribulations abound, it is revealed to be a great conspiracy committed by the island so as to make a better crop yield in the forthcoming year. Now when I stopped watching that was my general take away from the film; nothing more than basic standard horror fare really, clever plot, but other than that not much else is unique. BUT now that I have had time for the title to stew in my soul a little bit longer, I can't help but have a growing appreciation not only for the film as a standalone entity (the world/lore/etc is all ingeniously intricate and no corners were cut in regards to fleshing out this religion of the islanders). For me though, the greatest takeaway that I've really found is the revelation that Howie wasn't afraid. Not until it was far too late. He was so bull sure of his authority, of his churches authority, of his police badges authority, that he never questioned what would happen if everyone conspired to murder him. The idea of a murder conspiracy is spooky, but what's really horrifying is the fact that this man, who really could be any man, went to this island with certain preconceived notions in regards to the law of the land, and he managed to be completely wrong in every way, and he didn't even notice until he was being burned alive! It really begs the question of what kind of constants we as a race consider permanent and transcendent of culture, because you can swap out Howies beliefs for anyone's beliefs ( a la, your own) and possibly horrifyingly discover you too would be burned alive for stepping on the wrong toes. Tl;Dr: Good horror movie, but once you digest it you realize the true horror isn't so much the content of this film itself but rather the message it portrays",

TWM is an effective, creepy flick, regardless of whether the showcased pagan beliefs & customs are unsettling (and i think we're mostly meant to identify only remotely with Sgt. Howie's growing horror\u0097he really is a right prude and the flick was made in very libertine times; though, after all, immolation can really spoil one's afternoon). And to my way of thinking, Edward Woodward's francophonic pronunciation of \"turquoise\" is itself worth the price of admission. But the true, immutable, almost Lovecraftian horror of the movie is its music, from the \"Corn Rigs and Barley Rigs\" song over the credits to the truly loathsome balladization of the circle of life around the maypole to the pub music to which Britt Eckland ostensibly makes love to a wall. Awful, awful stuff, and all the worse for being so obviously new-writ for the movie, instead of sounding like (or actually being) traditional music, such as the residents of Summerisle would undoubtedly sing and play to accompany their millennia-old rites and ceremonies.",

However, after getting excited and actually watching this movie, I can honestly see why someone at least tried to remake it (though failed humorously at it). The Wicker Man is another one of those over-hyped and over-acclaimed films that generally fails to deliver upon its highly esteemed reputation. Don't get me wrong...this movie, by no means, is horrible....its just.....average. Let's break it down for a minute (no spoilers) :Ok. The acting is great; Edward Woodward does a phenomenal job as Sergeant Howie, the soundtrack is stellar and the premise is promising....but the actual execution is just....., frankly, weak. From the horribly placed and unintentionally comical musical numbers to the wacky pace and over-hyped so-called \"shocking\" ending, the Wicker Man simply fails to deliver that \"it\" factor to make it a true, brilliant classic. And don't get me wrong: The movie wasn't terrible...(frankly, I love the strong religious overtones, bizarre sexual emphasis and lack of violence) Overall, however, it was just half-way decent. P.S. I saw the \"shocking\" ending from a mile away on my first viewing....maybe in '74 that was shocking or something.....I don't know. It was the best part of the movie but it wasn't as shocking or creepy or disturbing as it's made out to be. Memorable, though.But see it for yourself if you don't take my word for it.-Tsuwamono",

            "content": "I will say, ahead of time, that I had this ending ruined for me before I saw the film, but I will try and remove that aspect of my experience from my review.Edward Woodward plays Howie, a police officer sent from the mainland of England to Lord Summerisle's (played by Christopher Lee) private island to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. As the film progresses, Woodward is progressively more and more baffled and horrified by the pagan religious practices of the residents of the island, ending in twist at the end I won't ruin, because I don't want to detract from the film's impact. It could be a product being raised in the 90s and 00's where everyone is so concerned with freedom of self expression and political correctness, but I find Woodwards character to be stuck up, needlessly hostile, xenophobic and generally unlikable. He is a devoted Christian man being thrust into a pagan world, and his indigence makes sense for the character, but I found the character the be largely unlikable. His character is contrasted by Christopher Lee, who plays Lord Sumerisle, is obviously hiding something concerning the disappearance of the young girl. He is kind, cordial, and very patient with Woodward's hostility. To me, this sets up a very interesting dichotomy. You have the main character, a man the audience relates to, because he is a lay man from a normal, religious world. But even though we relate to him he is unlikable. Then you have the character of Sumerisle, who lives a baffling life with an archaic religion. So he seems wrong, but is the obviously more personable character. By the end of the movie these lines are so blurred for me i don't know who i like and who i hate. And I LOVE it. By the end of the movie, both parties display religious zealotry that seem insane, given the circumstance.The use of music in this movie is incredibly odd at first, but believe me, if you go with it, it adds so much to the atmosphere you wont be able to think of a standard score being effective. At times the movie almost becomes a musical. In the end, i can't think of this as a horror movie, even though there were parts that horrified me. I consider this a fine thriller but not a good horror movie, which is an important distinction.Definite recommend for horror/thriller fans, but i don't think it's for everyone. 7/10",

            "content": "A devout Christian Police Sergeant ('Howie') is requested via a letter of source unknown, to search for a missing child on a remote Scottish Island called 'Summerisle' who has now been missing for several months. On the island he is stunned by the Heathen way of life, which incorporates free-sex, a bizarre method of teaching and ancient rituals. The people of Summerisle are lead by 'Lord Summerisle' (Christopher Lee,) whom 'Howie' believes is orchestrating a cover-up over the disappearance of 'Rowan Morrison,' as not even her own mother will acknowledge her existence. 'Howie' is to be sacrificed by the people of this island (who sabotage his plane) in order to convince nature to favour them. This film is riddled with excellent quotes and strange events. A horror film as they should be - on a psychological level rather than a knife wielding, white-masked, indestructible killer (you know who I'm talking about - John Carpenter!)Christopher Lee was not paid for this great film, until other stars do this they'll \"simply never understand the true nature of sacrifice.\"",

Has she already been sacrificed to the Wickerman? Or is she still alive being held captive to be sacrificed or is there something worse in store for Sgt Howie? While it does accurately portray some aspects of Neo paganism, it does go where real practitioners would never go. Having seen this at a time when I was deeply into Paganism, esp Celtic beliefs, I was not offended by it's approach to what paganism could be if left unchecked. It doesn't implicate modern pagans as a catch all tale it stands alone as a good tale with a great twist, and a fantastic soundtrack of wonderful songs. There are two versions available to the buyer and I'd get both as they each have a few scenes unique to the other. this is a gem of a film relegated to cult status (no pun intended, but the irony is there) and worth finding. It is dated but it can not be touched, it should never had been remade, it was perfect as is.",

            "review_title": "Only one criticism!!!!",
            "content": "Anthony Shaffer's \"The Wicker Man\" deserves to be called one of the best British horror films ever made. Shaffer's cleverly written script gives the film an element of dark comedy which become apparent the second time you watch it.In the first few minutes you are sucked in to the lies that the island's inhabitants are harbouring, lines such as \"A missing child is always trouble\" become ironic, as Sergeant Howie is about to realise just how much trouble.....Religion plays a large part in the film as Howie is a very strong Christian and he believes in pantheism, which evidently effects the way he reacts in the situation he is put in. The island's inhabitants are all Pagans and prefer to view Christianity as a \"comparative religion\". As part of Howie's beliefs as a Christian he doesn't believe in sex before marriage but cant bring himself to say the word sex, just as the school teacher cant bring herself to say the word death. She explains that they prefer to think of life as a \"regenerative\" force.The island's inhabitants believe strongly in the forces of nature and doing what comes natural to them is the way in which they choose to live their lives. Images of nature are seen through out the film, such as blossom trees, pregnant women and corn dollies. One of the most important images in the film is the naked women jumping over the Beltane fire as a ritual. Throughout the film sexuality is flaunted right from the moment the land-lord's daughter dances naked outside Sergeant Howie's bedroom. Even the maypole dancers are celebrating fertility as the may pole is a \"phallic symbol\" as the pupils are taught in the school. No one on the island is ashamed of who they are and they don't dismiss sex as they see it as a natural occurrence.Some might argue that Sergeant Howie is punished at the end of the film for not having their values because he is still a virgin. On the other hand he could be being celebrated because he is worthy enough a sacrifice for their \"God\" Nuada, the sun God.The Wicker Man is an interesting film for analysis because there are many different approaches you could take to it probably due to its many themes and wonderfully, original storyline. The one thing you mustn't do when watching this film is try to analyse it from a logical point of view. You could rip any film apart in terms of logic because you have to remember that any fictional film is purely fantasy, even if this one is a sick one.\nThe only criticism that I could give this film is that the storyline could be very easily ruined for someone from the picture on the front of the video/DVD case which shows the wicker man burning.....which idiot chose that?!?!?They need shooting at dawn....what is the point of watching the film when the ending is broadcast on the front cover?!?hmmmm.....the marketing department were obviously out at lunch when that was being chosen.....However back on track....overall a very stylish, truly British film which will be a cult film for years to come!!!If you haven't already watched it do so....but just don't look at the cover first....hmmmmm...you know my opinion on that....!!!",

            "review_title": "It's a movie",
            "content": "Hello the lovely Isle Of Bute. This movie consistently appears in the business and popular top ten films of all time. Why?As with all horror movies you suspend belief when you watch. What makes a good horror movie very good is making you think if there is an element of truth in it. As with Blair Witch that comfortable boundary we have to get on blindly with our lives is blurred in the movie. Like Blair Witch (and more recently 28 Days) it was made on a shoestring partly to get that home movie look and feel but also because it had to be made cheaply and quickly! It almost didn't happen for a number of real and fictional reasons - again, blurring what is real life and adding to the myth that is the wicker man.I think you need to watch the film before you comment and know a bit about the world around you. There are plenty of small private islands off the west coast of Scotland where palm trees grow and small communities have local practices overlooked by the 'mainland' (a euphemism for the modern world) until they come into conflict with it. Local rituals involving children were investigated on Orkney in the 1990s because the mainland Police didn't understand them - now is that reality following fiction or the other way round?We, the viewer, can dismiss what is going-on on the island because we think we are more civilised and intelligent than them just like Sgt Howie in the film. But in real life people are easily led astray and commit all kinds of foul acts. Is it nurture (how we are brought up) or nature, we are all capable of it? The movie begins by playing on whether you have an open mind or not to this; putting you in the movie. Two Police officers are relaxed over it and say there is nothing to investigate because no law has been broken, so Sgt Howie (Woodward) uses the chance to be the missionary he always wanted to be, going head long in to something he doesn't understand to impose his modern day views on the local 'fools', but as Lord Summerisle (Lee) says at the climax 'No, Sgt Howie it is you that is the fool'. The reference to Paganism is purely a reference point as it is a widely misunderstood religion and most of it can be made up to carry the plot. Sgt Howie is a devote Christian as his views on Pagans are then easily put into context, but that is again a reference point as it is clearly said at the climax that the islanders are relaxed over his beliefs, they wanted him to come as a representative of a supreme being or God (didn't matter which one, but in his case as an officer of the law would do). The film's message is - you are the fool if you don't try to understand other people and impose your views. A message we could heed in real life right now.To put a few facts correct:Paganism is a broad term covering a number of pre-christian religions around the world, celts were northern and western European Pagans. All Britons were celts at one point but worshipped different gods in different ways - wicker being one, druidism another in the west country. Many local rituals continue today and in the case of the movie it was made plain that this had never happened before and was an extreme measure (the horror). In Edinburgh (the Scottish capital) there is a huge festival, famous around the world, where wicker effigies are burnt at the start of the growing season (Beltane, 1 May) and similar festivals around the world.In the film, the island wasn't totally untouched by modern society, Lord Summerisle's (Christopher Lee) great grandfather introduced the religion/ practices to the island so that he could control the workforce to make money for him (a modern Victorian method). There are plenty of religious communities around the world with practices we don't understand.Britt Eckland's 'double' was hidden from her - she didn't know she had one in the film! It was deliberate that she didn't look like her or she might have sued as she did the scenes Britt refused to do at very short notice (the night before!).THE WICKER MAN gets 10 out of ten.",

The juxtaposition of the carefree islanders' joyous pagan religion based in nature with the more macabre elements of ancient customs creates a delectable confusion in Sgt Howie and ourselves.Wonderful evocative music and Christopher Lee are the icing on a cake equally filled with joy and fear. \"Summer is a coming!\"",

The uniqueness of this movie is the product of such an imaginary mind that you rarely see in movies now a days. No other film in history can even come close to its remarkable achievements. The Wicker Man is a musical delight that has music so fitting it helps you become absorbed into the plot line more easily.This will sound like a bizarre things to say, but I believe you can actually judge someone's intelligence on their opinion of this film, all the people who adore this movie are insightful thinkers and seem to know common sense, all the ones who say its OK, are of average intelligence, all the ones who say its terrible are more than not narrow minded people with no mind to think for themselves, they often favour cloned Hollywood non thinking action movies with no spirit or character.This movie is like the God of all other movies ever made.

This view was, however, based on the supposedly butchered British Lion cut that has been the most commonly viewed version over the past few decades. Having since seen the extended director's cut, shown recently on Channel 4, I must say that this seems to be restoration for restoration's sake (not unlike the bum-numbing pointlessness of 'Apocalypse Now Redux').Much of what has been placed back into the film is simply unnecessary. the audience does not need to see any of Sgt. Howie's scenes before his arrival on Summerisle (i.e. preaching in the church, and that awfully acted opener in the Police Station). Elsewhere, plot points that were perfectly legible in the shorter cut are hammered home in a way that begins to border on the patronising.And although Christopher Lee complained heavily that many of his supposedly 'character building' scenes were omitted from the 80-odd minute cut, these seem to amount to little more than a few brooding looks and a spot of poetry. Other scenes involving the inhabitants of Summerisle did benefit from being slightly extended, but for me there was probably 5 minutes maximum of film that marked a true improvement.Having studied both cuts of the film now, I'm willing to put my neck out and say that perhaps British Lion had a point.......",

As far as a recommendation, I would be hard pressed to recommend this film to anyone except for the true horror buff, and only to them because it's basically required watching. If you're looking for a legitimate \"fear-jerker\", I'd go for The Exorcist or The Shining (1980) or for the true film noir, pick up a copy of Kwaidan (1964 from Japan.)

Indeed, unless you are fortunate enough to catch the full version of the film, you STILL may not know what is happening by the end of it!Edward Woodward is Sgt. Howie, a police officer who is also a Presbyterian preacher. He is called to the island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a little girl, but the islanders deny the girl even exists. As he stays on the island, he comes to believe the girl is to be sacrificed during a pagan ceremony, and then sets out to rescue her. It is at this point that the film becomes very unsettling, but to give more away would spoil it for those who have not seen it...Along with Edward, Christopher Lee gives the performance that he considers one of his finest as Lord Summerisle, the laird of the island and their leader in more ways than one. Britt Ekland and Diane Cliento also appear as ladies offering more than just friendship.Some people complain that the film is dated, or that the songs are just a distraction. Not so - the film is deliberatly set up in what might be called the 'Avengers Style', and the songs are an integral part of the film. Look at the scene when Lord Summerisle is singing outside the inn, Britt Ekland is dancing in one room and Sgt. Howie is trying not to think what all normal men would think. The same can be said at the School, where the song while the children dance around the Maypole says much more than you may think.Strangest of all, this film paints a sympathetic portrait of BOTH the Christian viewpoint and the Pagan one, and the ending actually justifies both sides in a very unusual manner.If you haven't seen this film before and come across it, do watch. To know if you have the full version, check if the film opens in Church with Sgt Howie preaching.

In this case, a devout Christian man bumbles along stubbornly trying to find a missing girl in a pagan community.The film is more of a view, almost documentary style, of the pagan community and their adoration for nature, sex, and medicines based on a faith in folklore and natural healing. The community, while bizarre and guarded, is typically peaceful and hospitable. Our protagonist, the police inspector, seems thick headed and incapable of comprehending this religion, mixing his own personal beliefs with his investigation of the missing child. It is only in the last few moments of the film where we see a darker side of this community, and a few moments of horror for the doomed officer. So, if you're looking for terror, you'll find little. If you're looking for blood, you'll find none. But if you're looking for an introspection into old beliefs that were once common and now seem unsettling, looking for a film about two religions from one nation being unable to reconcile, looking for a movie about the dangers of a religious community and their actions in times of desperation, you'll find few better than Wicker Man.Highlighted by a great performance by Christopher Lee.",

Horror movies are defined by having moments of blood being spilled and some kind of gore. And one more thing, the religion practised by the islanders is very valid and still very much alive today. And being of Celtic ancestry myself, I find the way the film represents the old pagan traditions to be quite insulting, i.e 'you don't worship God so you must be condemned'. Nevertheless, it's a very engaging and sinister film, Edward Woodward at by far his best, and some Americans with rather dodgy Scots accents. (Britt Ekland manages very well to do a mixture of a European accent and a Scottish accent. Interesting). But it is not a horror film. It may worry certain people, mostly devout Christian's who think that every other religion is devil-worship, but it is certainly not shocking. The climax, I suppose, is pretty worrying, but it's not like the slasher-flicks where it could happen, I mean, it's certainly completely unlikely you're going to be offered up as a human sacrifice to the sun-god. Now, isn't it?",

            "review_title": "Demonic innocence",
            "content": "I have now watched the director's cut of The Wicker Man, and here are my first impressions. These, I stress, are purely personal and not intended as a guide to how others should respond. NOTE: SOME SPOILERS ABOUT PLOT.The film has a quite unique flavour and atmosphere: I can't think of anything to compare it with. I suppose it gets its atmosphere from its odd and successful blend of evocative scenery, local colour, music (very weird music), the police-murder-investigation theme, and stark clash of faiths embodied in the characters and their interactions. All these elements mesh and interweave with a strange ease and grace.The most enduring sensation it leaves in my mind is that of a pagan society, practising a very corrupt form of paganism. (Human sacrifice is pretty corrupt!) The sense of sexuality and sexual depravity seemed to soak everything, including the scenes with children: the scene in the classroom where the woman teacher is teaching a class of young girls about phallic symbols was particularly unsettling. This pervasive, almost obsessive sensuality, with its air of 'fertility religion' as the essence of life, would have been spiritually unbearable if Sergeant Howie hadn't been present, both as a wholesome contrast and as a vehicle for expressing a strong Christian repugnance to the entire ethos. Because I identified with Howie, it gave me an unpleasant feeling of being isolated and cut off in the midst of this permeating corruption.What made the corruption even more oppressive was its air of innocence. It was like a Satanic fairy-tale, designed to invert Christian values under a veil of naturalness and normality, which ultimately served to bring out the disturbing abnormality of it all. This reached its crescendo at the end, with the lusty communal rendering of 'Summer is a-coming in' by the assembled islanders, while Sergeant Howie is sacrificed. This scene achieved a kind of demonic innocence that was most unnerving.The famous 'seduction scene' with Britt Ekland was, I must admit, not remotely seductive to me. It came across, to my moral sensibilities, as a sort of ritualised desecration of true womanhood, true femininity. It was as if the character Willow had been emptied of her humanity and become a quasi-demonised vehicle for some spirit of pagan sensuality. At one point she even looked possessed: her expression had lost its humanness and become a veritable demon of lust. What saved the scene from being mere pornography was the weird music, which transformed the whole episode into another vibrant and uncanny embodiment of the religion of the islanders. (To get my meaning, imagine how much more obviously and naturally sensual it would have been if it had been set to raw, erotic night-club music.)\nI had mixed feelings about Sergeant Howie. On the one hand, the film went out of its way to portray him as a sincere Christian. It even hinted from the very outset that he would be called on to follow in Christ's footsteps as a martyr: note the very early scene in church where Howie himself reads out the narrative of the institution of holy communion, commemorating Christ's sacrifice on the cross, and then is seen eating the bread and drinking the cup. Manifestly he is a man devoted to 'right', which the islanders exploit to ensnare him, as he bends every effort to finding and rescuing Rowan Morrison from what he believes is her forthcoming nasty demise. Clearly his chastity and virginity are emphasised too: they are crucial to the plot. On the other hand, he is a rather glum, humourless character. He does all the right things, and represents Christian principle, law, and civilisation, but more in the spirit of a dour Old Testament prophet than a New Testament evangelist.But I think I know why the film-makers had to do this. It was to make his fate palatable. If the audience had been led to a really strong emotional bond and identification with Howie, the ending would just have been intolerable. Imagine if Howie had been a woman police officer, young, beautiful, warm, sensitive, compassionate: no one could have endured the finale. It would have seemed like a brutal rape. To make it emotionally endurable, the film has to put some distance between the hero and the audience, and it does this by making him rather one-sidedly masculine, hard, puritanical, authoritarian. This also achieves another desired effect, that of creating the aforementioned air of 'demonic innocence' in the islanders. Their sense of innocence, however perverted, could not have survived had they butchered a hero who had been more redolent of the softer, warmer virtues.One interesting point: what exactly was Howie's brand of Christianity? The psalm singing, and the Highland locale, make one think first of Presbyterianism. But that can hardly be. There are too many references in the film that count against this. At the outset, Howie is said to have some kind of devotion to the Virgin Mary ('The only virgin he's interested in is the Virgin Mary'). The scene in church depicts choirboys clothed in white and Howie receiving stylised pieces of communion bread like round tokens: not very Presbyterian. On the island he speaks in praise of monasteries and makes a wooden cross: more a Catholic trait. And at his martyrdom he regrets dying 'unshrieved' (without absolution from a priest). All this points resolutely away from Presbyterianism in the direction of Roman Catholicism. Yet there's a spanner in the works: in the holy communion scene, Howie receives the wine as well as the bread. This is very unlikely in a Roman Catholic mass in 1973. Even today the wine is still officially with-held from the laity in a Roman Catholic mass, although some churches now offer the wine unofficially. So one must conclude that Howie was a member of the Scottish Episcopal Church who had strong leanings to a Roman Catholic type of piety: a High Church, Anglo-Catholic (or Scoto-Catholic) Episcopalian.",

In the original, they are not saying that modern day pagans living in modern society are violent much less burn any sentient being (any animal be it a chicken or a human) alive. Instead the film makers are using some of the ancient rituals that were bloody when they were believed to have been practiced millenia ago. The society is both hypothetical and isolated. The appeal in the movie is in its quasi Darwinian segregation from our society. They were not subject to the same environmental (or social) pressures that caused change elsewhere in society. It tantalized ones senses in that it emphasized the original use of the rituals that we have reincarnated in our modern life and for those of you that have read Guns, Germs, and Steel, it was almost as if this movie was an inspiration for him (though it was not) but you can see how the needs, rituals, and religions of isolated societies vary from others. To make a plot that is entertaining, thought provoking, and controversial, there is a very dramatic crescendo to the piece. I saw the ending as a metaphor against Christian domination, as he cried out to his god and was not saved. A morbid Daniel and the lion's den. In other words, the original was a good movie if it made you think and a bad movie if you went on emotion alone (and sided against the people in the colony). Hence the reason its a cult classic. Hardly the thing you would expect Nick Cage to \"remake\"",

At that point I was sure we were into something with Python influences but that never materialized or at least it didn't seem to. I would have sworn that in several scenes we were expected to laugh except that the bizarre atmosphere outweighed the humour. Knowing the mentality of the early 70's this was no doubt an attempt at exploring the \"positive\" side of hippiesque paganism(notice all the flatering camera shots of Lee throughout the movie) against the staunchy piousness of establishment christianity but actually turns out to be a very anti-counterculture and anti-religious movie designed to push us all back into our \"security\" of a secular and materialistic existence. Remember when you were younger and glad to come out of some of these movies back into the \"real\" world. The older I got the more suspicious of that I've become. As a suspenseful \"whodidit\" the movie works very well and is fun to follow but the ending seems overly shocking primarily because of the borderline levity that always seems to be wanting to break out of this movie.

There is also a 35-minute documentary which is excellent, revealing many nuggets about the film and also the cast and crew's frustration with the original cut version.

I don't think the people who made it intended it to be a classic monster movie type of horror movie.  Anyways, the film is so hilariously funny with it's soundtrack and its characters (and virgins at their own stonehenge).  There are a few glaring continiuty errors.  This movie is worth seeing-very entertaining and very weird!!!",

            "content": "I recently viewed this picture for the first time, and let me say, I was entirely surprised by what this film had to offer. Let me just begin by saying that I consider myself not only a horror aficionado, but also a fan of well made movies in general. This film however, I found to be very unmoving.The reasons for my disappointment were not from any usual point of criticism such as poor acting, dialog or directing. I think that anybody who sees this movie would agree that it is strong in all three of these areas, it is just that the end result of the movie leaves the viewer unsuspecting and not entirely prepared for the outcome.The Performances by the actors are excellent and passionate. A movie about a secluded Pagan society set in modern times would be difficult to produce with any believability, but this film manages to pull it off.The characters, especially the police officer and Lord Summersisle are the driving forces creating the tension in this film. As has been previously mentioned by other commentators, the movie just isn't that frightening.In the end, it comes off as less of a horror film, and more of a commentary on the hedonism and social decadence of the modern western world. This is done by contrasting ancient pagan rituals with modern attitudes towards physical and sensual pleasure as well as sexual liberation. This film left me not necessarily upset over the conclusion, but more puzzled as to how and why these people lived the way that they did.Lord Summersisle, if he were such a genius and master manipulator, should have just applied for government farm subsidies in secret so that he could fund his pagan society while keeping everyone else in the dark. i mean, they could still sacrifice and everything.",

            "content": "Like many others who have seen these film I enjoyed the soundtrack by the mysterious Paul Giovanni (a Canadian singer/songwriter I think). I bought the CD of the music. Unfortunately the original music tracks have been lost and the CD is a copy of the mono music and effects tapes from the film, so 'Corn Riggs', for example, appears in snippets and with sound effects on top (like the seaplane engine) - pity.One other thing about the soundtrack, I have heard that on 'Willow's Song' Britt Eckland's voice is dubbed by the jazz singer Annie Ross, though it doesn't sound like Annie Ross to me. I have also heard that Annie Ross dubs Britt Eckland's dialogue throughout the whole movie. On a similar note, Britt clearly uses a body double for the full length rear shots of her naked dance during 'Willow's Song' (supposedly because she was pregnant at the time).",
